  i prefer to get to know my men , so i 'd like to know your operational history , talents etc. . . '', 
  `` what talents do you bring to my squad ? , and what are your likes and dislikes ? '', 
  * oveanth salutes back * `` so , new arrival ? '', 
  `` at least we 've got some common ground , absolutely hate those pricks as well , and trust me there are a lot of them . 
  oh and word of warning , beware the ai , do not trust it . 
  it considers us all to be expendable . '', 
  `` yes sir . '', 
  * oveanth see 's the pile of blood bags , he goes behind it , grabs the liquid adhesive and gives it to fire-slug , not disturbed due to him having seen worse . 
  australia here, 
  you people can go all fuck yourselves . 
  `` oh i have n't introduced myself yet have i ? , corporal oveanth of courage company , and leader of bravo squad . 
  and you are ? '', 
  ooc : ohhhh ravatar is fucked, 
  `` uh , yes sir '' * oveanth proceeds with the action * `` your armour is looking awesome already sir , but what about regs ? '', 
  * oveanth happens to be one of the men the lietenant rounded up for the job due to his presence in the armoury *, 
  * oveanth immidietly recognises her face from the time he stared at her in the mess hall and raises his weapon * `` sir , this is the suspect that it is to be apprehended ! '', 
  ooc : / u/temporaryaccount __, 
  / r/the _ donald is your friend . 
  * `` creepy , but that 's definitely going to intimidate the enemy , still fucking creepy though , where did he get these bloodbags '' * , `` so sir , is that phase one clone armour ? '', 
  `` good to meet you , so whose unit are you in ? '', 
  `` i heard the kaminoan armorsmiths accidentally made it super uncomfortable , or at least we were told this back in history class . '', 
  * `` alright i 'm genuinely creeped out now '' * `` sir , if their is n't any task for me to do i 'll take my leave . '', 
  im going to enjoy this . 
  `` uh , yes sir '' * oveanth answers truthfully , he does n't intend on telling anyone so he does n't earn fire-slugs wrath *, 
  `` anyways have a good time on the * evictus * private , i must be going now . '', 
  `` uh , alright sir '' * oveanth leaves *, 
  im free on monday , wednesday , thursday , friday after 5:00 pm , and sat + sun is all day . 
  [ ooc ] shits goin down yo . 
  * `` god dammit , oh well i was getting sick of having my remaining credits stolen '' *, 
  oveanth just sitting there eating his meal, 
  `` private , good to see you again . 
  take a seat , the chef is serving some food from my homeworld of courascant . '', 
  `` so how are you enjoying the evictus so far ? '', 
  `` oh , and how does it provide more then you imagine ? '', 
  `` the * evictus * is amazing is n't it ? , i could get lost in the air ducts . 
  the facilities are all exceptional , but that 's standard for all star destroyers . '', 
  `` that 's debatable , but the empire is definitely great though . 
  anyways i do n't know much about you personally , tell me about yourself . '', 
  `` a fellow courascanti i see . 
  i was born to a somewhat poor family back there , not too poor but enough to be lower then the middle class . 
  when i was around 10 or 11 my family moved off world to some corporate mining world . 
  when i got older i decided i did n't want to be some miner , and signed up . '', 
  `` yeah my childhood background is ordinary , but my career has been definitely abnormal . '', 
  `` you got a future ahead of you in the empire , do n't worry your moments will come and go . '', 
  corporal oveanth and his squad breach inside a compartment and kill the rebels inside , before continuing their way around the ship , taking out any rebels in their way . 
  if you kill your enemy , they win - trudeu, 
  so the canadian won in the end . 
  corporal oveanth and his squad was moving through small compartments and engineering taking out any rebels along the way . 
  and capturing 2 . 
  corporal oveanth personally snuck timed detonators into the engine bay , but only did structural damage , and can be repaired . 
  `` no problem , besides ive got a few stories to tell , everyone does eventually . '', 
  organising people , not too squeamish , good at scavenging in urban environments , sneaky , and self professed tactician . 
  `` well , i was stationed on kashyyyk a while back , one of the manual labour deportation camps on the far side of the world , have you by any chance heard of the life day massacre ? '', 
  `` of course , it 's something the corps did n't want getting out , anyways i was stationed on the far side of the planet , only ships we would get would be transport craft bringing in or taking out personnel or wookies , we were used to dealing with the usual single wookies escape attempt , but ... '', 
  `` well the day that happened was different , i was doing patrol in the early hours of the morning , the usual stuff ya ` know , but as i was passing the officer barracks i heard shouting , i walked in to find a wookies strangling the officers to death , by the time i tackled the wookie the officers were dead . 
  i fought that wookie , that wookie is a reminder of what happens when one tries to claw your face off * as he points to his scar * '', 
  `` i went outside only to hear a battle taking place , i took a stray shot to the stomach , and long story short i gathered the survivors and killed all the wookies , but it was a massacre on both sides . '', 
  i sneezed 3 times going to the fridge , do n't worry it 's all good . 
  crap, 
  crap, 
  `` indeed it was , by the end of it our armour was either destroyed or completely bathed in blood , either our own or a wookies . 
  kashyyyk is a brutal place for the newcomers trust me . '', 
  `` it was , hell of a story though , at least i got that out of this , i 'm fine with aliens but i do n't think i can handle wookies any more . '', 
  `` anyway away from my story , did you get any rebels in the battle ? '', 
  `` good job , a few less rebels to worry about . '', 
  `` soo , any other topic ? '', 
  there have been numerous studies showing the iq disparity between different races , with black people scoring lower , especially australian aboriginals , and europeans and east asians often scoring higher , but i attribute this to genetics and cultural environment factors . 
  not only that but every ethnic group has lived in their own part of the world for thousands of years , evolution obviously plays a huge role , and denying that is simply delusional . 
  there have also been numerous studies indicating that the more multi-ethnic a community gets , the bigger social cohesion decreases , as well as trust , this does n't mean all minority groups do this , but when you import a large foreign race/culture/group then you get the results of racial diversity, 
  ( black pidgeon speaks has a very good video on this subject , i recommend seeking his channel out ), 
  / r/empiredidnothingwrong, 
  although the human rights breaches are appalling , you do n't seem to get that they are illegal immigrants , and that we have the toughest border security policy on the planet , people die at sea and deterring them from coming in the first place is important . 
  i do n't think you people understand we ca n't afford to be moral , we simply can not , numerous nations have also had the similar problem of not being able to afford being moral . 
  i do n't think hitler was a case of `` we ca n't take the moral high ground '', 
  on another point , britain abolished slavery when they could afford to be moral , america abolished slavery when they could afford to be moral , but before then their economies were dependant on slavery . 
  this isnt to say we arent preventing people from immigrating , most immigrants are here legally , not through the illegal and life threatening boat journeys , if we just accept boat people then we can often come across uneducated , unskilled laborers , rather then people who take the time to go through the correct channels . 
  oveanth had just come out of the mess hall , feeling full and confident nothing could ruin his day . 
  `` uh ma'am , good to see you , i 'm doing fine this fine day thank you . 
  what about you ? '', 
  `` uhhhm , i did n't really have much planned no , but hey open to suggestions . 
  anyways im itching for my next operation . '', 
  but the thing about australia is that we are surrounded by relatively safe nations , if you want to get to australia so bad then go through indonesia legally . 
  can you please reproduce . 
  not parent but cousin . 
  little cousin had tab open called `` how to get revenge '' . 
  lel , similar boat . 
  against race mixing , yet i 'm all yellow fever and shit , + ex gf is chinese . 
  wat do ? 
  cheers on the advice , but i was n't dating my ex because of her race but it was a plus in my eyes at the time .

  * sad * news . 
  srsly tho that kinda sucks for them . 
  when do the vehicles ever see action ? 
  it would actually be amazing if they actually developed nukes secretly and nobody found out . 
  not on reddit, 
  `` it looks like france needs another occupation '', 
  well shit . 
  where 's my free women inshallah ? 
  it should be a mix between protecting animals and using them as a resource , to not eat and hunt animals would be denying us our own nature as omnivores , however we need to have it regulated to ensure animal species do n't die out .
