is n't this how you 're supposed to do it ? 
  why is this impressive ? 
  why do over half the gym bros at my gym only ever use the cable cross ? 
  they do everything in it . 
  flys , curls , tricep pushdown things , cable crunches etc. 
  literally they only use this , no other machines or free weights . 
  i 've seen this happen with about ten people now and i 'm so confused as to why it 's so popular, 
  my hobby is to be horribly depressed and do nothing all day feeding my depression because i 'm lonely and do nothing all day :'\\ ^ ), 
  most hypertrophy programs say 3-4x8-12 is the best . 
  if you can do more than that you need to put on more weight, 
  how can i get in if you 've blocked the door ? 
  but someone 's put a chair under the handle so i ca n't even open the door to get in, 
  kids watching youtube mash the touchscreen of ipads and the like which cause weird dislike numbers and the nonsense comments you see in the comment section . 
  it 's almost all kids, 
  the same thing happened with the ender 's game trailer . 
  saw it and just thought `` cool '' then the reddit comments freaked the fuck out and spoiled it for everyone else who had n't read the book, 
  judging by how common obesity is , living to eat is * very * common, 
  this is my nightmare . 
  srs has been dead for a while , it 's not 2013 any more, 
  this was the most productive day of the sub and you want to shut it down ? 
  - ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) \u256f \u2572 ___ \u5350\u5350\u5350\u5350 do n't mind me just taking my mods for a walk, 
   and small percentage ... well , let 's just say australia has the highest views per capita when it comes to our content . 
  i personally claim responsibility for this, 
  30 reps in as many sets as it takes ? 
  like 5x6 or 3x10 etc ? 
  stick to what 's known , 5x5 for main compound lifts and 3x8-12 for hypertrophy insolation stuff . 
  if you can do a lot more then it 's not enough weight, 
  do manlets really think 5 ' 9 is tall for a woman ? 
  what on earth, 
  2000 calories should never be dinner unless you 've barely eaten all day or you 've eaten a little that day and are bulking, 
  must suck being a manlet then rofl, 
  because they 're genetically inferior and will always be worse off than a tall ubermensch like myself , so it 's funny, 
  #soft drink, 
  yes , he also plays ginsberg in mad men pictured here, 
   guys, 
   females, 
  why, 
  smith machine squats are infinitely better than no squats at all, 
  yup have n't played for months because i beat earth and the moon balancing was awful, 
  sanders is a joke and will never be president, 
   oriental, 
  thanks dad, 
   voat ... an escape from shills here on reddit and a place to get real info . 
  this is what conspiracy theorists actually believe, 
  but that 's how it 's pronounced ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ atleast ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ radelaide, 
  bloody victorians, 
   defamation is not a joke . 
  but you are :\\ ^ ), 
  it was milf power hour at my gym apparently when i went yesterday , definitely increased prs, 
  i 'd probably do [ icf ] ( https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout ) then , it 's three days a week full-body workout with a rest inbetween each workout with two rest days in a row at the end of the week . 
  it 's also two workouts ( workout a and workout b ) you alternate so it looks like this arbrarr/brarbrr/repeat, 
  holy shit i 've been looking for this for ages and every time i searched for it i only found that swedish gay chicken video . 
  thank you !, 
  any squats are better than no squats . 
  the difference over 2 months is n't that much and you 'll be able to get right in to it with a proper gym once you 've finished at your current one, 
  i deleted the save : /, 
   protien being non-fat usable it 's turned into pee after you reach your bodies needed amount ( usually 30mg ) . 
  hahaha what ? 
  bodybuilders ( and most people trying to gain weight from the gym should ) eat 200g + a day and it 's not just peed out, 
  how so ? 
  if i eat 3500 kcal more than i need i gain a pound , if i eat 3500kcal less than i need , i lose a pound . 
  does n't matter if it 's over a week or a month , that 's how losing or gaining weight works . 
  pretty fun , wish we could choose to accept alliances or not instead of just the game saying `` no they 're not trustworthy '' or whatever . 
  i died on day 1930 with my last character ( me ) being murdered by varys . 
  a problem i had is i never had any money , i do n't know how people here are commenting on having thousands of soldiers because i barely had more than a few hundred at a time . 
  maybe i spent too much on trying to kill people, 
  edit : it was very fun when i got attacked by robb stark and 3 seconds later i murdered him via the sand vipers . 
  why are fat people fat then ? 
  with two dudes and food ? 
  me too thanks, 
   it 's like the difference between being antisemitic and anti-zionist . 
  nothing ? 
  you 're not a professional bodybuilder, 
  you do n't know me , you do n't know my life, 
  thank mr skeltal, 
  overhead press and lateral raises, 
  gamergate has n't been relevant for like a year,

  \\  reading stickies, 
  is it hurting your fee fees ? 
  men are so emotional, 
  it 's not repugnant to me , it 's just plain ignorant :\\ ^ ),
