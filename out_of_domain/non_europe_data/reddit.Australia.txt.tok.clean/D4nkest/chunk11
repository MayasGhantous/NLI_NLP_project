  and do multiple variations , add in preacher curls or the machine curls, 
  can you get a refund ? 
  edit : give a look here , not much difference apparently but it 's more expensive needlessly : http://examine.com/faq/what-is-the-best-form-of-creatine.html, 
  should be the same just check the serving suggestion as it might be different than the 5g per day recommended for monohydrate, 
  bulkings purpose is to gain one pound a week by eating at a 500 calorie surplus daily . 
  if you cut by 500 every second day the net result is 0 surplus , 0 deficit , so you should n't gain any weight . 
  kinda silly in my opinion . 
  just bulk, 
  i 'd suggest single arm db rows then and see if that still hurts your butt because you 're supporting your body with your knee and arm instead of just your legs, 
  android users do n't pay for iaps as much as apple users by a significant factor, 
  it 's only 0.6 g per pound of protein required , or 1.32 g per kilogram . 
  1550 is a good amount to lose weight depending on how tall/heavy you are just keep at it . 
  creatine does put on weight but it is intramuscular and makes your muscles bigger , not fat . 
  i put on more than 3 pounds just from creatine alone, 
  man how am i 80kg and still look tiny . 
  nice work dude , love the arms, 
  does anyone know where you can get wireless in-ear earphones in australia that are under $ 50 ? 
  the music at my gym is starting to grate on me, 
  old guy was doing leg extensions a couple machines over while i 'm doing lat pulldown yesterday and he kept looking at me so i just thought he was weird . 
  as soon as i finish up and go get some water from the fountain i look back and he 's on it . 
  you can ask how many sets i have or if you want to work in old man, 
  then he proceeded to do lat pulldown facing the wrong way ( ?? ), 
  making it look like the shoulder press machine but reversed . 
  no idea how he did n't fly up or if that 's an actual thing people do, 
  i like the delts and arms, 
  you need to go outside to meet grills, 
  i did n't see how much he put on but he was cable rowing more than be about 15 minutes prior so it 's unusual . 
  i wonder what the benefit of that is , or what he thinks the benefit is, 
   this item does not ship to australia . 
  please check other sellers who may ship internationally . 
  i cry, 
  they have some locally but they 're all $ 90-150 and i ai n't paying that much . 
  i 'll keep looking, 
  siri thinks i 'm trying to say `` row '' . 
  bloody accents, 
  typical victorian propaganda . 
  do people boil meat ? 
  is that a thing that happens ? 
  sounds gross, 
  i have n't had soup in years and ca n't recall meat ever being in any . 
  maybe a stew but that 's different being in a slow cooker . 
  is it literally just put in boiling water ? 
  or is it like stock/the beginnings of a soup, 
  thanks , nice to see a different perspective on something so common to me, 
  the road trips across australia were the greatest ones, 
  ur mom is a screenshot, 
  i have more memes than blood running through my veins, 
  me as well comrade \u262d, 
  i went from 40 to 45 today , gon na smash 47.5 in a few days, 
  ppl is one of the most recommended routines lol , glad you 're on it though i love it, 
  i 'll be there within a month or so . 
  feels great to hit a goal, 
  is it your one rep max or for reps ? 
  if you feel fine and can finish that much work i 'd say it 's okay to do . 
  there 's no such thing as overdoing it if you can keep going without injury , you clearly get enough rest between leg days so go hard . 
  i 'd probably drop the reps on squats and do more weight but it 's all up to you, 
  have you had a look at this beginner routine ? 
  this is postmodern art, 
  i 've lived in adelaide for ten years and i have no idea what frog cakes are . 
  what am i missing out on ? 
   tifu by cumming on my dogs face . 
  god damn it reddit, 
  das it . 
  imagine how strong you 'll be by the end of the year, 
  woke up with trap doms for the first time ever . 
  the only thing i added yesterday was another tricep cable exercise . 
  very confused . 
  also my core is weak as shit and it 's super noticeable doing tricep pushdowns :( i need to add more than just hanging leg raises to leg day, 
  nescafe instant coffee that i use is only like 60mg per teaspoon lol, 
  me too . 
  considering making rest day arm day as my arms are lagging hard . 
   procedural content generation and permadeath, 
  but this is what people want from the term `` rogue-like '' not the turn based or anything, 
  guy pearce in prometheus playing a ~ 100 year old peter weyland when he was 44, 
  that sounds cool , let us know how it goes if you get to one, 
  me too except my definition has n't changed, 
  not neccessarily .

  do n't forget thermogenics, 
  turn adblock off for the page, 
  just say `` nah i 'm good tonight '' and do n't take any home . 
  easy, 
  the first part is just dumb , ignore it . 
  people worry about benching without a spotter in case you fuck up , but you can usually just do the roll of shame or ( carefully ) dump the weights from one side if you do n't use clips, 
  a 20kg plate is the equivalent of a 45 pound plate and is what a `` plate '' means, 
  what do you think happens if you lose weight `` too fast '' ? 
  people have cut on way more than that and have been fine . 
  and you will not lose muscle if you keep lifting during the cut, 
  regular plates are fine . 
  do they have a deadlift area ? 
  or some mats you could use to not damage the floor as much on deadlifts ? 
  people at my gym deadlift with some mats we have for bodyweight exercises under both sides of the bar,
