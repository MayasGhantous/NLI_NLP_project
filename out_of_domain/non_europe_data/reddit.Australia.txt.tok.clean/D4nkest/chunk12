  try to find an open spot for deads . 
  barbell rows are fine in a power cage imo, 
  it 's not too long if you 're actually using it . 
  let people work in if they ask though so you do n't get accused of hogging it, 
  apparently your test peaks at 7 days without ejaculation and then goes back to normal . 
  so technically if you want to be at `` peak '' test then masturbate or have sex once a week .

  sorry i 'll need someone else to chime in about that , i 'm only familiar with cutting from a bodybuilding perspective where they do n't have too much fat to begin with, 
  if there 's nowhere else than just do it in front of the rack , or ask the management what you should do, 
  as for lifting with doms , do it . 
  exercise actually helps doms despite it feeling sore, 
  only for literally one day though , so not that great overall, 
  have you tried your 1rm ? 
  i know but at this point i 'd say the roguelite fanbase is a lot bigger than actual roguelikes, 
  not normal but not unheard of , i think more popular in europe ? 
  we do n't have them at any gyms in my area of australia, 
  holy crap was not expecting that heavy haha . 
  nice work . 
  do you have any mates that lift ? 
  maybe invite them over to show them how strong you are and make them spot you, 
  what gym ? 
  a chain or local ? 
  huh . 
  i go to anytime too in radelaide and they do n't have them nor do some other gyms around it i took trials at, 
  gamers in general . 
  it 's one of the most common hobbies , you 're not a nerd just because you play video games, 
  your muscles start getting smaller at 5 % bodyfat , no sooner,

   * experiened extreme sleep deprivation, 
   * didnt lose muscle mass till ~ 5 % bodyfat . 
  i assume this is what you meant ? 
  no one has ever used that word except to tell other people what it means, 
  can you show us a picture of what you mean like big and round ? 
  the men you have pictured have a low body fat percentage so you will look like that presumably once you have cut, 
  five meals a day ... 
  it sucks but you got ta do it, 
   what is the best workout routine to lose both fat and preserve muscle ? 
  because i love posting this , you will not lose muscle at all until you 're very very low bodyfat .

  or she wants to feel feminine after her boobs got really small from cutting down to her current bodyfat percentage . 
  it 's extremely common in female bodybuilding and it 's not for other people . 
  it 's for her, 
  the second picture is just what muscular people look like . 
  the third one could be more cut but that 's also what muscular people look like . 
  you 're not going to look shredded at 15 % bodyfat or whatever , just keep at it and cut hard to ~ 10 %, 
  / r/all has arrived, 
  almost everyone that is a professional bodybuilder is on gear , even tonnes of amateurs . 
  super common . 
  ca n't we go back to upvoting dog shit to the front page ?
