  still going at it but fucking hell , ca n't wait until i 'm big enough to cut, 
  edit : also fuck sleeping . 
  i sleep 8-10 hours a night and i still feel tired as fuck in the afternoon . 
  edit2 : okay it 's friday night and i 'm angry . 
  fuck couples at the gym with their cutesy spotting eachother and being happy, 
  i am a 19 year old man , but close enough right ? 
  genetics can fuck my small wrists all they want but i still want bigger forearms :(, 
  might try this actually . 
  i ca n't do deads at my gym which i 've heard are good for forearms so i need to up my isolation game, 
  for which exercise ? 
  ^ ^ my ^ ^ calves ^ ^ are ^ ^ actually ^ ^ growing ^ ^ but ^ ^ not ^ ^ my ^ ^ forearms ^ ^ at ^ ^ least ^ ^ so ^ ^ far, 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  i 'll try squeezing it harder tomorrow, 
  people usually have no idea you 're not supposed to vote or comment in linked threads on reddit . 
  it 's the most common way to get banned, 
  nah they still talk like crazy in countries that do n't have tips . 
  thankfully most of them get the hint that i do n't want to talk . 
  hairdressers from women 's salons are the worst offenders in my experience, 
  i 'm always impressed at how he manages to look babyfaced with that shitty beard, 
  what do n't you like about srs ? 
  using an example of a liberal sub that is the most hated subreddit by general ledditors to help your argument of reddit not being conservative ? 
  / r/videos, 
  i honestly do n't know what to tell you then if you do n't believe redditors are brogressive conservatives, 
  racist , homophobic , transphobic ideologies are 100 % conservative . 
  why do you think reddit is liberal ? 
  just because they smoke weed and want gay marriage does not make reddit liberal . 
  there would n't be subs to call out reddits shitty users if reddit did n't have shitty users . 
  when there are thousands of upvotes for conservative comments in default subreddits you can infer that a large portion of the userbase agrees with it, 
  no , there 's thousands of brogressive comments . 
  actual liberal users are downvoted and shamed . 
  look up what a brogressive is , it perfectly describes the average redditor . 
  why is it `` very liberal '' to not be a piece of shit by the way ? 
  you have the strangest post history . 
   and you 're just as xenophobic against outsiders as any klan meeting . 
  we just hate white men . 
   being short is the worst thing ever . 
  i would rather die than be a short male . 
  this but unironically, 
  please be trolling, 
  yes you 're a racist, 
  i mean i did say i hate white men : ^ ), 
  you can generalize reddit based off of what it highly upvotes consistently . 
  oy vey i 'm in there :\\ ^ ), 
   minecraft , anyone ? 
  two years and counting ... 
  more like 5-6 years, 
  i know right ? 
  minecraft modding got me into programming in high school and i 've come so far since then haha, 
  those are natty ? 
  wtf ^ ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ small, 
  i 'd say i 'm only around 16 % but thanks . 
  i might bring it up with my doctor soon, 
  hopefully its true for me :'), 
   years ago , when i was in the 6th grade , i encountered my first nigger classmate . 
  i even had the misfortune of sitting right next to it . 
   it throw a paper on the teacher then blamed it on me . 
  i have never seen someone make such an outright lie before , i was literally left speechless . 
  is this all it takes for them to hate an entire race of people ? 
  that is weak, 
  why does porn have such this weird effect on these dudes lives ? 
  so fucking weird, 
  if you 're one of those shitstains you should say `` we '' not `` they '' like you 're not . 
  it 's pretty normal to be intolerant of intolerance, 
  what is you guys ' row to squat amount ? 
  my 5x5 for each is 135 row , 120 squat . 
  that 's in pounds . 
  i feel like it 's unbalanced but i 'm curious by how much, 
  thanks . 
  my bench is catching up to the row but my rows have gone up faster than my squat or bench . 
  i guess once it stalls they 'll take over, 
  i 've only been training for around 3 months so by the end of the year it should look closer to that , 
  yes . 
  keep taking it, 
  it 's unironically filled with narcissists and edgy college kids blaming their problems on their parents, 
  form is fine , i 've been progressing at the standard rate now it just started low and i got stuck for a month learning how to do it properly, 
  i do n't doubt it but the sub seems more of a `` look how bad i had it guys , are n't i cool with my nmom '' or whatever childish descriptors they use for their normie parents, 
  inspiretaker would n't even be that good , it 's much harder to use than undertaker as you can only use it once a turn and a hero power is significantly worse than a minion with deathrattle, 
  i really prefer the preset decks over building my own . 
  had a tonne of fun with this one but if the current pattern of preset/build your own/preset/build your own stays i 'll be skipping this weeks . 
  i played this one so much . 
  lots of crazy moments and i actually did my first quest in weeks, 
  i guess i do n't understand how it is to be addicted to porn , self-diagnosed or not, 
  i managed two with 19kg assist yesterday . 
  one day we 'll make it, 
  soreness has no relation to how well you worked your muscles . 
  keep going hard, 
  this . 
  currently running pplpplax over one week, 
  there 's only so much muscle you can gain naturally . 
  the massive dudes with forearms bigger than your head are over 300 pounds but that 's just not possible without gear . 
  why do people even go to srssucks any more ? 
  is n't kia where they all go to now ? 
  no one is looking like this naturally http://i.imgur.com/9hq8pgv.jpg . 
  and that 's okay , if you want to you can jump on the bike and go a few laps yourself and you might end up maybe half as big as they are, 
  i 'm angry that that sub is n't about the greatest video game ever made, 
  literally triggers me, 
  srssucks is antisrs 2.0 so does that make kia antisrs 3.0 ? 
  you can do it basically forever until you get less than 10 % bodyfat . 
  make sure you re-adjust your tdee every month or so or your initial -500 will become your maintenance, 
  they do this in australia .
