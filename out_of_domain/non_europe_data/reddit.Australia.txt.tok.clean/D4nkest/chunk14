  wtf , do american doctors actually just write prescriptions by hand ? 
  how are they not easily forged, 
  yes i 'd suggest cutting to 13-15 % then bulk . 
  you 'll look better and feel better doing it than just eating maintenance . 
  it 's also more effective, 
  if you 're not just satisfied with sl5x5 , you can try the accessories added by [ icf5x5 ] ( https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout ) , but really the rest days are for resting . 
  if you do n't like resting then you could try a 6 day a week program like [ this beginner ppl routine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  even that has one rest day a week because you need it, 
  front squats are better than smith machine . 
  where are you getting the bar from ? 
  i mean you could if you wanted to , it 's just faster to start at 13 . 
  it would n't benefit you any more than looking leaner for longer, 
  reddit atheists are the worst . 
  edit :, 
   not surprising : people at rehab have the goal of getting better and embracing reality . 
  people at a mosque have the goal of staying dumb and avoiding reality . 
  was the post, 
  yeah okay front squats then if no one minds , 
   i was her `` almost boyfriend '' for over a year before i started to really acknowledge the fact that something was n't right . 
  i was getting strung along . 
  sure , i got some action here and there , and we really did seem like close friends ( i spent most weekends with her ) , but somehow , she kept finding other guys to `` officially date '' . 
  that would last a few weeks or months , she 'd break up with them for some reason or another ( always leading me to believe it was for me ) , she 'd seduce me again , and a few weeks later she 'd have a new guy . 
  [ found a picture of the guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fsubvnd.png ), 
  good luck bro , go smash some heavy ass weights tomorrow !, 
  ( or rest if its your rest day ), 
  all the more reason to go for a ride once you 've gotten there, 
  monday , tuesday , wednesday , thursday , friday , saturday , sunday , monday, 
  i am perfectly okay with spoopy skeletons in my country thanks, 
  i think most people do n't know how stuff should fit, 
  does anyone else have a super veiny side of their upper body ? 
  just standing relaxed with no pump my right chest shoulder and arm veins are super noticeable but are almost invisible on the other side of me : / it makes me uncomfortable wearing tank tops, 
  uh shit . 
  white men must die . 
  mras need to be castrated . 
  terps should be hung . 
  racists should be contained, 
  i assume most of us are the first one, 
  because we do n't want to see racists like you shitting up the better parts of reddit . 
  this is fucking gross . 
  and they will turn around and blame filthy feminazis instead of other men for perpetuating this bullshit . 
  sigh, 
  hahaha i love this exchange, 
  but we ca n't call both sides skeletons , then it just gets confusing, 
  8 second animation for joust ? 
  god help us all, 
  does n't caffeine have a 6 hour half life ? 
  i think i learned that at school, 
  i had something similar with shrugs and could barely move my neck for hours without it hurting . 
  took the next day off but it was fine the day after that . 
  so did you smash ? 
  lol i do n't think / u/spez actually wanted to ban these dudes or he would have when he banned rapingwomen etc. 
  all the backlash must have changed his mind, 
  til ben brode was racist / s, 
  do upgrades going black mean anything ? 
  man i thought warlizard was cool , ah well, 
  bagels are n't really a thing outside of america, 
  np.reddit has not been and will never be endorsed by reddit itself, 
  okay thanks, 
  you ca n't bump reddit threads , the only thing that makes it more visible is upvoting it which you can only do once, 
  there was some pretty good hate in the `` sprint for abs '' aka lose 5 pounds while already having visible abs = more visible abs thread, 
  i 'm staying up for the wow expansion announcement at 1:30 am my time and i have to be up at 7 . 
  rip todays gains, 
  mists of pandaria was actually pretty good and miles better than the current one . 
  they went from 10m subs last december to 5.4 m on the 4th of august . . hopefully the next one is legit good, 
  whats your physique like ? 
  hahah that total goob face at 1:28,

  god i want those arms, 
  my calves are starting to get tight in my jeans :( :, 
  i hate how it feels . 
  they 're not big only like 16-17 '' and the jeans have no stretch to them so they feel suffocating if i start to get a slight calf pump walking uphill, 
  [ ub101 's ] ( http://theunbrandedbrand.com/products/ub101-skinny-fit-indigo-selvedge ), 
  your abs will not be that great if you 're only doing compounds . 
  i 'd add hanging leg raises and cable crunches ( at least ) twice a week, 
  it has n't been proven to nor has it been disproven to . 
  just take it, 
  why do you think rice should make you fat ? 
  rice is usually used for people cutting along with broccoli, 
  give this a read : http://examine.com/supplements/creatine/, 
   creatine confers a variety of health benefits , including neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties . 
  it also improves power output and is often used by athletes to increase high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass . 
   creatine 's main action in the body is storing high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine . 
  during periods of stress , phosphocreatine releases energy to aid cellular function . 
  this is what causes strength increases after creatine supplementation , but this action can also aid the brain , bones , muscles and liver . 
  most of the benefits of creatine are provided through this mechanism . 
  how many does it say he 's getting ? 
  the site is down for me . 
  he used to regularly get 10-15k just from no one else streaming at the same time as him so if it 's around that then i believe it, 
  i 've had them for a while and i thought they 'd be fine because the thighs have a few inches i could fill in ; i did n't expect the calves to be the weak link :(, 
  you can have any protein you want to fit your protein goals . 
  shakes , bars , chicken breast , mcdonald 's . 
  it 'd be extra fat that serves no purpose . 
  take it slow at 1 pound a week or you 'll regret it when it 's time to cut, 
  i personally would n't as it would increase the calories you need every day . 
  have you talked to your doctor ? 
   it 's crossfit if you did n't notice . 
  injury is the goal [ +195 ], 
  even managed to fit in le crossfit may may .
