  we did it roddit, 
   see , if i do n't smoke , or drink , i do n't sleep a wink . 
  no problem here at all . 
  you ca n't get addicted guys !, 
   hipster jeans, 
  most people ohp and barbell row in the power cage at my gym , there 's just nowhere else to do it and no other barbells so might as well use the cage if that 's where the barbell lives . 
  you ca n't squat `` too low '' , it 's actually better to squat lower than above parallel . 
  they 're expensive is the only downside really . 
  and you do n't need that much protein unless you 're like 300 pounds, 
  are you holding your arms out in front of you while you bodyweight squat ? 
  bodyweight squats are much easier than barbell for me . 
  i 'm 6 ' 2 ( longer legs ) and have no problem with squatting either way, 
  i do n't believe it has been confirmed yet , but most likely . 
  wait for the q&a stream on sunday, 
  how do they ruin the game ? 
  everyone and their nan has leveled up thousands of times so it just skips the monotony of doing it for the 2600th time, 
   rogues with guns also makes sense lore wise . 
  nothing screams rogue like loud bangs, 
  have you tried a different ( wider/narrower ) stance or pointed your feet out/in more ? 
  they announced it at the end of the steam announcing the expansion 1:18:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1wiel4hrva&amp;t=1h18m, 
  standing calf raises ( weighted ) ? 
  i do 5x15 supersetted with an ab exercise also 5x15 ( cable crunches or hanging leg raises ) . 
  i mean it 's not that crazy , the expansion has been out for like 9 months now, 
  i 'd add calf raises and abs to leg day , and shrugs to pull if your traps are lagging, 
  they 're really not that skinny . 
  i would classify them as `` slim-straight '' at most ; there is no taper from the knee down and the thigh is roomy, 
  position 1000 ? 
  i was 5000 + on frostmourne for the wod launch weekend . 
  honestly might skip the first week or two of the expansion for this to go back down to only a few hundred, 
  : v is not a laughing emoticon either lol, 
  0.8 g per pound is the upper limit , with 0.6 g the `` normal '' amount you should be having, 
  fuuuuck, 
  yeah . 
  i 'd cuff more so the bottom of them does n't look so weird but its up to you, 
  3.5 months of lifting +4 months of antidepressants has been great for mental gains . 
  if any of you bros are feeling down a lot you should see your doctor and get a referral for a psychiatrist , 
  also today i broke in to the next colour of dumbbells for my single arm row . 
  the weights are colour coded with a little badge/cap thing on each side and go red for 12-20kg , grey for 22-30kg , blue for 32-40kg and black for 42-60kg . 
  i am now a member of the blue club and it feels so much manlier , especially after starting at 10kg haha, 
  haha oh my , where did that happen ? 
  to be fair i 've never seen the 50 + ones used so it 's probably not cost effective, 
  calf doms are one of my favourite doms . 
  the feeling of doing heavy calf raises with calf doms is orgasmic, 
   [ class halls are ] a private club house that only paladins can go into , only rogues can go into , in the sewers of dalaran for example . 
  rogue class hall is the sewers then ? 
  i 'm going to miss them if they are, 
  it 's clearly my opinion and i was n't forcing it on him . 
  relax, 
  yeah i know . 
  they were a fun hangout in wotlk so if they 're restricted to rogues i 'm going to miss watching the duels and sitting at the bar, 
  does asmongold ever see sunlight in his attic ? 
  it 's always dark in his videos, 
  jack appropriating australian culture is honestly the cringiest shit, 
  there 's an aspect for each kind of domain, 
  deathwing ( then thrall then ?? 
  ) : earth, 
  nozdormu : time, 
  malygos ( now kalecgos ? 
  ) : magic, 
  ysera : emerald dream, 
  lol i went to see how shitty / r/mensrights is nowadays and found [ le gem ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9wh4ehz.png ), 
   less reactionary, 
   any year, 
  i do n't think it 's based on the programming thing , it 's just `` funny '' to answer yes to a x or y question, 
  not for everest, 
  you 're going to get yelled at for using the / u / part , take it out, 
  alright lads so today i 'm doing my thing at the gym when i notice this guy doing one of the weirdest things i 've seen at the gym . 
  our plates are [ like so ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r46ua99.jpg ) with the holes on them and this guy was set up in the power cage doing some squats . 
  pretty normal , lots of people squat ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( half ^ ^ ^ ^ repping ^ ^ ^ ^ motherfuckers \\ ) . 
  but then i notice his form . 
  his arms . 
  he had his arms spread out wide , hands through the holes in the plates and holding on to the rim instead of the usual position . 
  i honestly thought he looked like a majestic little bird . 
  here 's a [ shitty paint diagram ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sibm29i.png ) of what i witnessed . 
  is bird form a thing ? 
  i wish i was there longer to see his unique form of other exercises, 
  if you spent the three seconds it takes to view his history it seems he calls shit out in kia, 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right th ere right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my sel\uff46 i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ) mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20\uff2foo\uff2fo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  no one at my gym competes and i 'm in australia so probably not haha, 
  people shit all over taylor swift for saying she 's irish or some shit because the guy she was dating was irish . 
  jack is american as fuck and not one of us . 
  apparently tumblr, 
   this text became popular on tumblr after a post made on 24 may 2015 in which the text followed the statement `` birds that bob their head back and forth and peep really fast when they fly away `` . 
  who started this brigade ? 
  so bizarre . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxarjhp.png ) is my / r/all right now, 
  i did n't say he did , i said it was equivalent to . 
  he 's as yanky redneck as they come so he needs to relax with pretending to be australian, 
  he can do whatever he likes and i can call him out on his faux-australian crap . 
  he 's 100 % american . 
  he 's not australian-american like he seems to think . 
  the australian flag on the rocket league lets play almost made me unsub because of all his constant appropriation, 
  he is not australian so yes he does not get to abuse our culture when he is a yank living in america, 
  i do n't want some fat yank trying to represent australia in any medium . 
  he 's american he 's not allowed to use my flag . 
  i do n't go waving the chinese flag around because i 'm not chinese, 
  i 'm allowed to use the australian flag because i am australian . 
  americans hate their own shit country so much they need to pretend to be from somewhere else as well like `` irish-americans '' or `` one sixty-eigth swedish '' or `` cherokee '' white dudes . 
  they need to fucking stop . 
  he 's american plain and simple .
