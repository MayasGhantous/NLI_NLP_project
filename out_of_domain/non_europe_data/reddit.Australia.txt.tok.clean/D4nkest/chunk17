  could n't find the original . 
  god i love this voice, 
  fucking normies appropriating [ our ] ( http://boards.4chan.org/fa/ ) insult, 
  he 's been in a weirdly good mood the last few days . 
  check his vods from 3 + days ago and he 's the saltiest dude eu, 
  i have secrets , hammer of wrath and divine favor in my paladin deck just now . 
  maybe it was just a bug at the start ? 
  there are spells now, 
  those are like an order of magnitude more expensive than i thought they 'd be, 
  okay whos taking out the `` th ere '' part of this . 
  it 's honestly the best part and is inifnitely worse without it, 
  [ * i could have done that but i was too smart for school * ] ( / / #atheism ), 
  what even is that rack ? 
  for dips if you have 15 ' wingspan ? 
  a bad idea how ? 
  if you only want to work out three days a week that 's fine even though it 's not optimal, 
  5x15 lateral raises , lighter weight so you can finish all the reps. amazing shoulder pump, 
  no , there 's no such thing as muscle confusion . 
  it 's recommended to switch up every 6 months or something so you do n't get super bored but you could literally do the same thing forever, 
  fitness machines notoriously over-report calories burnt , try eating 2500 and see how you go for a month then raise/lower it depending on your goals, 
  any workout is better than no workout so 3 times a week is way better than nothing . 
  you got it bro, 
  yes , to the side with a slightly bent elbow so it 's not locked . 
  check out this bb.com video : http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/side-lateral-raise, 
  i 'd recommend talking to your doctor about those to make sure they 're safe for you first , and show him a video or diagram of how the movements work . 
  if you know these are safe then that seems good to me, 
  how tall are you and how much do you weigh ? 
  if you 're eating 1600-1800 then that 's good , keep it up and you will see results soon . 
  do n't expect several pounds a week but you 'll get there as long as you track your calories and ignore whatever my fitness pal says for walking or what the treadmill says you 've lost . 
  if you keep at that calorie amount every day you 'll be a new man/woman by january, 
   $ 5 - $ 28 in freedom money for anyone interested, 
  when you try to correct someone but show how ignorant you are, 
  * justamericanthings *, 
  so cute when you 're wrong, 
  i was thinking basshunter, 
  it 's either barth or frostmourne . 
  the other ones are really quiet . 
  go barth as you want horde, 
  okay it 's super low effort but some of the responses just made me laugh at how reddit they were . 
   two adult straight dudes trying to say they like each other and want to hang out again . 
  seriously . 
  maybe i 'm too normie for reddit but really ? 
   telling someone you like them . 
  its a natural desire to be attracted to another human being . 
  people act like its something to be ashamed of . 
  i 'm assuming he 's talking about the high school definition here and so it 's pretty funny he thinks it 's awkward to tell someone that you find them attractive/want to date them, 
   asking my roommate to do basic household chores . 
  lol, 
   accidentally touching your friend 's hand while walking together . 
  this is only awkward if you think it 's awkward , people brush against eachother all the time and it 's relatively normal if it 's not excessive, 
   walking the same speed as someone else, 
  what, 
   buying pads/tampons . 
  like , come on . 
  everyone fucking knows women have their periods . 
  why on earth do i have to feel ashamed when i 'm visibly carrying a pad to a public toilet or at the store . 
  it 's ridiculous , imo . 
  does this actually happen ? 
  everything about this i read on reddit is `` you 're an awesome guy '' from women when males post this garbage, 
   as a grown ass man , talking to children is getting increasingly awkward with age . 
  no , i 'm not trying to kidnap your daughter - she 's just way more entertaining than you and all the other big people . 
  lol, 
   complimenting someone . 
  lol, 
   pooping in public, 
  lol, 
   going to the gym as a fat person, 
  feeling insecure is n't awkward . 
  i was insecure when i started going to the gym too, 
   calling to make an appointment . 
  the people on the other end of the phone always seem confused or flustered . 
  like they 're being bothered . 
  maybe i just get bad doctor offices . 
  lol, 
   may only apply to some of us but pretty much every time i talk to someone it 's fucking awkward . 
  i 'm not cut out for this `` life '' thing . 
  lol, 
   as a guy , working in retail . 
  le oppression face, 
   saying hello as you walk by people . 
  lol, 
  basically i 'm saying almost none of these are actually awkward for normal people . 
  i know people read questions on askreddit and go `` time to go on my soapbox about something slightly related '' but awkward is not the word i 'd use for any of these really, 
  it should be the poop emoji, 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right th ere right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my sel\uff46 i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ) mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20\uff2foo\uff2fo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  jokes on them i do n't go outside, 
  same for me running windows 10 64 bit , latest chrome . 
  seems to be when the window size is smaller than expected . 
  no one got an archive ? 
  but you see , he 's * 14 * and has n't got his stem doctorate yet so obviously he 's a fake attention whore trying to get his dad political attention instead of being a curious kid taking something apart to learn how it works, 
  http://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/v/16552637 around 3:35:00 from the looks of it, 
  is only memes , why you heff to be mad ? 
  jeremy buendia , he won this year, 
  does anyone have any links for ios 8/9 game development tutorials or anything ? 
  i tried a search on this sub but could n't find anything relevant . 
  looking to learn how to build 2d games for iphones . 
  i could try unity again but i 'd prefer something else , and swift looks interesting . 
  i have experience with java , c # and unity if it helps, 
  this coming from a country with four way stop sign intersections ? 
  lmao,
