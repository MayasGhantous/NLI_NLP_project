  the only one on this that got me was `` dilemna . '', 
  curious why i thought it was `` mn '' instead of `` mm . '', 
  i remember being confused about which one was right in the past, 
  edit : wow are so many people bad at geography in that sub, 
  he 's got that chubby hamster face, 
  me too but opposite , 
  i only browse / r/all or specific subs . 
  the hide post shortcut and filters keep me sane, 
  i actually remember most of these post titles because i 've been here so long, 
   australia is hopefully going to become a republic soon , we can sever ties to the uk officially and join the big boy club . 
  but i like her majesty the queen, 
  mate a sausage sizzle is super common way to get some money for a cause, 
   there is no size limit, 
  going off `` kumura '' he is from new zealand so there 's no worries, 
  i do n't think it is . 
  it seems really familiar to the fake unfortunate events teaser, 
  [ americans love pretending they 're anything other than american . 
  is there a single yellow line too ? 
  in australia the single yellow line is no stopping for any reason , white line is no parking . 
  two lines is only ever used in the middle of the road, 
   the related internet cesspools ( i.e. 
  the - chans ) . 
  have you actually been on 4chan ? 
  it 's just like reddit where the mainstream places ( / b / , / v / , / r9k / , / pol / etc. ), 
  are shite but the nicher boards are bretty good ( i like / fit / and / fa / ) . 
  i would buy all the reddit gold for each default sub to implement the most nazi of automod configs for a week and see how much better they could be, 
  ur not funny, 
  why ca n't ramen be protein , i could eat it for every meal . 
  hnng, 
  / pol / is everything bad about reddit in one board, 
  cheers , that 's interesting, 
   thanks . 
  i have to keep re-learning stuff as it changes, 
  do you honestly believe the world is changing around you instead of you learning something wrong ? 
  if there was some force that would change reality why would it fuck with the oxford comma instead of something that actually mattered ? 
   seeing as gamergate ~ ~ started as ~ ~ is cyber bullying it makes sense that they would freak out . 
  at least the op is n't pretending to be left-leaning like the rest of them, 
  the meta symbol from red vs blue by, 
  rooster teeth . 
  you are severely underestimating the cost of gh, 
  went way too fast for me and i did n't gild any buildings or buy a gold boost . 
  every 5-10 minutes i had 1000x angel investors to restart with , and the upgrades were all crazy like x9-999 . 
  wish it went slower because now there 's nothing to do on there but get megabucks, 
  also did n't i read on the update that there would be ways to upgrade the profit martian thing ? 
  i do n't believe there were any upgrades for it, 
  overall feels like there 's half the content of mars missing somehow , like this update was rushed . 
  there 's no money per second managers that show `` $ 445 unquadtrigintillion/s '' etc so you have to guess basically once the buildings are too fast for a countdown which one is the best and there 's no `` buy all '' upgrades button, 
  yeah you get way disproportionate amounts of buildings . 
  i 'm at like 65k dirt and only 2600 of the last building . 
  i did my first reset at ~ 150 angels , then again when it was doubled . 
  i do n't remember the early game much but once you get the final building going you 'll fly through it all . 
  edit : i think the man building is good for the beginning ? 
  also this took me like 3 days once it unlocked to beat it fully with the kongregate mobile bonus and ads bonus whenever i could, 
   but is n't it several hundred miles away, 
  1400 miles away from sydney to auckland, 
  android emojis do n't look great, 
  how did this get 34x more jpeg than like yesterday when this was posted, 
  that was horrible ... what happened to the earlier style ? 
  are n't reports anonymous ? 
  that is the lamest thing i 've ever read on reddit lmao, 
  you do n't even need to do this outside of the early game with the 0.6 update, 
  it 's not about average it 's about being better than everyone else, 
  the background of the thumbnail should be enough to tell you if it 's sfw or nsfw . 
  blue boards like / v / , / fit / etc are sfw and the orange boards are nsfw like / pol / and / b /, 
  i do n't think you understand how tax works, 
  yes but only money above that bracket . 
  if you 're earning say 99,000 at say 30 % tax and 100k + is 50 % tax , and get a side job that gives you an extra 10,000 a year you do not earn 55k that year . 
  your 100,000 gets 30 % taxed ( 70,000 ) and then everything above 100k gets 50 % taxed ( 4500 , for a total of 74,500 ) . 
  it does n't all get 50 % taxed, 
  but it 's still more money overall, 
  it also has the smug aspect of `` we know more than you '' . 
  if the sites own cto has said they reverted the change , they probably reverted the change . 
  is n't the code open source anyway ? 
  i know most of it is but maybe not the algorithms they use for sorting, 
  bonus round : follow the thread to the deleted askreddit thread and see delicious reddit paranoia, 
  edit : all from the undelete thread :, 
   edit : we 're getting close to the front page , let 's streisand effect the shit out of this !, 
  roddit revealing the conspiracy to ... have to wait for people to vote on shit before it reaches the front of / r/all ? 
   holy fuck . 
  instead of getting shit together they just hide it all . 
  sad , very sad . 
  yep askreddit is `` reddit '' and not run by unpaid moderators . 
  reaching / r/conspiracy levels of dumb here, 
   i browse reddit a lot . 
  i saw nothing about oregon on the frontpage . 
  i felt so out of the loop when i found out about it late last night . 
  something is obviously wrong . 
  `` i get to blame my ignorance on reddit and feel good about myself because it 's not my fault : ^ ) '', 
   lol matches are getting front page in 5 minutes tho, 
  oh shit a sub with ** 700,000 ** unique users ** per day ** is faster to upvote stuff they care about ? 
  / r/news only has about 400k users and i doubt most of them browse / new like lol apparently does for current tournaments, 
   but at least reddit conforms to peoples feels, 
  like how you * feel * that reddits front page is different lately ? 
   yup , they want the fake , sponsored , vote manipulatd posts to stay at the top longer so that they are worth more money . 
  does n't reddit get tonnes of publicity every time it `` breaks '' a story ? 
  let 's pretend that does n't happen because fuck the admins !, 
  celebriscum using my website  :(, 
  there was a front page algorithm change ~ 7 weeks ago [ changelog thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3g6ghn/reddit_change_the_scores_of_extremelypopular/ ) but people found it left the front page stagnant with older posts so they removed it over a month ago [ reversal changelog link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3inm1c/reddit_change_the_increase_to_the_soft_cap_on/ ) . 
  redditors still think the original change is in effect and that reddit the company is lying to them for some reason, 
  just a heads up its transgender , not transsexual,
