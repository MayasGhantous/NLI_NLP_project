  so skeletons get rekt by goobers being moronic ? 
  okay kia you sure got us good, 
  i guarantee he could crush your head with his thighs, 
  shitty foods like fried chicken and burgers are n't the worst , you just have to be cautious of the portion size . 
  hopefully they wo n't get offended if you eat half as much as they do, 
  if you do that then they will continue to be disproportionate . 
  i 'd stay the same and soon enough they 'll even out, 
  once you get in to the habit of it , it 's really simple . 
  i 've been 35 days + in a row on mfp now and it 's automatic to put in what i 've just eaten after every meal , or before if it 's dinner and i 'm not sure if it 's enough/too much . 
   `` all pc games run horribly '' argument . 
  at least our horribly is their standard, 
  anal retentive , paying lots of attention to small things and making them right, 
  depends what it is , if it 's say a burger or pasta at a restaurant i 'd go off similar meals i 've made at home . 
  usually i wing it if i ca n't calculate everything in it with the quick add kilojoules , and on the lower side as i 'd rather eat too much than not enough, 
  i dream about this every day ='), 
  right ? 
  that is a wide-ass escalator, 
  it does if hes lifting heavy ass weights hours each day, 
  you still have to work out , steroids do n't magically make you big just by taking them, 
  people use `` genetics '' sarcastically in the bb world to say `` not natty '' . 
  those delts make me lean towards not natty but who knows, 
   why op put effort into getting voat 's paypal suspended ? 
  just because the satire is not for the white man does n't mean it 's not satire . 
  this is hilarious, 
   me thinking : -4 ? 
  that 's not cold ... ow wait , fahrenheit . 
  -4 celsius is cold as fuck dude , especially in australia where it 's rare to get below 5 ( which is also cold as fuck ) . 
  summer highs are ~ 45 for days on end, 
  as for the 3 day versus 5 day , the five day is probably a bro split which is one particular body area per day once a week , say arms monday , legs tuesday , chest wednesday , back thursday , shoulders friday . 
  working out your muscle groups once a week equals little gains . 
  icf on the other hand is full body three times a week and is much more comprehensive and leads to much better gains, 
  way better to hit the muscle groups twice a week , this will be slow af and make you wonder where the gains are . 
  look at coolcicada 's ppl routine , much better, 
  i guarantee if you do a 4/5 day split once a week you will look half as good as you could have if you did a 3 day split twice a week, 
  it 's not a competition , you 're used to cold because you live in cold . 
  i live in hot so cold is exponentially colder for us, 
  thought it 'd be too shitposty so i cropped it when i saw the / fit / thread, 
  wow ~ ~ kia ~ ~ paomustresign ^ ^ \\ ( see ^ ^ below ) brigaded that really hard . 
  i saw it yesterday at +30, 
  i 'm 80 % sure it was kia , i saw a thread linking it on / r/all but i hide everything i see so i find new threads easier and i could n't find it on a quick search . 
  it was definitely brigaded, 
  edit : sorry it seems it 's / r/paomustresign [ thread here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/paomustresign/comments/3ayelc/ellen_pao_respondsagrees_with_redditor_her_only/ ) . 
  the overlap is probably high but i guess kia is off the hook this time,

  no you dont deserve it, 
  glad to see broscience called out , nice job, 
  machines are good for isolation exercises but you still need to do compound lifts with free weights . 
  programs like icf is 40 % free weights mandatory , then a bunch of isolation work that you can use free weights or machines on, 
  looking joocy mate, 
  you can ? 
  there 's a way to open up the weird plaintext of res tags and i assume you can just copy it to others if you can paste into it . 
  it 's how / r/masstagger works, 
  we use cm and kg for height and weight , and cm for waist circumference for australian brands , although most are inches there . 
  the average person knows how tall 6 ' is though and i say i 'm 6 ' 1 because 187cm does n't sound very impressive, 
  yeah pretty much , i blame the yanks, 
  i just wish more people got it right . 
  so many go `` shame * ding * shame * ding * shame * ding * '' or `` shame shame * ding ding * '' . 
  get your memes right reddit reeeeeee, 
  [ hugh has probably the most disproportionate legs ever ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dvlyidw.jpg ), 
  this photo is from at least 2012 . 
  he deadlifted 435 eight months ago so i guess he just looks tiny ? 
  here 's a photo from last week and his legs look skinny af https://instagram.com/p/3-duitchcz,

  step up your reference game srd, 
  by the way if you lift weights i 'd put the cardio afterwards so you have more energy for the important things , lots of people feel more burnt out when they do cardio first, 
  you do n't even look like you 're bulking fat-wise , go hard bro you 're good . 
  ah okay , good luck , 
  calf raises . 
  stand on something like a brick on the tip of your feet and lower down , then stand all the way up on the ball of your foot .

  sometimes i think about the gains from wearing a weighted vest . 
  the guy with the biggest calves i know used to be fat , perpetually jealous . 
   inb4 i get downvote brigaded by srs, 
   +154 points, 
  you have been visitd by the [ glorious gains master ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nzud4ae.jpg ), 
  comment `` thank mr mazzetti '' within ten years and good gains and protein will come to you, 
  good gains and fibre will come to you, 
  ur welcome bot, 
  i wish i could ohp that much, 
  people who lift weights should eat at minimum 0.6 g of protein per pound of bodyweight . 
  60 is maybe okay for sedentary life but who wants to live like that, 
  if you want to get stronger it is a lot better to do 4 sets of 8-12 with much heavier weight than you 're doing now if you can do 100 reps. 90 second rest between each set and you 're good to go . 
     thank mr mazzetti,

  if you think magenta is purple you need your eyes checked or a better monitor . 
  i got 31/31 correct as a man, 
  magenta is pink though . 
  pink and purple are very different, 
  i ask myself this every day, 
  til new guys took over the old inside gaming channel .
