  always put the thing you use back the way you find them . 
   unaware intentionally or unintentionally of the consequences of posting the picture without contacts that it roots from a movement `` black lives matter '' . 
  i do not want that kind of doctor near me . 
   holy shit i would n't like any of those to be my doctor . 
  when it comes to health there is n't any affirmative action, 
   fuck these people . 
  they have special scholarships . 
  special programs . 
  special rules for acceptance into college . 
  special words . 
  special buildings . 
  and when anything goes wrong `` fucking racist white people caused this '' and when nothing goes wrong `` we beat the racist white people '' . 
   good lord i hope they never become my doctor . 
  i do n't need someone who thinks whitey tried to bury them working on me medically . 
  that scares the shit out of me . 
   that 's cool and all , but if my doctor walks in with a gangsta-gait and a hoodie on his head , i 'm never going back to that doctor again . 
  way to fucking remember it 's about the patients , dumbass , not you . 
  congrats , you passed med school . 
  time to remember your hippocratic oath . 
   but why do they got ta look all thuggish like that ? 
   blacks should be doing manual labor and not something that requires higher intelligence like college . 
  good white people are not being accepted to these colleges simply because of their skin color which is disgusting and racist no matter how you look at it . 
  affirmative action is one of the most racist policies in america today . 
   fucking race baiters . 
  go back to somalia if you 're so smart . 
  go help them . 
  we are fine here . 
   i dont want no durty nig practice medicine, 
   instead of being happy or proud of their own achievement , these guys find a way to complain . 
  none of these were upvoted beyond a few points but holy shit . 
  burn reddit down . 
  the way it loads more comments as you scroll is beautiful . 
  i 'd love that on reddit, 
  liberal has two meanings though and the commie subs use it correctly still . 
  the right-wing liberal party in australia is not liberal like americans know the word, 
  did they flair that guy with `` affirmative action nigger '' for arguing against this not being cringey ? 
  ca n't let those darn niggers try to speak up about inequality,

  i 'm playing male consular right now and the voice is perfect amount of blind jedi arrogance and smarmy rule-follower . 
  i love it, 
  i think he meant the va for padme is the one for vette, 
  please keep discussion to reposts of offended white boys, 
   it 's `` you put that much hard and professional work into your accomplishment , and you 're going to behave like that ? '', 
  this is hateful . 
  go away they can do what they want, 
  does anyone have the comic of the guy raging at the nazi and the nazi is all calm and polite saying `` well i was just trying to have a reasonable discussion about killing jews but hey that 's your opinion '' or something like that ? 
  fits this guy lmao, 
  [ this is good ], 
   also , you called them thugs because they were wearing hoodies and not smiling . 
  shit everyone on the bus must think i 'm a ~ ~ nigger ~ ~ thug in winter time, 
   normal people, 
   it seems that a small segment of society is making most of the problem ; but we ca n't talk about it because of political correctness . 
  you 're literally talking about it right now you racist fuck . 
  who is oppressing you ?!, 
  reddit loves racist shit , you 're posting about it on a mainstream sub with hundreds of upvotes . 
  no one is holding you down . 
  redditors are professional fucking victims . 
  edit : this assholes account has been active for just a week and he 's posting seemingly exclusively about how ~ ~ horrible women are , ~ ~ might actually be a woman ? 
  how great guns are and those damn dirty niggers violating muh freedom, 
  thanks !, 
  okay honestly who and how are people `` targeting gamers '' ? 
  with what ? 
  you can still play your video games in your nans basement all day . 
  games are mainstream get over yourself kia you 're not a victimised minority, 
  so i 've just realised jedi knights can wear heavy armor . 
  does that mean i can dress up as a trooper ? 
  and i can dress my trooper up as a jedi ? 
  ah okay i assumed it was like wow 's transmog where it had to be the same armor class . 
  thanks for all the information !, 
  now to spend all my credits on cool outfits, 
  ah i see , it does n't unify the colours of my original gear if i just use a single chest piece on the new outfit . 
  kinda strange but i think i understand how it works now, 
  how am i supposed to shitpost a link to kia if you submit it first and actually type words about it :(, 
   this started out as the `` can i speak to the manager '' starter pack, 
   the ` can i speak to a manager ' haircut, 
   aka the `` bitch bob '' . 
   that haircut gives me anxiety . 
   that 's also both `` my kids are half black '' and `` let me speak to your manager '' haircut . 
   got ta love that ` as a mother ' hair, 
   that 's the oblivious delivery vagina starter kit . 
   the cunt-cap and minivan is a dead giveaway , every time . 
   ah yes the cunt cap makes this 100 % legit . 
   i just knew that this would have the `` let me speak to your manager '' haircut, 
   thats the `` i need to speak to a manager '' starter pack . 
   ah yes , the `` i want to speak to your manager !! '', 
  haircut ... 
   check out , it 's the `` as a mother '' haircut . 
  what the fuck is reddits obsession with hating mothers and this fucking meme haircut, 
  real talk do redditors even read outside of high school ? 
  so many high school english books in there, 
  does anyone else get visual glitches all the time ? 
  running borderless windowed mode at 1440p with the recommended geforce experience settings for my 680 on windows 10 and i get sooo many visual bugs . 
  like every 15 minutes there 's something new that 's glitchy . 
  from terrain bugs like floating grass , to a black ceiling , to big ass ground textured walls in the near distance . 
  or characters not putting their weapons away in cutscenes like the jedi masters accidentally stabbing themselves because they 've crossed their arms with their lightsaber still in their hand and have it going through them , or characters walking in cutscenes and they do n't stop where they 're supposed to and just keep walking through characters and walls . 
  or teleporting characters in cutscenes . 
  or the rocket boots making the character run really fast half the time instead of staying hover boots the entire 12 seconds . 
  or a random glitched object looking like a fifth dimensional being is invading instead of being a box or something . 
  either my graphics card is dying or something 's fucky .
