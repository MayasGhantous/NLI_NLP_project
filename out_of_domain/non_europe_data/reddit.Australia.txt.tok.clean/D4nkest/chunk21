  i 've never experienced this level of graphical glitches from a aaa game, 
  edit : just now the walls of a cave are n't loading and i can see the abyss . 
  so confused, 
   if these guys could spend at least a fraction of this energy they waste on viscerally hating all women and patting themselves on the backs for it ... how much could they accomplish ? 
  i hear they can take over new zealand with all their fit able bodied men :\\ ^ ), 
  [ did you guys see this ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/3ocs59/srs_openly_brigades_subreddits_with_no/ ) so much ass hurt over imagined srs brigading when * they are the ones brigading srs * . 
  you ca n't even make it up they 're as dumb as dog shit . 
  they 're hysterical going on about how le srs = admins and that srs linking threads is apparently brigading although for years now the admins have said srs does n't brigade despite linking threads being the basis of the sub . 
  they 're spamming username mentions of the admins and archiving everything as if srs is trying to hide it or something, 
   note how all their mods hide behind alts so that their actions as mod can not be traced back to their online persona . 
  and of course this is never considered to be an attempt to bypass bans , no sir !, 
  maybe they use different accounts so you weebs do n't doxx them . 
  we all know how violent kia can get towards the evil skeletons, 
   social justice can , just not being a skeleton . 
   the idea of equality is good , being an asshole and doxing and sending threats is not . 
  this coming from a gamergator . 
  i think i just died of irony, 
  why did they defile brd with a gross redditor dick ? 
  hint for the kia nerds : fempire . 
  female empire . 
  no gross dicks pls, 
  they did it for free, 
  it 's saying it wo n't let me repair it unless it detects something 's wrong with the patch, 
   feminists , anti-militarists , minority victimizers , refugee supporters , and raging socialists dominate the student body . 
  it 's becoming almost weird to be a normal person nowadays . 
   * it 's becoming almost weird to be a normal person nowadays . 
  it 's disturbing that they think being a racist fuckwit is normal . 
  why on earth is he posting on a racist european sub if he 's a yank anyway ? 
  redditors sure love calling women cunts . 
  does the friendzone even exist any more ? 
  i thought the term died out a couple years ago when we realised it was just a way to describe males who fell in love with their women friends and never asked them out, 
  thanks . 
  i 'm not sure if it did anything but i also updated my graphics driver so hopefully it 's better now , 
  this is what redditors actually believe . 
  referring to the original may may post itself, 
  kripp has acknowledged subs now for months . 
  it 's terrible, 
  so redditors shit all over huffpo until it supports their views ? 
  lmao, 
   price it exponentially higher than the cost to produce because of their brand value , and many people will pay out of pocket for it even when they do n't need a new phone . 
  this is business tho . 
  if millions of people buy it , it 's the right price . 
  holy shit a [ le ] gem in the rough . 
  the rest of that thread is complete garbage, 
  there 's an entire sub of these dorks at / r/lostgeneration, 
  and the boomers are the self-entitled ones apparently . 
  god damn, 
  [ * have you heard what my penis thinks yet ? 
   i 'd punch a fucking wall with my tear drenched fist if this man kicks the bucket . 
  why are males so violent, 
  i 'm on the opposite side of this . 
  i love / r/ignorantimgur and how imgurians know nothing about the greater leddit/chan/internet culture, 
  [ it spread from imgur though ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banana-for-scale ) , so it does make sense to see it as le ebin imgur may-may, 
   a : you like burnie ? 
   b : yup, 
   a : cool, 
  what else is there to talk about with him lmao, 
  just leveling characters as i do n't want to learn end-game this close to an expansion . 
  started two weeks ago and i 've got 6 level 50-52s right now, 
  reddit is conservative, 
  and womens rights , and transgender rights , and immigration ... basically every major conservative point, 
  i ca n't tell if this is serious or not, 
  yes, 
  http://np.reddit.com or http://www.reddit.com, 
  you ca n't do http://www.np.reddit.com or http://np.www.reddit.com it does n't work like that, 
  they mention that was before they had planetary shielding in one of the storylines, 
  mods of / r/polandball are pretty garbage for trying to keep their 177k clubhouse some kind of secret , and the flair on every post reeks of this weird krautchan superiority for their dank meme . 
  if every post is `` redditormade '' , then the flair is unnecessary . 
  idk it grinds my gears, 
  can i get a definition ? 
   [ giant wall of / r/thathappened ], 
   thank odin i 'm gay, 
  what 's with internet weebs and their obsession with `` brodin '' and norse mythology, 
  edit : reading mra 's thoughts on rape victims is just sad and kinda gross [ . 
   what in gods name are you going on about . 
  literally none of this conversation was about srs or skeletons . 
  seriously , what 's this have to do with the conversation other than you being a crazy kid who thinks skeletons are taking over the site ? 
  praise be, 
  it 's illegal to park like that where i live so it was weird seeing that haha, 
  so if you bought thexan 's armor and used it you could have it on all your characters ? 
  that 's pretty cool, 
  lmao the downvoted comments are basically the same as the top level comments but apparently you have to be subtle for your bigotry to be upvoted on r/tinder, 
  he got called a skeleton for that . 
  kia is fucking bizarro reddit, 
  feels over reals for kia apparently, 
  * i 'm not racist but those niggers make me uncomfortable whenever i see one so i go out of my way to avoid them . 
  * - reddit `` left leaners '', 
  saw-tor or riot . 
  glad you 're getting back into it !, 
   but simply having an active subscription and supporting the game as a whole should earn you early access regardless . 
  i mean you get it for `` free '' and sor so that 's your sub bonus, 
  [ do we know what she was doing while thexan and arcann were wrecking the sith and republic ? 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  can you unbind the spacebar to skip dialog ? 
  i could n't find it in keybinds, 
  light side warrior  light side knight  dark side knight  dark side warrior . 
  you can easily do both or all four if you want though . 
  i 've done 3 out of 4 so far and it only takes a few days to go through the story on each character, 
  this is wrong as well .
