  is it just a limitation of them mostly being one panel ? 
  yes but * why * ? 
  my art teacher at school would 've failed me if i had to put a label stating what something was instead of redoing it until i could show it . 
  i do n't know anything about political cartoons so i 'm just curious, 
  if you 're 53 i 'd do the intro to sor flashpoints/questline as they got me from 53 to 58ish with a major xp boost in an hour or two, 
  this person needs to look up what leftist and progressive actually mean . 
  wow, 
  your post history is literal garbage get out, 
  good post, 
  why does it bother you so much that they do it ? 
  i think once australia or some other team turned their backs to it and got a lot of shit for that which was pretty funny and there 's nothing better than two opposing haka 's with the pacific island teams, 
  now i feel bad for killing him, 
  this is all sorts of wrong . 
  it 's a cheat day in the sense that it 's not following his usual diet and usually has more calories than he would otherwise have . 
  it has no effect on your body like you imply, 
  nothing about consular 's not getting zenith after balmorra or whatever or was that fixed in 4.0.1 ? 
  what i do n't understand is if reddit was run by tumblr feminazis why is it still trash ? 
  i wish srs actually were the admins because then reddit could actually be good, 
  dear god that knight set is hideous, 
  you know fallout 3 and new vegas had a bunch of dlc right ? 
  nothing about it looks `` jedi '' to me and the armor plates look ridiculous but at least it has pants so it 's not all bad, 
  lol you can get banned from any sub for any reason , they do n't owe you shit . 
  i loved it when kia weebs got upset about `` general white people nonsense '' as one of the report options, 
  is this a serious post ? 
  who is criticizing / r/atheism outside of saying they 're fedoralord 14 year olds ? 
  also til / r/atheism is still a sub people post in or care about, 
  maybe above average over all games , but out of aaa releases it is average, 
  why does he have a mint lightsaber here ? 
  i have n't read the book, 
  school is reception/transition for the first year then it 's year 1 through 12 in australia . 
  r/t to year 7 is primary school then year 8 to 12 is high school although some schools also have a middle school which is years 6-9, 
  cool , i 've always loved the mint green, 
  reception/transition , depending on which area you are it 's called something different . 
  up north it 's called transition but down south-east it seems it 's only reception . 
  edit : sorry you mean what it is actually not just the initialism . 
  it 's the year between preschool/kindergarten and actual school . 
  it 's technically the first year of proper school whereas preschool/kindergarten is optional and mostly just a day-care for the kids, 
  it 's not racist get over yourself, 
  to add on to what the other people said , you can put a name in yourself so it could be `` d4nkest '' instead if anonymous but this is looked down upon as attention seeking and `` namefagging '', 
  do people want korra to be anime ? 
  nothing about it seemed weeb to me, 
  hah look at this normie with * friends * ^ ^ ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ lonely, 
  edgy, 
  this is too real i need some time to think about this, 
   feminism is the idea that we can make both sexes equal by focusing solely on the issues of one of them . 
  do redditors know anything outside of what they parrot to eachother ? 
  this is the renaissance of travolta , it was big a year or so ago . 
  memes are a circle, 
  she features quite a bit in swtor and its expansions as grandmaster of the jedi order, 
  us has more people per capita / s, 
  nope my cat was killing birds until we got her a bell collar, 
  if it takes you 3-4 hours to do a 3 minute intro for one of the games you played on stream then i do n't know what to tell you, 
  `` also , buy an e-ticket to try our new tournament gamemodes and tune in to our tournaments :\\ ^ ) '', 
  i think straya is bedmas , us is pemdas and according to below uk has bodmas/bidmas, 
  object oriented programming is a style of programming , not a language itself . 
  i ca n't answer your question sadly . 
  may i ask how you got this job without knowing what it requires ? 
  they could just stop going to the gym for a year or three and lay off the steroids but they would still have manly features such as broader shoulders and straight waist etc, 
  there are turrets in star fortresses ? 
  i hate it because i hate that redditors are so horny they must involve their peen in everything . 
  they could n't just upvote a cool thing , they have to upvote and then comment about how much they want to fuck the ~ ~ woman ~ ~ female and then congratulate themselves over upvoting something that is both peen-pleasing and cool, 
  yeah it 's a palette, 
  does kia actually believe they represent all gamers ? 
  all hundreds of millions of gamers ? 
  sorry but you 've violated the [ official guide on how to criticise / r/atheism ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3sxp38/fyi_how_to_criticize_ratheism ) and have now been banned :\\ ^ ), 
  introvert does n't mean asocial, 
   people who like `` ifls '' usually do n't love science , they just like to think they 're enlightened and above the common plebs . 
  they just like the ` science memes ' that anyone would find interesting , not the actual , boring science that people need to know to make new , interesting discoveries . 
  reddit is exactly the same, 
  hey the worlds not just yurop and murica :(, 
   & gt ; and there were just as many incompetent white males that applied for the job and were n't qualified for it either . 
   i bet those incompetent white males also did n't get special treatment and have the physical they could n't pass ignored . 
   those incompetent white males did n't get special treatment, 
   white males, 
   did n't get special treatment, 
  hehhheheheheh, 
  well it 's monday for me but sure [ let 's do it !, 
   what is your preferred way of describing a thing or situation that is pretty good ? 
  no `` heaps good '' ? 
  is / r/runescape really that bad, 
  someone unironically thinks srs is `` close enough '' to stormfront in the depths of that thread . 
  lmbo, 
  i will never understand reddit 's obsession with letting everyone know that they jerked off to some picture . 
  why do they think anyone cares !, 
  i love the complete lack of self-awareness about all these internet polls saying how amazing burnie is . 
  like the poll after that debate a few weeks ( ? ), 
  ago where most actual people thought hilary won but then the burniebots brigaded all the polls and then were like `` muh cnn censorshipping because they had an article saying hilary won but celarly we won because we brigaded the polls and burnie is literally ron paul reincarnated as jesus . '', 
  it even became a big thread in / r/conspiracy that all the news sites were `` wrong '' about hilary winning and they were trying to keep burnie down with their evil agenda because well the internet polls said burnie won . 
  he controls the memes of production so he must be a socialist, 
   influx, 
  you must be new here . 
  communism is the only path comrade, 
  wow their lord and saviour is a bigger piece of shit than i thought , and that 's saying something, 
  / r/fullcommunism because you know they 'd be cool , have a sense of humour and have a good idea of politics, 
  at-at 's are really durable though as seen in rebels season 2 where their clone wars era tank ( at-te ) did no damage to the armoring of the at-at 's with the main cannon except for the one weak spot, 
  i disagree . 
  a tank blaster bolt is way more energy so for it to just fizzle and do nothing i do n't think a warthog strafe run will do anything either . 
  at-at 's are n't even that long so it could smack a couple hundred bullets along it but then after half a second the plane has already gone past it . 
  they 're good at tearing up unarmored ground forces and current technology armor but they would be for instance ineffective against a bunker which the at-at 's armor is even better than, 
  but it grew in size and broke half the house,
