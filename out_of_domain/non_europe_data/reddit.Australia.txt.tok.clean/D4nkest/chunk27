  reddit really has no idea what clickbait is, 
  thanks for reminding me jerk, 
  and it 's such a low bar to pass too, 
  are n't political cartoons the political cartoons of today ? 
  they still make them, 
   being a victim is so great , i wish i could be a victim [ +62 ], 
  yep turns out some subs do n't want edgelords bringing their shit into their subs so they pre-emptively ban kia . 
  pretty smart imo, 
  state capitalism is not communism, 
  stop trying to make that a thing, 
  that is the most active panda i 've ever seen . 
  the ones at the zoo here just sit around doing nothing all day, 
  also [ shit like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0v8b3oq.jpg ) for ~ ~ assaulting ~ ~ liberating pedestrians, 
  who even has a porn collection ? 
  what is this 1995, 
  it 's northern territory , not north australia, 
  simply un-australian, 
  wow people still post there . 
  i thought it died out after kia and subredditcancer came about, 
  achievement hunter is allergic to saying the words `` sponsored '' in a video . 
  thought jack was going to say it for once at the `` we have to mention '' part but nope . 
  `` ubisoft was nice enough to bring us out here to make this video '' is not good enough , you need to explicitly state it is sponsored . 
  because [ they have to ] ( https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/broadcast/sponsid.html ) , i think that 's the right link . 
  funhaus is great at it, 
  that 's up for the fcc to decide . 
  i 've read before that they must clearly state it for people who just listen to it/have it on another monitor as they do something else , so it makes sense to have to state it in the beginning on top of an annotation ( which they only do because they never say `` this is sponsored '' explicitly ) and the description ( which is also part of stating something is sponsored ) . 
  channels that disclose sponsorship well even have '' [ sponsored ] '' in the title . 
  the fact that ah continually tries to sneak around the rules makes it feel scummy , like they 're ashamed or think people wo n't watch it if they find out it 's sponsored, 
   i seriously do n't come to reddit to see my fucking facebook feed . 
    jesus where do you live ? 
  i find the stuff on this sub hilarious but if people i knew in real life posted/thought shit like that ... damn [ +48 ], 
  i got bad news for you buddy , everyone in that sub thinks like that, 
  they 're modeled to look like racing car chairs though ( not sure which kind ) which is why the brand is called that to begin with, 
   they changed their way of comunicating sponsored content some months ago, 
  have they ? 
  it seems the same in this video as it used to be . 
  i did report it to the fcc so we 'll see, 
  how much did this end up costing you ? 
  is n't that what the outrage culture is ? 
  kia and the like ? 
  til netflix has user reviews outside of the 1-5 star rating . 
  and gross, 
  so you have no idea what toxic masculinity is . 
  why does n't that surprise anyone, 
  their reasoning for always carrying several knives is so flimsy it hurts, 
   it 's almost as if they are fighting to protect something nobody is threatening to take away . 
  this describes a certain demographic of reddit perfectly, 
  `` liberal here , [ conservative fart noises ] '', 
  in-engine is not the same as in-game but yes, 
  yeah sure i have one myself sometimes in my bag but they carry proper flip knives ( or whatever they 're called ) for no reason, 
  edit : like [ this hero ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vfxuz6l.jpg ) . 
  two knives , one of them pretty big , for a 17 year old student . 
  what the fuck, 
  this was me this morning . 
  life 's not fair, 
  lol, 
  this is what racists actually believe, 
  you have no idea what communism is, 
  you have no idea what socialism is, 
  if it 's still a capitalist economy it will never be socialism by definition, 
  the alien is a skin-color hack that ios uses ( it appends a second character to the emoji to modify the skin color ) that shows up as an alien if you do n't have ios 9 or you have a non-apple device, 
  sounds like racist apologia to me matey, 
  one of the cms said this in response to deck slots ( i believe ) a month or three ago, 
  fuck off i 'm $ 50/month in radelaide :(, 
  that 's a great deal . 
  live the dream for us up north, 
  it 's just an index finger pointing emoji if you look closer, 
  ah my mistake , unicode uses it in a hacky way . 
  thanks, 
  someone was arguing yesterday that `` brogressive '' was man-shaming lol, 
   my favorite part of having based trump elected will be the reaction from skeletons who will be oblivious that so many people voted for him in reaction to their skeleton bullshit . 
  [ mfw reactionaries think anyone outside of their outrage safe space care about skeletons ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8v2y3da.jpg ), 
   fight back gamers !, 
  but we 're gamers too, 
  right ? 
  texas does n't even break into the top 5 biggest states of australia . 
  i thought it would be way bigger by how often they jerk eachother off about the size, 
  [ look how cute it is ] ( http://mapfight.appspot.com/au-vs-texas/australia-texas-us-size-comparison ) . 
  but yeah contiguous usa is like 400,000 km ^ 2 bigger than australia, 
  [ meanwhile in the motherland ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6te85ku.jpg ), 
  almost definitely means the fizzy soft drink lemonade, 
  in australia we have sprite which is lemonade but no orange equivalent . 
  we have solo ( a lemon soft drink ) and fanta ( an orange soft drink ) but they 're not like lemonade at all, 
  how did chicago manage to ruin both pizza and hotdogs ? 
  til of san marino . 
  it 's smaller than my local council area, 
  well i mean everyone 's heard of the vatican but i 'm ignorant of some parts of europe like san marino haha, 
  hmm for me it seems pretty small because it 's smaller than most of the states in australia and i 'm used to actually big states so to see texas about half the size of northern territory but to constantly hear how big it is is kind of odd as i consider western australia to be `` big '', 
  that is actually surprisingly helpful for a foreigner , thanks, 
  but the lemon equivalent is n't lemonade , it 's solo i 'd say, 
  m8 have you been to the north-east ? 
  hilly as fuck . 
  i thought you were talking about another city at first, 
  and because glorious motherland engineering shits all over puny capitalist space shuttles, 
  i tried but then it was like `` no u must use np links '' and it was too much effort to resubmit, 
  you set me up to fail :(,
