  is it one of those `` pretty girls '' subs ? 
  what 's the context for this rule ? 
  or maybe i do n't want to know, 
   and how it 's influenced contemporary art . 
  they still think it 's called `` modern art '' so i do n't think they 've even taken a single art class, 
  most of it is not ironic, 
  creeps taking photos of women in public without their consent , at the pool/beach/shops / etc and sharing them with reddit as porn/jerk off material . 
  / r/creepshots got taken down so they renamed it / r/candidfashionpolice under the guise of `` critiquing their fashion '' but the titles would be dumb crap like `` i do n't think those can be called shorts any more '' with a photo of some woman in tiny jean shorts at the beach . 
  really gross , really creepy and no way of verifying the age of the people in the creep shots . 
  all around disgusting sub, 
  oh god that sticky, 
   i frequently see comments in this subreddit and similar subreddits about girls being * `` too young '' * or * `` under-age '' * . 
  the sub is x , not r/girlsiwanttohavesexwith . 
  most people are more than capable of admiring someone 's beauty without wanting to have sex with them , the same way they can admire the beauty of a sunset or a flower . 
  just because the beautiful thing is a person , does n't mean your admiration has to be sexual . 
  the subreddit descriptions specifically says it 's * `` for people who can appreciate female beauty without being a perv about it . 
   people can be beautiful at any age . 
  the age limit for posts in this subreddit is 13 , and the only reason for having a limit at all is because of privacy concerns of the girls and because i do n't want this to become a `` look at my cute kids '' subreddit . 
   from now on i will be deleting comments about girls being under-age and referring the commenter to this post . 
  luckily i did n't see anyone that seemed underage after a little look, 
  original trilogy stormtroopers were n't even clones as well though, 
  i think it 's when users here comment in the linked threads and get caught the mods give them comic sans , but that was like at least a year ago so idk if they still do it, 
  it used to be a lot more common , like several comic sans in a thread , which is why i 'm not sure if they do it any more, 
  it is criticism as it implies it has all the faults of a dynasty warriors genre game , namely shallow gameplay/repetitive enemies/etc, 
  there is no way this is n't a joke . 
  people in this sub are oblivious, 
  if she was harassed because she was perceived as a feminist skeleton then yes it was about her gender . 
   well srs got linked , looks like this thread is about to come to an abrupt and painful end :\\ [ +3 ], 
  except this never happens, 
  if you harrass someone for being feminist , you 're probably a misogynist tho, 
  no , he was carried on a stretcher to the medical facility on the resistance planet and they mentioned he had a pulse, 
  i miss kevin, 
  [ ] ( / pleased ), 
  what did they ban you for ? 
   merry christmas everyone !!!, 
  stop being so sensitive  [ +328 , top comment ], 
  is this satire or, 
  do people not like gghazi ? 
  it seems the like equal and opposite sub of kia but with spooky skeletons instead of reactionaries . 
  i like it although i do n't think i 've ever commented there, 
  it seems to have evolved to be a general skeleton media sub so maybe they agree with you, 
  i think all alcohol advertising in australia has to have `` drink responsibly '' on it somewhere noticeable, 
  harvey dent has gone digital, 
   understand my position , i know nothing of art , i draw stick figures , and i get messages on facebook that tell me how his work has all these different qualities which i still do n't understand because again . . 
  i know nothing of art . 
  so i slip the picture on reddit expecting maybe 50-60 upvotes with people telling me it 's nice . 
  i get torches and pitchforks and now it 's 5:15 am and i ca n't sleep and i have to be awake when my son gets back from the grandparents in 3 hours . 
  then make him pancakes and take him to see star wars and also help him finish making christmas presents . 
  i have a long day ahead of me and peoples reaction over this fucking painting have literally ruined my god damn christmas . 
  fuck you reddit . 
  op posted that . 
  why ca n't reddit just let people be happy ? 
  even if it 's bullshit they way overreacted, 
  it 's not a joke . 
  why does everyone think it 's a joke !, 
  got ta love the ever changing number of people communists allegedly murdered . 
  one week it 's 10 million , the next 70 million , then 150 million . 
  what next , 34 billion ? 
  mods are politburo confirmed, 
  / r/murica is dumb, 
  a very white antisemitic burrito, 
  in what world is 40 dust better than a new card back ? 
  i 'll take card backs from brawls every week over 40 dust, 
  i still think i 'd prefer a unique card back over 40 dust you can get from anywhere else at any other time, 
  you 're allowed to criticize the bad parts of a thing you like friend :\\ ^ ), 
  did this happen any other year ? 
  i do n't remember anyone actually caring about this on reddit before . 
  it 's almost parody that they 're trotting out the `` you mean merry christmas , not happy holidays '' like you 're someone 's republican uncle unironically . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ 2015 . 
  reddit , where you 're a pc beta cuck skellington fake gamer girl if you choose to be inclusive :') . 
  that 's the christmas spirit, 
   super politically correct, 
   saying `` happy holidays ! '', 
  instead of `` merry christmas '', 
    the whole point is to get attention, 
   which is exactly why [ free speech zones ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ixtft47.jpg ) were created . 
  they put people out of the way and behind a fence . 
  no need to ban protest or `` free speech '' , when you can just put them behind chicken-wire fencing so they look like caged criminals and the message is overshadowed by the noise of traffic . 
  `` oh no a protest to draw attention to black people ? 
  why ca n't they just keep in their little corner so i do n't have to notice them or acknowledge a problem that does n't effect me . '', 
  lmao . 
  i bet if usa banned video games they 'd be out in the streets doing worse than inconveniencing a few white people for a couple hours, 
  watch it , i 'm jerking here, 
  jokes on them i was n't getting laid before becoming a pc skeleton cuck either, 
  why did we stop at cultural marxism anyway ? 
  we need to go full revolutionary , full marxism comrades, 
  you know it can be staggered right ? 
  so some would work 7-3 then another crew would work 3-9, 
  abolish public holidays , let people take days off when they want to, 
  i do n't think i 've ever had vegetarian mashed potatoes , there 's always milk . 
  do most people just use water/nothing to mash them with ? 
  why is your property worth more than someone else 's life ? 
  vault 81 was so weird . 
  spoilers for completing vault 81 : [ they constantly mention working all the time when you first get there even saying it 's something recent and potentially something behind the vault but i never found any quest to help them out with that , just the quest where you find out the experiment of the vault and get the cure . 
  it felt very unfinished , so i hope i just missed a quest somewhere but i talked to every single npc in there and got nothing . 
  do i have to go to another location or is that it ?

  if your height starts with 5 ' then you 're a manlet, 
  do you know what the definition of manlet is ? 
  it 's always been 6 ' + as the ubermensch , 6 ' as king of manlets and manlets below that height,
