  yes i would because its still art, 
  why are you so prescriptive about it lol ? 
  yes making an axe can be art . 
  almost anything can be art . 
  what makes it not art any more if it 's practical too ? 
  is a handmade custom designed wood axe not art the moment you start using it to cut wood ? 
  this is the most liberal bullshit i 've ever read . 
  why do people try to criticise something they do n't know anything about, 
  they are, 
  congratulations , you played yourself, 
  transphobia should be banned tho, 
  we have no ozone layer above us so shit 's fucked if you 're out in the sun for long , more than any other country . 
  it 's not all about us being pasty, 
  i feel like yanks who say that have never heard the perth bogan accent, 
  in what universe is milo `` fake game boi '' oesophagus , effective . 
  they still think people outside of their little bubble care, 
  it 's bape, 
  he said he used to when he was younger , and admitted it was dumb as fuck, 
  i mean kripp can be boring as shit too with his eating for half an hour muted . 
  i used to watch massan last year when he was the only one on at night for australia so there are some viewers that are real but i agree that most of them are now mrdestructoid, 
  why is burgers in quotes ? 
  looks like they sell burgers to me, 
  its still a burger even if you disagree with whats inbetween the buns, 
  it 's season 1 , episode 12 about 10-11 minutes in to the episode when frank agrees to travel to see raymond tusk about the vice presidency, 
  not in australia, 
  not american but i dont think he has any chance at all . 
  dude looks like he 'll have a heart attack if he has to face any stressful decision at all or your crazy old uncle and america is so far right that bernies `` leftism '' is crazy for the majority of voters . 
  hoping for fullcommunist revolution but ill begrudgingly settle for a democrat again, 
  frist of all how ** dare ** yo u, 
  red square is a club on hindley street . 
  you should be glad you missed it, 
  the white jps are my daily beaters . 
  i love them , on my second pair now and are great to create some contrast with black jeans or go with any shorts . 
  if you can find the older model with the recessed smile instead of painted/stuck on its better quality but theyre rarer now, 
  djkhaled305 , dont play yourself, 
  they do n't want me to have money , so we gon prove they wrong, 
   he is like the only person to stream in most of north americas midnight-8 am or something ? 
  this is the same thing with massan , or at least it used to be late 2014-early 2015 i have n't watched since . 
  massan was the only person to watch just like kripp was the only person to watch in his timeslot . 
  it 's not a mediocre timeslot because you 're not there to see him . 
  i 'm not defending him really , but he really is/was the only person to watch for afternoon in europe and later at night in australia, 
   boil chicken breast, 
  i 'd rather eat it raw, 
   the private businesses are actually a good thing, 
  what are you doing here ? 
  actually hes good now, 
   they 're worried about it failing the same way it always does , and leading to mass slaughter , famine , and deprivation , as it always does . 
   i 'm not a fan of banning political parties or ideas though . 
  seems like something the commies would do . 
  edgy, 
  is there even anything here like that ? 
  there is on average more than one mass shooting ** every day ** in america . 
  that is absolutely disgusting, 
   and appear to be leaner year round , at least at the pro level . 
  that 's because they 're only 160 pounds on a good day, 
  a mass shooting is any shooting involving 4 or more victims/injured . 
  there are these daily . 
  keep moving the goalposts . 
  you ca n't take out all the gun deaths and then pretend there 's no gun deaths, 
  mods here are garbage and delete more than half the content here because it does n't fit their dumb as fuck definition of what bodybuilding is, 
  yes, 
  `` in history '' does n't mean a whole lot when televisions have only existed for like 60 years, 
  we are nazis so its deutsche here . 
  rly though i think the mods can set the language for the sub and its a joke, 
  australia is not a continent, 
  its oceania m8, 
  facts are n't biased . 
  mass shooting on average every day , like i said ? 
  i was born and have lived in australia my whole life and was taught in public and private school that the continent is oceania, 
  russia was never a communist state as there is no state in communism, 
  those other discussions ... gulag for half of r/canada, 
   all rights abandoned, 
  hehehehehe, 
  never, 
  popcorn is pretty decent but any butter or oil brings the calories up tonnes and it 's not very filling, 
  an entire dominos pizza in australia is 1000-1500 spending on what toppings you get and who still drinks non diet soft drinks, 
  maybe it 's because they stopped doing sizes here so there 's only one size but a pepperoni in australia is [ 1230 calories for the whole thing ] ( https://www.dominos.com.au/menu ) . 
  i wonder how big one of yours is god damn it, 
  i do n't mind it as i can have five pieces for dinner and it fills me up so i can have the other three for lunch and still be cutting . 
  god bless america though , bigger and cheaper haha, 
  so what does rich do in between his early morning wake up and cardio , and his gym at 6pm ? 
  why does he have to stay up to 3am editing if he has like 10 hours free during the day, 
  that 's a bullshit quote, 
   this is the thing that gets me . 
  if racism in the u.s. was half as bad as blm claims , where 's the violence ? 
  would n't it be ridiculously easy for one of these white supremacists to sling a rifle , set up a block or two away from a group of protesters , and take a shot ? 
  what the fuck is this ignorant bullshit ? 
  so there 's no violence against black people if they 're not literally being shot to death by white supremacists ? 
  i guess racism is over because black people are n't being gunned down in the streets by white people . 
  you 're mistaking private property and personal property . 
  no one is going after your wardrobe, 
  liberty prime doesnt even know what communism is based off of his quotes in fallout 4, 
  white dudes do n't take blm seriously because they 're racist . 
  eat the bourgeoisie, 
  it 's time to admit that capitalism has failed . 
   companies are not a charity . 
  why should they pay a worker for doing nothing ? 
  they pay the owner for doing nothing though :\\ ^ ), 
  anything under 6 ' is too short tbh, 
  so is that how you pronounce bolognese/carbonara ( from a few days ago ) in america or is rich being rich ?
