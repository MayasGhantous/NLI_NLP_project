   the user base and mod team are * actually * left-wing so you 'd expect them to overlap with communists and such . 
  ftfy, 
  ( actually the worse version of / r/me _ irl ), 
  if you could get paid for how depressed you are i would become a part of the 1 %, 
   although you have to realize that 90 % of the people who make racist , sexist , etc comments on 4chan do n't actually hold those opinions . 
  this is a bit naive and has n't been true for a long time, 
  fuck [ slur ] get money means to stop caring so much about women and focus on your career/making money . 
  that 's why le gentlesir variant is `` disregard women , acquire currency '', 
  is this true ? 
  my cat is immortal then as she has always done this, 
  this is what bernie bros actually believe, 
  nah bernie bros are the ones who will go conservative when bernie does n't get the nomination, 
  bernie bro is not gendered, 
  it 's like you 're trying to miss the point . 
  you can be a `` bernie bro '' without identifying as a man, 
  bernie broism is a way of thinking and is n't tied to gender . 
  i am not saying you are or are not female , it 's just simply you do n't have to identify as a man to subscribe to bernie bro ideology . 
  labels are important . 
  bernie bros are a specific kind of bernie supporter which is itself a label . 
  yeah ... gon na need some vocaroo links there mate, 
  good post, 
  we need to end memes, 
  he 's too over-dramatic/over-energetic to the point where it 's like you wonder if he 's really dead inside, 
  you 're actually supposed to pronounce the h in historic so nah, 
  i think this is why i have two balances on my bank app , my actual balance after pending transactions and the stated balance, 
  hamburger hamburger new york first amendment texas, 
  it 's also used ironically by people making fun of conspiracy theorists, 
  well lads it took me two months to get used to 1500 calories a day , but it can happen where you 're not hungry all the time . 
  coffee when i wake up , small lunch , gym , coffee in mid-late afternoon trying to hold off dinner as long as possible then dinner around 7-10 depending on how hungry i am . 
  down 12 pounds in ~ 10 weeks and i 'm going until at least the end of the month then it 'll be autumn aka bulkin ' season after a couple weeks of slowly building the calories up for a lean bulk all winter long . 
  we 're gon na make it ^ ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ natty ^ ^ ^ ^ life, 
  how do you unironically think you 're not far-right when you post to srssucks lmbo, 
  this is why you get called brogressive kia . 
  christ, 
  what is with all the bernie squad shit in their flairs ? 
  lmao, 
  what do they even do though ? 
  a bernie squad sounds like a reddit meetup where they shill for sanders for free to random passersby, 
  it 's not . 
  i was fucking around with the diet to begin with and stalled for like three-four weeks but now i 've got it down pat, 
  this is some prime shitliberalssay . 
  do n't try to argue something you do n't know anything about, 
   the guy on the right earned it though , by eating other peoples cookies and saving their own . 
  the left and middle one would have more if they did the same , but they 're too busy eating their own cookies , being too lazy or stupid to do it any other way . 
   conservative socialists . 
  this means nothing, 
  literally the opposite . 
  this is capitalism.gif, 
  those comments are pure ideology, 
  there 's an app that uncovers a fog of war over the world based on your gps position but i ca n't find the name of it . 
  i know they mentioned it on some of the roosterteeth podcasts as burnie and gus or gavin had a competition about uncovering the most, 
  and of course they trot out the same old tired references to the snl skit about him . 
  reddit humor is so boring it 's not even humor , it 's just `` hey remember that actually funny thing ? 
  good times '', 
  no , being a girl does like the woman in the picture, 
  its over, 
  it was like $ 6 for 16 egg white carton ( rich uses 10 per shake , 35g protein total ) at my local supermarket so i had to let rich down , i 'm the 95 %, 
  this subs mods are fucking horrible, 
   `` ok i get it reddit hates republicans . 
  someone has n't been paying attention to the `` if not bernie then trump '' crowd, 
  they have a very narrow definition of what bodybuilding and bodybuilding relevant posts are and it 's very different to what the users consider bodybuilding relevant posts . 
  they constantly delete anything that is n't an instagram picture or video of someone working out to the point where there 's only like 3-4 posts a day sometimes as all the actually good threads get deleted . 
  i understand deleting / r/fitness level `` first day training , what should i do ? 
  bodyweight only and i dont want to eat more '' threads but christ , no fun allowed . 
  the only good thing they 've done recently is allow the bigger by the day series but even then they deleted the part 2 post before because `` muh not bodybuilding '' even though it 's part of a bodybuilding series and features a bodybuilding couple . 
  imo they should allow a lot more fun/general content, 
  you cant deliver something that was never made due to the startup crashing and burning during development, 
  it 's a potential presale platform at best,

  this is so much ideology it 's making me angry, 
  do people actually think bernie bro is a sexist slur ? 
  lmao, 
  your ideology is a meme, 
  minimum wage argument is a bad meme . 
  get a real argument . 
  no one works for minimum wage, 
   uhh . . nope !, 
  i 'd fight a war for capitalism though . 
  absolutely disgusting, 
  skinny fat is not a slur . 
  if they are 150 pounds as a dude and they have little to no muscle mass then they would probably be skinny fat, 
  imagine being so mediocre the only thing you have going for you is that you 're not overweight, 
  i got banned from me_irl once . 
  instead of whinging about le skeleton menace i drew a picture of brd and they let me back into the only good sub . 
  redditors need thicker skin, 
  do you even know what `` dog whistle '' means ? 
  nah `` racist garbage '' means you 're racist garbage,
