   picture of bernie sandlers, 
  ctrl + w, 
  oh i forgot i do rear delt flys after shrugs most times, 
  but i can just [ buy another one at the market ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hizdpcg.jpg ), 
  wanting to close your country 's borders to muslims is racist, 
   technically not because muslim isnt a race . 
  bernie is barely even left, 
  he has no justification for closing the borders to the middle east other than `` scary brown people '' . 
  does he even know that south-east asia is the bigger muslim population ? 
  there 's no war here, 
  isis is n't a country that you can close your borders to . 
  the united states has only taken in just over two thousand syrian refugees . 
  that 's nothing . 
  you ca n't try to justify your xenophobia and racism because there 's a bad terrorist group people are trying to get away from, 
  good brawling , babushka, 
   a sum of money granted by the government or a public body to assist an industry or business so that the price of a commodity or service may remain low or competitive . 
  subsidies sound 100 % capitalist to me mate, 
  mhm mhm good shit good shit that 's some good shit right th ere, 
  trump memes are so boring . 
  my god, 
  oh no it 's liberal trash, 
  this is what americans actually believe, 
  then you should know better about how the political spectrum works, 
  he 's moderate left . 
  he may seem far left to yanks and some other countries but that 's because they 're so far right to begin with . 
  he 's not left enough, 
  comrade stalin would bring great prosperity to america and the world, 
  you have been fed too much liberal propaganda, 
   , nightmare missions ( 2nd full length campaign ) ,, 
  this is a bit generous . 
  it 's the campaign again but the enemies are zombies . 
  same dialogue , same mission areas , same boss fights from when i played it, 
  i override it anyway with my settings so shrug, 
  religion is incompatible with the radical left, 
  honestly how is everyone needing to `` adjust '' all the time ? 
  i 've seen it way too often on reddit for how little i 've actually seen it irl and i 've never needed to do it myself, 
  thanks / u/spez i 'm glad we can all have this valuable discussion, 
  if the choice is sell your labor below the actual value or starve , it 's wage slavery, 
  you 're talking about it now, 
  cook and eat white people, 
  nothing says misogynist more than comparing a woman to an animal . 
  why are gamers so trash, 
  can you imagine them actually saying this shit in real life lmao, 
  australia is the mainland, 
  admins have said multiple times that there has been no evidence of any brigading or anything else by srs that the whiny pissbabies accuse them of, 
  i fucking hate that `` fuccboi '' got stolen by those nerds, 
  i 'm very upset that the flavours are different colours in different countries . 
  salt and vinegar is purple god damn it, 
  naxx never had heroic mode, 
  tfw sausagefest degree, 
  are dates not common everywhere ? 
  why i 'm `` antisocial '', 
   threads like this are when you see the users of reddit 's true colors [ +293 ], 
    those colors being , white , off-white , and eggshell . 
  when did default reddit get so zesty, 
  yeah no is different to yeah nah . 
  it 's confusing, 
  i 've only heard americans say `` yea - no '' as in they did n't finish saying yeah . 
  `` yeah nah '' you say it completely and is super common way to say `` no '' casually, 
  with css on and res it 's a giant kuriboh ( yugioh furball ), 
   implying i had sex recently, 
  good post, 
  g u l a g, 
  holy fuck yugioh cards are a mouthful, 
  this but unironically tbh, 
   mainstream online media outlets ( buzzfeed , breitbart , huffpost, 
   mainstream media outlets, 
  lol, 
   and the rockets ' red glare , the bombs bursting in air ,, 
  honestly amazed this is real, 
  kotaku is actually good, 
  gamer bro tears sustain me, 
  sad, 
  you forgot the ham, 
  mate it 's australia 's national dish almost , i know what i 'm on about . 
  ham or it 's not a parmi, 
   english muffin, 
   sandwich, 
  pick one, 
  left ( actual ) libertarianism is freedom, 
  those sidebar definitions oh lawd, 
   ** social-democrats ** : voting democrats who use `` oligarchy '' as a rallying cry when their preferred candidate doesnt win nominations or elections . 
   ** democratic-socialists ** : voting social-democrats who want workers to seize control of the means of production , questionably peacefully/legally . 
   ** communists ** : non-voting and voting social-democrats or democratic-socialists who deliberately spread propaganda and have unilaterally decided for the rest of us that sanders is america 's `` last chance '' ; aka the sandernistas . 
  the non-voting ones believe that america 's electoral system is rigged beyond repair and is a `` tool of the bourgeoisie '' , but the ones who are registered to vote believe that they can `` use the parliaments as a tribune for revolutionary agitation and propaganda '' . 
   ** social-anarchists ** : they actually believe sanders is `` too capitalist '' , not registered to vote ( eg : the blm protesters in seattle ) . 
  they are supportive of violence usually as an individual or in small groups , see propaganda of the deed . 
  come up with a different name for your dish then if it 's not a parmi, 
  remember when memes were good ? 
  how the hell do you meet people at university ? 
  i 'm going to sound like a complete autist but it 's really hard for me ; these weekends staying home are killing me .
