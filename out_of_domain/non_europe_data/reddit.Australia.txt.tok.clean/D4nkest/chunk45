  not everyone lives in cushy first world countries masturbating to the american flag, 
  that made me laugh . 
  liberals have no idea, 
  sounding awfully counter-revolutionary there comrade, 
  if you have to protest , the current system is n't what 's right . 
  this but unironically, 
   5 ' 11 '' ( basically 6 ' ), 
  manlets , when will you learn, 
  i actually really like that look , but i 've definitely seem an almost exact replica a few too many times, 
  the immortal emancipatory science of marxism-leninism, 
  there are times where it will insert them in the wrong spot and confuse two lines of code as one though, 
  and thus should be abolished, 
  you can tell from the `` x-post r/australia '' in the title that these are definitely not american cops, 
  hey guys i 'm looking to upgrade the ol' blackwidow ultimate 2013 . i really love how it feels but would like the upgrade to be a less noisy board - with white or light blue key lights .

  reading out all those side effects really kills the mood of the ad, 
  charts do n't have to start at zero,

  western imperialism is almost 100 % responsible, 
   i doubt [ devon island ] 's off limits , just stupid hard to get to .

  islamic terrorists believe in right-wing ideology ... what part of what they believe do you consider left ? 
   derogatory . 
  a person who refuses to strike or join a trade union or who takes the place of a striking worker . 
  literally by definition a scab, 
  it deserves it too , one of the best new shows,

  damn phil 's getting old, 
  wait kirby 's a boy ?

  yes ? 
  it 's a burger .
