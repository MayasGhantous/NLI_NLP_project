  like what ? 
  i guarantee most of reddit never heard of her before last month, 
  edit : oh her personal life we have no business getting involved in ? 
  forgot this was reddit business and cause to get mad at her, 
  completely irrelevant to her capability of being the ceo of reddit or any actions she took during her role as ceo of reddit tho, 
  i know more about it than you kid . 
  salary negotiations are bad for reddit and i agree with spez or kn0thing who explained why a few days ago, 
  would be way better without the cards from the credits included, 
  atg is better than parallel , but parallel is still good . 
  as long as you 're not above parallel you 'll be fine, 
  why are you trying to cut when you weigh 135 pounds ? 
  it 's pretty normal dude . 
  eat less sodium and do n't compare yourself to guys with washboard abs if you do n't have a lot of muscle yourself . 
  you 're almost underweight and you 're probably pretty skinny so it is dangerous to keep cutting, 
  man he looks great in that black crew neck tshirt . 
  and that long sleeve button up . . and in that vneck tshirt . . ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ his ^ ^ ^ shoulders, 
   that 's another significant problem that definitely needs some resources devoted to it , i 'm not sure if i 'll get back to it myself at some point ( if moderators decide it 's a high priority for me to work on ) or if someone else will pick it up . 
  wait ** no one ** is working on anti-brigading tools ? 
  does n't reddit have tons of employees now ? 
  get your shit together, 
  sure seems like a lot of people . 
  69 active employees . 
  i 'm honestly wondering what reddit is even doing with them . 
  they should have several people working on this , not one guy who has to stop development on a majorly requested feature to work on a separate issue that is irrelevant in comparison, 
  i know , but given that only one person is apparently tasked with development maybe they should double their workforce . 
  reddit has 50 million in the bank and they 're currently breaking even , i think they can afford to, 
   june 2013 -  july 2015, 
  recaptcha also makes you pick out two-three pictures of some food ( steak , hamburgers , icecream , pasta ) if you do it often enough . 
  ( i run in to it a lot on 4chan ), 
  i got this from / u/troythetoyboy last night :, 
   i keep removing them because the content has nothing to do with bodybuilding . 
  hopefully he just means that because it was a fashion video it was removed just this week , and future gym ones are allowed . 
  i mean it 's one video every two or three weeks , it 's not exactly clogging up the front page, 
  are we talking about / r/polandball again ? 
  boy i love that sub, 
   green dude, 
   not recognizing our lord and saviour ron paul, 
  [ conservative reactionaries right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/47uukof.gifv ) . 
  also you do n't need to np link an official reddit subreddit as they do n't use the css hack, 
  [ red is general predictions , blue is my hopefuls that will cause drama the likes have never been seen on reddit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e16hiy2.png ), 
  honestly i hope they actually do ban sexism/racism and all that but i do n't think they will . 
  there 's too many users that have those views and you ca n't ban hundreds of thousands of accounts as they keep making new ones , as well as new subreddits . 
  / r/topmindsofreddit is much better since conspiratard got rid of linking reddit threads, 
  totally agree with you man . 
  a lot more people care about the casual side of lifting than the professional competitions and this sub should be inclusive of both groups , not just the pros, 
  i am so fucking disappointed in you reddit . 
  what the fuck was the point of announcing this ama and hyping it all up when the decision is to do fuck all like you always do when there 's controversy . 
  what a waste of time . 
  how do you only drink 40 ounces a day ? 
  ( not even 1.25 l ) ? 
  i drink at least 3l ( ~ 100 ounces ) , usually more and sometimes i still get dehydration headaches, 
  he could be in healthy bmi but still have too much fat, 
  i already did the work bot go away, 
   / r/lostgeneration, 
  this * is n't * a satire sub ? 
  sometimes my elbow tendons ( i think it 's these ) feel funny/uncomfortable when doing tricep work . 
  is there anything i can do to fix this ? 
  usually i try to keep the arm as straight as possible after the gym if they feel like that as i 've hurt my elbow before by leaning on them too hard ( the pinched tendon where it 's your pinky and ring finger ) and do n't want that to happen again, 
  why do americans get so anal about what is and is n't barbecue ? 
  in australia barbecues are very common and you just have whatever the hell you want : sausages , pork chops , burger patties , little schnitzels , satays usually over [ these at the local park ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j6kwvee.jpg ) or [ one of these at home ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nml74wd.jpg ) if you 're a rich cunt . 
  slow cooking barbecue sounds painfully boring and what even is a barbecue pit ? 
  [ ] ( #s `` to srdd we go '' ), 
  / fit / would love you, 
  pls be in london, 
  my gym fines you $ 50 if you keep dropping the weights . 
  it works, 
  bros do n't let bros me half reppers, 
  they were the quiet but feisty girl at school that was very into calling others out on their shit until she left school early and now you have n't seen her in a couple years . 
  srs is largely irrelevant/dead now , and i say that as someone who was a frequent poster a few years ago . 
  leddit loves it 's boogeymen though so they stay relevant in the minds of new redditors as the evil skeleton brigade that hate free speech and straight white men when in actuality it 's just shining a light on what crappy comments reddit upvotes . 
  so i guess srs is watching from the sidelines , sarcastically taking credit for anything that censors the shitty parts of reddit, 
  they do n't brigade really , the whole point is `` look at this dipshit racist saying ' i hate all niggers ' [ +90000 ] '' . 
  they want reddit to look bad so they would n't downvote it otherwise it 'd look like the majority of reddit is n't racist etc , and i do n't believe it 's common to comment brigade although from the rules it is allowed, 
  no you 're probably thinking of the right sub but you 've been fed too much reactionary propaganda , it 's okay  . 
  they have effortposts like cb but the majority is low effort direct links, 
  you are not 13 % bf , you are not even 15 % bf . 
  probably 18-20ish, 
  sure bro , [ you buying ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g4e7nwy.png ) ? 
  le epic / r/polandball clubhouse meme :\\ ^ ), 
   never having had real bbq in their life . 
  m8 im pretty fucken sure my sausage sizzle is legitimate . 
  you can fuck right off, 
  ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke . 
  what meat is that ? 
  and chips with barbecue ? 
  but it makes you sound like a robot if you say females . 
  it 's dehumanising if you say `` men '' or `` guys '' and then just `` females '' for women/girls/ladies / etc. 
  we call animals female . 
  we call female humans women . 
  so * that 's * what that burnie periscope was about ... 
  my aussie gym has one squat rack , one power cage and one smith machine . 
  no bench press stations , you have to do dumbbells on a spare bench or if you must use barbells , in the rack/cage,
