  i want to hear x-rays !, 
  and i - i want to - i want to smell dark matter !, 
  do you see the absurdity of what i am ? 
  i ca n't even express these things properly because i have - i have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language !, 
  but i know i want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws ; and feel the solar wind of a supernova flowing over me . 
  i 'm a machine , and i can know much more . 
  i can experience so much more . 
  but i 'm trapped in this absurd body . 
  and why ?!, 
  because my five creators thought that `` god '' wanted it that way . 
  ac games have a limited weapon choice and generally revolve around pressing a button to counter attack to win fights . 
  games like chivalry , wotr and vikings have n't really improved upon mount and blades melee combat mechanically . 
  it is the starcraft of its genre . 
  really ? 
  it never grew on me . 
  i went ahead and picked up caribbean and played for a few hours , it 's very pre alpha . 
  the most promising thing about the game is the `` gunner '' troop type reasonably reliably manning mounted guns in battles . 
  i adore pendor and even perisno a little , would like to see what a paid team can do . 
  im the type that doesnt mind outdated graphics if the game is mechanically stimulating . 
  action stations !, 
  pretty sure breathing in car exhaust is poisonous . 
  should ban cars too !, 
  products with food additives next . 
  seems legit . 
  the horn can be found when someone occupies a province beyond the wall . 
  if wildlings blow it the fortlevel buildings in the watch provinces are removed and the event `` notch draw loose '' that fires when wildlings are attacking the watch on a wall province no longer fires . 
  this makes it easier for the wildlings to control the wall and get the wildling horde ( vanilla mongol style ) event .
