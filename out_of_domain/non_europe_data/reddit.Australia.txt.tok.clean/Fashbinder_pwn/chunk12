  play as tywin lannister . 
  do whatever is required to further your cause , but certainly not evil , 
  * kneels before the one true king , hand on heart and fingers in a bag around neck, 
  the island adventures where you wash up on shore , there can literally be 100 of them . 
  one of which i planned for the character to encounter someone who spoke valyian with a translator ( milisan/dany/unsullied buying ) in which the character who did n't read the book got the text in valyrian and had to take the translators word on what happened . 
  alas , im not quite motivated enough these days but if someone provides some cool localization ( interesting story/decision options ) i could muster up the strength to add it . 
  mycroft : `` if anything happened to joan , i will never forgive myself '', 
  sherlock : `` well that wo n't be an issue . 
  if anything happens to joan , i will murder you . '', 
  / u/vicvyper nailed this episode 5 days ago on this sub . 
  hats off to him , a brilliant deduction . 
  when i was 15 , i baught my first pc game with my own money . 
  it was gta 3 . 
  unless there 's some radical new feature for pc , i 'll just buy watch_dogs instead . 
  i did n't event know what the n word meant until i was about 14 ( 1999 ) . 
  ( am australian ) and would loudly use the n word in the rhyme as a child :(, 
  as a member of a tiger advocacy group ( dttt ) , i find it discriminatory that humans are trained from a young age to catch tigers by the toe . 
  that would be as offensive to a tiger as showing a noose or a burning cross to a black person . 
  support our cause at / r/donttouchtigerstoes, 
  but im so lazy , also bored . 
  waiting for watch_dogs and elite dangerous . 
  you should post some locs on other forum in the style the events currently are ( or even just make the events :p ) and it might be interesting enough to motivate me :p need cool story + decisions to be made starting from the shipwreck ending in the corridor . 
  chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats !, 
  you can get std 's by having sex . 
  ban it ? 
  a vegan diet can result in a protein deficiency , ban it !, 
  you can die from drinking too much water , ban it ? 
  get police to go around measuring peoples water intake to ensure they do n't drink too much ? 
  any human should be able to do anything they want as long as it does n't negatively effect another within reason . 
  lol bitches be messing with my cadets and swords all day :p, 
  gim me the loc :p, 
  ninja plz , i did and even offered a prize . 
  its how cyricist jorda and ummm umbra were chosen :(, 
  brisbane . 
  always the n word . 
  you had one rule ... one rule . 
  there 's like , 0 games i want to play at the moment that are actually out ;p, 
  rip del pino and shitstark, 
  tbh if you check the mp closely , the circle kinda expands around the block . 
  pretty sure you can hack a camera into a camera and begin to `` hack '' the target without actually being in los to scan him . 
  invaders going to be strong . 
  lecresian empire : `` lecresian empire '', 
  might need to be ( i really havent done any formable modding myself , but i only see a reference to lecresia regarding tags/country names ), 
  two sets of '' '' in the decision localization will probably also cause problems . 
  i 've noticed the same use of double quotation marks in the ideas too . 
  it 's localizations version of too many brackets . 
  form_lecresian_empire_tur_desc : `` create one of the greatest `` fictional '' empires ever conceived . '', 
  all the loc problems are melting into eachother , if one breaks they 'll likely all break . 
  hope that helps ,

  remember when you bought a game you got the whole game . 
  pepperridge farm remembers . 
  edit : go invade someones game . 
  normally rpgs one shot a sports car but the guy has `` driving boost : more hit points to vehicles '' . 
  so you chase him down , he raises a bridge , you lower it , he makes a light red , you make it green , he raises poles in the middle of the road , you lack a battery slot because he has `` hacking boost ( add 1 battery slot ) '' . 
  seeing your car wrecked , he gets out and shoots you , you shoot back , you die because he has `` blume weapon perk : less recoil on shots '' or `` 3 new weapons '' or a `` biometric assault rifle '' . 
  an optimist would say the guns are just weapon skins , but as the others arent , i doubt it . 
  they 'll probably be op in an effort to get people to buy the dlc . 
  this sounds like a spoiler , but it is not ... or is it ?

  hello zoser i am you from the future , i need you to send me $ 5000 . 
  someone is trying to go back in time and kill you , im here to stop them but i need your help .

  are you concerned that when you arrive , people will be shooting a gun in each hand up into the air and you 'll have to scamper around under cover to avoid the bullets that fall to the ground ? 
  because that 's my greatest fear about going to the us . 
  that , and that 14 year old girls look 18 . 
  only the holder of c_harrenhal will be effected . 
  because a majority of redditors are lefties . 
  one side of the government wants retirement age at 67 the other 70 . 
  one wants 16b spent on item x and the other 14 b. 
  there 's truly no difference .

  it 's amazing how many people have n't seen the movie `` waiting '', 
  bbc 's sherlocs mycroft was just so super cool badass up until now ive been kind of disappointed with elementry 's version . 
  i was even foolishly believing he was just a schmuck restaurateur . 
  should have known something was off when he used a bomb to blow up sherlocks stuff at the start of the season . 
  what kind of chef is also competent enough to set off a bomb :p, 
  when they do that shit , i do it as well . 
  waiting out the whole timer ? 
  i 'll wait the full timer also , 
  i do it , for great justice . 
  happy birthday sir !, 
  that bf3 texture mod is a free download is n't it ? 
  for a farmer to check real time weather reports or send his monthly myob file to a bank in mt isa or longbeach , the 1mb/s he already has access to is more than enough . 
  wow servers are physically in the us . 
  in canada , you are geographically closer to the us , therefore you have a lower ping . 
  a $ 50b + nbn would increase the speed of data that is transfered within australia 1000 % . 
  however the data from australia to japan to west us will still travel through the 20 year old copper `` pipes '' and not result in a substantial increased transfer speed nor change the amount you pay from your isp or your bandwith cap . 
  100 % of internet users want better faster internet , it would be popular for any government to give that to voters . 
  if money grew on trees , the lnp governement would give us a nbn . 
  regretably it does not , so the government assessed the benefits provided vs the cost and deems the money better spent elsewhere . 
  you 're blaming the guy in office for 8 months for the countrys sad state ?
