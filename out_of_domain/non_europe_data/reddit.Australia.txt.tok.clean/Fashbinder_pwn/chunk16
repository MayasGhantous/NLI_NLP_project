  the internet is like lots of people talking at a bus stop . 
  - pepper ridge farms 1982, 
  of all the games listed , excluding the morrowind purists , this is the only one worth playing . 
  rpg 's these days are very casual for the console ` press x to win ' generation . 
  reddit lefties are loud . 
  the whine started the day he was sworn in . 
  i have 30k for op if consent to film is offered . 
  giving away 12b , a nbn that does n't do much for australias as faster national speed does nothing when we still have 40 year old `` pipes '' connecting us to japan and then to the us where most servers are located , school halls , carbon tax and home insulation ? 
  i 'd have invested in assets rather than socialist popularism . 
  `` downgrading '' , 20 versions of the game at launch with varied day1 dlc and paid only perks and this indication of poor optimization makes me glad i did n't pre-order . 
  will rather pay $ 60 for 8/10ths of a game that 's worth playing than gamble with a pre order for 9/10ths . 
  this is generally a good idea before buying anything ubi or ea touches . 
  you 're not voting for them in the hope they become the new government , its to send the strongest possible message ( more effective than rabble rousing protestors or letter writing whiners ), 
  when the new opposition sees that the desire for censor free internet accrues x % of the vote , they 'll be inclined to adopt those policies to pick up those votes next election . 
  the same concept can apply to any western ~ ~ oligarchy ~ ~ democracy . 
  hey man , kill me and then give the pack back , i 'll split the 20 with you ? 
  double the value of transcontinental runs and the prices , let `` pve traders '' work at half efficiency ? 
  the bsg bible : `` it quickly became apparent that gaius was more than just a good student , he was a literal genius . 
  by the time he was 14 , he was completing college-level courses and by the time he was 21 he had his first doctorate under his belt and was being hotly pursued by every major university in the colonies to set up a research lab . '', 
  is this a paid review or remunerated in some way ? 
  were you restricted from making negative comments ? 
  the spirit stat, 
  australia and new zealand both use dollars . 
  it was a pragmatic question . 
  tb has enlightened many to `` paid/no negative '' review shenannigans and it seems prudent to ask . 
  best not to introduce facts into reddits abbot circle jerk . 
  here 's some gold to ensure you keep to the status quo in future . 
  dear admins , could you implement a voting system in which if people believe that comments are unproductive they could be `` downvoted '' and hidden ? 
  this would be a suitable alternative to the current method of insta banning people . 
  i could physically go around killing people today ( australia ) , without a gun ( not easily obtained ) id probably buy petrol and a lighter , rent a large vehicle or even a really large knife . 
  ban petrol , cars and knives !, 
  save our children 's lives !, 
  was the kid 's name jauffrey ? 
  people who have armour on are usually knights . 
  monarchist : because if it was n't so highly venerated the us would be as ashamed of their treason as germans are of the world wars . 
  republican : merika !, 
  tbh i think the battles are as mechanically fun and interesting as the total war series , they only lack in the graphically . 
  every post about abbot in worldnews has been a circlejerk . 
  i liked hacker evolution and to a lesser extent the spinoffs . 
  i 'd not waste my time without adding mechanics or methods that are superior to that which already exists . 
  i think controversial issues like climate change and other funding that is pragmatically questionable should have a option for donating in your tax return . 
  i still agree with john howard on climate change to the effect of `` unless policies are enacted globally , there 's little point in australia undertaking radical action as the result will be inconsequential . '', 
  eli5 version : the bath is overflowing and a diamond encrusted thimble might cost a lot of money and make you feel good , but wont actually do much . 
  gw2 = nothing you did mattered . 
  killed someone ? 
  got a wvw keep ? 
  does n't matter . 
  aa = kill someone with something on their back and its yours . 
  my girlfriend and i *, 
  international emission trading would require country 's agreeing on a price/terms . 
  not much point when china/japan/india will ~ ~ never ~ ~ unlikely make such an agreement . 
  there is no market for research/sales when the countries that cause a the majority of the earth emissions are unregulated . 
  rather than spending money ` whatever the cost ' nationally for no effect globally , we should be using diplomatic means to enact a global mandate/treaty/agreement . 
  eli5 again : everyone in china/india/japan drops rubbish in your yard , everyone in australia picks it up and you pay them billions of dollars to do so . 
  you still have a crap tonne of rubbish in your yard and you 're out of pocket for billions . 
  as an australian , watching this video made me very mad ;(, 
  abbott for another ~ ~ 2.5 ~ ~ 6.5 years . 
  the 45 + m being is being spent on development . 
  swotor probably had 2 million on development and 200m on marketing . 
  i would n't donate rotten food to sick children , this is cruel . 
  id rape her , murder her children and then crush her skull like this !, 
  start them on something worthwhile , not eso , not anything by ea , not anything by ubisoft . 
  i found this documentary on the topic : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gayl5h46qnq&amp;feature=kp, 
  australian with premium wtfast . 
  you can only do so much with 50 year old copper `` pipes '' that only go to japan and then to the us ;(, 
  when you kill someone with a pack or fish on their back , or in control of a ship/vehicle with pack/fish . 
  you gain a tangible , real benefit . 
  the rest is your standard mmo , but instead of housing/farming/guildlocationclaiming / boats/vehicles/customization comming `` soon '' its there at launch . 
  tbh instead of a person with a teaching degree ( sports/science/english ) trying to solve social disagreements between kids , it should be a police liason ( some schools have this ) or a teacher with legal/justice studies . 
  apply current in force legislation to reported incidents with school tier consequences . 
  none of this `` who started it '' `` you called bob fat '' instead you call it `` aggravated assault '', 
  would n't hurt to teach seniors the criminal code either . 
  agree ? 
  ( the question ), 
  rhllor is the most fun ... right ? 
  turn your fanboy blinders up to 10 . 
  i was critical of an admin when they removed pcmasterrace and got shadowbanned . 
  you 're absolutely right that the lack of loss for the aggressor in every facet of the game is kinda disappointing . 
  i have 40k fishing and a boat , being jumped by an eastern zerg is really disappointing . 
  i 've been using the boat just to find schools , then despawn boat when fish is hooked ( no sextant spotting ) , fish in water , summon clipper and hand in . 
  the decision matrices is as follows when spotting someone with a pack/fish :, 
  * i have nothing they can take, 
  * i will attack, 
  the results of the decision :, 
  * i win and profit, 
  * i lose, 
  anytime i go to reply , you 've already made the reply :( all you 're missing are the fash jokes :p, 
  the only other tv series in existence that i enjoyed as much as bsg was hbo 's rome . 
  ( game of thrones too ), 
  if you 're only just seeing bsg now , you may have missed `` caprica '' . 
  same world , different target audience , but explains cylon creation , monotheism and resurrection . 
  the game has been out in korea for a year . 
  it 's being translated to english . 
  some item names are being arbitrarily changed . 
  i do not expect any mechanical changes that dont already exist in korea . 
  trion ask xl games to make changes , they do n't do it themselves . 
  alpha/beta/launch means nothing these days . 
  i confess to being retarded sometimes :(, 
  need to find out what kind of tree that was :(, 
  you mean / r/trees ?
