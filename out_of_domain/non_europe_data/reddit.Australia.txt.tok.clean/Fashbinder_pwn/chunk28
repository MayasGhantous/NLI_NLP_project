  i have an account for sale , few hundred gold , mag gear , emph scepter . 
  id like a pc game that has content at launch compared to others in the genre . 
  the transition to the female only workplace will surely be smooth . 
  a friend and i *, 
  i played through several times to try and get different results . 
  i did not succeed . 
  there 's something special about getting the `` you died in a carriage accident '' event and having an extra option to save your character appear . 
  10/10 whoever made that event . 
  as they 're in bed with hbo : rome, 
  ciaran hinds , james purefoy , kevind mckidd . 
  you 're in the cell with pullo after versengetarix surrenders . 
  you get chosen to find the eagle instead of pullo . 
  very few ? 
  i noticed zero in my rewinds . 
  everyone is in the same position doing the same thing regardless of any action on my part . 
  i 've not been so impatient since i was 8 years old on december 24th ;(, 
  there is also a kid in jail for talking smack on facebook with no real or present ability to perform the action . 
  talk to portmaster . 
  he will take you on his ship for a fraction of the cost of a boat . 
  i am willing to distribute picutures of my birth . 
  nsfw i am naked . 
  being a conservative has nothing to do with racism . 
  this fictional character makes a rousing speech in the tv show ` the newsroom ', 
  yes , it does so little and runs so poorly . 
  i did however develop a m&b itch that needs to be scratched . 
  after pop development has slowed/stopped i did n't think there would be anything amazing to play but nova aetas has my attention . 
  be happy mate , the land is good . 
  you want some ? 
  nova aetas is very well polished , a great story in a familiar setting and has very indepth kingdom/town management . 
  taxes/religion/titles / tech/customization . 
  it 's up there with pendor . 
  for me, 
  nsfw video ; http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1nnr9q_sorry-dad-i-m-naked_redband, 
  not a story mode like vc , but the notes/game world being set in vanilla 's future , kinda like the red wars mod . 
  gameplay looks pretty similar to your oldschool arcade shooter with some ` finishers ', 
  feels like its a year old and this `` new content '' is just a port from the previous version . 
  imagine if starcraft 2 launched without the zerg , applaud them a year later for releasing it for free ? 
  tbh limited resources in space . 
  diet/food distribution likely controlled . 
  just watched the first episode . 
  huge plot twist . 
  10/10 worth watching just for that . 
  starcraft was never big because of its campaign map . 
  just watched ep 2 . 
  was references to genetics/eugenics and selecting people for a purpose . 
  i can accept it as part of the story . 
  i have an account for sale, 
  pretty sure in public its just violence . 
  just saw ep three . 
  more main character death than game of thrones , more twists than lost . 
  shame it 's gone from scifi to fiction with magical powers :(, 
  i saw stabbing and cairns and thought abboriginal . 
  read article and saw the name `` thaiday '' , likely an islander . 
  stereotyping not racism !, 
  i think its ok to rape a girl in a short skirt because shes asking for it ... . . consequences be damned ? 
  do n't forget the making the eight ambition in game . 
  ca n't recall but i think you get a prestige bonus/some kind of modifier with people of a certain personality . 
  right and wrong is subjective to culture and time . 
  wikibot , what is penis ? 
  how is there not some kind of spoofer that makes youtube think adds are being watched when they are not : s, 
  i was unaware women were given field roles while deployed . 
  re : bloodhounds etc, 
  i do n't see how . 
  he put the turtle neck on his chest and called it very hipster . 
  worse than treason and killing your countrymen . 
  wikibot , what is fraud ? 
  im not making any gain or benefit by running an ad spoofer . 
  til : american minorities love a free ride . 
  i 've got 99 problems but cards aint one . 
  please tell me some secret santa horror stories !, 
  eg : 42 year old male , registers daughter , opens package and gets severed phallus . 
  eli5 : how do i make cocaine ? 
  i will make / u/blackninja do this . 
  ca n't recall if you can scope to dead characters or if theres a special scope like `` fatherifdead '' but it 's really just adding a single event triggered along with the ` show me sword people/dragons etc ', 
  desc = `` these are the people slain by root.getbestname '', 
  effect = {, 
  any_character = {, 
  limit = { killer = root }, 
  all the little faces will appear on a toolbar if you were the killer . 
  aussie bandwith capped , so cant do it myself ;p, 
  trevor chan 's capitalism 2 . 
  paradox is the only studio i think would make a modern version and have the experience to give green number fiddlers like me a kick . 
  for those who have played it , capitalism lab added some cool new features but i 'd love to see it get a modern do-over . 
  for those who have n't played it but like strategy , it 's without peer . 
  i 've uninstalled vc . 
  ( my small ssd is prime realestate ) have had so much fun with silverstag , quite miss pendor and thouroughly adore nova atlas 's kingdom management/villiage building/colonizing . 
  pressing w to move your boat foward to attack enemies becomes quite dull quite quickly and that 's vc 's only selling point . 
  oh , for your bug , try enable cheats ( via launcher options ) and control + left click to teleport your guy to land . 
  wikibot , what is nemesis ? 
  i think you mean the great treason of english colonial america . 
  nice try good gaming staffer !,
