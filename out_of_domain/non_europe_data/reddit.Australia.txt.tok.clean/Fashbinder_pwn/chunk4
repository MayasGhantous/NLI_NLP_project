  you only beat france once you deplete their manpower pool . 
  occupy core off them so they recieve increased exhaustion , preferably something on a hill protected by rivers , have a small stack about 5-15 on that province and the remainder of your forces in adjacent provinces in a larger volume . 
  when france attacks your small stack with their large stack , move to reinforce , win the battle and wait for them to do it again . 
  cheeze for sure but super effective . 
  when they run out of manpower , carpet them , take what you want and do it again the instant truce ends . 
  not being able to marry can be overcome with a different republic type/adm tech level to unlock . 
  selecting a rulers strength is advantageous for `` pumping '' ideas while maintaining tech level . 
  western republics seem to have no problem keeping `` ahead '' technologically while filling ideas compared to a monarchy who might have an 1/1/1 ruler for 100 years . 
  as an australian i find your lack of patriotism disappointing . 
  my sociopath uncle sam turned 18 and decided to kill his mother . 
  my drunk great uncle mick o'mac michaelson still harbours resentment today ? 
  half the world is rioting/rebelling/at war , being oppressed , starving to death , lacks food and water , but descendants of britain are slightly better off , 
  ps : australia isnt a colonial region or a releasable nation :(, 
  sorry , was at work and could n't check myself , `` too many gp alliances '' is defiantly an opinion modifier but if you 're sure its not there it might be `` hardcoded '' . 
  sidestory : when eu4 came out i made a few mods , and wanted to make a top end espionage idea to kill someones ruler/heir at the cost of ae . 
  was super mad when i found it was n't moddable . 
  i got a little bit excited , am i a perv or a pedophile or both ? 
  the reduction will only be for the war goal , 11.5 ae . 
  other provinces even if claimed will charge 15 ae * modifiers .

  just before midnight i said `` it 's almost midnight , we 'd better kiss now before you turn into a pumpkin '', 
  it worked .

  if a competent english king can subjugate the french/scottish/irish centurys before history dictates it surely the can do the same with their colonial actions .

  im australian and was asleep , about 14 years old when my mother called out `` come and see this , history is being made ! '', 
  to which i replied `` it 's 11pm , will it be on tomorrow ? '', 
  and she retorted `` it will be on tv for the next whole year ! '', 
  i rolled my eyes and said `` fine i 'll watch it then ! '', 
  it 's not the salary that they aim to get rich off , its the millions in deals for money/assets/future post office perks that are offered in exchange for his in office actions .

  fashbinders handy guide on the right should help explain education . 
  the type of education you get is based on the one you pick . 
  the level ( 1-4 ) is based on the childs learning . 
  the childs base stat gains per year and traits are effected by his guardians . 
  this allows a player who micros to manipulate stats/traits without having to cheezily switch at age 14 . 
  from memory a 0 learning child has a 100 % chance to gain a level 1 education , a child with 15 learning has 100 % for level 4 . 
  from memory common/opinions/opinion _ modifiers.txt would have the different religion penalty if you wanted to try it out personally . 
  naturally it 's not just wildlings , anyone in essos too , and i 'd suspect in 100 years your kings guard/council would be filled with people that look like khal drogo . 
  i used to work in fast food and saw a guy call his boss a `` fuck wit '' on his last day too . 
  i was equally disappointed and thought it was a lack of integrity . 
  the greens do have one or two ideologies that many people agree with , usually pot/environment . 
  the reason you should n't vote for them are the remaining 50 , they 're insane . 
  depending on the state it can include curfews , death taxes , 0.7 % gdp foreign aid and radical increases to corporate tax . 
  imagine if when gillard was negotiating with independants they demanded something outrageous and in an effort to retain power gillard accepted . 
  we 'd be forced to endure that . 
  similarly the greens in the senate have been known to `` oppose '' reform that has passed the lower house for in an effort to get such a deal . 
  furthermore , every vote is worth about $ 2 for the party , paid by the aec . 
  some parties exist like `` the sex party '' for the purpose of generating revenue , null vote if you want to be a `` cool kid '' or make a statement do n't get conned by voting for a niche party . 
  most importantly , if you vote liberal or labour you are dealing with two center left populist parties . 
  none of them will have any significant policy differences , with the exception that when in office ( hawke/keating/gillard / rudd ) the labour party spent lavishly on social projects ( schools/solar/nbn ) while under the liberals ( howard/abbot ) they payed off previous governments debt and focused on strengthening the economy . 
  lol , this is probably the weakest qq in the entire thread . 
  it 's probably worse than the adult girl who was offended because an adult male said `` i could please a woman '', 
  in instances where my ally wont join me in a war , i 've started checking their opinion of my war target , if it 's low , will check they have a positive treasury ( ledger ) and then check they 're not giving access/married/truced . 
  if all those look good i 'll declare war and look at the call to arms red x and see what the reason is and if it 's something i can correct would savescum . 
  it is disappointing the `` call willing allies : no '' tool tip is n't more verbose . 
  this adds a little more value to excommunication ( catholics pre 1650 ) and sabotage reputation ( neighbours ) . 
  there is however an exploit/gamey/cheat way of bringing the ally into war . 
  simply declare on your target then declare on a opm that your ally would join in on but dont auto call them , manually call them . 
  your ally will now be at war with your first enemy . 
  i 'm a partner in a lazer tatoo removal franchise on the east coast of australia , pm me if you are interested/geographically relevant .

  landgrabbed too much 2 . got a coalition going 3 . 
  4 . gg no re, 
  simply dont take 100 % warscore in conquests . 
  play smart . 
  if going against the ottomans , take a byz core , release them as your vassal and in subsequent wars against the ottomans , force them to return cores to byz . 
  0 ae , land gained . 
  be an aggressive militarist later on when coalitions are laughable but early on you have to expand with legitimacy or face the wrath of a coalition . 
  takes some getting used to and restraint in peace demands , but the ae in 1.5 is fine . 
  ukraine/persia/muhguls / guyane/novogrod/stryia / syria and the danish/sweed/norwegian unions are also high value and of course anyone who has been annexed by a blob and not forced to revoke cores . 
  it 's crazy , i do n't think it was ever voted on . 
  similar to `` should we promote multiculturalism at the cost of our british etymology and tradition ? '', 
  but it 's super disappointing a game is being censored as opposed to simply being age restricted . 
  i will obtain immortality , so i can procrastinate and perform the required task later . 
  it 's not griefing . 
  it 's called `` controlling an area '' . 
  when you log in and a small group have built in a mountain opposite a field and they 're comming down and taking `` your '' wood , you should go and `` ruin '' their base , forcing them to relocate so `` your '' resources are uncontested . 
  when building ownership comes , there needs to be a flag or a `` capture '' point to remove ownership . 
  this all from a guy who made a 10 story base without stairs , using boxes and barricades to navigate up levels and a pillar to the ceiling to prevent this kind of thing . 
  time travel and world domination . 
  clearly the mods are causing the problem . 
  likely missing a bracket causing events to leak or two of the mods are replacing `` on_action pulse events '' causing the event to fire frequently or they havent been updated to be compatible with the game you 're using . 
  try running without the mods or just use console cheats to get your free cores etc. 
  check the box when loading your save to show `` incompatible saves '' after removing the mods . 
  the gsg mod providing new nations/cultures/ideas will probably break the save if removed , so perhaps look for an update that matches your eu4 version .
