  i hope its not government money funding those stickers :(, 
  us police shootings on reddit have me saying `` wtf '' and `` that seems fair '' 50/50 . 
  in australia , a pack of 25 tailored is about $ 20 . 
  fml, 
  bond street has a cheaper price point then winfield/bh etc, 
  can you buy some for me :(, 
  i think he inspired a generation of men to better themselves so they could bang their secretary when their wife is old and grey . 
  if you look at the political map of the region over the last 1000 years , it seems entirely reasonable for russia * to annex it . 
  russia is doing to the ukraine what the northern states did to the southern states . 
   `` historic posession '', 
  [ this map shows recent additions to the ukraine ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/simplified_historical_map_of_ukrainian_borders_1654-2014.jpg ), 
  [ i recently did my family tree , got to the late 1700s , here 's what the ukraine looked like in the 1700 's ] ( http://www.geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ukraine1700politicalmap-1024x683.png ), 
  i think historical claim is a strong casus belli . 
   the extermination of the jews was called the final solution . 
  `` ah that 's genius , i did n't know that . '', 
  campaign ai still does retarded stuff like running away , or having 80 units raiding around a city and not attacking . 
  mechanically much the same as rome 2 , but with more civic management . 
  politics do n't matter as you can reduce your power spamming embezzle/loyalty or theirs by just killing em off . 
  office bonuses are n't worth the disloyalty . 
  family tree is lackluster , its `` get a wife an wait '', 
  migrators/hordes are cool , but the rest is literally just rome2 . 
  tldr : if you think the horde mechanic is cool enough to rationalize the purchase , you 'll be ok . 
  if you 're looking for innovation or something new , you 'll be disappointed . 
  find someone they 're at war with . 
  go to war . 
  kill instead of replenish . 
  helps if rng hun personality likes you . 
  order your men to attack a routed unit . 
  it will be the last time you zoom in . 
  meanwhile , total war fans are waiting for ca 's first patch and for the rest of the game to be sold to them in dlc . 
  is it just me or is it disappointing there 's civil repercussions for `` hurt feelings '' . 
  the criminal code and the anti discrimination act do their jobs . 
  why is n't employment more like a romantic relationship , if one party is unhappy for any reason they walk away and it 's done ? 
  the mod files must be copied to < your documents  / paradox interactive/crusader kings ii/mod folder . 
  we also recommend any previous mod files in this folder are deleted before copying the new version . 
  windows users have been provided with an installer that performs this function automatically ,, 
   i download the windows installer, 
  did you run the installer ? 
   they needed a twitter , and facebook , and pinterest , and instagram . 
  i do n't use any of these because i do n't find any one person or topic important enough to need updates on . 
  what am i missing ? 
  eureka was the only other show in recent memory that was ok with radically changing cornerstones of the show . 
  tldr they did some time travel stuff resulting in different characters switching roles . 
  like , if in star trek , if data became commander and picard was an engineer and then continue with it for the rest of the series . 
  scene to convince you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdl8531vhwg, 
  i 'll never understand people who make decisions like this . 
  im going to enjoy buying additional cultures . 
  i really like how quickly they 've released their first patch , and not just announced it . 
  adults are responsible for their own actions . 
  manslaughter charge is a joke . 
  you can not assault someone over the phone . 
  / u/hootie _ hoo_blueberry get a coffee in the morning . 
  do it , do it do it !!!, 
  i 've pretty much just drunk a coffee , well , not far off . 
  a good idea . 
  shame such modding ability is intentionally locked . 
  need to have a niche that does n't already exist . 
  i convinced a friend to sell his bitcoins at $ 120 . 
  i should be charged with thieft . 
  the learner pilot could have been male . 
  no gender specific comments were made . 
  toughen up . 
  a guy approached me wanting to learn how to fly , i agreed in exchange for a sandwitch . 
  i went to explain how it worked but he didnt listen and just wanted to listen to the radio . 
  i got together with a friend to give him a little scare by shooting across his bow . 
  he screamed and got all emotional etc etc, 
  it 's only sexist if something happens because of gender . 
  the same applies for other forms of discrimination . 
  eg - `` because quayshan is black , he ca n't swim '', 
  not eg - `` quayshan cant swim '', 
  i do n't think anyone should listen to dean hall until he releases a product . 
  sounds like a 5k fine for nudism . 
   its called bbw . 
  thank you so much, 
  i would visit a site that gave reviews in this manner . 
  id like to see tb in a chair wearing 12 different bathrobes . 
  the tv show ? 
  do n't like it , too much of the female lead feigning acting . 
  the recent `` was drugged so have imaginary visions '' scene and the subsequent episodes fight scene at the end was so bad i had to turn it off . 
  fulcrum in the doll caused actual pain in my brain . 
  james spader ca n't save it . 
  but do n't get your reference, 
  white father , jamacan father and whore mother ? 
  niggardly is used somewhat in a song of ice and fire . 
  overcompensating for lack of breasts . 
  i have never heard of game grumps . 
  can i have a tldr including target audience ? 
  you could always add ai = no to the allow section of the cb .
