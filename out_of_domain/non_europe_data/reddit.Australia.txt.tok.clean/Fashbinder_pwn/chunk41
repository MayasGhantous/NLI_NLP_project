  take a look at the event that spawns the rebels . 
  dodge those conditions . 
  ca n't recall what it is . 
  gobble up the other wildlings and entice the watch onto your lands . 
  dont fight them on the wall . 
  once they 're yours , hold it , get horde event , take westeros . 
  i was 13 when i made a geocities webpage :(, 
   only 3 generations ago very native child in the country was forcibly taken from their home and put in a residential school, 
  many irish were forcibly removed from their homes , sent on a boat to the otherside of the world and forced to work for their freedom . 
  their descendants do n't have the same problems . 
  if the same problems exist 100 years from now , will it still be because of the hardships relatives that died before you existed endured ? 
  if every us president before him was black , obama would have been the first white president . 
  only adults can buy cigarettes in ireland right ? 
  i think adults should be able to make their own decisions . 
  do n't need to legislate to influence their decisions then ? 
  it 's the same engine . 
  12 + months from now when they 've pumped out a dlc a week and the sales have gone down they will ` work for hard '' to export the locked modding tools to . esf . 
  modding denied also . 
  found a mod that ported over r2 's praetorian guard and legionaires to attila . 
  nothing but copypasta . 
  looked pretty , worked well . 
  gon na be $ 10 for every other currently locked faction , britain , africa , arabia , sassanid vassals and those in poland . 
  the politics related ctd when you try to mod unlock a faction is 100 % intentional . 
  ca will sell us culture groups over the next 6 months because they 've successfully prevented us from adding it ourselves within a week . 
  we 're going to get cultures instead of content . 
  do n't buy it . 
  quick google should link you to adequate sources . 
  the tldr is that anything ( your action or event ) relating to the family tree/governers ctd 's while playing a locked faction . 
  your armor gleams in the sun !, 
  i 've placed an order for the 2014 tb swimsuit calendar and it still has n't arrived . 
  the thing to remember is that both roman empires are large , have large great power penalty and therefore after a few turns most factions will have a low opinion of them . 
  therefore , every faction who assaults them gains relations with everyone else . 
  as non romans , only attack romans . 
  everyone will love you . 
  as romans , you have a few turns to get people fighting eachother before they all hate you and love eachother . 
  415ad huns game , everyone loves me , can subjugate emergents and still have +200 with them . 
  i think the game needs a ` border tension ' mechanic . 
  because then we would n't buy their edited maps dlc . 
  like cig and that sparta one . 
  negative food gives -25 % wealth at a minimun + scaling unhappyness .

  get rome 1 . has the most features . 
  any synonym for girls on the internet will likely be porn . 
  or means if any of the following are true . 
  is_triggered_only = yes - remove that , should result in getting a cored prov once you occupy it for 12 months . 
  owner = { not = { has_country_modifier = nomadic_conquest } } -- is usually used to apply a hard cooldown to prevent every province using its own 12 month clock . 
  usually done by adding the modifier to the country ceeding the province as it ceedes it . 
  if it still does n't work , remove that as the flag is interfering . 
  convert both songs to . ogg and place in music folder with the name lothjonwar and lothjonpeace, 
  then paste this into songs.txt in the same folder, 
  song = {, 
  name = `` lothjonpeace.ogg '', 
  chance = {, 
  factor = 0, 
  is_at_war = yes, 
  song = {, 
  name = `` lothjonwar.ogg '', 
  chance = {, 
  factor = 0, 
  is_at_war = no, 
  do you sometimes find yourself not bothering with the 5th child or females ? 
  does it give you some kind of choice while also being a goldsink :p, 
  it split me in two !, 
  song = {, 
  name = `` lothjonwar.ogg '', 
  chance = {, 
  factor = 2, 
  is_at_war = yes, 
  factor = 0, 
  is_at_war = no,

  why give +15 to infantry when it disappears as soon as you enter combat ? 
  the setting is probably the least important part of tw games . 
  sell designs for rp plz . 
  need a 1v1 mode for when you and your friends argue about whos bot is better + for testing . 
  legislation exists irl because you ca n't have other people disappear from existence with the click of a button . 
  you can in video games so no greater effort than an ignore feature is required . 
  i dated a black girl who told me how bad it was for her great great great great grandparents being kept as a slave and how shes constantly oppressed as a result . 
  i hope the ban the sale and posession of spoons . 
  this will prevent me from scooping out my eyes and placing them in my anus . 
  has to be an odd number for those who cant even, 
  reminds me of that movie where johnny knoxville pretended to have special needs and ran in the special olympics . 
  trigger = { name = { not = 11andgratiot } }, 
  if you do n't download the new ck2 patch and dont download the new agot version that goes with it , it should seldom happen . 
  the girls in the pic look middle eastern . 
  i assumed he was playing with a keyboard and mouse :(, 
  it 's actually cheaper to kill her .

  #special one day war to make sure fra and bur starts in truce , balance reasons, 
  # add_attacker = bur,
