  you should stop that , it 's juvenile and moronic .

  nationalist socialists , nazi is a slur just like the n word or `` gook '',

  was in reference to soundcloud content saying `` x of y category of people have been harassed on the internet '', 
  some people found out a female game dev was sleeping with a games journalist and recieved a very positive review for a very sub par `` game '' . 
  people said `` there should be ethics in games journalism '' as a response . 
  internet crazies saw this outrageous request as an attack on a female because of her gender and started calling everyone involved a biggoted hater harasser . 
  some people believe these crazies and financially support them . 
  the crazies have innovated a new profession , the professional victim . 
  tldr : gamergate is gamers wanting ethics in games journalism . 
  [ a new hope ] ( / s `` a droid that meets a salvager on a sand world with a secret message to help the rebels who go on to beat the empire by exploiting a weakness in their planetary destruction device that leads to a fight between an semi untrained force user beating a sith lord in single combat . 
  perhaps as a twist even throwing in a big reveal for the identity of the masked sith lord , you know , to be new and original . '' ),

  get a report a guy has a gun . 
  pull up in the area to ask guy if hes seen anything , guy reaches for waist , gun visible , grabs gun , gets shot . 
  the video even pauses and highlights it . 
  unlike people running away and being shot in the back , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mscftesykyu&amp;feature=youtu.be ) looks less than a second away from death for the officers if they dont act . 
  if it was a real gun , they would have been less then a second away from dead . 
  the gun had been withdrawn from waist and was being raised . 
  if i was the officer , id have fired .

  hey girl , you single ? 
  was n't revived , was replicated as a copy . 
  changing genders , droid shape and who was related to the sith lord just was n't enough . 
  they realized this fan made film would raise the bar too high . 
  all i see is luke skywalker and r2d2 :(, 
  i think the germans should intervene . 
  only 1 % of the world population was able to press it , if you failed to press , you lost . 
  how can you be sure ? 
  is there any evidence other than words ? 
  a single atom in a grain of sand represents those who pressed while they were alive , the rest of the atoms in the universe represents those who did n't , were n't born , or were already dead . 
  you are the latter .

  id make a character that has existed throughout the doctors timeline and has met every face , then when that character meets multiple doctors all together in a the tower of london when asked if she remembers one of them reply with `` a bit '', 
  check out supergirl . 
  dr who writing staff would make it something like that . 
  the focus of the character would be being female rather than an interesting character who happens to be female . 
  reddit admins are the worst :(, 
  never grew into it .
