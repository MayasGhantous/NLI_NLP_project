  voice your concerns without imposing them over the rights of the general public . 
  picket town hall or a park or your local mp 's office . 
  it runs too slow for my tastes , however i have added an emergent australia and colonial regions without impacting performance without too much effort . 
  they also have gillard as pm and for some reason gave her a 4 in administration :(, 
   they get tons of good leaders , no regencies . 
  not having an adult heir and being reduced to 20 legitimacy is absolutely murderous . 
  jackals and vultures for life . 
  i ca n't criticize frank forde , there was not a single policy he implimented that anyone had any objection to !, 
  do whatever you want in life as long as it does n't negatively effect others . 
  should the kkk or the national man boy love association be allowed to block roads to `` disrupt peoples daily routine '' ? 
  that 's really the definition of public nuisance . 
  obviously i support your right to protest but i think in this instance the power to move people on with greater legislative consequences than that of the ppra could be abused . 
  the same way `` disorderly conduct '' or `` public nuisance '' could be abused . 
  you 'll still have your day in court , and unless you 're a serial offender it will be at most a fine . 
  edit : a quick legislation search in qld showed the summary of the protest already being in force . 
  section 48 direction may be given to person, 
  however , a police officer must not give a direction under, 
  subsection ( 1 ) that interferes with a person 's right of peaceful, 
  assembly unless it is reasonably necessary in the interests, 
  ( a ) public safety ; or, 
  ( b ) public order ; or, 
  ( c ) the protection of the rights and freedoms of other, 
  persons . 
  major = yes, 
  potential = { tag = tur exists = mam }, 
  allow = {, 
  tag = tur, 
  every_owned_province = {, 
  controller = tur, 
  effect = {, 
  mam = { every_owned_province = { add_core = tur cede_province = tur } }, 
  paste this into any file in the decisions folder , preferably a new file so you can delete it later as it 's a touch op :p, 
  page 86 of the qld police powers and responsibilities act already allows police to move people on whom are obstructing another persons use of a public place . 
  it already has penalties associated with not complying . 
  a magistrate will never jail a first time offender if this is the sole offence ( due to adequate existing tort law ), 
  tbh if the protest was about actual freedoms being revoked , id be there . 
  but this alleged protest really just vexatious criticism . 
  people who prelude a question with `` can i ask a question '', 
  him : i dropped out when i was 17 , but i got my ged . 
  i just ... thought you should know, 
  you : do n't ever scare me like that again . 
  him : * thinking * well , better wait before dropping the whole murderer thing on her .

  i like this one from `` the guardian '' currently front page on this sub . 
  suprized they did n't draw a moustache and top hat on him too . 
  i accept certain papers have a bias and read ( often do n't read ) their propaganda articles with cynicism .

  no cb war mali , take de jure jolof . 
  annex jolof , you now have cores/next to a western country . 
  use this method for getting into america too !, 
  as ming specifically , i actually liked the eunuch faction . 
  diplo vassalize/vassalize as much as you can to india . 
  with super low revolt risk and high tollerance , you can sit around overextended without too much trouble . 
  this allows you to take half korea in one war , and vassalize in the second war , then sell back his lands you didnt core to then annex . 
  i streamed it yesterday at twitch.tv / fashbinder, 
  you are setting capital twice in the effect field , but that wont make it not appear . 
  you are also misusing the or = { condition }, 
  not = { exists = egy }, 
  owns = 359, 
  primary_culture = al_misr_arabic, 
  this would allow any al misir arabic or any nation that owns 359 to see this decision . 
  potential has to be true ( all requirements met ) for it to show up at all . 
  try having no potential , if it still does n't show up it 's indicating you have a bracket problem or you have n't actually put it into the decisions folder . 
  that might troubleshoot the problem a little . 
  downvoted for karma whoring !, 
  the coring cost/time/ae just forces everyone to play the `` take one prov , release emergent as vassal , return cores to emergent '' method of expansion . 
  in 50 years the culture x will be tolerated ( yellow ) . 
  leave the 10 % / 5 % tax for accepted . 
  you 'll get a downvote when i get home from work , or an upvote 20 minutes after i get home from work . 
  you should tell your `` friend '' that it 's no longer cool to wear a peaked hat backwards , especially inside the house .

  the way op expresses herself with thoughts and feelings leads one to infer that it is written by a female . 
  additionally it 's statistically more likely for a female to have a boyfriend than a male . 
  certainly not 100 % but on the balance of probabilities most likely . 
  red name reddit mods get sexually excited when they shadowban someone and they 'll do it at every opportunity . 
  are you also a murderer ? 
  context : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lq4fs7wza, 
  regretably , this is truely the only reason you 'd watch it . 
  bosnia , serbia , walachia , poland , ukrane , moldova , croatia . 
  these guys may have claims/cores on hungry , vassalize them or take a single hungarian province and release them as vassals . 
  declare on hungry , take the claims/return the cores and sell the claim to your vassal . 
  ( with a bit of micro you can ensure your vassal with the claim is the one sieging the province , ceede it to him for lower dip point cost ), 
  repeat until you cant , annex those vassals and then take x provinces off hungry in a war but dont core them . 
  x = the amount of provinces you need to take to ensure he is vassalizable in the next war . 
  endure 5 years of oe instead of 20 years coring , vassalize hungry , sell his cores back , annex him . 
  it 's stupidly retarded , but this is the most effective/efficient way to expand . 
  core times/costs are doing nothing for the game but make you play in a gimmicky gamey way like this . 
  western types cant vassalize chineese/indian anymore , so best hope they all westernize as you wont have the time to core them all . 
  fortunatly some of those indians/chineese look large , so perhaps obtain a province next to them , and hope they westernize so you can do some cheeze annex/release as vassal in a few successive wars . 
  when gay marriage started to get legalized i commented that it would n't be long before people were marrying animals and inanimate objects . 
  i personally have no problem with bestiality or homosexuality , i engage in neither , as i view it as an individuals choice/freedom/liberty and it has no negative effect on me . 
  downvoted for being a homophobe , got angry pm 's and one message from a fanatical christian praising my integrity . 
  * confession bear image *, 
  i really just do n't care what other people do .
