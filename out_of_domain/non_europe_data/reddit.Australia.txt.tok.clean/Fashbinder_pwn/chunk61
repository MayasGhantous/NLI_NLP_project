   using pc dayler 's definition of how twitter users tend to communicate with one another , mr. elliott did not direct a single tweet at ms. guthrie after september 9 , 2012 . 
  regarding ms. reilly , mr. elliott directed only one tweet to @ladysnarksalot after september 1 , 2012 , and , on that occasion , only after ms. reilly disseminated on twitter the scandalous tweet suggesting that mr. elliott was a pedophile . 
  by august 12 , 2012 , ms. guthrie was well aware that mr. elliott had already threatened to commence a lawsuit against ms. guthrie , ms. reilly and paisley rae for libeling him .87 further , ms. guthrie confirmed that mr. elliott had already told her , personally , to stop libeling him on twitter . 
  however , ms. guthrie felt as though she did not have to stop tweeting mr. elliott because :, 
   yeah , but that was groundless , and i was n't libeling him so there was nothing to listen to or respect about that statement .88, 
  that is all . 
  he then reported it . 
  screencap of him sending multiple messages to admins trying to get rekful banned from twitch makes him hearthstones biggest scumbag imo . 
  the kicker was , when he asked one of them to stop libeling him as a pedophile , they said `` no , im not stopping '', 
  i feel like you are trying to kill me . 
  im calling the police !, 
  i never get the boobs :(, 
  do not touch my penis !,
