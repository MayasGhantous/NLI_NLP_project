  i recall this as well . 
  ps : you filthy casual https://gyazo.com/d9e6f5dab3d4f2029a7208753e95f298, 
  i for one wont vilify people for looking at cartoons .

  its a vocal representation of the data obtained when asking any american about any us election . 
  no no , confirmed danish . 
  i believe its an error . 
  i think he just confused his country with one of the other scandinavian ones . 
  ahh , i had only heard of it happening once before .

  no , they 're just being gaylord cuck faggots afaik . 
  but you should join and steal peoples iron and if you get caught , throw meat on the ground , dont respond in chat and run away . 
  how many say lincoln 's death affected their lives ? 
  super subjective non relevant gossip should n't be included in these kinds of reports . 
   unusual , unpredictable and frightening things happening . 
  makes it really hard to point a finger and say with certainty,

   how can you fix centuries of oppression ? 
  give a new generation equal opportunity . 
  buy the $ 33 one elsewhere and send it back to them pogchamp, 
  is that griefing or just a passionate builder who likes to make small houses ? 
  sorry for not conforming to your playstyle . 
  keepo, 
  which group/religion/nationality from the creation of the universe to 1500ad didnt rape , torture , `` murder '' and rape again when sacking a city ? 
  what happened to her website ? 
  was n't it tubgirl.com ? 
  i am destiny 's dragonball saga buddy , because we played a mud 10 years ago it means we are tight , but also on the ck2 got dev team . 
  would help for ouo combos . 
  the exception is a threat with the `` real and present '' ability to carry out that threat . 
  then it 's common assault and you are `` justified '' under defences to common assault in the criminal code . 
  words in quotation marks are in reference to their legal term . 
  im sure there 's a queer american state that tries to pull cuck bullshit but for the most part every western country will have a very similar criminal code . 
  [ here 's a fancy non technical version for my states criminal code . 
  ] ( http://www.legalaid.qld.gov.au/files/assets/public/publications/practitioners-and-service-providers/chapter-5-specific-offences-under-the-criminal-code-more-commonly-dealt-with-and-defences.pdf ), 
  first thing to note is 5-1 . 
  find out if a threat is assault :, 
  `` threatens to apply force of any kind to the person of another without the other person 's consent , under such circumstances that, 
  the person making the attempt or threat has actually or apparently a present ability to effect the person 's purpose , is said to assault that other person , and the act is called an assault ' . '', 
  from there head to defences 5-12 :, 
  `` reasonably necessary to make effectual defence against the assault , if the force used is not intended , and is not such as is likely , to cause death or grievous bodily harm ' '', 
  as for tort law , i did a quick google and the very first link i clicked did n't lead me to a case where someone punched someone for making a threat and was aquited so i 've called it quits but im sure if you really look it wont be too hard as it 's pretty clearly defined in legislation . 
  might even be hard to find as there isnt the need for case law on something this clear . 
  tldr they 're the same person but one killed their kin and the other didnt,

  how to get in on these nice memes ? 
  i have all of the dlc . 
  cant i just be one of the autists who need reminding right before ? 
  i have a sneaking suspicion that this video has been altered in some manner ... : thinking :, 
  any person going into any country at any time is not a human right . 
  trump ran a campaign that criticised the un 's use of us funding and military . 
  non american here , im ok with a country controlling who enters it 's borders .

  dirty aus twitch server ruining vods, 
  include the other meme spam subs too but nah , got ta carry on this circlejerk . 
  but even without the / s. 
  you do make a good point . 
  im not sure how blocking roads at all is legal . 
  when you do it you are denying others the right of use of public facilities . 
  i think protests should just be restricted to a park/city hall and dont think people being upset about x issue gives them the right to harass others going about their daily lives . 
  have you never encountered a nice meme before ? 
  you 're a pussy . 
  the same gap appears for people over 50 or people just graduating . 
  similarly there 's a gap between people who get a job with x degree in y field if the company they work for is in the public or private sector . 
  the same pay descrepancy is also present between people that work in cities with the same qualification vs those in rural areas . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.graduatecareers.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/graduate-salaries-report-2015-final1.pdf ), 
  i disagree with this . 
  remember the chineese invasions of ark ? 
  20 people gathering rocks powerlevel someone to 50 and summon a god a few hours after a fresh 1x rate sever, 
  x you cant fight anymore , you job is to 50 points in jumping to get into bases and place kegs, 
  y you will do nothing but craft . 
  nobody but y is allowed to make gear/swords . 
   gives a rare chance for players to create higher quality goods . 
  you do seem to lack common sense with all these `` ideas '', 
  if crafting xp is buffed , one streamer gets 50 viewers to farm 50k stones and sticks and just presses craft and is level 50 in an hour . 
  conan devs learned from arks mistake . 
  dont be a shitter , go kill an emu . 
  i think actualbonel is better than destiny, 
  i 've seen that exact comment word for word already like 10 times this week .
