  i think you should publicly condemn me for being an extremist but privately support me with phrases to the effect of `` every religion has fanatics that take scripture to the extreme . '', 
  have sex with highschool girls , as you ca n't when your older . 
  even the gross ones . 
  til : white men do n't want black babies . 
  should probably post on circlejerk , but i left my wife because when she had a baby it was a girl . 
  im not a girl , therefore it must not be mine !, 
  it 's actually really crazy how women notice differences in peoples hands . 
  could be because men are looking at boobs . 
  to kill a mockingbird just sprang to mind . 
  girls complaining about curious boys with invisibility magic . 
  i 've also enjoyed enforcing peace on electors if they are the aggressor . 
  ally , gift marry the target and you will join the war as the new primary war leader . 
  super easy way to get in there . 
  back when i played , invis armor was detectable up close with footsteps/grass . 
  if a proper admin mode/stat tracking was available the concept could be enacted . 
  100 % every time , the lyrics really hit home and i think most other people feel the same way . 
  when protectorates were introduced , they changed it so that if your tech groups level was 50 % or more better than the target , they wouldnt be technologically advanced enough to vassalize . 
  tech groups are listed here , at some point i saw a pretty graph showing a yes/no box for `` can vassalize '' . 
  dont like noisy yobbos yelling in your ear and spilling drink on you while seated next to someone with a cold ? 
  watch it at home , 
  strong national ideas , chineese tech , shares a border with ming . 
  peasants have always been easily pleased by shiny lights and bouncy red balls followed by a `` you win '' popup . 
  disclaimer : i frequent pcmasterrace, 
  i have no objection to pay ( $ 100 ) for a title , even a sequel , that has $ 100 worth of content . 
  would like a game that feels complete at launch for $ 200 than something that 's patched weekly with dlc every other month . 
  this is what i really want removed from the racial discrimination act :, 
   special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination , provided , however , that such measures do not , as a consequence , lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved . 
  tldr : everyone is equal and should be treated the same , except those who are n't equal , they 'll get special benefits !, 
  i 'll google it in the morning !, 
  trevor chan 's capitalism 2 ( capitalism lab ) has no peer . 
  less interested in flashy pictures or elaborate stories but truely desire a sandbox world with 10 different methods of achieving the same goal . 
  paradox 's eu and ck series do it well too . 
  not talking about game of thrones because one guy had only seen season one . 
  people getting pretty uppity , supposedly im a bad person .

   captain adama, 
  as i understand it , someone in command of more than one ship is an admiral . 
  i wanted to like loadout and even dropped twenty dollars on it , just bashing space or spam rolling while holding lmb did n't appeal to me . 
  it took me a moment to realize it was a glorious troll , then i clicked it ready to alt f4 incase of actual facebook . 
  he 's one of my favourite streamers !, 
  `` so my friend an i were talking about our favourite ... ... '', 
  save yourself a two hour conversation right there !, 
  you can change this in defines . 
  ( as well as if the core/claim/previouslyowned requirement is required ), 
  i personally think this allows vassals to grow without derp feeding as you have to get them to siege the land in a war . 
  ottomans get tripple manpower in religious wars . 
  pretty sure hes a racist too, 
  i too wish i knew . 
  someone who posts it here will get magic internet points from me !, 
  i like having vassals so strong/numerous that i can declare war and watch them win for me :p, 
  it 's also that you 're not actively `` not talking to her '' you are doing it because there is no conversation of substance , purpose or desire to be had . 
  can i have your number ? 
  tattos near/on boobs/vagina . 
  would really like to see you naked , but its partially covered or has a distracting logo near it .

  i downvoted you , will now hide and move on . 
  nothing , just reddit lefties hating . 
  lol , i 'd compare hanson to latham , abbot to gillard/rudd , and howard to hawke . 
  i lol 'd when i read this , thinking you were trolling , but +10 for real :p, 
  grats , i 've been trying to do the same but i can never find someone who specializes in dealing with severe procrastinators , but i 'll do it soon . 
  i 'll leave this here now and edit it later with a witty reply . 
  you are able to stop them after a monthly tick or two and resend them where you want them . 
  eg blue retreat line turns into yellow movement line . 
   if that guy does n't leave right the fuck now he will break his face . 
   he went walking around , touching little girls , squeezing their buts , putting his hand on their breasts and between their legs . 
  y no smash face immediatly ? 
  i liked the goat sim review . 
  i thought it was accurate ; re : physics sim needs working world . 
  most of your videos are first impressions/opinions , i 'd like to see you give an in depth review if a game is worth playing . 
  another pro tip in general is to get 4 cores in a colonial region , have a 5th halfway cored/halfway colonized . 
  before the 5th is complete , grab 100 % + overextension from an indian in that region and when the 5th is complete , your new cn will get cores on all provinces in that region , cored or not . 
  leave your troops around to help the cn deal with a few nationalist/religious rebels but it wont be as bad as overextending your cn, 
  i recently streamed an vef england game . 
  scotland had a 2 star leader 2/4/2 and it was a nightmare . 
  remember the ai always has generals ( ruler/heir/standard general/free ai general and i cant imagine he was n't using one to attack . 
  recheck , the leader as im sure it exists . 
  i used mercs to deplete his manpower then carpeted . 
  his 4 shock leader would murder me early on . 
  similarly , using boats to blockade/siege island provinces allows you to get his exhaustion ticking , causing weaker troops in terms of morale . 
  annex him as they 're your cores and in the same culture group so you pay no ae/oe and dont contribute to the province cap . 
  remember , english kings should never bow before a french king without his crown on , 
  i think / u/sephenstorm should be shadowbanned . 
  he killed my father and raped my mother !, 
  i concur with king dan , trapping them on the island would be lolz :p, 
  tbh was n't a threat . 
  leaving someone a suprise is an insinuation . 
  a threat would be `` i will commit crime x '', 
  what new species will we call it if human is unsuitable .
