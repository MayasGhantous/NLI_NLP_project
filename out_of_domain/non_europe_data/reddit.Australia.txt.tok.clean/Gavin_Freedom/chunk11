  he 's a poet and he did n't even know that he was one ... wait ... 
  there 's something about a room full of people cheering like that that just gives me goose bumps . 
  i am now inside my wall ... 
  oh my , i have n't seen you for a while . 
  rooster teeth !, 
  i ca n't link it , but iirc , mud and blood 2 is pretty fun . 
  i can dislocate my thumb . 
  i might post a picture of it when i get the time . 
  netflix, 
  haha , as a fellow aussie , this took me a few re-reads to comprehend . 
  gets me every time, 
  pretty sure the male gets in trouble for it . 
  the beauty of living in australia , land of the free . 
  last time i shoved a burrito up my arse , i did n't shit for a week . 
  you really should have just stayed quiet and played along ... 
  haha , that subreddit is one of the cringiest subreddits i have ever seen . 
  [ there are even finger settings ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/438325077486805014/5bb0d879f1f29aec5d8a54b91ce023f97a94ae20/ ), 
  i dont eeven no wot dis post ses, 
  people think he 's hot ? 
  my pants . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ most ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ time, 
  i 'm a cowboy !!, 
  you ca n't have a kid if you 're not getting laid, 
  you look like [ nadeshot ] ( http://cod.esportspedia.com/w/images/6/62/nadeshoth.jpg ), 
  fuck man , at around 3:55 you can see someone jumping out of a window ... 
  thanks, 
  i do n't know man , napoleon is a pretty good game , just as long as you get darthmod for it . 
  unpopular opinion , but i think that unity was a fantastic game . 
  the only downside was that you could n't start riots like they showed in a gameplay trailer . 
  still not evidence which has been recorded on video or anything , but there is this :, 
  my friend 's head came to rest face up , and ( from my angle ) upside-down . 
  as i watched , his mouth opened and closed no less than two times . 
  the facial expressions he displayed were first of shock or confusion , followed by terror or grief . 
  i can not exaggerate and say that he was looking all around , but he did display ocular movement in that his eyes moved from me , to his body , and back to me . 
  he had direct eye contact with me when his eyes took on a hazy , absent expression . 
  and he was dead . 
  [ got it from this page ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/lucid-decapitation ), 
  still not sufficient evidence , but it is still pretty damned interesting . 
  actually , the chicken can still survive if you cut the head off a little bit too high . 
  [ here is a cool little story ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/running-ponies/meet-miracle-mike-the-chicken-who-lived-for-18-months-without-his-head/ ), 
  yes , let 's insult a whole country for something that the generation before theirs did . 
  that 's like blaming german people today for what the nazi 's did . 
  well , they are ... their skin tone is extremely similar to an african american , who is considered black . 
  so , basically reddit ? 
  `` evolution is false '', 
  `` god made the earth '', 
  `` why are n't monkeys turning into humans ? '', 
  all of these statements are selfish and close minded . 
  it would seem that people disagree with me ... 
  had to make sure this was n't in / r/subredditsimulator, 
  you 're a grown woman , make your own choices . 
  do n't let others judge you for being a normal human being . 
  i usually say `` why did the chicken cross the road ? '', 
  and i will come up with a random punchline . 
  especially drop bears . 
  just need to put some vegemite behind your ears to protect yourself . 
  people from countries other than america ? 
  edit : alright , so because i am being downvoted , just in case some of you uneducated people do n't know , america is n't the only country in the world , therefore , some other countries do things differently , such as australia , where we drive on the * left * hand side of the road . 
  amazing , is n't it ? 
  most of the top posts are n't even dad 's saving their kids . 
  shit , most of them do n't even have a kid in the gif , the poster just puts `` dad '' in the title . 
  haha , that is so evil and yet hilarious at the same time :p, 
  and make sure you do n't wear the nuvaring like a bracelet , otherwise you will still get pregnant . 
  yeah , i realised that after i posted my comment, 
  that 's why i liked it, 
  i have friends who will sit in front of a tv all day watching cricket ... fucking cricket !, 
  haha , i ca n't stop laughing, 
  i 'm pretty sure if you lock the mass on an object , you can scale it up to as big as you want , and it wont explode . 
  ** this ** is the moment reddit has been waiting for . 
  our hero has returned , and with him , he brings us great honor !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ photos ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ butt ^ ^ ^ ^ cracks, 
  i was in year 6 in primary school , and my friends and i were playing a game called `` down ball '' . 
  anyway , i went off to the toilet to drop a log , and my mate followed me in because he needed to piss . 
  just as my friend was about to walk out of the toilets , i told him to wait , and just as i was about to ask him to hold my spot in the game , i farted . 
  and then i farted again , and again , and even a few pieces of turd came out . 
  i started laughing uncontrollably , and with every jolt of a giggle , i would fart again . 
  this went on for about 10 seconds , and after an awkward silence with me trying to stiffle my laughter , my mate sort of slowly walks out and we never talked about it again . 
  did n't realise that was science :o, 
  the number 0 rule says that all posts must make an attempt at humor ... 
  this is breaking that rule . 
  eating wet bread . 
  pretty sure it * is * meant to be scary , in order to get your attention ... 
  agreed , abbott was scary as fuck . 
  hopefully malcolm can set things straight . 
  still scary though . 
  so you 're afraid that they will let someone who has a chance at surviving , die , so they can have an even smaller chance at saving another life ? 
  that logic does n't really hold up . 
  if evolution is real , then why are n't monkeys turning into people ? 
  it does n't work like that ... 
  i cringe so hard when i see someone try and eat a spoonful . 
  like , you would n't even do that if you were trying peanut butter or nutella for the first time . 
  as someone who used to make really decent maps , i am so hyped for the new editor . 
  i do n't think that is the point he was trying to make . 
  he was just talking about his own experience . 
  i once saw a porno with an actress who looked like my mum ... that was pretty scary . 
  i thought the gif was buffering . 
  then it ran the second time . 
  why are you being downvoted ? 
  i was 118 kilos about 2 weeks ago . 
  i am now 113 .
