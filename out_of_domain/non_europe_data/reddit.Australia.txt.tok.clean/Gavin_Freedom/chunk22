  ahh okay , went right over my head . 
  have n't read that before . 
  it 's more cringey that you think this is a serious post . 
  not sure why you 're being down voted . 
  i tried playing rome 1 recently , but it 's just not a good looking game . 
  sure , before rome 2 was released , i would have said it was my favourite tw game ( on par with napoleon ) but now days , the game mechanics and graphics just do n't make it a very enjoyable experience for me . 
  this is n't to say that it 's a * bad * game per se , just that it does n't hold up to any of the modern tw games . 
  my dog 's about 12 now , and is starting to go blind and get tumours . 
  i rescued her from the pound when i was 6 years old . 
  i 'm almost 18 now and i ca n't imagine life without her . 
  she 's been with me for almost my whole life . 
  i 'm not sure how long she has left , though i suspect it wo n't be longer than another year , * maybe * 2 , though that 's just me trying to stay positive . 
  funny story about when i got her : she was the skinniest little dog in the pound , and had obviously been abused . 
  i felt so bad for her that i picked her the moment i saw her . 
  my mum kept insisting we get a `` better '' dog , but i insisted we get her . 
  for months after we got her , she would hide and flinch whenever anyone went near her , and would whimper throughout the night . 
  now days she 's an extremely demanding dog , who can only eat wet food because her teeth have all but gone blunt . 
  i 'm gon na miss the old girl when she goes , but i feel like i 've given her the best life i could . 
  yeah , the csgo knife meme, 
  the problem with this is that the animals we 're upset about being killed are endangered species . 
  i 'm personally against hunting deer etc , but as long as it 's controlled and watched closely , which as far as i can tell , it is , then it 's fine . 
  the reason we do n't want elephants and lions being killed is because their numbers are extremely low , and every lion lost is a massive set back to their population . 
  as for the dog eating festival in china , if you any research on it at all , you 'd find out that those dogs are literally skinned alive , and tortured and mutilated before they 're killed . 
  cows pigs and chickens are generally killed `` humanely '' . 
  i say that in quotations because there really is n't a humane way to be killed , only as painless as possible . 
  as for their living conditions , i ca n't argue with that . 
  a lot of the time they 're kept in terrible conditions , which is inexcusable . 
  we have the same toilets as europeans over here in australia . 
  i feel like if your shit is consistently piling up over the water , you may want to change your diet . 
  huh , minus the passing out , that almost sounds like me the other night lol, 
   neither of you are in the wrong, 
  really ? 
  cos i think / u/natty _ barry is in the wrong . 
  what sort of cunt directly tells somebody that something they 've made is bad ? 
  i do n't care if that person is a celebrity or a friend , you do n't say that to somebody . 
  there 's easier ways to let someone know that something they 've worked hard on is `` sub-par '' . 
  calling it the worst thing you 've ever heard is just a prick of a thing to say . 
  yeah i know , came here form r/all , and it 's just a bunch of sad cunts saying they wish she 'd die alone and calling her fat . 
  i 'm not sure what people get out of bullying people on here . 
  i will agree that like 2 comments here made me laugh , but the rest of them are just hateful . 
  i understand man , i was 13 once . 
  if you need this place to get out your anger and edginess , then i guess that 's fine . 
  shit , i meant 9 . 
  my b ', 
  eh , sorry man , i wo n't be spoken to like that by a child . 
  ca n't be bothered replying anymore , as it 's boring the fuck outta me . 
  remember that the main reason people self harm is to * feel * something/get rid of the terrible feelings of depression . 
  as someone who used to burn himself using lighters and what not , i have first hand experience with it . 
  the main thing you can do is speak with them . 
  let them know you care , and make sure they know that you 're ** not ** mad at them for hurting themselves . 
  the one thing that stopped me from getting help for so long was being worried that i 'd be in shit for hurting myself . 
  allow them to speak to you about why they 're doing it . 
  if they do n't want to speak , reassure them that it 's okay . 
  this might help them come out and talk , or they might shut down and not speak with you . 
  do n't push them to speak . 
  if someone does n't want to chat , do n't force them to . 
  just let them know you 're there for them , and go do your own thing for a bit . 
  if you 're truly worried about their well-being i.e suicidal thoughts/actions , then you may want to contact the local hospital . 
  only do this if it is your only option . 
  this does n't mean to call them if the child does n't open up , * only * do it if you need to . 
  depression 's a weird thing , and plenty of things contribute to it . 
  pushing someone with depression into a hospital can have devastating effects , and should ** only ** be used as a final option . 
  not due to his death i hope :o, 
  i ca n't get it on netflix , as i 'm form australia : /, 
  i do n't like pirating , especially a show i truly love , but it 's the only way i can watch it, 
  it costs like $ 50 ( $ 30 usd ) per season here in australia . 
  i do n't have the money to buy each season . 
  also , if i 'm paying the same amount of money as you are for the same service , yet i 'm not allowed to view it in my country , how does that make me a cheap bastard ? 
  does n't work anymore . 
  they 've blocked most of them now . 
  not to mention , what 's the difference between doing this and downloading it ? 
  clearly not , considering pretty much everyone is saying the same thing, 
  i thought it was a 3 month fling , until bob mysteriously vanished one day , and linda bought 4 tubs of acid and a clean up crew ... 
  i remember when i first learned of minecraft , i binge watched bluexephos ' `` shadow of israphel . 
  i miss those days :(, 
  as an australian , i have never seen snow in real life : /, 
  i thought this was going another direction from that first sentence ... 
  i do n't really care that the guy was shot . 
  he still deserves to be jailed for assaulting a restrained man who was no longer a threat . 
  obviously he should get the lightest punishment possible , but you ca n't go attacking people who are in police custody and expect to get away with it . 
  edit : you can downvote me all you want . 
  this is brutality and assault on the part of the american . 
  if this guy was a police officer who 'd been in the same scenario , you 'd be up in arms about police brutality . 
  bunch of hypocrites . 
  sure , banning him from the country seems fair . 
  however , he should obviously be kept in jail until court . 
  whether that 's a few days or weeks , i do n't know . 
  i 've always wondered if / r/the _ donald was actually serious . 
  it seems like it 's a place for edgy teens to post memes and bully people . 
  i actually had an interaction with a r/the _ donald poster on reddit a few days ago . 
  [ he seemed like a very smart individual . 
  the subreddits he tended to comment on also seemed like they were very intellectual , and were obviously made to spread joy and information . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hittablefaces/comments/5lg1mg/this_buzzfeed_writer/dbx13ir/?context=10000 ), 
  iceland has a very interesting accent ... 
  i always try to explain this to people , but i end up getting downvoted : /, 
  but we did n't have the internet when bread was invented . 
  in these days , we have everything archived . 
  people in the future do n't need to make guesses and assumptions about us , because literally everything about us is on the internet . 
  this belongs in r/gifs . 
  seems more like a karma haww here,
