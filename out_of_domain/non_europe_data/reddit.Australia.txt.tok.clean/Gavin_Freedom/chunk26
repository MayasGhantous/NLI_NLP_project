  it 's annoying that it 's taken this long to get it though . 
  no , i 'm talking being kicked for team kills . 
  i 'm not sure what it is with rs2 , but tl 's are being kicked for tk 's way more often . 
  you 've obviously never tled before . 
  no matter how far away from friendlies you call in arty , a friendly will run into it . 
  i know how to tl , what i 'm saying is that people are routinely getting session banned for tk 's , because there is always at least 1 or 2 people who run into the arty . 
  the birth of a reddit meme, 
  i know that the devs browse this subreddit , and i honestly do n't know where else to send it . 
  i have n't played on an xbox for years . 
  may as well try my luck now . 
  i mean , he was making a joke ... 
  i do n't support hillary or donald , and honestly think both of them would/do make terrible presidents , so what i want to ask as someone who is really not on any side here , is why are people banned from this subreddit for discussing their point of view ? 
  you do n't see that in any other large political subs , yet it is rampant here . 
  you call reddit an extremely left leaning site , and yet the subreddit that i think of when censored speech is mentioned is / r/the _ donald, 
  i mean , the only 2 options are blind pick and ranked . 
  i do n't like playing ranked , because people always seem to get mad at any minor screw ups , which just completely ruins my experience . 
  i 'd rather play with the odd arsehole every few games over the constant flaming in ranked . 
  that 's people down voting the opinion . 
  i do n't agree with it , and i think the people who down vote the comments that are coming from a genuine point of view , and not just someone calling everyone a bunch of `` cucks '' , are a bunch of idiots who do n't deserve to voice their own opinion ... 
  but , people are n't being banned from political subs for being donald trump supporters . 
  any subreddit that does ban people for their political views is a subreddit that is not worthy of being called a political sub ( same goes for this one . 
  you ca n't deny people are being banned from this subreddit for questioning anything the president does ) . 
  eh , i always apologise in advance , and any time i see a friendly killed by my arty , i 'll apologise for it . 
  thing is , either not enough people are forgiving , or forgives do n't do anything in this game . 
  yeah , i will admit , the problem is n't just in / r/the _ donald , it is reddit wide . 
  i just find it extremely creepy and unhealthy to blindly follow and praise someone without questioning anything they say , especially when it 's someone in such a powerful position . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  i used to jump into the sl role back on ro2 every now and again , and the challenge of trying to stay alive while spawning your squad as close to the point as possible was one of my favourite aspects of the game ( just behind gunning people down with the mg42 :p ) . 
  i 've only gone sl a few times on either side in rs2 , and it 's extremely dull . 
  it feels like you 're one of the normal infantry , and barely effects your play style . 
  i still love the game , and ca n't wait to see it improve with each beta wave , and i hope this is one the aspects that can be improved upon . 
  i honestly had no idea that other server regions had a draft pick . 
  i wonder why oce does n't have it . 
  whenever i bring up the problem with the commander tk limit on this subreddit , people call me a bad commander . 
  it 's amazing the amount of tk 's you 'll get from either idiots , or just bad luck . 
  as soon as people start paying for beta keys , we 're going to have an influx of bots eating up the keys and selling them . 
  do n't make that a thing , please . 
  just be patient . 
  because they were having fun and goofing around at a party ... ? 
  yeah i have , and have also used crystaldisk , however it all comes up fine . 
  windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations . 
  i do n't wan na keep bothering you , so i guess unless you can think of anything else , i can only really thank you and upvote you , so cheers for the help , 
  will do . 
  i got ta sleep now ( somehow the test calmed me down a bit ) . 
  i 'll update the post when i figure out what was causing it . 
  one last question : could the drive that does n't have windows installed really cause windows to stop working ? 
  ahhh righto . 
  thanks for all your help , really calmed my nerves a bit to know that it 's most likely just my hard drive . 
  i 'll do some tests myself , and if i can isolate it to the drive , i guess i will replace it . 
  again man , thanks for the help . 
  it 's really not that mean . 
  it was a funny joke , and if she 's so highly offended by a joke about hillary clinton , she kinda needs to grow up a bit . 
  i was bullied about my name as a child constantly ( it 's the name of a character in pokemon , and rhymes with cock ) . 
  i still hear jokes about it , from friends and strangers , and i just laugh at it . 
  sometimes you need to just laugh at the small things . 
  people making a joke about your name is n't the end of the world . 
  yeah haha . 
  love my name , but it was n't the best name to have as a kid . 
  i mean , once you kind of understand how people work , you come to realise that people are n't usually trying to hurt you . 
  the woman in the screenshot could have very easily just laughed it off . 
  it was a pretty funny way to set up a joke . 
  yeah , i think i 've met 1 person with my name . 
  funnily enough i never actually watched pokemon as a kid . 
  i was actually named after the australian rally driver peter brock . 
  the first time someone asked if i was in pokemon , i did n't know they were talking about . 
  if you feel no empathy for her death , that 's on you . 
  the fact is , a human being has lost their life . 
  she no longer exists . 
  her whole consciousness , and her life is gone . 
  i feel terrible that she 's dead . 
  it may have been her own fault , but that does n't take away from the fact that someone died . 
  shut up dickhead, 
  i mean , it is kinda funny , but they 're still a bunch of wankers . 
  forward operating base . 
  usually . 
  ahh thank you !, 
  i swear , if it is some joke ... 
  how did you spell `` their '' the wrong way 2 different times in the one sentence ? 
  looks like a balloon, 
  ammunition purposes . 
  jj quote ? 
  yeah man , i was watching it all night last night !, 
  wait , hold up . 
  how was any of that episode bad ? 
  i thought the episode was awesome throughout . 
  awesome . 
  i 'm gon na do some tests with our modset , and hopefully everything works fine . 
  thanks for the response . 
  yeah , i just asked because i swear i remember it having its own medical system , which is what prompted me to ask the question . 
  yeah , i crashed about 5 times ( as in , arma froze and would n't close , so the only way to get around it was by restarting my pc ) whenever i loaded into a mission as an odst . 
  if i do n't load in as an odst , it wo n't crash , which is kind of weird . 
   but i ca n't actually recall many instances of it being the case . 
  none , actually . 
   although i think i saw it at least once, 
  make up your mind man !, 
  yeah , that 's what i assumed . 
  i 'm gon na have to test if it will crash if i put a helmet on from out of the arsenal . 
  i hope it does n't . 
  i guess it would n't be too hard to edit the files and disable the hud if that 's the problem .
