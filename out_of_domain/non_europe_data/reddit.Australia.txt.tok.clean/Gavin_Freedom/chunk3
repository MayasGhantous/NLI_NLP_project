  what ? 
  if you 're calling me young , i was n't the kid speaking at the start , haha . 
  the bunyip . 
  pretty sure both are grammatically correct , 
  these people sound like dicks . 
  spec ops : the line . 
  although it has multiple endings , each and every one of them is great . 
  god , i hate it that when i call tony abbot a fucking arsehole cunt , that he has me executed . 
  it really pisses me off . 
  itt : a lot of patriotism . 
  a ** lot ** . 
  i clicked that link expecting a quiet noise . 
  scared the fucking shit out of me . 
  lefty here !, 
  i use my right hand for the mouse , and my right hand for my cock . 
  at the end of that game i chose the [ crazy ptsd ] ( / spoiler ) ending . 
  what 's the difference between paul walker and a computer ? 
  i give a fuck when my computer crashes . 
  i know you , 
  try 30 seconds !, 
  a condom . 
  just imagine pulling it off ... 
  he also did this to civilians , in order to scare away approaching enemies . 
  olfactory reference syndrome . 
  not really my whole life , but for the past 3 and a half years . 
  i am meant to be in year 10 this year , but i have n't been to school since i was half way through year 7 . 
  my life is pretty much over now . 
  seriously , it 's like a living hell . 
  but there ** were ** space battles in battlefront 2 !, 
  remember , you were on a space ship , and there were hangers . 
  in the hangers you could either board a fighter , of stay on the home ship . 
  do n't know why people are downvoting this ? 
  i 'm simply stating that there were space battles in the old battlefront game . 
  a fact that does no harm should never be downvoted : /, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9a1-fxd-hi ), 
  also some of his other songs , which you can find by simply searching `` vitas '' in youtube . 
  sometimes i have to double check / r/creepy posts to make sure it is in that subreddit . 
  ** why the fuck is this in creepy ?!, 
  fucking restore that shit ** . 
  i mean , it 's a terrible sub for terrible people , but you have to admit , some of the jokes are pretty funny . 
  holy shit , even being ( mostly ) anonymous behind a computer screen , i 'd feel fucking terrible insulting someone based on how they look . 
  what horrible fucking people would post on that ? 
  honestly , i personally do n't use an adblocker . 
  i like the people who 's websites i visit to be payed . 
  [ mud and blood 2 ] ( http://www.kongregate.com/games/urbz/mud-and-blood-2 ) . 
  i used to play this game every night after school . 
  whenever i google something about reddit , it comes up with / r/outoftheloop as the first result . 
  so in a way , it is kind of a good thing that people post on there . 
  it 's dead d :, 
  i fucking * love * calamari ... and now i 'm hungry . 
  are they those bugs from `` the bay '' ? 
  dude soup, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinyhltaaxc ), 
  every account on reddit is a bot except you . 
  rip ifly :(, 
  within a month , i have gone from silver 3 to gne . 
  it 's not impossible . 
  some people can just have a really big improvement . 
  edit : not make it to lem , but it is possible to rank up a ton . 
  i 'm typing this the way you hear a bogan talking :, 
  `` oi wen up ta cennalink thasmornin ' , an ' they would n't even gim me me doll check , so oi could n't even buy me ciggies from woolies . '', 
  on a similar note , i had a guy say to me , `` if god is n't real , then why do so many people believe in him ? '', 
  so , was browsing the front page , and this came up . 
  i thought i was in / r/funny . 
  this really is n't creepy . 
  is pka still good ? 
  i quit watching it after wings was kicked off , but i 'd like to get into it again . 
  i think i might start listening to pka again then . 
  i just got really pissed after they kicked wings off . 
  but hey , if the quality of the podcast has increased , then i 'm all in :d, 
  haha , that 's fucking hilarious !, 
  a dummy . 
  a picture of me when i was 13 got leaked on a teamspeak i used to use . 
  it was a terrible picture of me . 
  anyway , people set it as their ts avatar and they 'd poke me saying shit like , `` hey , look at this picture of a pig i have '' , and surprise , it was me . 
  mixed with anxiety and depression , i got close to suicide . 
  that gave me goosebumps . 
  sex . 
  * walks up to friend * `` what 's up dog '' ? 
  i broke my foot when i was 13 because i kicked a cupboard :(, 
  you realise no one here actually wants you here , right ? 
  we just let you sit with us because we feel bad for you . 
  in my opinion , i 'd love to see ( piggy backing on / u/nyanpi ) more work put into virtual reality . 
  imagine if we created a realistic environment for people who have been injured , and are in rehabilitation ? 
  or treating anxiety with it ? 
  perhaps someone who is paralyzed might be able to use this technology , paired with brain sensor technology , to be able to walk in a virtual world ? 
  imagine that , someone who , for them , it is impossible to walk , yet they can still visually experience this in a virtual world . 
  there is obviously more that could be done with this technology , and i 'd love to see them !, 
  make sure to leave your door unlocked all the time . 
  usually if a door is unlocked , it scares us , and we go into a state of shock . 
  after about 5 minutes , we 'll just run away . 
  came here to say this . 
  so , is someone gon na shove it up their butt ? 
  i was banned from a mod for mount and blade called `` nord invasion '' for saying `` hail hikkupz '' . 
  that was pretty weird . 
  when i contacted the mods about it , they said they have a zero tolerance policy on racism ... yeah , i do n't understand it either . 
  we were playing on a server , and we were speaking about our teamspeak , and someone started talking about the guy who owned the server , ( his name was hikkupz ) and so we all said hail hikkupz as a joke . 
  someone on the server reported us , and i got banned . 
  no one else , just me . 
  edit : i went on the forums as well when this happened , and they basically told me they did n't care that i was banned , and that their servers are for playing on , not making jokes , and to pretty much fuck off : / i still have a real grudge against those guys .
