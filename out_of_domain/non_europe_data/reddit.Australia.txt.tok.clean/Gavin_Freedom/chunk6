  the problem is that with animals ( humans included ) , the way they have evolved is n't random at all . 
  think about it this way : you look at a giraffe , what do you see ? 
  you see this magnificent creature with a massive neck . 
  before darwinism , most people might have said something along the lines of , `` that creature has a long neck because god wanted it to be able to eat leaves from trees and protect it from predators '' . 
  the way most people see it now is , `` the giraffe has a long neck because it has evolved over millions of years that way in order to allow it to reach the leaves on tall trees , and to make it harder for animals to attack it . '', 
  my point is , people see things differently when they do n't have the proper knowledge of a subject . 
  the fact that every animal has evolved to be the way it is , is because of their environment . 
  using god to explain these wonderful and incredible facts is just a cop out . 
  sorry if this sounded hostile at all , that 's not my intention . 
  yeah , but if the conditions on earth were n't perfect , we would n't exist , and so we would n't be able to even question our existence , if that makes sense . 
  yeah , but my point was , we did n't need a creator to create this planet . 
  all that was needed was random chance . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  you realise that clouds are made of gas ? 
  you realise that seasons are caused by the earths rotation around the sun ? 
  you realise that sunrises and sunsets are caused by the rotation of the earth ? 
  everything you 're denying is taught to people in bloody kindergarten !, 
  i am going to assume you 're trolling . 
  when the facts are right infront of people , and those people * choose * not to accept those facts , then they should not be exempt from being made fun of . 
  i 'm not a historian/archaeologist , but i 'd assume it would depend on where people lived . 
  for example , a lot of tribes in the amazon ( if any ) do n't / did n't wear shoes . 
  i did n't mean the climate . 
  i meant the culture . 
  the title could have been worded a bit better ... 
  as someone who watches the podcast almost religiously , it makes me happy that i am going to have even easier access to it . 
  ps : podcast needs some more gus , gavin , burnie and barb shows :p, 
  edit : and gus . 
  how fucking rich are you ? 
  i honestly believe that within the next 2000 years , we will have an elaborate religion based on the teachings of gus . 
  or you keep running and let the rest of your team move up behind you , allowing your team to have a chance at taking the site . 
  yes . 
  being an agnostic ( 6.9 on the dawkins scale ) , i murder and rape anyone i see , because i do n't believe in god , thus i have no morals . 
  this ^, 
  seriously ? 
  how old are you ? 
  abstinence only generally means not to have sex before marriage , which i believe is what she pushes for . 
  by her getting pregnant without being married , she 's being a hypocrite . 
  if they 're like me , they 'll probably stay inside and play video games all the time . 
  the world would never be the same again . 
  i honestly have no idea , i was just making an assumption . 
  i will need to do more research on her to know for sure . 
  yeah , but australia would still get pretty fucked up if everyone in aus was like me . 
  look at this comparison . 
  these definitely are n't the same, 
  pssst , i was acting stupid and being sarcastic for my own , and others , amusement . 
  what about a black , jewish chinese cat ? 
  not to nit pick , but the pyramids were built by payed workers . 
  i use these to get to sleep ( i have a special 3mg dosage prescribed to me from the doctor ) . 
  they are n't for idiots . 
  they honestly help people get to sleep . 
  take them at 8 , by the time it 's 10 , you 'll be ready for bed . 
  it 's great for people who have trouble sleeping . 
  that 's not even a swastika ... 
  to be fair , those were probably the last dinos in the world , so technically , it was a genocide . 
  once a cheater , always a cheater . 
  people like you ruin csgo . 
  probably meant that quite literally . 
  probably the landing at gallipoli . 
  making eye contact . 
  whenever i look into someone eyes , i 'm always afraid that ( especially if it 's a woman ) i will look at there chest accidentally . 
  350 hours , about 200 wins , i am only mg2-mge :( ( been bouncing between them no stop ) . 
  i also came from playing competitive cod . 
  how the fuck are you so good ?
