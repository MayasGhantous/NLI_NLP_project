  mate 's internet timed out , he got banned and then about 2 seconds later he joined the game, 
  he was n't vacced . 
  he was banned for dcing ... 
  i 'd say the criminal just has a sense of humor . 
  maybe you * should * spend some time being productive ... looking for a new girl friend . 
  if i upvote a reply , i almost always upvote the parent comment as well . 
  my logic is basically ; the comment never would have happened without the parent comment . 
  that controller compared to and ant would be like us having a controller the size of a desk . 
  being born . 
  him getting knifed is just the icing on the cake . 
  sorry , but what part of this would make people hate you ? 
   what is a non-racist , non-sexist , and non `` hateful '' opinion you have that would make people dislike you ? 
  i think you might have replied to the wrong thread , mate . 
  not sure if this will make people on reddit hate me , but i know that in the real world , it would . 
  i dislike religions , especially islam . 
  from what i can tell , all religions were made up to ;, 
  scare people into following laws/rules , or else they will be punished by god , ( hell ) . 
  people made up religion to make themselves feel better . 
  c. religion is made up to make people do terrible things , ( the crusades , modern day islam , etc. ), 
  religion is one of the most selfish aspects of humans . 
  religion promotes ignorance . 
  people will flat out deny evolution , even if you show them fossil records and a timeline of human evolution . 
  shit man , people even believe that the earth is less than 10 thousand years old . 
  i honestly ca n't keep a straight face when someone tells me that one . 
  my second word is `` sure '' ... 
  mr wonderfull 's surprize, 
  wish i was as good as you, 
  his eyes are always closed, 
  the police should have arrested the arrogant pricks . 
  edit : downvote me all you like , if you saw [ the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bnbwut7lbg ) you 'd agree with me . 
  and do n't even think about telling me it 's freedom of speech . 
  this bullshit is just not on . 
  seems like a cashier died half way through the timeline, 
  hahaha , this game looks great !, 
  just no . 
  this is a [ maple glazed pork roast ] ( http://www.thermador.com/culinary/recipes/48_mapleglazed-pork-roast ), 
  `` g'day mate '' . 
  i thought the story was great , but why could n't the people on the computers just use an ethernet cable ? 
   also , they taste nice . 
  maybe it 's just me , but i ca n't taste mushrooms . 
  when ever i eat them , it 's like i am chewing on a tasteless piece of leather . 
  i have no idea . 
  but all i know is that no matter what , whether i am eating them at home or eating them at a restaurant , they do n't have any flavor . 
  [ original thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/3gyuum/some_csgo_knifes_made_from_plywood/ ), 
  did n't this hit the front page yesterday ? 
  keep in mind that this person does n't believe the fact that dinosaurs existed . 
  not to mention when you spray a guy , you pretty much paint the wall behind him , and end up doing 27 . 
  see , if i did that , the instant i jumped , i would have been one tapped . 
  fuck man , at the end , the dude 's just staring at the camera like `` what the actual fuck just happened '' ? 
  ahh fuck , i did n't realise that this was already posted . 
  [ link to the thread that was posted before this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/3hd3jx/beauty_of_map_balance_video_by_3klikphillips/ ), 
  haha , i fucking love these guys . 
  i have n't seen one of their videos in quite a while . 
  this might be a stupid question , but why are they detonating the same sized bombs in the same area ? 
  are they testing the bombs effects at different altitudes or something ? 
  why do you guys all feel like if you ca n't own a gun , your freedom is being breached ? 
  the cool thing is , the emu is one of the fastest animals in australia , so we usually ride those wherever we go . 
  if we do somehow get caught by something , we usually just wrestle them away from us . 
  seriously though , i live out in the country and have only ever had like 4 browns in my yard . 
  a homestead , or a cattle farm . 
  somewhere in the outback where people live , or they can refer to small aboriginal settlements . 
  i think it might be the way you said it . 
  it all depends on the context . 
  here is when to use it : `` oi damo ya cunt , what are you getting up to this weekend ? '', 
  `` awww , nothin ' aye darren '' . 
  if you call someone a `` right funny cunt '' , it might come off as you being a smart arse . 
  it really depends on the situation , and how well you know the person . 
  fuck him . 
  we are typically racist in a joking way . 
  i know a lot of people of different races , such as indians , aboriginals and asians . 
  we usually all joke around about our own , and other peoples races . 
  sure , you might get someone who is a real racist , but you get them everywhere . 
  i would n't do any of it in public either , just around mates . 
  trust me , you 'll know when you find a real racist . 
  uhhh ... 
  only along the coast . 
  i live in the country , and my property is fairly large , and the house only cost around 200k . 
  also our minimum wage is $ 17 , and healthcare is mostly free . 
  how else are you mean to drink it ? 
  just gon na copy paste what i wrote earlier .

  why not ? 
  only some of us . 
  the majority of our population lives on the eastern coast . 
  we 're lazy . 
  everyone i speak to says they did n't ... 
  i honestly have no idea how he got elected . 
  it does . 
  you need to first spread some margarine/butter on a slice of toast , and then apply a very thin layer of vegemite . 
  by thin , i am talking you can see the bread underneath it . 
  we are allowed to own bolt action rifles , as long as we do a course and get a license . 
  a lot of people in the northern territory do pig hunting . 
  i love spicy foods . 
  in fact , if food does n't burn when i eat it , i do n't like it . 
  nope .
