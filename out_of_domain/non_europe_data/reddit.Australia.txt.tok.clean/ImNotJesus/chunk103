  my job is awesome, 
  you did n't expect spoilers in a thread about movie endings ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that if it 's a function held by the business , it can still be sexual harassment ( ie. , you can get fired for shit you do at the christmas party ), 
  i 'm right behind you . 
  pokemon mmo, 
  looking at your comment history you 're either a 12 year old with a terrible idea for an troll account or a massive , massive douchebag . 
  either way , i do n't like you . 
  edit : well played sir . 
  for those who do n't know , he added ` selling crack and shit out on the streets ' after i replied . 
  that 's why there 's a little asterisk next to his post . 
  check out his post history if you do n't believe me .

  then just go shopping with her . 
  i 'm sure she 'll find it very pleasurable . 
  it 's because your eye is drawn to the more attractive people in any group . 
  more people = more chance of attractive people being present . 
  i just finished a book that touched on this but i ca n't for the life of me remember what it 's called . 
  i said that ? 
  you need aversion therapy from a psychologist to deal with your fear of blood . 
  it 's very common to have phobias but if it 's affecting your life/causing you stress , it 'd be worth talking to someone . 
  aversion therapy can be as short as 3 hours . 
  mr notjesus, 
  i do n't pee in the shower . 
  i pee * into * the shower . 
  when you put your hand down their pants, 
  wrong subreddit, 
  read the title again . 
  `` men of reddit , what is something every man should just ** know ** / do ? '', 
  do they offer rewards though ? 
  25 of the top 25 posts are images . 
  i 've made posts and then deleted them because i think i was being a dick unnecessarily . 
  edit : irony, 
  not wear a condom, 
  yes . 
  my amazing looks , my stunning personality but most of all my incredible humility . 
  at the physiotherapist . 
  he put some machine on and left the room for 20 minutes , handing me a magazine . 
  i was 13 and there were girls in the magazine . 
  worst part was i did n't have any tissues so i had to finish in my own pants . 
  ignore them and walk away . 
  think about what a pathetic person they must be to want to insult a random person . 
  do you respect their opinion or even care what they think ? 
  there 's no point protecting popular speech, 
  this one time , i left a job and acted like an adult . 
  i said goodbye to everyone and realised that if i 'd wanted to leave earlier i could 've and that the right thing to do is just leave politely . 
  i have my reddit friends, 
  i 'm almost certain that i 'm not jesus, 
  i personally use : `` well fuck me sideways with a hammer '', 
  no middle name ? 
  not sure where i got it from, 
  rid that karma train to victory, 
  i can eat stupid amounts of food, 
  i went through a stage when i was 18 where i got so angry at my dad for all the ways he let me down that i did n't speak to him for a year . 
  at some point i realised that if i wanted to be an adult i had to decide that i 'm old enough to define my relationship with him and my expectations . 
  he 's never going to make up for the ways he let me down but at least we can have some sort of relationship now , i just define how close i want to be . 
  try to think about what you want from him now . 
  if the answer is an apology or for him to make up for things in the past , you 're in trouble . 
  if you just want to watch some sport together , make the effort , i 'm sure he 's just as scared to make an effort as you are . 
  do my voice, 
  have you ever wondered what 's inside your bouncy ball ? 
  imagine it was too small to cut but you really , really wanted to know . 
  what you might want to try is throwing it into something so hard that it breaks and you can see the smaller parts . 
  of course , if you only have another bouncy ball because that 's the only thing the same size , you 'd need a way to throw those bouncy balls into each other at a really fast speed . 
  that 's what the lhc does . 
  people who misuse the word irony or start a sentence with ` no offense but . . ' and then proceed to be offensive . 
  stop asking girls at the swingset . 
  it 's creepy, 
  i 'd probably live longer if i lost my sense of taste . 
  it 'd make bacon so much easier to resist . 
  he sounds like a 14 year old girl, 
  over . 
  he 'll use a tunnel to escape . 
  do you mind me asking if it was aversion therapy or straight cbt ? 
  haha nah that 's great . 
  i 'm a psych student ( planning to practice ) so i 'm always curious about people 's experiences . 
  love * and * hate the intro to louie, 
  i 'm not completely sure what you mean sorry . 
  are you asking how the opposite sex respond to different facial features in regards to attraction ? 
  set yourself benchmarks that you have to hit . 
  print them out , stick them on your wall and send a copy to someone that will get angry at you for not finishing them in time . 
  get a glass of water and stick your card in . 
  put the glass in the freezer . 
  before any purchases you need to wait for it to defrost to use it ( note : do n't try and cheat by microwaving it , you 'll mess up the magnetic strip ) . 
  i heard all that from a behavioural econ book ( dan ariely - predictably irrational . 
  it 's brilliant ), 
  so does my `` girlfriend '', 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jr39a/in_case_youre_wondering_why_any_comment_you_make/c2egbvi ) . 
  posts something interesting , lies about where it came from . 
  that 's not a prejudice , it 's a rational argument against them . 
  prejudice implies that it 's not because of particular policy but a dislike of some innate quality of the group that makes your views of them irrational . 
   noun : preconceived opinion not based on reason or experience, 
  i love it !, 
  [ this ] ( http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/ ) website has a lot of great ones ( and some god awful/crazy ones ) . 
  any particular topic you 're interested in ? 
  take out the space before your brackets, 
   and are capable of creating `` false memories . '', 
  not at all disagreeing with you but as a psychology student i feel compelled to point out that adults have a lot of false memories too . 
  is your problem that you 're not strong enough ? 
  my so uses her elbows to get in deeper on my shoulders but just be careful where you 're aiming . 
  there are a couple of items that may or may not contain mould .
