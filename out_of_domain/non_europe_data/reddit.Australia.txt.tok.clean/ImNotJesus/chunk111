  in case anyone is wondering , the reason why hazing happens ( and why it 's effective at what it seeks to achieve ) is that it triggers high levels of cognitive dissonance in the participants - there 's quite a lot of psychology research on it . 
  to explain , our brains do n't like ambivalence and will seek to create cogent stories about what we do and how that meshes with who we are . 
  going through that kind of torture causes the person to intensify their devotion to the fraternity ( if i went through all that to be here , i must ** really ** want to be in this frat ) . 
  study after study has shown that it works too . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm not condoning the behaviour , just thought that since it has been talked about a lot on here some of you would be interested in the psychology behind it . 
  so desperate to know what he said now . 
  one of the original studies on cognitive dissonance blew my mind when i first heard it . 
  here 's a very basic version of it :, 
  a bunch of volunteers were taken for an experiment to do a really , really boring task for ( i think ) 30 minutes . 
  as they were walking out , the person who lead the experiment told them that his assistant had n't turned up and he needed some help . 
  if they agreed , they were asked to tell the next person coming in that it was a fantastic activity and they had lots of fun . 
  they were paid for their involvement , half got a very small amount of money and the other group got a decent amount of pay for 30 minutes of work . 
  after this , the researcher asked the participants to fill out a questionnaire on how much they enjoyed the boring activity . 
  conversely to what we would normally think , the participants were given almost no money reported enjoying the task significantly ** more ** than those who received good remuneration . 
  the idea is , if you 're paid well for the task , you do n't need motivation to lie . 
  if you 're paid like shit , you need to convince yourself it was worth it so the participants unconsciously convinced themselves that they enjoyed it more than they did . 
  tl ; dr our brains are fucking fascinating, 
  * looks at username *, 
  not funny . 
  it 's the same idea . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  would be interested to read . 
  studies show that people are very good at convincing themselves that they 're the exception to the result of a study . 
  well , other people . 
  awesome !, 
  it 's a hannibbal reference, 
  i think you 'd just replied to something of mine in a different post and i wanted it to be someone who would be likely to see it . 
  no because he has absolutely no experience in economics , politics or international relations . 
  none . 
  self-help books are a crock of shit . 
  while i agree that qualitative data is highly important , we ca n't ever forget that quantitative data is the gold standard . 
  not at all , as long as the ideas are backed up by science . 
  most self help books do more harm than good . 
  holy shit and that water looks photoshopped too . 
  hey everyone , this picture is fake . 
  it 's fake guys , call it off . 
  i would be worried that he 'd advise me to bury all my money . 
  that 's horribly wrong . 
  moving towards a punch is a great way to get knocked out . 
  tl ; dr effectively random and random are the same thing unless you 're a god, 
  i 'd argue it 's part of the reason we were so successful . 
  great description . 
  can i just add the words `` in that environment '' at the end ? 
  to explain why you 're being downvoted : gender refers to masculine and feminine characteristics and how they 're seen in that society/culture . 
  so , in terms of op 's question it would impossible to answer because it would depend on the culture . 
  ama request : brad 's roommate . 
  why do you put up with him ? 
  what proof do you have for the heritability of ` notions of femininity and masculinity ' ? 
  have you considered speaking to a professional about the hurt ? 
  it sounds like you 've got some deep feelings to sort through ( do n't we all haha ) and it may help . 
  thanks for your reply , it reminds me why i 'm studying psychology . 
  you probably have n't heard of it, 
  `` but you ca n't prove god/homeopathy/astrology / psychics do n't work/exist '', 
  there 's a [ ted ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html ) talk on it too ( one of my favourites ) . 
  excuse me but does this smell like chloroform to you ? 
  mmm bop, 
  can you say more about that last sentence ? 
  ah okay , i 'm with you know . 
  i love watching some of his talks and just wanted to be sure he was n't misrepresenting the science itself ( even though he is prone to hyperbolic explanations ), 
  ... shit, 
  quick . 
  zoom , enhance . 
   common signs and symptoms of drug addiction :, 
   you 've built up a drug tolerance . 
   you take drugs to avoid or relieve withdrawal symptoms . 
   you 've lost control over your drug use . 
   your life revolves around drug use . 
   you 've abandoned activities you used to enjoy , such as hobbies , sports , and socializing , because of your drug use . 
   you continue to use drugs , despite knowing it 's hurting you . 
  if you swap the word reddit for drug ( s ) ... uh oh, 
  i used to miss mitch heberg . 
  i still do but i used to , too . 
  but does it take more and more reddit to satisfy you ? 
  i ca n't remember what it was , i just remember wishing it was the teenage mutant ninja turtles game on nes, 
  dude . 
  escalator ... escalator . 
  the top two comments for imagine made me weep, 
  i do n't understand what point you 're trying to make . 
  they both acted like tools . 
  avoiding social contact is one sign of depression but it 's impossible to say without more information . 
  how are they trying to screw you over ? 
  the point of the test is to see whether your prior learning means you 're up to a certain standard and clearly you 're not . 
  i 'm sure you can ask to re-sit the test but unless you can pass it , i do n't think you have any recourse . 
  but they were right to do that . 
  you ca n't pass their test because your prior knowledge is n't good enough . 
  i 'm not having a go at you but is n't that kind of the point ? 
  i 've found that it helps me to imagine reading what i 'm writing out loud . 
  if you notice yourself making a slight pause , use a comma . 
  if you end up with a sentence , that just keeps dragging on , and you 're using lots of commas , not knowing if it 's wrong , you should probably try and split it up into a few sentences . 
  another reason to use a comma is if you 're making a list of one , two , three , four or even more items . 
  most mental disorders are complex and difficult to diagnose at the best of times . 
  listing depressive items over the net would be an issue . 
  the big question to ask yourself is ; are your behaviours/thoughts/feelings affecting you negatively by being intrusive/maladaptive/distressing . 
  if yes , then speak to a professional and ask them . 
  do n't get mental health advice over the net . 
  even heroin does not really harm the fetus in early months of gestation . 
  ummm . 
  source please . 
  that really comes down to your definition of irrational and i think that it may not be a useful term to use in this context . 
  perhaps it would help to talk about whether the behaviour is adaptive or maladaptive .
