  it 's simply evolution of a species wherein social contact and cohesion was highly important . 
  sexual enjoyment is much more complicated than rubbing of the genitals . 
  for a second , let 's put aside the obvious answer that masturbation is a proxy for sex and it 's clearly not the same physiologically . 
  sex is an emotional act too . 
  you are being vulnerable . 
  you are sharing something intimate . 
  you are physically and emotionally ( generally ) attracted to the person you 're with . 
  if that were n't the case , sexual orientation would be moot . 
  it may be worth considering how many times you 've spoken to someone and * not * experienced ` thought transmission ' . 
  do you think the amount of times you 've experienced it would be statistically significant or noise in the data ? 
  your friend needs to clean his damn fan, 
  i wo n't know whether or not to agree with this until i see the top comment in a few hours . 
  you accidentally a century, 
  if the entire enjoyment of sex was in how the genitals are rubbed , it would n't make any difference who/what you had intercourse with . 
  as a melbournian i 'd like to agree that more magnets are necessary . 
  however , we do n't need more barbies . 
  that 'll only make us more like sydney . 
  i do n't think that 's considered an abortion . 
  even if it technically is , i do n't think it really answers ops question . 
  from a psychological perspective , it 's impossible for them to forget or not factor the information into their decision . 
  i believe that if what they hear is too big for it not to majorly affect the case then it 's a mistrial . 
  you forgot rope and a rag that smells oddly like chloroform, 
  i also feel the exact same way that you do . 
  okay , everyone else who agrees also reply . 
  i think it will lead to a fascinating discussion .

  i offered him a suggestion about what * may * be happening . 
   if you want to communicate effectively in a subtle manner , pay incredible attention to your body 's positioning in space . 
  watch effective communicators and see how they use their hands , their eyes , and the tone and meter of their voice . 
  you can see this even if they are speaking in a language completely foreign to you . 
  not just that , studies have shown that you 're far more likely to consider a girl attractive if her eyes are dilated because it 's a sign of sexual readiness . 
  we take in an immense amount of information .

  my username seems to be relevant quite often . 
  i 'm an australian and it takes me 4 hours to visit my neighbour 's house . 
  exactly . 
  that stat gets thrown around because the number of people killed by terrorists is very low if you look at it over a long period of time . 
  we all know this . 
  why not look at relevant statistics like cops being hurt , injuries from cops without tasers etc ? 
  quick , use f8 to fix it . 
  not a neurologist but a psych student and here 's an answer based on my level of knowledge , hope it helps :, 
  i 'm not completely certain which part of the process you 're having issues with so i thought i 'd give you a basic outline of the process . 
  the first to remember though , is that your conscious thought is only a very small part of the process . 
  you brain will react to a gun in several ways before you 're even consciously aware you 've seen it . 
  okay , so the first step in the process is perceiving the gun . 
  the gun node ( collection of neural connections ) is connected to all sorts of areas that relate to fear and it 's quickly identified that you should be scared . 
  at this point , signal are sent to ( lots of different areas but in particular ) your prefrontal cortex and your amygdala . 
  the amygdala is an older part of your brain that responds to stimuli by sending out chemicals in response . 
  in this situation , it would want to send out an order quickly to tell your body to prepare for action ( fight/flight ) . 
  conversely , your prefrontal cortex , which is the newest part of our brain , is far more focussed on logic and reason . 
  it will regulate the function of the amygdala if it 's necessary ( for example , it 's only a toy gun ) . 
  ** note ** : i know my exlpanation is n't perfect so if anyone wants to help clarify any of my points , feel free , this is an area i 'm still trying to learn about as much as possible . 
  i think you 're going to need to add some more information to that question . 
  are you talking about how regular exercise decreases overall fatigue ? 
  the correct answer is : you 've posted this in the wrong subreddit . 
  sorry , just to clarify ; are you having an issue with how memory of gun = recognising gun = danger ? 
  kind of but instead of a placebo effect , i 'm concerned with unconscious biases of the participant because of what they believe the experimenter what 's to see or thinks is right . 
  for context : i 'm critically evaluating an experimental desing for an assignment on the correlation between beliefs about risk of disease and drinking habits . 
  i think that it 's too transparent what the experimenter is trying to find out and the participant would expect that the most socially acceptable answer is that they 're ` well behaved ' . 
  ** edit ** : i found what i was looking for . 
  in case anyone else is interested it 's calld the [ social desirability bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_desirability_bias ) . 
  thanks for the answers , it helped me get there . 
  you share 50 % of your genes with your siblings unless you 're monozygotic ( identical ) twins . 
  not sure about the other part of the question sorry . 
  what you 're referring to can be best described by the phrase ` neurons that fire together , wire together ' . 
  our brains change over time ( they 're ` plastic ' ) by creating stronger bonds between two separate ideas . 
  let 's do an example with some made up numbers . 
  let 's say that your brain needs 100 fear points for your amygdala to decide that it needs to prepare you physiologically . 
  now there are all sorts of nodes that will add points to your fear total , based on how strongly they 're associated with danger . 
  let 's say that you 've had lots of experiences where loud noises led to imminent danger . 
  in that case , loud noises might go from being only a few fear points to lots of fear points ( think phobias ) . 
  conversely , if your brain has consistently been presented with loud noises that did n't lead to fear , it will associate loud noise with no fear . 
  now let 's go back to guns . 
  your gun node will be linked to danger because when you 've seen it presented it has always been paired with danger . 
  not only that but gun may trigger your home invasion node or your loud noises node or your predator node etc. 
  all of these other nodes are linked to danger too and you 're receiving signals from all sorts of areas that is lighting up your danger node like crazy . 
  now , you 're brain knows what to do when the danger node goes off because we 've evolved to want to avoid danger . 
  it 's going to send signals to your amygdala but it 's also going to light up associated nodes like running or looking around or whatever . 
  this might all seem like a slow process but your brain can do all of that in fractions of a second . 
  dat as ... oh my god, 
  in what way ? 
  clearly not every set of siblings shares 50 % of their dna . 
  it would vary from set to set so any other answer would be useless . 
  it also implies that the present should be more important than the past and this is being ignored by focussing on the past * . 
  well , they 're basing it on the idea that you wo n't be as equipped to do as good a job because of his qualifications and/or because a person with qualifications can earn more elsewhere . 
  it 's fairly common and it 's not necessarily unfair . 
  it 's a badly worded phrase but you 're incorrect when you say it does n't mean anything .
