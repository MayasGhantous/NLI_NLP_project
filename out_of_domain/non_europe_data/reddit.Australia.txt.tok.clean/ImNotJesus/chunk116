  while this is a common theory , there is not a scientific consensus on the purpose of dreaming . 
  for those who are n't aware , this is partially based on freud 's theories of dreaming and not scientifically accepted . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure what you 're asking here . 
  if you 're asking whether a theory of the universe starting precludes the existence of a god then you 're not asking quite the right question . 
  it will always fail occham 's razor because it adds another unnecessary step in the process . 
  which is more likely , the big bang occurred via the natural forces in the universe or that god created the natural forces in the universe that caused the big bang ? 
  this is all assuming that we 're talking about religious belief that does n't simply deny science ( another non-starter ) . 
  the point is this ; from a scientific perspective , god does n't exist . 
  you ca n't prove the non-existence of something but you can show that there is no evidence for it and that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence . 
  now , if you 're asking why religion still exists when there is abundant scientific knowledge that explains what religion used to , well that 's a far more interesting question . 
  while i do love a good harry potter pun , i would n't call it the * best * headline . 
  that being said , she really did look magical . 
  when you pee , you 're flushing out your waste product . 
  part of the process of doing this is flushing out the extra water that your body took on through eating and drinking . 
  the part of your urine that is waste product is yellow/orange/brown depending on what waste it is . 
  the water dilutes that colour making it look paler . 
  tl ; dr pale pee = better hydration, 
  tagging is a big part of it . 
  that 's why gangs will spray paint their gang signs , it 's kind of like saying `` this is our area , if you come into it there will be issues '' . 
  the reason that it 's important to them is that it defines where they can/can ' t control the drug trade . 
  you 're kind of right but it 's more general than that . 
  think of it this way , you 're an early human or human predecessor walking around outside . 
  all of a sudden you hear a noise in the bush . 
  at this point you have two options ; assume it 's dangerous and run or assume it 's safe and stay there . 
  even if there is a 90 % chance that it 's safe , you 're better off running because if you 're wrong , you have n't passed on your genes . 
  we 're hardwired to find patterns and be risk averse because that greatly increased our chance of survival . 
  correct . 
  the capsaicin inflames the pain receptors on your tongue causing you to release oxytocin ( hence why it 's pleasurable ) . 
  it was one of them there joke thingamabobs, 
  i upvoted a bunch of threads about it . 
  that fixed it right ? 
  vote # 1 gen jones, 
  that 's right . 
  so if i 'm in gang a and i do a big a on your territory , you 'll either retreat or start a war/retribution for it . 
  this is a great and really important question !, 
  the problem is that it 's very hard to tell . 
  what you 're referring to is ` illusory correlation ' . 
  basically , if you see two events happening together , you often consider it to be a causal relationship ( a causes b ) and not a correlation ( often when a happens , b also happens ) or just a coincidence . 
  a really good example of this is how people take vitamin c when they have a cold . 
  there 's no evidence to suggest that taking vitamin reduces the length or severity of a cold but people take it and a few days later they 're better . 
  in reality , they would have been better at the same time anyway but because of the timing it appeared to be caused . 
  the best way to make sure you 're not falling victim to this is with proper scientific studies ( it 's pretty easy to use google scholar with a bit of practice ) . 
  it 's impossible to know which factor is causing you to get better when you 're sick ( time , resting , medicine , fluid or a combination ) . 
  therefore , the best thing to do is research what you 're taking or only take things approved by drug administrations because it has to pass many tests before they can sell it to you ( note : in most countries homeopathy and other alternative medicines are classed as foods or herbal remedies so they do n't require the same level of testing . 
  do not trust them ) . 
  racist, 
  let 's say that you want to borrow $ 100 from me . 
  i say that it 's fine but each week you do n't pay me back , you owe an extra 10 % . 
  it seems fair to you and you agree . 
  after the first week , you 've made no payments to me so 10 % of $ 100 means you owe me an extra $ 10 . 
  now you owe me $ 110 . 
  another week goes by and you still have n't paid me anything . 
  10 % of the $ 110 ( how much you now owe me ) is $ 11 and you now owe me $ 121 . 
  now , if we 'd made an agreement that you were going to pay me simple interest , you pay $ 10 of the original amount * only * instead of the new amount that you owe me each week . 
  so after the worst week you 'd owe me $ 110 and the second week you 'd owe me $ 120 . 
  the interest payments never change . 
  this does n't sound like a huge difference but when you 're talking about million dollar loans over 30 years , compound interest makes a really big difference . 
  in fact , albert einstein once even said that the most powerful force in the universe was compound interest . 
  the moral of the story is ; do n't take bigger loans than you need to and always pay them off quickly if you can . 
  plus the surgery would be very challenging, 
  1 ) american psychologist 's theories being used by evil people = / = them being responsible . 
  2 ) even if their theories were ostensibly evil it still = / = responsibility for slaughter, 
  3 ) certain psychologists in a country having evil theories = / = evil country, 
  besides that , really cogent argument . 
  i can remember when creepy guys in their basements could n't wait till they turned 18 . 
  ftf . . wait , that 's not fixed at all . 
  you may not realise this but everyone on reddit is a far better , smarter , more moral and attractive person than non-redditors . 
  that 's why if they were politicians they would save the world !, 
  well , that 's what i read on r/politics anyway . 
  wait , hold on a second . 
  your school promised that you would be able to all personally speak to very famous celebrities . 
  did they every actually confirm this with their management * before * the event ? 
  was `` oh nope sorry the girls are busy '' in response to your principal calling up and saying `` look at we did , can you get the girls to say hi ? '', 
  if so , it 's your principals fault . 
  edit : also , it likely had almost nothing to do with them . 
  even if it was already discussed , it is very likely that they did n't even know about it .

  that joke is almost as old as your girlfriend, 
  thank you .

  my most humble apologies . 
  i heard it from my lecturer who specialises in autism and believed it to be true . 
  i did a quick google search and could n't find anything to prove me wrong so i posted it . 
  have my upvote . 
  he 's just hanging out in space . 
  what kind of asshole does n't ? 
  not a question but just wanted to make sure you know that sexual experimentation is n't that uncommon for young boys and is in no way a necessary indication of your sexuality . 
  if it has caused confusion or distress i recommend seeing a professional psychologist to talk it through . 
  if not , well done for being brave enough to tell your story . 
  i hope that it will allow others to realise that there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  that 's so funny !, 
  you did that thing it said in your name !, 
  are you 7 ? 
  if by extraneous you mean a thorough destruction of a psychic then yes , it 's extraneous . 
  as an australian i do n't know whether to side with the commonwealth or the people that gave me the real housewi ...

  agreed . 
  i think the psychic they were talking about is the fraud but the one on the show seemed to genuinely believe .
