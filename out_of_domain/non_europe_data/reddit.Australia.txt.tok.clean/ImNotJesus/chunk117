  that 's only because big pharma made you vaccinate him . 
  lololol big pharma are so evil because they make money and it 's their fault i ca n't smoke weed, 
  i went back in time to create this account and post several times just so i could upvote this today, 
  i do n't know that you can say that with certainty . 
  while you may be right , i would suggest that their iq still would n't be 100 . 
  i ca n't check sources right now because i 'm at work but i did read that it was partially due to the difference in composition of fat types in their breasts . 
  hopefully someone not at work can check and find a source for me . 
  wake up sheeple, 
  to add to some other posters ; i think that there is a strong punitive element to the ` justice ' system . 
  the fact that we even call it the criminal justice system implies a system revolved around crime and punishment as opposed to crime and rehabilitation or crime and removal of danger ( not claiming either is a catchy name haha ) . 
  additionally , i think that given what we know about psychology and neuroscience , the system is clearly outdated ( if you 're interested in that topic - david eagleman , a neuroscientist , does some great talks on reforming the system ) . 
  before we discuss where they come from , it 's important to understand what instincts are . 
  in our own minds , our entire experience is our conscious thought . 
  you are thinking about what you 're reading right now ( hopefully not distracted by thoughts of candy ) . 
  in reality , those thoughts are actually a very small part of what your brain is doing . 
  think of it like this ; your conscious thought is the ceo of a really big corporation . 
  it will give some instructions about long-term goals and when things break down has the ability to see that there are issues but in general it would n't make sense for the ceo to know * everything * that goes on . 
  instincts are what governs virtually all behaviour that is n't instructed by your ceo . 
  as you can imagine , that 's a huge proportion . 
  the reason it 's hard to think about where instincts come from is that our whole experience of our brain is the ceo . 
  as for where instincts come from : all animals need to * do * things to survive . 
  if an animal is born and never moves they will die because their body needs energy to survive . 
  instincts are what gets that baby animal from lying on the ground not moving to trying to find its mother for food . 
  all of the instincts that the animal uses have evolved through natural selection . 
  the instincts that are valuable ( seek mother for food ) survived because the animal with those instincts survived to pass on their genes . 
  the instincts that were n't valuable ( all other animals of the same species including my mother are dangerous ) died out because the animal did n't live long enough to reproduce . 
  all of those instincts are represented in the genetic code passed from generation to generation and ensure the survival of the species . 
  nice try , swell salesman . 
  the flip side is that it also brings publicity to skepticism . 
  i do n't get it . 
  edit : now , i get it . 
  ama request : this kid 's parents and the person from social services assigned to their case . 
  thank you kindly sir . 
  i would suggest that the greater evolutionary value is n't that water is n't disliked but that a bad taste is an indicator of unclean water . 
  credit goes to david eagleman who is a brilliant science communicator , i highly recommend his books/talks . 
  to your second point i would say that understanding neuroscience is one important aspect but it is necessary to add therapy , mindfulness meditation and studying heuristics/cognitive biases and faulty logic as efficacious ways to become a better ceo . 
  jeff ? 
  sounds hot . 
  i 'd do a chick with a walrus moustache . 
  who 's with me guys ? 
  ... guys ? 
  actually , i 'm a broom . 
  irrespective of the exact figures , having state funded education ( or any for that matter ) that does n't teach science , mathematics or english is beyond a joke . 
  i 've also spent time in israel and my experience is that there is a somewhat awe-inspiring tacit acceptance of the way things are done there and a mentality of an embattled people who need to do whatever they can do preserve their homeland/culture . 
  i can understand why it happens in a country that has been at war for so long but it 's quite terrifying .

  you 're an early man , walking around in an area with wild animals . 
  all of a sudden you hear a noise . 
  you have three choices ; do nothing , fight or run away . 
  if you do nothing you 'll get eaten at some point soon . 
  if you run away or fight and win , your genes will survive and be passed on . 
  fear is your body getting right for fight or flight ( running away ) so that you can survive . 
  even if it is , counting is n't * that * difficult, 
  i ca n't go to the protests in jupiter , the gravity ruins my hackeysack games . 
  also worth noting : no-one actually know why it was shut down yet . 
  all we 've seen is a screenshot of the fact that it has been banned , this could 've been done for a bunch of reasons . 
  this is the biggest outrage since my kiddy porn subreddit got banned, 
  exactly why the police are there . 
  you ca n't revel in the fact that you 're being disobedient and then be shocked that the police turn up . 
  that 's like not showering out of protest and getting bent out of shape because you now smell . 
  you said a lot of words but added no value . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  ** you ** think that it 's more important . 
  in fact , in a lot of behavioural sciences if you get over a 0.7 the researcher will have to assess if their measure has too much noise . 
  sorry , i did n't read the part where he made any truth claims about the graphs . 
  where in his dissertation should he have listed the confounders ? 
  wake up sheeple, 
  studying for an important exam and ... 
  okay , i lied . 
  i 'm ** supposed ** to be studying for an important exam but i 'm actually just looking at things on reddit . 
  let me say that on behalf of everyone that i 'm ** shocked ** . 
  ** shocked ** to see up-the-butt_jesus make a joke that we would expect of a 13 year old . 
  that 's what i keep telling people . 
  also , if it 's a popular thread and this is n't posted in the first 2 hours , it will be buried and not seen . 
  the fact that people are upvoting it means people want to see it . 
  get off your collective high horses . 
  it 's big wall street, 
  the million upvote march, 
  do n't choose based on your strengths , choose based on your passions . 
  being good at something gets really boring after 30 years . 
  on the flip side , being passionate about something will make you want to practice and persevere which is the only way to be truly great at something anyway . 
  if you like stealth based games , this looks incredible .

  since i have my 'em otions ' lecture open , studying for tomorrow 's exam i 'll copy you some info from my notes :, 
  there is no agreed definition on what emotions are . 
  however , there are 6 fuzzy categories : love , joy/happiness , sadness , anger , fear , surprise . 
  despite them often being used interchangeably , emotions and feelings are different . 
  emotions : generally they are unconscious psychophysiological response to stimulus that activates positive or negative psychological responses . 
  feelings : the subjective experience of emotions . 
  emotions provide 2 functional benefits :, 
  communicate needs to oneself and to others, 
  communicate how much we care about own needs to oneself and others . 
  ** tl ; dr ** emotions exist to tell you and those around you that something is right/wrong . 
  ** edit : ** sorry for the short and not 100 % on topic answer , i am studying at the moment . 
  if you have follow ups i 'll be happy to answer them in my next break ( coming up shortly ), 
  the process is called [ habituation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habituation ) and it 's very important for the recent research in positive psychology . 
  one famous [ study ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optiontobuy&amp;id=1980-01001-001 ) compared the happiness of participants , half who had become paralysed and the other half had won the lottery , over a long time span . 
  they found that ** both ** groups habituated to their new level of happiness and expectation and were similarly happy . 
  additionally , the ones who won the lottery took less pleasure in mundane things . 
  as to your question of why , i 'll have to speculate somewhat here .
