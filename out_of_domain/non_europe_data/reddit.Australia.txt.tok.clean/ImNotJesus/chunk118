  my suggestion based on the research would be that the habituation goes both ways and that you getting used to eating pizza is an accident of how amazing our brains are at adapting . 
  i would say that the evolutionary advantage of adjusting to your new life as a paraplegic would severely outweigh the disadvantage of taking less joy in pizza . 
  ( not specifically answering your question but is helpful to what you 're trying to achieve ), 
  all children are different and will have different strengths and weaknesses in their learning abilities . 
  one seminal study ( sorry i do n't have the time to find the paper right now but it 's very well known ) looked at children trying to solve difficult puzzles . 
  half of them were told that they had done really well and must be so smart . 
  the other half were told that they they must have tried really hard since the puzzles were so difficult and how great it was that they tried so hard . 
  the children then re-did the puzzles . 
  the ones that were reinforced for achievement did ** far ** worse than those praised for effort and when asked to do extra practice over the next week they did much less ( i can go into the why if you need ) . 
  my point is that if you want your child to be a high achiever that 's great but just make sure your focus is on the method of learning and rewarding perseverance . 
  if you do that , i think your child will learn much better skills and mindset for future achievement than if they learn x concept by y date . 
  while i understand your fear and concern , it would be pretty inappropriate for anyone here to comment on how long they expect him to live . 
  it would be impossible to know based off that information and it would be speculation . 
  if you want to know more , i suggest you talk to his doctor or ask your parents if they know more information . 
  ( i 'm studying psychology not medicine ), 
  i ca n't know what will happen to him but it sounds like your suggestion of spending time with him is the way to go . 
  no matter how much information you get , you ca n't know how/when it 's going to happen but what you * can * know is that you took every chance you had to spend time with him and said goodbye . 
  if you 're having some concerns about how you can do that ( if it 's upsetting you too much ) feel free to pm me and i can try to help you a bit . 
  ( ca n't really explain this one like you 're 5 so feel free to ask follow-ups ), 
  there 's an agreement between the players , owner and the nba itself that every 6 years they 'll review how the money is distributed . 
  this is done because as the league makes more/less money , it becomes more/less fair to keep things the way they are . 
  the current issue is that while the nba itself has grown , many teams have lost money in the last few years . 
  the owners want to change certain rules ( the biggest one being what % of profits are guaranteed to players ) to make sure that they can make money over the next few years . 
  meanwhile , the players feel like they 're doing their part in helping the league grown and should n't have to take a pay cut when basketball is more popular than ever . 
  what this means is that the season ca n't begin until both sides agree on a fair way to share the profits . 
  monday was the deadline where the nba said that if a deal was n't made , there would n't be enough time to organise everything for the season to start on time . 
  for that reason they cancelled the first 2 weeks . 
  you are thinking about what you 're reading right now ( hopefully not distracted by thoughts of candy ) . 
  in reality , those thoughts are actually a very small part of what your brain is doing . 
  think of it like this ; your conscious thought is the ceo of a really big corporation . 
  it will give some instructions about long-term goals and when things break down has the ability to see that there are issues but in general it would n't make sense for the ceo to know everything that goes on . 
  as you practice a behaviour your brain commits less resources to achieving it ( driving home is actually the classic example ) . 
  your brain is still attending to you driving home but it 's no longer important enough to make you think about it consciously . 
  in fact , once your behaviour becomes * really * well practised , it becomes ** harder ** to do if you 're thinking about it . 
  try walking down the hallway thinking about every little movement it takes to move your body . 
  in psychology we say that people are ` cognitive misers ' . 
  that means that your brain will try to find the most efficient way to do things ( this comes with many issues but that 's a topic for another time ) which allows more of your brain 's energy to be focussed on other tasks . 
  no-one knows really . 
  we do n't really have a great operational definition of consciousness , nor do we have a way to measure a minimum amount of it it would take to create conscious thought . 
  fuck you tony abbott . 
  fuck you . 
  i hate to make this about religion but does anyone here genuinely believe he would make this move ( despite such a huge proportion of the country supporting same-sex marriage ) if it were n't for his religious beliefs . 
  what a fucking joke that this man 's personal beliefs get to deny equal rights to people in our country . 
  it 's an outrage . 
  it makes me feel sick to think that we 're denying basic rights to members of our country . 
  also . 
  if you 're not interested downvote the fucking post . 
  i really do n't understand why we need to outlaw them . 
  we have a downvote button . 
  use it and stop bitching . 
  i ca n't imagine that this was an rct due to ethical issues in denying children education . 
  if it was n't i would think that there are a lot of confounders in this study but i ca n't say without reading it . 
  stuff by jonathan haidt is very interesting . 
  he talks about different categories of morality and how that can explain different perspectives on complex issues ( for example , republican v democrat ) . 
  he has a [ ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html ) on it too . 
  also , steven pinker did a great write up for the [ new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13psychology-t.html?pagewanted=all ) . 
  it 's long but he goes through a lot of contemporary thought/research on the topic . 
  his newest book is on the myth of violence . 
  i purchased it two days ago , 
  [ link ] ( http://www.amazon.com/better-angels-our-nature-violence/dp/0670022950 ) . 
  it 's probably also relevant to this topic, 
  except that the only thing we can then conclude is that crime will probably drop for 10 days . 
  based on that data we have ** no ** idea whether or not it will last . 
  even if it was related ( unclear ) it could 've been any number of transient effects like anger at the state . 
  also , if one were to argue in favour of them being closed down , they would say that finding drugs would be harder and therefore a barrier to entry for new users . 
  in that case , a 10 day report means nothing . 
  i 'm not saying that the effect is n't there but 10 days is a tiny amount of data for crime rates and serves only to be used as fodder for unintelligent arguments . 
  kosher meat is meat from specific animals ( split hooves and chew their cud - which basically means grazing animals ) . 
  the process is soaking the meat with water , salting the meat and then rinsing the salt off . 
  all of this must be witnessed by a rabbi . 
  the problem is that the salt draws out all the moisture from the meat make it much less tender . 
  however , thousands of years ago when these rules were invented , it would probably have led to less disease .

  i had the same thing happen except it turned into an abbott and costello sketch, 
  i still do n't understand what an overweight john lithgow has to do with rush limbaugh, 
  getting the petrol in them , now that 's the challenge . 
  he does often read through reddit comments to specifically respond to them . 
  it 's a pretty bad joke, 
  while they 're both very interesting , neither is correct for this case . 
  it 's simply a question of over-generalising the fear response ( same reason you feel anxious when you watch a scary movie ) . 
  our anxieties are designed to over-react instead of under-react because not getting scared enough when you see a tiger was a good way to not pass on your genes . 
  i love how scared the white guy on the right is to put his arm over the black guy 's shoulder,

  what a ludicrous statement , seriously . 
  imagine you 're using a photocopier to make a copy of your lovely drawing because you 're worried about it getting ruined over time . 
  you make a copy and it looks almost identical . 
  there are a couple of little marks but that 's okay because the overall picture is still very clear . 
  you realise though that your copies do n't last very long and you have to keep copying them to make sure you always have one . 
  what you 'll notice though , is though few little marks got copied into the next picture . 
  each time you copy it there are a few more marks . 
  after a while , your copies do n't look much like the original picture . 
  our bodies work kind of like that . 
  our cells need to recreate themselves over time ( it 's called mitosis ) . 
  each time you make a copy though , there 's a small chance that something will go wrong . 
  the more copies you make , the more chances there are . 
  studying for an exam so do n't have time to find you a source but i 've been told that one theory suggests that the genes causing male homosexuality cause increased fertility in the female . 
  i do n't have evidence on hand so do n't take my word for it but since there 's no answers yet thought i 'd throw it in the ring . 
  he 's so great .
