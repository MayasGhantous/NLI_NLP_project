  the worst part is actually that there has been nothing done about it in terms of legislative reform, 
  not an expert but in general australia is pretty progressive about rights and i do n't think this is commonly accepted . 
  there are certainly elements of any community that would condone it but it 's certainly not commonplace . 
  that being said , we still do n't have legalised gay marriage here despite being progressive in many ways, 
  great to hear !, 
  sounds like you 're [ not a big gay guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rxaervhnuu ), 
  trust me , i know how you feel . 
  i overtook my old account with this one in about a week . 
  it 's not as bad as yours but i kind of miss my old one,

  just awesome, 
  maybe vampire babies are born with no arms ? 
  come on , that joke was lame, 
  a wild sister appears, 
  it uses weird incest feelings, 
  it is super effective, 
  a friend just bought mortal kombat from us ebay , not sure how long it took him to find someone who would ship it to him but it is possible . 
  pretty funny if you get the [ reference ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lame ), 
  not sure sorry dude, 
  [ ] ( / ok `` i got to reread that classic , no complaints here '' ), 
  no-one else is going to admit it ? 
  fine ... 
  the perfect crime [ ] ( / awyeah ), 
  not always . 
  a lot of studies use convenience samples . 
  the important thing is then listing it as a potential confounding variable and assessing whether it potentially affected the results . 
  for example , i just wrote a lab report on a false recognition phenomenon . 
  a convenience sample ( our tutorial classes ) were used to replicate previous studies . 
  there 's no evidence that the phenomenon is related to iq and it 's unlikely the fact that we were all university students affects the results . 
  it does n't make the study invalid it 's just important to note it . 
  i read an article recently that using a laptop on your lap all the time reduces your fertility [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/10/3062122.htm ) so now i 'm terrified of * not * using a book . 
  you are right , it 's important to notice . 
  i have n't read the full paper and i would n't be surprised if they recommended future studies use a more general population . 
  maybe he hates hate so he really loves . 
  the dates actually kind of make it worse . 
  the point was n't that he is spamming with concurrent posts , the point is that this guy has made 11 posts on the exact same topic and none have received good karma so clearly people do n't want to see it . 
  tbh i 'm normally of the if you do n't like it downvote it mentality but his lack of learning made me giggle on this occassion . 
  redditor for 11 months , well played sir, 
   it looks as if god took a big dump . 
  i assumed that the wind blew the rods . 
  has anyone here ever seen any pilots going down ? 
  i did not know this,

  i wo n't vote for a socialist president . 
  porta potties are just giving free bathroom visitations to people who wo n't get a job to earn them . 
  i worked hard for my bathroom and i wo n't have people getting a free ride, 
  next you 'll be telling me that a body-builder with no experience in politics and a history of sexual assault can become governor,

  so i 'm reading this rage comic when suddenly i slip , and i start to fall . 
  just falling , ahh ahh , i 'll never forget the terror . 
  when suddenly i realize `` holy shit , imnotjesus , have n't you been smoking peyote for six straight days , and could n't some of this maybe be in your head ? 
  i did n't think his qualifications for being a bodybuilder were eating a bunch of steroids . 
  my point was more that his work before that had nothing to do with politics . 
  i 'm sure it takes a lot of dedication to be lebron james but i 'm not going to support him in a campaign . 
  i said that ? 
  weird , i do n't remember writing that . 
  i do n't think you should be able to walk into a top job based on dedication in a completely unrelated field . 
  i think we would be better off if politicians had * more * experience in other fields but there 's a big difference between not being a career politician and being good at something completely unrelated . 
  and it was . 
  i was totally fine . 
  i 've never even read a rage comic . 
  aww looks like someone 's got a case of the mondays, 
  [ ] ( / son `` you realise that child pornography is illegal , sir ? 
  i 'm going to need to see some i.d '' ), 
  i 'm with you , lesbian porn gets boring, 
  if this is a world where office space references are not met with severe upvoting it 's not a world i want to live in . 
  edit : made it make sense and the guy below me not make sense, 
  no , no man . 
  shit no man . 
  i believe you could get your ass kicked saying something like that man . 
  yeaaaaaaah , i 'm gon na need you to post that on saturday, 
  a lot of people here are giving you advice about what to do about your wife but there 's a very , very important point here . 
  no matter what you never want your daughter to have to feel like she has to choose between her mum and dad . 
  whether you end up divorced or not ; teach your daughter to think for yourself and make sure she still knows that you 'll love her just as much if she wants to be a christian . 
  her happiness will be far more predicated on feeling unconditional love from her father than whether or not she is religious . 
  always remember that . 
  [ ] ( / happy `` then my work here is done '' ), 
  in fact , it has a wonderful message of tolerance . 
  he does n't just impregnate white women , he 's happy to impregnate an asian woman too . 
  this could be the anthem to end racism . 
  1 : the act of removing a vine, 
  the irony of getting `` grammar nazis '' wrong is too much for me . 
  yeh , i know this wo n't relate to everyone 's experience , just thought i 'd post it in case it resonated with anyone else . 
  i actually interpreted the song very differently , presumably moulding it to how i felt . 
  i thought it was about someone who knew they were sad but did n't feel like they had the right to be . 
  i thought it was about someone who was moving forwards but so slowly that it hurt and was too aware of it .

  you hate me but did an inception joke just below me ? 
  [ well played sir ] ( http://stubbornlynaive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/slow-clap.gif ), 
  listen up kiddies . 
  if she 'll let you have sex without a condom , you do n't want to have sex without a condom .
