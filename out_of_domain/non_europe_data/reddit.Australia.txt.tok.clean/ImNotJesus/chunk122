  if this is the case ( and it 's very possible i 'm wrong , i do n't know you well enough to possibly say it with any certainty ) talking to a therapist ( i would think cbt or psychodynamic speciality would be good for you ) may help uncover the underlying psychological process involved . 
  there is a lot of stigma attached to seeing a psychologist but we all have unconscious processes that thwart our happiness and everyone has something to learn . 
  as for immediate advice , do n't pressure yourself to feel a certain way about it . 
  there 's no better way to torture yourself than telling yourself how you should feel . 
  if you feel uncomfortable , that 's okay . 
  sit with the feelings and see what comes up , you may learn a bit about yourself from it .

  pokemon mmo, 
  my sister was just diagnosed with lupus . 
  she did n't think that getting her [ this ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/house-its-never-lupus-t-shirt-hugh-lawrie-/290540764152 ) t-shirt was as funny as i thought it was . 
  we do n't really know what the physical version of a memory is . 
  what we do know is that memories are stored in ` nodes ' of concepts that are linked from one area to another based on the frequency that they fire together . 
  for example , your chocolate node would be closer and have more links to your dessert node than your cat node . 
  we also know that memory is flawed and very much subject to external influences , are easily manipulated and change over time . 
  for those reasons , we can say that memory is n't really like a cd or as simple as `` this chunk of your brain refers to that one experience you had at disneyland '' . 
  it is a complex network that is stored in parts and accessed by patterns of firing as opposed to area a refers to memory x. 
  the same happened in australia a while ago . 
  i have a vague childhood memory of swapping a bag of 2 cent coins at the bank and being very excited by the 40 cents i got for it . 
  ask them if they know what a gene is . 
  if they do , say it 's like a gene but it 's ideas instead . 
  memes are simply ideas that are spread . 
  memetics is the study of how they spread . 
  she was caught off-guard and did n't know what to say . 
  she 's not into you pal , i 'm sorry . 
  my social psych of relationships prof was an attachment researcher and he had us using the adult attachment questionnaire ( aaq , simpson , rholes , & phillips , 1996 ) . 
  our assignment was on how attachment style relates to coping so we used the problem-focused style of coping ( pf-soc , heppner , cook , wright , & johnson , 1995 ) questionnaire . 
  they 're both pretty short and easy . 
  because the same mechanism that gets you addicted to substances is very adaptive . 
  we get addicted to things because they 're good at activating the reward centres of our brain ( dopamine being the most important part ) . 
  reward mechanisms are important because they generally encourage adaptive behaviours ( sex , food , exercise , novelty etc. ), 
  because evolution does n't work like that . 
  we do n't evolve to deal with a specific problem , there 's no guiding hand of evolution . 
  it is better for us to have reward centres that respond to certain stimuli . 
  most highly addictive drugs trick our brain into wanting to reward itself , that 's why they 're addictive . 
  they change our brain chemistry . 
  you do n't just evolve a way to block heroin . 
  also , most of these drugs are very recent . 
  evolution works over a very long period of time . 
  also , in breaking news , taking drug suggestions for serious mental conditions from anonymous strangers is always a good idea . 
  how did your psychiatrist distinguish tss from schizophrenia ? 
  a similar way to do this that i personally use is that i try to imagine that i 'm explaining it to my girlfriend . 
  she has some basic knowledge but because i ca n't assume she knows too much i have to come up with clear and concise ways of explaining it in my head . 
  do n't assume you know it just because you understand it in the moment . 
  my phenomenal modesty, 
  quit . 
  because it relates to biology . 
  get off your high horse . 
  if you do n't think the question has value , do n't read the answers . 
  my position is that free will ( in the way you 've defined it ) probably does n't exist but the illusion of free will is identical to actual free will as you will always act as if you have it . 
  i do n't see where he said that consciousness ca n't be a result of neural circuitry . 
  any proper discussion on free will must accept that point but i do n't think he 's denying it . 
  why ? 
  it 's a stupid point that shows a complete lack of understanding of the question . 
  no-one asked whether one could accurately predict one 's future actions . 
  however , calling someone stupid for asking a question that puzzles philosophers to this day and showing a complete lack of understanding of the subject matter forfeits your right to have any meaningful contribution to the discussion . 
  ha ha that 's so tits, 
  i hate myself, 
  the unpleasantness of the word is mitigated by the pleasantness of the red dwarf memories it invokes . 
  in australia it 's legal to marry a first cousin as long they 're not the same sex as you .

  yeh those asshole 13 year old girls who his music is designed for sure really just like the same music you do . 
  also , fuck that incredibly talented guy for writing making music that does n't appeal to me specifically . 
  you may not like his music , i sure do n't , but you 're a moron if you do n't think he 's incredible at what he does . 
  try not to think of evolution as a journey to a certain place . 
  modern medicine is part of our evolution . 
  we 've invented it because we evolved brains that were capable of inventing it , in the same way that we learned to use tools or even created societal structures . 
  evolution does n't slow down or stop , we are just evolving due to different forces . 
  people still die and some of those people still do n't reproduce and there are still genetic mutations that affect people 's chance reproducing . 
  have n't heard of it sorry but i might be able to put you in the right direction though . 
  any psychopatholgy that involved losing a sense of self comes under the banner of dissociative disorders . 
  wake up sheeple, 
  dae read that as `` life is like pornography . . '' and get very , very confused ? 
  * okay *, 
  no we do n't . 
  also , if you can taste water , it 's fair to assume that you should n't be drinking it . 
  that distinction would probably provide more benefit than water tasting good . 
  you did n't actually explain anything , just gave an example of it . 
  the reason that prisoner 's dilemma is important is that no matter what the other person does , you 're always better off talking . 
  game theory is a way of formalising rules of exchanges to get the best outcome for a , or all , parties . 
  it 's brave, 
  i think you 're going to need a bit more specific . 
  do you mean how does learning work in a neurological sense or are you asking about theories of learning/conditioning or are you just asking for general information in be an effective learner ? 
  to understand the milgram experiments ( there was more than one ) you need to remember that it happened shortly after ww2 . 
  psychologists ( and most people ) were trying to work out how humans could behave in the way the nazis did . 
  milgram 's experiments looked at the part of authority in doing evil . 
  ** how the experiment worked ** :, 
  a participant was showed into a room with a big knob attached to a computer . 
  a research assistant ( wearing a lab coat - this changed in later experiments but it was considered important in the first experiment ) explained that the experiment was on how punishment affected learning . 
  the participant was instructed that they were to ask questions to another participant , through an intercom , who was on the other side of a wall and if the other participant got the answers wrong , they were supposed to use the knob to give them an electric shock . 
  they were also told that each time the answer was wrong , the shock should get stronger . 
  the experiment then began with a confederate ( research assistant pretending to be a participant ) answering questions . 
  if the answer was given wrong , the confederate would scream in pain . 
  in the first experiment 65 % of the participants gave the highest level shock ( marked as 450 volts ) . 
  ** what that means ** :, 
  the reason these results were so significant is that outside of that setting it would be very hard to convince someone to give another person a 450 volt electric shock . 
  milgram believed ( and later experiments supported this ) that the authority of the researcher was the reason that the person was able to do something so unconscionable . 
  to add to this , think about how incredibly dangerous and long pregnancy is for our species . 
  not only that , babies are unable to defend themselves for years and years .
