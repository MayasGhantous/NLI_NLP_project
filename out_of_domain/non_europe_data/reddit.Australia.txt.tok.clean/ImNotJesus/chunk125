  this subreddit is about learning and if it 's an area i know about i want it to be accurate . 
  i 'm sorry if i 've upset you but all i really care about is making sure that the information on this subreddit is accurate . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hghebxhvgg ) a link of neil degrasse tyson debunking it . 
  james bond was written in a day when cocktails did n't really exist and they were basically just combinations of strong alcohols . 
  martinis are actually horrendous and the number of guys that will buy them at a bar , thinking it 's cool , and then horribly regretting it is hilarious . 
  it 's all personal taste , just try to find what you like . 
  i hate pure spirits because i 'd rather not drink fire . 
  i like wine/beer generally but some cocktails are nice ( although some consider them not very manly - i could n't give a fuck ) . 
  my partner is more attractive than me ( no way i 'm posting pics ) . 
  i got her by not caring about the fact that she 's more attractive than i am . 
  grown ups do n't make it a deciding factor . 
  find someone whose personality you like and i promise you 'll find them attractive . 
  what 's happening is a combination of confirmation bias and focussing on the novel . 
  first part of this is that we notice things that stick out because they draw our attention . 
  you 're far more likely to notice the unexpected events than those you expect . 
  what i 'm saying is that you do n't walk by street lights and notice all the ones that * do n't * go out since that 's normal and expected . 
  when one goes out , it 's novel and draws your attention , you notice it . 
  once you began to notice this pattern , confirmation bias starts working . 
  confirmation bias is an innate bias ( that we all have ) that means you are more likely to give attention to or credit things that support your belief and ignore those and do n't support your belief . 
  every time a light goes out , you think to yourself `` see , lights always go out around me '' but again , how often do you walk past them and say `` not out , not out , not out , not out ... '', 
  to be clear , none of that is a critism of you and it 's all completely normal . 
  our brains are flawed when it comes to assessing these sorts of things and that 's why the scientific method is so important . 
  if you really want to test it , get a group of friends to all walk the same route home at the same speed at different times . 
  all do it at each time on different nights and count the number of lights that go out within a certain range . 
  i guarantee you that you 'll find your results are no different to that of your friends ' . 
  if he ca n't keep his eyes open for long , why do n't you load up an ipod with audiobooks/podcasts/music etc so he has some entertainment . 
  he 's probably really , really bored . 
  the 90s, 
  this wo n't really work that well in text but here goes :, 
  knock knock, 
  who 's there ? 
  interrupting cow, 
  interru ... 
  ** mooooo **, 
  genghis khan easily :, 
   many of these invasions resulted in the large-scale slaughter of local populations , which have given genghis khan and his empire a fearsome reputation in local histories . 
  [ 8 ] mongol campaigns may have resulted in the deaths of 40 million people . 
  think about how much less populated areas were back then too . 
  also , apparently he has an insane number of illegitimate children from it . 
  i like that . 
  i can do a pretty good seagull imperssion so i often do that . 
  it 's a remarkably unpleasant noise too so it works great . 
  i do n't always start businesses , but when i do i get legal advice from anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  if that 's your definition then the answer is mixed . 
  a very small amount of brain damage can cause very significant dysfunction if you 're unlucky . 
  on the other hand , brain structure can change over time to compensate for a deficiency or as an adjustment to learning ( depending on the type of both ) . 
  moderator, 
  #### is someone cutting onions and why is it raining oh my god i do n't really mean god it 's just an expression , i 'm really an atheist so i do n't mean god anyway i 'm so proud of your bravery and how sensitive i am , i 'm really so sensitive , anyway your post reminds me of pokemon and that made me happy so i wish i had more than one upvote to give you, 
  talk to the vet not random strangers on the net, 
  as an undergrad psych student a lot of this went over my head . 
  can someone give me a bit of a tl ; dr ? 
  i have no issue with any animal being humanely killed for food as long as they 're not endangered . 
  i do n't think horses are any more special than cows . 
  i think this post has the potential to be interesting, 
  it 's a fair bit creepier if you used to be with her, 
  as someone who grew up in a jewish household , went to a jewish school and lived in a jewish area , i can tell you that `` secular jew '' describes 90 % of jews . 
  just some info for anyone reading this ; the heimlich manoeuvre is actually the incorrect procedure to use . 
  you 're supposed to encourage them to cough or slap them on the back . 
  not having a go at you , just some information for anyone reading this since it 's a common myth . 
  pro : for good or bad , politicians are able to get their message out . 
  they can represent their message as they feels best represents themselves . 
  compassion . 
  we do n't lack smart people or people capable of advancing the world , but there are forces that stop them from working . 
  more compassion = more efficient society . 
  why is n't there a law banning people from selling unproven medicines like homeopathy . 
  it 's a few years old but give it a shot . 
  [ me ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nva_flbxkbq/tvfy-8dzlvi/aaaaaaaaa14/yriwdzpgvky/s1600/old-man-winking.jpg ), 
  it 's called a placebo and people [ die ] ( http://whatstheharm.net/ ) because of being given bad treatments . 
  why ? 
  we have regulations on all sorts of things because they 're potentially damaging . 
  i ca n't sell you a car , saying that it works , if it has a broken engine . 
  even if you do n't say the word ` medicine ' , if you say that it is good for x and it is n't , you should be liable for all the damages those false claims do . 
  the unproven argument does n't work because i 'd win a nobel prize if i proved that homeopathy works because it would overturn a huge chunk of our knowledge . 
  there 's incredible amounts of money in it ( far more than what scientists get through grants ) but study after study has shown that it does n't work . 
  why should we let some asshole with no proof make money off hurting people ? 
  homeopathy has been proven in trial after trial to not work . 
  i do n't have access to journals right now because i 'm at work but there is zero evidence that they do anything beyond the placebo effect . 
  what i was saying is that you were cured by either a placebo or time passing and your illness passing . 
  if it was n't that , you 'd be a medical marvel , being cured by things that would overturn an incredible amount of what we know about science . 
  maybe some common ground there . 
  i 'm happy to let an `` alternative medicine '' salesman sell anything as long as they 're clearly labelled in big letters `` this is not medicine and there is no evidence it will work '' and they make no claims that refer to any disease or health benefit . 
  under those conditions , sure , we do n't need to ban it . 
  great summary , thank you very much , i really appreciate it . 
  further schism between the religious right/alternative medicine crowd etc and those representing science and skepticism . 
  i think the people that are really going to get hurt are the kids born into family where there is immense distrust for ` western medicine ' and the scientific method in general . 
  if a professional thinks you should take them , that evidence should count for far more than what strangers on the internet think . 
  if you 're unsure , get a second professional to tell you . 
  all `` alternative medicines '' and `` health supplements '' have to go through the same fda processes that drugs go through . 
  the complaining about reposts and memes . 
  i 'm sorry oh captain of the internet , but not everyone saw that same thing you did . 
  not everyone is on reddit 24/7 and not everyone sees every post . 
  if it 's on the frontpage or the top comment of a post , clearly enough people enjoyed it to upvote it . 
  your opinion is worth as many upvotes as anyone else . 
  / end rant, 
  [ sees username ], 
  still do n't care, 
  why would you create a law that stops the police doing their job instead of changing the current law ? 
  ** no bias ** . 
  discussion of politics and other controversial topics is allowed and often necessary , but try to remain textbook-level fair to all sides , for both questions and answers . 
  your questions presupposes something that not everyone agrees on .
