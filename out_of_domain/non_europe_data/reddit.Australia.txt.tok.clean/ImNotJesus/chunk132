  for a different audience is literally hitler . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  all people who like comedy should like the exact same type of comedy you do . 
  anyone who makes comedy/music/tv etc. 
  for a different audience is literally hitler . 
  yeh , we might offend the followers of one of the worst tyrants in modern history . 
  what a shame hitch was n't around to see it . 
  i do n't think much would 've made him happier . 
   is there still science being done that helps our ability to intuitively explain everyday phenomena ? 
  psychology !, 
  what 's more fundamental than explaining people 's thoughts and behaviours ? 
  it 's also worth remembering that the vast majority of papers that get published are very , very mundane unless you work in that very specific area . 
  there is limited benefit to me slighting fudging the numbers on my paper if only my colleagues are reading it compared to the damage you can do to your career . 
  conversely , if a paper seems unlikely to be true based on previous findings , a journal may refuse its admission until the study is replicated ( ca n't find a link but this happened a few years ago when a study found a homeopathic treatment to be efficacious . 
  upon replication , it was found that the methodology was very flawed and the numbers could n't be replicated . 
  therefore , the paper was not published ) . 
  i made [ this ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35j91n/ ) just for you !, 
  upside down, 
  a psychology teacher calling someone `` the next einstein '' ? 
  that 's such a depressing misunderstanding of intelligence from someone who should have a basic understanding of it . 
  majority still do . 
  it 's nothing personal , it just feels nice . 
  i ca n't watch the video because i 'm at work but i study psychology and am happy to try and help with the veracity of the claims if you can give me some dot points on what it claims . 
  okay , i 'm already convinced it 's bs then . 
  either way you 're going to need to watch it . 
  why not sit there with a [ taxonomy of logical fallacies ] ( http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html ) and play `` find the bullshit '' . 
  maybe part of the activity is about learning what is and is n't science ? 
  even if it 's not , no reason you ca n't make it that . 
  if it makes any claims you 're not sure about , just message me and i 'll try help you . 
  r/rant or find a therapist who will actually be able to help you, 
  but ... it 's so bright, 
  you think that reading r/politics means you have any idea about politics, 
  by severely limiting the number of productive hours in my day . 
  there are three alternatives that i ca n't possibly choose between without knowing you :, 
  1 ) you lack the ability to empathise and therefore do n't have remorse . 
  2 ) you do n't want to be in a monogamous relationship but you 're too much of a bitch to actually do that honestly . 
  3 ) you 're severely emotionally damaged and incapable of turning down the attention you receive from men . 
  irrespective of which it is , what you 're doing to your husband is terrible . 
  i hope for his sake you tell him . 
  cheat in a relationship or at monopoly, 
   purging guilt is almost always a selfish endeavor . 
  what a load of shit . 
  her husband has the right to know . 
  if you do n't tell them because you think it will hurt them and keep doing it , you 're an insensitive and selfish asshole . 
  i do . 
  it 's a horrible thing to do . 
  the power to teach people to use the search function, 
  meditate and learn breathing exercises or seek professional help . 
  both are scientifically proven to be efficacious . 
  talking to a professional racecar driver that i was spending time with due to a mutual friend . 
  i was trying to impress him so when he started talking about practice i went into a 10 minute speech about neuroplastic experiments that involve imagining practice and how surprisingly efficacious it was . 
  he was n't as impressed by the studies as i was . 
  normally , if they do n't give you a new glass you just pour a little bit of water in the glass and throw it into the spit bucket . 
  this is a good rule but not a great rule . 
  treat others as they * want * to be treated . 
  you may enjoy gentle teasing when you 're hanging out with your friends but another person does n't . 
  if you 're in an emotional situation , take a breath and try to think about why the other person is upset . 
  yeh , in that case you 're better off switching but it 's not catastrophic . 
  just rinse it out with water if you ca n't be bothered . 
  how do you justify it then ? 
  why do you do it ? 
  do you really enjoy the sex that much or is it just for the ` thrill ' ? 
   while i agree that strict monogamy is an unrealistic ideal, 
  i would n't say that at all . 
  cheating on your husband is a pretty good way to make sure of that though . 
  my point is n't to say that you should have an open relationship and i would n't be at all surprised if he left you after you telling him . 
  the fact is though , that if you really love him , you 'll realise how unfair it is to be in a relationship where you have fundamentally different understandings of the rules . 
  i have no judgement if you want to fuck other guys . 
  if you do it and lie to your husband , you 're being selfish and potentially causing him immense pain . 
  that 's what usually happens at wine tastings . 
  if you drink all the wine you end up very , very drunk . 
  meth addiction, 
  obscenely dramatic . 
  it does n't matter who ( religious people , atheists , conservatives , leftists , libertarians ) , everything is life and death . 
  ** if sopa passes that will be the end of democracy forever ** . 
  learn to meditate or find a therapist or both, 
  do you have a favourite technique ? 
  do you use more a thai or dutch style ? 
  favourite knockout ? 
  what 's your favourite breakfast cereal ? 
  go to the police first . 
  tell them what happened from start to finish so you do n't look like you 're hiding anything . 
  in that situation , if you genuinely thought your family were in danger , you did the right thing . 
  if he accuses you first , you 're on the defensive . 
  follow-up question . 
  which is a better movie ; gone with the wind or citizen kane ? 
  as an australian i think half of those things about english people . 
  exactly . 
  he should 've at least said todger, 
  hey , what was that noise ? 
  did anyone else hear something ? 
  kind of like how i 've never , ever heard an australian say `` throw another shrimp on the barbie '' ? 
  7 - i want her to be attractive and feel attractive but also do n't want her to be able to rely on it during high school and not develop any social/scholarly skills . 
  i 'm sure i 've heard it on one of the many awesome panel comedy shows you guys have . 
  as a mainlander , i 'm impressed someone so inbred can type . 
  because there are also huge costs . 
  for example , the size of our brains at birth make giving birth incredibly dangerous ( even with modern medicine we still lose women during childbirth sometimes ) . 
  also , despite 9 months and a difficult birth , we 're relatively under-developed at birth . 
  our brains still have a ** long ** way to go and we 're unable to defend ourselves physically . 
  lastly , consider how much of a toll raising children has .
