  we ca n't have that many children without risking the lives of ones we 've had . 
  a lof of factors had to fall into place to make it possible for humans to be able to handle those negatives and you could argue that , from purely the perspective of number of offspring , we 're pretty poorly designed . 
  yes . 
  our brains are actually plastic , which means that they can change over time . 
  the way our brains change is best summed up by the phrases ; `` neurons that fire together , wire together '' and `` use it or lose it '' . 
  so , for example , if the area of your somatosensory cortex ( the part of your brain that reacts to stimuli ) that is devoted to hearing no longer has neurons firing at it , it will look for something else to wire to . 
  this is an amazingly adaptive and brilliant process . 
  perhaps an easier example to understand is to consider a lifelong pianist . 
  if you 've ever watched one play , you 'll see how incredibly dexterous their fingers are . 
  what happens is , over time , the part of the primary motor cortex ( the movement version of the somatosensory cortex ) gives more and more ` space ' to the body parts that are using it the most and their fingers take up a much larger proportion of the primary motor cortex than it does for most people . 
  so , if you were no longer hearing anything , that spare ` space ' will be taken up by nearby neurons . 
  noah 's ark, 
  i did n't get to bed until 8 last night . 
  i was out all night and only got some under the shirt action . 
  man ... my dealer gave me this new formula . 
  if you 're seriously depressed ( please note that feeling sad is n't the same as suffering from depression ) please see a professional and do n't take medical advice from people over the internet . 
  this is a ** medical ** condition that requires professional treatment . 
  you would n't ask who here has a cancer remedy would you ? 
  anti-depressants work for some people and therapy works for most . 
  go see someone . 
  ps : drugs and alcohol are band-aids that make you feel worse in the long term . 
  anyone genuinely suggesting that knows literally nothing about mental health . 
  ** edit ** : i thoroughly apologise if i appeared to be belittling op for asking the question . 
  while there are small things you can do that are efficacious in helping with a depressed state , it is irresponsible to advise someone on a medical issue over the internet . 
  i 'm sorry but none of you are professionals and none of you have any idea about his condition . 
  there is some value in doing that but seeking professional advice should always be the first stop . 
  `` how to find who 's spying on you '', 
  `` how to bury a body '', 
  please do n't ever talk on behalf of me again . 
  i 'm not denying that . 
  all i said is that if you believe the bible to be true and you do n't ignore the text , homosexuality is clearly forbidden . 
  the part where i called it fantasy probably should 've tipped you off that i 'm not a fan of it . 
  except that if you truly believe the bible to be the word of god that is n't the case . 
  you may as well have said `` if god is love then i ca n't imagine he would forsake a murderer '' . 
   lev .18:22 thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination . 
   lev .20:13 if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . 
   rom .1:26 -27 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature . 
  and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet . 
  i have no idea what that has to do with what i said . 
  op asked if christianity approves of homosexuality and i 've shown that it does n't . 
  your personal opinion on why the passage is in there is massively irrelevant . 
  you 're welcome to believe whatever you want but call a spade a spade . 
  in line at a vd clinic, 
  that 's right , leviticus contains a whole load of arbitrary and absurd laws , you have no arguments here . 
  i posted the relevant passages since i assumed no-one wanted to read the entirety of leviticus . 
  it 's lovely that you 've decided which parts of the law you want to consider worthy but the reality is that ** if ** you believe it to be the word of god you have 0 case :, 
   matthew 5:18 for verily i say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . 
  also , do n't forget :, 
   matthew 5:18 - for verily i say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . 
  just in case he tries to wriggle out of it, 
  constantly attacking me is doing nothing to change anything . 
  you can say whatever you want about me , i really do n't care , all it does is show how little argument you have . 
  ps : as a general rule , when the punishment for something is death , it 's a fairly good indication that it 's forbidden . 
  huh ? 
  i clearly do n't believe in jesus , as you can see by me constantly calling it a fantasy and absurd . 
  i 'm an atheist who was raised jewish . 
  how dense are you ? 
  if you knew anything about the bible you 'd know that not all commandents are in the 10 commandments . 
  jews believe there were 613 laws in total . 
  not sure of the total for christians but it 's clearly not 10 . 
  right . 
  except for this :, 
   matthew 5:18 for verily i say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . 
  if you believe the bible to be true , you believe it * all * to be true . 
  do n't pretend like you can just say `` god is love '' and then ignore all the parts you do n't like . 
  i do n't really think it 's a contradiction . 
  i think modern christians take the messages they want from the bible and pretend the rest does n't exist . 
  that 's what happens when you try to use 21st century morality and apply it to bronze age doctrines . 
  i do n't disagree with anything you said . 
  however , * not * following the laws you do n't like simply makes you a hypocrite . 
  again , i 'm not addressing the morality of the answer , i 'm simply answering it factually . 
  if you 're asking what god thinks about homosexuality ( i 'm presupposing that if you 're asking the question you believe in god ) then the answer is clear . 
  i made 0 moral judgement , simply answered the question . 
  he can ( and will ) take from it whatever the hell he likes . 
  ca n't go wrong with belgian, 
  some do and some do n't . 
  hope that you have one that does . 
  it means you should stop upvoting yourself on your second account . 
  it does n't do anything anyway .

  who said i did n't upvote you ? 
  do you want a screenshot of it ? 
  i want all that sweet , delicious karma so that i can trade it in at the reddit store .
