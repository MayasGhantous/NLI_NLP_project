  nature has papers * all the time * on global warming . 
  this is too good . 
  too good . 
  quickly , alert the scientists !, 
  he 's cracked the code . 
  how about this , i 'll make you a deal . 
  when you publish your peer-reviewed article debunking global warming and win that nobel prize you 'd be ** gauranteed ** to win as a result , i 'll suck your cock as a congratulations . 
  oooo this will be good . 
  why will we all be dead by then ? 
  the illuminati ? 
  ancient aliens are coming back ? 
  did you wish it really hard using the secret ? 
  you have no clue . 
  satellite data is n't the only way to look at climate trends . 
  how the hell could we answer without knowing who you 're asking, 
  or ... be a grown up and get over it . 
  we would have a mission leaving for mars in the next 10 years . 
  also , the proportion of academic papers that are coming out of the us ( currently dropping ** fast ** ) will go back up over time . 
  because the religious right in america has a huge influence over legislation and they 're primarily christian . 
  because they can sell a lot more advertising during reality tv shows, 
  i do n't think the two are mutually exclusive . 
  people heading online for music is part of the reason why reality tv is more profitable . 
  why ca n't you talk to your friend about that ? 
  maybe because you framed it as a criticism . 
  `` hey , x is annoying '' . 
  if that pisses your friend off you have bigger problems . 
  amirite men ? 
  the back of an adult video store, 
  '' * oh look ... is n't he cuuuute * '', 
  sounds productive and wo n't escalate things at all . 
  that really depends on why it upsets you that she brings it up . 
  if it upsets you because you feel guilty , that 's something you can work on personally . 
  if it 's in the past , you 've made sincere apologies and changed yourself , you 're allowed to forgive yourself , even if she does n't . 
  if it upsets you because she 's using it to emotionally manipulate you or holds it against you , you need to tell her firmly that while you feel sorry for what you did , you were a kid and made mistakes . 
  tell her it upsets you when she holds it over you and that if she loves you she 'll understand that you 're not perfect . 
  well , your parents had a part in it but that 's not really the point . 
  the point is that blaming eachother and making the situation adversarial will only escalate the issue . 
  it 's bullshit pseudoscience . 
  please do n't waste your time or money . 
  there 's an idea in psychology called `` unconditional positive regard '' and it 's what most psychologists recommend for parenting . 
  the idea is that no matter what your child does , you punish/reward the * action * and not the child . 
  so , for example , the kid draws on the wall . 
  your response should be : `` drawing on the wall is naughty because it makes lots of mess '' and not '' you 're a naughty boy for drawing on the wall '' . 
  the reason for that is two-fold ; 1 ) you do n't want your child to feel like they 're a naughty kid and therefore act like one and 2 ) it can make the child feel like they 're rejected if they make mistakes . 
  i think we can safely say that 2 is in effect here . 
  the way your mum is treating you is making you feel like she loves you less because you 've made mistakes and that 's not fair . 
  however , despite it being unfair , you ca n't control how she acts , only how you act . 
  what you * can * do is realise that your mum is hurt ( she might feel guilty about it and it 's easier to blame you than herself or a million other reasons ) and she 's limited in the way she knows how to deal with this situation . 
  the best thing you can do is make sure you know that you 're acting in the way you want to act ( apologise , do the right things now , move on with your life ) and just accept that she might not be able to give you want you want or is fair . 
  when i realised that being in bed by 10:00 feels fantastic . 
  i 'm 23, 
  great attitude . 
  it 's a really hard moment in life when we realise that our parents are n't all-good or all-bad . 
  they 're complex , limited and make mistakes too . 
  i think one of the most important stages of becoming an adult is forgiving your parents for what they do n't / did n't give you . 
  one time i was having sex doggie-style with my so and she had a huge pimple on her ass . 
  i did n't want to stop so i only told her when we finished . 
  she was mortified , i thought it was hilarious . 
  i 'm not really sure why you 're being downvoted so heavily . 
  it 's a touchy subject but it is a scientific question . 
  as for an actual answer : okay , so there are n't any studies that have found a fundamental difference in the brain structure of religious and non-religious people but there are some interesting neurological and psychological elements involved . 
  1 ) neurological - some have claimed that religious visions can be caused by temporal lobe epilepsy . 
  some support for this notion has been given by an experiment called `` the god helmet '' . 
  there are some great youtube videos on that so look there for an explanation but the tl ; dw is that stimulating a certain area in the temporal lobe can cause a type of spooky sense that something else is around . 
  the other piece of interesting information to add is that a recent series of fmri experiments showed that beliefs were processed differently in the brain based on the type of belief they were ( sam harris was one of the authors on this ) . 
  the paper is fascinating but a challenging read for someone with no neuroscience background . 
  2 ) psychological - the other important factor to remember is that ** everybody ** has flawed reasoning processes . 
  it 's why science exists . 
  we need to account for those flaws . 
  atheists make many silly attributions too so there does n't * need * to be a fundamentally different brain structure , just flawed reasoning applied to a different area . 
  ( if you want more info on how we 're flawed reasoners just let me know ), 
  i thought getting head was like getting a blow job but they only put the head in their mouth . 
  i could n't understand why a girl would be willing to do * just * that . 
  everyone has different pathways . 
  what you 're asking for is well beyond our scanning capabilities . 
  the best we can do is look for gross activity in an area by measuring blood flow . 
  bonus question : how painful is the next few days after the operation ? 
  rocky, 
  because men are better at sport . 
  make sure he 's seeking professional help and just be supportive . 
  remember , this is a real medical condition with real consequences if it does n't get treated . 
  you can provide support but you would n't ask us what you can do to help if he had cancer . 
  get him to a professional . 
  that this is a stupid idea for a question . 
  try to find out if there 's any free counselling available in your area , even if it 's just a suicide hotline . 
  most cases of agoraphobia have to do with fear of not being in a controlled situation when something goes wrong . 
  op 's situation is a little less common but for the vast majority it 's fear of panic attacks . 
  after several panic attacks ( which are a horrendous experience ) sufferers get scared to be in a place they wo n't be able to escape or will be vulnerable while panicking . 
  this behaviour is then negatively reinforced ( negative reinforcement = takes away a negative stimulus ) as they do n't have attacks in their home and become less and less likely to leave over time without intervention . 
  because most people are sick of saccharin shows like modern family where there 's some minor issue to start each episode that is wrapped up in a neat bow after 22 minutes with a little canned moral thrown in at the end . 
  it 's boring . 
  did n't matter , had sex , few times . 
  we are reddit . 
  we are same . 
  if your girlfriend wants to smell books she 's welcome to . 
  that does n't mean the kindle is horrible that she means she has some weird book fetish . 
  each to their own . 
  `` i never learned to count '', 
  blindness, 
  punch it .
