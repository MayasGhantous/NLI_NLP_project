  it works . 
  they 're always in the last place you look, 
   it is considered very overdiagnosed, 
  [ citation required ] . 
  you may think it is but that 's not the consensus within the psychological community ( if you want overdiagnosed , look at adhd ) . 
  it 's a very serious medical condition and the sooner we treat it like one , the sooner people will get adequate care and support . 
  continue living in australia, 
  take the blue pill, 
  hooray !, 
  now help me with my lab report . 
  which is fantastic if that gets you off . 
  it does n't work for everyone . 
  i personally love audiobooks and get through ** way ** more than i could physical books . 
  i know that does n't work for most people but it does for me . 
  america amuses me . 
  it 's so weird that you have basically mandatory tipping , it seems so counter-intuitive . 
  why not pay them a normal wage and then tip the ones that go above and beyond ( like most countries do ) . 
  we could eat soylent green, 
  draw me an interesting askreddit question, 
  try to take over the world, 
  because it causes lots of them too, 
  do n't hurt me, 
  what you 're asking is n't a scientific question because by nature it is n't measurable or falsifiable . 
  i ca n't possibly prove that something i ca n't measure does n't exist but if it does n't affect anything we do measure , it 's meaningless until we can . 
  i do n't always buy games from developers who market on reddit but when i do , it 's because they made me laugh . 
  i 'm so full of brave juice right now . 
  sir , please have a seat over here . 
  iae just so proud of reddit right now . 
  #### so brave, 
  see that unsubscribe button on the right ? 
  either that or get res, 
  `` do n't eat the brown acid '', 
  grace by jeff buckley . 
  unparalleled . 
  reddit whole time, 
  i 'm so , so , so , so , so sick of these posts about r/atheism . 
  i do n't spend a lot of time in r/atheism . 
  you know why ? 
  because i do n't like it much . 
  you know what i do when an optional page on a website i ** choose ** to use does n't fit with what i want ? 
  i do n't go to it . 
  seriously , how difficult is it to ignore ? 
  also , what exactly did you * think * that r/atheism was going to talk about ? 
  you might not realise this but r/atheism talks about atheism , religion and atheism related issues . 
  you might as well say i 'm so sick of all the posts about gaming in r/gaming . 
  they 're so preachy trying to tell me to like games . 
  no-one is forcing you to go to r/atheism and no-one is forcing you to like it . 
  if you want to make a different type of atheism subreddit , go for it . 
  if you do n't want to , fucking ignore r/atheism . 
  ** tl ; dr ** this is reddit where the entire purpose is that we get the content that we vote for . 
  if you do n't like it , do n't read that page or make a different that has a different focus . 
  clearly enough people * want * that content that it 's there . 
  1000 upvotes . 
  yeh , do n't you hate it when you go to a subreddit about a topic and they 're talking about that topic . 
  it 's so lame . 
  philately will get you nowhere, 
  i know right . 
  do n't you hate it when you go to all those pages on reddit that force you to sit there and read them . 
  it 's the worst !, 
  this one time , i decided to use / all , you know that page that makes it so you can see every subreddit regardless of what you think of it , and i saw content i did n't like . 
  i never got back that inch of screen it wasted . 
  hi , i 'm a buddhist , and i thought i could get some karma if i post here too . 
  except that the entire point of askreddit is that you 're supposed to be asking for other people 's opinions . 
  that 's what makes it / ** ask ** reddit and not / rant . 
  if this was in / rant i would ignore it . 
  since he 's asking my opinion i gave it . 
  totally with you there . 
  that song drew me into the album . 
  however , after the 8,000 th listen , i think i 've finally decided that grace itself is the most exquisite song . 
  this one . 
  if only there were some way to pick which subreddits you do and do n't want on your frontpage . 
  like some easily accessible ` unsubscribe ' button or something . 
  it 's generally unwise to pierce a website . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  you want to look at / all but only the things you want to see ? 
  i have no words . 
  so you want to use the function that makes it so you see all the content unfiltered but you want it filtered to only include the things you want to see ? 
  because 99.99 % of the population know ** nowhere near enough ** about economics , foreign affairs etc. 
  to have a reasonably valuable opinion on the issues . 
  yes because what you 're saying is retarded and you seem to be failing to see that . 
  that 's different then . 
  what you 're talking about is having elites within certain fields making policy which is a totally different and more fruitful idea . 
  having an iphone app so you can vote on tax reform is ludicrous . 
  they wait a few weeks until people forget, 
  in terms of influence you ca n't go past buddy rich, 
  clothing, 
  have inane small talk with people you 'll never see again . 
  what else would you do ? 
  my high school had a deb ball that came complete with weeks of dance practice . 
  the entire thing was a massive moneymaking venture for the school . 
  worst part was , i spent weeks laying the groundwork with my partner only to be sitting next to her , about to kiss her when i had to run out of the room to go puke everwhere . 
  worst night ever . 
  you clearly have some underlying trust issues . 
  have you considered talking to a therapist to try and work through some of it ? 
  it could be very valuable , especially with your anxiety . 
  queen plays bohemian rhapsody live for me . 
  i could die happy in that moment . 
  do n't do what i did and accidentally set off the alarm at 6am , waking his dad who also happens to have cancer and probably needed his sleep . 
  i had the same thing last year ( grew up in a jewish family ) . 
  just pace yourself with the food .
