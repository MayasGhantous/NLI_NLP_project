  there 's soooooooo much . 
  this is maybe the most pointless and open question i 've seen on askreddit . 
  seriously , we get some asinine questions but you basically asked for people to list * any * behaviour they 've seen in the span of an * entire * year . 
  the default subreddits are regularly changed to reflect the most popular ones . 
  if atheism is taken off by the admins , they 're being unfair and censoring which is against what reddit stands for . 
  i 'm sure you can manage the 4 seconds it takes to unsubscribe if it 's that painful for you . 
  if you 're too stupid to see the massive unsubscribe button the right then i really do n't care . 
  i just do n't really understand what you 're arguing for . 
  the entire point of reddit is that it 's customisable and you find the subreddits that suit you . 
  the default subreddits are decided by popularity ie. , you seem the things that the * most * people are enjoying . 
  i get that * you * do n't enjoy it but * you 're * not the majority . 
  however , you ** do ** have the ability to change your reddit experience to only see what you want to see . 
  that 's fine , i have no problem with you doing that , i just do n't really get why other people 's reddit experience should change just because ** you ** do n't like it . 
  why would the admins change the default subreddits because of what they think people * will * like when we have very good measures of what people do/don ' t want to see ? 
  yes . 
  if they were popular enough i would . 
  i do n't think it 's the admin 's position to say which should and should n't be defaults . 
  as for you not believing me , they were all changed a few months ago to reflect reddit 's evolving taste . 
  honestly , at this point i think you 're arguing just for the sake of it . 
  i ca n't genuinely believe that you really think that unsubscribing is more difficult to do than finding new subreddits that you do n't know about . 
  you do n't get any karma for a self-post . 
  attention whore would be more accurate . 
  i hate all of those subreddits that force you to read them constantly and do n't let you unsubscribe . 
  oh wait , that 's right , you do n't * have * to look at them . 
  $ 150,000 was raised . 
  of all the things to complain about are you really that upset that a few inches of your frontpage were taken up with huge amounts of money being donated to charity ? 
  really ? 
  i 've seen lots of really interesting discussions but not enough questions come in, 
  your friend being a douche on facebook = / = anything about r/atheism . 
  it says a lot more about you than the subreddit, 
  creepy , no and no . 
  your backyard, 
  it 's called sarcasm . 
  my point is that people bitching about subreddits is silly . 
  not really unless you 're wanting to do something like a look drive from perth ( bottom ) to broome ( top ) . 
  there 's more to see on the east coast . 
  melbourne is the best city in the world . 
  nice try , mom . 
  #### see what i did there ? 
   shitty, 
  shitty ? 
  i do n't want to live on this ungrateful planet anymore . 
  but it 's okay to pig out . 
  i look forward to your future karma cash-cows ; wedding , first-born etc. 
  real redditors do n't celebrate by sleeping with their new fiance . 
  you know , unless they post it on gonewild for more karma . 
  exactly . 
  in australia we cull the stupid by giving them kinder surprises . 
  if they do n't choke to death , they earn the right to grow up and eventually reproduce . 
  my cursor became a hand . 
  even in virtual parties i 'm a socially awkward penguin, 
  whose your daddy, 
  i did this and i 'm waiting for the cash to come in . 
  so excited !, 
  what a terrible piece of advice in this economy . 
  giving it to the nigerian prince is genuinely a better suggestion . 
  worst, 
  novelty, 
  ever, 
  you ca n't control her . 
  be supportive , let her know you 're there for her and that she can always talk to you and just be patient . 
  if you try to force her to change her behaviour it will * only * be counter-productive . 
  twitter . 
  he uses it regularly . 
  best of luck . 
  stay safe . 
  new years resolutions this big tend to not work . 
  best of luck though, 
  then let her know you 're that for her . 
  you know what gets her to talk to you ? 
  feeling safe with you . 
  if you present yourself as a non-threat . 
  a safe-haven where she can express herself and ask questions freely . 
  if you show her that you wo n't judge her ( i 'm guessing she 's not getting that from your parents ) she 'll * maybe * open up . 
  beauty from much variety, 
  you were too worried . 
  that 's what happened . 
  it 's okay to be nervous . 
  just try to focus on the sensation and get out of your own head . 
  you might even find it helps to tell her you 're nervous and that 's why it 's tricky . 
  then you do n't have to worry about her being offended . 
  nice try , out of stories plagiarist . 
  it would be impossible to answer that without giving medical advice . 
  socks and undies are regularly my most enjoyed presents . 
  also , from a cynical perspective , there are a bunch of countries in the middle east that thoroughly hate america and the west . 
  however , they hate israel more . 
  while israel is there , the west is n't their first focus . 
  i love my general excellence . 
  it 's normal to still be sad when thinking about your dad but after 2 years it sounds like you might get some benefit talking to a psychologist or a grief counsellor . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being sad but it seems like you still have a lot of pain and there could be some real value in talking it out . 
  yes . 
  it 's like first lesson of econ101, 
  steve ? 
  did she tell you that she 's not into dating in a situation where she thought you might be about to crack onto her ? 
  it might be a nice way of rejecting you . 
  there 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  firstly , your friends and family are n't qualified in the same way and ca n't offer you the same training/objectivity that a professional can . 
  secondly , they 're also grieving and may need the space to deal with their own issues . 
  do n't assume that because they 're not emotional , they 're not just as effected . 
  well , kinda yeh .
