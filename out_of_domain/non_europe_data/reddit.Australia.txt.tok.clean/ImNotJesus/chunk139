  the most important thing is you need to help her feel safe and understood . 
  sit there and listen to her ( i know it 's hard ) and just let her know that you 're there for her . 
  then you should suggest that when she 's ready she should talk to a professional about it as it might be quite upsetting . 
  let her know that you 'll help her organise it or take her to the appointment if necessary . 
  ** do not make her recount it unless she wants to ** . 
  this is very important . 
  immediately after , her emotions will cause the story to be even worse in her head than the experience . 
  studies have shown that talking about it too much early on , increases the chance of ptsd because the memory becomes more and more upsetting each time . 
  get her to the hospital or police ** if she wants to ** but do n't force her, 
  it 's not the most important thing right now . 
  just make she knows that you 're on her team and you want to support her however she needs . 
  it might mean taking her to the police or hospital , it might mean just being in the same house as her so she can sleep tonight . 
  i 'm sorry you 're in a tough position but you 're making a huge difference to her recovery by supporting her . 
  do n't try to be a therapist if you 're not one . 
  be supportive , listen but do n't try to fix the situation or change her upset . 
  gay or british ? 
  only if they have sex with other men, 
  it 's to do with mad cow . 
  in australia , you ca n't donate if you 've lived in england for more than 6 months during the period when mad cow was around, 
  the last 30 minutes of hancock, 
  like 2 fried eggs nailed to a board ? 
  this post went from potentially hilarious to depressing very quickly . 
  sorry about your dad , that must 've been tough . 
  must hear this story . 
  i think santa clause may be bullshit . 
  do n't have any evidence yet , it 's just a hunch . 
  i assumed you were talking about reddit, 
  `` this is the song that does n't end , yes it goes on and on my friend ... '',

  divinyls - i touch myself, 
  why not 100 ? 
  yeh i could see how making the woman choose between aborting and financial support seems fair , you know , if i had the emotional maturity of a 7 year old, 
  because , you see , when you 're an adult , you 're responsible for the decisions and mistakes that you make . 
  it 's not her responsibility to have an abortion to absolve you of your duties . 
  if you 're fucking her without a condom and do n't know what you 'd do if she got pregnant , you 're a fucking idiot and if you think that she should have to have an abortion ( an incredibly unpleasant experience ) * or * receive support , you 're clearly not mature enough to be having sex in the first place . 
   what was your most ** anything ** new year 's eve ? 
  ftfy, 
  yes . 
  that 's right . 
  if you do n't have your own condom and you 're fucking some random girl you go buy one or turn it down . 
  either that or you risk the consequences . 
  you want to be allowed to be irresponsible and then it 's her responsibility to have an abortion or get no support from the other party ? 
  if your psychiatrist scares you , you should get a new one . 
  if you do n't feel comfortable , do n't feel embarassed to say that it 's not working , it 's ** very ** important to find someone who you can talk to . 
  the world is far nicer than it ever has been . 
  in the past you had about a 15 % chance of dying due to violence , now it 's 3 % ( stats from steven pinker 's new book ) . 
  that being said , the best way to increase overall happiness is getting rid of dogma . 
  i think dogma can be blamed for a huge proportion of the evil in the world . 
  i do n't think we need a revolution . 
  i think it 's happening , slowly . 
  fine , a better example , you decide to get into a car with your friend . 
  you decided to trust your friend with your life but he has an accident . 
  do you instantly become absolved of your responsibility to take care of yourself because he was driving ? 
  sorry , but no . 
  you chose to get in the car , you chose to take that risk . 
  wear a condom or risk the worst-case scenario . 
  ** if you 're not capable of taking responsibility for your choices , you should n't be having sex ** . 
  it 's that simple . 
  upvoting in the hope that i 'll get an update in a week , telling me what happened because this could be hilarious, 
  step 1 . 
  stop caring if you 're popular . 
  step 2 . 
  find friends you actually like . 
  step 3 . 
  step 4 . 
   the law should be in place that the man may chose to abort and not accept responsibility . . if the woman decides to keep it the man should be free from all financial responsibilities . . 
  if you 're arguing that it should only be in a case where one can prove the woman did it deliberately ( impossible to prove in almost any case and therefore a useless law ) then you did n't make that very clear . 
  jewish school did the same for me . 
  brusell sprouts, 
  brusell sprouts are like anal sex . 
  if you 're forced to have them as a child , you 'll hate them as an adult . 
  in australia , jelly means what you call jell-o which always made me think that they sounded disgusting . 
  america dude . 
  my college fantasy was learning how to use apostrophes, 
  i couldnt ' get the hang of it . 
  if you 're not dating , you should n't pay , that 's awkward . 
  when dating , i always paid until we were officially a couple but would expect her to at least offer . 
  real men eat vegemite , not marmite . 
  fruit . 
  easiest question ever . 
  just ask her out on a real date ? 
  i pronounce it potato not potato, 
  you 're right , that does sound stupid . 
  if she 's not interested , you 'll make things weird by paying for her . 
  if she is interested , you 're just potentially wasting your chance by not asking her out . 
  it 's not equal though . 
  you ca n't say that men should have the right to force women to do something that many would never want to do ( i know several non-religious women that would find having an abortiong incredibly distressing ) or be completely alone in raising a child ( not fair to the mum or the child ) . 
  part of being an adult and being ready for sex is n't just about being emotionally ready for the intimacy , it 's about being responsible for your decisions . 
  if you 're with someone who is n't going to have an abortion and you 're not careful or do n't know them well enough to know they 're not crazy ( like in your example ) either do n't have sex or keep your own protection . 
  right . 
  so do it or do n't do it . 
  paying for her meal is awkward either way . 
  ~ ~ any that use their money to proselytise or for a political agenda ~ ~ . 
  anti-vaccine people . 
  fuck them . 
  this . 
  just remember you 're an adult though .
