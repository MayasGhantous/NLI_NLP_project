  well played sir, 
  i like being a schizophrenic on reddit . 
  so do i. 
  me too . 
  [ ] ( / melvin `` when you link to a subreddit all you have to do is type in [ the text ] ( / r/subreddit '' ), 
  ftfy, 
  i made a decision to make the joke understandable over accurate . 
  that being said ; schizophrenia does n't imply multiple personalities but auditory hallucinations can be one of the positive symptoms ( positive in the clinical sense , not good ) and it can be in the form of consistent personalities . 
  i like having cataplexy on re, 
  really ? 
  my lithsp does, 
  ** m i s c o n c e p t i o n **, 
  yeh , i wish more teachers changed grades of students based on private conversations with them and not on the quality of their work . 
  if she 's that stupid she wo n't do well unless she works really hard . 
  if she works hard she deserves to do well . 
  i 'm glad you 're not actually a teacher, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/poe's_law ), 
  surely you jest, 
  i do n't really know what else you expect an atheism subreddit to talk about . 
  1 ) the ` positives of atheism ' is that you 're not religious . 
  there 's no prize given to you when you become an atheist . 
  2 ) r/atheism is n't designed to convert anyone . 
  i 've seen plenty of christians go in and have interesting conversations without getting downvoted but it 's not the purpose of the subreddit . 
  3 ) have you considered that your counterpoints may not have been very good ? 
  4 ) sure the fb posts can be pretty monotonous sometimes but dealing with being the only atheist in a social group is a very big deal for a lot of people , especially americans . 
  the whole point of having a subreddit wherein you share that similarity with other people you * want * to talk about it . 
  that 's the point of a subreddit . 
  5 ) many people think the stupidities in religion are a huge drain on society , especially america . 
  talking about that in r/atheism is no different to talking about how stupid conservatives are in r/politics, 
  damn you posting before me !, 
  politics on reddit : the opposite of conservatives . 
  no it 's the inevitable consequence of being in a minority . 
  it is not an issue for me as i live in australia . 
  my family are used to secular people and do not think i 'm evil for being an atheist because of that . 
  ooo i know this one , just did an assignment on it !, 
  that depends on how intently someone is processing the message . 
  if they are centrally processing ( considering it intently ) then it is important that it has a persuasive message . 
  if it is peripherally processed ( not concentrating ) then it 's about persuasive cues ( ie . 
  fear , attractive people , authority etc. ), 
  dear 16 year old me ; twin towers , two wars , multiple revolutions in the middle east , global depression , your dog dies , it 's still a little while till you 're getting laid . 
  you 're welcome, 
  firstly , there are a huge amount of christian communities that feel that way . 
  secondly , atheists are n't running america ( which is where most of the complaints are ) . 
  thirdly , i would n't expect r/homeopathy to have a bunch of posts about how skeptics are ruining the world , not the way it works . 
  show me on this doll where 4chan touched you, 
  the hammer * is * his penis, 
  i assume they 're disappointed that i 'm not jesus, 
  just raising awareness sir, 
  i 'll admit it ... [ ] ( / fap `` i just realised . . 
  someone , somewhere is having lesbian sex right now '' ), 
  [ ] ( / high `` just within my attention span '' ), 
  da da , da da , dude looks like a lady . 
  seriously though , congrats !, 
  glad you 're happy, 
  oh you 're magnificent, 
  god you must have no pride with a joke like that, 
  omg . 
  may 4th is the date that the first grammy awards were held . 
  ** there 's too much evil **, 
  i read that as inflatable, 
  ** breaking news ** : obesity epidemic in the united states reaches all time highs . 
  well played , sir, 
  note to self : do not use raccoon shit on brain, 
  wow that 's really interesting . 
  i 'd always assumed they get run over because they were rushing across the street after robbing a bank . 
  hillary does make me have some unholy feelings, 
  i 've got this really small , underground penis . 
  you 've probably never heard of it . 
  fapping jokes on reddit are original ? 
  monster rain !,

  really ? 
  vinyl is so mainstream . 
  i 've got everything on betamax, 
  flawless victory . 
  ** f a t a l i t y **, 
  because of my add sometimes i forget to fi, 
  fuck , i totally screwed up father 's day then .

  makes jesus a dull boy, 
  excuse me ma'am but does this smell like chloroform to you ? 
  one time , i spent an hour making comments on a website with the hopes of more people liking my comments than disliking them . 
  except it was n't an hour it was every day of my life on reddit . 
  please love me, 
  thank you kind sir , your affirmation is what i live for, 
  one of the worst novelties i 've seen and there are some bad ones out there . 
  to add to that , my greater concern is that when people who openly express their faith are in power it endorses faith as a virtue which is incredibly dangerous . 
  welcome to my frontpage, 
  you had me at different strokes, 
  redditor for 2 months and 24 days ?

  not everything has to be formulaic '' ),
