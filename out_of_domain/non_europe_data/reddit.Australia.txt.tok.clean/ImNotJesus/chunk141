  edit : i apologise , they 're all from r/politics . 
  how brilliant . 
  if you want some more thought-based examples , the best two i can think of are these :, 
  1 ) priming - studies have shown that conscious thought about related words can actually affect unconscious processes . 
  the two coolest examples of this involve the same team doing two different studies . 
  in the first they had their participants unjumble words with half of the participants having words about being old . 
  after they completed it , participants were timed to see how fast they walked down the hallway . 
  those with the old people words were much slower . 
  the same team then had different people unjumble words and half were about being polite , half about being rude . 
  they were then told to hand their work to a professor . 
  the professor was standing outside his office talking to someone and the test was to see how long it took them to interrupt . 
  those primed for politeness waited much , much longer . 
  some of whom caused the experimenter to stop it after 10 minutes . 
  2 ) unconscious influences - in a basic study , participants were instructed to rate a series of women on attractiveness . 
  the experimenters used the picture of the same girls but artificially dilated their eyes ( an unconscious sign of sexual readiness ) and those were considered to be * far * more attractive . 
  tl ; dr there 's far more to your thoughts/decisions than you or i know, 
  how did you get that figure ? 
  can you read the chapter where r/politics jumps the shark . 
  it 's my favourite one . 
  move to a better country . 
   i have n't met her family yet, 
  you 're still a while off buddy . 
  also , do you live together ? 
  you should n't propose until you 've lived together for at least a year in my opinion . 
  you do n't know someone until you live together . 
  hopefully he does n't catch autism from her .

  edit : [ link for those who do n't know the reference ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxklc8ph7mm ), 
   `` think '', 
  i think i 've worked out your issue, 
  nope . 
  move in together .

  i took an intro philosophy class so i 'm kind of deep, 
  19.5 hours down and i 've spent more than half of it asleep or working . 
  sounds about right . 
  sell apocalypse protection ? 
   it is disrespectful to me and to our marriage to not acknowledge that she is completely mine as much as i am hers, 
  huh ? 
  are you going to change your name to hers ? 
  this is n't equal , you 're asking her to change something she has had her whole life to match * you * . 
  you 're sacrificing nothing . 
  you do n't own her . 
  if this is a dealbreaker for you she can do much , much better . 
  it 's called a ` mondegreen ', 
  cryptobub if you have agoraphobia and social anxiety these concerns are things you should be talking to a psychologist about , not random strangers on the internet . 
  some of the suggestions in here are downright horrible and will be counter-productive . 
  please remember that you 're asking a medical question and you really , really should n't be listening to the advice . 
  suggesting that someone with a serious psychological disorder should self-medicate is n't just wrong , it 's dangerous . 
  please consider the ramifications of what you 're suggesting before actually doing it . 
  ** i wanted to **, 
  ** i wanted to **, 
  this is the reason why getting medical advice on the internet is fucking stupid . 
  anyone who knows enough is smart enough to realise that you should n't do it . 
  the only people who suggest things are people stupid enough to think it 's a good idea . 
  bravo . 
  bravo . 
  not talking about a doctor , i 'm talking about a psychologist for therapy . 
  they are trained to help alleviate agoraphobia , social anxiety and the depression you 're talking about . 
  also , if your friend does n't * offer * to pay for it , he 's a massive cock . 
  that reddit exists . 
  my productivity has dropped significantly . 
  that swishy feeling you get in your stomach after drinking too much, 
  so brave, 
  i was horrified to realise that a bunch of redditors were too young to know good will hunting . 
  what a phenomenal movie . 
  posting after you , hoping for some second-hand karma, 
  potatoes, 
  do n't listen ? 
  say no thank you and close the door . 
  do n't be a cock . 
  ** everyone deaths **, 
  false . 
  you ca n't be catholic . 
  r/atheism has told me that all religious people are morons and since you like the same comedian i like you ca n't be a moron, 
  the one you just told me .

  better be careful to find one without dihydrogen monoxide . 
  if you get too much of it in your lungs it can kill you . 
  first , define optimum in this context . 
  cyanide is natural and found in apples . 
  natural = / = healthy or good, 
  go see your doctor . 
  i took nexium and it worked for me . 
  also talk about diet changes . 
  please do n't ask for medical advice on the internet . 
  go talk to your doctor then . 
  go to the dentist .
