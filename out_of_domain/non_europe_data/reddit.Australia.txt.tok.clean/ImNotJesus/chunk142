  how the hell could any of us know ? 
  i study psychology . 
  99 % of what i see in movies about psychology is wrong .

  i just hacked their system, 
  making them launch their missiles now, 
  oh wow , their guys are trying to stop me , they 're good, 
  yes !, 
  you 're looking for r/rant, 
  i think you did the right thing . 
  it may help to also tell him that you want him to use you for information before trying anything else . 
  tell him that drugs can be really dangerous and you want him to talk to you before trying something different . 
  used to . 
  i went through a depression for several years and wished i could just believe everything would be okay . 
  i 'm glad i could n't though . 
  not having an ultimate answer forces you to learn coping mechanisms and deal with your distress in constructive ways . 
  i 'm a much stronger person for it . 
  the ron paul circlejerkery, 
  no but that 's mainly because i 'm not clinically retarded, 
  god, 
  diamond, 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  what stops me is wanting to live . 
  emotions are transient and i know that i have mechanisms for coping with that upset . 
  i could n't kill myself because it 's the last chance i 've got . 
  surely someone who believed in an afterlife would have more incentive to want to die . 
  you ca n't fake the genuine concern but you can make a more active effort to consider the other person 's experience and motivations . 
  i assure you that it would lead to more empathy . 
  the next iron chef . 
  i genuinely watch it as a comedy and this is coming from a guy who enjoys cooking shows . 
  any examples of common things that could never happen ? 
  we 're not your personal army . 
  post it in r/videos if it 's any good people will upvote it . 
  ps : you 're also kind of a cock for doing it . 
  also , try to take your notes in a way that someone else would understand them . 
  something may make sense to you at the time but if you 're looking at them 2 months later you might 've forgotten the part that makes it obvious . 
  you 'll also remember it better if you try to put it into simple language . 
  do n't aim to finish essays the day before they 're due . 
  if possible , finish it a week early , do n't look at it for a few days and then go back to it . 
  you 'll see things you did n't see before and take the pressure off yourself by not being close to the deadline . 
  i convinced a guy from america ( i 'm from australia ) that i lived near him ( google is awesome ) and that i was keen to buy some weed off him . 
  i made him go out and meet me 3 times over the course of 4 hours before he realised what happened . 
  do n't agree at all . 
  empathy needs to be trained and has natural variation ( low empathy tends to correlate with likelihood to commit crime ) . 
  it 's very important to learn to understand other people 's motivations and experiences , if not for being a better person , it 's valuable in maintaining relationships . 
  swimming in a choppy australian beach . 
  this only happened a few days ago and i was caught in a rip . 
  had a panic attack and almost drowned . 
  fun times . 
  not saying you should force yourself to care . 
  i 'm saying you should force yourself to consider their motivations and reasoning . 
  there 's a difference . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you wo n't have children because you were spanked ? 
  invalid . 
  i had to , sorry . 
  clean it . 
  understandable . 
  have you ever talked to a psychologist about it ? 
  it sounds like you have good insight about your anxiety and it could be fertile ground for self-discovery . 
  from a psychological perspective it does make sense . 
  it 's an affirmation that what you think or what you care about is important . 
  who does n't want to be the funny or interesting person at a party ? 
  i get that it has less real implications that that but it 's easy to see how the same mechanism can cause it . 
  sorry but i feel the need to point this out . 
  ( a ) theism and ( a ) gnosticism are answering different questions . 
  you can be an atheist agnostic , a theist agnostic , an atheist gnostic * or * a theist gnostic . 
  ( a ) theism refers to whether one ** believes ** in god . 
  ( a ) gnosticism refers to whether one thinks that it is possible to ** prove the existence ** of god . 
  i actually agree with you and made the same argument just above . 
  i was taking a guess at what he was trying to say . 
  when i posted it , he had n't replied yet . 
  nope . 
  some atheists believe without certainty that there is no god , others believe that there might be one but they choose not to believe in it and there are plenty in the middle . 
  somewhat . 
  sorry but all people want approval , in one form or another . 
  it 's true that better self-esteem requires less external approval but everyone wants to feel accomplished , respected and like an important member of whatever in-group they are a part of ( social circle , reddit etc. ), 
  sorry if i appeared to be a pedant there . 
  i was n't trying to nitpick for the sake of making a point , i just think it 's a really important distinction . 
  the moment i realised was when i was watching a comedian on tv ( maybe 10 years ago ) and he said something to the extent of `` a new study has shown that 93 % of guys masturbate . 
  that same study showed that 7 % of guys are fucking liars '', 
   parents, 
  i think you mean 18-21 year olds who think they understand parenting . 
  i 'd recommend seeing someone nearby . 
  a psychologist not a psychiatrist though . 
  i 'm not sure really sure that you can call it an `` ideal tool '' if it causes 10 bad outcomes in exchange for 1 positive outcome that can be achieved through other means ( many of which have other positive outcomes associated with them ) . 
  i 'm partial to a bit of a manhug now and then as long as it does n't linger . 
  also , everyone appreciates a bit of a reach around now and then . 
  it 's not gay because you do n't make eye contact . 
  learn to meditate and see a psychologist if they 're ongoing . 
  the reason panic attacks happen is that you get into a feedback loop : feel anxious -  body starts to respond to anxiety in the appropriate way ( heart rate , tight chest etc. ), 
  -  notice body response and feel more anxious -  greater body response etc. 
  the best way to stop yourself is to try and focus on your breathing . 
  feel the sensation of the breath going in and out . 
  if this does n't work for you ; try to tense and relax each muscle individually . 
  you can practice these by learning to meditate . 
  if you search for ucla mindfulness on itunes the ucla centre for mindfulness has some introductory guided meditations . 
  i have ~ ~ two ~ ~ three :, 
  in bed with a girl for 2 hours ( at 2am ) watching table tennis on tv and cuddling . 
  at no point did i realise i was supposed to make a move .
