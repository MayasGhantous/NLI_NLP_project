  on a date , get invited inside . 
  watch tv with her for about an hour until she basically sits on my lap . 
  i then realise i probably should 've kissedher a while ago . 
  i 've had a girl offer to walk me to my car after a date and did n't make a move . 
  not everyone likes being on medication and there are other side effects . 
  i used to suffer from them and do n't anymore . 
  no medication required . 
  that being said , if it works for you , that 's great . 
  i 've had a girl offer to walk me to my car after a date and did n't pick up on it . 
  some advice that really helped me lose weight :, 
  i think smokers and dieters get stuck in the same trap . 
  as it 's something you normally do regularly , each time you `` miss '' out ( think about smoking but do n't or want a naughty meal but eat healthily ) you feel like you 've lost something . 
  what i changed was that i started looking at each good meal as me being 1 meal closer to my goal . 
  that way , i felt rewarded for having the good meal instead of like i 'd missed out on something . 
  if you 're a 20 a day smoker and have 5 that day , why not be happy that you 're 15 cigarettes healthier ? 
  maybe try r/asksocialscience, 
  except that all you have is this guy 's word that it happened and we know nothing about what happened just before it . 
  if op just punched someone it may have been justified . 
  do n't assume he 's telling the truth . 
  took it a couple of months maybe, 
  i think what 's much more valuable ( and some schools are starting to do it ) is actually teaching basic emotional intelligence skills in primary school . 
  be honest . 
  say `` i 'm sorry , i really like you and have enjoyed our time together but we 're at different stages and i 'm not ready for what you want '', 
  because they secretly wish it was them getting all the attention, 
  that and according to many people , it 's basically cold reading bunk . 
  hobbies , self-fulfilment through achievement , social ties , love relationship , personal growth and exercise, 
  gone in 60 seconds, 
  my car . 
  it 's fun as fuck but i 've spent almost as much repairing it as i did on the purchase ( alfa 156 ), 
  `` i do n't know you , stop following me '', 
  use condoms until you 're together long enough to both get tested for everything ** and ** you know her well enough to trust that she 'll use birth control . 
  exactly . 
  if she 's a fundie christian who wo n't have an abortion and you knock her up , you got ta live with that . 
  take a picture obviously . 
  i ca n't imagine how that could be dangerous in any way . 
  i ca n't beat this answer . 
  she was really nervous and we basically just pecked each other over and over . 
  later that day she told me that she would kill herself if i did n't date her and sent me pictures of marks on her wrists . 
  all up , not totally great . 
  obviously the same thing applies . 
  it was just an example of a common reason why a woman would feel uncomfortable with an abortion . 
  not having a go at anyone .

  r/politics will surely win . 
  i think they could beat r/atheism and r/circlejerk combined, 
  `` a little extra '' would be my honest assessment . 
  i do n't mean this at all critically , it 's just my experience from using dating websites that i 'd be far more likely to go out with a girl who describes herself as a little bit bigger than one who has one good photo of herself and tries to pretend to be really skinny . 
  best advice for dating website : ** be your fucking self ** . 
  there are that many people there , your focus should be finding someone who likes ** you ** , not some impression of what you think other people want . 
  best of luck !, 
  looking at engagement rings with my girlfriend . 
  i asked to look at 20-30k rings and they did n't laugh and ask me to immediately leave . 
  offer to pay . 
  it 's rude * not to * . 
  order whatever you like . 
  however , if he does n't get an appetiser , i would n't get one . 
  wear nice clothes but not a ball gown . 
  do n't tell him you like him , it 's a first date , it 's like a job interview . 
  you 'll find out afterwards how you went , not during . 
  just be yourself , be friendly and ask lots of questions . 
  be interested in what he has to say and try to relate/find common ground . 
  most importantly ** have fun ** . 
  good luck !, 
  til that / r/circlejerk is the best subreddit in the world . 
  upvote dis if it is best 5eva, 
  i 'm marinating in brave juice right now, 
  i nominate ron paul as best / r/circlejerk moderator . 
  he is the mostest bravest and i luv him 5eva, 
  #### i 'm so angry and so brave right now, 
  get him to stop and start . 
  tell him to let you know if he 's getting close and you can change positions . 
  makes it more fun that way anyway . 
  suggest more foreplay . 
  find positions that you can use your hands, 
  i just do n't have that much spare time, 
  plus scrubs . 
  do n't forget scrubs . 
  i ca n't imagine his campaign will last for long . 
  did n't you hear about the leak coming from his inner sanctum ? 
  because , you see , you draw a whole bunch of attention to him and then stop the feed halfway through because umm ... well ... 
  i got nothing, 
  go to / r/gonewild this is n't the right subreddit, 
  i can physically taste the biterness, 
  hospitals would be overrun 9 months later, 
  he wo n't stay down for long . 
  he 's a republican candidate we can all get behind . 
  do n't get too excited just yet . 
  i know there 's a big hole for him to fill in the republican party but there 's still a long , dark passage ahead . 
  the `` someone '' is dan savage , a relationship/sex advice columnist/podcaster .

  listen to `` if i did n't have you '' - tim minchin, 
  go see your doctor .
