  it could mean a lot of things , some of which are harmless but you should get it checked out . 
  99.9 % of the questions on askreddit are stupid . 
  you must not be in the / new queue very often . 
  being more focussed when it 's time to focus . 
  fuck you reddit . 
  not sure , it showed up for a moment then went into the spam filter, 
  terrible novelty account . 
  please stop . 
  they 're in love and excited . 
  i 'm sorry that it takes up 3 inches of space on your facebook wall but there is a hide button if it annoys you that much . 
  you seem bitter by complaining about it . 
  you could always ... hang up . 
  i was avocado head for a while . 
  a guy on my bus thought my head was avocado shaped . 
  racism is n't about having preferences , it 's about treating people differently based on stereotypes/ingroup-outgroup bias . 
  if you do n't shop in a store because the person is black , that 's racist . 
  if you 're not attracted to someone because they 're black , that 's a preference . 
  if you ca n't marry a black person because you do n't trust niggers , that 's racist . 
  see the difference ? 
  it may be a coping mechanism . 
  it may be indicative of some other underlying feelings . 
  it 's not really possible to say unless you discuss it with a psychologist who can talk through it with you . 
  not saying that you * need * to , but it may be fruitful . 
   then i feel bad that i dont feel bad, 
  remorse would be atypical for sociopathy . 
  right . 
  he 's a cock . 
  does n't change that what his friends did was wrong . 
  no arguments, 
  insane is n't really a clinically useful term . 
  there are guidelines for knowing if someone suffers from a specific psychopathology but there is often a decent amount of variation in their presentation of symptoms . 
  well that depends on the specific disorder . 
  there 's what 's called the diagnostics and statistics manual ( dsm ) that outlines what is the typical presentation of a particular disorder . 
  for example , schizophrenia is split into two types of symptoms ; positive and negative ^ 1 . 
  to be diagnosed as schizophrenic you need at least 2 symptoms from the list , at least one of which needs to be a positive symptom . 
  1 : positive/negative does n't mean good/bad , it means something present that does n't exist ( hallucinations , delusions etc. ), 
  or something that should be there , not being ( normally sensory or speech related ) . 
  ** edit ** : found a short [ summary ] ( http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/articles/hustig/husbox1.html ) of the dsm entry for schizophrenia, 
  that 's where training and experience comes in . 
  for example , there 's often minutia about the symptoms that the patient would n't be aware of . 
  also , most diagnoses necessitate the symptoms being present for a certain period of time ( often a few months ), 
  nice try , drug dealer who is still a bad guy, 
  i do n't know what this is but i really , really want to . 
  really black or hypothetically black ? 
  but if he 's hypothetically real is n't he only hypothetically black ? 
  a very hypothetical black or very black hypothetical ? 
  hypothetical weekends or real weekends ? 
  i think i understand now . 
  yes, 
  banana male . 
  peach female, 
  paul : laws/war/science = bad, 
  bachmann/perry/santorum : go god go, 
  romney : democrats are wrong, 
  ** edit : thought i should add my expanding that i did further down to this post **, 
  well bachmann is out now . 
  paul is like your grumpy old uncle who thinks there should n't be any laws and people should be able to basically do whatever they want ( i 'm going to get downvoted to shit because there are a lot of paul supporters on reddit ) . 
  he wants to legalise weed ( why he has so many supporters on reddit ) , pull out of wars and take power away from the federal government ( really stupid when you have states that vary so much - think about what louisiana is going to be like if they can do whatever they want ) . 
  he 's also scientifically illiterate - does n't believe in evolution or global warming . 
  perry/santorum are basically just hard right-wing conservative christians . 
  they want to instil `` christian values '' into politics ( ie. , banning abortion , teaching creationism etc. ), 
  romney is basically a contrarian and running on a platform of `` i 'm slightly less crazy than the others '' . 
  he 's an old businessman and will do anything to win , including pandering like crazy . 
  well , you 've got 3 years of what you 're going to get . 
  historically speaking , the president tries to get re-elected with their first term and then tries to make massive changes in their second . 
  i would expect him to be a bolder version of this term 's obama . 
  it 's distracting and kind of awkward . 
  i 'd prefer to take turns any day . 
  better than not asking at all, 
  it 's true ^ 1, 
  cleo magazine, 
  the last one was also a war hero a few decades ago, 
  snap !, 
  me too . 
  it stopped me transferring into the course i wanted to for an extra year . 
  found out i got in a few weeks ago , one of the happiest moments of my life . 
  incest is wrong, 
  vanity fair . 
  it 's an x-post from / r/politics, 
  see that van outside your house ? 
  wave to me, 
  the distinction is that when a comedian is doing a bit , it does n't necessarily reflect their personal views . 
  you would n't blame an actor for playing a racist character would you ? 
  also , you can choose whether or not to listen to a comedian if you 're offended by their material . 
  if you 're offended by a politician , it 's relevant to the media because that may affect people 's voting . 
  possibly . 
  if you do n't feel comfortable with it , do n't see their act . 
  sometimes they are, 
  tiny moustaches would be far more popular, 
  the use of humor , irony , exaggeration , or ridicule to expose and criticize people 's stupidity or vices , particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues, 
  if a comedian is n't being satirical when they 're being racist , they probably are n't very funny . 
  also , there 's an unspoken agreement that a comedian is trying to entertain/be funny . 
  a politician is trying to get a message across . 
  this was when i was 15 and working at my first job at a supermarket . 
  knowing that i was leaving soon he looked the other way when i was caught throwing eggs at another building with some other guys . 
  i feel shit about it in hindsight , not at all my character and i got sucked into the moment . 
  luckily my boss recognised that and told me as much . 
  examples ? 
  not as far as i know,
