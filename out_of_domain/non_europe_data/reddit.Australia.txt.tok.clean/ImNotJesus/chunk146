  he was the original and the best . 
  because abortion is n't discussed in scientific/rational/medical terms , it 's discussed in emotive terms . 
  that obviously depends on what the proof is , which god it is and what that god stands for ( i find it improbable it would be exactly a god that humans have conceived of since all of the religious stories are so flawed ) . 
  it 's a slow process that involves introspection , honesty , creating new structures for dealing with distress and time . 
  a good psychologist can help you do most of that . 
  this is very unpopular on reddit but not so much in the rest of my life . 
  i get downvoted to shit everytime i post it on reddit despite most of reddit claiming to be pro-science but here goes :, 
  i believe that hitting children for any reason is wrong . 
  i think the evidence is unambiguous that it is n't just an ineffective strategy ( creates short-term compliance with no long-term behaviour change ) but also causes emotional damage and damages the parent-child relationship . 
  more than happy to give evidence and further explanation to anyone who is interested in the actual facts behind it instead of `` i was hit and i deserved it '' , `` if you do n't , they 'll be spoiled brats '' or `` i was hit and i turned out okay '' . 
  the only reason the thread always fucks up is because people downvote things they disagree with instead upvoting them to learn more/discuss them . 
  the reason men find them attractive is that they 're a signal of fertility and sufficient oestrogen production during puberty . 
  redditor 's wife , also known as , `` the joke from the frontpage 3 hours ago '', 
  that 's a really clever novelty account . 
  i like the way you do the thing it says in your name, 
  a frontpage post that was n't true ? 
  on reddit ? 
  impossible . 
  and why is that ? 
  what evidence do you have that people should think of spanking as a good thing ? 
  not as far as i know, 
  ah you may be right , can be read either way . 
  at the time the post was 1/1 so i assumed he 'd downvoted me, 
  i withdraw my unwarranted vitriol, 
  let yourself feel what you need to feel . 
  do n't be scared of it and do n't try to drown it out with alcohol/drugs/etc . 
  talk as much as you feel comfortable and try to be around friends . 
  this moment in time is the worst it will feel , it 's all getting easier over time . 
  i 'm sorry and it sucks . 
  if you want to message me at any time and just vent , feel free , i 'm on reddit a fair bit . 
  if you do n't feel the pain easing , there 's absolutely no shame in seeing a psychologist in the short term , just while you deal with it . 
  getting over a relationship is about grieving , it 's no different to losing someone to death . 
  you 'll be okay with time , i promise . 
  is that you , peter ? 
  nice one, 
  a lawyer , too busy taking care of her boss decides it time to quit . 
  can her boss win her back ? 
  will they save the environment and each others hearts ? 
  i know it 's over a sentence but there 's no making that movie sound good . 
  me getting laid, 
  i know , it feels like it will never end when you 're in the middle of it . 
  however , you will love again and you will feel okay again . 
  the thoughts might still be as strong as the day you broke up but i 'm sure the sting is n't . 
  i ca n't tell you how long it will be but at some point in the not too distant future you 'll let go of the * idea * of her . 
  it takes such a long time because you do n't just need to give up what you had but also everything you thought you were going to have in the future . 
  but , it will happen , when you 're ready . 
  start trying to spend time imagining what would make a happy life without her . 
  it doens ' t need to be about better/worse just start trying to think about what would make you happy in general and try to move towards some of those goals . 
  good man !, 
  i was n't kidding when i said you can feel free to message me . 
  i know it can be a lonely process and sometimes the anonymity of the net is what you need to feel safe enough to talk it through . 
  one time i got accused of shooting the deputy . 
  i did shoot the sheriff but i swear it was in self defence . 
  big momma 's house !, 
  transformers !, 
  not sure about the rules there but you ca n't practice psychology without honours and a masters/doctorate in australia and there 's too much competition in org psych to do anything with just a psych degree . 
  starbucks is the correct answer . 
  that 's because you did n't mention all the glitter . 
  twilight !, 
  none as i 'm sane . 
  next time try google,

  what 's that ? 
  billy is stuck down the well ? 
  no i 'm hungry you idiot, 
  there 's a difference between unconditional love and unconditional approval . 
  if my mum did something horrible , i would n't approve but i also would n't love her any less . 
  you can decide that someone is n't worth your time/effort but still love them and be sad for that loss . 
  there 's an idea in psychology called ` unconditional positive regard ' and it 's what most experts think you should provide your children with . 
  it basically means that you get upset/angry/happy / etc. 
  at the * act * but not the child itself . 
  for example , `` i 'm upset that you drew on the wall '' instead of `` i 'm upset at * you * for drawing on the wall '' . 
  in my opinion , unconditional positive regard means that even if you have to go to the lengths of kicking a child out of your house ( ca n't imagine ever doing it personally ) , they should ** always ** know that they 're loved and cared for , no matter what . 
  it 's the same reason spanking is a completely ineffective punishment . 
  it increases immediate compliance but has consistently shown to have negative long-term outcomes as well in behaviour and parent-child relationship . 
  kids are going to do shit wrong for all sorts of reasons . 
  the ** last ** thing you want to do is lead them to believe they are a bad child since they 'll start acting that way . 
  look . 
  my dad is pretty shit in a lot of ways ( not a rapist but he is in a borderline cult ) and there are times when i 'm really tempted to just cut ties with him and have in the past ( did n't talk for a year ) . 
  part of being an adult is seeing your parents as flawed individuals who do some good and some bad . 
  i 'm not saying you should * forgive * rape , what i 'm saying is that you can still love someone for what they 've been to you in the past , even if they 're not still that to you . 
  also , some people are n't worth of love , that 's totally different . 
  children are a different case though . 
  purely anecdotal :, 
  i had a back issue for a while that i saw a chiropractor for ( same as you , a cracking one that did n't talk bullshit ) who cracked my spine a few times . 
  it felt better for a day and got worse again . 
  however , my back kept getting worse and i eventually saw a physiotherapist . 
  one appointment later it was discovered that my hamstrings were too tight and some gentle stretching fixed the issue . 
  point being , my experience of chriopractors suggests that if * crack crack * is your only tool , everything will look the same . 
  see a physiotherapist instead . 
  as someone who has seen him live twice , i thoroughly , thoroughly recommend it . 
  fair point , edit added . 
  if that 's the case you should speak to a psychologist . 
  there 's no shame in it and it sounds like you can do with a bit of a hand in dealing with your distress . 
  that 's a good point , thanks . 
  thanks a lot . 
  my intuition was there but wanted to make sure i was n't wrong . 
  thanks,
