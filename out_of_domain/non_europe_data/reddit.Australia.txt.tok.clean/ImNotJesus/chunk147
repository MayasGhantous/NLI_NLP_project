  he has another ted talk too ( ca n't link , am at work ) and it 's also fantastic . 
  set yourself a goal like : ` each week i 'm going to try one new thing ' . 
  the worst thing that 'll happen to you is you have a bad taste for 5 seconds until you have a drink . 
  best thing that can happen is you have a whole new thing you can eat for the rest of your life !, 
  seems worth the risk . 
  you can even try to start having fun with it . 
  do some research on the best way to prepare that item . 
  it could be a great opportunity to learn about cooking ( an incredibly valuable life skill ), 
  i 'm an adult . 
  wait . . maybe the pope . 
  [ censored by sopa ] ( / spoiler ), 
  try to subtley touch his penis in conversation . 
  as far as i know, 
  chinese take-away, 
  this is too cheap but let 's try, 
  had the runs for days, 
  this is the only correct answer . 
  #### you monster, 
  i just gagged, 
  have you tried telling him that the way he talks to you sometimes upsets you but doing it in a calm manner when neither of you are upset already ? 
  try not to make it accusatory . 
  `` i know it 's hard when you have a bad day but sometimes i feel like you take it out on me . 
  i understand why you do it but i want to support you in those times and stay on the same team instead of fighting about things . 
  if you can try to make an effort to talk to me about why you 're upset , i promise to make an effort to be a source of support for you . '', 
  i wanted to clear up some confusion . 
  is it possible that your lack of enjoyment stems from a larger issue ? 
  what you 're describing is a very common symptom of depression . 
  depression is n't about sheer force of will . 
  it 's completely manageable and treatable but it sounds like you were very easily able to discover an area of disterss for yourself at the moment . 
  that kind of insight is very valuable in dealing with depression . 
  do you have the means to visit a psychologist to talk about it ? 
  sorry to hear that . 
  i ca n't convince you to go but there are good ones out there and one really , really helped me when i was depressed . 
  wish you the best of luck with it though . 
  silk panties . 
  they make my package look great . 
  in the backyard obviously, 
  i think you might have a ~ ~ website ~ ~ problem, 
  i do n't think fucking each other 's corpses is the answer . 
  that 's a really inappropriate suggestion . 
  it 's simple and easy . 
  you just need to get it out of your system by sleeping with her . 
  just let her know it does n't mean anything and it 's only because you think about her so much while masturbating . 
  she should understand . 
  i take both, 
  is she naked when she pops into your head ? 
  is she doing anything sexual ? 
  spoon full of vegemite, 
  you should probably just sleep with her, 
  dude it just happened once and now you 're thinking about it because it happened before . 
  it means nothing . 
  just ignore it and it 'll go away, 
  it 's true . 
  some other australians will back me up, 
  want to fuck ? 
  how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood ? 
  came up negative on an std test, 
  fantasise about going somewhere nice than alabama ? 
  fucking lottery dude, 
  if you feel like you need to talk to someone see a psych ** ologist ** not a psychiatrist for this as they 're far better trained in talk therapy . 
  it 's normal to be upset about feeling betrayed but that does n't necessarily mean you 're clinically depressed ( i can go through what the definition is if you need ) . 
  if you 're struggling to cope , talk to someone . 
  suicidal ideation , even if you have no plans to carry it out , can be a bit of a warning sign . 
  do you think you need to talk to someone about it ? 
  it can be . 
  that really depends on a lot of other factors . 
  if you have any concerns you should speak to someone . 
  fantasising may be meaningless but it may not be . 
  i ca n't say without knowing you . 
  hmmm in your psychology degree i think you missed a couple of classes on depression . 
  your knowledge is a tad spotty . 
  and when did i talk about chemical imbalance . 
  and if you had even the most basic knowledge of psychology you 'd know that it was a stupid suggestion . 
  mental health is still health . 
  i 'm not trying to be a cock but like you clearly do n't understand depression and you 're trying to give him mental health advice based on that lack of understanding . 
  it 's dangerous . 
  dude , in that whole essay about her being too fucked up at the moment to be in a relationship , the only thing you see good about her is that she 's hot . 
  either you 're incredibly insecure and shallow yourself or you need to get out . 
  you 're clearly totally different people . 
  why are you with her besides her being attractive ? 
  where 's your dropbear spirit ? 
  have you ever wondered if there was more to life , other than being really , really , ridiculously good looking ? 
  if it 's that big an issue you should try to ask her if she 'd feel comfortable talking about her body image concerns . 
  she may get value out of talking to a psychologist . 
  god giving me a bad review on yom kippur, 
  a lot of people have this idea that it makes them broken/a failure etc. 
  make sure she knows that it 's totally normal . 
  also , it 's not at all uncommon to not ` click ' with your first therapist . 
  it 's so , so important to find someone you have a good therapeutic alliance with . 
  ** all that being said ** , if you pressure her too much it may make her less likely to go . 
  the most important thing to remember is this : your job * is n't * to fix it . 
  your job is to love her and support her . 
  if she feels like you 're trying to fix her , it will only make her feel more insecure . 
  wack away, 
  have n't done it yet but on tuesday i 'm signing up to the bone marrow donor registry . 
  kinda scared but very excited . 
  thanks . 
  in australia they do the operation under a general anaesthetic and you often spend the night in hospital . 
  i 've been mulling it over for a while but i think i have to do it .
