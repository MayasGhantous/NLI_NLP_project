  [ evidence required ], 
   assuming ghosts are real, 
  you lost me, 
  if this is sincere i very strongly recommend you speak to a psychologist . 
   buys scientific evidence, 
  give me some proof that their information is wrong . 
  i guarantee you that the interest groups involved caused the peer-review to have * more * scrutiny , not less . 
  hey and a slight nod or go the half hug ( kinda lean in almost shoulder to shoulder ), 
  which is exactly why they 've cited who they 're getting contributions from so it 's all on the table . 
  science needs money from the business sector , there just is n't enough government funding to go around . 
  i have absolutely no problem with this as long as you make clear who 's giving contributions and it 's getting peer-reviewed . 
  you may have gripes about the paper itself but the fact that it 's partially funded by a group with a vested interest says nothing about the facts . 
  why did you make your books so inconsistent and full of holes ? 
  not using a rubber . 
  listen up kiddies : if she 's willing to not use a condom , you want to wear a condom, 
  i am the 1 % ama, 
  you 're so stupid . 
  she invented janitors, 
  `` what 's the holocaust '', 
  21 year old girl, 
  only if it 's a christian toilet amirite ??? 
  i 'm right, 
  no but i have his powers . 
  i was bitten by a radioactive jesus and ever since i 've been able to walk on water, 
  again , that does n't instantly preclude the study from being correct . 
  i 'm not an expert on the topic myself so i ca n't talk to the veracity of the data but the people who peer-reviewed it are . 
  if you have any reason to think the study itself is false , i suggest you write the journal . 
  try [ this ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=shark+finning+location ), 
  am ... am i a terrorist now ? 
  men say `` my son '' or `` my daughter '' at times too . 
  you 're being overly sensitive . 
  you 're confusing the frontpage or r/politics with what the average person actually says/thinks . 
  / r/politics is a bigger circlejerk than / r/atheism, 
  yes but he would get sick without getting vitamins and minerals . 
  there was a famous study on this . 
  are you one of them there communist terrorist types ? 
  if you try to lie or bullshit , they will know . 
  if you hide shit , i guarantee you it will end in more treatment . 
  went interstate with a group of friends for the weekend ( for the first time the ufc came to australia ) . 
  we all booked our flights/tickets to the event well in advance and until a day before i still was n't sure that x was coming and he still had n't reimbursed me for buying his ticket online . 
  we finally leave and get to sydney , only to realise that he came with a backpack that had some spare clothes , a giant bag of pistachios and , of course , no money at all . 
  we would go to a cafe and he would sit there eating pistachios , looking sad , until someone offered to buy him food . 
  after the event finished we all went to the airport . 
  we all had different flights back , except for x who had ** still not planned a return flight ** . 
  he then borrowed my phone ( his had no charge/charger ) to call his parents and argue with them in the middle of the airport , asking them to buy him a trip home . 
  he then gets angry and hangs up with no flight . 
  they then call back , talk to me and eventually got him onto a flight ( he was 21 at the time ) . 
  now , the friend who drove us in was parked at a different airport to the one he was landing in so his plan was to get a flight to tullamarine ( the main airport in melbourne ) and then take a bus to the other airport . 
  anyway , 3 hours later my flight is set to leave and i take it home by myself . 
  i land at the airport to see him waiting at the gate saying : `` i could n't find a bus to the avalon , so i thought i 'd wait here until you landed and get a lift with you '' . 
  i was getting a lift home from my girlfriend and this was the first of my friends she met . 
  tl ; dr friend came interstate with no money and no flight home, 
  look under the machine, 
  i think it 's much more sad to actually care, 
  what are you interested in generally ? 
  what do you do for fun ? 
  what do you like to learn about ( do you watch documentaries ? 
  listen to informative podcasts ), 
  try to sleep with megan fox, 
  it 's simple . 
  all you need to do is [ censored by sopa ] ( / spoiler ), 
  open a fucking book and do some homework, 
  hey jude, 
  i 'd fall out after 3 humps, 
  if you were keen for ` conversation ' surely you could 've thought of a more interesting question, 
  ** i am vehemently against sopa **, 
  however , in the list of the ` least likely news headlines ever ' , `` congress votes down sopa after not being able to reddit for an afternoon '' comes just after `` israeli university receives funding to start project resurrect hitler '' . 
  i get the sentiment but it 's really quite pointless . 
  i get that you want to do something and you 're welcome to put a big banner up the top or write your congressman or whatever but there is no way that closing down askreddit makes any significant difference . 
   i believe it 's a toss up . 
  dr. j is n't top 10 all-time . 
  you 're an idiot, 
  many jews consider it to b a part of their identity but are n't religious observant ( beyond a few minor customs ) . 
  culturally jewish . 
  you wear clothes when you reddit ? 
  we have [ drop bears ] ( http://australianmuseum.net.au/drop-bear ) . 
  they 're fucking terrifying .

  i just threw up in my mouth a little, 
  should be ryan gosling . 
  will be kathy bates, 
  of all the places to make sacrifices for the environment , genital cleanliness would be pretty low down on my list . 
  how many times are you using that cloth ? 
  i think euthanasia * is * humane . 
  why should n't someone have the right to die in that situation . 
  we 're not talking about someone who is mentally ill taking their own life , we 're talking about someone whose life is constant torture with no sign of anything changing . 
  i think the people that try to stop euthanasia are ** incredibly ** selfish . 
  / r/trianglejerk, 
  there are plenty of doctors who would willingly up a morphine dose and let a patient go quietly if they had the opportunity to . 
  either way , no-one is going to force a doctor to do it . 
  as for the right mindset , it 's not very hard to devise methods of determining that . 
  we already have plenty . 
  we determine if they 're mentally sound to make that decision or if they 've elected to do so well before becoming unfit to make that decision ( in the same we we have dnr orders ), 
  clearly doctors would need to sign off on it, 
  no it becomes the doctors decision whether or not you are terminally ill and in significant pain . 
  that 's a decision they make every day . 
  doctors constantly make those decisions though and they * do * have life or death implications . 
  would you really condemn millions of people to constant pain for few of some incredibly small number of mistakes ? 
  that 's like saying `` we should n't use chemo anymore because if we 're wrong we could kill the patient '' .
