  i know this is a random question but would yao have a big cock because he 's tall or a tiny cock because he 's asian . 
  it could just be average sized but that 's a boring answer . 
  i love that they 're always life coaches too . 
  i can imagine the first session :, 
   `` all you need to do is say you 're a quantum something and then people give you money . 
  it 's awesome '', 
  when you need something , in your box, 
  and you just , do n't know what, 
  pick the choice that really rocks ,, 
  it 's schroe-dingers cock da dum dum, 
  correlates with *, 
  if you 're going to be a pedant , do it right, 
  holy shit , in reverse you can actually see it in her throat, 
  was thinking this might be fake until i saw this post . 
  falling asleep randomly = cataplexy not narcolepsy . 
  dear god i hope you 're right because if so that story is amazing, 
  i have no idea good sir , i 'm just riding the karma train . 
  perhaps saying cock gets you upvotes ? 
  everything is structured for smoke on the water, 
  my cholesterol hates you for this, 
  [ ] ( / fy1 `` fertilised , bitch '' ), 
  [ ] ( / son `` son , what 's that '' ), 
  [ ] ( / fap `` enjoy the show '' ), 
  i guess you could say ... 
  ** puts on sunglasses **, 
  they got rickroll 'd, 
  likes on facebook ? 
  a wild champion appears, 
  it uses epic trolley turning, 
  it is super effective, 
  bonus 20 points if you hit an old lady and still make the turn, 
  in australia , we speak english , not american . 
  was n't having a go at you good sir , just adding to your point . 
  do you know what a freudian slip is ? 
  it 's when you mean one thing but say your mother, 
  [ ] ( / fap `` so did i '' ), 
  spoiler alert ... the titanic sinks, 
  yet each time i hear it there 's one more pig, 
  winston churchill : history will be kind to me because i intend to write it . 
  i laughed then hated myself . 
  well played sir, 
  exactly . 
  occam 's razor is a very valid piece of logic in a discussion of god and was used correctly in that context . 
  if there is no evidence you dismiss points that adds more questions than it answers - this is the key element . 
  in talking about how the universe started `` the big bang happened '' requires further questions and more information . 
  `` the big bang happened because an omnipotent being who cares about whether or not you touch yourself '' requires a lot more questions and a lot more information to make sense and thereby needs ** more ** proof . 
   try posting that in r/atheism , i think they would mutually fap to it in a circle . 
  ftfy, 
  okay are we done now ? 
  we get it , you think r/atheism is a circlejerk because a subreddit designed for people who share a belief or common interest ( you know , like every single subreddit ever created ) tend to have the same beliefs and common interests . 
  ** oh my god **, 
  go on then ... 
  do n't worry , he knows how to bloc all his punches . 
  that 's me in the spot ... light, 
  ** losing my religion **, 
  what do you mean ? 
  r/politics is only 98 % democrats, 
  and omg look at r/skeptic they should have just called it r/homeopathy bashing i ca n't believe how heartless they are, 
  i was agreeing pal , twas a joke, 
  i do n't have a hairy back ... 
  [ ] ( / megusta `` i do have a hairy ass though '' ), 
  ummm ... well ... uhhh ... doggone it . 
  i got nothing . 
  hot dog ? 
  redditor for 1 year , 8 months . 
  most depressing thing i 've ever read . 
  twilight would make me smile after that, 
  oh my , it appears he was n't too good at [ spanish ] ( http://twitter.com/#!/shanebattier/status/69269228326354944 ) either, 
  and it 's that kind of persistence that earns you upvotes !, 
  i laughed , i cried , i learnt something . 
  still waiting on my mark sorry, 
  the part of the conversation we did n't see ... 
  you want cyber ? 
  lol , law and order svu wikipedia page is favourited, 
  dude , my girlfriend gets so proud of herself if she can fart in front of me, 
  nice job topping off the picture, 
  it becomes less insightful if it says '' ... most people wo n't pass this on but my friends know enough about relationships to think it should be . '', 
  after it, 
  to be clear ; it 's the first time they 've shared a podium according to dennett, 
  there are some in australia, 
  did you just google `` weirdest boner '' ? 
  if so , bravo, 
  depends on location and willingness to hurt other people . 
  there 's no way i could drive that fast near where i live without having a massive accident . 
  how about uncle touchy ? 
  please for the love of god do n't go to r/seduction if you actually want a relationship . 
  please . 
  if your entire hope in life is to pick up chicks and fuck them then go right ahead . 
  if you want a real relationship throw game out the window and just be yourself . 
  it sounds trite but you just do n't get a real relationship by trying to manipulate someone . 
  totally , online dating is a numbers game . 
  this is the first time i 've upvoted him but i think it wo n't be the last, 
  i printed it out and stuck it above my bed so i can see it when i lie in bed at night . 
  i was told it 's okay as long as i do n't make eye contact . 
  i 'm still straight right ? 
  agreed . 
  twilight is unwatchable . 
  it had nothing to do with your bustiness ? 
  plus she needs you there as a parental guardian, 
  especially because it 's supposed to bring back 4x as much in tourism haha,
