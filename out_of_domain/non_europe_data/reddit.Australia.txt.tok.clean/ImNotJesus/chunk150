  honours currently . 
  not doing a pure phd . 
  psychology doctorate ( at least where i go ) does masters coursework while doing a thesis concurrently . 
  what did you do your phd on ? 
  very cool . 
  make sure you do some research into what papers they 've published recently before going for the interview . 
  you can find it pretty easily on their website normally . 
  in australia , tobacco accounts for 80 % of drug and alcohol related deaths . 
  that being said , banning e-cigs is very stupid . 
  `` get the fuck out of my bedroom '', 
  do n't go back . 
  if you 're suffering from a depression you should speak to a psychologist . 
  it 's a manageable and treatable condition that a good psychologist will greatly help you with . 
  suffering from depression is different to ` feeling down ' . 
  if you 're having a bad day , try doing some exercise or something else positive . 
  play the lottery, 
  i think you 're both incredibly naive to think it 's as simple as one or the other . 
  there are a bunch of factors ( including mental health issues , drug abuse , abusive parents , poor luck etc. ), 
  that ca n't easily be split into `` at fault '' and `` not at fault '' . 
  my job is grammar nazi . 
   whose, 
  hmm do i go to college or learn a trade ? 
  i might as well just sleep on a park bench until i can work it out . 
  edit : poster above me said something to the extent of `` some people just do n't know what to do with their lives '', 
  or the most forgotten about ( and vulnerable ) homeless group : abused women who left their partners . 
  often they have kids and live in cars . 
  very limited availabilty . 
  also , homeless women have incredibly high rates of being sexually abused while homeless . 
  most of them are n't willing to go . 
  `` yeh , all night and now it hurts to pee '', 
  accidentally sent to my mum . 
  it 's a huge issue because they 're so regularly abused and are forced to either go back to their partner or live in horrible conditions on the street with their kids . 
  no scientific discovery can disprove that ` a ' god exists ( especially as it 's a poorly defined term - would a sufficiently advanced alien be a god ? ) . 
  however , it is fairly simple to prove beyond reasonable doubt that specific gods do n't exist . 
  studies tend to show that extroverts are happier than introverts ( there are plenty of negatives though ) . 
  sorry if that made it sound like i was correcting you , i was just adding information . 
  do n't have anything on me ( i 'm at work ) but i study psych and it 's fairly well accepted . 
  there are tonnes of happiness measures that are used in different sorts of experiments . 
  that obviously depends on context and your own means . 
  i 'll still try to do things to make my kids live 's easier even if they 're totally self-sufficient . 
  it 's not a question of when/how much , it 's a question of self-sufficiency . 
  found a small container that used to have raw egg in it . 
  had been sitting there for about 3 weeks . 
  the smell was overwhelming . 
  in terms of the psychological side of this debate , the general consensus is that genetics provide the outer barriers of who you are/what you 're capable of , and environment decides where you fall in that spectrum . 
  for example , iq heritability is about 50 % ( some say up to 80 % but that 's fairly fringe ) and will provide an ` outer limit ' of what one will achieve but without proper nutrition , education , parental engagement etc. 
  the number will be significantly smaller . 
  before peeing becomes a challenge . 
  i love my life at the moment but all the best things in my life are still ahead of me ( marrying my soon-to-be wife , having children and watching them grow up , finishing my doctorate , practicing as a psychologist and helping change people 's lives , seeing who my kids become , having more financial freedom , not caring if i wear sweat pants , being able to say `` back in my day '' without sounding like a dick , letting myself go , people having to listen to my stories , having grandchildren , seeing what the world will be like in 50 years , seeing who my partner becomes , growing as a person , going through all the ups and downs that make life worth living etc. ), 
  tl ; dr most of it, 
  edit : thanks for asking the question . 
  realising how much joy i have ahead of me has given me a huge smile . 
  you may get a better response on / r/askscience, 
  while i 'm glad that you 're happy , studies like that are talking about averages . 
  it does n't mean that all introverts are less happy than all extroverts . 
  i 'm happy to go into the intimate details of test reliability and validity if you 'd like but no measure is perfect and it is possible that your definition of happiness differs slightly from the one used by the myriad of tests . 
  however , the tests are useful if they are * consistent * and make * useful predictions * . 
  [ apparently you gave him too much credit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/oc3g4/introverts_vs_extroverts_do_you_think_youre/c3g244t ), 
  i suffered from quite a severe depression for many years and only came out the other side because of a great therapist . 
  i really look forward to having the opportunity to give as many people the same chance at happiness as he gave me . 
  ca n't look at imgur at work :(, 
  there 's no rules . 
  told my girlfriend after 10 days ( we spent almost every minute together ) and we 're still together . 
  if it feels right ( and you 're sure it 's not just you getting wrapped up in the moment ) , just do it . 
  they ban imgur and not reddit . 
  it 's like a slap in the fucking face every day . 
  yes . 
  there 's lots of great things going on at the moment giving your relationship a wonderful glow and making it feel more perfect than it is . 
  it 's normal and wonderful but just try to , every so often , look objectively at the situation and work out what proportion of your happiness is the wonderful newness or other traps and what is genuine love for her . 
  for example , you 've said that you 've said it to girls before . 
  do you get a bit carried away when you receive affection because of how wonderful it makes you feel ( ie. , are you in love or do you love to * feel * loved ) ? 
  clearly the latter, 
  firstly , you ca n't possibly say that research into cosmetic genetic engineering wo n't have possible benefits in other areas . 
  secondly , all ( ethically responsible , ie. , doing no harm ) research should be allowed . 
  you can argue about implementation but the research is always valid . 
  if you asked if it should be legal to * practice * , that 's a very different question . 
  i can physically taste your bitterness, 
  because no baggage handlers have to put you on to the plane . 
  you 're not paying more because you 're ` weighing down the plane ' or something, 
  they wo n't actually sue you because they ca n't show damages . 
  however , there 's nothing you can do to get a good recommendation beyond talking to her and just trying to explain that you were upset and apologise . 
  nice try , criminal mastermind . 
  so sick of that crap . 
  by all objective measures we live in , ** by far ** , the best age that has ever existed . 
  we live in the most peaceful , most fair and have more access to health , happiness and self-fulfillment than any people that have ever lived . 
  edit : since i 'm being downvoted with no-one actually giving me any facts . 
  1 ) i have access to better medicine than the richest man in the world did 50 years ago . 
  2 ) i can access the world 's best information from my home . 
  3 ) you had a 3 % chance of dying to violence in the 20th century ( note several world wars and genocide ) compared to the ** 15 % ** historical figure . 
  4 ) rural 3rd world communities are now having the same iq increases that western cities are having ( flynn effect ) because they have the same access to nutrition and literacy . 
  5 ) life expectancies worldwide are far higher than they 've ever been . 
  6 ) vaccines prevent life-threatening illnesses all over the world, 
  i could go on and on ... 
  see my edit for some examples . 
  unless , of course , you would prefer to make assumptions about my udnerstanding of the topic without actually talking factually . 
  your call . 
  your criticism of me was that i had no understanding of things outside of my `` own first world comfort zone '' ( which is odd because you had no idea where i come from ) and now you say that you 're worried about overpopulation ? 
  so , basically , you think it 's bad that we provide healthcare because you 're worried about running out of resources , in a few centuries . 
  right . 
  i 'm the one with the lack of perspective .
