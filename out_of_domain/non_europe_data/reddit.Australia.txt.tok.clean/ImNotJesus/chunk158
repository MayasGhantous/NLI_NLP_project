  it 's one thing to stay friends with your exes but it 's another to make you feel uncomfortable about it . 
  if you 're a bit bigger you have to use lube and start slowly, 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  what you need is some convoluted line or a gimmick . 
  others have suggested good things but if it 's possible , you should try to get to a psychologist . 
  it 's the best long-term solution right now . 
  it does tend to make the conversation better but each to their own, 
  it 's pronounced whale, 
  give him a small bell and tell him every time he rings it he gets a sexual favour of his liking . 
  i allways seem to press my l key twice when typing the word allways, 
  so brave, 
  at least they have to go through the fda to prove that it actually works/won ' t kill people before they can sell it . 
  i care much more about assholes who sell homeopathy and `` natural '' medicine, 
  you 're about 65 years late pal, 
  except you ca n't get it without going to the doctor who should be the one saying `` no you do n't need it '', 
  makes ** all businesses in the ** world go ` round ... and ` round and ` round ... 
  ftfy, 
  as a guy , i expect to pay . 
  that being said , i expect her to at least offer or buy something small ( like if we went out for ice-cream after the meal or something ) to show me that she is n't taking it for granted . 
  i want to live where you live if that 's the case . 
  they 're different ? 
  wow til, 
  holy shit . 
  in melbourne , i 'll pay $ 400 for a terrible , run-down unit in a half-decent area in the suburbs . 
  been looking at buying a place like that ( $ 650 p/w mortgage ) and we 'd get about $ 350 a week rent out of it . 
  you people are fucking nuts if you do n't buy . 
  i 'm so , so jealous . 
  that purely depends on whether you read / r/politics like it 's at all factual . 
  australia, 
  both . 
  in australia people buy investment properties much more and the housing prices are way higher . 
  if mortgage was = to rent payments , everyone here would buy it . 
  you 're a terrible , terrible person . 
  interesting ... masturbating in the same house as you when you have n't had sex yet is bold . 
  why order of words in sentence what they are ? 
  only on reddit do some claim there 's a media bias and poor reporting by quoting a leftist blog . 
  1 ) people do n't always make decisions that are in their best interests, 
  2 ) rules and structure lead to greater overall prosperity ( e.g. , advanced trade ), 
  3 ) people do n't always act in the interests of others . 
  knock knock, 
  who 's there ? 
  interrupting cow, 
  interrup ... 
  ** moooooooooo **, 
  does it cost roughly a buck ` o'five ? 
  your school/college/university will probably have a way to log in , through their library , so that you can see them . 
  that really depends on how you define nature . 
  society is part of nature . 
  besides anything else , just saying that it 's `` nature '' does n't mean that it 's good . 
  surely they do n't expect you to buy access to journal articles , that 'd be insane . 
  you should ask them . 
  this is the right subreddit since you 're asking a scientific question . 
  i 'm looking for an answer but i 'm yet to find anything concrete . 
  there are strong correlations between depression and introversion and depression and neuroticism ( kotov , gamez , schmidt & watson ) . 
  however , i could n't find anything that conclusively linked iq and depression . 
  hope that 's a helpful starting point . 
  found it through my university library so the link would do you little good . 
  just google `` kotov , gamez , schmidt & watson '' and you 'll find at least an abstract . 
  if you need any help understanding the terminology , just yell out, 
  i think you 're having a stroke . 
  7 + / - 2 is generally considered to be the figure . 
  i 'm sorry someone hurt you, 
  edit : for those wondering , he said `` nothing is worse than seeing this kind of faggotry on reddit '' before he editted his post . 
  was n't correcting , was just adding some extra info for those interested . 
  i 'm just a psych nerd who loves teaching people about it , no disrespect intended . 
  masturbating too hard is actually really bad for you . 
  you can develop traumatic masturbatory syndrome ( or similar name , am at work and not googling it ) and you can lose sensitivity . 
  it 's your friend , be nice to it . 
  that 's why chunking and semantic linking are so important . 
  you can remember 5-9 separate things but those things can be complicated , as long as you study it in the right way . 
  i love creating mnemonics for myself and often have competitions between my friends to see who can come up with the funniest one . 
  hopefully never . 
  why would n't we want to protect people who create unique content ? 
  there are smarter ways of doing it than sopa/pipa etc. 
  but that does n't mean it should n't be done at all . 
  / r/politics, 
  what he 's actually referring to is called ` working memory ' . 
  working memory is how many pieces of information you can keep in your mind at one time and this number is considered to be 7 + / - 2 . 
  however , there is no limit to how complex those pieces of information can be . 
  for example , if i told you to remember 14552512 and read it out slowly , you may remember each number individually , repeating 14552512 in your head and this would count for 8 pieces . 
  if you remember it at 145 525 12 , you can remember it as 3 and have more room in your working memory . 
  this is called chunking . 
  short-term memory is actually slightly different . 
  working memory ( and the number he quoted , which is why i knew he meant to say working memory ) relate to the number of items that you can hold in your mind and manipulate at any given time . 
  short-term memory refers to memory that is held for a short period of time but not necessarily encoded into long-term memory . 
  you * are * friendly . 
  well doing things comes under a different category ( multitasking is complicated but i 'm happy to teach you some stuff about that if you 're interested ) . 
  it more refers to the number of items you can maintain mental attention on at a time . 
  the best example is trying to remember a list of words . 
  if i gave you a list of a whole bunch of different words you were trying to remember , the number you 'd be able to remember ( unless you were concentrating on something else at the same time ) would be 5-9 . 
  you 'd also be far more likely to remember the ones at the start ( primacy effect ) and the end ( recency effect ) of the list . 
  oh , so it 's a psych-off then ? 
  do n't forget rehearsal as you 'll increase your chances of it become a part of short-term memory . 
  also , the first few and last few will be the easiest to remember to use the greatest cognitive effort on the ones in the middle of the list . 
  i may not be jesus but i did get an hd in both of my cognitive psychology units, 
  oh , high distinction ( over 80 % ) , thought that was a term used in other countries too . 
  no problems at all . 
  you should try / r/asksocialscience, 
  i do n't go on / r/atheism but here 's why i think it * should * be on the frontpage :, 
  the whole point of reddit is that you get the material that the majority want .
