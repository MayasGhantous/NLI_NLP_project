  it 's very easy to unsubscribe from a subreddit and you can even block it in res if you want . 
  however , given the fact that it 's one of the most popular subreddits , why * should n't * it be on the frontpage ? 
  clearly , enough people want to see it that it should be there . 
  i think there are plenty of subreddits that are waste of time circlejerks but if people want to see it , people want to see it . 
  with reddit you get the content people want . 
  if you think that / r/atheism is pointless , make an atheism subreddit that works the way ** you ** want it to work . 
  if enough people agree it will be on the frontpage one day instead . 
  ps : the reason it was taken off the frontpage was n't that there was an issue with the content , it was actually because people were being cocks and starting flamewars . 
  tl ; dr people like it , it deserves to be there . 
  and / r/politics does n't ? 
  i believe it wad done by subscribers at the point at which it was updated . 
  / r/askscience was added too but removed temporarily at the mods ' request . 
  you 're going to have to define the word progress . 
  if you 're talking about physical health , we 've done very well in the last 100 years . 
  violence is also ** way ** down ( see steven pinker 's new book ) . 
  what specific measures are you using ? 
  / r/politics has more circlejerking selfposts than actual content posts and they vilify a large subsection of the population . 
  go on ther and tell them that bush was a great president and see what happens, 
  you only listed 8 . 
  6 of the top 10 are self-posts including one suporting a guy heckling a presidential candidate during his speech, 
  point is , it does n't matter . 
  as soon as admins start saying which content `` deserves '' to be on the front page , it stops being reddit . 
  they took the most popular ones and added them to the defaults . 
  / r/asksocialscience is also good, 
  there 's a neuroscientific reason for this actually . 
  in neuroplasticity ( brain structure change to respond to changed needs ) there are what we call ` critical periods ' , that is there are periods where there is far quicker adaptation to a specific skill set than all other times in development . 
  for language , this happens quite young ( for obvious , adaptive reasons ) . 
  it is still possible to learn a langauge after this point but as it 's not during the critical period , it is significantly slower . 
  ignore him ... 
  sure you can . 
  just do n't respond . 
  i grew up in a jewish family and used to be proud of it . 
  a guy at school started telling me that he thought hitler was awesome and wished that he did an even better job, 
  despite getting decent marks , i really regret not learning good study habits/skills when i was in highschool . 
  now that i 'm in university , and i actually care , i really wish i 'd learned how to sit and study . 
  i lost 45kg ( 100lbs ) after high school and have put a decent chunk of it back on . 
  i got mono and when i was stuck on the couch for months my diet/exercise went to shit . 
  very . 
  i 'll tell you anything you like, 
   when free speech is finally censored from the internet, 
  i do n't agree with your presupposition . 
  i do n't think it 's likely that the internet gets completely censored . 
  tinfoil hats are a * must *, 
   obvious grammarly errors in reddit headlines . 
  ftfy, 
  no , i just play him in musicals some times . 
  nice try , espn 's legal team . 
  if i had a choice between only listening to dubstep/house or justine bieber for the rest of my life , i 'd end up with bieber fever, 
  i feel older, 
  the rise of emotional intelligence and how it will allow great human happiness and mental health awareness !, 
  i ca n't find my top comment but my top submission is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b07h1.jpg ) at +1845 . 
  number 2 is [ this ] ( http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110419/news01/304190110/highlands-church-changes-policy-marriages-until-state-changes-its-stand?odyssey=tab | topnews | text | home ) on / r/atheism ( who says they 're a circlejerk ) with +1713, 
  emotional maturity and stage of life are far more important than physical age . 
  instead of just boycotting , write an e-mail . 
  there are two types of love ; passionate and companionate . 
  passionate refers to the ` spark ' , the intense feelings of emotion , physical attraction etc. 
  companionate refers to intimacy/trust/closeness . 
  when they 're combined , you get consumate love - this is the most fulfilling and powerful type of love . 
  it 's fairly normal to have more passionate than companionate love at the start of the relationship but as time goes on , it will change in composition . 
  i hate having my nipples touched so no, 
  if you 're suffering from depression you should be seeing a psychologist and discussing this with him/her . 
  best of luck, 
  you 're correct . 
  there are a bunch of different models but i thought that would be the easiest to explain . 
  that really depends on how each person defines the `` spark '' . 
  if they 're defining it by intense emotions , often felt at the start of a relationship ( due to a flood of dopamine if you 're interested ) then it will often be felt early but will wither . 
  if by spark they mean that they feel a closeness and ease in conversation , it 's more likely to sign of something deeper ( both are important but only one is sustainable ) . 
  how does he define the `` spark '' ? 
  i 'm not ruben , but i did downvote you . 
  jeff buckley at any of his sin-e gigs, 
  queen at wembley is a close 2nd, 
  i 'm sorry that you 've had a bad experience but they can and do help . 
  it 's important to find one that suits you as there are different types of therapists and not all people like all types of therapy . 
  do you mind me asking what you did n't like ? 
  a quick look through my personality textbook did n't find anything . 
  the closest i found in terms of research is a paper that showed extroverts performed significantly better under noise disturbance than introverts . 
  you could say that that indicates cognitive effort but i do n't know that it would be significant enough to cause physical fatigue . 
  my instinct still says anxiety and that you may not always be aware of the anxiety . 
  the other thought i had was a 3rd variable issue . 
  for example , perhaps introverts may go out late at night less regularly and are n't used to it .

  healthcare is n't even free . 
  why the fuck would n't that be a bigger priority ? 
  i 'm getting your brave juice all over my face, 
  as noted by nowhereplans , the questions are appropriate but / r/asksocialscience does exist and there are some great topics too !, 
  be careful with how much stock you take in some of jung 's theories . 
  he 's fascinating but not a lot of it has good evidence behind it . 
  while their show is one of my favourites , it 's hardly scientific evidence . 
  they also play fairly fast and loose with the truth at times ( their obesity episode was horrendous ) . 
  i would definitely kill justin bieber because i really hate it when talent people who work hard make music for a different demographic than myself . 
  death is the only fair outcome . 
  chocolate milk because fuck you it 's delicious . 
  sounds like your brother should stop being a bully,

  people who do n't know how to use the [ search function ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=pet+peeve&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  bottle of wine . 
  audiobooks and podcasts . 
  i find them way more distracting . 
  by all objective measures we live in the best times that have ever existed .
