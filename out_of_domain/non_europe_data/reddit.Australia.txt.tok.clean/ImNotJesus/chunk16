  i do n't but just incase someone really silly ( like someone from a country that does n't have many spanish speakers ) does , how should it be pronounced ? 
  [ ] ( / foreveralone `` well okay , it was my house , blowup doll in the bed and my mum that found me on the couch '' ), 
  really ? 
  awww that 's so sweet, 
  what ? 
  huh ? 
  there 's a backlash because there has been increasing levels of publicity about it and people are realising what actually goes on . 
  i had n't heard about it until about a month ago . 
  can anyone ever be sure that they are n't jesus ? 
   why should n't islam make objective moral claims if science or humanism can ? 
  his whole point is that they are making those claims , even if they 're implicit . 
  saying `` in our society all women must live in cloth bags '' is promoting a lifestyle that has objective pros/cons and it 's naive to ignore them because they come alongside religion . 
  the point is , a sufficiently developed understanding of human well-being should be able to objectively say ; idea a will lead to a more progressed or happier or whatever society than idea b. 
  the point is that if you try to be the type of person you think she wants you find someone who wants something that is n't you . 
  seconded . 
  we need a mod asap, 
  christian goes in , christine goes out . 
  you ca n't explain that, 
  sorry captain internets , i forgot to ask you first . 
  we have this amazing new system in reddit , it 's called upvotes . 
  what you do is , if you like an idea or think something is funny you upvote it . 
  if you do n't well , you just downvote it . 
  then what happens is the ideas people like float to the top and people getting annoyed about trivial things gets buried . 
  i understand that it would be very upsetting for you if there was a background ( there is n't actually one at the moment ) but i think you can probably manage . 
  by far my favourite novelty, 
  wait i deserve one too now , ooo do me , do me . 
  [ ] ( / melvin `` i just have res '' ), 
  meany, 
  but , but , the gustafly is beautiful and majestic, 
  on what grounds were they complaining ? 
  i do n't really understand how it affects them if they do n't like it . 
  you should n't do drugs , cause drugs are * bad * mmmkayyyy, 
  how is it marketing bullshit ? 
  9 of the teams are actually from melbourne since that 's where most football fans live . 
  maybe cloakzore is the man in the picture . 
  one gets comment karma , the other link karma ... it 's the perfect crime . 
  or ones like `` ididntgetthejoke '' who makes some random unfunny comment followed by people posting `` haha people that downvoted did n't read the username '' . 
  no , i downvoted because it was a stupid novelty and added nothing to my day . 
  someone made a hole in my ceiling and it seems to be raining on my cheeks, 
  fappable , not fappable , fappable , not fappable , fappable , not fappable , fappable , finished, 
  i bet no-one has ever responded that to one of his comments, 
  if i were would i say yes ? 
  because you can make it display all alt-text, 
  [ ] ( / troll `` shh do n't tell him , we can pretend 2000 people hate him '' ), 
  [ ] ( / awyeah `` you worked out the faces ! '' ), 
  false !, 
  i bought my wife on the internet . 
  me and tatiana are very happy, 
  that 's why she was so expensive, 
  real vomit , it 's lube . 
  the odds of me clicking a link after my post says : `` real vomit , it 's lube . '', 
  are very , very , very , low, 
  laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame, 
  look at me i can make a username and then do what it says hahahaa comedy gold, 
  do n't hold back , tell me what you really think, 
  on that note , fuck cnn too for reporting this article . 
  dae get a little mini orgasm every time he cleared 4 lines, 
  that should be the sequel to gone in 60 seconds ... fapped in 43 seconds, 
  it is if they 're paying by the hour, 
  what do you have to do to achieve it ? 
  jesus is back ... and this time ... 
  he 's cross, 
  i did n't know that vader originally came from kansas, 
  shit !, 
  it 's trinity, 
  that 's totally my jam, 
  or the girl has really low self-esteem and thinks she ca n't do better . 
  thank god for daddy issues, 
  he 's probably blind and his friends are dicks, 
  you ca n't fap to that ? 
  shame , shame , shame . 
  i 'm really good at winning prizes by being the 1,000,000 th visitor to a website . 
  have an orangered from me , sir, 
  broke my right wrist , had to learn how to adapt . 
  i 'm not the messiah , i 'm just a very naughty boy, 
  the skies are clear as of 10:08 am, 
  actually not a novelty but you 'd be surprised how often i get bonus karma just for the name, 
  best 8 seconds of strobe i 've ever seen, 
  i really hope you replied to his post because of your/his usernames , because , well , it 's just beautiful . 
  the holocaust was unpleasant, 
  i think that you 're safe because you 're also wearing a rubber, 
  the point is n't that the students prayed . 
  the faculty did n't stop them . 
  no-one turned off a mic , no-one told her to stop . 
  faculty were complicit by inaction . 
  this sounds like a crazy idea but maybe instead of asking strangers on the internet you should consider talking to him about it . 
  he 's probably stressed/tired/upset about something or any number of other reasons . 
  we could all guess but he would probably have a better idea . 
  besides that , do you ever initiate or try to romance him ? 
  `` get your hand out of your pants '', 
  neil patrick harris, 
  ** boooo **, 
  understandable . 
  have you tried things like offering him a backrub or doing little nice things for him to get him a bit relaxed instead of propositioning him ( he may feel pressured if he knows that you want it more than him at the moment ) ?
