  i 'm happy with what i got . 
  also , contact a supervisor/manager that will vouch for your work ethic or other relevant skills, 
  because what you 're saying is n't just stupid , it 's potentially harmful . 
  `` why are the negros sitting near the whites ? '', 
  did n't mean to insinuate you woud ever listen , you seem like a thoughtful person . 
  i more meant to say that the * attitude * is potentially harmful . 
  do nothing . 
  not only is it not your place to intervene but it also completely undermines the mother and is likely to end with you being the bad guy . 
  you have no idea what 's going on , how commonly this happens and what other circumstances there are . 
  ps : i 'll be downvoted for this but there 's an incredible number of studies that show corporal punishment is ** not ** an effective strategy and has several negative side-effects . 
  edit : [ meta-analysis of 88 studies into corporal punishment ] ( http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep02/corporal.aspx ), 
  corporal punishment as a behaviour modification strategy in parenting . 
  [ meta-analysis of 88 studies that shows corporal punishment is a bad long-term behaviour change strategy and has several negative side-effects ] ( http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep02/corporal.aspx ), 
  edit : i 'll explain helix400 's criticism better than i did . 
  the reason the article claims `` in a commentary in the same journal , diana baumrind , phd , robert e. larzelere , phd , and philip a cowan , phd , argue that the data are too unclear to warrant a blanket injunction against all corporal punishment . '', 
  is not for the reasons that helix400 is suggesting ( it helps to actually read the review paper instead of reading 2 lines about it and assuming it conforms to your already held beliefs on the issue ) . 
  if you read the * actual * review paper , written by the authors in question , they suggest that as those who use cp are primarily those who exhibit ** other bad parenting techniques ** , and suggest that it 's unclear that cp itself causes the negative outcomes . 
  the point remains that there are negative outcomes associated with parents who use cp , they just argued that it 's unclear that cp itself causes it . 
  as a result of that , they do n't think the evidence is clear enough to unambiguously outlaw cp as it could be caused by the other poor parenting strategies . 
  at absolute best , this suggests that the negative side effects are n't caused by the cp itself ( although i would n't agree with that based on their review paper ) but it still does n't suggest that it is an * effective * behaviour change strategy . 
  edit # 2 : to all those messaging me with something to the extent of `` i was hit as a child and i turned out fine/deserved it/wouldn ' t be where i am today '' i understand that that 's your subjective experience of your childhood and i have no intentions to argue that you had bad parents . 
  please understand that this study is simply looking at the efficacy , on average , of cp as a behaviour modification strategy and not an attack on your personal experience/childhood . 
  this is a massive problem and a lot of people think it 's a big part of why recidivism rates are so high . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean , sorry . 
  i think you misread what i posted . 
  i said * corporal * punishment . 
  when i used to play wow , i suffered from rsi . 
  i edited to clarify . 
  addressed your same concern in my edit, 
  in australia it 's illegal . 
  or you can just teach them to use a condom . 
  while i understand that your personal experience was not traumatic , that does n't mean it 's an effective strategy or that it does n't hurt the parent-child relationship . 
  i completely agree though that a small amount of spanking is very different to aggressive outbursts . 
  i 'm not glad i was cut . 
  i almost died from blood loss as a result and now have a nice scar . 
  do n't worry ladies , still works fine . 
  haha were you okay ? 
  would be an odd thing to lie about, 
  okay , you go design the study where half of the children get spanked and control for all other parenting variables . 
  until then , correlational studies are the best we have . 
  sorry to hear that . 
  it was n't until after . 
  the bleeding started again . 
  it was me and i deleted them all and addressed his points in the original post so others could see it . 
  the posts are all pretty close to 0 karma it was just an unproductive argument that i thought would be better served by a clear statement instead of a back and forth . 
  yes . 
  he can also lift it . 
  credit goes [ here ] ( http://thilinah.posterous.com/perception-of-science-in-popular-culture-vs-a ), 
  i 'd say no as a part of why men are so freaked out by the idea of touching another man is the stigma attached to it ( same reason you see more girls `` experimenting '' ) . 
  i have a gay friend who tried sleeping with a girl just to see what it 's like . 
  he told me that it was okay . 
  like he would n't seek it out but if the opportunity is there `` why not '' . 
  my car got written off ( broken beyond repair ) while it was parked in my driveway . 
  i was out , in someone else 's car , when i got a call from the cops telling me that some guy was hooning in my suburban street and lost control , veering off the road and hitting my car . 
  he hit it with such force that my car partially mounted the short brick wall it was next to . 
  luckily his car was fucked too so he coulnd ' t get away and had to pay for my new car . 
  sometimes i really care about the upvotes/downvotes i get . 
  normally i do n't but sometimes it really affects my mood . 
  in australia it 's not based on religion , it 's based on the fact that if you kick people out after a certain point in time they 've found that there are way less fights, 
  ahh , that 's fairly shit . 
  america often amuses me . 
  top desserts is sweeter . 
  yeh , half the time it 's hilarious to watch your politics , the other half of the time it 's deeply depressing . 
  we evolved from single-celled organisms . 
  do n't confuse someone not being able to conceptually understand something with it not being true . 
  they recently changed the law in my state to make it that you could n't enter an establishment after a certain time ( ca n't remember what sorry ) so it stops drunk people wandering from bar to bar ( having fights along the way ) . 
  yeh the enjoyment i get from karma depends on the context . 
  i get way more pleasure from a few upvotes on / r/askscience , / r/asksocialscience or / r/explainlikeimfive , teaching someone about psychology , than i do making a stupid joke in f7u12 . 
  have one back my good sir !, 
  have an upvote to support your drinking habit, 
  haha yeh , i do n't care about the accumulation , just the response to each individual post, 
  did you watch midget porn after that ? 
  upvote because i understand, 
  i do n't have an answer to the question but artificial selection is a thing . 
  this would still constitute natural selection though . 
  have one to get you a bit closer, 
  this was my great aunt but ... 
  when i had a chest infection and was coughing , she told me to go and smoke some weed to clear it up . 
  she 's 90 and clearly does n't wear a bra, 
  upvoted because i understand . 
  you 're not my real dad , you ca n't tell me what to do . 
  i realised afterwards . 
  it 's what 's commonly used in papers on it . 
  if you do n't get a good answer , you may want to try / r/asksocialscience, 
  i never watch it , the girl who hosts it annoys me . 
  do n't hold back pal, 
  upvoted because i understand, 
  sure . 
  it 's social acclaim . 
  why do you like it when people at a party think you 're interesting/funny ? 
  it 's the same thing just with a level of physical removal . 
  upvotes feel nice because it 's someone telling you that they find you valuable . 
  it does !, 
  volunteer in a lab/doing counselling . 
  get to know the staff at your college/university ( look up what research they do , it 's probably on the website ) . 
  teaching people about psychology, 
  while his morals were ahead of his time , they 'd be far , far behind our time . 
  we really do n't . 
  because we have an innate drive to continue our genetic line . 
  adoption does n't do that .
