  ** you are not qualified to handle that situation ** . 
  whatever it takes , get him to talk to a grief counsellor/psychologist/suicide prevention phone line attendant , whatever it takes . 
  perhaps not but it 's worth a shot . 
  this is much more / r/aww than / r/funny but upvoted because it 's simply awesome . 
  i think different parts of it would smell different . 
  for example , i think facebook would smell like lynx/axe deoderant , i think twitter would smell like a mcdonalds , reddit would smell like mold and i think 4chan would smell like santorum . 
  put my penis in her mouth . 
  never fails to work, 
  i have never tried to exploit money out of an april fools joke and was cleared on all cat-related charges . 
  thanks !, 
  / r/jokes, 
  have you considered an adult conversation about the topic ? 
  do you ever talk about his self-image ? 
  do you know if he wants to lose weight but does n't know how/if he can ? 
  was he that weight when you met ? 
  is he happy the way he is ? 
  do you make him feel guilty for being big ? 
  do you have the kind of relationship where you can simply tell him that you think he is n't happy at his weight and that you want to support/help him ? 
  the most important thing to remember is that if you ever make it sound like this is conditional , you will decrease the chance of him doing it ( and if he does it will be really bad for the relationship ) . 
  it may be a dealbreaker for you ( no judgement if it is ) but make every effort to make sure he does n't know that . 
  that completely depends on the context . 
  it 's a tough situation and there may be no perfect answer . 
  i think the suggestion of going on walks is a good one and just keep trying to probe to see whether * he * is happy with his weight . 
  it 's not at all uncommon for guys his size ( i used to be almost as big ) to try really hard to justify their inaction by convincing themselves that they 're happy . 
  at the end of the day though , the best thing you can do for him is make sure he feels loved and supported .

  please give credit to the [ artist ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guyjc ) and the original source . 
  the point is that it rewards people for consistently providing good content for others . 
  it 's a source of pride for some and why should n't you feel good that people appreciate your comment/submission ? 
  i may be in the minority but i think karma whoring is nowhere near as big an issue as other people . 
  if it 's a repost it will either get downvoted immediately or get upvoted because enough people have n't seen it ( if i have n't seen it , it 's new to me ) . 
  given the amount of content that goes through reddit , i do n't think it 's such a bad thing to have the odd repost . 
  i 'm on here a huge amount and i do n't see everything . 
  why are you here then ? 
  you did n't answer my question , you just slightly elaborated on your point . 
  if it 's so awful , why do you use it ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/otp5t/what_is_your_most_embarrassing_guilty_pleasure/c3jyfa5 ), 
  well ... 
  i have been masturbating more . 
  i did n't know you were on reddit . 
  it 's made my life better . 
  they do n't call it the second coming for nothing, 
  thanks but not need to be so formal , this is n't a letter . 
  i 'm guessing the guilty pleasures thread where i said i like upvotes, 
  thanks !, 
  well , like with any issue in a relationship . 
  you told her how you feel about it , she decides whether or not to do it . 
  if it 's a dealbreaker for you , that 's okay , but that 's your decision to make . 
  you do n't have the right to tell her what to do/not do with her body . 
  i would choose the ability to uncirclejerk popular subreddits . 
  first stop / r/politics, 
  yup , it 's called / r/circlejerk . 
  it 's really cool but robin 's face is kind of disturbing, 
  ron paul is the perfect candidate ... if you 're a college student who likes weed and has limited political knowledge . 
  convinced a friend to snort salt once . 
  he was scared so he did n't snort hard enough so a lot of it got stuck in his nose . 
  the pain he went through was incredible . 
  well , to some extent it does . 
  i only go to / r/politics for humour value . 
  if there was more legitimate discussion and fewer sensationalised titles that get to # 1 where the top reply is someone showing why it 's wrong , i would be active there . 
  the only problem is that way too many people it 's a haven of impartiality and immune to media bias ( kind of ironic considering that half of the top 10 are normally self-posts ) . 
  dat stool, 
  you accidentally a link, 
  be clear on what you want and stand up for yourself . 
  you do n't need to be an asshole to do that , just open and honest and who you are . 
  the `` nice guy does n't get the girl '' is true for the girls that ** you do n't want to be with ** and if you 're with someone who cares about you , they 'll understand that you have wants/needs too . 
  send her a text message ( it makes it less awkward for her if she 's not keen ) saying that you had a good time and you 're keen to see her again . 
  she may say no , she may say yes , there 's only one way to find out . 
  there 's is n't really a neurobiological consensus as to what causes it . 
  the difficulty with diagnosing mental health disorders is that they 're almost all symptoms that are normal within a certain range but only pathological outside of that range ( for example , a sad day is normal , two months in a row of sad days is a major depressive episode ) . 
  this is even more of a problem in adhd because attention has such a wide natural variation in the population . 
  for that reason , some researchers actually say that it is n't a real disorder since there is n't a clear neurobiological cause at this point . 
  what we do know , is that what we 're currently calling adhd is highly genetic . 
  this . 
  what the fuck . 
  i really hope you did n't shake hands, 
  not all ` evolutionary reasons ' are because it is adaptive . 
  sometimes , it 's an unintended consequence of something adaptive ( evolution is a very crude process ) . 
  pain is adaptive , it 's a very good clue that something is wrong/should be avoided . 
  wincing is because your brain produces too much of the stuff that gives you great information in small amounts . 
  good will hunting . 
  it will teach you that everyone has great excuses that stop themselves from really trying but they always leave you dissatisfied and wanting more out of your life . 
  more specifically the last 3 minutes of it . 
  i think what you 're referring to is reinforcement . 
  behaviours that are reinforced you 're more likely to do again , behaviours that are punished for you try to avoid . 
  there are three types of reinforcement :, 
  1 ) positive reinforcement : do something , have a nice feeling , want to do it again ( for example , eat delicious food ) . 
  2 ) negative reinforcement : do something , avoid negative feeling , want to do it again ( for example , walk away from a scary situation ) . 
  3 ) punishment : do something , have a negative experience , avoid it in the future ( touching a hot stove ) . 
  all of these are done neurochemically . 
  while reinforcement is an accurate depiction , it 's too simplistic and does n't factor in cognition enough . 
  however , it 's still a really interesting way to break down behaviour . 
  go on ... 
  asking redditors to talk about and show pictures of their pets ? 
  this has front page written all over it . 
  it 's a fairly biased piece but it gives the case for adhd not being a real disorder . 
  also , feel free to ask nicely next time . 
  you accidentally a question, 
  stay indoors, 
  sorry , what do you mean by prepper/survivalist ?
