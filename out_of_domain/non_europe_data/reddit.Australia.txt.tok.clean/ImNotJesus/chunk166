  you can talk about it in the context of where you 've come from . 
  my so knows that i used to suffer from depression and it 's helpful because it helps her to understand me better . 
  you do n't have to and he might not handle it well ( hard to knwo without knowing him ) but you have ** absolutely nothing ** to be ashamed of and it may be fruitful . 
  no they do n't . 
  there 's a big difference between being happy and being on a manic phase,

  i agree . 
  you 've made your position clear , if that has changed for him and he needs something different , it may be a dealbreaker for him . 
  that might not be fair , but you need to be ready for that reality . 
  it 's also a good chance to try and work out how you do feel about it , is there a chance you * are * scared ? 
  have you told him that ? 
  have you told him you just need more time ? 
  the big turning point is ( generally ) 35 . 
  you do n't need to decide tomorrow . 
  talk to your husband . 
  tell him what your * specific * concerns are and try to come up with a plan/timeline . 
  it 's a trap . 
  even if it 's not a trap , it 's almost certainly going to change things between you . 
  i 'd go outside . 
  it 's bright but i think i could get used to it in time . 
  have you seen a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist ? 
  you need on-going care , not medication . 
  if your anxiety levels are this severe , once a month is n't enough . 
  have you talked to your therapist about relaxation techniques ? 
  what sort of therapy is it ? 
  a bunch of different types . 
  do you mainly talk about your history or do you talk more about your thought patterns ? 
  honestly , if anxiety is that big a concern you should be seeing her ( or someone else ) more .

  if it 's negatively impacting on your life , there 's something you can do . 
  you should do it under the supervision of a psychologist and it 's called systematic desensitisation . 
  basically what you do is go through stages where you stress yourself more and more ( first you just think about it , then you look at a picture of one etc. ), 
  and each time use a relaxation technique to calm yourself down until you get comfortable with that stage . 
  it 's very effective and can be done quite quickly . 
  ps : you should n't hate yourself for how you react , lots of people have phobias and they 're by nature irrational .

  ** some people ** on reddit post about how stupid 9gag is ... 
  i do n't really care where the content comes from . 
  also , 9gag can be terrible and still have some good stuff . 
  the point is , who cares ? 
  the idea of the process is that you only get as anxious as you can handle . 
  if you get * too * anxious , it defeats the purpose . 
  that 's why i said you should do it under supervision because they 'll be able to monitor you and guide you through the relaxation phase . 
  best of luck !, 
  unless you jump out of shock and the needle rips out of your arm ( happened to me ) . 
  yes . 
  unless he 's in imminent danger it 's really unfair . 
  he trusted you with the information , do n't ruin that . 
  you can encourage him to do so but that 's as far as you 're allowed to go . 
  alright , best of luck !, 
  it comes down to danger . 
  if his life is genuinely in danger and he 's not telling them for an irrational reason , you can do it but expect him to be unhappy . 
  it 's not an easy situation and i 'm sorry for that . 
  america glorifies everything . 
  that depends on whether i 'm watching family guy or pbs frontline .

  that does n't sound creepy . 
  if you started singing `` i will die for you '' it would probably come off as a bit intense but it sounds like she 'll love it . 
  do you have any idea of the magnitude of the lawsuits against them if they fixed the cards ? 
  also , they do n't care who wins , they get money from people * playing * not from anyone in particular winning . 
  if you ever think it 's * justified * , you 're much better off not being in the relationship . 
  it 's based on psychoanalytics , an early branch of pscyhology developed by freud that is largely outdated . 
  the oedipus complex basically states that during the last stage of childhood development , the boy tries to conquer his father by winning the affections of his mother . 
  freud claimed that all men have internal desire to sleep with their mother and not developing properly during the last stage of development will lead to neurosis and pathology . 
  it 's interesting but unfounded scientifically . 
  it 's great that you 've found who you want to be in the relationship , now you just need to find a man that shares that vision . 
  ** there 's nothing wrong with wanting to be a housewife ** and it does n't mean you need to be subserviant . 
  you know , recent studies have actually shown that egalitarian households tend to be less happy than those with clear gender roles . 
  i think that 'll change over the next few generations ( as people learn to have egalitarian relationships better ) but there 's no reason you ca n't have clear roles as long as both of you are happy with them . 
  does n't make cheating okay . 
  two-pronged approach :, 
  1 ) realise that he looking at an attractive woman is like looking at art . 
  he 's appreciating and enjoying it but that does n't mean he wants that more than you . 
  if you expect to be the only attractive girl in the world , you 're in trouble . 
  trust him that regardless of whether he looks or not , he still comes home to you . 
  2 ) talk to him : tell him it upsets you ( in a calm manner ) and why it hurts your feelings . 
  give him the chance to explain why he does it and maybe tell him that you do n't expect him to never look at a girl again but he can do it in a way that considers your feelings better . 
  upvoting a comment on their user page does n't affect karma . 
  what about it makes you cranky ? 
  do you think it means that he finds them more attractive than you ? 
  do you worry he 'll stray ?
