  because the whole world is built around a massive misogynistic conspiracy to keep you down, 
  that 's understandable and there 's a happy medium where you can help him be mindful of your feelings without completely controlling him . 
  open communication is the way to find it . 
  hey micheal , the first and most important question is : do your parents have the means to send you to a psychologist ? 
  if yes , you need to be really brave and tell them how you 're feeling and that you need help . 
  if not , try to find out if the school has a counselling service . 
  beyond that , there 's some good stuff you can do to temporarily help yourself . 
  have you tried meditation ? 
  it 's had amazing clinical results recently ( go to itunes and search for ucla mindfulness ) . 
  the other thing you can do is try to exercise more . 
  go on some walks by yourself with/without some music and get some fresh air/exercise , i promise you 'll feel better . 
  the most important thing to remember is that depression is a temporary state where things feel worse than they are . 
  it 's real and you have no reason to be ashamed of those feelings , just remember that they will pass in time . 
  if you need any more info about anything i 've said or want some advice about picking a pscyhologist/other methods just let me know ( in pm if you prefer ) . 
  the same reason you dismiss people 's disagreements as negativity . 
  meditate . 
  the studies being done on mindfulness meditation at the moment suggest that it has wonderful long-term and short-term effects on all sorts of pscyhological factors . 
  there are some great guided meditations on itunes that were put up by ucla 's mindfulness research centre . 
  they 're really good . 
  the main thing is you just need to be non-judgemental and ease your attention back to your focal point ( be it breath , body etc. ), 
  depression does n't need to have a cause . 
  i do n't want you to see a psychiatrist , i want you to see a ** psychologist ** . 
  you need someone to talk to about * why * you 're depressed . 
  that 's much more gratifying than all the tags about me not being jesus or refer to my junk, 
  god i fucking hate exaggeration with every fibre of my being too . 
  1 ) whether or not he 's touching them , it 's a form of cheating if he 's lying to you about it . 
  2 ) why do n't you go with him if you 're that keen to find out who it is ? 
  3 ) your husband sounds like he 's full of shit, 
  the point of a conversation is n't to win . 
  talk to her ** about herself ** . 
  find out who she is as a person , what she likes/dislikes , what she wants for the future etc. 
  do n't go in with the intention of impressing her with your intellect , you 'll just end up sounding like a dick , i guarantee it . 
  i get that . 
  what you do instead though , is keep asking questions . 
  instead of arguing that x , y or z is wrong , ask her why she wants/feels that . 
  sometimes challenging people 's beliefs is n't actually the best way to learn about them , especially when you have n't known them for very long . 
  practice . 
  sign up to a dating website and go on a bunch of dates . 
  sit there and ask them question after question . 
  learn to feel comfortable and learn to appreciate that you ca n't control everything . 
  not, 
  involved, 
  yes . 
  that was an easy one, 
  yes it does . 
  there are many different types of economics and they all have different answers . 
  you might want to try / r/asksocialscience since you 'll get a better answer than the basic level i can answer this at . 
  because it 's all a media conspiracy to stop ron paul getting into power because they do n't want marijuana to be legalised . 
  well it can be compared in the sense that they 're both addictions but drug abuse has unique effects on the brain that is n't seen in non-substance addictions . 
  i would also suggest that recovery rates are much higher in internet addicts due to not having a substance dependence . 
  not a chance in hell . 
  solitary confinement is psychological torture and you 're almost certain to have long-term effects as a result . 
  i was going to ask for reddit gold too but this is a much better idea . 
  donate it online to doctors without borders or something . 
  by cuckolding your busty wife obviously, 
  conversely , you could act like an adult and ignore her . 
  just saying . 
  about to finish work ( it 's 11pm in australia ) and then i 'm keen for some sleep . 
  not interested in your wife though , sorry . 
  the gays ruining marriage for the normals, 
  that does n't mean the same thing outside of england, 
  if you 're interested in the topic , the psychologist paul bloom has a brilliant book on this called how pleasure works : the new science of why we like what we like, 
  relevant username ? 
  peter griffin, 
  letting her have sex with me, 
  ## so brave, 
  the victim 's family are n't properly trained, 
  the point of the criminal justice system is n't supposed to be about revenge . 
  giving the choice to the victim 's family flies in the face of that . 
  the victim 's family are ** clearly ** too emotionally involved to be objective, 
  it puts them in an unfair position that no-one should be in , let alone people that have just gone through a trauma, 
  do you want more reasons ? 
  i think the polite thing to do is cuddle after sex but i often get told that it costs extra, 
  clearly you have n't done a good enough job of finding deductions and if you have you 've been undertaxed all year so you should be glad you 're not paying any back . 
  yeh , i 'm the same . 
  sometimes i have to stop myself because i notice myself getting too into making faces at a baby . 
  90 % of the time the mother things it 's great , especially if i 'm somewhere with my so ( fair or not , if you 're out with a girl , you can get away with a lot more because there 's a presumption you 're normal ) . 
  babies make me happy . 
  i make babies happy . 
  it works . 
  `` look , ma'am , there 's no reason to get upset , i 'm just trying to be polite by handing you the toilet paper . 
  if you did n't want me to , you should n't have started while i was in the vent . '', 
  the same place i hide every night . 
  in front of my computer, 
  started chewing the gum that had been in her mouth for a while . 
  not sure what i was trying to prove and it , surprisingly , did n't work, 
  actually , i pay them to dress me up in a nappy and spank me, 
  we get some brilliant discussions but there are n't enough questions !, 
  only if you 're emotionally prepared for the worst-case scenario, 
  you 're fucking sick . 
  why would you spend so much time imagining me masturbating ? 
  you ca n't really compare the mind-altering of cigarettes to weed though . 
  not saying you should n't do it , i 'm saying mentally prepare yourself for the worst, 
  i plan to !, 
  need to finish studying first, 
  haha . 
  when i 'm at work i send my so pictures of babies dressed up in little outfits to entertain her . 
  we both love kids . 
  yes . 
  in many different fields .
