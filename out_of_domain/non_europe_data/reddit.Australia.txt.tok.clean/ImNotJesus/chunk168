  well ... do you ? 
  this is n't a suitable / r/askreddit question and should be removed by the mods . 
   askreddit is for thought-provoking , inspired questions . 
  there 's plenty of literature on penis size averages that you can read .

  a friend of mine was asking for something from one of the trainers at the gym and the guy said no and that my friend 's request was unreasonable . 
  so , i turned to my friend and jokingly said `` yeah , you cunt '' . 
  well the roid-raging trainer thought i was talking to him and did not take kindly to it . 
  luckily we were able to calm him down before he rolled into a ball and threw me down the stairs . 
  obligatory 1-up, 
  you 're an idiot, 
  yeh ... 
  i 'm pretty sure you do n't know what the word irony means . 
  what the fuck did i just read ? 
  why did n't you just say `` a little less tight please '' . 
  she wanted you to enjoy it , do n't suffer in silence you dingus . 
  she 's never played with one before and does n't know what it feels like , she just did n't know . 
  with a side of fetus fries ? 
  that was bad and you should feel bad, 
  you know the rules and so do i, 
  psychology is a science . 
  some people do n't approach it scientifically but that can be said for any field . 
  i do n't really know how you can say that . 
  there are many people who still maintain that psychoanalytics holds unprovable truths and reject the findings of other subfields . 
  i think they 're wrong and so does the ** vast ** majority of the psychological community but of course they exist . 
  clinical psych is based on research psych ... 
  and what do you call the myriad of studies showing that therapy works ? 
  wishful thinking ? 
  of course there have been mistakes but it 's not all freuds anymore . 
  of course you can but then what you produce is n't valid science . 
  there are millions of examples of scientists doing that . 
  i have to use internet explorer 6 at work . 
  if you do it , make sure to film it and at least get some reddit karma in return, 
  meditate . 
  i know it 's not unique but the studies suggest that it really works . 
  you can use it to alleviate current stress or you can do it when calm to increase your ability to deal with stress in the future . 
  just play it cool . 
  pretend you 're going out with a friend ( except offer to pay ) . 
  make lots of conversation - when in doubt , ask her about herself . 
  do n't try to kiss her unless you have a ** very ** strong indication and do n't ask to see her again until the next day . 
  most of all , relax and enjoy yourself . 
  at least now i understand why everyone always talks about the drop, 
  all good , if it has this much attention clearly enough people have n't seen it to be interesting . 
  prepare to have angry nerds yell at you though . 
  one does not simply pick the worst meme . 
  actually , wait , i just did . 
  i agree . 
  their obesity episode was pretty shameful but love the rest, 
  well , you see , some crazy people made some shit up and that 's how we get stupid conspiracy theories . 
  i 'm generally very tender when i make love to your mother but i believe i 'm in the minority there,

  oh shit , i do n't remember that . 
  which ep ? 
  and each will only take you so far . 
  not sure but apparently i 've given you 3 upvotes . 
  well played , well played . 
  i 'd give you my comeback but you 'll have to scrape it off your mother 's teeth, 
  do n't ever mistake / r/politics for the popular opinion . 
  it 's kind of like thinking the top post on / r/atheism represents all atheists . 
  this question . 
  fuck you op . 
  fuck you, 
  short article but very exciting news !, 
  alien blue,

  you wash ? 
  do you live by yourself ? 
  do you have a boyfriend ? 
  i think dick is a cock, 
  because once a thread reaches 200 + posts , the new stuff almost never gets seen enough to rise to the top . 
  ignore the trolls , they 'll get bored soon enough, 
  hey , clean your shit up , we 're sharing this space, 
   down vote me i do n't care, 
  done !, 
  ohh . . oh baby that felt good . 
  do n't worry , i 'm not downvoting anyone else . 
  i upvoted that post . 
  studies show that having more money does n't correlate with more happiness if you 've had the money for about 6 months or more . 
  this is because people are very good at acclimatising to their new situation . 
  the same was actually found for people who lost a limb . 
  they were very upset for a while but by the 6 month mark , their happiness returned to normal . 
  if you want to use money to buy happiness , studies show a couple of tips :, 
  1 ) money spent on other people is enjoyed more than money spent on yourself . 
  2 ) money spent on experiences is enjoyed more than money spent on items ( memories tend to be embellished over time but items tend to become less enjoyed with time ), 
  okay , do you mind if i look through all of your draws ? 
  whether or not it 's legal , get the fuck out of there . 
  that rule is fucked . 
  be glad you did n't kill someone . 
  really bad question, 
  better than a 10 year old at a papal convention, 
  it does n't . 
  admins never remove mods ( beyond really bad things ) so if you guys do n't like it , and there is n't a higher ranked mod , you have to make a new community . 
  so why do n't you mail him ? 
  he 's probably not on at the moment, 
  love at first sight is a fairytale . 
  if you `` love '' someone at first sight , that 's just lust . 
  love is complicated and deeper than that . 
  i 'd be offended if my so said she fell in love with me at first sight .
