  what else does he do ? 
  almost certainly, 
  actually , the evidence suggests that ginseng does n't actually work either . 
  read [ this ] ( http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/acupuncture-and-modern-bloodletting/ ), 
  get thrown off the bus less, 
  ca n't get you a reference because i 'm at work but i 'm fairly sure that incidences of homosexuality were more common in monozygotic twins indicating a genetic component . 
  the reason we use scientific studies is that our perception of things like that are very flawed . 
  * cshhhhhhh *, 
  he 's on to us . 
  pull out , pull out, 
  * cshhhhhhh *, 
  you can believe whatever you want . 
  those beliefs are normally considered to not be consistent with the bible and that 's why a lot of christians do n't ` believe ' in evolution or the big bang . 
  / r/spacedicks and anything, 
  clearly you 've never met a fundamentalist christian before . 
  plenty of christians believe that . 
  was literally typing those words, 
  you seem to be confusing your ability to understand something with it being true, 
  do n't have a source on me but i remember reading some papers that said atheists have , on average , higher average incomes than religious people in america . 
  another interesting fact : the name big bang was actually given to make fun of the theory because it was considered silly at the time but the name stuck . 
  not saying that there are n't plenty of christians of who do ` believe ' in evolution and the big bang ( although the numbers in america are fairly depressing ) , just saying it 's not consistent with a literal interpretation of the bible . 
  and they would say you 're not an `` actual christian '' in return . 
  jeff buckley - grace, 
  * whooooooosh *, 
  depends on the fine print . 
  my ipod is full of audiobooks and podcasts . 
  either days or i die instantly . 
  to add to this ; jonathan haidt talks about the variations in morality between cultures . 
  he identified [ 5 moral foundations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonathan_haidt#moral_foundations_theory ) ; care , fairness , loyalty , respect and purity and argued that different cultures varied based on their differing levels of focus on these factors ( he also did a ted talk about the difference between republicans and democrats based on this model ) . 
  i would suggest that judeo-christian cultures , and most religiously based cultures , had a much higher importance placed on a sense of purity than the romans . 
  you seem to be making the very wrong assumption that any psychics exist . 
  if you do n't get a good answer you might want to try / r/asksocialscience, 
  three factors :, 
  1 ) less novelty in having sex with each other, 
  2 ) people tend to be less sexually driven as they get older, 
  3 ) you 're a fuckload busier ( kids/careers etc. ), 
  sorry , i agree with your point but, 
   it 's pareihdolia perpetuated by proprioception . 
  makes 0 sense in that context, 
  paraedolia = seeing faces in ambiguous objects, 
  proprioception = your brain 's sense of your body and its movement,

  what are the parameters of the paper ? 
  what 's the class ( is it an intro class or a specific type of psychology ) ? 
  personally , i 'd focus my paper on ingroup-outgroup behaviour . 
  like i 'd talk about how being able to kill is a social norm within the ingroup so it has to become a personal norm, 
  actually there 's some really fascinating stuff going on with psych in the military at the moment . 
  have you heard of positive psychology ? 
  the founder of it , martin seligman , was basically tasked with understanding why suicide rates are so high in the military and if there 's a way to predict it . 
  his findings have been incredibly fascinating . 
  i 've heard him do some talks on it so just search for seligman on itunes as a starting point, 
  the 1800s called ... 
  these google people , do they do nice arrangements ? 
  i think you 're referring to [ mass hysteria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_hysteria ), 
  what did the dentist and/or doctor say ? 
  i 'm quite opinionated, 
  well he wrote this [ book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/happiness-hypothesis-finding-modern-ancient/dp/0465028012 ) about positive psychology . 
  he made this [ ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html ) on the difference between conservatives and liberals . 
  [ this ] ( http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/mft/index.php ) is his website that explains the moral foundations theory better, 
  [ here ] ( http://cbdr.cmu.edu/seminar/haidt.pdf ) and [ here ] ( http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/readings/haidtsciencearticle.pdf ) is a bit more of his writing . 
  there are also some [ clips ] ( http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=haidt&amp;speakers=jonathan+haidt ) of him on tsn including a really interesting panel with him , sam harris and some others ( i mention sam because a lot of it was focussed on his book ) . 
  no chance of me finding top comment but here 's my top [ submission ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b07h1.jpg ), 
  no problems at all . 
  that 's why i 'm here . 
  because then they 'd be toeprints dingus, 
  take the paperwork to your manager and explain what has happened . 
  if he gives you a satisfactory response , move on . 
  if he does n't , contact a lawyer . 
  stop smoking weed ( at least until you get the attacks under control ) and go speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  this is a serious medical condition and you should treat it as such . 
  you 'll probably get a good answer on / r/asksocialscience, 
  nerves are there to give you information . 
  your brain is telling you that you 're anxious . 
  in some situations it 's helpful and in others it 's not . 
  just remember that we did n't evolve anxiety in a situation where supermarkets are common . 
  lots of foreplay, 
  try to relax, 
  you 're going to be terrible , get over it already . 
  have a glass of wine or * a * beer but do n't get hammered, 
  joke about it , try to feel comfortable with each other . 
  go slow , if it 's her first time it will hurt . 
  use lube . 
  use protection, 
  have fun . 
  psychiatrists cost a lot more money and are n't as well trained in therapy . 
  your first stop for this sort of thing should be a psychologist . 
  if you ca n't get enough control , see a psychiatrist with a letter from your psychologist and use medication as a supplement . 
  medication should n't be the first answer unless it 's a very severe condition . 
  also , there are different kinds of therapy that a psychologist can use for anxiety . 
  why would we talk about religion ? 
  he asked a scientific question . 
  i 'm confused by your ranking system unless you 're saying this is the 50th best or 50th worst post . 
  i think you mean rates . 
  my mum tried asking how to spell someone 's name when she could n't remember it . 
  b-o-b he replied . 
  it 's probably mulva, 
  i drink up to 4-5 large energy drinks a day and i do n't think it 's very good for my heart/brain/stomach . 
  this seems like solid advice, 
  you 're about to go on a date with a guy and you ` accidentally ' hear him calling his mum to tell her how great you are . . 
  run,
