  go speak to a counsellor, 
  most days i am at some point . 
  there are parts of my life that are really hard and stresses i wish i did n't have but my life is where i want it to be right now . 
  it took a lot of hard work , soul searching ( aided by psychotherapy ) and a bit of luck but i 'm glad i 'm here . 
  i definitely think i enjoy where i 'm at more because i came from a place where i thought it would never happen . 
  it 's what they 're trained to do and is no different to telling your doctor about feeling unwell . 
  what you 're going through is very much normal and you have no reason to feel ashamed or uncomfortable . 
  if that 's the only barrier for you , do you mind telling me why you 'd feel uncomfortable ? 
  either arrested development or firefly, 
  you `` hate '' ugly people ? 
  you sound like a winner . 
  if this has been going on for several months you 're ** crazy ** to not seek further professional help . 
  this is horrible for your health and i guarantee it 's making college much , much more difficult . 
  if you 're not happy with the response your physician gave , speak to another one . 
  go back to him or go see the campus consellor . 
  do whatever you have to do , this is really , really bad for you . 
  kept backfiring and cost me more money than she was worth, 
  he was joking ( i hope ) . 
  the irony ... is ... just ... too ... much, 
  proven *, 
  talk to her , you dingus . 
  what what in the butt, 
  how boring are you to fuck that she 's talking about random biology trivia ? 
  22 all year round, 
  you add more milk to your tea, 
  vitamins do almost nothing to your health if you have a balanced diet and no medical conditions that require vitamins . 
  in fact , studies have shown that taking vitamins makes you more likely to make bad health choices - it 's called the licencing effect . 
  go to a doctor, 
  i found my sister outside sitting outside with her friends . 
  she told me she was making a bong to smoke cigarettes with but i should n't tell my parents . 
  a few months later , after me and my sister arguing about who had more dirt on the other , i informed my dad that my sister had been making a bomb . 
  none of us can possibly know , go talk to a psychologist . 
  back to the future style hoverboards, 
  someone 's image/character is part of what they 're selling . 
  you do n't think there are a bunch of actors that would n't be getting the work they are if they were uglier ? 
  have you tried / r/philosophy ? 
  there already is one . 
  read the faqs, 
  amputate a limb . 
  works 60 % of the time , every time . 
  might want to try / r/standupcomedy a lot of young stand ups on there, 
  what do you want me to say ? 
  you do n't like her , other people do . 
  suck it up princess, 
  do n't freak out . 
  you want to be his ally , not someone he fears is watching him all the time . 
  talk to him about it , tell him why it worries you and ask him if there 's any questions he wants to ask * you * . 
  tell him that he should ask you before trying anything else because some things can be very dangerous . 
  take several photos and leave a note . 
  if they do n't respond to your note go to the cops .

  i think any rational adult will agree that ` the one ' is a fairytale ( listn to tim minchin 's song `` if i did n't have you '' ) . 
  however , that does n't mean compatibility is inconsequential . 
  there are all sorts of factors ( many of which are unconscious , psychological factors ) go into whether a couple ` works ' . 
  i love my so and am incredibly glad that i 'm with her . 
  does that mean i would n't have found someone else that makes me close to , or as happy if i never met her ? 
  of course not . 
  the reason love becomes an exaggeration is that it builds and grows . 
  the closer we become , the more we share . 
  the more we share , the closer we become . 
  this is all very new territory for both fo you so be patient . 
  here are your options :, 
  1 ) explain to her again that you have needs that are not being met . 
  you only love and want to touch her and what you 're doing is about fantasy . 
  2 ) do it in secrecy, 
  3 ) leave her if you 're not sexually fulfilled and this is a deal-breaker for you, 
  all three are valid and no-one can tell you which to do . 
  that 's the only answer . 
  you need to be honest and tell them that you 've made mistakes but you 're turning your life around and reconnecting with them is important to you . 
  be prepared to not always be happy with the response though . 
  according to qi the only known cure is digital-anal stimulation . 
  sounds like a sad way to go through life . 
  people do it though . 
  automatic upvote - making me laugh, 
  automatic downvote - getting a science fact ( especially a psychological one ) wrong . 
  assume that you 're an absolute moron, 
  no-one thinks abortion is ** good ** . 
  that 's why they call it pro-choice not pro-abortion . 
  also , you seem to think that it 's something people do flippantly . 
  it 's an incredibly difficult and upsetting thing to do and for those it is n't , i 'm incredibly glad they 're not having kids because they lack the emotional maturity to do so . 
  why the fuck should someone commit to taking care of a child because you think it degrades societies values ? 
  why the fuck should a baby have to be born into a family that is n't ready ( financially or emotionally ) for it ? 
  my point is that no-one is saying it 's a good option . 
  no sane or mature woman would ever , ever , ever , ever want to have one . 
  of course parents of kids who get pregnant could have done things differently but you know what ? 
  they 're kids and they 're going to make mistakes . 
  get the fuck over it . 
  as an australia , i approve of this laughter . 
  `` nothing in this world worth having comes easy '' - dr bob kelso, 
  just an fyi , in psychology that 's called dissociation . 
  if it 's severe/common it can be a dissociative disorder . 
  yeh it sounds like it 's more of a thought experiment for you but i never miss an opportunity to teach some psychology , 
  also , they 're strategies that are good at getting you laid , not getting someone to like you . 
  if you want to start a relationship with someone they 're terrible . 
  it 's actually a category of disorders ( it 's the equivalent of saying a ` mood disorder ' ) . 
  some of the most bizarre disorders come under that category though . 
  read up on dissociative fugue . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  do n't take no for an answer . 
  take her to a doctor .
