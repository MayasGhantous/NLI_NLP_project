  making jokes that fall flat on reddit, 
  there 's a type of subliminal messaging that 's regularly used in psychological experiments . 
  it 's called priming . 
  basically , as our brains work in networks of interrelated nodes ( neurons that fire together , wire together ) thinking about one item makes you more likely to think of an item that is often thought of together . 
  for example , one of the seminal studies on priming had two sets of participants unjumble words in a list . 
  half of the participants had unrelated words and the others had words that related to being old . 
  after the experiment , the participants were timed to see how long it took them to walk down the hallway . 
  the participants who had unjumbled the words about being old walked significantly slower . 
  he needs mental health care . 
  if the psychiatrist could n't help him , he needs to see a new one . 
  it 's impossible to know without knowing him but it could be any number of severe disorders causing this . 
  do you suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day ? 
  sounds like you might have narcolepsy . 
  ever wake up and ca n't move ? 
  get a second opinion, 
  not everyone gets the sleep paralysis . 
  i would n't freak out or anything but might be worth talking to a sleep specialist . 
  if you 're consistently not getting good quality sleep a sleep study could give you the answer . 
  no problems at all . 
  best of luck, 
  i was a 9 ' 5 baby . 
  my mother had to have several plastic surgeries . 
  and depressing/unfulfilling, 
  maxwellhill because / r/politics loves posts from courthousenews . 
  some guy 's defense attorney said that the police did n't do a legal search . 
  where are our pitchforks ? 
  what i did was dirtbaggish but what i got back in return was way worse :, 
  a girl i was about to kiss told me that she would n't kiss me unless we were going to go out ( i was 15 and never kissed a girl ) and i said sure , let 's be a couple . 
  we made out for a while and went out separate ways . 
  half way home i realised what a terrible mistake i made and apologised , saying i wanted to stay friends . 
  a week later she starts sending me pictures of her wrists that she 'd been cutting and telling me she would n't stop until we were together . 
  after this went on for a couple of weeks , i finally made her go see the school counsellor . 
  i did n't hear anything from her for a little bit until i got a note from the counsellor saying he wanted to see both of us at the same time . 
  i genuinely wanted to help her so i went . 
  i sat down with the two of them and she refused to talk . 
  he then got annoyed at her for not talking and told me that he was going to leave the two of us to talk ( seriously , worst counsellor ever . 
  i also saw him yell at a primary school kid once ) . 
  over the next ** 2 hours ** she begged me to take her back and tried to grope me , saying that she 'd `` do anything '' . 
  the counsellor did n't return . 
  eventually i left and she changed schools shortly after . 
  if you have deeper feelings , do n't do it . 
  it will not end well . 
  tell her you want more . 
  if that 's the case you do n't want to be with her , it 's a horribly immature outlook . 
  look , if you go for less , it 's understandable but you 'll end up getting hurt . 
  tell her you want more than that and tell her why ( without being too creepy ) and see what happens . 
  worst case scenario you miss out on some meaningless sex , best case scenario you get what you actually want . 
  why would n't we protect people creating new content ? 
  people think i give really good advice and listen well . 
  not sure what i do but people have always opened up to me . 
  i 'm sure that 's partly why i 'm studying to become a psychologist . 
  i have had sex several times with attractive women from calling the numbers . 
  try it . 
  i wish you would of cleared this up earlier for me . 
  would of saved me making this mistake a bunch of times, 
  impossible to tell you without knowing you better . 
  you could be wanting her for all sorts of reasons ( many of which are self-destructive ) . 
  if you want to know , go talk to a psychologist . 
  i think that anti-vaccers are n't just negligent morons who should have their children taken away from them , they 're also potentially killing immuno-compromised people who ca n't get vaccinated ( you know , like kids with leukemia ) . 
  you seem to be confusing you not knowing enough about it with the answers/studies not being there . 
  there 's an incredible amount of evidence into the efficacy of of vaccines . 
  wakefield 's autism studies were n't just retracted , they lost him his licence and were clearly falsified . 
  there 's no evidence they cause any significant damage but there 's loads of evidence that not having them does cause damage . 
  jeff buckley, 
  depends on a lot of factors ( how long you 've been together , why you broke up , if you 're still friends etc. ), 
  no hard and fast rule imo, 
  i still use `` so 's your face '' to great effect, 
  whether or not it 's normal , it does n't sound like a very happy way to live your life . 
  have you considered talking to a psych ** ologist ** ? 
  it sounds like you 're pretty angry , pal . 
   know exactly how you feel and beleve it is becuse the genreal poplation isnt as intellegent as us, 
   people are sheap, 
  provide funny and/or interesting content + a bit of luck, 
  jackpot . 
  i would n't have been born if not for hitler . 
  plus , he killed hitler so he was n't all bad, 
  punched my locker and broke my hand, 
  you mean angry , arrogant people on the internet ? 
  what a sad way to miss out on learning opportunities and positive experiences in life . 
  i find it odd that he 's so freaked out about hitting the front page but it 's on a throwaway . 
  `` for the love of god do not let this get to the front page . '', 
  is a pretty sure-fire way to get upvoted . 
  i know there 's no karma ( nor would i care if he stole precious imaginary points ) but my bullshit detector is going off . 
  the idea is that anyone who knows enough about medicine to give good advice is also smart enough to know that it 's a very stupid idea to diagnose someone over the internet . 
  therefore , the only people who suggest things tend to not know what they 're talking about ( there are exceptions , obviously ) . 
  [ i do n't know what i expected ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_i2uqkgxiykm/tmuiwalqb4i/aaaaaaaanxq/fv4tfwzetsq/s1600/dove+apandas.png ), 
  you mean a picture of his wormhole ? 
  i can make any woman disappear , just by talking to her . 
  my elbow hurts just from trying to imagine that . 
  what a weird coincidence , i actually donated just today . 
  the entire process took about 1.5 hours ( it took longer because it was my first time ) and was almost entirely painless . 
  afterwards , they gave me a milkshake and some sausage rolls !, 
  according the the nurse that took my blood , the average donation saves 3 lives . 
  i just gave red blood cells since it 's my first time but i 'll give plasma in the future . 
  i also signed up to be a bone marrow donor at the same time but you obviously do n't need to do that . 
  i 'm doing it again as soon as i can . 
  note : i 'm from australia , it may be different where you 're from . 
  does it count if i donated for the first time today but it was n't as a result of the drive ? 
  edit : #donated, 
  drinking a glass of cooking oil,
