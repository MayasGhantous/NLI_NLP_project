  having kids fixes most relationship issues, 
  i think that the stupidity of it is only surpassed by the apparenty upset it causes to many redditors, 
  drink water the night before, 
  i would do very little for a dollar . 
  i 'm no longer 6, 
  your mother . 
  she told me she 'd be gone by the time i woke up, 
  find ways to gain satisfaction in your life that are n't built around other people finding you attractive . 
  you know if you 'd put that in an account it 'd be worth significantly more now right ? 
  it would be highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist to give you advice in this forum . 
  if you need some basic advice about what sort of therapy to seek out i can help you but treatment over the net is n't really possible . 
  $ 784 based on a 4.5 % interest rate ( pretty easy to get in australia , not sure about where you 're from ) . 
  getting more than 50 % extra seems worth it . 
  oh thank god . 
  i 've got worms in my anus . 
  what to do ? 
  stds, 
  this guy 's legit everybody, 
  you 're not going to treat a mental health issue because you ca n't do it on reddit ? 
  what 's actually wrong ? 
  why do you think you need care ? 
  why do n't you want to see a psychologist/psychiatrist in person ? 
  nah i do n't actually have hiv . 
  i need it badly to get bingo though, 
  is there a school/college counsellor you can see ? 
  why are they anti-therapy ? 
  maybe i can help you talk to them about it, 
  it 's completely normal, 
  if you 're experimenting with your sexuality, 
  what condition do you need treatment for ? 
  bengay on my balls, 
  i do , it 's called science . 
  no sacred text of any of the major religions hold up to scientific scrutiny . 
  yes , i do tell people that ( if we 're talking about religion ) . 
  okay , there are a couple of things you can do without therapy but i really recommend you either talk to your parents , get enough work to pay for it or go back to the counellors . 
  1 ) there are books that teach you how to use cbt ( cognitive behavioural therapy ) on yourself . 
  some of them are crap but there are ones written by professionals that do actually work . 
  2 ) make sure you 're getting enough sleep , regular meals and exercising - even if it 's just walking around the block . 
  3 ) start meditating . 
  search on itunes for `` ucla mindfulness '' and spend a few minutes a day practising . 
  studies are showing incredible effectiveness for reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms . 
  these are stop-gap solutions and will reduce your symptoms but are unlikely to fix the issue . 
  find a way to speak to a therapist . 
  some people have !, 
  also , thanks . 
  being australian . 
  if you 're saying ` unique ' and not incredibly painful , you did n't have as much on there as me . 
  haha i climbed up on the bathroom bench and put my junk under the tap while smothering it with soap . 
  yeh , sometimes i feel like i have a little bit of cancer . 
  you can have hypomanic bipolar . 
  that 's not what op has . 
  op is just going through the normal flow of mood . 
  name her notjesus, 
  you ca n't be in love with someone you 've never talked to . 
  you 're lusting after her . 
  if you think that 's love , you know nothing of love . 
  if you 're thinking about death , you need to go speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  if you 're depressed , it 's the same answer . 
  because seeing a psychologist should always go before a psychiatrist unless it 's a very severe mental disorder . 
  psychologists are much better trained in therapy and can always refer you to a psychiatrist if medication is required as a supplement to therapy .

  the problem is n't just evolution , it 's abiogenesis ( life starting ) . 
  it 's very possible ( some consider it mathematically likely ) that there are other life forms on other planets that evolved in different conditions to our own planet . 
  however , just because it 's possible , does n't mean that it 's likely . 
  at the moment , we only have a sample size of one though . 
  knock knock,

  not sure if you 're joking or trolling but the e stands for elevation .

  `` life is like a box of chocolates so do n't stay out in the sun too long without protection '', 
  to be clear though , the reason why it has been mentioned next to the first amendment so much is that some people believe it goes against their freedom of religion to be forced to give contraceptives to employees . 
  they are wrong , but that 's what they 're claiming . 
  i think it comes from not understanding that there 's a difference between freedom of religion and freedom to force my religious views on whoever i want but they ca n't do the same back to me . 
  an understandable mistake . 
  chill out pal , i do n't know why you 're bringing ron paul into this , i never mentioned him ( and think he 's an absolute dingus ) . 
  also , i was very , very clearly being sarcastic when i said it was an understandable mistake . 
  you mean terrists right ? 
  while it may be interesting , it should be noted that the myers-briggs is very outdated and based on outdated psychoanalytic principles . 
  not saying you should n't do the quiz , just saying that you need to take it with a grain of salt . 
  i realise you 're not using it for scientific data , i just want to ensure that no-one here believes that their results are accurate in a scientific sense . 
  watch porn even faster, 
  i 'm so confused right now . 
  i do n't know if i 'm an idiot , that was nonsensical or it 's some american reference i do n't get . 
  ... and that 's the story of how i met your mother, 
  sorry , i originally got there from a less credible [ website ] ( http://www.jwire.com.au/news/kosher-abbattoir-shut-down/22613 ) but thought this would be a more interesting link .

  unless you 're an australian , in which case all you get is an apology and a picture of [ russell crowe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ihad5.png ), 
  sit and wait for them to come back on . 
  i 'll probably die after a few days, 
  steve ? 
  you need to go speak to a psych ** ologist ** about the depression and your anxieties related to being sick . 
  i would say that what you 're describing would be considered an anxiety disorder but you should have someone see you in person to assess that . 
  as for your step-mother , she was just neglectful . 
  i doubt there 's a specific pathology involved . 
  you 're a magnificent human being,
