  as long as it work for colbert/stewart i 'm stoked,

  mental illnesses are most certainly real . 
  they have real biological bases found in different shapes and sizes of brain structures and levels of neurochemicals . 
  for example , you grandmother most likely had enlarged ventricles and a dopamine/serotonin imbalance . 
  people who say that mental illnesses do n't exist simply do n't understand the science . 
  there are huge costs of becoming larger and it 's unlikely to happen without an evolutionary pressure causing it . 
   i 'd guess 20 % of people diagnosed with it , the rest are dietarily unbalanced . 
  citation required . 
  studies actually show that genetics play a far larger role is adhd than environment . 
  there are some people who do n't consider adhd to be a real disorder ( they 're fairly on the fringe ) but they tend to argue that it falls on the outer end of the normal spectrum of behaviours . 
  `` dietarily unbalanced '' is simply incorrect . 
   i 'm not educated on this, 
  correct and it shows . 
  you 're talking about something you do n't understand and making incorrect statements . 
  there 's an incredible amount of research into adhd and working out why some children behave that way . 
  as for bipolar , i 'm not aware of any research that suggests it 's being over-diagnosed . 
  there 's a big difference between one of your friends going `` omg im so bipolar '' on facebook and it being diagnosed by a professional . 
  maybe women actually have an expectation that their body wo n't be violated now . 
  i do n't have a personal connection , i study it . 
  as for adhd , most would agree that it 's overdiagnosed . 
  however , i took issue with you blaming it on nutrition as it is wild , unfounded speculation . 
  as for bipolar nos , you need to understand that mental health disorders are n't always as easy to diagnose as physical health issues because they 're extreme forms of normal parts of being a person . 
  for example , it 's normal to have days when you feel down , it 's pathological if it 's for 2 months . 
  in addition , most disorders have some variation in their presentation . 
  for example , most people have some level of sleep disturbance and change in their eating habits when they suffer from depression but not all people do . 
  it would be a disservice to * not * diagnose someone with depression if they have most of the symtpoms but have n't changed their sleeping pattern . 
  for that reason , most disorders are classified as : must exhibit symptoms 1 , 2 and 3 and at least 3 of the other 6 . 
  bipolar nos is just a way of saying that you fit enough criteria of bipolar that it should be treated as such but your symptoms do n't feel neatly into bipolar i or ii . 
  funnily enough , it 's actually a way of making it ** more ** specific . 
  an extra week before my exams start, 
  haha thanks . 
  by minor ptsd do you mean a mild case of it ? 
  i have n't heard ` minor ptsd ' used as a clinical term, 
  even if i was a practising clinician , it would be improper to try and diagnose you over the internet . 
  if you were n't happy with your therapist , you should find a new one . 
  finding one you like and matches you is very important . 
  it sounds like you still have a lot to work through so i 'd recommend it . 
  if you have any questions about what sort of therapist/therapy or normal treatments for ptsd etc i can help with that though . 
  oh no problems at all , feel free to pm me if you have any other concerns . 
  king , queen , double , single in australia,

  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/top/ ) a list for you . 
  the thrill of having my cock in my hand , wondering if it 's going to be a half naked woman or someone stabbed almost to death . 
  sure , sometimes i 'm disappointed that it 's a half naked woman but that 's part of the fun . 
  at least she put the cards on the table . 
  better to know that shit early, 
  i had my name legally changed a couple of years ago . 
  my name is now notjesus, 
  it does n't matter if they 're a good idea . 
  if they 're large purchases and you 've told him that you want him to discuss it with you first , he 's doing the wrong thing . 
  he might still make the purchase anyway but he needs to discuss it with you and you need to be non-judgemental enough that he feels comfortable to do so . 
  do n't do anything spiteful , you 'll make things worse . 
  while it may not be as important as quacks , the formula is still the same ; confirmation bias , cherry-picking results and annoying people on facebook, 
  [ another clip that gives some useful information ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhl7gmbbn5g ), 
  the problem is getting medical advice over the internet is that anyone who knows enough to help you , is smart enough to know that giving most medical advice over the internet is a very bad idea .

  `` support being sexually attracted to children ? '', 
  no-one chooses to be attracted to be children . 
  i think acting on it is a horrific thing but who would choose that attraction ? 
  why do we include anyone in the debate ? 
  should we have a debate over whether people can have tumors removed ? 
  how about a debate over the antibiotics i 'm going to take to kill some bacteria . 
  i suppose we should have a debate over whether or not i can scratch my nose anymore , it kills more cells than an early-stage abortion . 
  it 's a fucking medical procedure . 
  it should be decided by doctors . 
  when i was in thailand i went to one of the best resorts and got a `` 6 hands massage '' . 
  basically 3 women give you a massage at the same time ( nothing dodgy , i was on the bed next to my so ) . 
  they were awesome trained and would do cool shit like one on each leg and the other on my chest and they 'd all move towards the middle at the exact same time . 
  it was like they had a routine or something,

  louis c.k came on here and spruiked the shit out of his online special and people loved it . 
  you need to just stop doing those shifts . 
  you will become very unwell if you try to maintain it . 
  a penis . 
  i am definitely anti-penis ( for my partner , mine is okay ), 
  i do n't think it 's even legal ( it 's not in australia ), 
  there have been some [ suggestions ] ( http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/11/30/legalizing.child.pornography.linked.lower.rates.child.sex.abuse ) that it would . 
  however , the problem is n't just whether or not it encourages sex abuse , it 's that putting children in pornography ** is ** sex abuse . 
  if you can make an argument for cartoons or young looking adults that 's different but putting children into the pornography is wrong . 
  note : dan savage talked to a researcher into child pornography and sex abuse on his podcast a few episodes ago . 
  do n't know the episode number but very worth a listen . 
  where the fuck is my back to the future style hoverboard ? 
  be able to not just empathise but genuinely try to understand why the other person thinks the way they do . 
  still on the front page pal, 
  it 's a parody of the rest of reddit, 
  nice try , delusional schizophrenic .
