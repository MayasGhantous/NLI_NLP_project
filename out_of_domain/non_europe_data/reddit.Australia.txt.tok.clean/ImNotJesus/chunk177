  unless you 're worried about cancer . 
  on the plus side , melanoma is very sexy . 
  i 've felt the way you feel and things got better . 
  they do n't have a chance to get better if you give up now though . 
  there 's no going back from that decision , you do n't get to try again . 
  how you feel this moment does n't reflect reality , you know it as well as i do . 
  the way you feel clouds everything , makes it all feel hopeless .

  go study physics and do it . 
   yes . 
  that 's why it 's not a law - it 's a theory . 
  in science , though , theories are basically facts . 
  the word ` fact ' is n't really used in that way in science . 
  everything is a theory because it 's our best working model , not undeniably true . 
  your apology was appears disingenuous because it sounds like you 're apologising for her reaction , not what you actually did .
