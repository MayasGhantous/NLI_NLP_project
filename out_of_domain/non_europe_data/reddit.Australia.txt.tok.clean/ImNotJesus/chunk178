  you need to speak to a doctor and if this is an anxiety issue developed in childhood it also may be valuable to speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  `` christian nation '', 
  `` big pharma '', 
  `` my naturopath said . . '', 
  `` aliens '', 
  `` my psychic said . . '', 
  `` government conspiracy '', 
  `` jersey shore '', 
  you 're a dick . 
  no and it can be a sign of psychopathology . 
  i 'd talk to a psychologist about it if you have access . 
  in the mean time , improve your sleep/exercise/diet and meditate . 
  assuming it 's a partner :, 
  normally , i 'll secretly light some candles and put a towel down on the bed with some nice music on and give a nice long massage . 
  if you use some sort of moisturiser or body oil it 's much easier on your hands . 
  otherwise , flowers are always good . 
  surprise dinner . 
  do a whole bunch of cleaning while ( s ) he is out . 
  what is loooooove, 
  had a 7am shift the night after my work christmas party . 
  to make it worse , i 'd been to a wedding the night before that and both nights got very messy . 
  felt horrendous and was working on about 8 hours sleep for the 2 nights combined . 
  / r/asksocialscience is awesome too although i wish there were more non-economics questions . 
  take your time , lots and lots of foreplay , expect to blow fast . 
  try again 20 seconds later . 
  use protection . 
  make a giant card or a video where you all tell the family how much he meant to you . 
  simple , easy and it will mean a lot to them . 
  just go with the flow pal , do n't overthink things . 
  no , not being neurotic is important . 
  sex is about being connected and in the moment with each other . 
  the less you think about performance and the more you think about just enjoying the experience together the more you 'll both enjoy it . 
  obviously you need to consider her needs ( foreplay , start slow etc. ), 
  but what she wants is to be intimate with you , not for you to have some magic trick that makes her cum ( does n't exist ) . 
  it 's just a day, 
  it 's almost certain she wo n't cum , get over that now . 
  guys suck until they get a fair bit of practice . 
  being intimate is far more important because a ) you 'll actually perform better and b ) it will matter less if you do n't . 
  no he 's a comedian and would refuse the award . 
  he loses his position as ` just a comedian ' if he does n't and that 's very important for the show . 
  easily , easily choose love of my life . 
  meaningless sex gets boring and it 's far , far better with someone you feel close and connected to .

  yes that 's rape and you should report it to the police immediately . 
  what he did goes so far beyond your friendship . 
  you need to report it today . 
  your friend is a scumbag and deserves to go to prison . 
  if you do n't report it , you could end up there too . 
  because the alcohol suppresses cns functioning which includes their prefrontal cortex ( the part of their brain that uses higher order logic ) and they therefore do n't have the same filters as normal . 
  why the fuck are you replying and not currently driving to the police station ? 
  he has n't yet . 
  not until he reports it . 
  ## here are my 32dds in a bra,

  i 'm more powerful than god, 
  more evil than the devil, 
  you * ca n't * see me, 
  but if you eat me you 'll die . 
  answer : [ nothing ] ( / spoiler ), 
  you still do n't know which is the right door . 
  is the answer to yours ? 
  [ which door would the other guy tell me to use ? 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  charming . 
  only the most sap in the world would think that 's an alright outcome . 
  your friend is a cock who needs to grow up . 
  how do we know you 're the best though ? 
  we could be fucking over someone else who is better and works harder . 
  i 'm not going to fudge a vote for you because we both go to a popular website . 
  `` i know i 'm going to get downvoted for this but i think republicans are pooheads '', 
  do you still enjoy life ? 
  are you an asshole to your friends/people you barely know ? 
  do you believe in unfounded conspiracies about the government/big pharma ? 
  i think it 's more being old than just miserly but my grandmother used to take a bunch of the little containers of condiments whenever we took her to maccas . 
  i ca n't cite any data on the correlation but from a psychological perspective , the common link is generally considered to be [ antisocial personality disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisocial_personality_disorder ) or [ psychopathy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychopathy ) ( the two are distinct but not that different ) . 
  they 're both basically just a disregard for the law , rules and rights of others characterised by an extreme lack of empathy . 
  there 's normally quite extreme emotional , physical and/or sexual abuse in these cases but it 's not always true . 
  not everyone with apd or psychopathy become criminals . 
  interestingly enough , one good predictor tends to be iq ( moffat and silva , 1989 ) . 
  the problem is , is that children ca n't be diagnosed with either . 
  therefore , there 's a separate diagnosis called [ conduct disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conduct_disorder ) . 
  conduct disorder is measured more by the acts themselves , than behavioural correlates . 
  for example , the dsm-iv-tr criteria includes things like `` often initiates physical fights '' , `` has been physically cruel to animals . '', 
  data from long-term follow-up studies shows that many adults with apd or psychopathy had conduct disorder ( robins , 1978 ; salekin , 2006 ) . 
  basically , the theory is the conduct disorder is the manifestation of apd that happens in children when the the same underlying causes exist in adults . 
  so , to answer your question : kids who are prone to cruelty to animals also tend to turn into adults who are cruel to people . 
  all information taken from barlow and durand ( 2012 ), 
  bad novelty account . 
  you do that outside . 
  outside . 
  you seem to be under the misapprehension that it 's purely physical or just a way of showing someone you like them . 
  like it 's a favour you do for the other person .
