  first of all , sex feels really good . 
  people like having it and the hormones you get early on in a relationship make you ** really ** want to have it . 
  what you 're not understanding though is that sex is n't just about physical enjoyment . 
  it 's about intimacy and caring and being close to one another . 
  if you 'd had sex with someone you did n't care about and someone you did , you 'd know this . 
  you 'd realise that sex with someone you care about makes you feel closer to each other . 
  it makes you feel like you share something with them that no-one else is allowed to share . 
  it makes you feel wonderful . 
  sure it 's messy and sometimes tricky but it makes relationships stronger and closer . 
  why do you assume that not having sex is the only way to keep sex as a `` big deal '' ? 
  that 's actually a really warped view on sex and you 'd realise that if you were in a relationship where you were having it . 
  you seem to think abstaining is a badge of honour or something . 
  to me , it 's a symptom of a naive understanding of sex or anxiety about having it . 
  i 'm not criticising you , you asked our opinions and i think that your view on sex is very immature . 
  i think if you 'd had sex in a loving , long-term relationship , you 'd know that you do n't ` lose ' anything , you gain . 
  you gain closeness , you gain intimacy . 
  and , you get much better at it too . 
  first substance i ever took caused me to shit myself and then fall asleep . 
  it was called breast milk i think, 
  `` it 's not your fault '', 
  every fucking time i cry my eyes out . 
  fuck you good will hunting . 
  and you should wait for someone who shares that belief if that 's important to you . 
  if that 's who you are and what you want , that 's your prerogative and should n't settle for less . 
  however , what we 're all trying to tell you is that your understanding of what sex is , is quite naive . 
  if you do n't want to have sex that 's fine but you came in here asking our opinion and then ignored everyone 's comments , simply repeating what you believe . 
  sorry but that 's my opinion . 
  i do n't think you really understand sex and i do n't think you understand physical intimacy and your views on sex show that . 
  i do n't mean to offend you and i 'm sorry if i did but i 'm just being honest . 
  i think one day you 'll realise that sex in an intimate relationship adds to the intimacy and connection instead of detracting something . 
  i wish you all the best of luck and you should do whatever makes you happy . 
  what do you think it adds ? 
  okay , imagine we 're dating and you say `` let 's go out for dinner to a nice restaurant '' . 
  i say back to you : `` i 'm sorry but i 'm fighting my instincts to have a nice dinner because i only want to share that experience with one person . 
  i ca n't be sure we 'll spend the rest of our lives together until we 're married so please respect that i ca n't go for a romantic dinner until we 're married . '', 
  what do you think at that point ? 
  i 'm not saying it is . 
  i 'm asking how you would respond to that . 
  i 'm trying to understand what it is about your perception of sex that has it so separated from all other experiences in life . 
  i want to know if you think it 's normal to arbitrarily reserve things for your ` one true love ' or whether you have an odd perception of what sex means in a relationship . 
  right so now consider sex from your partner 's perspective . 
  as far as she is concerned , sex is a great thing . 
  it 's fun , it makes you feel closer to your partner and builds attachment ( oxytocin is a helluva drug ) . 
  she wants to share that with you . 
  she wants you to be vulnerable with her , to connect to her on a level that you ca n't connect otherwise . 
  she wants to be physically * and * emotionally naked with you . 
  she might understand , she may even oblige but from her perspective , you 're missing out on not just a fun part of the relationship but also an incredibly important part . 
  instead , you tell her that you ca n't risk her not being the one . 
  you ca n't risk sharing something ( remember you 're not giving anything away , you 're sharing an experience ) with the wrong person . 
  do you think that will help her feel close/intimate/attached / safe ? 
  no problems at all, 
  `` honk if you have erectile dysfunction '', 
  the first week of dating my so i made her watching the departed , good will hunting and fight club . 
  her reactions to those movies is the reason we 're still together . 
  1 - put a towel down on the bed, 
  2 - light 4/5 candles, 
  3 - put some nice music on, 
  4 - find some moisturiser or massage oil, 
  5 - turn off the lights, 
  6 - gently undress her and cover her with a towel . 
  7 - give her the best massage she has ever had . 
  do n't tell her it 's to pay her back . 
  tell her it 's because you love her and she made you feel incredibly special and spoilt and now you want to make her feel the same way . 
  that may sound sweet but she would inevitably be traumatised . 
  like sure , it 's a noble act in that moment but if i had a choice i 'd avoid it . 
  in my sleep , having outlived my so by a day . 
  right , i 'm not saying that he should n't take the bullet , i 'm saying that if you can choose between any way you want to die , one that does n't traumatise your so is probably preferable . 
  if this is serious , you should take yourself to the doctor immediately . 
  tl ; dr if you 're depressed see a psych ** ologist ** . 
  exercise/good eating/good sleep/meditating are all bonuses but you need to seek professional help . 
  your teacher 's friend is a cock and most likely lying . 
  also , your teacher should teach you to use apostrophes when appropriate . 
  guys with small penises . 
  my condolences . 
  may your tongues be nimble and your endurance be hearty . 
  human body, 
   do n't eat beef products,

  let me just say that if god was a city planner , he would not put a playground next to a sewage system . 
  that you and your buddy need to grow up . 
  a psychologist should be the first you go to . 
  if you depression is resistant to therapy or your depression is so pervasive that it does n't allow you to go through therapy medication may be appropriate but that should be a discussion you have with your psychologist . 
  if you decide to do that , get him to write a letter to the doctor/psychiatrist to help inform your medication treatment . 
  hey , i had a good time at the dance . 
  then just start talking normally . 
  do n't obsess , she 's just a girl . 
  pffft like you 'll find people who work in it on reddit, 
  citizen 's arrest = / = power to remand and then put on trial . 
  except that what they 're doing is n't currently illegal, 
  i asked many teachers that and got no good response . 
  in general they told me it was modern convention . 
  it 's probably because it 's based on an archaic text that does n't stand up to logic or scientific scrutiny . 
  someone might be dead ... better ask if anyone on reddit has had a similar experience . 
  my surgery does n't seem to be going well . 
  what warning signs did you have that your surgery was n't going well ? 
  i 'm about to be in a car accident . 
  should i try to stop in ti . . 
  well to be honest , given your spelling ability a new college is n't necessarily the worst thing in the world . 
  all joking aside , your mother is crazy and you need to hope she calms down . 
  do n't do anything to make it worse and just try to remind her you 're still the same person .
