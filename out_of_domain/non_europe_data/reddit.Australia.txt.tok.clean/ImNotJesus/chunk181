  one does n't . 
  that 's how frat guys get girls to sleep with them . 
  it 's not how you meet a girl you want a relationship with . 
  if you want a fulfilling relationship , be yourself and you 'll attract the kind of girl that wants a nice guy ( the kind of girl you want ) . 
  i worked at a couple of football clubs ( australian ) . 
  most of the guys were really cool , some thought they were way too good for anyone ( generally the younger guys ) . 
  you go to the places where you 'll meet that kind of girl . 
  if you 're meeting a girl at a club or bar , it 's likely she 's looking for a cockier kind of guy . 
  have you tried online dating ? 
  worked for me . 
  not at all . 
  i thought the same . 
  then i tried it and went on a bunch of dates . 
  met my ex and my so ( who i 'll marry very soon ) . 
  it 's a bit of a crapshoot a times but if you go to the effort , it can work for you . 
  imagine there 's a triangle between the two pupils and the nose . 
  stick your gaze somewhere in that triangle . 
  wow . 
  take some history classes dude . 
  studying, 
  pyschological testing and measurement . 
  mind-numbing is n't even close to descriptive . 
  it would be interesting if your idea of being a psychology practitioner is watching people do tests . 
  til that woody harrelson is in a new movie called [ rampart ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/ ) . 
  on my right shoulder , knee to knee with the sheet in between to stop the knee contact . 
  i think it 's [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8eyy3/heres_the_christain_douchebag_chad_farnan_who_is/c092gss ) with possibly the best reply ever . 
  1 ) have you seen the movie rampart ? 
  a friend of mine in high school used to be terrified of pit stains so he put a pad under each armpit . 
  he said it worked a treat . 
  it 's not wrong but if you 're just doing it for free advertising you 'll get downvoted . 
  if you find a subreddit that would be interested and your content is good , no-one cares . 
  study after study shows that we adjust to money very quickly ( lottery winners are no happier 6 months after winning ) . 
  love and companionship is what life is about . 
  answer phone calls, 
  i ca n't imagine links will be allowed anytime soon and that was 99 % of what r/reddit . com did . 
  sure , you could and it would increase the value of money ... temporarily . 
  you 'd also hurt the economy , a lot and eventually that value would go back down . 
  give me a deposit for a house, 
  that 's not a question , you 're just making a statement . 
  because other people rely on you spending that money for them to make money . 
  in turn , they spend less money and other people who rely on * that * money spend less etc. 
  strong economy = money movement, 
  you 're misunderstanding what is meant by disease in that context . 
  you can have a disease caused by bad choices ( think diabetes ) . 
  however , the nature of addiction is so similar to a disease that it makes sense to treat it like one . 
  no-one is saying they 're a ` victim ' . 
  ps : sharon osborne is n't the apa spokesperson for mental health issues . 
  / r/atheism being a circlejerk . 
  it is . 
  of course it is . 
  the entire point of subreddits is that people go there because they share that view or are interested in that topic . 
  it 's not more of a circlejerk than / r/science . 
  in fact , i find / r/politics way more disappointing because it * should n't * be a circlejerk but it always turns into one . 
  if / r/atheism annoys you that much unsubscribe , it takes a matter of seconds . 
  i do n't go to / r/atheism myself but taking up a few inches on my / all page really is n't the worst thing in the world . 
  no-one on the bus will notice, 
  a really well made pokemon mmo, 
  parts of hypnotherapy are quackery , parts work . 
  really good hypnosis is basically a guided meditation where you 'll be taught to put yourself into that relaxed state . 
  bullshit hypnotherapy will talk about past lives or try and cause behaviour change by suggestion while in the hypnotic state . 
  find out which they do and if it 's the bullshit type , do n't go . 
  also , have you been seeing a psychologist ? 
  they should be your first port of call for depression . 
  it 's a serious disease and should be treated as such . 
  atheism is a religion in the same way that not collecting stamps is a hobby . 
  it 'd be interested to see the research on hypnotherapy and hpd . 
  do you have any links ? 
  they 've existed for a while but only started using the ` talking cure ' since freud . 
  dispatch broke up a few years ago and then reformed recently but they were basically the face of independent music during the napster drama . 
  in fact , i 'm pretty sure they hold the record for the largest independent concert ever . 
  we crave the things that were rare and helped sustain us ( sugar and fat ) . 
  we didnt ' evolve when supermarkets were around . 
  yeh but understanding of hpd has changed hugely since the days of freud . 
  if that 's you 're basis for assuming hypnotherapy is more efficacious then you 're likely wrong . 
  if you have a study i 'd love to read it though . 
  no problems, 
  andrewsmith touched me in my special area, 
  your solution is very , very simple . 
  stop . 
  also , learn to use some grammar , that was eye rape to read . 
  ahh to be 15 again . 
  try / r/askscience you 'll get a more technical answer, 
   this is just a rewording of a post ** that comes up several times a day **, 
  ftfy, 
  go speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  you may or may not fit the criteria for a major depressive episode but it does n't really matter . 
  if you 're this down , you need to speak to someone . 
  $ 20 for flowers to sleep with my so, 
  that my ex could deepthroat . 
  lost a lot of blowjobs from that . 
  you 're creepy . 
  that 's why they do it , they do n't feel comfortable with you . 
  my so would dump me . 
  her ass * does * look big in that outfit . 
  not listening to the questions i ask them . 
  `` okay , let 's start with your name '', 
  `` yeh ... hi ... so i was ... '', 
  lincoln and booth, 
  we were on a break, 
  do your own homework,
