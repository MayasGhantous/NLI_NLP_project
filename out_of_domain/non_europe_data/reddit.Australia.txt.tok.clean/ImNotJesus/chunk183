  edit : i just looked up my med school textbook . 
  it has to be olive oil , not just any cooking oil . 
  do not use peanut or vegetable oil . 
  find some olive oil . 
  have you ever wondered if you 're maybe transgendered and not gay ? 
  called a late-developing girl ( who was a friend that i knew was self-conscious about her lack of breasts ) that she was a surfboard because i 'd just learned the insult and thought it was hilarious . 
  she did not find it as hilarious . 
  still feel shit about that 10 years later . 
  i think it 's better but that your hair is the bigger issue . 
  spoon, 
  that compassion and empathy are the most important values a human can have . 
  if you have those , social issues fall into place . 
  no-one with empathy and compassion is banning gay marriage . 
  i think it 's an imperfect rule . 
  i like being lightly teased by my friends , other people do n't like that . 
  why not do unto others as they would have you do unto them ? 
  i did n't say it was a bad rule , i said it 's an imperfect rule . 
  there 's better . 
  cook them basically as you would a normal steak ( good sear on the outside , medium rare on the inside ) but make sure you rest it really well . 
  kangaroo will go very tough if it 's overcooked or not rested . 
  it has a lot of flavour ( quite gamey ) so you do n't need a lot of flavour with it . 
  here 's the thing about making conversation . 
  people like talking about themselves . 
  you can be a ` great conversationalist ' without ever saying anything . 
  just ask questions . 
  when they give you the answer , be interested and ask for more information . 
  try to relate what they 're saying to your life . 
  you do n't need to come up with a clever line or talking point , just ask them about themselves , it 's easy . 
  by realising that arguing on the internet is like being in the special olympics . 
  one of you will win but at the end of the day you 're both retarded . 
  that is perhaps the most awkward thing i have ever watched . 
  you 're an asshole, 
  yes, 
  tonnes of studies show that babies understand the basics of facial expressions . 
  it 's genetically coded-for . 
  except that if something is 1 | 0 is counts for no karma . 
  otherwise i could just keep replying to myself for more karma . 
  not that anyone would be that desperate for karma . 
  i hope . 
  i believe that when my brain stops receiving blood/oxygen i cease to exist because an immense amount of evidence suggests that the mind is what the brain does . 
  i am my brain , without it , there is no me . 
  it 's implicit within their answer that they consider faith to be enough . 
  it 's their way of telling you that their criteria for whether or not to believe is different to yours . 
  mistake, 
  the 7 seas . 
  for the booty, 
  tell her that things are n't working out and while you 've enjoyed your time together you do n't see a future . 
  the hammer is your penis ? 
  sounds like you need to spend some time talking to a psych ** ologist ** to sort out those intimacy issues . 
  as to your question , the answer is that you ** do n't ** . 
  do n't try to forget her because it wo n't work . 
  relationships ( or loss in general ) need to be grieved . 
  you need to grieve all those memories and thoughts about what you could have had . 
  do n't forget ; feel sad , accept that it 's gone and move on . 
  this is n't your last chance for happiness , i promise . 
  edit : lots of people are saying alcohol and it 's a very poor coping strategy . 
  there are 3 major types of coping style ; avoidant ( terrible long-term success ) , problem-focussed ( try to resolve the conflict/upset and find a way to move forward ) and emotion-focussed ( try to get rid of unpleasant emotions ) . 
  alcohol is a form of emotion-focussed coping and it does n't work . 
  you 'll wake up the next day and nothing precipitating the upset has been changed . 
  over time , the strategy becomes less and less effective and makes it harder for you to go through what you need to . 
  the main issue most people on reddit have is n't the existence of religion , it 's the effect that it has on people who do n't choose to be a part of it ( politics etc. 
  [ obligatory link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_common_misconceptions ), 
  it costs a huge amount of money and has little practical pay-off . 
  there is n't much else to do there either . 
  the better question is ; why are n't we investing all of that money into going to mars ? 
  do n't think of sexuality as a unipolar thing ( i 'm either gay or straight ) . 
  you 're allowed to be generally heterosexual and be attracted to some people of the same sex as you . 
  also , do you think you 're sexually attracted to him or are you wishing that your girlfriend had more attributes that he has ? 
  send her a message saying that you 're not feeling well so even though you 're excited about your date , you have to cancel . 
  work out a new date immediately ( so she does n't think you 're blowing her off ) . 
  that 's not really how hormones work , pal . 
  so how many days/months/years after spending their time/effort/money to make this film do you think it 's fair to use their product for free ? 
  does it depend on how much time/effort/money they spend or does it just come down to time ? 
  here 's a good rule of thumb : if you ca n't tell your so about it , you probably should n't be doing it . 
  have you ever masturbated while thinking about a guy ? 
  do you think you would enjoy touching your housemate ? 
  hmm i seem to be very tired , i should probably drive one-handed . 
  well it sounds like you 're attracted to him . 
  you may be bisexual or you may just be attracted to this one guy , there are really no rules . 
  try to work out why you 're not sure if you could go through with it ( are you worried about what it would mean about you ? ), 
  9:30 pm and i 'm at work, 
  there 's this brilliant natural painkiller derived from tree bark . 
  it has no side effects , super cheap to buy and very effective . 
  it 's called aspirin . 
  being compared to him is a genuine honour , thanks for making my night . 
  what the fuck ? 
  your mother refuses to buy you painkillers but wo n't let you get a job ? 
  you need to get out of that house immediately . 
  that 's not okay . 
  wow that 's a really horrendous situation and i 'm so sorry . 
  you should feel immensely proud of the bravery you 've shown by being out in such a hostile environment . 
  captain formfillerouterer, 
  `` do you think that it 's immoral to work for a ` news ' organisation that distorts news for the purpose of forwarding an agenda while attempting to portray yourself as fair and balanced ? '', 
  `` i should have paid more attention in english class . '', 
  straight afterwards say : `` i do n't mean this to be offensive , i 'm not trying to make a statement . 
  i 'm genuinely curious to know if you think that taking a specific slant on the news , be it liberal or conservative , but presenting it as fair and balanced is unfair to the viewers ? '', 
  correct . 
  they run past the hippocampus . 
  if you want to meet someone to start a relationship with , do n't do it in a place where the point is to get drunk . 
  find another way .
