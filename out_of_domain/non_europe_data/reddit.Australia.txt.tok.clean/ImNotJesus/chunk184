  despite early freudian ideas that dreams were an insight into the id , the evidence suggests that dreams mean very little . 
  some therapists will still use dream analysis because the act of assigning meaning to those dreams can be fruitful but the dream itself is simply a result of only a few parts of your brain being active . 
  because there 's no logical or scientific reason to think so . 
  i love giving surprise massages . 
  when my so is n't looking i put a towel down on the bed , put some relaxing music on , turn off the lights and light a bunch of candles . 
  then i give her a full body massage with moisturiser . 
  more often than not , yes . 
  actually half the time she sees the setup and before is a go too . 
  `` it 's not your fault '', 
  onions . 
  every time . 
  drink some water and go to bed, 
  you 're correct that you need medical help but i recommend you see a psych ** ologist ** . 
  they should always be the first call except for in cases of severe psychosis . 
  if they believe you need medication you can always use get them to refer you to someone ( with a letter outlininng your situation/pathology ) . 
  you need help , that kind of rage and loss of control is n't okay . 
  i would say it 's the belief by a surprising number of redditors that the world is worse than it 's ever been . 
  by all objective measures ( health , eqaulity , intelligence , crime rates , violence rates etc. ), 
  the world is becoming a better place . 
  access to 24 hour news and the availability/hindisght biases just makes you think it 's worse . 
  exactly !, 
  we need things to be more like the middle east and north africa !!, 
  that way we can have a bloody revolt !, 
  therapy and meditation . 
  both are proven to work . 
  alcohol/drugs will make you feel better for a moment but worse in the long run . 
  `` definitely not jesus '', 
  you 've never taken a paperclip ? 
  you 've never goofed off during times you were supposed to be working ? 
  you 've never pirated anything ? 
  you 're wrong and you should feel bad . 
  vague question is vague . 
  please define soul , it means a million different things to a million different people . 
  do i have some incorporeal life essence ? 
  i have no reason to believe i do . 
  this is a bit taboo in some relationships but you could always try having a conversation with her about it where you tell her about your feelings . 
  it 's risky , but it just might work . 
  had to read it 3 times but that 's actually very clever . 
  i used to believe that an invisible sky friend created the whole universe but left a whole bunch of clues to trick people that he did n't exist . 
  oh and he really cares if i touch my penis , even though he made it feel nice . 
  ron paul and not insane in the same sentence . 
  that 's cute . 
  incest is more complicated but beastiality is clear cut . 
  animals ca n't consent so it 's not okay . 
  i also think that polyamorous/polygamous relationships can work as long as they 're done respectfully and with full consent of the partners ( you 're not in an open relationship if you think you 're in one and your partner does n't , you 're just a cheater ) . 
  if you feel more comfortable with a man you should go with a man but it wo n't matter as long as they 're professional . 
  if he 's good looking he 'll be able to understand because i gaurantee you that you wo n't be his first patient to have that experience . 
  the most important thing is who you feel comfortable with and if their style of therapy matches your expectations/needs ( if you do n't know anything about the different types of therapy feel free to ask ) . 
  middle , obviously . 
  `` i think there 's been some sort of mistake '',

  no yes/no answer questions . 
  daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  `` fucking faggots '' it was in the thousands and followed by one of the best zingers in reddit history . 
  if you 're having panic attacks you need to talk to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  they can get worse and you should be seeking professional support . 
  best of luck . 
  perspective is a helluva drug, 
  crazy is an immensely vague word . 
  what you 're asking really depends on the type of psychopathology . 
  for example , a depressed person is far more likely to understand that they are ill than a delusional schizophrenic . 
  yes . 
  easy question is easy . 
  `` well this is a waste of my last few moments of life '', 
  it sounds like a very poor way to plug and gap and is not at all fitting with the bible . 
  it 's not grounds for a lawsuit because you ca n't prove damages . 
  she was n't very sensitive to your illness and i 'm sorry for that but you ca n't sue her . 
  til that in 2012 it was still a controversial issue whether or not gay people were allowed to get married . 
  my ex had juvenile athritis and had a hip replacement at 22 . 
  it 's a major surgery and should be avoided . 
  find a good doctor and talk it through . 
  try / r/iama, 
  unless you want to be incorrect . 
   is it fine to use bended as the past tense of bend ? 
  it is not . 
  because that 's not what the word bended means . 
  you 're subscribed to more than 50 but do n't have reddit gold . 
  i do n't know why it knocks some off and not others but you may just not notice the other ones .

  why after a month do you know the name she gave to her ex 's cock ? 
  wait , why after any amount of time do you know that ? 
  they named him manuel because he had a moustache, 
  or , if she was n't a virgin , she was immensely motivated to pretend that she was given that it 's very possible she would 've been stoned to death ( even if it was n't consensual ) . 
  you say first world problem like it 's a meaningful term in psychopathology . 
  many mental illnesses have different rates in different countries . 
  when was the last time you saw a case of kuru ? 
  religion, 
  you do n't just get to decide that copyright law no longer applies because you ca n't see a harm . 
  it 's still illegal . 
  they still own the rights and may decide to re-publish . 
  even if they do n't , you do n't get to decide . 
  it 's funny because the child would be humiliated and who does n't want to humiliate their own child ? 
   my boyfriend says he is n't comfortable telling me what he wants me to do . 
  i 've found your problem . 
  there 's no magic way to be good at sex . 
  there 's no a ` perfect move ' . 
  sex is about intimacy and communication .
