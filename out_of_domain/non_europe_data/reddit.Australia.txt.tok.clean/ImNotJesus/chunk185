  only someone with a very limited experience of sex thinks porn is good to emulate . 
  i went to school with identical twins every day on the bus for a few years . 
  every other person could tell them apart , i could n't . 
  read some of the books that are critical of religion and do it with an open mind . 
  see if their points resonate with you . 
  the god delusion makes the case that a god is incredibly unlikely . 
  god is not great argues that the god of the bible is an evil character and you should n't * want * to believe in him . 
  the end of faith and letter to a christian nation argue that religion as a construct is immensely damaging . 
  try reading any of those and see how you go . 
  yes you should you dingus .

  if it 's getting you that down , you need to go talk to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  you 're 23 , your loneliness is far from a foregone conclusion . 
  go talk to someone , get your head in the right place and then meet someone . 
  you 're not in the right frame of mind to do so right now anyway . 
  it 's about creating rules that make it better for both sides . 
  if both sides agree that killing civilians is a bad idea , it makes it a better situation for everyone . 
  it 's kind of like saying `` well you can knock people over in football , why ca n't i just use a knife ? '', 
  agreeing on certain limits makes sense . 
  anyone who can attest to your character/work ethic that is n't in your family .

  she was my girlfriend so we tried again a couple of days later and i was okay . 
  according the most contemporary psych literature , there are 3 type of coping :, 
  problem-focussed coping : attempting to change the problem that precipitated the upset ( removing the stressor , getting interpersonal support or accepting it ) . 
  emotion-focussed coping : trying to remove the emotion but not the problem ( drugs/alcohol , demanding emotional support ), 
  avoidance coping : not thinking about it or addressing it . 
  ** the only one that actually works is problem-focussed coping . 
  ** if you do n't change the cognition/situation , the upset remains . 
  it 's the hardest to do but by far the most efficacious . 
  edit : nothing i love more than getting downvoted for providing scientific info . 
  yup . 
  the dirty little secret about sex is that it 's difficult for a lot of people . 
  many people ( especially guys ) are n't used to be that vulnerable . 
  you combine that with anxiety about performance and societal expectations of sex , it 's no surprise that sex becomes incredibly complicated for a lot of people . 
  healthy sex in a committed relationship is wonderful but certainly is n't always easy . 
  i like that you realised this video needed no context or selling to hit the front page in minutes . 
  definitely . 
  my brain on ryan gosling 's body , i 'd be unstoppable . 
  good luck having an acting career with all that bizarre body hair ryan . 
  no it would take time for the mouse movement to travel to that monitor . 
  cables do n't send information faster than light , nothing can travel faster than light . 
  okay well let 's take the example of a fight in a relationship . 
  you 're upset about something your so did . 
  you have a few choices :, 
  problem-focussed - talk to her about why you 're upset and how it affected you . 
  you could then decide to forgive her , be consoled by the fact that she understands or enact a change in the relationship . 
  even if you do n't get the desired response , you can feel better for having explained where you 're coming from and have the opportunity to just understand that she is limited in a specific way . 
  emotion-focussed/avoidance : you could drink/do drugs . 
  you could go do something else for a while ( if it 's a small amount of distress this is n't always the worst thing to do ) . 
  you can cause her to react to you by either hyperactivating ( getting so emotional she has no choice but to take care of you ) or deactivating ( emotionally shutting her out ) . 
  you can pretend nothing is wrong . 
  all of these will take the distress away to some extent which is why people use them . 
  however , they do n't address the root cause of the issue . 
  with problem-focussed , did you notice that there was a resolution with each option ? 
  here , you 're hoping the problem will go away and in a lot of cases that wo n't happen . 
  it 's not always worth having a big discussion or putting all your cards on the table but if you leave distress ignored or do n't change the cognitive/behavioural patterns that cause the distress nothing will change and if anything , it will be worse the next time . 
  lopez went nuts . 
  also , you did n't actually play . 
  remember that he does n't have a maximum of closeness to share . 
  in fact , if he has female friends who he is open and close to , i would bet it would make it more possible for him to be that with you ( since being vulnerable is difficult and requires practice ) . 
  if you 're sure he wo n't cheat , you should enjoy the fact that he 's probably getting present and relationship advice off her that positively impacts on you . 
  having a female friend = / = treating her badly, 
  have you ever considered trying to skip step 1 ? 
  it seems slightly superfluous to me . 
   i 've always managed to restrain myself . 
  do you find it that difficult ? 
  it 's never been a problem for me . 
  do you regularly have morbid or upsetting thoughts that push their way into your mind ? 
  if so , they 're called intrusive thoughts and can be handled very successfully with the aid of a therapist . 
  if not , i would n't worry about it . 
  then do n't worry about it . 
  if you have the thought again , do n't try to judge yourself or attach too much meaning . 
  accept the thought is there and try to move on . 
  if it 's particularly distressing or common , talk to someone . 
  karma is analogous to social acclaim . 
  people want to be upvoted for the same reason you want someone you just met at a party to laugh at your jokes or think what you have to say is interesting . 
  who does n't want to feel funny or interesting ? 
  you could always try acting like an adult and a decent human being and politely but clearly tell him you 're not interested . 
  if they were so accurate , you 'd think they would 've predicted their own demise . 
  find yourself a good psych ** ologist ** , talk to them about who you are currently , why you think you are that way and who you want to be . 
  the phrase itself irks me . 
  it 's like saying i do n't ` believe ' in gravity . 
  belief has nothing to do with it . 
  or 99.9 % of the uses of the term socialism when discussing politics . 
  or say ` lol ' or ` wtf ' in real life . 
  * applause *, 
  i hate people misusing mental health terms . 
  it 's like saying oh god i feel like such cancer today .

  actually , i think alanis morissette created something of pure genius . 
  what could be more ironic than singing a song about irony where you list nothing ironic . 
  re-read what he wrote . 
  `` i just feel this connection to the earth . '', 
  really want to know what was said . 
  that 's my point . 
  thinking that it 's ludicrous to ignore an incredible amount of scientific information = / = atheism circlejerking . 
  i worry people wo n't know what it means,
