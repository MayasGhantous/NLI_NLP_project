  the doctor already told you she 's mentall ill . she needs help . 
  if she 's that much of a danger she needs to be in a home . 
  it 's not safe for her to live by herself anymore if the situation is as you describe . 
  if she 's ill , they can commit her against her will . 
  if your friend is upsetting you that much , why do you spend time with him ? 
  there 's no such thing as `` just delusional '' . 
  your doctor is either an idiot or you 're misunderstanding him . 
  delusions are a serious symptom of psychopathology and it sounds like she 's a danger to herself and others . 
  i 'm not going to try and diagnose her over the internet based on a 2nd hand assessment . 
  if she 's delusional and living by herself with weapons , you need to put her in a home , she needs care . 
  yay for quitting cigarettes !, 
  well done !, 
  i 've never done it myself but from studying withdrawal and addiction at university , i 've learned that many experts think it 's actually harder than most illicit drugs . 
  all of your achievements are brilliant and you should be immensely proud of yourself . 
  the most important thing i learned about it is that you need to make a distinction between a ** lapse ** and a ** relapse ** and realise that one does n't mean the other . 
  you may have a lapse but as long as you see as just a once-off you can get back on the horse . 
  if you 're really keen , one therapist i read about would get his patients to give him a cheque with the name of the person/organisation they liked least on it . 
  if they lapsed , he would mail the cheque . 
  each time they did it , the amount got higher . 
  the idea is n't to punish you but you want to stack the reasons to ** not ** do it bigger than the reasons to do it . 
  lastly , some really good recent research is showing that the trait of mindfulness seems to correlate with avoiding impulsive high risk/reward behaviours ( like impulse buying or problem gambling ) . 
  you can actually cultivate mindfulness by practising meditation . 
  it 's surprisingly easy and has a bunch of benefits ( meditation has been shown in the last 10 years to be a good treatment for depression and significantly reduces anxiety ) . 
  if you 're interested , go into itunes and search for ucla mindfulness . 
  they 're one of the leaders in mindfulness research and have some really basic guided meditations available . 
  i started doing it not that long ago and it 's made a wonderful difference . 
  if you want any more info of any of that , feel free to ask or pm me if you prefer . 
  as for me ; i quit caffeine a couple of weeks ago . 
  it did n't last that long but for about 5 days i had headaches that would literally make me buckle at the knees . 
  i had an absurd habit though , would drink up to 2.5 l of energy drinks a day . 
  really glad to be on the other side of that . 
  inb4 everyone replies `` relevant username '' . 
  also , well done !, 
  the song vienna by billy joel . 
  it changed my life . 
  it taught me to take a few moments to live and enjoy my life instead of always worrying about where i want to be by showing me that i was trying to succeed at life , not enjoy it . 
  i would be incredibly surprised if it 's legal . 
  it causes the vast , vast majority of drug and alcohol related deaths ( 80 % in australia ) . 
  why are you quitting ? 
  the point is that no-one can answer this scientifically . 
  anything will be a guess because no-one knows . 
  you do n't get orangereds from normal posts , only selfposts . 
  sounds like you have narcolepsy pal . 
  my so has it , i 'm pretty sure that 's what it is . 
  you 're wrong . 
  if it was schizophrenia the hallucinations would be at all times . 
  falling asleep at random times is called cataplexy and is only sometimes a symptom of narcolepsy . 
  either way , you probably have some sort of atypical sleep disorder and should see a specialist . 
  as a general rule , trying to distill an incredibly complex economics question down to a half-line agree or disagree is n't going to be very effective . 
  it 's much more complicated than you 're allowing for . 
  it 's called confirmation bias . 
  you notice the hits and ignore the misses because your brain evolved in a situation where noticing patterns was paramount and false positives were much more dangerous than false negatives . 
  either that or you 're a wizard . 
  probably the confirmation bias though . 
  i 'd turn a skateboard into a back to the future 2 hoverboard, 
  well i 'm pretty surprised you 'd get throgh a psych degree at a good university without realising how easily a cognitive bias would explain this . 
  also , you would be aware that confirmation bias is n't just when you 're consciously expecting something to happen . 
  it 's not worth risking . 
  without my karma , what would i use to substitute for genuine self-worth ? 
  facebook likes ? 
  am i some sort of animal ? 
  which is how you deal with this . 
  you tell him that you have absolutely no issues with the practice as long as he 's willing to steam clean the carpets each time the urine spills . 
  impressive . 
  without reddit i wait for more reddit . 
  i know you think you cant ' afford therapy but you 're going to kill yourself if you do n't . 
  your health is going to rapidly deteriorate the way you 're doing things and you just need to make getting help a priority . 
  find a psych ** ologist ** and get treatment . 
  you 're killing yourself right now . 
  unless you 're from australia i ca n't help you sorry . 
  do n't know what you have available where you 're from . 
  if there 's no access to anything , there are a couple of things you can do . 
  1 ) there are books that teach you how to use cognitive behavioural therapy ( the most common treatment for depression ) on yourself . 
  it 's a stop-gap solution but it 's better than nothing . 
  2 ) start exercising , even if it 's a little bit . 
  i want you to just start walking . 
  do n't push yourself , just aim to do any amount of walking and eat 3 meals each day . 
  each day you do that , you 're one day closer to happiness . 
  3 ) start meditating . 
  go to itunes and search for `` ucla mindfulness '' . 
  it 's been found to be a pretty effective treatment for depression . 
  it 's better if you 've got a pro teaching you but the free version is still very good . 
  those 3 steps are all very cheap and easy . 
  i just want you to do something positive every day . 
  it took a long time to get to where you are now and you 're not going to get out of it in a day . 
  the most important thing right now is that you know that each day you 're one day closer to where you want to be . 
  i also want you to message me with how this is going . 
  if you 're committed , i 'll support you . 
  message me with updates and i 'll help you . 
  unfortunately , a very brief read of op 's history gives me the sense that he does n't really want to change . 
  not on a deep level . 
  he wants things to be different but he does n't want to change , there 's an important difference . 
  i hope to be proven wrong and i hope he messages me but i 'm not confident . 
  nutella out of the jar with a spoon, 
  bad : i 'm neurotic and overthink everything, 
  good : i 'm neurotic and overthink everything, 
  i try to meditate for 10 minutes every day . 
  it makes everything else in my day better . 
  something you can learn for today : how to use the search function, 
  i 'd complain to the faculty about that .
