  this means that i can sometimes take too long to do tasks that do n't require it . 
  as a result , i try to monitor myself and see if the extra work i 'm putting into the task is worth it or not . 
  presently not a force for good . 
  that 's a very different question . 
  if it 's a serious concern and it affects your happiness and well-being , you should speak to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  they 're not just there for `` sick '' people and may be able to support you in getting through it . 
  here 's your first problem : it 's never wrong to feel a certain way . 
  part of the reason it lingers so much is that you fight and struggle with it . 
  instead , try accepting that it 's the way you feel but also realising that it 's not representative of what you really think of him . 
  it 's just a feeling and it will pass , just like all other feelings do . 
  you ca n't control how you feel , you can only control how you act . 
  he may be thinking the exact same thing , he also might not be . 
  it 's impossible to know from your story . 
  my best advice is make a small move that makes it clear to him that he can make a move but you still get plausible deniability . 
  for example , try to get some 1on1 movie watching time together . 
  you could cuddle up to him a little bit and see how he reacts . 
  also , it has n't been condensed into a picture with words surrounding it so it 's far too much investment for a redditor, 
  in press means it is n't published yet . 
  sorry , it 's behind a paywall , ca n't link you to it . 
  you can read heaps more about his work on his website though . 
  i deny your premise . 
  who says it 's gross ? 
  i enjoy it . 
  the problem is the setting . 
  those people are approaching you with a specific purpose . 
  i do n't think you can generalise it . 
  you 're being incredibly naive about why they 're talking to you . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  so you 're saying you used to like the term hipster but now it 's too mainstream ? 
  while i disagree with your slurpee flavour decisions , you make an excellent point if not 6 seconds too slow . 
  get really fucking bored . 
  wait for more reddit . 
  not even close . 
  also , you 're assuming that ( a ) all knowledge i want is available and ( b ) it 's not experiential . 
  i deny both of those premises . 
  who cares ? 
  he 'll be dead soon anyway !, 
  a modern assault rifle . 
  i then use it to garner power and influence with the leader of the nation . 
  if people are n't impressed , i no longer care . 
  the swiss . 
  can you kill someone with a corkscrew and a magnifying glass ? 
  super super drunk girl ( who had a giant bodybuilder boyfriend who was a friend of a friend ) asked me if i wanted to follow her into a bathroom stall . 
  i politely declined . 
  which is why i did n't say `` i would use it to conquer '' . 
  i 'm sure it would still be worth an immense amount to a leader who wanted to try and replicate the technology . 
  realise that you have absolutely no control over how other people act . 
  only focus on the things you can control , if you worry about the other stuff , you 'll turn yourself into a wreck . 
  be the person you want to be and be proud of that , you do n't need other people to act in that way for you to feel proud of who you are as a person . 
  if the content is good who cares ? 
  at the end of the day , if they 're adding something good it will get upvoted , if they 're not it will get downvoted . 
  i do n't really give a fuck if they 're using product placement if they 're giving me something enjoyable . 
  combination . 
  the whole thing happened very fast . 
  for added context , i 'd only met her that day and was looking after her ( despite being exceedingly drunk myself ) because her boyfriend had just been dettained for being wayyyyy too off his face in public . 
  we were getting some lunch and she asked me to show her where the bathroom was . 
  being a gentleman , i walked her out and she then asked me if i wanted to join her . 
  i said `` no thanks '' and went back to the table . 
  they 're going to maintain thousands of average accounts on different ips ( reddit automatically downvotes it if you upvote yourself with a different account on the same ip ) ? 
  if so , they 've earned it and i begrudge them nothing . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  so brave, 
  tom, 
  you 're inconsequential in regards to the universe . 
  no-one is telling you anything , it 's called the availability heuristic and confirmation bias . 
  people kept getting me confused with my gardner . 
  not an answer but some interesting info :, 
  did you know that a very similar question is used for a psychometric test for the moral foundations theory ? 
  basically , you 're given a series of hypothetical immoral situations and you 're asked how much money it would take for you to do that action ( options are $ 10 , $ 100 , $ 1000 etc. ) . 
  which hypotheticals would take the most money for you to do will actually say something about the construction of your morality based on 5 different facets . 
  it takes far more strength to admit emotional vulnerability than to pretend you 're bulletproof . 
  ~ ~ better luck next ti ~ ~, 
  at least you do n't have hepatitis !, 
  ... it 's a business . 
  if you do n't like the way they do things , do n't patronise them . 
  do your own homework, 
  it depends on their age . 
  just because you 're an atheist , does n't mean you have to hit them in the head with a hammer . 
  however , once they 're old enough , you explain it in terms they can understand and then reassure them that you 're going to be around for a long time . 
  it 's a hard concept to understand and process but everyone needs to learn how . 
  i agree that porn can create problems for some people and can give people unrealistic expectations of sex . 
  however , you do n't need pornography to masturbate . 
  you put your penis in the wrong hole, 
  get good marks and move on . 
  then go to / new and downvote the things you do n't like . 
  your opinion is worth no more than anyone else with a vote , get over yourself . 
  okay , here 's a great chance to grow up before college . 
  go out being the bigger person . 
  ps : despite school being incredibly easy for me , i really regret not studying in high school . 
  the study skills you learn are actually important and they 've made the learning curve in university steeper than it needed to be . 
  it sounds like you have a lot of anger towards your parents and it may be worthwhile speaking to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  it almost certainly is n't msbp and is just very , very poor parenting . 
  that was n't funny , you just wasted your own time . 
  way to sit on hold for 10 minutes for nothing . 
  `` spitting game '' ? 
  * shakes head *, 
  send her a private message saying you think it 's inappropriate and then unfriend her ? 
  do n't act like a child just because she is . 
  they 're some of them there acamademics, 
  i just like that you call them scumbags but give no context of the story .
