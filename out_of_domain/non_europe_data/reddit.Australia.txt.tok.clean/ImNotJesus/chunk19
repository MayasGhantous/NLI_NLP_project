  in the face of cognitive dissonance the natural reaction is ( through a combination of conscious and unconscious processes ) :, 
  a ) discredit the source of disconfirming information, 
  b ) add extra value to consonant information, 
  c ) take value away from disconsonant information, 
  d ) search for more consonant information, 
  e ) deny the value of the category itself ( new study shows that people think science has less ability to say right/wrong after hearing an article they disagree with ), 
  if all of that fails * then * they will potentially change their view .

  excuse me sir , you seem to have dropped this .

  my 3 year old cousin wanted to be in the room while i was in the shower and told me i had a bigger penis than her father . 
  why ca n't you just say : `` hey , thanks for the message , i was n't really clear whether you were asking me out on a date or as friends , sorry !, 
  either way , i 'd love to hang out as friends but have a personal policy that i do n't date co-workers . '', 
  if he asked you at as a friend you both laugh about it , if he asked you out as a date he can pretend he was asking you out as friends and has an easy out . 
  i 'm riding this karma goldmine right to the top !, 
  would n't stop me, 
  wait , i just realise , jesus probably never had breast milk . 
  maybe that 's why he could n't run away from the romans , too brittle .

  ahhhhhhh mesa love pizza, 
  but what if i need something that i accidentally threw out ? 
  my apologies , i misread your initial comment , please feel free to ignore me . 
  everything looks like pizza to me . 
  yes sir, 
  that 's some seriously full disclosure, 
  outliers - malcolm gladwell, 
  close second is : the moral landscape - sam harris, 
  sure . 
  first one i simply started by asking why the operator was an atheist and it kind of just all spread from there . 
  we talked about how we see the world differently ( i think faith is a virtue and he does n't ) and i learned a lot from it . 
  he 'd be able to play the shit out of a piano .

  depends on the exact mood :, 
  emotional - grace by jeff buckley, 
  really down - what a wonderful world ( version with kenny g - yes i know it 's ridiculously trite ), 
  angry - the ballad of booth ( from a musical called assassins ), 
  flat - fsu 1997 drum sequence ( it goes off and totally pumps me up ), 
  wallowing - one crowded hour by augie march, 
  i 'd hide in her foxhole, 
  come on dude , we need to know . 
  how big is it ? 
  for um ... science !, 
  am going to steal this and use it in many contexts, 
  he does n't say : `` you should do x , y and z '' what he does say is that if you talk honestly about societal well-being you * can * have a science of it ( think of it kind of like the notion of health - there may be slightly different goals but we can agree that vomitting every 10 seconds is `` bad '' ) . 
  it 's not about providing a guideline for living , it 's about providing a guideline for a healthier society in a scientific way . 
  obviously he explains it far better than i can but that was my interpretation . 
  his really , really , small shoes, 
  i do n't really know how you determined the research is n't true but for the sake of clarity the article says that there is an increased rate of atrophy in the amygdala . 
  you probably disagree with their conclusions ( stress from cognitive dissonance due to belief in unproven causes the extra atrophy ) but the science itself seems pretty solid . 
  maybe 6/7 times a day ... yes ... 
  i post a lot, 
  i 'm not really sure why people are downvoting this . 
  if you do n't think it 's a good service post why but i had a couple of good experiences there and want others to have the chance too if possible . 
  we do n't have to hate * everything * atheists do . 
  split it with you ? 
  [ his size ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/ho0nz/awkward_question_from_dad/c1wxid1 ), 
  nice . 
  i 've read tipping point and what the dog saw too and both are very worth reading ( in that order ), 
  my favourite part of this commercial is the subtlety . 
  looks so phallic . 
  freud would have a field day ... if he was n't dead and all . 
  on the plus side , if you run out of toilet paper ...

  right for skipping while using vlc . 
  i 'd get tonnes of karma from posting things as they came back up, 
  with your username , you probably should n't post in r/picsoflittlegirlsvaginas, 
  that 's the point of the study but it argues that more stringent beliefs have a larger effect ( the actual study talks about the strongest effect being in those who claim a religious vision ), 
  useless unless i can connect them like textas, 
  why , if they were controlling my brain , would they make me [ ] ( / fap ) 6 times a day ? 
  what purpose could it have ? 
  load ... blown . 
  i mean mind . 
  shit , i meant mind . 
  i love the right arm out for balance, 
  bitches love midgets, 
  holy shit -4445 karma in 1 year , 2 months and 10 days .

  i upvoted this when it was 4 minutes old , you probably had n't heard of it yet . 
  what an odd o face, 
  sounds like a justin bieber song, 
  you 're such a douchebag that i upvoted a comment calling you a douchebag despite the horrible butchering of the word `` you 're '',
