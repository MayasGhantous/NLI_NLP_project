  i wish you the best of luck . 
  fist fighting with family is n't inevitable . . 
  they do n't cost that much . 
  wow . 
  it 's like less than half of that here, 
  understanding the human brain . 
  in a way , it 's the most fundamental of all science because it defines how we experience the world . 
  the more i learn about how brilliant and flawed our brains are , the more fascinated i am . 
  that 's a really impractical solution and it can be dealt with in far better ways . 
  calm . 
  prolactin is a helluva drug, 
  you have to think of yourself as a cognitive miser . 
  anything your brain chooses to focus on takes resources away from other things it could focus on . 
  so , with limited processing power , your brain has to choose what to store and what not to store for two different reasons :, 
  1 ) your brain has a limited ability to keep several items in working memory and then process into long-term memory . 
  2 ) if you did remember ** everything ** imagine how difficult it would be to recall the right thing at the right time . 
  remember how frustrating it is to find the right memory or word sometimes ? 
  imagine your brain holding every piece of information you 've ever experienced . 
  it 's not practical and would hold minimal survival benefit . 
  remember , we evolved on the planes of africa , not in a world where we 're bombarded by sensory information . 
  eat more cumin, 
  getting very close to a year . 
  i use the same username for almost everything , except reddit . 
  i 'm a huge basketball junkie and would give anything to see a live nba game . 
  we have our own league here , it 's just terrible . 
  ` most ' men do n't . 
  normal people use tissues . 
  based on my understanding from his supporters , when he legalises weed the world becomes a peaceful utopia and we no longer need government departments . 
  are you telling me that the creationist , global warming denialist and conspiracy theory believing libertarian 's ideas do n't hold up to rational scrutiny ? 
   you must understand that there are two ~ ~ factions of ~ ~ ron paul supporters, 
  ftfy, 
  yeh we should privatise schooling like we did with the prisons . 
  that worked really well !, 
  apparently , when you give multi-billion dollar business to private industry and ask them whether they want to do things in a way that lessens their profit but is better for society they do n't often choose the latter . 
  watch the early ufcs . 
  there were no rules and royce gracie dominated . 
  go to sleep . 
  this is very , very bad for you . 
  australia - we have bogans ( boganic is the appropriate adjective ) . 
  they 're not that dissimilar to your rednecks , they like car racing , beer and racism . 
  they 're much less into jesus though . 
  your friend is an idiot and an asshole . 
  you probably should n't be friends with him . 
  why would i bother considering the implications of something that is untestable , unproveable and makes no practical difference in my life . 
  that which can be asserted without evidence , can be dismissed without evidence . 
  you 're a mexican apple thief . 
  i run the cider house . 
  i catch you hiding behind the stone mill . 
  you chase me into the tasting room . 
  oh , if there 's a crow in there : fine . 
  if not . . 
  i can live with it . 
  anyway , we 're all alone and you do n't speak a word of english , but you teach me more about hard cider than i ever learned from my fermenting exams and our passion is so loud that they can hear it all the way in the distillery ( breaths hard ) oh , ha . . 
  i can be such an apple slut !, 
  i did n't say i had no time to ponder , i said it was pointless and adds nothing . 
  redditting is enjoyable and therefore has a purpose . 
  hanson, 
  take notes of everything . 
  if it crosses the line go to hr . 
  take full notes of those meetings . 
  if fired , sue . 
  use old assistant as witness . 
  dolla dolla bills yo, 
  i just assumed if they were black it meant they only needed another few minutes in there . 
  what do you tell a woman with two black eyes ? 
  nothing . 
  you already told her twice . 
  why did the woman cross the road ? 
  who cares ? 
  why the fuck was she out of the kitchen . 
  you do n't sound like you need hospitalisation but suicidal ideation should n't be ignored . 
  i would recommend talking to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  this , by no means means you ** want ** to kill yourself and could mean a lot of different things but whatever it is , you 'll get benefit from discussing it with a professional . 
  your mother, 
  you could use the money for the cost of therapy !, 
  in the meantime , make sure your diet/exercise/sleep is regular and learning to meditate has been proven to have huge value in reducing depressive symptoms ( go to itunes and search for ucla mindfulness , there are some guided meditations that are really easy ), 
  that kangaroo is fucking delicious, 
  i believe there is no scientific or logical reason to believe in a soul . 
  the mind is what the brain does . 
  when your brain stops sending electrical impulses , you cease to exist . 
  the easiest way to show you this is in split-brain patients . 
  in some severe cases of epilepsy , it 's necessary to split the brain into 2 ( by severing the corpus callosum - the bundles of nerve fibres that connect the two hemispheres ) . 
  when this happens , people essentially have two brains . 
  it 's remarkable . 
  there 's a youtube video where v.s. 
  ramachandran talks about one patient who had one atheist hemisphere and one theist hemisphere . 
  talk to your child . 
  do n't make this weird for your child by pretending it is something that it is n't . 
  `` mummy and daddy were giving each other special cuddles that parents sometimes give each other '' . 
  sure !, 
  psychics are believed to be so for a combination of reasons :, 
  1 ) cold reading : this is ambiguous information that is used to lead the viewer to fill in the gaps . 
  2 ) barnham statements : statements that could apply to almost anyone . 
  `` he had a good sense of humour '' . 
  who does n't think they have a good sense of humour ? 
  3 ) confirmation bias : study after study has shown that people 's perceptions are changed by what they want to believe . 
  you remember the hits and forget the misses . 
  if you had a session with a psychic and actually recorded the whole thing , recording the hits and misses , you 'd be very surprised . 
  4 ) some psychics simply do research . 
  television psychics will have microphones in the audience or hire private eyes .
