  alternatively , some will simply repeat back information you 've already told them . 
  whatever it was that spoked your sister , i bet there is a very logical answer . 
  either she remembers it being much more precise than it was ( took something that kind of fit and remembered it as fitting well ) or confirmation bias simply meant that she ca n't rationally analyse it because her perception is flawed ( that 's not a criticism , everyone has flawed perceptions ) . 
  give her time then . 
  she 's clearly in shock . 
  sounds good . 
  some tips : do n't give her any information before you start . 
  when you listen to the recording , count her many times she says something right and how many times she says something wrong . 
  also , each time there 's a right answer , try to work out if there 's a way she could know or if it 's very common ( for example , i 'm sensing something to do with the chest - most old people die of heart/lung issues and even if it 's not the root cause , it can be a complication when unwell ) . 
  also be aware of things like `` does the month march mean anything to you ? '', 
  there 's a million things you could think of ( your/someone else 's birthday/anniversary/special occassion . 
  you could have done something in that month etc. ) . 
  it 's almost certain to be a hit . 
  people kept getting me confused with someone else . 
  i 'm genuinely terrified right now, 
  [ eagerly awaiting my picture ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9t7tejwcyrg/tacte437xai/aaaaaaaaabq/i1-1jzvbdgq/s1600/6-fat-man.jpg ), 
  step two : if no culprit is found , high five grandma . 
  actually . 
  make her wash her hands and ** then ** high five her, 
  looking at porn = sex addiction ? 
  99.999 % of reddit just became sex addicts . 
  this is no time for helpful information , we need grandma porn puns stat . 
  most likely a box in the ground . 
  obligatory weirdest boner joke, 
  encourage her to see a professional . 
  you 're not qualified to fix this . 
  edit : that being said , you 're definitely qualified to support her . 
  your job at this point is to support her by listening and doing what it takes to help her get to a psych ** ologist ** ( offer to drive her or make the initial contact with the therapist if she 's nervous ) . 
  ** it is not your job to make her better ** , it 's just your job to make sure she has all the support you can provide . 
  you 're not supposed to eat the top, 
  you ca n't possibly say that based on the information at hand . 
  you 're projecting , pal . 
  look , you 've clearly had some bad experiences in the past but not all people going through a rough period in their life are manipulative . 
  he certainly should n't stay with her * just * because she needs support right now but he also should n't abandon her because of it . 
  it was awkward for all of us, 
   she is using him as a human shield, 
   it 's best to break off all contact with those types of people, 
   she will use psychological pressure to make you stay , make you think you 're the reason she is still alive . 
   she is looking for excuses, 
  i was elaborating on my point . 
  i wanted to make it clear that i do n't think he has any duty to stay . 
  as for what you 're saying , you very , very clearly have a large emotional investment and have had a bad experience in the past and that is affecting your advice . 
  okay . 
  i 'm going to stop replying to you because it 's become pointless very quickly . 
  in fact , a lot of researchers believe you can go into rem debt . 
  hypnotism puts you in an altered state of consciousness that is similar to stage 1 sleep ( sleep goes through cycles from 1-4 and then rem ) . 
  you need the other stages . 
  sounds like a terrible way to rebuild trust . 
  you 're welcome to do it if you want but i think it 's a terrible idea and will only lead to more problems . 
  the way to stop judging her is to slowly forgive her , not to try and get even . 
  in fact , if i was in that situation and was offered a free pass , it would only make me question her understanding of my expectations in the relationship . 
  unrelated question : what * is * stage 3 of the mod application process and why is it taking so long ? 
  are there actually stages or is mod activity so low that you ca n't even look at them ? 
  it can , if you want it to , but it 's certainly not easy . 
  things will never be the same again but that does n't mean that the relationship * needs * to end . 
  no-one can decide that but you . 
  that 's not a reason to stay with her . 
  it 's not fair to either of you if you stay with her out of fear that you 'll hurt her . 
  thank god because i 'm really holding a lot of tension in my neck right now . 
  i do n't agree with anything you just said . 
  mods can you please remove this ? 
  in a few hours can you give us an idea of how many times your post was reported ? 
  i think it 'll be at least a few hundred . 
  no they 're not actually having sex ( besides a few exceptions ) . 
  normally the guy has a sock on his junk . 
  it 's fairly accepted that erections will happen , no-one would be offended or consider it awkward . 
  because the fabric is an incredibly small percentage of the costs of making it . 
  no because sanity, 
  you should get a thermomix . 
  same price , way more ability, 
  do your own homework, 
  no stress at all . 
  i appreciate the answer, 
  make up your own mind . 
  read some atheist literature ( the god delusion , god is not great , end of faith , letter to a christian nation etc. ), 
  and decide for yourself . 
  i assumed he 'd had some exposure given his background but it was probably an oversight not to mention it . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with that . 
  if you 're an atheist * or * a theist and not talking out against fundamentalists or extremists of all kinds , you 're doing a disservice to everyone else . 
  if i were a moderate theist , i would be appalled at those out there giving me a bad name . 
  agnostic does n't mean `` not sure '' . 
  i think * you * need to look it up . 
  tell her to read and listen to everything dan savage has to say . 
  just simply do n't get involved with any bitching/complaining about management/the organisation . 
  go in , put your head down and do a good job . 
  i feel like i 'm looking at an emo 13 year old 's facebook page, 
  okay here 's what you do . 
  it 's tough but i think you can handle it . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  unicorn, 
  are you 70 and live in florida ? 
  do ** not ** take cold and flu tablets and then drink . 
  i 'd go back a few days with the lottery numbers and give myself a tip-off, 
  do your own homework, 
  studies show that winners of the lottery will return to their base level of happiness after 6 months . 
  no thanks . 
  why the fuck would n't you instantly go to the irs ? 
  i did , decided i did n't want it and went back to college . 
  now i 'm about to start my honours in psychology and could n't be loving it more .
