  if we did n't have repeat questions there 'd be 4 new ones a day and 3 of them would n't actually be a question . 
  studies also show that people are really good at convincing themselves that studies do n't apply to them but you probably do n't think that applies to you either . 
  the point is n't that your life is n't objectively easier , the reason it happens is that happiness is a relative thing . 
  there 's a reason people with 5 billion dollars really care how much money their business makes . 
  it 's because we anchor to a new position . 
  the same famous study about lottery winners had a group of amputees . 
  their happiness went down and also went back to their baseline after 6 months . 
  there are n't many recession-proof careers but it seems like no matter how bad the economy is , cancer was still able to get jobs, 
  initiate physical contact first ( touch her hand/shoulder etc. ),

  if she responds positively , move in to kiss her slowly . 
  move 90 % of the way and she should come to meet you . 
  start slow , do n't try and clean her tonsils with your tongue , just lightly open your lip .

  ** moooooo **, 
  never combine a strong overnight laxative and sleeping pills . 
  it 's a mistake you only make once . 
  2012 - when people started announcing political campaigns on twitter . 
  also , if you 've ever had truly passionate and intimate sex , you 'd realise it was a lot more enjoyable and fulfilling than the craziest one-night stand you 've ever had, 
  you seem to be forgetting therapy . 
  hundreds of studies of the efficaciousness of several different types of therapy seem to suggest otherwise . 
  there are always cases of remission but they can be reduced ( follow-up treatments , doing cbt homework , extending treatment beyond cessation of symptoms etc. ), 
  except that most types of therapy are designed to give you the tools to not need therapy anymore ( psychodynamic - better introspection ; cbt - understanding of cognitive traps ; act - understanding of happiness traps etc. ), 
  of course self-doubt will creep in , it 's human nature but therapy should allow you to not be depressed anymore . 
  first of all ; you 're welcome to disagree but i 'm talking about scientific research , not my opinion . 
  secondly , there 's a very big difference between having a tough time and being clinically depressed . 
  the precipitating factors still exist ( neuroticism etc. ), 
  and some people do suffer from depression again but it 's certainly not a foregone conclusion . 
  the idea behind therapy is that it is there to stabilise and make you able to deal with the causes so that the underlying factors are gone by the time you stop taking the medication . 
  i personally believe that anyone who is on an anti-depressant should be having regular therapy but it 's definitely not always done that way . 
  you are right though and sometimes getting a bit of stability back can knock things back into place . 
  key word being ** some ** . 
  it 's certainly not guaranteed that you 'll have it for the rest of your life and if you do , you 'd be in the minority . 
  i do n't think it 's right to say that the hereditary element of depression means it 's a permanent sickeness . 
  if i have a heriditary trait that makes my bones slightly more brittle , that does n't mean that broken bones are a permanent sickness , it means that i 'm more likely to get a broken bone . 
  not all people with the common precipitating factors get depression and they certainly do n't all have it for life . 
  i did n't say that i know what your medical problems are . 
  i 'm sorry if i offended you but all i 'm trying to do is make clear the difference between suffering from depression and feeling some of the symptoms of it ( which , as you also know , are normal within a certain range ) . 
  it 's an analogy, 
  there 's no such thing as a bad reason to be depressed . 
  it 's never not okay to feel what you feel , all you can control is how you react to them and it takes far more balls to admit that you 're hurt and vulnerable than it does to pretend nothing is wrong . 
  i hope you 're still seeing your therapist from time to time to ease through this transition and ( s ) he knows you 've stopped taking the meds . 
  best of luck , pal !, 
  as someone who has had depression ( i now consider myself depression free ) and studies psychology i do n't consider depression a terminal illness . 
  i think we 're talking about different things here though . 
  i do n't act/feel like a depressed person anymore and my symptoms would mean that i do n't fit the criteria . 
  however , the parts of me that lead me to the depression do n't go away , i just learn better ways to deal with them . 
  for example , i 'll always be an anxious person who wants to avoid feeling vulnerable and will want to suppress any negative feeligns . 
  that does n't mean i 'm depressed anymore , it means that i need to always fight to make sure that i do n't become depressed again . 
  i guess the point i 'm trying to make is that the other side exists . 
  i 'm experiencing it as we speak . 
  not out of bounds but timing and tact are important . 
  sever ties immediately , even if it costs you some money in the short-term, 
  it can be caused by a bunch of different factors . 
  one believed to be responsible for a lot of religious visions is [ temporal lobe epilepsy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temporal_lobe_epilepsy#temporal_lobe_epilepsy.2c_neurotheology_and_paranormal_experience ) ( watch the documentary about the god helmet for more on that ) . 
  tell him a psych undergrad student in australia thinks he 's awesome .

  asked my auntie why she had a moustache, 
  having other people believe the same thing as you makes it more okay for you to believe it . 
  you did n't do anything wrong . 
  he decided to make a stupid decision and is paying the consequences .

  i do n't think pad thai will do much, 
  savage love, 
  yeh , i think the drunk passenger is the best judge of that too . 
  the fact is , .085 is higher than a lot of other countries and if you 're not an idiot you do n't drive if you think you 're even close . 
  also , you do n't need to be hammered to be impaired . 
  driving with a ` buzz goin ' still hugely increases your chance of being in an accident . 
  your role is simple . 
  support do n't fix . 
  let her talk it through ( ask questions ) but do n't try to make things okay , you ca n't . 
  they 're different and do different things . 
  a psychiatrist is n't appropriate for this . 
  i 'm sorry but your understanding of the difference is simply incorrect . 
  a psychologist is n't just a badly trained psychiatrist , they do different things . 
  a psychiatrist is primarily focussed on medication whereas a psychologist is primarily focussed on therapy . 
  intimacy syndrome does n't sound like something that requires medication so going to a psychiatrist is a little bit pointless , you 're better off going to a psychologist who will be better trained in therapy .

  matzah is in the top 5 reasons to become an atheist . 
  in fact , it 's probably # 2 after bacon . 
  no-one likes matzah, 
  outlier, 
  it 's also always worth remembering that we have an innate bias towards type 1 error instead of type 2 . 
  type 1 error is a false positive ( i think there is something but there 's nothing ) , type 2 error is a false negative ( i think there 's nothing but there 's really something ) . 
  imagine you 're an early homonid in africa and you hear a noise . 
  your options are to assume it 's nothing and continue on or assume it 's something and run . 
  if you assuming nothing and you 're wrong ( even if it 's right 99 % of the time ) , you 're going to be lunch 1 % of the time . 
  we 've evolved to notice patterns and take meaning from them . 
  my so still gives me a hard time for finding an excuse to tell a story that involves me having large feet on our first date . 
  break their legs and then stick them in a dark room where there is n't enough room to sit/lie with legs straight out for days on end . 
  a lot of people would be very disappointed, 
  that sounds fairly typical of depression . 
  you have what would be described as a general flattening of mood or [ dysphoria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dysphoria ) . 
  you may get value out of talking to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  since you 're fairly introspective , that will be of great value and allow you to uncover the underlying causes of your current mood issues .
