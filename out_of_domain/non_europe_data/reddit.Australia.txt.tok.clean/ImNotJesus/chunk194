  if you 're wondering about neurochemical issues , low levels of serotonin are found to correlate with depression but you ca n't really say that it causes it ( brain and depression are far too complicated ) . 
  if you 're asking what chemically causes mixed emotions , the answer is that emotions are not understood anywhere near well enough to say that . 
  because that much power would require a prohibitively big windmill . 
  also , the bigger the windmill , the more weight on the car and the less aerodynamic . 
  the more weight and less aerodynamic , the more power is needed etc. 
  `` scientists have discovered a pill that makes you able to use 100 % of the brain . '', 
  fuck you limitless , even if the 10 % thing was real , that makes fuck all sense . 
  the jews , most certainly , did ** not ** build the pyramids . 
  not only were they not in egypt until well after the pyramids were built , the old testament never even says anything about the pyramids . 
  all of it . 
  if neurons are n't used , they die . 
  it * is * possible but they 're also full of shit . 
  the mistake most people make is being to obvious . 
  post something like this : `` i just wanted to thank all of my friends and family for supporting me through my coming out period . 
  i know this is an adjustment for everyone but your support means a huge amount to me . '', 
  i know that there * are * 50 states and i would recognise almost all of them but could n't list them . 
  my second toe is significantly longer than my big toe . 
  it makes shoes much less comfortable because it causes my toe, 
  to fold up, 
  `` i would n't know . 
  she never lets me park there anymore . '',

  edit : ooo just learned about / r/nottheonion . 
  it 's the funniest subreddit i 've seen . 
  evolution by natural electrician, 
  `` you know what they call alternative medicine that has been proven to work ? 
  medicine '' - tim minchin, 
  it 's called [ hyperinflation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation ) and unless you want your economy to become like zimbabwe 's , i do n't recommend it . 
  feels bad man . 
  had a cotton bud up there , possibly the worst experience of my life . 
  weiner 's weiner, 
  this requires more story, 
  because it is n't funny . . 
  as you may have just realised ; typing / r / before the name will automatically link to it ( does n't work if you just use r / ) . 
  even if you assume that we live in a deterministic world , the illusion of free will is fundamentally identical to actual free will . 
  nothing has to change if you accept determinism . 
  also : there are far better arguments for no free will than chemistry ( read sam harris ' work on it ), 
  the point of homework is to extend the child , not get them to repeat work they already know . 
  what would be the point of that ? 
  i like sam harris ' term ` conversational intolerance ' . 
  i do n't think that people should be ridiculed because it 's counter-productive . 
  however , i do think people need to be held to account for their views . 
  if you believe false things , you should pay a price in people not believing what you say . 
  edit : [ watch this ] ( http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ccyqtwiwaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dwwg9pdnsaxa&amp;ei=rsplt4xhgmjumaw8h726dw&amp;usg=afqjcnfj_mh3iwmjytgc2l8tzd9v4yidqa ), 
  there 's no reason to believe that will ever happen . 
  even if the equation was possible ( it is n't ) the ability to calculate that is n't guaranteed, 
  fundamentally identical from the perspective of the person experiencing it would probably be more accurate . 
  have you considered ongoing therapy from a psych ** ologist ** to treat the ptsd ? 
  medication is very helpful for bipolar but regular therapy can be of great value to both issues and can make an underlying change , as opposed to treating the symptoms . 
  `` i 'm not a taxi driver but ... '' will be the most common answer i fear, 
  there 's no such thing as `` love at first sight '' . 
  that 's called lust . 
  if you 've ever been in love you know that love is much more complicated and deeper than that . 
  leader of a new religion ? 
  seeing a psych ** ologist ** does wonders . 
  told my step-brother about santa, 
  `` she also uses google . 
  i can use this ! '', 
  stay adequately hydrated . 
  do neck stretches . 
  however , if you 're getting regular headaches you need to go talk to a doctor . 
  it 's lonely being the only human, 
  we 'd have to stop calling them quarters, 
  / r/pokemon, 
  if the thoughts are intrusive ( come in unexpectedly and you ca n't get rid of them ) it would be worth speaking to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  it almost certainly is a result of your childhood and would be worth talking to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  avoiding vulnerability ( being close to people ) is very understandable given how much you were hurt by people you trusted . 
  talk to a professional so you can learn to work through this . 
  there 's no hard and fast rule and it depends on how important it is . 
  there are three types of self . 
  there 's the real-self ( that 's who you are ) , there 's the ideal self ( that 's who you * want * to be ) and the ought self ( who you think you * should * be ) . 
  if you 're becoming upset because you 're not something , you need to work out whether you 're upset because it 's what you ** want ** to be or what you think you ** should ** be . 
  if you chase the should , you 'll always be disappointed . 
  however , if it 's something that you ca n't control , you need to accept it and not fight it . 
  do n't pretend it does n't exist , do n't pretend it does n't affect you . 
  sit with however that makes you feel and give yourself the permission to be okay with it . 
  i just call them lefty and righty, 
  watch the movie office space . 
  you 're being unfair to both of you if you stay with someone you 're not attracted to . 
  you 're not going to instantly become more attracted to her and you need to do the right thing by both of you . 
  you ca n't . 
  if you 're having significant regret , you may want to talk to a psych ** ologist ** about your feelings and attitudes towards sex as it sounds more like a personal psychological issue . 
  however , i 'm not aware of any specific research or a neurochemical basis for what you 're describing . 
  you sound like a cock . 
  you need to stop telling people and calm down . 
  i know you 're angry but you do n't want to ruin her life . 
  be the bigger person . 
  go be with your dad , console each other and try to move on . 
  you do n't want this . 
  if she 's having breakdowns you need to encourage her to speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  in the short-term ; exercise , meditation and a good sleep schedule can make a difference . 
  this is medical advice and not appropriate for the subreddit . 
  please do n't take any drastic health decisions without consulting a professional first . 
  if you 're concerned you should speak to a medical professional . 
  this is n't an appropriate forum for medical advice . 
  neither . 
  i 'm giving myself lottery numbers,
