  if they did , narcissism would serve no purpose . 
  it 's a defense mechanism . 
  i have nothing but pity for this guy honestly . 
  imagine having such a terrible self-image that you need to convince yourself that the only way a woman would sleep with you is by tricking her . 
  that 's really what it comes down to . 
  this guy wants to ` act ' like an arrogant asshole to trick women into wanting to be with him . 
  self-delusion is one of the primary symptoms of npd . 
  if a potential employer asked me for that they 'd be doing me a favour . 
  they 've just saved me however many months it would 've taken to realise that i did n't want to work there . 
  it 's kind of like being asked for your star sign on the first date . 
  big time saver .

  well you keep talking about this amazing answer that makes all women attracted to you but you refuse to actually say what it is . 
  i 'm sorry that you had a really hard time be social when you were younger and i really hope you can get some help and talk through some of these ideas with a psych ** ologist ** so you can hopefully move on . 
  this path you 're on will only lead to a very unfulfilling life and i wish you the best of luck in finding some happiness . 
  if you want to seriously discuss this stuff , you can feel free to pm me but i do n't know that you 're ready to admit that . 
  yeh , totally agree . 
  besides anything else , this kinda guy hurts other people by convincing them that sex is something you `` get '' from women . 
  it 's a horrible attitude and leads to a very un-fulfilling sex life . 
  i 'm listening pal . 
  * crickets *, 
  there are some accounts i 'm ** really ** hoping wo n't respond to this . 
  i can think of one . 
  there is n't really a scientific consensus on dreams . 
  the basic split is between people think that it 's a way for your brain to process memories/unconscious information . 
  other researchers believe that brains are a result of a large part of your brain ** not ** functioning . 
  when large parts of your brain are n't functioning , the results are not reality-based . 
  i like you herborist . 
  bit of neurosci gets me hot and heavy, 
  i 'm a brain science slut, 
  politics is important . 
  reading self-posts about how we should use slacktivism to change , sensationalised titles and complaining about fox news is n't . 
  about 5 minutes . 
  if it 's bright pink , that means it 's ready . 
  my prediction is that a bunch of really stupid people will get worried and the same thing as all the other doomsday prophecies will happen . 
  if this is affecting your life , you should talk to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  they can be very helpful and are n't just for the `` sick '' . 
  yes go to the doctor . 
  [ denis dutton : a darwinian theory of beauty - ted ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html ) . 
  i 'm far too modest . 
  besides that i 'm pretty perfect . 
  no offence but ... 
  99.9 % of novelty accounts are n't funny after the second time ( if at all ) . 
  the only thing worse is the person below then posting `` look at the username guys '', 
  met my so . 
  gon na marry her soon . 
  he did n't pull anything ... he genuinely had a date . 
  i do n't understand your upset . 
  first girl i met online was only my 2nd date ever so i was super nervous . 
  i probably went on 10 dates total and had a relationship with one girl before my so . 
  we 've been going out for over 2 years now and live together . 
  it still sounds like you guys are assholes and i ca n't at all blame him for not wanting to hang out with you . 
  i had a friend attacked by a drop bear once . 
  he lost most of his left arm . 
  there 's nothing wrong with crying as a man . 
  you should be incredibly glad that you have the emotional intelligence to be in touch with how you feel . 
  it 'll make you a better and stronger person and you 'll make a woman very lucky to have you . 
  i 'm sorry that your parents do n't get that but try to remember that they came from a different time . 
  as for having better control over your emoptions , the key thing to remember is that you ca n't . 
  the key is accepting that you have your emotions and that you ca n't change how you feel , only how to act as a result . 
  do n't fight them , be who you are . 
  there 's obviously a need sometimes to try and put your own thoughts aside and be there for others but that will come with time and practice . 
  i could tell you what it is , but then i 'd have to kill you . 
  * thank you , thank you * . 
  i graciously accept the ` most obvious joke of the day award ' . 
   and tell myself how fucking stupid i 'm being until i pull my shit together . 
  this kills the emotional well-being, 
  have you ever tried mindfulness meditation ? 
  it 's had some incredible research over the last 10 years and is being used in therapy quite regularly now . 
  the idea behind it is learning to have conscious awareness of your mind/body without the story attached to it . 
  give it a shot - go to itunes and search for ucla mindfulness . 
  they 've got the leading lab on mindfulness and give you some guided meditations to try . 
  one should never berate themselves for their feelings , especially by implying it 's something they have control over . 
  you ca n't control your feelings , only the way you react to them . 
  trying to control them is kind of like trying as hard as you can to not think of the pink elephat . 
  my theory is that anyone who tries to distill how to live life down to a single phrase , probably understands very little . 
  that 's understandable and fair enough . 
  i 'm definitely not saying you should cry at any moment you feel the slightest unhappiness , i was reacting to the vitriol in the way you described your inner voice . 
  sounds like you need to go see a doctor . 
  if you 're interested in doing something about it i can put you onto some resources . 
  my so prefers i only help non-naked women . 
  i know , right . 
  will that 's a lovely offer i have to decline for several reasons . 
  not least of which is that i 'm at work . 
  after a certain point , it 's more of a hindrance than a blessing to be big .

  stop going to / r/all , just go to reddit.com instead . 
  well there are two sides ; the physical and the psychological . 
  the physical is easy to understand . 
  if you 're chemically dependent on a subtance your body gets very unwell when it tries to go without out . 
  the psychological side is more complicated . 
  the first thing you need to understand is that the pattern of cognition or behaviour that put the addiction into place does n't instantly disappear .
