  no-one * chooses * to be addicted to something but there 's a reason they did . 
  beyond that , the behaviour is consistently reinforced ( if they were n't enjoying it , they would n't be doing it ) . 
  third , a lot of people with addictions spend all of their time with other addicts and quitting means giving up their social group . 
  what you wrote was fairly cogent . 
  the analogy that i like is from david eagleman who says to think of your conscious mind as the ceo of a huge company . 
  as the ceo you have the ability to ask departments what they 're doing ( attention ) and look back over reports ( memory ) etc. 
  but it 's not really possible for you to make every decision for every department all the time . 
  it would be too time prohibitive . 
  as the ceo , you spend your time making long-term plans and trying to assess overall efficacy of the company . 
  i can confirm that yes , you are spewing shit . 
  dreams are the result of random neural impulses that are interpreted by the few parts of your brain that are n't turned off during sleep . 
  there is little scientific or logical reason to believe that dreams have any predictive value . 
  if this is affecting your life you should go talk to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  there are many different therapeutic interventions for phobias ( most common is systematic desensitization ) and they 're very effective . 
  the 1800s called . . 
  because their target audience identifies with the themes and they 're able to put themselves in a role of dominance in all of those areas ( hottest women , biggest badass etc. ) . 
  it makes them appear to be an alpha male of the type of world that their audience is in/that they grew up in . 
  how does the placebo effect work ? 
  thanks, 
  i deny the premise . 
  why must there be a point ? 
  your question presupposed one . 
  it does n't presuppose * the * answer , it presupposes that * an * answer exists . 
  because there 's a significant difference between refusing medical treatment and asking someone to kill you even if they amount to the same thing . 
  what if the answer is derived by each personally individually and there 's no objective truth ? 
  dove in after my drowning cousin ( when i was a little kid myself ) and pulled him out of the water . 
  it 's human nature to compare yourself to the others around you ( heaps of cool studies on that ) but not productive . 
  unless the work she * is n't * doing is directly reflecting on you , you need to let it go . 
  if you spend your life worrying about what other people are doing/getting , you 'll drive yourself nuts . 
  marriage is a legal contract that provides certain protections under the law . 
  it 's not about it being illegal , it 's about fitting it within the current marriage rules .

  oh god how did this get here i am not good with computer, 
  i do n't think population control is ever ethical , nor do i think it 's inevitable that we 'll need it . 
  however , as you 've suggested there are forms of `` natural '' population control - access to birth control , education , gender equality etc. 
  it would be far easier and more ethical to work on those areas ( since they 're very valuable anyway ) while simultaneously investing large amounts into innovation . 
  man up and apologise . 
  irrespective of your beliefs , you know that was insensitive . 
  trait theorists tend to think that genetics/environment are about 50/50 for most traits based on twin studies . 
  the reason it becomes very complicated is, 
  a ) there is n't an ` introversion ' gene , it appears to be a complex interplay, 
  b ) reciprocal determinism - introverted people will enjoy activities that reinforce their introversion, 
  c ) parents will treat their kids in the way they expect them to behave . 
  a parent who sees their kid as extroverted will give them very outgoing activities . 
  d ) all of the above, 
  nice try , incredibly unimaginative police officer . 
  i am friendly and open to those around me . 
  fuck you for judging me .

  / r/firstworldproblems, 
  i did n't choose to become a professional internet commenter , it chose me . 
  it 's not sexist , it just shows that you do n't know many good female comedians . 
  there are plenty of others . 
  sure there are more top male comedians ( for all sorts of reasons ) but there are tonnes of funny women . 
  do what you think is right . 
  if you 're helping people , you 're helping people , stop judging yourself for it . 
  votes from the same ip will automatically get a downvote to go with it . 
  if you want to set up thousands of accounts from different ips that will all upvote it then go for it . 
  calf raises . 
  if you want to do them properly , put your toes on a step with your heels hanging off and slowly raise up and then down below the level of the step ( the slower and more controlled the better ) . 
  this sounds easy but it will make them much bigger and stronger . 
  i heard it and then made a second account to test and it worked .

  people tell me i 'm motivated and work hard , i do n't see myself that way . 
  i was always the fuck up in high school . 
  i skated by on my brains but never did any work . 
  i started university and was put on academic probation for failing subjects . 
  you know what happened next ? 
  i found what i ** really ** wanted to study . 
  i 've been averaging good enough marks to get me into the best postgrad program in my country since then . 
  find want you want to do and commit to it . 
  i promise you , the rest will fall into place . 
  i 'm not saying that it 'll be easy , i 'm saying that if you find what you want to do you wo n't care if it 's easy . 
  he 's the dirty little secret about people . 
  almost no-one is . 
  the only people who are , are the people who are strong enough to admit they do n't like being vulnerable . 
  it 's the human condition and you 're going to be okay . 
  have you spoken to , or have access to a psych ** ologist ** ? 
  what you 're going through right now is fixable but it * will * get worse if you do n't talk to someone . 
  you need help . 
  if you do n't have access to one , i can put you onto some resources that will help you in the short term . 
  it 's amazing how music can put you in touch with feelings that have been lurking deep inside . 
  i 'd be lying if i said i 'd never had to stop and cry when listening to a song . 
  thanks for your courage in sharing that . 
  / r/asksocialscience is great . 
  there 's always brilliant discussion on there but we need more questions . 
  do n't overthink it . 
  you 'll work it out in your own time . 
  just trust yourself . 
  because television is designed to be interesting whereas science is designed to be informative . 
  it 's kind of like asking why is delicious food more delicious than healthy food ? 
  or do n't post private shit . 
  obvious answer is obvious .
