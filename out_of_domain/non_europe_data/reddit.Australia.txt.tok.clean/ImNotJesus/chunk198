  odds are that i 'd be a servant of some description . 
   i 'm on the ground as we speak, 
  so you collapse , hit the ground and yell out `` help !, 
  pass my phone '' . 
  she passes you the phone . 
  `` reddit will * love this * '' . 
  i 'll start . 
  i was hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo ... 
  vaccines work . 
  study after study after study has shown it . 
  one study showed a link between vaccines and autism . 
  that study was retracted because the data was falsified and the guy who wrote it lost his licence . 
  there is no debate . 
  you did n't know that until you played sc2 ? 
  wow, 
  to answer your question though ; as a non-american i learned a lot of the states/capitals from playing nba live 97, 
  it 's not necessarily worth confronting but the scientific consensus is that corporal punishment is an ineffective parenting strategy that has many negative outcomes . 
  there was a large meta-analysis ( 80 something studies over 60 years ) done on it that found the only positive was `` immediate compliance '' but that it did not impact on long-term behaviour change and caused several relationship issues . 
  i personally would n't be against it being banned . 
  however , i know this is an unpopular opinion on reddit ( i get downvoted like crazy whenever i mention the scientific evidence ) . 
  actually , your brain does n't shut down . 
  studies have shown that you start using far more local processing than global processing ( you see the trees , not the forest ) and therefore think more analytically . 
  for example , what letter do you see ? 
  h h h h h h h, 
  if you were aroused , you 'd be statistically more likely to answer h than l. cool huh ? 
  [ link to an awesome book that talks about this study and lots of others ] ( http://www.simonlaham.com/books/science-sin ), 
  i normally do link to it . 
  i did n't bother because this post was about to disappear from downvotes . 
  here you go : [ link ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ), 
  [ as awesome as ted and you may not have heard of it ] ( http://thesciencenetwork.org/ ), 
  it was a very influential meta-analysis . 
  if the paper itself is too much/technical to read , there are lots of summaries out there . 
  no problems . 
  i recommend [ this ] ( http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate ) one but they 're all good . 
  watch the individual talks first , then the panel . 
  try [ this ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=transfer+music+from+ipod+to+computer+free ), 
  go to the people running the art show and tell them that they 're being used without your consent and are willing to sue if they do n't immediately take them down . 
  then , contact a lawyer . 
  mods do n't change what goes on the front page . 
  all we can do is remove posts and that is done very , very rarely ( besides spam posts ) . 
  if your posts are n't showing up in / new , they 're probably getting caught in the spam filter . 
  send us a [ message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit ) and we can fish it out for you . 
  the spam filter seems to be adaptive . 
  if you regularly post stuff that gets ignored i think it becomes more punitive over time . 
  as for your other comment , i can only do ones from this subreddit , you 'd need to message the til mods . 
  exactly . 
  if the gallery does n't take them down instantly i 'd be very surprised . 
  you 'd still have the right to sue , even if they do though . 
  not hard to show damages either considering it has already affected you . 
  if you 've never been grossed out , you 're not being inventive enough when searching, 
  is that really a thing ? 
  i see people talk about it on reddit but it 's never happened to me . 
  are you ashamed that you watch porn/masturbate ? 
  seems weird to me . 
  there are certain disease that you almost certainly do n't have if you 're not sexually active . 
  there 's no reason to ever lie to your doctor , i guarantee you they 've seen it all before and could n't care less about what you do in your private life aside from how it affects your case . 
  creepy, 
  creepy, 
  there was a large-scale survey not that long ago that a gay president was more likely as atheists are the most distrusted group in america . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www1.umn.edu/news/news-releases/2006/ur_release_mig_2816.html ), 
  correlation does n't equal causation . 
  i 'm a nice guy and doing well and there are plenty of others like me . 
  it 's not an excuse , do n't use it as one . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  arrogant guys are better at picking up slutty girls in bars . 
  if that 's what you want , go to / r/seduction with all the other creepy guys on there and learn to manipulate women . 
  if you actually want to win ( be happy in your life ) find a girl who likes you for who you are by just being yourself . 
  i know it sounds lame but it 's simply true . 
  if a girl is attracted to some asshole version of you , she 's not the girl you want to be with . 
  find a way of meeting girls that is geared towards nicer guys ( like online dating ) . 
  some do and you do n't want to be with them if that 's what they want anyway . 
  if they 're attracted to douchebags , they 're doing you a favour by not going out with you . 
  there are tonnes of girls out there who like nice guys . 
  i 'm marrying one soon . 
  how old are you ? 
  how old are you ? 
  how old are you ? 
   please do n't post poll-type questions . 
  please be aware this sub is not a substitute for real legal or medical help . 
  please seek professional attention or go to / r/medical if need be . 
  it 's not appropriate for this subreddit . 
  get rid of it you creepy asshole . 
  thank you kind sir, 
  also , almost every single psych experiment will note the gender differences . 
  hide their posts or remove them as a friend . 
  they can use facebook however they want . 
  they 're not being offensive , they 're just trying to express who they are . 
  aww thanks, 
  if it 's a scientific article it should reference the original paper that uses the scale . 
  use the reference to find the original authors of the scale and it will give you all the details . 
  because dinosaurs are n't real . 
  idiot, 
  `` always look on the bright side of life '', 
  ( admit it , you just did the doo doo d doo d doo in your head ), 
  edit : just to be clear , while i do see the humor with my username , this * is * a genuine answer . 
  porn player for the inside of my eyelids . 
  anorexia is a serious disorder and you need to be talking to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  it 's completely manageable but you need to seek out the support of an expert . 
  you need to get help . 
  i do n't want to be that guy but you * will * die if you do n't fix this .
