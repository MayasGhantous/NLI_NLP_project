  i do n't always upvote jokes about my username , but when i do , they 're life of brian references . 
  what have i done . 
  i already get at least 10 of `` nice try , jesus '' each day . 
  psychologist should always be the first stop unless it 's a particularly acute case . 
  a good psychologist will commence talk therapy and have their patient see a psychiatrist to receive medication ( if needed ) . 
  however , medication is n't a particularly appropriate option for anorexia ( it can be used but often is n't ) and talk therapy is far more efficacious . 
  i think that a small knowledge of psychology and neuroscience would tell you that there is n't such a thing . 
  however , a small knowledge of psychology and neuroscience would also tell you that free will is almost certainly also not a real thing . 
  what does matter though , is explicit intention . 
  there is a large functional difference between me breaking into your home and killing you and you jumping in front of my car and being killed . 
  my intention to do good or help people is functionally valuable to those around me , even if i get personal enjoyment out of it . 
  selfless acts are almost certainly illusory but that does n't make them any less valuable to the recipient or any more enjoyable for the giver . 
  ** fun fact ** : studies have shown that spending the same amount of money on ** someone else ** ( taking a friend out for lunch , giving charity etc. ), 
  will give you significantly more happiness than spending the same amount of money on yourself . 
  except making you feel like a good person for doing it . 
  actually , iq scores have been steadily rising since iq tests were invented ( it 's called the flynn effect ) . 
  it was rising at about 3 iq points per decade ( which is actually very significant ) but has started levelling off in western countries . 
  c ) this question, 
  no need to apologise at all , i love teaching people about this stuff . 
  the biggest difference is that psychiatrists get a medical degree and then specialise in psychiatric medicine whereas psychologists study psychology . 
  you 're right that many psychologists are just academics but the clinicians are far better trained in talk therapy than psychiatrists because that 's their primary focus . 
  however , while a psychologist will have knowledge of medications , they 're not trained to prescribe them so they 'll refer you to a psychiatrist ( or a doctor in some cases ) to receive and monitor the med use . 
  [ fixed ], 
  the mods can change that part . 
  you 're not missing anything . 
  it 's over very soon but thanks !, 
  i went to a jewish school so we learned about ww2 by doing nothing but talking about concentration camps . 
  i think i saw schindler 's list 5 separate times . 
  it sounds like you would get a lot of benefit from talking to a psych ** ologist ** as they can really help with this sort of thing . 
  in the meantime , you can practice mindfulness meditation ( amazing research results showing how effective it is ) just search for ucla mindfulness in itunes and try some of their guided meditations . 
  that song can make me want to cry at the best of times . 
  except that it 's consistently the top answer to this question when it gets to the front page 3 times a week . 
  just apologise . 
  you know you did the wrong thing . 
  `` i 'm sorry i said that , i did n't mean to hurt your feelings i was just in a shit mood . 
  there 's no excuse , i did the wrong thing and i 'm sorry '' . 
  easy . 
  done . 
  be the bigger person ( * snicker * ), 
  well , since we 're making up an imaginary world where timetravel is possible , why do n't you make up an imaginary outcome ? 
  did you try saying `` that 's what you do in alone time , not around other people '' ? 
  it 's not terrible and you should n't feel bad . 
  it 's a tricky situation . 
  if/when you say something , just make it about being something you do in private as opposed to it being an act you should be ashamed of . 
  you do n't want to shame him , just let him know you do n't do it in front of other people . 
  thank you sir , on both accounts . 
  i meant thanks for the correction ** and ** thanks for the happy cake day,

  `` i do not fear death . 
  i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born , and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it . '' - mark twain, 
  i deal with death by creating a meaningful life . 
  the way i think of it is this ; if we only have one life to live , one life to create meaning and enjoy love and happiness , it means that my life is infinitely more meaningful . 
  i deal with death by knowing that i 'll have lived my life to the fullest and left the world a better place because i existed . 
  i 'll know that i 'll have a legacy , in the family i raise and the people i help . 
  i 'll live on through them . 
  the evolutionary benefit is that it signals distress to those around you . 
  fluffer, 
  is delusions of grandeur a power ? 
  even if you thought he was bad for america ( ** highly ** debatable ) , surely you 'd think that bush got the ball rolling . 
  i 'll be sperm again ? 
  cool, 
  it 's not just you , it 's called nutrition . 
  masturbate while staring through my window . 
  creeps, 
  my girlfriend is intrigued by mine . 
  it 's not common but it 's not weird . 
  no we do not . 
  the narwal shit is unbearable enough . 
  here 's a good rule of thumb , if it would be a dealbreaker to tell that person , you 're probably doing the wrong thing . 
  you do n't owe her anything after a first date but do n't continuously date two women at the same time , it will end in someone getting hurt, 
  avocado head . 
  apparently my sister thought my head was avocado shaped . 
  the general rule for psychology experiments is you need a p value of < 0.05 which basically means that there 's less than a 5 % chance the found effects are the result of chance . 
  beyond that , effect size is also important . 
  there are tonnes of different types of tests that show effect size or the level of relationship between the variables that largely depend on the type of study being done but almost all use a p value of 0.05 ( and will report 0.01 if their report reaches that significance ) . 
  is there a particular type of study or an example you have ? 
  i could run you through the basics of how you 'd analyse it ( it 's good practice for me considering i 'm studying for a research methods i psychology subject as we speak ) . 
  that 's a pretty complicated question but there 's a great this american life podcast on the topic . 
  i 'd highly recommend it as a good summary . 
  my biggest recommendation is try to be as honest about yourself as possible ( without being over the top in divulging ) . 
  the idea is that you only want to attract the kind of people who would * actually * be interested in you . 
  i ca n't believe how many people i met who were nothing like their profile . 
  it 's just a waste of everyone 's time . 
  beyond that , usual safety stuff . 
  do n't give out personal information that you do n't need to . 
  do n't let them pick you up for the first date and meet them in a public place . 
  the only reason you 're crazy is that you 're dating a 7 year old . 
  it depends on the type of study you 're doing . 
  there 's basically two different types ; experimental and non-experimental ( i 'll leave out quasi-experimental but it 's basically halfway between the two ) . 
  in an experimental design , you 're doing everything you can to eliminate all confounding ( variables that you 're not trying to measure that will change the result ) variables . 
  it always involves a a manipulation , a control group and trying to eliminate outside variables . 
  for example , three groups come in for a quiz , theyr ' e randomly assigned to groups where one is told that the quiz is really easy , the other is told it 's really hard and the last group is told nothing ( control group ) . 
  you then measure the scores of different groups and compare them to see the effect of the independent variable ( how hard you told them the test was ) on the dependant variable ( test score ) . 
  in a non-experimental design , there are variables you ca n't control because it 's impossible or unethical . 
  for example , i want to see the effect of trait introversion on iq tests . 
  i get in all of my participants and give them a personality test to see their levels of introversion and then make them do an iq test ( see how there 's no manipulation ? ) . 
  all i do then is compare the scores of each person 's iq test and their personality test . 
  as you pointed out , there 's a lot i 'm not controlling for which is why experimental designs are always used when possible . 
  at best , i could say there 's a ** relationship ** between iq and trait introversion whereas in the first one i can show that the manipulation ** caused ** the effect ( assuming all my results reached statistical significance ) .
