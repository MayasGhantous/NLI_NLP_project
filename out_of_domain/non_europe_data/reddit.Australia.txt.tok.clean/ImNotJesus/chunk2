  if you 're doing cardio the most important thing , in my opinion , is just to make sure you 're enjoying yourself . 
  i always enjoyed doing interval training ( which means you do explosive/sprint exercises and then use slow jogging or walking as recovery time ) but i loved that feeling of wanting to collapse when i finish exercising . 
  ** that is not maintainable for everyone ** . 
  find something you enjoy and do it , it 's that simple . 
  as for diet , i could give you hundreds of tips and tricks but they really make very little difference at the end of the day . 
  the way i lost weight , keeping it simple . 
  i gave myself 2000 calories per meal ( 1500 if you 're a girl ) and did n't snack . 
  i know my body and if i maintain that i 'll lose about 1kg ( 2.2 lbs ) a week . 
  add exercise and it drops fast . 
  again , it has to be maintainable . 
  i started making myself a list of delicious meals i could make for 2000 calories and started to really enjoy losing weight . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you 're looking for so i explained with broad strokes but if you want more info just say so . 
  this is good advice , do n't over-complicate things , just get moving . 
  thanks . 
  it was the hardest but most rewarding thing i 've ever done . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ktuycokmgs1qzma4ho1_500.jpg ), 
  thanks , really appreciate it . 
  when i was depressed i think one of the hardest things was feeling like no-one besides my therapist could possibly understand , it 's a very lonely feeling . 
  if nothing else , i hope that some people read this and realise they 're not alone . 
  none !, 
  has he sought help ? 
  i 've been thinking about the question for the last 45 minutes and decided to come and post something pretty similar to this . 
  the ** biggest ** change has been the ability to take incremental steps towards a larger goal . 
  to explain ; in the past i had to work everything out in my head before i was able to do things . 
  now , i 'm able to trust myself to say `` okay , you want to be a psychologist one day , you may not feel like you 're ready now but you do n't have to be . 
  just go to this next class and deal with the one after that tomorrow . '', 
  i 'm sure i 'll come up with many other big changes so i 'll come and edit this post if i do, 
  thanks for the professional opinion . 
  lol dude , i do n't know what you 're problem is but that 's how the depression was described by my therapist , someone who knows me and is a professional in the field . 
  i do n't really understand where the vitriol is coming from , i made this thread to help people , if you do n't want it feel free to leave but i never did anything to you . 
  there are many different types of depression and they affect people in different ways . 
  i 'm not sure if you 've done much reading on depression but it 's a very broad spectrum . 
  also , at no point did i say that depression was trivial and have at no point tried to offer any advice to anyone suffering from depression themselves . 
  if anyone did ask i would tell them a bit about my experience then tell them to seek professional help . 
  i do n't really know why you 've made so many false conclusions about me but i 'm not here to impress anyone , i expected not to get a response in this thread at all and i 'm glad i did because some people have already responded well to it . 
  sorry if you think my depression was n't special enough to talk about it but that 's not really your call to make . 
  if people want to talk to me about it just let them . 
  hey hatsumi , before anything else i want to say that if this is happening regularly or impacting negatively on your life you should ** speak to a professional ** . 
  i 'm ** not ** qualified to help you in that way but am happy to talk from my own experience . 
  for me , it can be really hard to get out of bed some days . 
  even though i 'm now a happy person i still have days like that . 
  i think you hit the nail on the head though when you said :, 
   when life is n't treating you so well, 
  i used to often have a really bad few days and go see my therapist and say `` it 's not fair , i deserve a break '' or `` i 've been working so hard to get better i just need things to fall in place a little bit '' . 
  i think it 's a really natural , human response . 
  however , one day i realised that no-one cares what i deserve . 
  it was one of the scariest and most liberating realisations of my life . 
  it allowed me to go from being a victim of having , what felt like to me , some really shit luck to me taking more ownership . 
  i know it sounds trite and easy but when i 'm having one of those mornings where i really do n't want to get out of bed i just remind myself no-one actually cares if i do or do n't . 
  if i do n't go to all of my classes because i feel crap i still have to do the work , my responsibilities do n't disappear . 
  no amount of feeling sorry for myself fixes it and the quicker i deal with it , the easier it is . 
  i guess the moral of the story is that at the end of the day i try to remind myself that i ca n't control my emotions , i can only control what i do with them . 
  learn from your emotions , understand where they come from but the more you let them stop you from doing what makes you happy ( * really * happy not just instant gratification ) the easier it will be for them to stop you next time . 
  never a good idea to ask for medical advice on the internet . 
  if you 're worried about side effects go see your doctor , they 'll be able to answer far better than anyone on here . 
  i 'm really glad to hear that and it makes it all worthwhile . 
  i definitely agree that doing something positive makes you feel a lot lighter and you can really build on that momentum . 
  i think it 's really important to recognise not just what you do but the circumstances around it . 
  for example , you should feel proud of yourself for a day you feel great and get a lot done . 
  you should feel even ** more ** proud of yourself for a day where you feel crap and get more than you thought you could done . 
  i think giving that charity was also a really good idea , when i was really depressed i spent a few weeks volunteering and it has so many personal benefits . 
   i 'm not super depressed , but there are days where i feel like giving up and just escaping to that dream world i created . 
  i think everyone feels that way sometimes and it 's great that you can admit it . 
  if it 's ever interfering with your life or becoming very frequent it 's worth seeing someone though . 
  please know that when i recommend seeing a therapist that it is not at all a detrimental comment about you . 
  i think it 's something most people should do at one stage in their life and i also do n't want you to not seek treatment ( if you 're ever depressed ) because of anything i say . 
  however , if you ever want to feel better just speaking to someone please do n't hesitate to pm me , always happy to listen , 
  under 2000 calories a meal sorry , 2000 was my cap and i did n't eat snacks so i was consistently a little bit below 6000 . 
  if you 're a large male that should be low enough to lose weight on a consistent basis . 
  great question . 
  it can be really tough to know what to do as a friend of someone in that position . 
  my friend that helped me the most was probably the one who by look on my face knew to say `` sit down , i 'll grab you a beer , let me know what 's going on . '', 
  i think in general , just being there for me , listening and supporting me . 
  advice gets really annoying sometimes when you know what you need to change but are n't ready . 
  upvote for making me think of arrested development, 
  thanks . 
  it really depends on your definition of suicidal really . 
  i was never really at a point where i started planning it or genuinely wanted to go through with but there was a several month period where i thought life was n't worth living . 
  probably not suicidal but not that far off either . 
  i 've never heard of nosebleeds from upset but i 'm not an expert . 
  are you having a tough time dealing with your suicidal friend ? 
  haha thanks man . 
  wow for about a year then dota for about 2 . 
  yeh , it 's really tough but it sounds like you care a lot which is great . 
  i think the best thing you can do for her is make sure she knows that . 
  one of the hardest things about being depressed is that you feel really isolated and no-one understands . 
  just make sure she knows that you care about her no matter what happens . 
  i would guess that part of what she is doing is pushing people away to test if they care about her , i did the same . 
  just be there for her the best you can . 
  however , if she 's seriously suicidal make sure she gets help , i know you want to help her but once it becomes really serious she needs more than a good friend to rely on . 
  it 's a really scary situation but you should n't feel guilty . 
  sorry to hear that, 
  met her online dating . 
  as i was starting to get through the depression ( it can be pretty hard to define an end point but i was able to have a job at this point ) my therapist suggested online dating as a less scary way to meet girls . 
  i did and met my current partner ( also met my ex and had a bunch of dates , it was great practice ) . 
  ah that sucks . 
  with online dating you get lots of rejection so it 's good to develop a thick skin . 
  my logic was always to be really honest about who i am and what i 'm looking for ( without sounding like a creep ) and assuming anyone that was n't interested by that probably would n't last long with me . 
  sounds obvious but it helped . 
  shame i ca n't repost this to / r/octogenerians,
