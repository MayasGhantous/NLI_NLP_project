  i 'd like to believe that was an awesome horseshoe style throw, 
  [ ] ( / fap `` i really am fapping '' ), 
  i 've been basting it for hours, 
  it 's great for people who hate surprises . 
  that 's why i always use [ ] ( / schlick ) instead of [ ] ( / fap ) . 
  double the comment karma at least . 
  nobody puts baby in the corner, 
  * i wonder if most redditors are too young to get this reference, 
  [ ] ( / wayevil `` i really am jesus '' ), 
  i 'm 82 and what is this ? 
  [ ] ( / wayevil `` i have an iphone , block my porn now bitches '' ), 
  i got into situation with my ex where we would both open our eyes to check if the other had their eyes open . 
  the only problem was , if you opened your eyes to check and then they opened theirs a second later it looked like you were the one with your eyes open . 
  me and my best mate have a rule that we do n't call each other out on reddit reposts on fb or if we 're out and bring up topics we read about reddit . 
  i 'm 8 and what is this ? 
  she even wore her lucky earrings . 
  [ ] ( / wayevil `` it really did happen but you and harold camping did n't make the cut '' ), 
  plan on selling them ? 
  mouthwash is the minimum before any kissing can take place . 
  you better have handed that man a 50 before you walked off . 
  just gave you some . 
  damn and that guy who lived in his mother 's basement with you was probably such a winner too . 
  i ca n't imagine how you 'll do better . 
  i think that eating toast while typing affects your spelling, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmyyery11o ), 
  i 've never regretted watching a robin williams special, 
  this is the internet and that 's remarkably tame considering . 
  if this was a picture of recovering from cancer or something then sure , probably crossing the line . 
  she 's not immune from joking just because her husband is in the military . 
  that 's not a cake , it 's target practice . 
  samwise finally gets it over with and kisses frodo, 
  excuse me sir but i need some help with my stick shift , it may be a problem with the drive shaft . 
  cum that has been in hot water or steam is fucking impossible to clean and feels horrible on your skin ... or so i 've heard . 
  i have n't * read * a book in ages but i listen to about 2/3 non-fiction audiobooks a week, 
  how about : he imagined the entire thing to escape the regular child abuse, 
  if she hugs her brother like that you probably do n't want to be with her, 
  same rules for reddit posting, 
  a different bum was taking his wallet during the story, 
  i think it 's more simple than that , there are two categories :, 
  1 ) in the top 5-10 % of income and benefit from their policies, 
  2 ) are too stupid to realise that liberal policy will hurt them a lot more than other australians ( as seen by the sheer number of rural towns that voted lib during the government election that centred on the privatisation of telstra ) . 
  one ring to rule them all, 
   quote # 77519, 
   gravity is a theory , not a proven fact . 
   the effects of gravity can be explained by other theories . 
  an example would be the acceleration theory which asserts the earth is actually moving ` upward ' at a constant rate of 1g ( 9.8 m/sec ^ 2 ) . 
  this produces the same effect as `` gravity '' . 
   see there are different theories for the same phenomena - and none are facts , they are just theories, 
   quote # 77942, 
   wiccan should have their kids taken away . 
  anyone who is n't raising their children in a christian home should have their children taken away , it is mental , emotional and spiritual abuse . 
  period . 
  end of discussion . 
  case closed . 
  polarisation of the religious right into an untenable position where people are going to get hurt, 
  sending an sms to that i intended to send to my friend to my mother instead that said :, 
  `` it was great but it hurt to pee afterwards . '', 
  she replied by asking me if i needed to see a doctor . 
  most polite post removal ever, 
  `` oh fuck i 'm so sorry , that was intended for a friend . '', 
  does n't really help tbh . 
  to make it worse i 'd told her only the night before that i 'd been hooking up with a fuck buddy because she was starting to worry about where i was randomly going at night . 
  sometimes , on the internet , people say silly things to make other people laugh . 
  probably but i spend so much more time listening to them than i could spend reading ( ie. , while gaming , driving , doing house chores , at the gym etc. ), 
  what kind of cock sucking mother fucker would use sexually suggestive language on the internets ? 
  i read it as pedobearsbodyclock and spent way too longer wondering how pedophilia would affect one 's body clock . 
  1 ) [ post in subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/hpp1p/trusted_adult_does_reddits_lawyers_think_that_the/ ) with no success, 
  2 ) make into rage comic and post in f7u12, 
  i have 2 friends .

  i 'm really not exaggerating when i say that i 'm not jesus !, 
  true story . 
  so it was steam invitation issues that caused me to not get invited to the prom ? 
  i knew it !, 
  agreed . 
  this is pretty mildly messy and would assume that most of what you get is far worse . 
  excuse me sir but 4chan is [ this ] ( http://4chan.org/b/ ) way, 
  impossible . 
  no-one would think the perfect race were gingers . 
  ftfy, 
  but what if you prefer free-range children ? 
  dude , smell my finger, 
  than . 
  you 're welcome, 
  do you bite your thumb at us , sir ? 
  to be fair , it seemed like the best way to get the cat down . 
  god i want to be there when he rips it off . 
  til that not all people on the internet do sufficient research before they make claims . 
  i paused my uni lecture to read the comic . 
   ... and then i got fired for masturbating in the office . 
  the end . 
  it 's really not a deal-breaker for me . 
  i realise this but i mean it more in a `` i 'll do anything for that a '' kind of way . 
  the same thing happened to me a few years ago when i turned on the tv and instantly heard : `` if you 've just tuned in , princess diana is dead . '', 
  i was on a bus during a bachelor party once and i was really carsick so i decided to listen to my ipod to try and distract myself . 
  guy across from me asked what i was listening to and for some reason he thought it was weird that while drunk and at a bachelor party i was listening to an audiobook about neuroplasticity . 
  double delta 32 is what causes the immunity ( there 's an article on reddit about a guy being cured from aids so i just read it ), 
  excuse me sir but you seem to have dropped [ this ] ( http://www.popsci.com/files/imagecache/article_image_large/articles/sarcasm01.jpg ), 
  same story but i assume different article since it 's dated may 29th .
