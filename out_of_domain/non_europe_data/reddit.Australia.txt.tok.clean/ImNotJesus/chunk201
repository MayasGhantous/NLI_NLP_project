  works wonders . 
   \u25e6 daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  significant other, 
  sure . 
  lots of people of people see them when they 're younger than that . 
  psychologists are n't just for sick people , sometimes they 're really helpful in getting your life to where you want it to be . 
  many can, 
  the user has now been banned . 
  there 's zero tolerance for this sort of thing . 
  this is n't a question and therefore not appropriate for this subreddit, 
  boiling it will kill most bacteria . 
  boiling water with a dump in it will do nothing . 
  / r/shamelessplug or maybe / r/misc . 
  / r/politics would probably be interested too, 
  no stress at all, 
  `` he ruined me for other men by giving me impossibly high standards in bed . 
  ama '', 
  almost exactly the same . 
  while i admire what you 're doing this is n't the appropriate subreddit . 
  try / r/shamelessplugs or / r/misc, 
  spam police . 
  `` what are you doing outsie my window ? '', 
  ahh cindy , you 're so adorable . 
  a whole bunch were just added . 
  the main reason is that being really warm creates an uncomfortable living environment for the invading bugs . 
  new research also suggests that being really warm causes your body to create more t-cells ( the things that fight infection ) so being cold is your body 's way of trying to encourage you to get really warm, 
  thank you sir . 
  yeh , not sure why but someone should really take it down . 
  if i knew anything about css or even what it stood for i 'd fix it myself . 
  plenty of room in the back . 
  i fit inside really easily . 
  i love letting my friends have a drive . 
  it seems to be letting off some fumes . 
  it makes a funny noise when i drive it . 
  i got it second hand . 
  * yeeesh * could do with a bit of a clean . 
  i might swap it in for a newer model . 
  i bought it from an old russian guy . 
  agreed . 
  `` hi , i 'm imnotjesus , nice to meet you . '', 
  works 60 % of the time , everytime . 
  if you 're having panic attacks you need to speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  they 're treatable and there 's no need for you to ever get another one . 
  make another account for that purpose . 
  / r/asksocialscience is really good . 
  there are also lots of science subreddits ( i 'm subscribed to / r/psychology / r/academicpsychology / r/cogsci / r/neuro etc. ), 
  want me to ban you from / r/askreddit ? 
  sounds like you could get value out of speaking to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  this should be done with the supervision of a psychologist for several reasons though . 
  why is that ? 
  it 's understandable that you 're scard . 
  the first thing you need to realise though is that seeing someone will * reduce * your stress , not increase it . 
  of course , there will be times when you 're pushed to make youself vulnerable which can be tricky but it should n't ever be faster than you feel capable . 
  the thing that most people do n't realise about therapy is that you 're in ** complete control ** . 
  you tell them what you want and how fast you want to go and they guide you by teaching you how to have that . 
  no problems at all , feel free to pm me if necessary, 
  i do n't think there 's some balance sheet that makes sure everything is even , i do n't think there needs to be . 
  recent studies have actually shown that you get more pleasure from giving money to someone else than you do spending the same amount on yourself . 
  we 're hardwired to be a part of a community and want for the greater good . 
  if more people realised that , we 'd be much better off and i think that a desire for an external authority ( god , karma etc. ), 
  distracts from the genuine pleasure of helping others . 
  you 've probably heard of cognitive dissonance before . 
  the first really big experimental study on it stands as one of the most fascinating ever done . 
  ( very very short version ) what they did was get a bunch of participants to do an incredibly boring task for 30 minutes , then , as they were leaving , they were told that the research assistant was held up and they needed to introduce the next person to the task and tell them it was really fun ( lying ) . 
  after they did this , they were paid for their participation and asked to rate how much they enjoyed the task itself . 
  here 's where it gets crazy ; the manipulation was how much they got paid . 
  it turned out , the people who got paid ** less ** reported enjoying the task ** more ** . 
  the reason is that when you do a task for money , you 've already got an in-built justification , it makes sense in your brain that you 're doing it for the money . 
  when you 're not doing it for the money , you need to know why , it needs to be worth it . 
  those people were forced to change their perception or re-evaluate their priorities . 
  people who do good things because of a higher power ( god/karma/whatever ) do n't need to do it because it feels good to help other people , they 've already got their justification ( of course that does n't mean that everyone who helps people because of a god does n't enjoy it ) . 
  you 're much , much better off trying to get a few hours sleep . 
  it sounds like you need to bite the bullet and go speak to a professional . 
  when mental illnesses are untreated they get worse , please do n't delay this any longer . 
  not necessarily . 
  edit : to be clear , schizophrenia is n't the only psychopathology to have auditory hallucinations . 
  it could also be psychosis as a result of untreated depression or a bunch of other things . 
  trying to diagnose disorders you do n't understand is dangerous . 
  you 'll feel worse immediately but you wo n't accumulate as much sleep debt and will therefore make it easier to get back on a good schedule . 
  go to sleep, 
  either way , you need to go speak to either a psychologist or a psychiatrist . 
  it 's not possibly . 
  you have a mental health disorder and if you do n't seek help it will get worse . 
  i know you do n't want to but you need to . 
  in case anyone is wondering , schizoid personality disorder is completely different from schizophrenia . 
  [ schizoid personality disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schizoid_personality_disorder ) is pervasive personality disorder that is characterised by complete disinterest in social ties . 
  schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterised by delusions , hallucinations and many other symptoms . 
  no problems at all !, 
  i promise that if you write psychologically accurate things i 'll upvote it though . 
  just quickly google a fact and i 'll upvote you . 
  for science !,
