  we love it . 
  costs a bucketload but worth every cent . 
  this is askreddit not your facebook page . 
  what 's the question ? 
  yes , many schizophrenics do . 
  you may want to consider getting reviewed by a psychiatrist . 
  sorry but choirs are related to churches and your comment is discriminatory, 
  i want to fly like an eagle, 
  plus it totally exposed [ homeopathy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbakze622kg ) years ago,

  no-one is forcing you to look at / r/atheism and the rest is n't bad . 
  steal this one from jimmy carr :, 
  `` i 'd give you my comeback but first you 'll have to clean it of your mother 's teeth '', 
  australia is like america but you can get a job that pays you enough and get healthcare , almost free education ( that you do n't have to pay until you earn enough ) and much less crime . 
  basically , we rock . 
  no one cares about your age , all they care about is the content you add . 
  do n't stress about it . 
  none of them . 
  especially the ones that just do the thing it says in their name . 
  in a related note , commenting on the usernames of people who post a lot ( like potato_in_my_anus ) is ** not ** funny . 
  if you 're having panic attacks you should be talking to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  fapping should n't make your panic attacks better or worse , it 's unrelated .

  a restraining order .

  mindfulness meditation . 
  it 's had incredible results recently in scientific studies on stress/anxiety/depression . 
  i do n't have a tan,

  wow that 's horrifying to watch, 
  and the winner of `` creepiest thread of the day '' is ... 
  * drum roll *, 
  ** goingsteady **, 
  please accept this golden tissue award . 
  i do n't always make huge life changes , but when i do it 's because people on the internet told me to . 
  `` the media often portray people with schizophrenia as believing they are famous or important people ( such as napoleon or jesus christ ) , although this is only one type of delusion . '', 
  - my psychopathology textbook, 
  there are lots of different types of delusions . 
  persecution delusions , capgras syndrome and even completely bizarre ones . 
  the point is , delusions come in most shapes and sizes so it 's probably just that you notice it more because ( a ) it 's portrayed in the media that way and ( b ) you notice those ones because it resonates with you, 
  i do n't always pretend i know things about complex mental illnesses , but when i do it 's anonymously and on the internet . 
  this is a masterpiece of creepiness . 
  it deserves an award . 
  i got called `` arrogant '' by a naturopath a couple of days ago because i said it was n't appropriate for him to try and provide counselling to his customers . 
  note : i did n't randomly attack him . 
  we were having a discussion about the validity of alternative medicine ( protip : there is none ), 
  because even 10 years ago it was nowhere near as safe or accepted to come out as gay . 
  there are many more in the closet too . 
  they 're are n't more gay people . 
  no i would not . 
  you may get a lot of value out of speaking to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  a lot of people overeat for different reasons . 
  you should find out why you do . 
  dr. oz is a fucking quack . 
  if you did n't have something staring you in the face that you could n't notice , you would n't be human . 
  placebo effect . 
  there are huge gaps in the research . 
  alternatively , something building on sam harris ' research into the difference in neural activation in recalling beliefs and facts .

  what are you doing on reddit ? 
  feeling sorry for yourself instead of doing something about it makes you the worst kind of boyfriend . 
  man the fuck up . 
  survival of the not retarded ? 
  i say that as a joke but really it 's not just assholes that get it , it 's the immuno-compromised . 
  fuck i hate people that do n't vaccinate . 
  that 's the idea yeah . 
  they were basically trying to find out whether say a belief that jesus was the son of god was encoded the same way as saying the capital of the us is washington d.c, 
  for context , this was while i had never kissed a girl and was suffering from clinical depression :, 
  i was having this dream that involved me getting to know a girl . 
  after a while , we got to the point where we were about to kiss . 
  i can still ( so many years later ) vividly remember the sensation . 
  i was about to kiss her and could feel this incredible warmth coming from her mouth . 
  as our lips touched i woke up and could still feel that warmth . 
  i almost started crying , just because of how intense losing that feeling was . 
  that 's not useless . 
  it 's awesome . 
  my first kiss sucked and she was crazy ( long story involving cutting - woohoo ) . 
  all good now though . 
  i live with a fantastic woman and she 's wonderful to kiss . 
  i still find it really bizarre that tips are expected in america . 
  in australia , servers are paid well enough that they do n't rely on tips . 
  this means that ( a ) you can actually reward good service ( i always do ) and ( b ) assholes ca n't stiff hard working people . 
  it just seems like a really bad system . 
  carrots . 
  apples . 
  all delicious , all healthy . 
  no , it should n't be because there 's not a sufficient mechanism to make sure the article is accurate . 
  you can always use it as a starting point because it will link to proper articles . 
  i do n't understand why anyone would want this . 
  i do n't often think `` hmm i like public bathrooms but i wish they smelled worse and had more bacteria floating around '', 
  sounds like you 'd get benefit from talking about these feelings with a psych ** ologist ** . 
   i 'm sick of being a depressed piece of shit all the time . 
  forgive me for thinking that you may suffer from depression . 
  ( assuming you 're from america ), 
  birth control procedures should be paid for by the government because the government should be helping people afford medical procedures . 
  it 's so absurd that there needs to be a reason for the government to provide healthcare beyond the fact that ** everyone ** should have access to it .
