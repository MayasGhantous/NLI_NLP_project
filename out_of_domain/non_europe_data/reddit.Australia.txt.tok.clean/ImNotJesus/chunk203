  america is fucking weird man . 
  he 's suggesting that stopping unplanned pregnancy is a way of getting people off welfare . 
  it 's probably accurate but i have no evidence to suggest it . 
  to make a link you need the http : / /, 
  also , if you 're linking to a subreddit , just doing / r/link will work, 
  i read that last sentence 4 times before it said cook, 
  1on1 tmnt win no problems . 
  once the power rangers morph and shit tmnt are fucked . 
  just doin ' my job, 
  run, 
  is that a euphemism ? 
  wow ... you break up with a guy and berate him for not taking it properly . 
  i got laid from playing tap tap revolution on my phone once . 
  by getting new friends . 
  i sleep naked . 
  the 1/100 times i wake up with my girlfriend touching my cock makes it worth it . 
  ouch . 
  that 's pretty impressively needy right there . 
  not much to tell . 
  showed my girlfriend ( still a very new gf at the time ) me playing tap tap . 
  she said `` wow you 're good with your fingers '' . 
  using my fingers came next . . 
  i make way too many comments to find it but my top is actually :, 
  i think it 's fairly unclear whether or not he actually existed but if he did it seems like his morals were somewhat ahead of the average at the time . 
  i see no reason to believe he performed any miracles . 
  you 're also forgetting that lack of healthcare means people miss time or lose jobs , not to mention that a large proportion of people with no jobs have mental health issues . 
  i think that universal healthcare would actually be a benefit to the economy , let alone the morally right thing to do . 
  you job is to support her , not fix her . 
  you let her talk ( if she wants to ) and you let her get upset about it ( if she wants to ) . 
  if she actively wants to move on from the hurt , you can always suggest talking to a psych ** ologist ** but do so very carefully . 
  at the end of the day , what she wants most from you is to feel safe ( even women who were n't raped need this ) . 
  ask him if , given that he believes marriage should follow a strict and unchanging definition , we should disallow african americans to marry white people as changing the law was inappropriate . 
  this was the worst idea in the world yesterday and it still is today . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/rh715/i_have_the_best_most_fantabulous_idea_for_a/ ), 
  so you 're * for * stoning disobedient kids ? 
  you said you wanted people to follow the bible but also agree that large parts of it are pretty despicable . 
  i do n't understand . 
  kind of . 
  scholarly articles are generally designed to notice keywords . 
  so you have to think of the list of 7/8 words the person writing the article you want would use to describe their article . 
  protip : if there is a word that can be in a few different forms and you 'd want any ( for example , depression/depressive etc. ), 
  try depress * and it will give you any alternative that starts with those letters . 
  not at all, 
  because it 's illegal to practise as a psychologist without doing it first . 
  my friend asked me why i believed in god . 
  a month later i was an atheist . 
  i think until that point i 'd never actually considered it a choice i could make . 
  while it 's a great cause this is n't the correct subreddit for this . 
  sorry but i have to remove the post . 
  sounds like he needs professional help, 
  / r/assistance / r/misc / r/favors, 
  always look on the bright side of life, 
  i 'm tired of sifting through juvenile complaints about other people 's posts . 
  provide better content and downvote the stuff you do n't like . 
  i know in the month you 've been here you really earned that 65 link karma but have you considered that maybe people upvote the content that they * want * to see ? 
  i hate people who do n't have the tastes as me . 
  all of them . 
  and what would the internet be without angry people making themselves feel better by criticising others ? 
  of course it 's possible . 
  there is n't such magical mechanism in our brain called ` love ' that only works for one person at a time . 
  there are all sorts of different kinds of love and attraction . 
  most people feel that a big part of expressing their love is exclusivity . 
  that does n't mean that your brain is n't capable of feeling attraction or closeness anymore . 
  i give blood every 3 months ( it 's as often as they 'll allow you here ) . 
  it 's pretty incredible that my body can produce something that can heal others . 
  giving something when you really lose nothing is incredible . 
  doing it and saving lives is beyond anything else . 
  have n't had cancer myself but some family members who have . 
  do n't have anything valuable to add i just want to wish you all the best . 
  i hope you do n't feel to need to protect your family at this time . 
  you need to tell people you 're scared and hurting so they can help you . 
  i promise that they want to . 
  also , do n't be afraid to speak to a psych ** ologist ** about some of these fears . 
  there 's no shame in saying you 're scared . 
  keep your pants on, 
  prolactin and oxytocin . 
  i editted out serotonin because i fact-checked myself and it does n't seem to be majorly responsible for it . 
  oxytocin is relevant because it 's associated with a lot of the love/bonding feelings associated with orgasm and therefore i considered it relevant to the enjoyment . 
  as someone who loves spreading science i 'm always keen to answer, 
  if it defied the laws of science , the laws of science ( as we understood them ) would be wrong . 
  there is no evidence of a suspension of the laws of science ever occurring . 
  none because creepy, 
  you 're unlikely to get brain damage unless you 're oxygen deprived for a while or take a significant blow . 
  if he held it any longer after you passed out , you can do ** very serious ** damage though . 
  if you do n't know what you 're doing , do n't mess around . 
  alcohol and what it gets turned into by your liver is a poison . 
  reddit does n't listen to any music . 
  it 's a website . 
  idiot . 
  do n't let [ my so 's name ] see you look, 
  do n't let [ my so 's name ] see you look, 
  do n't let [ my so 's name ] see you look, 
  i really do wish global warming was a myth . 
  it would be great for all of us ( besides what it would do to the scientific community ) . 
  you need to report this therapist . 
  an `` expert '' told me that using suction cups on my back that are heated with a small wick at the top would help cleanse my system . 
  he then lit my back hair on fire accidentally . 
  1 ) in what context did you find out about this ? 
  it seems horribly innappropriate for you to know, 
  2 ) how do you ** know ** that he 's telling the truth ?
