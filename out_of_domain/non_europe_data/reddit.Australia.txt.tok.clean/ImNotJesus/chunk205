  text only, 
  yet it happens constantly, 
  no facebook links . 
  the two main iq tests are the wais and the stanford-binet , both of which need a professional psychologist to administer ( you need to be registered to even purchase it ) . 
  because the person did n't consent to having that information spread . 
  asking for personal information is the same thing . 
  i do n't really see any context where it would be necessary but if it 's incredibly important to post personal information you can always message the mods and we can discuss it . 
  it 's a regular issue . 
  go for it . 
  this is just / askreddit, 
  do n't forget to block out personal information !, 
  just doin ' my job , just doin ' my job . 
  * tips hat *, 
  and how do we know it 's actually yours and not a friend of yours that you 're playing a prank on ? 
  the problem is that we have no way of verifying ( practically ) that you are who you 're claiming to be . 
  i 'm not going to go through everyone 's post history . 
  i ca n't control what people do in other subreddits but it * is * against reddit 's rules, 
  fixed . 
  thanks, 
  i have no control over other parts of reddit . 
  i have no control over other parts of reddit, 
  i can make a choice whether my post shows me as a moderator . 
  i started doing it in this thread but stopped bothering because i 've written well over 100 replies today . 
  i 'm a very optimistic person . 
  even if you assume that a huge proportion are wonderful people , with 1.5 million users of the subreddit it 's still an unnacceptable number of assholes to risk it . 
  look on the right , about half way down the page, 
  it 's not pathetic , chill out . 
  you probably should n't let everyone know that sillybilly, 
  this is for / r/askreddit only . 
  i 'm not an admin . 
  that 's because we actively remove the posts, 
  yes . 
  i have n't changed any rules , i 'm making sure everyone knows them, 
  ... why did you get married ? 
  did you expect something to magically change ? 
  it really depends on the context/subreddit, 
  i 've filled out my form and will hand it in next time i go give blood ( about a month ) . 
  no helpful input , just that i 'm excited too . 
  ask the mods, 
  yup, 
  i read a while ago that if you put your pin in backwards it will still let you take out the money but also call the cops . 
  it 's almost certainly not true though because it was in a chain e-mail . 
  april fools ? 
  we all know that once you 're in as deep as us there 's no leaving . 
  people who complain about the `` friendzone '' have little to no idea about adult relationships . 
  sell 500 $ 1 handjobs . 
  you could be a five hundredaire by next weekend !, 
  you need to speak to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  suicidal ideation is a very big warning sign and you need to seek some support . 
  not all people with depression take anti-depressants but it can be very helpful in stabilising mood . 
  however , they should n't be taken without ongoing support . 
  your college will probably have some sort of counselling service that is either free or almost free . 
  if you have to means to see a private therapist , you should do so . 
  in the meantime ;, 
  1 ) get exercise ( walks are fantastic ), 
  2 ) regular meals/sleep habits, 
  3 ) start meditating ( go to itunes and search for ucla mindfulness ) . 
  it has been shown in study after study to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms . 
  this is askreddit , not iama, 
  a good counsellor wo n't do that . 
  it depends on the type of psychology but the basic idea is that they give you the tools to make a happier life for yourself by getting rid of maladaptive coping and thought patterns . 
  this is done in different ways by different types of therapy but real therapy is about giving you the freedom you need to make ** yourself ** happy . 
  because ` merica, 
  / r/doesanybodyelse, 
  increased/decreased masturbation is not a recognised symptom of depression . 
  go see a psych ** ologist ** and get therapy . 
  even if you 're not clinically depressed , ( s ) he can help you with your motivation . 
  are you asking us what size household item to suggest to your 12 year old sister to masturbate with ? 
  if you do n't know what you 've taken , you can always call an ambulance to be safe . 
  tomorrow , irrespective of how you feel , call the police and have that asshole put away . 
  i would , closely followed by the police . 
  i 'm out the other side of a 5 year depression . 
  i do n't know whether it 's post hoc rationalisation but i do think that i could n't be anywhere near as strong as i am today without having gone through that process . 
  it 's as if i was so broken , i needed to break down every part of myself but in doing that , i got to rebuild myself into the person i wanted to be . 
  my life is by no means perfect but i 'm 100x happier than i was before my depression . 
  this is n't a place for free marketing . 
  pima had sent an excessive number of messages to the mods . 
  we 'd asked him repeatedly to stop . 
  he was n't temporarily banned for asking for help , he was temporarily banned for being told over and over to drop the issue but continuing to send dozens of messages . 
  while i feel sympathy for his position , he was incredibly abusive to other mods and at some point we 're allowed to say that we do n't want to deal with it . 
  we 're volunteers , doing the best job we can to run the subreddit and we do n't need to take persistent abuse from someone who did n't get their way , irrespective of how fair the decision was . 
  edit : to those of you downvoting me ; that 's not really the purpose of a downvote . 
  if you disagree with me , tell me so . 
  downvoting me does nothing but hide what actually happened from those who want to see the story . 
  i think andrew is trying to take the higher ground and not post pages of screenshots of him abusing mods as a result of not getting his way . 
  because large proportions of your brain ( many of which adhere to reality principles ) are inactive . 
  we 're not teachers and you 're not students , it 's an unfair analogy . 
  we constantly get abused for enforcing too many of the rules . 
  no matter how much control we decide to exert , people are going to be pissed off . 
  i have no interest in brainwashing anyone . 
  however , i 'm not going to post things he said to us as he had a reasonable expectation of privacy when doing so . 
  if you do n't believe me that 's your prerogative , i 'm not here trying to convince anyone , just let you all know what happened . 
  because both parties had a reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  it 's not fair or appropriate and no-one here has a duty to clear it up to those watching the drama unfold . 
  this is n't a productive way to handle the incident . 
  okay, 
  thanks . 
  a few words of kindness are nice amid a shitstorm of anger . 
  what do you mean , sorry ? 
  the fact that you think it 's about `` reminding '' her and not addressing her concerns is a big clue into why you 're having these problems .
