  i 'm sure she 's told you the stuff she has n't been happy about over the last 2 years but it sounds like you have n't listened , at all . 
  have a really hard think about what she wants and whether , if you were unhappy with things , you 'd want someone telling you `` no babe , remember , you really like being together '', 
  reddit is a website , not a person with opinions . 
  there are millions of subscribers to said website who all have different views and thoughts . 
  your lack of a comma makes me confused whether he 's a cuntbag or i am . 
  either way , hi buddy . 
  i think they 'll be surprised that someone as openly crazy as rick santorum became president, 
  hmm i guess both work . 
  after reading like 50 abusive messages from that pima thread i 'm primed to read things a certain way ,, 
  that does look delicious . 
  nah i do n't actually care , i 'm just used to copping it now . 
  i get abused for everything because when you have 1.5 million subscribers , anything you do will piss off at least 200,000 of them and they think not just that they 're right but you 're the worst person in the world for having a different opinion, 
  here 's a very simple formula :, 
  1 ) ask an open-ended question ( can be anything , even as simple as `` what are you up to this weekend '' ), 
  2 ) listen to the answer, 
  3 ) find something that is other novel for you or you can relate to ( either extreme , there will always be one ) . 
  4a ) if novel , respond with `` oh really , i have n't tried/experienced/other that thing , what 's it like ? '', 
  4b ) if relateable `` oh really , i love/hate/masturbate to that , have you been doing it for long ? '', 
  return to stage 2 . 
  i would n't want to anyway . 
  i do n't really mind if people get annoyed at me , it 's just a weird experience to have an inbox full of vitriol when i 'm used to my responses being quite positively received . 
  honours psych student here and i 've never heard of anything like that . 
  i would strongly suggest getting her to see an expert . 
  edit : as pointed out by someone else , it is a * form * of dissociation ( which basically means losing your grip on reality ) . 
  why i said i have n't heard of anything like that is i 'm pretty sure that memory loss is atypical when dissociating unless it 's dissociative identity disorder or dissociative fugue ( neither of which fit ) . 
  irrespective of the exact diagnosis ( any diagnosis based on your assessment of her symptoms would be incredibly inappropriate ) if she 's having severe symptoms she needs to be under the care of a professional . 
  edit 2 : to be clear , honours psychology is what you do after you finish a bachelors degree and before a post-graduate degree in australia . 
  i 'm not talking about my marks . 
  offing yourself is certainly not helpful to your kids . 
  suck it up . 
  you 're a fucking father . 
  you made a mistake , you 're still paying for it . 
  fair or not , your life means something because you 're a dad . 
  my dad 's sack, 
  just an fyi : excess fat hauled on american tummies , hips , & butts would sustain caloric needs of afghanistan people for a year - neil degrasse tyson, 
  why ? 
  black light in the room ? 
  what do you base that question on ? 
  also , what source do you have that says rocking back and forth indicates childhood neglect ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  maybe there 's a communication gap . 
  honours psychology is the year you do after you finish your bachelors degree , before your post-grad work . 
  i 'm not talking about my marks . 
  oh , haha , thanks !, 
  i love teaching people about psychology so i get genuine enjoyment out of talking about it on reddit . 
  while it can be helpful to talk to her about it , it is n't a substitute for proper care and ** you should n't pressure her to talk if she 's not comfortable ** . 
  that 's what was happening . 
  i did n't post this huge thread . 
  when it was posted , i felt it appropriate to give a rough outline of what happened so there was n't any confusion . 
  if you 're suffering from depression you need to seek professional help as you would for any health issue . 
  other than that , exercise , good eating habits , good sleep habits and meditation have all been shown to reduce depressive symptoms . 
  as a mod i * should * say that this is n't what the subreddit is for . 
  as someone who thinks this is hilarious , i 'll just upvote you . 
  shit . 
  i 'm so close to being able to cash my karma in for a nice reddit sweater, 
  propose to megan fox, 
  suggestion 1 ) ask less vague questions . 
  is it a holiday ? 
  are you going to live there ? 
  what sort of suggestions do you want ? 
  what 's your budget ? 
  you should ** never ** think of yourself as too shy to go to therapy . 
  the entire point of therapy ( assuming your therapist is n't horrible at their job ) is that ** you ** are in charge . 
  you get to decide what you talk about and when . 
  you never have to go deeper or faster than you want to go . 
  if you 're genuinely suicidal , i ca n't emphasise enough how strongly i recommend you seek help . 
  you do n't need to feel like this and the help is out there . 
  not going is like having a serious illness but not wanting to tell your doctor because you 're too shy . 
  edit : if you 're willing to speak to a psychologist , there are many different types of therapy and some are probably easier on a shy person than others . 
  for example , mbsr ( mindfulness-based stress reduction ) is going to involve mainly meditation early on and there 's little need to open up for a while . 
  conversely , a cbt therapist is going to want you to identify the thought patterns that are causing your upset and will try and teach you to challenge them . 
  they 're both very effective types of therapy ( there are plenty of others too and i 'm happy to go through some options with you if you like ) and no good therapist will push you faster than you want to go . 
  wil wheaton probably . 
  i know chris hardwick is on a bit here and there . 
  not a question, 
  i assume a combination of nature and nurture is what caused him to be such a giant tool . 
  definitely and for just $ 19.95 i 'll tell you exactly how !, 
  this . 
  plus , the whole point of organic labels is that you can charge a lot more and idiots will pay it . 
  in australia , you have to pay a huge fee to become a certified organic company and then pay a percentage of your profits . 
  it 's a huge , huge money-making scheme . 
  you were rubbing your genitals against each other with no clothes on and ejaculated ? 
  yes , there 's a chance . 
  thank you kindly to you and the others that reported it . 
  the user was banned . 
  they have a son . 
  being spiteful may be funny and momentarily satisfying but it is n't the right thing to do in this case . 
  i know it 's tempting but he needs to be the bigger person . 
  puny mortal, 
  i have a job where i reddit for about 80 % of my day, 
  i 've never been in such a hurry that the second it takes to button is n't worth the 0.1 % chance of getting a zipper issue . 
  my manager probably think i have the worst case of ibs in the world . 
  sex is n't one thing . 
  it 's many different things to many different people at many different times . 
  sex can be slow and emotional . 
  it can be hot and heavy . 
  it can be boring . 
  it can be painful . 
  it can be empty and meaningless but crazy fun . 
  it can be incredibly anxiety-provoking .
