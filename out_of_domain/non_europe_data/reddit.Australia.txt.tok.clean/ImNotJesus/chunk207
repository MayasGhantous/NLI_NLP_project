  rubbing genitals together feels nice , sex is much , much more than that . 
  what i did n't realise when i was still relatively new to sex was that when i found someone that i loved , i would n't want to trade sex with them for anyone in the world . 
  same here buddy . 
  doing a masters and a phd and will be a student until i 'm 31 even though i 'll be married and have a kid before i finish . 
  they 're much much worse . 
  abortion is killing a small cluster of cells . 
  in fact , early-stage abortion kills less cells than scratching your nose . 
  dead-beat dads are hurting a real person that actually exists . 
  and if you do n't , you should be absolved of all responsibility if you say you do n't want the responsibility ? 
  it 's very difficult to detain a mental health patient . 
  there are a lot of rules about their potential for harm to themselves and others and there are very specific rules about follow-ups , challenges etc. 
  as for freedom in general , i think that ( as an australian ) americans sacralise ( i do n't know if it 's a real word but haidt uses it in his moral psychology papers so i 'm stealing it ) freedom * way * too much . 
  i recently had a relative visit from america who became absolutely irate when we were stopped for a random breath test . 
  in australia we have what are called `` booze buses '' which are basically just a group of police sitting in a popular road breathalising everyone that drives past . 
  she was livid that we had `` done nothing wrong '' but were still having our rights taken away . 
  from our perspective this was bizarre . 
  we have a very ** clearly ** life-saving activity and she was far more upset about losing 2 minutes of her time . 
  my impression of america ( and you can correct me if you think necessary ) is that freedom has become the ultimate buzzword . 
  it 's this bizarre fetishisation of the `` american dream '' where anyone can make it if they have the freedom . 
  what it leads to though is fear of `` socialised medicine '' and anger towards police that are trying to keep you safe ( yes i know some cops are bad ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** freedom is important , america thinks it 's more important than it is . 
  you know whose rights i care about ? 
  living people 's . 
  i do n't care about a cluster of cells ' rights because it does n't have any , it 's a cluster of cells . 
  it ca n't think/feel/experience . 
  however , i ** do ** care about a kid that did n't choose to be born to a dead-beat dad . 
  in that case , his right to have a half-decent upbringing are ** way ** more important to me than the rights of the father who made a stupid mistake . 
  it certainly was n't as bad as losing internet points . 
  when i was younger i was a very picky eater . 
  one of my staples used to be vegemite on pasta . 
  that 's right , some pasta , little bit of butter and vegemite stirred all the way through . 
  in fact , i have a memory of going to a nice-ish restaurant where my mum knew i would n't be able to find anything i 'd eat so she brought a jar of vegemite in her purse and asked them to stir it into some plain pasta for me . 
  i want to be a brilliant psychologist who helps a lot of people . 
  i want to complete my thesis and have my works published . 
  i want to be an incredible dad and husband . 
  i want achieve a huge amount but always have time to enjoy my life . 
  so you can treat football players ? 
  you know you ca n't sleep with them if you 're their doctor right ? 
  you should read [ the happiness trap ] ( http://www.thehappinesstrap.com/ ) by dr. russ harris . 
  it 's on act ( acceptance and commitment therapy ) , a brilliant type of therapy that is become increasingly popular . 
  the point of the book is n't to tell you how to find happiness , no work of psychology should do that . 
  what the book teaches you is the traps in cognition that lead us to unhappiness . 
  best way to try it is just grab a nice big spoon and try it plain . 
  nah , i ca n't do that . 
  too cruel . 
  have only a tiny bit , it 's very strong and bitter . 
  oh wait , just forgot about lunch . 
  it 's the small aluminium bat he used to beat your mother to death . 
  edit : happy easter, 
  where 's spot ? 
  the fucking rug . 
  every time it gets me, 
  have you been waiting all day to use tabula rasa in a sentence ? 
  the science of sin by simon laham . 
  awesome experimental psychology book . 
  i 'm going to guess ... america . 
  1 ) i know that no job is perfect all the time and that i 'm going to have to do things that do n't provide innate motivation . 
  that 's why it 's so important to me that i take pride in all of my work , important or not . 
  i try to always keep the mindset that the current task i 'm doing is the * most * important one i 'll ever do . 
  2 ) i 'm happy in a workplace when i feel like i can grow and take on more responsibility . 
  i plan on being here for a while and really want the ability to progress and expand my role . 
  3 ) i would listen to their upset . 
  i think the first step to diffusing any problem is making sure the other person knows they 're being heard . 
  at the end of the day , even if i ca n't give them what they want , if they feel like they 've been heard and understood , they 'll leave less angry than they arrived . 
  same deal with australia, 
  you have no evidence to suggest the rate is n't * the same , you 're just guessing . 
  it 's very possible that it 's just easier to be out in those industries . 
  my strategy is just to make so many comments that no-one could ever sit and read through them all . 
  i worked out that i was born 9 months to the day after my dad 's 30th birthday . 
  sounds like a whole bunch of pseudo-scientific waffling to me . 
  you did * not * choose the right subreddit , sorry . 
  this subreddit is for questions only . 
  by the way , by rescue do you mean broken out ? 
  i went through a stage where i was smoking a lot every day and it was fucking up my life . 
  it was hard to stop but the withdrawals i had did n't last very long . 
  just try to get out of your old habits ( do n't hang out with friends who will smoke ) and give away all of your smoking equipment to friends . 
  mindfulness meditation has been shown in study after study to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms ( both of which have long-term negative health impacts aside from the obvious discomfort ) . 
  what makes you think you 're not depressed ? 
  how extreme are your ups ? 
  do they tend to affect your behaviour - for example , more risk-taking ? 
  one . 
  two is incorrect . 
  not all depression is the same . 
  it 's very possible you were having a major depressive episode before but are suffering from a dysthymic depression now ( dysthymia is a prolonged depression that is much less severe ) . 
  in fact , a lot of depression sufferers have both at the same time - long-term mild depression with major depressive episodes - it 's called a ` double depression ' . 
  i would recommend talking to your old therapist . 
  even if you 're not clinically diagnosable , talking to a good psychologist can help you through some down periods . 
  i 'm sorry but i really recommend getting any advice about this here . 
  your doctors have a much better idea than any anonymous stranger on the internet that can pretend to know what they 're talking about . 
  anyone with any medical knowledge would tell you that it 'd be stupid to try and diagnose your son over the internet . 
  i do n't know what you mean by, 
   . . doctors always falls in line with their profession versus based on my sons situation, 
  no and that 's my entire point . 
  relying on the input of strangers on the internet is really , really stupid . 
  i assume it 's just another new lame novelty account . 
  luckily for me i do n't make major life decisions on the basis of strangers on the internet 's opinions . 
  you sound like an asshole . 
  sex swing, 
  i do n't even mean what you plan to reply , i mean constantly calling her a bitch for not wanting to be more than friends with you . 
  you 're allowed to say no to giving her advice if you 're feeling used but calling her a bitch seems massively asshole-ish .
