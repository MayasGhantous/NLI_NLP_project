  i think that i am my mind and my mind is demonstrably a result of my brain . 
  when my brain stops receiving oxygen , i cease to exist and my body will begin to nourish the earth that nourished me my whole life . 
  it will be exactly like before i was born . 
  \u25e6 daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  what i do n't understand is why you care . 
  it sounds like she 's adding nothing as your friend and you say you 're not interested in more with her but you also sound very angry . 
  why give fucks ? 
  credit to mark twain :, 
  `` i do not fear death . 
  i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born , and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it . '' - mark twain, 
  also , she probably uses google too . 
  maybe you can bond over that website . 
   she had a picture cosplaying as chell, 
  i want her to know that he 's masturbated at least 20 times to that picture before he has even said hello . 
  edit : [ on his university page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/indianauniversity/comments/rvxto/for_love_and_creepiness/ ) - upvote it to make sure that she sees it and either falls madly in love with him or laughs at his creepiness . 
  either way , we win !, 
  if i met anyone in real life that asked me when the narwhal baconned , irrespective of their hotness , i would turn and walk away without saying another word . 
  sure , in this case it would make it easier to put a sack over my head but 9/10 it 's a good strategy . 
  apparently using english properly is n't full-proof . 
   her what is on fire ? 
  i do n't think you understand what proof is . 
  stay in the moment as much as you can . 
  communicate . 
  enjoy the closeness . 
  the mods tend to take a fairly hands-off approach to removing threads under that first rule ( although i do certainly remove some incredibly stupid questions from the new queue ) . 
  the vast , vast majority get downvoted instantly and those where enough interest exists , get to the front page . 
  if there 's that much interest ( and it 's genuinely interesting as you said ) we tend not to remove them . 
  my general rule of thumb is that i 'm far less likely to remove a post that 's already on the frontpage ( unless it breaks the personal information rule ) as i assume there 's a lot of interest . 
  good detective work notjesus, 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about or why you 're yelling it . 
  working . 
  got ta love that public holiday pay, 
  finding out about reddit, 
  you can be strong for them ** and ** be vulnerable at the same time . 
  it 's great that you want to support them but part of that will actually be that they can experience the upset with you . 
  you 're actually doing them a disservice to pretend that you 're not hurting in the same way they are because they want to feel understood right now . 
  it 's certainly not helpful for everyone to be a blubbering mess but do n't pretend to be okay when you 're not . 
  also , do n't forget that you deserve some looking after too through all of this . 
  creepy and desperate do n't rhyme with much . 
  i guess sleepy but that 's not very romantic . 
  if this does n't work i 'll need someone on the ground distributing flyers . 
  that 's so weird !, 
  i recently found out that my brother also uses google . 
  same !, 
  i 'm working friday/saturday/sunday / monday , 26 hours total . 
  i ca n't remember who but i heard an actor once say `` i apologise if i get an erection and i apologise if i do n't '', 
  nope . 
  legitimate iq tests require professional supervision to be administered . 
  also , you actually need to be a registered psychologist to even buy one . 
  you mean incredibly rich or incredibly stupid ? 
  she was being nice . 
  you 're really not that attractive . 
  that 's only because he 's wildly racist . 
  this is n't really a question of innate morality , it 's about authority . 
  what you 're asking is a very broad question . 
  based on reading a lot of papers on the topic - overall , people are mixed . 
  there are indications that people have natural inclinations towards charity , care and co-operation but there are also plenty of studies that show people will lie/cheat/steal in the right circumstance . 
  however , to answer your question , morality certainly does have ** some ** innate basis . 
  if it did n't , sociopaths would n't be different to non-sociopaths . 
  if you can be more specific i can probably steer you towards some research . 
  if you want research you 're going to need to be more specific . 
  you ca n't really test if people are born with or without morality , you can only test innate tendencies . 
  right which shows the opposite point . 
  people are naturally uncomfortable hurting other people unless there is reason to - in this cause authority . 
   sleep sex , or sexsomnia . . 
  at this point i started reading everything in zapp brannigan 's voice and could no longer take the article seriously . 
   sexsomnia can co-occur alongside other sleep disorders such as sleepwalking , sleep apnea , night terrors and bedwetting and can be triggered by stress , previous sleep deprivation and excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs . 
  is it particularly upsetting when she says no ? 
  please , upvote and promote this thread to everyone you can then . 
  the thread in indianauniversity as already at 54 on / all, 
  yes but you can objectively study subjective phenomena, 
  first of all , counsel . 
  secondly , if she does n't feel comfortable , you pressuring her is the ** worst ** thing you can do . 
  just be patient , some women are uncomfortable with parts/all of their body . 
  i do n't want to say anything , but you sound like a rather large , part of the body where faeces comes out . 
  ok you sound like an asshole . 
  there , i said it . 
  you happy now ? 
  are you ? 
  my so tells me i have great balls . 
  i have no idea what would make balls great but i guess it 's nice . 
  i worked with a girl who had never heard of the holocaust . 
  seriously , me and a friend were talking about the holocaust and we had to explain what it was to her . 
  turns out she 's not a fan of the nazis . 
  edit : to be clear , she was ~ 20 at the time . 
  why should we help you and not the other candidates ? 
  what makes you a deserving candidate ? 
  god i hate this bullshit . 
  every time i hear about beta males or friendzones i just feel bad for the fucking idiots who spend their life thinking attraction/relationships are this basic/simple . 
  it 's just sad . 
  spot on . 
  all it does it makes them into bitter assholes who * think * they 're nice guys but actually end up treating women like shit . 
  this is a terribly , terribly messy situation and is going to end up with one or both of you hurt . 
  becoming fuck buddies with an ex is very rarely a good idea because you should never be fuck buddies when one of you has deeper feelings for the other ( learned that one the hard way ) . 
  [ see ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/rxa6m/women_do_you_date_beta_males_nice_guys/c49dvb9 ), 
  haha i was going to ignore your other comment but i ca n't resist now . 
  you 're pathetic . 
  for one , the sheer irony of someone thinking that attraction is as simple as being an ` alpha male ' calling me juvenile is fucking hilarious . 
  secondly , i live with my wonderful girlfriend and we have a happy life together .
