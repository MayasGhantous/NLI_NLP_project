  i know it sounds lame but i swear it makes me kind of emotional to think about how many opportunities my kids will have that my parents did n't . 
  people upvote things they like/haven ' t seen . 
  if it 's getting upvotes it means enough people have n't seen it and it 's worth posting . 
  not every single person has heard every single joke ever written . 
  i 'll write a proper response to this later, 
  mr vagoo ? 
  which would have been a great point until he said `` way to be original '' which then implied his gripe was that it was n't an original joke . 
  you just stared at the ring , you 're going to die, 
  twilight !, 
  not kidding, 
  you had me at mandy patinkin . 
  i would turn for that man, 
  the departed . 
  my friend slammed it before i saw it so i was n't expecting much . 
  i do n't talk to him anymore . 
  i would turn for him, 
  yes these behaviours are normal for someone with depression and i highly recommend you see a professional therapist ( i mean this with absolutely no disrespect and do n't think of you as broken or anything like that ) . 
  are you currently seeing someone ? 
  how old are we talking ? 
  ouch dude , that 's pretty bad, 
  why do n't you tell the last friend that ? 
  story , please . 
  i do n't have that problem, 
  i just shed a tear for the youth of the next generation . 
  they wo n't even know what they 're missing . 
  as an australian i can tell you with certainty that it 's an american bar because no bar in australia would ever have a massive fosters sign up . 
  in my mind , american pie stopped making movies after the 3rd . 
  do you realise that i , and many other rational people , think you 're hilariously deluded ? 
  ( sincere question - i genuinely wonder what you think other people think of your activities ), 
  `` a lap dance is better '' off hooray for boobies by bloodhound gang . 
  okay , i do n't * still * like this album but i fast forwarded past it on my walkman many , many times .

  17 again ( the zac efron movie ) ... 
  i was on a date damnit, 
  we call pubs and bars , they 're a little bit different to each other ( mainly the price ) . 
  pubs are everywhere , we drink a lot of beer . 
  pubs are cheaper and will more often have food and older/no music . 
  bar is for a younger crowd , drinks cost twice as much and the music is so loud you ca n't talk . 
  they serve different purposes as you would n't try to meet a girl at a pub unless you were a 45 year old bogan ( a bogan is our equivalent of a redneck ) . 
  he * is * a liberal . 
  for those not in australia liberal ( big l ) is the name of our right-wing party ( confusingly enough ) and they 're currently led by an absolute moron . 
  the lady in the video is penny wong and she 's being insulted by a guy named bushby ( no that 's not a typical australian name before the jokes start ) . 
  in this economy ... 
  i 'll take it . 
  hope you like it , i ca n't use photoshop and have no skills with the computer so it took me ages . 
  which is a valid point only if the methods are scientific . 
  if the methods are falsifiable , verifiable and repeatable then sure . 
  also , large breasts indicate high levels of oestrogen during pregnancy and therefore are more unlikely to be infertile due to a lack of oestrogen ( according to a doco i saw a couple of years ago ), 
  well baby it do n't matter if your black or white oooooooh, 
  what 's updog ? 
  nothing and complain until my girlfriend fixes it . 
  do n't worry , they normally only attack when you 're asleep so as long as you do n't sleep you 'll be fine ...

  it was n't as bad as i expected but that 's saying something . 
  also , for anyone who has res the link is very obvious, 
  or the almost as bad :, 
  `` what do you want for dinner ? 
  `` i do n't mind what do you want ? '', 
  `` japanese '', 
  `` chinese '', 
  `` italian '', 
  `` indian '', 
  `` thai '', 
  `` subway/maccas/kfc etc. '', 
  `` what then ? '', 
  `` anything , i do n't mind '', 
  wow that 's whiter than sarah palin 's christmas dinner . 
  your link is n't hidden , nor is it random as it is clearly related to the topic . 
  terrible novelty account . 
  terrible . 
  he would have to charge . 
  yes , and i do . 
  however , my hope is that this will stop people making new ones . 
  if this thread stops one terrible novelty account it will have been worth it . 
  sleep ? 
  what 's that ? 
  she was , it was the same person as the blind guy . 
  [ rhyme generation by deaf adults ] ( http://jslhr.highwire.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/1/2 ), 
  it let everyone know about my thing for furries, 
  the abstract gives some interesting info . 
  go for your life type in the words ` deaf ' and ` rhyme ', 
  ding dong the witch is dead . 
  the really hard part was attaching the usb to your keychain . 
  there are many people already profiting from the ` green revolution ' . 
  i completely accept climate change but certain people are already making money off creating solutions or using misinformation to appear like they are helping ( just some off the top of my head ) :, 
  1 ) hybrid manufacturers : not a big difference in emissions but the batteries take an absurd amount of energy to make and recharge and some do more damage than good . 
  2 ) alternative energy suppliers ( solar panel roofs etc. 
  ) : these are starting to become a really viable option and the prices are coming down as they become more popular . 
  3 ) power plants costs a huge amount of money and is a very lucrative business . 
  ` green ' energy sells for a lot more money ( i used to work at an electricity company and it was like 25 % more ) . 
  also , you should always consider that people are very bad at changing their views . 
  whenever you have something like this it would take a lot of evidence to convince some people that they 're wrong . 
  for example , study after study has shown that organic food is generally the exact same quality ( in terms of taste and healthiness ) but far more expensive and actually worse for the environment ( the soil needs to be tilled many more times releasing more gases into the environment ) . 
  edit : added tl ; dr, 
  ** tl ; dr question everything , do your research and make sure you know the sources . 
  global warming is n't a myth but that does n't mean that all fixes are created equally . 
  the wicked witch . 
  it also lets me know that he 's already a [ -6 ] from me . 
  i feel like i 'm contributing to society .
