  that means that i believe that all people want to be happy and strive for self-actualisation but how they were raised can get in the way of that ( this is the opposite of the freudian view that suggests we strive for sex/violence but perfect parenting can reduce it ) . 
  i really believe that all people want to be happy , successful , create social ties and be good to those around them and that 's why i want to be a psychologist . 
  i 'll be able to help people find that part of themselves . 
  haha thanks pal . 
  it * is * very gratifying when people like what i have to say . 
  how many upvotes have you given me in total now ? 
  well , look , with the way cbt is taught these days you 'd think that freud had no idea what he was talking about . 
  of course large chunks are outdated but there is still a lot of value in conceptualising those parts of ourselves as unconscious drives . 
  i ca n't remember the exact number but i read recently that something like 80 % of the value of therapy is found in cross-over between different types of therapy ( patient-therapist alliance , active listening etc. ) . 
  there is some value to psychoanalysis . 
  i have n't read much of his original works so i 'll have to take your word for that . 
  some of the more modern psychoanalytic theories are pretty fascinating though . 
  for example , i think attachment theory is a must-read for anyone . 
  i love terror management theory too but i think it 's pretty fringe . 
  no problems at all but i think the flight to australia will cost more than a good local therapist would . 
  i hear so many people on reddit talk about pee shivers but i 've never had one . 
  are they good ? 
  what 's it like ? 
  a bit of a ball waft to the nostrils can be fantastic . 
  are you studying it or just a personal interest ? 
  ahh very cool !, 
  i do n't really care about total karma as much as i love seeing a comment that i put a lot of thought into being appreciated by others . 
  i was at a music festival ( the kind where you camp there ) one time and my back was so bad we had to leave . 
  with my back , i know it 's really bad if i * ca n't * crack it . 
  just before we left , i found a massage tent and hoped that it would loosen it up a bit . 
  after my massage , i tried to crack it and it cracked like 25 times each turn . 
  best feeling i 've ever had . 
  ooo wow , thanks buddy . 
  often . 
  the odds of me ever having existed are incalculably small , yet here i am , talking shit with people on the other side of the world . 
  it 's fucking absurd . 
  awww , thanks . 
  that 's very sweet . 
  not sure about your country but in australia we have private and public hospitals . 
  the waiting is longer and you 're not going to get a room to yourself but public hospitals are free . 
  also , you get a rebate whenever you visit your local doctor and most doctors are as cheap or just a little bit more than the rebate ( so you 'll pay a $ 20 gap or something for some doctors ) . 
  we then have private health insurance on top of that ( that helps with elective issues , gets you into a private hospital instead of public , helps with things like physiotherapy/psychologists etc. ), 
  and we get a tax break from the government when we purchase it because it takes stress off of the public health system . 
  tl ; dr australia is better than your country, 
  but you still have to pay for those treatments right ? 
  like , they ca n't refuse you treatment but you still get a crippling bill afterwards ?

  not saying i do n't believe you but i 'd like to see some evidence because that 's a pretty big claim . 
  it sounds like you would get benefit out of talking to a psych ** ologist ** about all of this . 
  it 's not uncommon to have an experience like that affect you and you clearly have a lot of thoughts running through your head . 
  in addition , anxiety attacks are horrible and i 'm sure you want someone to help you through them . 
  because introverts are different to extroverts . 
  it 's common but if it upset you , you need to explain that to him so he understands . 
  because it costs a lot of money to make a scientific publication . 
  there is a strong push for them to become open-source but that would require a lot of funding . 
  glad to hear you did n't take it personally ( i 'm the guy who posted it on / r/indianuniversity ) . 
  i genuinely did n't mean it to hurt you and i 'm glad you 're finding humour in it . 
  please let me know how the meet-up goes , i 'm cheering for you guys !, 
  what an odd question, 
  if you work in a lab then i 'm sure you have access to them anyway so i 'm not sure if i understand where you 're coming from . 
  infrastructure still costs money . 
  physical publishing is n't the only cost ( and they could n't stop doing physical publications anyway ) . 
  whether or not they can , it 's really , really not worth risking it . 
  what an appropriate workplace conversation you were having with your boss . 
  not a problem . 
  they 're not as common but try to find someone who does psychodynamic psychotherapy . 
  it 's a much more open format where you 're allowed to talk more freely . 
  what makes you think he 's lying ? 
  i 'm accomplishing a huge amount while spending my leisure time on the internet . 
  why must it be an all or nothing ? 
  let 's say there 's a 1 % chance this is real ( i think it 's higher but i 'll be generous ) . 
  if we help : there 's a 1 % chance that giving him advice helps him substantially and a 99 % chance we waste no more than 15 seconds of our lives . 
  i think it 's worth it . 
  i apologise for my confusion, 
  playing internet therapist without having a clue what you 're talking about is a bad idea . 
  you have no idea about what is going on in this kid 's life and all of your ideas are meaningless speculation . 
  i never said that he did n't . 
  i 'm saying that neither of us can possibly know that based on second hand information . 
  do you constantly update it ? 
  if so , i 'm sure i could think of heaps more . 
  this is something you should be discussing with the person who prescribes it to you , not anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  exactly . 
  this ** could ** have long-ranging effects on him psychologically and he ** may ** need help and support . 
  my genes, 
  this has been shown to work in a bunch of different studies . 
  i want you to just simply start writing down your feelings . 
  anything that comes to your heard right now , just right it down , no matter how stupid it sounds . 
  it will relieve a big chunk of your anxiety ( and has actually been shown to improve test scores if done just before a test ) . 
  the other thing you can do is close your eyes and just start breathing . 
  i want you to focus intensely on the sensation of each breath going in and out of your mouth . 
  focus as hard as you can for as long as you can . 
  if you notice your mind shifting to your study , gently remind yourself that you can study as soon as you 're done and refocus on your breath . 
  feel every sensation as the air goes in and out . 
  what the fuck ? 
  did your parents report that shit ? 
  that 's not okay . 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . 
  also , unless you 've seen him sucking another man 's cock , you ca n't be sure . 
  get some sleep you idiot . 
  no-one works well without sleep , that 's not a thing that exists . 
  go to sleep you idiot . 
  sounds like complete and utter bullshit . 
  it 's your link karma . 
  it 's 1 because you have 1 link karma . 
  start with journey,
