  if you post that number again i 'll ban you . 
  the post has been removed . 
  personal information is ** not ** okay . 
  i 've just become 99 % convinced that you 're an idiot . 
  i made one called toppedyourstory where i would reply to people 's askreddit stories with incredibly elaborate made up stories . 
  it went well but it was way too much effort . 
  i also made one called tokenblindguy who i would use to respond to people who said `` i see what you did there '' with `` i did n't '' . 
  it was hilarious to me for a while . 
  with a scarecrow you sillybilly, 
  wait , when you want more than just friends you tell them you love them ? 
  spider milk is delicious . 
  that sounds illegal ( and is in my country ) . 
  i 'd contact the sheriff . 
  hey , you 're derpette from the [ church name ] right ? 
  `` yes '', 
  how 's it going , i 'm derpington . 
  nice to meet you . 
  do n't overthink it buddy,

  that we were by far the most moral , healthy , educated and peaceful of any time in history ( at that stage ) but still took way too long to give equal rights to all .

  does wilw count ? 
  it sounds like you need to talk to a psych ** ologist ** about this . 
  you may have depression based on what you 've said ( impossible to know without a proper professional visit ) and you would get real benefit out of therapy . 
  even if you 're not clinically depressed , it sounds like talking to a professional about why you feel so down would be helpful . 
  this would destroy me, 
  call the cops . 
  crazy timing . 
  i looked at your question , did n't know the answer , and went to do something else listening to some podcasts . 
  i happened to open a 60-second mind episode that was talking about this exact issue . 
  apparently new research suggests that there is a psychologically true component to the crack-down . 
  the episode is called `` first impressions can be quite accurate '' and they refer to a published article that you should be able to find easily . 
  got pulled into a rip at a secluded australian beach and i 'm not a confident swimmer . 
  as a result , i started having a panic attack which caused me to struggle to move and swallow a lot of beach water . 
  it really depends . 
  in this case it was * just * beyond where i could stand . 
  so , i 'd swim as hard as i could , put my foot down and feel it sweep off the edge of the sand . 
  that 's what i ended up doing and it did work . 
  at the time though , my thought process was `` if using every bit of my energy is keeping me in the same spot , swimming sideways will mean i go backwards '' , which i 've since learned , would n't be that bad because it could potentially take me behind the rip . 
  well ... as the official representative of the innovators of the english language ...

  listening to stand-up comedy and avoiding my assignment . 
  and you have n't even seen the pictures i sent to the mods . 
  they 're okay with it because they know that language naturally evolves and as long as people are being understood it 's all okay . 
  have you seen the show funny as hell ? 
  it 's a collection of stand-ups recorded in montreal and they 've got some of my favourites . 
  my penis, 
  cells need to multiply , they do n't multiply perfectly , ergo aging . 
  it 's kind of like taking a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy . 
  this is n't the sort of advice you should be getting off the internet . 
  have her talk to her doctor/psychiatrist . 
  your role is to try and get them to talk about it with a professional . 
  at 46 you 're lucky to get 2 a week, 
  we 've already had one incident , please ** do n't ** post pictures from facebook . 
  they can be easily tracked back to you . 
  piggy-backing on your top comment , sorry .

  reply to the people in that particular post . 
  this is incredibly unlikely to reach them . 
  incredibly naive and stupid . 
  feel free to justify things to yourself as you like but smoking will most likely kill you . 
  do what ? 
  to have a look at an online dating website . 
  three years later i 'm living with , and soon to propose to , my wonderful so . 
  umm ... pork ? 
  here 's a great rule of thumb ; if you could n't tell your girlfriend about it , you probably should n't be doing it . 
  as for thoughts though , you should never feel bad about what you ** think ** as you have absolutely no control over that , only how you act . 
  realise that it 's normal to miss certain things in a relationship and that you feel like the sacrifice is worth it for the benefits of having a girlfriend ( or not and leave ) . 
  my so takes a while to fall asleep so i 'll often stay up for a bit with her . 
  however , i can literally fall asleep in seconds once i turn around . 
  weirdly though , i 'm terrible at napping and ca n't sleep in for the life of me . 
  if i wake up at 6:30 , i 'm up , ca n't go back to sleep . 
  woah , settle down buddy . 
  i 'm just trying to help people . 
  i did n't post that for personal benefit . 
  i do n't really know why you 're getting so upset . 
  it took up about an inch and a half of your page and it was there to help people . 
  if you find it that annoying , feel free to use [ res ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ) to put me on ignore . 
  how much good food and wine does it take for you to have sex with your family ? 
  i believe that larger breasts also signal that the woman had sufficient oestrogen during puberty and is therefore more likely to have a fully-functioning reproductive system .

  i * guess * that it 's better than him talking about how great the anal was . 
  right ? 
  do n't leave us hanging ... 
  ... how was it ? 
  was n't a conversation but ... 
  i was at my friend 's house ( there were 5 of us hanging out ) and we were going to watch a movie i downloaded . 
  however , i realised that i forgot the dvd . 
  so , i drove everyone back to my place ( we were going to get food on the way ) and went and got the dvd . 
  as we were walking out , i realised that my mother did n't know i was home . 
  i knew this because she was have ** very loud ** sex with my step-dad . 
  they started pissing themselves laughing and i shoved everyone out the front door . 
  tl ; dr all my friends heard my mum having loud sex . 
  if he actually did it why do you think you did the wrong thing and why are you still friends with him ? 
  i kind of wish i 'd saved my top comments , they 're lost in the sea of my terrible comments . 
  does n't work for me , i 've tried :(, 
  ps : thanks,
