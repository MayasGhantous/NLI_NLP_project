  thanks buddy, 
  i was taught that the earth was slightly less than 6000 years old . 
  private religious schooling , the best education money can buy . 
  [ this has never failed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar6ymjekoos ), 
  why are you straight ? 
  i think you 'll find it 's the same answer . 
  i have no idea what but i 'm sorry that i 'm such an asshole .

  a really good poo, 
  i love the original but that version is absurdly calming . 
  go to bed , you dingus, 
  good write-up about it [ here ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=vestibular+system ), 
  has n't happened to me in recent times but kaylee from firefly used to do that to me . 
  meh , they 're no hanson, 
  buy it yourself , it 's cheap . 
  if it 's creating issues for you , you could always talk to a psych ** ologist ** about it . 
  they can teach you strategies to control it while working out why you 're getting so angry . 
  in the short-term , start meditating , it has been proven to help . 
  an interesting new study found that when participants were forced to use their non-dominant hand for a week , they became much less aggressive , the idea is that self-control is something that needs to be practised . 
  that 's probably why meditation is so efficacious . 
  you did n't mention the head injury before . 
  have you ever visited a neuropsychologist ? 
  actually the evidence suggests that outward displays of aggression are counter-productive in learning to be less aggressive . 
  this is because you start angry , act aggressively and then are rewarded with a reduction in your anger . 
  therefore , the behaviour becomes more and more conditioned . 
  have you ever tried meditating ? 
  go to itunes and search for `` ucla mindfulness '' . 
  it 's really easy and just a few minutes a day can have a huge impact on depressive/anxious symptoms and will increase your self-control . 
  glad to hear it buddy , let me know if you need any support , just pm me any time . 
  my sister got really angry at my parents . 
  she yelled `` that 's it . 
  i 'm running away . 
  drive me to [ our grandparent 's names ] '' . 
  hooray for poor parenting being made up for with cruel parenting . 
  there 's nothing you can do beyond making sure he takes his meds . 
  psychosis feels real , irrespective of evidence that suggest otherwise . 
  you ca n't talk him out of it . 
  the . 
  out . 
  this is not okay behaviour, 
  your body decomposes . 
  i would take away the second half of the movie . 
  if you want link karma , try to find interesting new content from around the web , there 's plenty to be found . 
  if you want comment karma , you need to spend time in the new queues . 
  make funny/insightful comments on the ones that make the frontpage and your karma shoots up . 
  i spend pretty much all of mine in / r/askreddit but there 's plenty of karma to be found in other subreddits if that 's your aim . 
  and none of those posts got anywhere near the frontpage . 
  if you do n't want to deal with terrible content , do n't sit in the new queue . 
  no amount of complaining will ever get rid of bad questions , nor will reminders from mods . 
  deal with it with downvotes like everyone else . 
  i upvoted her , just because you 're a cock . 
  in australia - normal, 
  it 's not slander if it 's factual . 
  that does n't mean he wo n't try though . 
  relationships offer you a lot of benefits that sex does n't . 
  if you think that the only reason to be in a relationship is regular sex , you 're not mature enough to be in one . 
  i would n't trade my relationship with my so for any amount of meaningless sex , it 's just not the same . 
  * edit * : for example ; companionship , closeness , intimacy , affection , care , vicarious achievement , complexity of relationship ( get to know eachother/relate differently over time ) , openness , sex is actually better with someone you 're intimate with ( in my opinion obviously ) , having a family , having a stable home life , having some who cares about whether you succeed or not , having someone care if you 're a good person or not , someone you can share experiences with , someone to call you on your shit , someone who makes you a better person , being able to feel like you make someone you care about a better person , not worrying about stds , not worrying about if you 're `` sticking your dick in crazy '' . 
  to be clear , relationship psychology theorists suggest that there are three main parts of relationships ; passion , commitment and intimacy ( lots of different theories but they basically use different names for these 3 parts ) . 
  if you 're having ** just ** sex with someone , you get some passion but almost nothing of the other two . 
  for those to exist , you need time and closeness . 
  how is it hypocritical to notice you 've been doing something wrong and changing it ? 
  it 's only being hypocritical if you complain about it ** and ** you do n't stop doing it yourself . 
  if anything , realising you 're doing something wrong and changing is the ** exact opposite ** of being a hypocrite . 
  it 's not `` bad '' in that you 're not doing the wrong thing by anyone but you 're certainly limiting your own opportunities . 
  if you 're banned you 'd know about it . 
  your posts are probably getting caught in the spam filter . 
  if this happens , message the moderators of ** that ** subreddit . 
  there . 
  situation . 
  where . 
  you . 
  cheated . 
  leave him now . 
  it 's that simple . 
  op has been banned from askreddit . 
  we have zero tolerance for this kind of thing . 
  ask him if he has seen rampart, 
  edit : holy fuckballs that clip is incredible . 
  it made me want to get my drum kit from my parent 's place . 
  step 1 ) listen more , talk/think less . 
  you just think they do . 
  wrong subreddit pal . 
  i already removed this once . 
  if you keep posting it , i 'll have to take further steps . 
  of course it matters . 
  if i pull my cock out at every party and think everyone loves it but they 're secretly deciding that they never want to see me again , surely that means there 's a meaningful difference . 
  all sorts of classy going on right here, 
  supercilious - behaving or looking as though one thinks one is superior to others . 
  i love it because it generally defines a very serious person but it sounds like `` super silly '', 
  holy shit , i read that and ca n't stop crying . 
  i ca n't imagine the pain you went through . 
  i 'm so , so sorry . 
  that 's an interesting and actually quite complicated question . 
  the very simple answer is that virtually all mental illnesses are a combination of nature and nurture ( there are some exceptions , obviously ) . 
  from the nature side , genes play a very important role . 
  they can dictate things like how big areas of your brain are and which neurochemicals you get too much/little of . 
  even more amazing , it can change the way you react to neutral stimuli ( some people are wired to be more likely to think of others as potential threats ) . 
  in addition to these nature elements , nurture is very important . 
  do you receive adequate nutrition ?
