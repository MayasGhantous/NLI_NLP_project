  have you had enough socialisation ? 
  were you treated well by your parents ? 
  do you have opportunities to thrive ? 
  have you gone through any traumas ? 
  lastly , there 's what we call the reciprocal gene-environment model . 
  this suggests that people choose environments that fit their nature . 
  for example , an anxious person is likely to spend time with people who do activities that do n't provoke their anxiety . 
  as a result , they do n't resolve their anxiety and become more anxious . 
  that when i finally finish studying and am a practising psychologist , that i 'll be really good at what i do . 
  i 'm working my ass off now to make sure it happens but if i can look back at my life and know that i 've really left the world a better place , there can be no greater gift . 
  i think it sounds like a word the monty python guys would make up . 
  do n't be a fucking asshole . 
  be a man and break up with her . 
  why would you assume all guys are like that when 90 % of the responses are outrage ? 
  you did the right thing . 
  if she 's willing to cheat on her husband for you , you need to find a new `` love of your life '' because she 'd do the same to you . 
  great opportunity to move on . 
  if you 're suffering from depression you need to see a professional . 
  please seek a psychologist . 
   `` put yours through first . '', 
  i 'm not sure if you 've ever seen a vagina but they 're not well designed for putting through holes . 
  until i became a mod i had absolutely no idea how many posts get deleted . 
  also , there is n't really an easy mechanism to do this . 
  the delete function is built in to reddit and we do n't have an easy way to change that . 
  if you want us to discuss it in moderator chat , there are two big issues :, 
  1 ) we get flooded with messages constantly and it would potentially be unseen by other moderators, 
  2 ) there are n't always two moderators on . 
  as an australian , i 'm often the only one online during my most active hours . 
  i 've explained in a post why i think it 's a bad idea and i 'm going to remove the thread because it does n't fit within the guidelines , as it 's not a question . 
  if you have any suggestions please feel free to message us or even pm me personally . 
  why would facebook care ? 
  if you do n't like it , do n't be friends with the people that do it . 
  it 's not a complicated solution, 
  genuinely horrible idea that has essentially 0 chance of ever being used . 
  no it does n't . 
  feel free to get a cat . 
  they do n't mean each individual child is a victim every 20 minutes . 
  because otherwise you have people deciding what you can and ca n't have free speech about . 
  let 's say i ** hate ** black people . 
  i think it 's pretty easy to see little utility in allowing me to have hate speech against them . 
  what if i ** hate ** the republican party ? 
  should i not be allowed to call them out on their bullshit ? 
  what if i hate religion ? 
  what if i had atheism ? 
  who 's to say that they 're not useful forms of speech ? 
  that 's hate speech . 
  exactly and it 's simply false . 
  [ steven pinker 's ted talk on how there 's less violence than there ever was ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html ), 
  cognitive behavioural therapy , meditation , exercise and setting yourself small achievable goals . 
  have evidence of all of those things . 
  talk to a lawyer ** before ** you leave . 
  so , it would 've been less than half if you were n't a smoker ? 
  the only thing more obscene than the / r/atheism circlejerk ( besides / r/politics ) is the / r/atheism is a circlejerk , circlejerk . 
  it 's so brave . 
  trying to constantly prove i was smarter than everyone else . 
  it worked really well on 2/3 shit friends and just alienated everyone else . 
  i listen to a song called ironic where none of the listed things were ironic , thereby making the ultimate irony . 
  well , there 's a big difference between your experience and what 's happening in the entire western world . 
  some mental health disorders are over-diagnosed in some areas ( for example , adhd ) but under-diagnosed in others . 
  the problem is that they 're much harder to diagnose than physical health disorders and the general public understand them less . 
  you may be suffering from depression and you may not be , it 's possible that you just do n't realise it . 
  i would n't generalise that to mean the entire western world is in the wrong though . 
  recent studies have shown that regular exercise is as good as prozac in reducing stress . 
  that being said , exercise ca n't just fix everything . 
  did you ignore everything i said except for the small part that agreed with you ? 
  i feel the same way when people constantly complain about the `` quality '' of reddit . 
  in a post about guilty pleasures i mentioned that i enjoy getting a lot of upvotes on a comment because it 's nice to have people think you 're interesting/funny . 
  as a result , a lot of people tagged me as `` likes upvotes '' and will tell me every time they upvote me . 
  it somewhat misses the point but it 's sweet and i do always thank them . 
  for those wondering , giving anti-depressants to someone with bipolar actually makes the bipolar far worse . 
   you 're probably just ** too ** stupid for school, 
  ftfy, 
  sorry , that 's a bit above my knowledge level . 
  i study psychology so i know a bit about meds but not as much as a psychiatrist . 
  i have n't heard of it though . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  i 'm saying that i do n't care if you do n't think the content is perfect , especially when the content is user-generated . 
  thanks , buddy . 
  thanks pal, 
  fair, 
  thanks pal, 
  i respect that . 
  / r/askscience, 
  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  although we 're considering banning pima again , just to annoy everyone . 
  i 'd say the modmail was more positive than negative about the flair . 
  sure . 
  feel free to message with suggestions any time . 
  they 're always read . 
  i agree with a lot of what you 're saying . 
  when i say that we get a lot of complaints , i 'm trying to show people that it 's impossible to please everyone and for every `` this is the worst subreddit ever '' we get for a decision , we get plenty of `` thank you so much '' . 
  i know we ca n't please everyone and i 'm not trying to . 
  the reason i want to let the people discuss is so they feel like they have a voice and because with that many people , we 're sure to get good ideas . 
  also , i think story posts are fine but if the overwhelming majority do n't want them , i 'm more than happy to say they should n't be allowed . 
  that 's not true . 
  my body was n't decomposing before i was born . 
  according to qi there 's one sure-fire cure for hiccups . 
  digital-anal stimulation . 
  i do n't * think * it needs to be digital , have n't tested though . 
  i like the idea of a red wine sauce .
