  i 've looked at a couple of recipes and they 're quite varied . 
  how would you recommend i make it ? 
  note : i 'm cooking duck breast in a pan so there will be plenty of pan juices if needed . 
  i recently went cold turkey off caffeine . 
  worst headaches i 've ever had . 
  literally , they would buckle me at the knees . 
  i could n't function for almost a week . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  however , if you 're struggling to get enough time , try some yoga nidra meditation . 
  ucla have some free guided meditations and they 've got the evidence to show it works too . 
  there 's a great documentary on paraphilia . 
  the name is escaping me right now but i 'll link it when i remember . 
  i get that you 're probably making a joke but no-one chooses to have an unusual fetish . 
  even though there 's about a 99 % chance this is a troll , attitudes like that are n't helpful . 
  do you mean [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ) ? 
   i 'm not the pheasant plucker , i 'm the pheasant plucker 's son . 
  i 'm only plucking pheasants 'till the pheasant plucker comes . 
  say it as fast as you can . 
  with # 27 , it 's also worth remember that several parts of our brain , especially those that are worried about what 's real and what is n't ( like the prefrontal cortex ) are basically shut down during sleep . 
  some dream theories suggest that our distorted reality is simply a function of those parts of the brain being inactive . 
  the problem is that voting is actually a fairly irrational thing to do . 
  the problem is that your vote almost certainly counts for nothing and the amount of effort you invest can be used far , far better . 
  of course , if no-one votes the system breaks down but that 's the rationale .

  i think the easiest to understand example is the prisoner 's dilemma . 
  you can draw it up in a 2x2 grid and even get people to tell you what they 'd do before you explain why they 're wrong . 
  i 've noticed that i make a groaning noise sometimes when i sit down .

  / r/doesanybodyelse, 
  the one with the creepy 25 year old sitting at it . 
  she was n't ** that ** far off . 
  i do n't know that laughing at her face would be a proportional response . 
  it does n't look like anything , it 's a concept . 
  it really was n't that deep . 
  psychology . 
  i love learning about it , i love teaching people about it and i look forward to being a great therapist one day . 
  i answered your question . 
  you asked what i look like , i said that it 's a nonsense question and has no logical answer . 
  sounds like they 're the child abusers . 
  i do n't even understand what her concern was . 
  where 's your favourite place that you 've been ? 
  why ? 
  almost certainly not . 
  however , there are some stds you can get like that . 
  make sure you 've both been tested before you touch without a condom . 
  it 's incredibly unhealthy and you can suffer from psychosis . 
  besides anything else , without sufficient sleep you 're heavily cognitively impaired . 
  your work will be shit unless you get some sleep . 
  it can have several other functions . 
  alternatively , she may have already started taking it and did n't stop since her last partner ( not uncommon ) . 
  i hate people complaining about reddit . 
  the content is user-generated . 
  the frontpage is decided by what people like . 
  how fucking absurd is it to think that all of the content will always meet your tastes . 
  it 's insane . 
  you ca n't spell pyrrhic victory without victory, 
  there 's a dude who gets really angry if you eat bacon or touch yourself , even if no-one is watching . 
  are you trying to tell me that not everyone on reddit sees every other submission ? 
  what the fuck are they doing with their lives ? 
  relevant : how old are you and do you have a moustache ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/445/untitled.jpeg ), 
  i think it 's even more simple than that . 
  there are parts of the interaction you can control and parts you ca n't . 
  the parts you can ( how you act/interact ) are deemed important when you succeed and unimportant when you do n't . 
  conversely , the the parts you ca n't control ( how she acts/interacts ) needs to be justified away as ** not ** a result of your actions , otherwise it means that you `` failed '' . 
  i think that 's more the issue , the idea that you should want/be able to get any girl . 
  exactly this . 
  if not having a girlfriend causes her to cheat , you do n't want to be with her . 
  if you want to be exclusive and she does n't , that sounds like a deal-breaker . 
  it 's fine for her to want it , just only if he 's comfortable with it . 
  if that 's what she needs , she needs to find a guy who is okay with it ( there are plenty out there ) . 
  itt a lot of 13 year old boys ( all downvoted to shit , to be fair ), 
  `` uh . . sorry emma ... i sleep masturbate a lot '', 
  bedding commensurate with number of souls, 
  it 's on the frontpage if you scroll to the bottom . 
  everytime i see it , res makes it disappear instantly . 
  `` this is the song that does n't end , yes it goes on and on my friend ... '', 
  there 's no good evidence to suggest that disparities in iq tests are the result of genetic endowment . 
  it was believed to be true ( by some ) for a while but the modern evidence is clear . 
  i say i need to go pee when i 've got a few farts stored up . 
  i get baaad pains if i wait too long . 
  why would you waste the opportunity to speak to an incredibly accomplished person by making a terrible joke ? 
  why do n't you try to ask something interesting ? 
  `` did the incident with leno change your perceptions of hollywood or do you need to be ready for that sort of thing at all times ? '', 
  `` how would you suggest a young comic gets started ? '', 
  `` what have you learned from the incredible and diverse writing rooms you 've been in ? '', 
  she did n't like you pal . 
  she was trying to be nice ( what she did is n't ) or she was confused . 
  this is n't about nice guys finishing last , this is just about a girl not being into you . 
  the older you get , the higher proportion of girls go for `` nice '' guys . 
  be yourself and attract the kind of girls who are into nice guys . 
  you would n't want one that is n't anyway . 
  also , please do n't listen to any alpha/beta male bullshit or friendzone or any of that crap . 
  it 's just a way of shifting blame for guys who ca n't accept that not all women want them all of the time . 
  it really varies . 
  also , he might be wearing a slightly too small size which would reduce sensitivity even more . 
  also , consider both getting std tests and then going on birth control . 
  you wrote that whole essay on your phone ? 
  that 's keen . 
  you fucking monster,
