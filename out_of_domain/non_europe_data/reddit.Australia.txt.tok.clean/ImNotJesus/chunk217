  not sure about that but without gravity , the force of the ejaculation would shoot you backwards with equal force . 
  it would propel you quite far really, 
  source : ndt, 
  the price of the movie does n't change how ethical the action is , it only changes how likely you are to transgress your own ethics to watch it . 
  yeh , that is n't normal . 
  it sounds like he 's germophobic and possibly suffers from ocd . 
  `` more evolved '' is a meaningless concept, 
  they could really save a lot of money by letting the bigger animals eat the smaller ones . 
  in that case he 's a fucking moron, 
  you 're experiencing what is called [ confirmation bias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) . 
  basically , people are incredibly bad at ~ ~ recognising ~ ~ understanding patterns because we notice some things better than others . 
  in this case , you notice all of the ones that conform to your theory but do n't notice the one 's that do n't . 
  i would bet that if you wrote down each song change you 'd see there was n't a pattern . 
  this is n't at all my area of expertise but i was at a dan dennett lecture a few days ago and he was talking about a true random generator . 
  i did n't really understand ( and it probably is n't relevant ) but i think there is a way to have true random generators . 
  it 's the only way to become a mod . 
  i regret everything . 
  i really want to know my karma per post score . 
  i think it would be pretty depressingly low . 
  how do you know that ? 
  for those wondering why kimcheekumquat is upset ; he had a comment * that was receiving upvotes in a post that was removed for not even being close to fitting askreddit guidelines . 
  when it was removed ( by another mod ) he became very upset because we cost him `` comment of the year '' ( his words ) . 
  he then posted a link to his own comment on / r/bestof and acused me of maliciously downvoting it . 
  sweet , thanks . 
  creepy but kinda cool, 
  holy fuckballs , you 've made 45,000 comments . 
  that 's like 130 a day since you made your account . 
  if we assume that you sleep 8 hours a day , you 're posting more than 8 times per waking hour . 
  consistently . 
  he deleted his post because of that 1 downvote . 
  ps : it was n't me . 
  i think most people on / r/bestof instantly downvote anyone who links to themselves ( for good reason too ) . 
  i do n't really understand how you think that makes you look good . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tiqo6.png ) is the rest of the conversation . 
  for those wondering , the link under the word `` wow '' was the link to his bestof post . 
  the first comment is what he sent to the mods to initiate conversation . 
  thanks for pointing that out , i probably could 've worded it better . 
  i editted for clarity . 
  okay, 
  i just do n't get why you think it 's shitty moderation . 
  your ** entire ** argument was that it `` cost you upvotes '' . 
  no matter how much that may upset you , we 're not going to keep a post on the front page that ** clearly ** does n't fit in the subreddit just so you can accumulate internet points . 
  i really want to know what he said . 
  looking through his comment history is hilarious . 
  sorry , it was probably my bad . 
  have an upvote as my apology . 
  that was the only one i saw . 
  what were the others ? 
  haha that 's brilliant . 
  i got posted to srs yesterday . 
  i decided to explain what i meant because i thought they were misunderstanding my point . 
  that was met with a barrage of abusive comments and then being banned from srs . 
  awesome !, 
  i was trying to get a screenshot of it but missed it . 
  thanks !, 
  do n't stress buddy , it 's a pretty common misconception . 
  i think it 's very natural to think of intelligence as a higher form of evolution because that 's our experience of the world . 
  report posts that break the rules and i 'll thank you all the time !, 
  because you do n't * actually * want to watch them . 
  you want to want to watch them, 
  this is a horrible , horrible idea ( the first part ) . 
  it 's incredibly unhealthy and prolonged lack of sleep can lead to psychosis . 
  it sounds like these are things you need to talk to a doctor/psychologist about . 
  there are many interventions but you should try and find some support . 
  what about sexlexia ? 
  really eats days , do n't initiate this . 
  wow there really are ** a lot ** of misconceptions in this thread . 
  1 ) survival of the fittest is n't about heading in a direction . 
  it 's simply the mechanism that causes some organisms to survive and reproduce while others do n't . 
  2 ) ** society is part of our evolution ** . 
  we 've evolved to function well in societies . 
  one of the reasons for this is it improves our genetic fitness because those who would n't have survived previously can ( medicine , social support etc. ) . 
  this does n't mean we 're stopping evolution . 
  ** it is evolution ** . 
  open a youtube playlist full of justin bieber songs . 
  hopefully my death could bring some good to the world by raising aware of this horrible disease . 
  wow . 
  creepy . 
  you can ignore through res . 
  also , just keep posting those links , it makes him look like a huge douchebag . 
  i downvoted him as soon as i saw it . 
  look , i 'll be honest , i think we can both survive the few downvotes from him . 
  it comes with the territory . 
  think i 've never been downvoted for being a mod ? 
  you 've seen all the mod hate the last few weeks . 
  there are way more people who upvote you everytime they see you . 
  do n't stress about it mate . 
  it 's normal that the more notoriety you get the more people will try to chop you down . 
  yeh it 's a pretty tough line sometimes . 
  there are definitely some people that i would ban if it were up to me but i know the mod group are more permissive than i am so i respect that . 
  when the girl ends up with the incredibly creepy/stalkerish guy because he became even more creepy/stalkerish . 
  climbing into someone 's bedroom while they sleep is n't romantic . 
  you should be arrested . 
  i used to . 
  i think it 's normal for a lot of guys to do it at one time or another ( hopefully not too long ) before growing out of it . 
  i was listening to a podcast the other day that described exactly how i feel about it ( you made it weird - guest = kumail nanjiani ) . 
  they were talking about picking up girls after gigs ( they 're comedians ) and kumail was saying that once the girl actually said yes , he did n't really care anymore . 
  i was definintely like that for a while . 
  there 's nothing wrong with it if it makes you happy and you 're treating the girls with respect but it definitely does n't fulfill you . 
  as for what does fulfill me .
