  ~ ~ upvotes ~ ~ i love being with a partner that i 'm close to , it 's a completely different feeling . 
  i love learning . 
  i love teaching about the things i love learning ( seriously , any time you want to learn about psychology , just message me ) . 
  i love feeling like i 'm growing as a person . 
  i ** love ** helping people . 
  these things make you feel satisfied with your life and fulfill you in a way that sex ca n't . 
  my family thinks that now that i 'm an atheist , i actually * hate * jews ( i grew up jewish ) . 
  seriously , the other day my mother called me upset because i made a completely inoffensive joke and said that `` it 's fine if you want to be an atheist but you do n't have to hate our people '' . 
  good excuse not to hang out with them though . 
  not ** everyone ** that masturbates for 8 hours straight is on meth . 
  i 've read all of your posts, 
  * creepy smile *, 
  it 's called being greedy . 
  i do n't normally upvote novelties but i like this . 
  subtle but clever . 
  there was no permanent injury but easily the most painful experience of my life . 
  have you ever been cutting chillies and then gone to the bathroom ? 
  no words can describe it . 
  wow that 's dedication . 
  i post ** a lot ** . 
  i know it was a pretty ~ ~ shit ~ ~ bad experience but not every dad cares that much . 
  it 's pretty sweet that he was so worried . 
  by the way , the overwhelming majority of cutters do n't do so because they `` like pain '' . 
  i know you probably were n't trying to make that assertion but it 's important to clear it up . 
  edit : poor choice of words, 
  when i was little , my sister convinced me that the hottest ever day was 100 degrees ( celsius , obviously ) and that only one man survived . 
  he was able to survive because `` he lived in an iceblock '' . 
  little imnotjesus did n't have a problem with this story and believed it for years . 
  did you watch speed too many times when you were little ? 
  pfft , you 're still up to only like a week ago . 
  there 's some really good stuff about 6 months back . 
  actually , while you 're there , i got a huge amount of upvotes for posting hahahahahahah one time but i have n't been able to find the link . 
  when you get up to it can you give it to me ? 
  thanks , pal . 
  same with saying goodbye on the phone . 
  it 's just rude .

  ** note ** : i 'm pretty sure this is skewed because lulzakes used to delete all of his posts randomly . 
  yeh , it does n't work , that 's why i could n't find it . 
  in fact , if you just want to catalogue my top posts ( anything over 1000 , let 's say ) there 's an upvote in it for you pal . 
  does n't make you sound like a troll , it 's a great question . 
  i 've only got an undergraduate degree in psych so if someone has more experience , i 'm happy to be corrected but there are a few reasons :, 
  1 ) it 's often a cry for help . 
  think of it this way , there are places you can cut yourself that are far less visible than your wrists . 
  2 ) some emotional pain is very hard to understand , even if you 're going through it . 
  also , some people do n't think that emotional upset is real or should be able to hurt you ( `` it 's my brain , i should have control '' ) . 
  physical pain is a way of making it more real . 
  it 's about `` now i 've got something worth crying about '' . 
  3 ) some cutters feel like they deserve it . 
  i 'm sure there are other reasons and i really hope others will add to this but they 're a few reasons off the top of my head . 
  i do n't have any textbooks with me because i 'm at work , sorry . 
  that 's a really good point . 
  in the book the brain that changes itself by dr norman doidge ( highly , highly recommend it ) he talks about the higher occurance of pain fetishes in those who had chronic pain when they were younger . 
  it 's almost like , if you can cognitively restructure your concept of pain , it makes it easier to cope with . 
  i assume it 's because you wrote your cv in all caps . 
  i 'm sorry if i implied that all cutters do so for those reasons . 
  as i said , there are several other motivations . 
  what i wanted to make clear is that for the overwhelming majority , it 's not about `` enjoying pain '' . 
  metareddit, 
  have you ever been chopping chillis and gone to the bathroom without washing your hands first ? 
  consider this a very important lesson then . 
  john stamos, 
  shit . 
  i used to work with a guy whose surname was `` badcock '' . 
  i shit you not . 
  thanks buddy , have one back . 
  because you do n't want to die . 
  that 's why you made this post . 
  if you really did n't want to be talked out of it , you never would 've said anything . 
  you know that how you feel in this moment will pass . 
  you know that there is help out there . 
  walk out your front door right now , with an ipod in your hand , and go for a walk . 
  tomorrow , i want you to do whatever it takes to get to a therapist . 
  your life is worth living , we both know it . 
  it 's time for you to be really , really brave and make sure you can have a future worth living . 
  i was really surprised , and delighted , to learn that some people think the term santorum has been around for ages and his name is just `` unfortaunte '' . 
  dan savage is my hero . 
  i do n't think you read what op wrote . 
  i can relate so well . 
  it 's agreed that there 's definitely a nature element of iq , there 's just no evidence that there 's a meaningful genetic difference between races that ca n't better be explained by environment . 
  are you following me around to downvote me and make comments ? 
  it 's creepy but kind of flattering , i guess . 
  and your evidence is ... 
  requiring people to be informed is n't democracy . 
  wow . 
  great find . 
  thanks pal, 
  my understanding is that kids are hitting puberty earlier because of greater levels of fat storage . 
  not my area of expertise so please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  jersey shore, 
  went for an std test , with my girlfriend , found out that my doctor was an old friend of my girlfriend 's dad . 
  oh , he then shoved a cotton swab inside my penis . 
  you 're a dick . 
  not at all .
