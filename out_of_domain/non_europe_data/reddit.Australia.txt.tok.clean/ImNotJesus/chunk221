  i have a few issues with that . 
  1 ) i never asked to be sacrificed for . 
  if i had the choice , i would have told god that i did n't want it . 
  i think it 's a horrible idea that someone else would suffer for my sins . 
  2 ) why must god be the path to enlightenment ? 
  3 ) when i say controlled , i do n't mean in a deterministic way , i mean a world where the rules are set up by a god . 
  what you 're doing right now , is redefining everything i say in a way that fits your perception of what christianity means . 
  god did n't take a bullet for me . 
  if you assume that the story of jesus is true ( i obviously do n't ) there are several large differences :, 
  1 ) god ** is ** the bullet . 
  he had no * need * to punish me and was simply stopping his own bullet that he chose to shoot . 
  2 ) no-one can or should be able to absolve you for your sins . 
  that 's an incredibly immoral idea . 
  why would i want to live in a world where god forgives bad deeds when people revere him ? 
  why should an amoral act counter an immoral act ? 
  beyond that , your answer that `` god is the realisation of reality '' is a bizarre point . 
  i asked you ** why ** i must seek god as a path and all you told me is that god is the path . 
  i can be more moral as an atheist than i can be as a christian . 
  turtle . 
  zero fucks given , hugely long life . 
  right but let 's think this through . 
  you 've told me that :, 
  a ) the way to truth is moving towards god, 
  b ) you ca n't know that it 's true unless you move to god, 
  c ) the bible tells you that you need faith ( i.e. , to ignore opposing evidence ) to know truth . 
  however , you also tell me that you ca n't have evidence that any of it is truth . 
  do you see how limiting that is ? 
  the only possible way you can act is to have faith and never question anything . 
  and the only reason you have to do that , is because you have faith that the thing that told you to have the faith is true . 
  in reality , there 's far more reason to think that the bible is n't true . 
  the world is far older than the bible suggests . 
  the adam and eve parable ca n't have happened because of evolution ( this takes out the doctrine of original sin ) . 
  also , there are plenty of things in the bible that i would n't ** want ** to believe came from a god . 
  do you want to believe that god creates homosexuals and then condemns them to hell for being who they are ? 
  do you want to believe that god condones stoning disobedient children ? 
  do you want to believe that god damned his own people to hell ( even though he created them in that way ) and the only way for him to fix it ( even though he makes the rules ) was to send himself down in human form to be tortured , thereby absolving people of the sin that he condemned them for ? 
  do you want to believe that the bible is the best set of rules we can come up with ? 
  i certainly do n't . 
  holy shit . 
  can i change my answer ? 
  you keep asserting things like this :, 
   god is the only answer of why because god is everything and god makes up our atoms and he is he physicality and ethereality of the human consciousness . 
  but your faith is the only reason for your faith . 
  beyond that , if the entire bible is made up of stories , how do you know which should be taken as true and which should be taken as stories ? 
  are the direct instructions true but the stories apocryphal ? 
  do you have to decide your own meaning ? 
  i do n't wish to offend you , i 'm just trying to understand you . 
  i 'm just being open and honest about what i do n't understand and i 'm hoping you can clarify it for me ( as i said i would be ) . 
  if you belief that almost all of the bible is story , how do you know which rules to follow ? 
  i live in australia where you call your mate a cunt and a cunt your mate . 
  so does that mean you do n't consider homosexuality a sin ? 
  how about masturbation ? 
  abortion ? 
  do you really believe that coveting is a sin when it 's something you ca n't control ? 
  you still have n't told me how you decide which rules are worth following and which are n't . 
  did you just decide that the overall message was love god , love each other and then you assume that any rules that do n't conform to that ( stoning gay people ) do n't count but ones that do conform do count ? 
  if so , under what authority do you take that stance ? 
  who are you to decide what god really means when he 's given you his books that clearly tell you what he expects of you ? 
  that 's what i keep trying to tell people . 
  `` i 'm humble , that 's why i like showing off '', 
  australia 's most famous criminal , ned kelly : ~ ~ `` such is life '' . ~ ~ `` ah , well , i suppose it has come to this . '', 
  apparently i 've been wrong all these years . 
  such is life was what he said in response to finding out that he would be hanged . 
  on the short walk before his execution , he also stopped by some flowers and casually remarked `` what a nice little garden '' . 
  my second favourite is : `` hey , fellas !, 
  how about this for a headline for tomorrow 's paper ? 
  ` french fries ' ! '', 
  it was spoken by james french before he was electrocuted . 
  third place goes to : `` tomorrow , i shall no longer be here '' - nostradamus , since it was his only correct prediction . 
  they 're over there . 
  their place is there . 
   unless we 're talking about an obscenely draconian tax system, 
  i do n't disagree that an attempt to get complete equality would lead to demotivation but i did n't think that was what metsa was trying to say . 
  it 's not an uncommon argument to say that the top few % should n't be taxed any higher because they 're the `` job creators '' and it would demotivate trying to earn more money . 
  i downvoted myself on my novelty a few times because the number was annoying me . 
  either way , with 26 , he clearly has been upvoting himself a lot . 
  funny thing is , reddit automatically fudges it anyway when you upvote yourself so it was n't just silly , it 's pointless . 
  go to sleep . 
  it 's really , really bad for you to be up for so long . 
  it 's anzac day for a few more hours so i have to be nice . 
  any other day you 're a sheep shagger . 
  serve the same social purpose ? 
  the point is that striving for money is a good but not great goal . 
  there are plenty of other ways to cultivate happiness though . 
  regular exercise does wonders for your brain . 
  so does meditation , good eating habits , having a challenging and rewarding career , good social ties etc. 
  all of our horrible nicknames for each other that i really , really hope i do n't call her in front of other people by mistake . 
  no , no . 
  clearly it 's much better to supplement his poor parenting with some cruel parenting because that always fixes everything . 
  you 'd hate to actually talk to her like a human being and try to teach her why it 's not okay . 
  instead let 's call her names on the internet and ask the lynch mob what 's the best way to punish her . 
  parenting at its finest , ladies and gentlemen . 
  yay what a great idea . 
  let 's supplement his poor parenting with some cruel parenting because that always fixes everything . 
  i remember that psych class we had where they said humiliating your daughter in public is guaranteed to make her a well-adjusted person . 
  [ easy choice ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/picturesofiansleeping/ ), 
  [ citation required ], 
  because i was n't making any claims . 
  he made the claim that `` reintegrative shaming '' is a successful tactic . 
  i made no claims of efficacy or truth .
