  being cruel to your child to `` teach her a lesson '' is never warranted . 
  there are a million other things he can do that would not only work better but not cause long-term harm to their relationship . 
  it was a frontpage post that was editted to include the phone number . 
  it was only up for about 5 minutes . 
  any drastic action ( removing a frontpage post ) will upset some people . 
  we stand by that rule as our most important and we have zero tolerance , especially when the use of personal information is malicious . 
  thanks !, 
  we really do try to modify the rules to make the subreddit the best we can . 
  there are some rules we 'll never get complete agreement on ( e.g. , medical posts ) but the personal information one is so important . 
  approved anyway . 
  do you sell pitchfork insurance ? 
  sorry , it 's been fixed . 
  * ahem . 
  * and who screwed it up in the first place ? 
  yes, 
  you do n't receive karma for self-posts, 
  `` taking a dump . 
  lol ! '', 
  the friendzone is n't a thing . 
  there is n't some magical barrier that goes up when you become friends with a girl . 
  she likes you in one way , not the other way . 
  she thinks of you as a friend because that 's what you are to her . 
  if you spend the whole time trying to work out how you can turn it into `` more '' , you wo n't be for long and you 're probably not the `` nice guy '' that you think you are . 
  if you find it difficult to be friends with a girl you 're attracted to , do n't be friends with here . 
  if you 're going to stay friends with her with the intention of convincing her she wants more , you 're going to be very frustrated 9/10 times . 
  sexual preference is n't binary . 
  you can be gay and find some girls attractive , or you can be bisexual . 
  if you have feelings for you , pursue it and you 'll find out . 
  i was listening to dan savage today and he had a call from this girl whose boyfriend liked to be ** kicked in the nuts ** . 
  nope . 
  nope . 
  nope, 
  apparently , this is the most common because of the proximity of the genitals and feet on the somatosensory cortex ( part of your brain that interprets sensation ) . 
  source : the brain that changes itself - norman doidge ( awesome book ), 
  right . 
  let 's think this through . 
  you 're having a close , emotional relationship where she can share parts of her life with you . 
  it 's obvious why she 'd want to have this and why ( i 'm assuming ) you like to have it as well . 
  the point is that , for you , when you feel close to a girl in that way and are attracted to her , you want more . 
  for her , she 's appreciating that she has this wonderful friend that she can be so close to . 
  it does n't need to be more to be special because it already is . 
  it actually is the most common . 
  as long as it 's anonymous i could n't care less . 
  unless i was finding something out i did n't want to . 
  [ you 're welcome ] ( http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2302/2264060604_eed7fc6a36.jpg ), 
  i figured it was a sub fetish . 
  i just thought that i could n't imagine having sex with sore nuts . 
  surely there 's an alternative !, 
  pretty much ? 
  realise that a $ 2500 lesson is better than him being dead right now . 
  incredibly stupid idea . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't possible but that 's what the evidence suggests is the most common . 
  the reason being , and i mentioned this in another comment , is the proximity of the feet/genitals in the somatosensory cortex . 
  do you have a link to the quote ? 
  do n't take a callous comment from a bad counsellor to be indicative of society as a whole . 
  tasuret enough . 
  you make one more novelty account trying to get him downvoted and i 'll have to ban your main one . 
  you 're misusing askreddit and no-one cares about your downvote war . 
  be an adult and call your manager , explaining the situation . 
  do n't be a dick about it . 
  ** warning : this post may contain science . 
  there 's a wonderful moral philosophy/psychology hypothetical . 
  you 're driving down the road in your brand new sports car and see a guy bleeding . 
  he 's clearly in trouble and his only chance is to get him to the hospital . 
  do you let him get in your car , knowing that it 'll do hundreds of dollars in damage to your seats ? 
  i 'm assuming everyone would say yes . 
  would you consider someone who said no a monster ? 
  now , you 've just received a letter from a charity organisation that is telling you that with your $ 300 , they could save a child 's life . 
  you may say yes or no but would you consider someone else a moral monster for saying no ? 
  there 's another interesting one called the [ trolley problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolley_problem ) that more of you would have heard of . 
  both are very useful in showing that we we do n't consider morality in a consequentialist way ( weighing up harm ) . 
  the distance from us and our actions makes a big difference . 
  the one you described is called the trolley problem ( although it 's normally just the 2nd/3rd question ) . 
  there has been some really cool research with it but it 's still in its infancy . 
  if you 're interested in the neurological research about it , look up some of josh greene 's videos . 
  exactly . 
  she does n't want friends , she wants attention . 
  it may not mean she 'll cheat , but i certainly would n't feel comfortable with this . 
  if guys are losing interest in her when she has a boyfriend , they were only trying to be friends so they could hook up with her and she should n't * want * to be friends with them anyway . 
  studies show that people are wonderfully good at rationalising why studies do n't apply to them . 
  also , it 's worth noting that these things are trends , they do n't mean that every single person will feel a certain way . 
  people are more likely to think that a is immoral to ignore but b is n't . 
  i never said that 100 % of people would feel that way . 
  that does n't make it esoteric , that makes it realistic . 
  pretty much , yeh . 
  social acclaim is a very important human drive . 
  we tend to do it in things that either make us distinctive ( look at my unusual talent ) or things that make us similar ( look at our same taste in movies ) . 
  that 's the whole point though . 
  if you 're a consequentialist ( a lot of people think of themselves as such ) , the equation is still the same $ 300 for a life . 
  but , it 's clear to see how close we are to the situation , how much responsibility we take , is a big factor . 
  josh greene 's ? 
  sweet !, 
  thanks, 
  exercise more . 
  no-one is so busy that they ca n't go for a 30 minute walk every day . 
  it 's incredibly good for your body ** and ** brain . 
  i expected roughly that many . 
  * puts fingers to temple *, 
  i 'm having a premonition . 
  i see ... good looking girls getting upvotes ...
