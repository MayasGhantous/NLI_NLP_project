  you linked back to this thread . 
  i clicked it 3 times before i worked out what was going on . 
  unless their surname is already wayne and that 's why they 're considering it . 
  bruce wayne wayne sounds worse . 
  the inseminator, 
  `` to treat her well and enjoy our time together '', 
  excess levels of dihydrogen monoxide in the lungs have lead to death . 
  actually , dopamine is the reward drug . 
  those behaviours have/had some benefit in survival ( even if the link is n't logical now ) . 
  it 's pretty easy to see how having sway over your tribe could lead to beneficial outcomes for your genes . 
  to be fair , you can pretty reliably clink on the comments section and see why the title/article was wrong in the top comment . 
  exactly . 
  you can get addicted to anything , really . 
  all you need is a reward mechanism ( think of all the wow addicts out there ) . 
  i would n't say i love it but it 's a funny enough show that i gladly watch it each week . 
  not every show has to be a comedy masterpiece to be worth watching . 
  it seems like the longer the post is around , the more your votes are decided by how much people agree with you , as opposed to how valuable what you have to say is . 
  i 've written out 4 paragraph arguments , filled with links to studies , about a controversial issue that did really well . 
  then it hits the frontpage and people do n't actually read what you say , they just up/downvote based on what opinion they already have . 
  being drunk is enough to do it . 
  nerves can be the problem too . 
  also , it just happens from time to time . 
  if he freaked out because of it , it would only make it worse . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  thanks pal . 
  i like you too, 
  the point is that from this information , we ca n't possibly know that . 
  what trozman was trying to point out is that saying something `` releases dopamine '' does n't actually tell you much beyond it 's a rewarding behaviour . 
  it could be activating the reward pathways for all sorts of reasons . 
  i 'm not saying power is n't a drug , i 'm saying there 's no evidence , based on that article , to suggest it is . 
  right , but saying that something releases dopamine adds nothing . 
  i 'm sure we could do some really fascinating studies into power ( and there have been some brilliant ones ) . 
  all i 'm saying is that saying it releases dopamine is his only evidence that it 's `` like a drug '' and as pointed out earlier , that described ** a lot ** of behaviours . 
  right but has he shown that it * does * release that much ? 
  i 'm not saying i disagree with you , i 'm just yet to see compelling enough evidence to make those claims . 
  i 'm willing to bet that you try ** way ** too hard when you 're into a girl but you 're just acting like yourself when you 're not . 
  / r/doesanybodyelse, 
  everyone else finds the world just as scary as you do . 
  you 'll be okay , just trust yourself and trust the people around you to still love you if you tell them that you do n't know how to cope . 
  the whole point is we 're complaining about the sensationalism . 
  we want science too , we 're just using jokes to show it . 
  i ca n't stand when people let the little things get to them . 
  it 's so frustrating to be around someone who finds reasons to be angry at the little things in life when there 's so much more to life . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v484/n7395/full/nature10981.html ) is a link to the relevant nature article for those who can get behind the paywall . 
  according to ndt , that means that if someone were to ejaculate in space , the zero gravity would mean that their body would shoot backwards as a result . 
  people kept getting me confused with someone else, 
  i was about 17 too . 
  my friend asked me why i believed in god and i could n't think of any reasonable answers . 
  why do n't you offer to pay for therapy since it 's a better long-term solution than medication . 
  because they 're scientists , not economists . 
  what the fuck ? 
  how am i trolling ? 
  i hope you 're trolling . 
  it 's incredibly unhealthy to think of your self as `` needing a spanking '' in a relationship . 
  i actually have a degree in psychology and will be a practising psychologist . 
  also , it 's not exactly `` out there '' advice to suggest therapy for depression . 
  it 's the usual treatment . 
  experience, 
  yes, 
  / r/creepy, 
  you definitely should n't try to force him , just encourage and support . 
  i know it 's tough to be in your position but you just need to trust that he 'll work it out in his own time . 
  keeping loving and supporting him and let him know you 'll do whatever it takes but that you trust him to work out what he needs/wants . 
  kinda ? 
  you need to realise that feeling sorry for yourself is actually your way of excusing inaction . 
  if you get up and go for a walk or meditate or do something positive every time you start to feel that way , you wo n't feel like it for very long . 
  that 's not to say some people are n't legitimately upset and you ca n't fix all problems like that but it does help you refocus on what you actually want . 
  double jeapordy does n't apply to civil cases . 
  the reason they 're doing it is that there 's a different burden of proof in a civil case . 
  and stress is not conducive to boners, 
  we 're sorry that some of our representatives are legitimately creepy and dangerous . 
  please do n't judge us for that . 
  mindfulness meditation has had incredible research results recently in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms by reducing activity in the amygdala ( the part of your brain responsible for anxiety ) . 
  go to itunes and search for ucla mindfulness , they 've got some guided meditations you can try, 
  if you 've told him it makes you feel uncomfortable and he still does it , that 's a problem , irrespective of whether you 're overreacting or not . 
  it sounds like he does n't have much regard for your feelings . 
  having a finger jam under something heavy or stubbing your toe . 
  sorry , what 's a neutral oil ? 
  that you need to put your pants back on . 
  i want to open a fish and chip shop . 
  i have no passion for fish and chips , i just want an excuse to call it `` the codfather '', 
  i 'm going to publish a psychology book ( or several ) one day . 
  i love teaching people about it and i love the idea that i 'd be able to educate so many people . 
  i was in a car accident where i hit a pedestrian ( at pace ) with my side mirror . 
  if i was a second earlier , he would 've ended up with much more than a bruise . 
  edit : took out the freudian . 
  time for my favourite joke : do you know what a freudian slip is ? 
  it 's when you say one thing but mean your mother . 
  can not unsee, 
  hey , those things are mysterious as hell before you see one a few times . 
  i 'm curious to know if you thought about it a lot ? 
  like did you come up with a reason why in your head ? 
  no ma'am . 
  i comment a lot and have a distinctive username so i 'm sorry if it appears like i 'm stalking you . 
  you need to split hypnosis and hypnotherapy . 
  stage hypnosis is essentially bullshit . 
  there 's no altered state of consciousness and it works on a combination of psychological factors ( it 's worth noting that many will remember what happened and say that they were `` just going along with it '' ) . 
  hypnotherapy is different . 
  it is possible to hypnotise someone into an altered state of consciousness that is objectively measurable and verifiable . 
  there is * some * clinical use for it and it 's essentially a form of guided meditation .
