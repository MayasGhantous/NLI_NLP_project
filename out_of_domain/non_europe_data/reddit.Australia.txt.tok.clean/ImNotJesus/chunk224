  edit : just remembered there was an askscience post about it . 
  find out more [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kd87f/how_does_hypnosis_work/ ), 
  because they signal sufficient oestrogen during puberty which suggests an adequately developed reproductive system . 
  oooo so sexy . 
  you 're welcome . 
  becoming a mod of askreddit . 
  i now have no life . 
  seriously though , changing university courses to study psychology . 
  i 'm so much happier now . 
  enjoy most of the time . 
  if you say all of the time they 'll think you 're a suck-up . 
  every time i use the mouse, 
  just about every conversation with my girlfriend . 
  do n't listen to her , call the fucking cops . 
  no you wo n't, 
  nobody really understands . 
  just stay away . 
  there 's no reason to say he had to be alive when the cat was born . 
  it sounds like you need to talk this through with a psych ** ologist ** and not strangers on the internet . 
  this is something you should be talking to a professional about , not strangers on reddit . 
  maybe ... it 's the wind . 
  well , that makes sense , except logic . 
  surely talking to the bank would make more sense than asking us, 
  it takes a lot more than `` reading it in a book '' to be a psychiatrist/psychologist . 
  talk to a doctor about this , not strangers on the internet , you dingus . 
  sports management = business of sport, 
  sports sceince = science of sport, 
  oh god ... what if he reverses the vectors . . he 's going to backtrace it ... 
  run, 
  uhh ... no ... definitely not ... you 're safe ... 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
  i already told you when you messaged the mods that your posts were removed for not fitting within the subreddit guidelines . 
  billy joel - vienna, 
  it 's probably not for everyone but if you 're an intelligent person who ca n't work out why their life is n't perfect yet , you should give it a listen . 
  unless you agreed not to , you 're totally overreacting . 
  there 's not really enough information to say either way . 
  that being said , if you 're not getting enough attention and he is n't responding to you asking for more , that 's a valid reason to leave him . 
  oh , that 's because i was reading the new queue when your post came up , i removed it within a minute . 
  okay . 
  no , since they 're both bullshit . 
  this one time , i thought i saw a ghost , turns out that ghosts do n't actually exist and i was wrong . 
  edit : did you read in your horoscope that you should downvote me ? 
  maybe i 'll do a voodoo dance to get rid of the evil spirits causing the downvotes . 
  prostitution . 
  i 'm a good person . 
  i make an active effort to improve the lives of those around me and am working towards a career where i will help change many lives for the better . 
  the internet . 
  it 's revolutionised the way we do business , learn , spend recreation , socialise , shop and way , way more . 
  the printing press changed the world by allowing many more people than ever to find knowledge . 
  the internet means that all people can find almost all knowledge at almost any time . 
  yeh , if you think about it , this is partially responsible for many of the others . 
  the longer people live healthily , the more chance that they 'll invent something that changes the world . 
  go and give blood . 
  the value for effort ratio is phenomenal . 
  take a 30 minute walk everyday . 
  it 's not just great for your body , it 's also incredibly good for your mind . 
  it 's not about the dollar value , it 's about contributing . 
  me and my so spend heaps on each other for presents , we love spoiling each other . 
  however , if she was n't working , i 'd spend way less on her . 
  if she 's 19 and already not working , that 's a problem . 
  you 're allowed to expect her to be a somewhat equal partner . 
  hard to say at this stage but you should 've talked about it a lot more between now and then . 
  do you guys live together ? 
  what 's going to happen when you do ? 
  will she pay bills/rent/mortgage ? 
  i can because i 've got my degree almost completely online ( only a few mandatory classes ) . 
  i also spend my spare time learning from different colleges around the world ( berkeley , yale , harvard and oxford all have brilliant open source psychology material available ) . 
  the amount of time i save studying online means i get more time for recreation . 
  agreed . 
  send a message to the admins , they do n't want this happening either . 
  ** important note : ** do n't press the ` report ' button though , that goes to the mods who ca n't do anything about this issue . 
  except that it appears several redditors seem to believe it . 
  some people think truth matters . 
  if you think that all that matters to you is your subjective experience , what white667 said should have no impact on your , because he 's talking about ** objective ** truth . 
  it is n't superior to state objective fact . 
  it 's superior to say that your personal opinion should be valued * more * than objective fact . 
  also , if you had any understanding of logic , you 'd understand that it is the requirement of those making an assertion that something is real to prove so , not those asserting it does n't . 
  he is perfectly reasonable in saying that as no-one has provided significant prove to the counter . 
  that 's a false analogy . 
  there 's a difference between saying that a truth claim is incorrect and saying that one subjective preference is better than another . 
  i have no idea what that is , sorry . 
  i just named myself this to clear up confusion . 
  people kept getting me confused with my gardner . 
  god i wish i was clever enough to be making that reference . 
  that 's fucking brilliant , i 'm using it from now on . 
  i think the problem here is n't that they think you 're gay , it 's that you have n't been in their life at all so they have no reason to think otherwise . 
  it seems like they 're actually being incredibly supportive . 
  i believe they 're currently looking into the issue . 
  i onced saved africa by sharing a video on facebook . 
  your move , trapped_in_reddit . 
  as a result of spending all of my work/study ** and ** recreation time typing and using a mouse , i now get bad finger pains in my index finger . 
  the physiotherapist essentially told me i had to quit reddit . 
  then you 'll see , that it is not the upvote that bends , it is only yourself . 
  nope , just a very naughty boy . 
  apparently it 's a result of the nerves in my right arm being too short , predisposing me to the issue . 
  hear *, 
  i 'm guessing she means that if you walk up to her at a bar or something , you 're clearly only interested in her looks because you have no idea about her personality . 
  alternatively , she 's an attention seeking moron . 
  can we please , please not respond to this with the same holocaust pun thread . 
  this was a great joke , let 's just leave it there .
