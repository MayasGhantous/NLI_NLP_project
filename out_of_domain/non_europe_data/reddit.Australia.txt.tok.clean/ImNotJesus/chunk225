  mods do n't have special access to the admins, 
  he did n't ... 
  he feels as if the rest of the u.s. feels irrelevant ** to him ** . 
  please tell me you gave him a hell of a tip . 
  edit : so proud of you reddit . 
  no-one has replied with `` just the tip '' yet . 
  helps avoid spam, 
  the votes are fudged to help prevent against spam bots ( do n't ask me , i do n't understand it ) . 
  however , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all ) you go . 
  buy them a good bottle of wine from the year they were born and give it to them when they 're 18 . 
  if you buy something good , it could be worth 10s of thousands by then . 
  posts of value get upvotes , posts of no value get downvotes . 
  making it harder for people who post things of no value to post stop spam bots . 
  it 's fairly simple . 
  looking through your comment history , i do n't think people are downvoting you because of their personal opinion . 
  you 're fairly aggressive and negative with all of your comments . 
  maybe try being a bit nicer ? 
  you come off as very hostile . 
  okay, 
  well , yeah , there 's no point cellaring a $ 10 wine for 18 years . 
  i 'm as surprised and excited as you are, 
  there 's nothing illegal about stammering . 
  have a heart , you monster . 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3p0w5q/ ), 
  me and my girlfriend have agreed that i 've started to become blonde , not grey . 
  what if you 're 25 and getting both ? 
  here 's a protip for talking to ** anyone ** who is being emotional . 
  you need to listen to their emotion first , before you can listen to them being rational . 
  ask them what 's going on , let them vent their feelings . 
  when that 's done , you can have a rational discussion with someone . 
  learning that has been the biggest help to my relationship . 
  the way it was put to me is , you have to take a turn having the conversation in their language ( emotional ) , before you can have one in yours ( rational ) . 
  i would n't because i 'm an adult . 
  hear hear !, 
  dogs are so much more affectionate . 
  cats are assholes who make you work for everything . 
  if i wanted that , i 'd still be with my ex-wife . 
  i think this is more fringe than most people like to joke about . 
  if you actually had an election , just with redditors voting , obama would win in a landslide . 
  i completely agree with not attacking people 's religions but my feeling is that you play by the rules the other person sets . 
  if they think the bible should be able to decide social policy , it becomes fair game to attack the ** ideas ** ( in the same way i would if they said that anything i believe to be antiquated would be attacked ) . 
  if they say it 's just their personal belief and it makes them happy , i 'll never say an ill word . 
  there are two types of threads on askreddit ; information threads and story threads . 
  i 'm okay with both . 
  okay , well that 's one . 
  a few million to go . 
  stds . 
  i almost have bingo . 
  it happened when i was on holiday in bali as a 13 year old . 
  i was at this club hanging out with a group of older guys . 
  one of these guys ( who i 'd only recently met ) was an ** incredible ** dancer . 
  i asked him how he became such a good dancer and he told me this : `` every time i go dancing , i wait and watch for a little while . 
  i pick out the best dancer and steal his best move , adding it to my repertoire . '', 
  in that moment , i thought `` wow , how cool would that be if you could do it with all traits '' and since that moment i 've tried to . 
  i assume that everyone is better than me at at least one thing and i could learn a skill from them . 
  it 's been so valuable . 
  either that or she has the weirdest tan line on her arm in history . 
  ironic christian rock, 
  i was trying to clear up some confusion . 
  people kept getting me confused with my gardener . 
  what advice are you looking for ? 
  it sounds like he 's depressed and has been diagnosed as such . 
  your job right now is just to be there for him and try to support him . 
  if you can , get him to go for walks with you ( or other exercise you normally do ) . 
  beyond that , just hope he 's getting treatment . 
  do n't you see how important this is andrew ? 
  two people on the same website that millions of people use have the same stein . 
  what are the odds ? 
  next you 're going to tell me that some of my friends at university also use that google website . 
  just keep trying and do n't be offended if he 's resistant . 
  he really does want you to keep trying , even if it does n't feel like it right now . 
  your right . 
  their so annoying . 
  you know that old cliche of the dad forcing his kid to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes ? 
  this is you 're therapy . 
  go to the police anyway , get everything on the record . 
  it sounds like there 's enough for a restraining order . 
  however , the most important thing right now is sole custody . 
  start making a police record . 
  i 'm going to guess ... american ? 
  just give them to her , she can throw them out if she wants . 
  luckily scientific evidence is worth more than anecdotal evidence , especially when it 's so subjective . 
  this is true . 
  the biggest meta-analysis on it suggests that it is n't just a great way to a lot of psychological damage to your child , it 's actually not a very useful behaviour modification tool as it raises `` immediate compliance '' but does n't change behaviour long-term . 
  however , reddit is remarkably pro corporal punishment so my post will be horrifically downvoted shortly . 
  take better care of the environment , fight dogmatism in all forms . 
  did you finish ? 
  how long was the call and how long did it take till you were de-bonered ? 
  what % finished were you when he called ? 
  i think of it as :, 
  mystery % mystery % mystery % mystery % mystery % mystery % 99 %, 
  why must meaning have a purpose ? 
  ca n't it just mean because that 's our experience of it ? 
  you do realise that within the next week , thousands of redditors are now going to try this right ? 
  few words can describe the satisfaction of taking a dump with the door open . 
  because we all evolved from the same source and there 's value in being able to understand each other 's expressions . 
  there 's a lot of research on this stuff , mainly by paul ekman . 
  it 's actually a really important scientific question and source of much research . 
  if you 're interested in the topic , uc berkeley have psychology lectures available on itunes . 
  if you listen to the social cognition lecture series it 's covered in that .
