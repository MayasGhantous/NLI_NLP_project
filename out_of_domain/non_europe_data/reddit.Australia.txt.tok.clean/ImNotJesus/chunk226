  you 're not being unreasonable , it just sounds like you should n't be in a relationship with each other . 
  if you 're not okay with dating a smoker and she 's not oaky with quitting , you just should n't be together . 
  no-one can answer that but you buddy . 
  the only rule is this , if you accept it and date her anyway , you 're not allowed to resent her for it .

  well it 's not quite that simple , it really depends on the type of disorder . 
  a schizophrenic may be aware that they 're schizophrenic but will ** generally ** believe their delusion to be real . 
  conversely , there are several types of severe psychopathology where the sufferer will have insight into their condition . 
  it makes a really big difference for the types of treatment they can receive ( e.g. , you ca n't really give cbt to someone with no insight ) . 
  on the flip side , you can have disorders that are not generally as severe , where the sufferer has little to no insight because of cognitive deficit or simply denial . 
  ** tl ; dr ** mental disorders are varied and complex . 
  right , that makes more sense in context . 
  as you can imagine , a big part of ptsd is coming to terms with what happened . 
  if the sufferer is defiant that `` nothing is wrong '' to an obsessive level , it 's ( potentially ) a bad sign .

  have you had your booster shots ? 
  no matter what the movie/tv show , no matter what the context , if a child is sad or mistreated , i get terrible chills . 
  no sir , it 's to clear up confusion . 
  people kept getting me confused with my gardener . 
  my sincerest apologies , ma'am . 
  when did he say that we should outlaw anything ? 
  what he 's saying is that certain ideas should n't get immunity from scrutiny just because they come from a religious source . 
  i do n't care what your belief is , if you tell me that it 's `` immoral '' to be gay , your ideas deserve to be ridiculed . 
  i think the other way . 
  i think we should be ** much ** harsher on parents of obese kids/teens . 
  if your kid is * that * overweight , you deserve to be arrested for child abuse . 
  those learned behaviours can take years and years of hard work to rectify . 
  parents who do n't vaccinate or decide to use alternative medicine on their children should have them taken away . 
  i 'm all for freedoms but this should n't an area of opinion or personal preference . 
  til our bacon is weird, 
  a delicious peni ... 
  uhhh, 
  except that they have no training or expertise . 
  what if a kid is in need of real psychological support and the chaplain is n't able to see that ? 
  perhaps we should give them roles as school nurses too since the kids feel so comfortable with them . 
  good to know . 
  i 've got some odds tags out there, 
  / r/happy, 
  i got banned because i said that it 's objectively easier for a woman to get laid than a man . 
  they took that to mean that i was suggesting that all women should have sex with as many men as possible as a way of becoming popular . 
  i think you 're confused . 
  i have freedom of religion which means i have the freedom to force my religious views on you and abortion is against my religion . 
  edit : in all seriousness , the rights i 'm most worried about are actually the unborn child . 
  you know what is n't fair to a child ? 
  being born to parents who do n't want it , are n't ready to take proper care of it and do n't have the means to do so anyway . 
  how about `` pro-lifers '' start spending a fraction of the money they spend on `` pro-life '' charities on taking care of kids that are actually born into terrible situations . 
  then i 'd give them some respect . 
  no-one said anything about killing children . 
  knale was saying that ( s ) he supports the right for a woman to choose whether or not to kill her foetus . 
  on a related note , i 'm going to need you to stop wearing mixed blend fabric . 
  it 's explicitly forbidden in the bible . 
  i hate that term . 
  who is n't `` pro-life '' ?

  absofuckinglutely, 
  when did i say that they ** all ** were ? 
  you seem to be suggesting there 's a piece of information that i need to know . 
  please ... enlighten me . 
  note : if you mention autism or mercury , i 'll simply not reply . 
  try `` yoga nidra '' meditation . 
  ucla have some free guided meditations available through itunes . 
  it 's great for your brain ( they do research on it there ) and will help you relax . 
  also , you 're going to get a lot of replies that simply say `` fap '' . 
  that 's just mean, 
  i do n't know but i 'd watch it, 
  because they 're putting their lives at risk . 
  america fetishizes freedoms . 
  it informs a lot of the biggest strengths and weaknesses . 
  the bit with the snake at the end was insane . 
  no problems . 
  * do n't * talk to them . 
  problem solved . 
  i outgrew mine . 
  you 're confusing temporal correlation with causation . 
  a common cause for quack medicine belief .

  these types of posts will be removed . 
  i would 've tried much harder . 
  i coasted through on intelligence and thought i was so smart at the time for being able to do it . 
  once i got into university , i wished that i 'd learned study habits . 
   i would have, 
  lesson # 1, 
  in honour of your fine ninjaing , i 'll leave my comment and look like a dick . 
  santorum and ndt ( the respective leaders ) would end up declaring war on each other . 
  losing virginity . 
  like , it was good , but i expected it to be life-changing . 
  good . 
  do n't make it up to be a bigger thing than it needs to be . 
  sex is fun and sex is especially nice when you do it with someone you love but it becomes much less fun when you start to think of it as the be all and end all of experience . 
  til i 'm famous . 
  i told you i 'd amount to something mum . 
  my 6 minutes of inflated ego are now over . 
  it 's easier to tell them you 've been lying for 5 months than it is telling them that you 've been lying for 6 months .
