  enjoyment, 
  foot fetishes are a special case . 
  it 's believed that they 're the most common fetish because the part of your brain that sorts touch information ( the somatosensory cortex ) is layed out in a way that different parts or the cortex refer to different body parts . 
  as it turns out , the feet are next to the genitals and it 's believed that `` cross-wiring '' causes the fetish .

  as someone who is just about to start cycling , thanks !, 
  trying . 
  i was one of those asshole high schoolers that thought it was cooler if i never tried for anything . 
  in hindsight , i know it was just a way of making sure i could n't ever fail . 
  the last 2 years of my life i 've started fighting for what i care about and i 'm 10x happier than i 've ever been . 
  i fail more now , because i try much more , the only difference is it does n't hurt . 
  you also reddit badly . 
  the other mods got mad at me when i used my flair for joke purposes :( . 
  it 's the only reason i became a mod anyway . 
  why did someone downvote those 2 comments of yours ? 
  do you have people that just downvote you on sight ? 
  i upvoted both ( for justice ), 
  i think never leaving askreddit has saved me from that . 
  89000 of my comment karma comes from askreddit haha . 
  til !,

  we convinced a friend to snort salt . 
  of course , he was hesitant so he did n't sniff hard enough and most of it sat in his nose , making it 20x worse than it would 've been . 
  my worst : eating a handful of pepper . 
  puked instantly . 
  so you took her hair out of her ponytail , gave her contacts and found out she was stunningly beautiful ? 
  he never learned to count,

  what the fuck dude ? 
  that 's not okay . 
  seek help . 
  i 'm 25 and yes . 
  i make a groaning noise when i sit down and am very happy if i 'm asleep by 10 . 
  making ? 
  here 's a great rule a thumb : there 's never a way you 're supposed to feel about something . 
  there 's what you feel and what 's objectively true . 
  what you feel right now tells us about what 's going on in your head . 
  you want to feel in control and do n't want to see your parents in this light . 
  however , it ** is n't true ** . 
  it 's very common for kids to blame themselves and completely untrue . 
  ** here 's what you do ** : you ** have ** to tell your parents that you 're struggling with this . 
  if they ca n't provide the support you need because they 're going through their own thing , tell them that you need to ** talk to a psychologist ** to help you work through this process . 
  if they do n't pm me and i 'll give you some stuff you can do , or simply listen to what 's going on for you . 
  tl ; dr this is definitely not your fault and you have the right to ask for help through this process . 
  ... and that 's how i ended up with a 14 inch man playing the piano . 
  my favourite part is that he equates paying his taxes with him walking up and taking $ 500 out of an innocent person 's pocket . 
  by that i assume that he does n't use any services provided by the government including their roads . 
  yes , as long as your opinion is the one that the masses agree with . 
  otherwise , you 're fucked . 
  my experience is that you 're often okay until the post is an hour old . 
  if it starts to get popular after that , people downvote on opinion ** much ** more . 
  posting other people 's personal information will result in a ban . 
  i think that you 're thinking of serotonin . 
  have you ever tried meth ? 
  wow dude that 's a seriously fucked up situation that you 're in no way capable of fixing . 
  you need to get out of there and speak to a counsellor , that 's really not okay . 
  apparently i need to review my psychopathology notes , been too long . 
  thanks . 
  drinks are on me !, 
  yo momma 's so fat she 's at a high risk of diabetes and really should think about a lifestyle change . 
  you know it 's a 90s joke when it 's got a beeper . 
  i have n't met her either but by all reports she 's quite overweight and not particularly bright . 
  i think you 'll find that categorises 99.9 % of his comments . 
  also , if you annoy him , he just starts calling everyone a faggot . 
  it 's quite funny to be honest . 
  not at all , buddy . 
  i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to achieve here . 
  i have no ill-will towards you beyond thinking you 're just not particularly witty . 
  attacking my degree is fairly odd but okay . 
  the worst thing they can do is say `` yes '' , when they do n't really want to and then go on a couple of awkward dates with you when you think things are better than they are . 
  was there ever an indian burial ground on this lot ? 
  asbestos, 
  the ** entire ** point of the thread is that people were getting upvoted for ** unusual ** and ** taboo ** behaviours . 
  why would you assume that it means they 're now common ? 
  seems bizarre to me . 
  yes , there are not only several federal agents on reddit but they 're also privy to national secrets ** and ** they want to risk their job by telling you over the internet , with the only prize being upvotes . 
  yup . 
  this is going places .

  i listened to a song about irony that listed nothing ironic . 
  wow, 
  a lot more people would be living below the poverty line because there are more people who want jobs and do n't have them . 
  you 're confused . 
  my wow was my way of saying `` wow , you basically ignore the lack of evidence and just substitute it for your own opinion , i should probably back out of this conversation because my experience is that people who ignore scientific evidence ( or lackthereof ) are n't really worth discussing scientific issues with '' . 
  1 ) no because it is n't that simple . 
  less people have money = less people spending money = less jobs . 
  2 ) you 're assuming that there 's a perfect balance of jobs and people where it would reach a balance point where people are earning enough, 
  3 ) the poverty line is n't decided by me , it 's a figure used for statistics . 
  the minimum wage in america is far lower than most countries ( especially considering how abhorrent the health care system is ), 
  moot , you dingus . 
  also , you 're the one making the spurious claim , based on no evidence . 
  i did n't say it is , but abolishing it will lead to less wealth overall . 
  while waiting in line for the shower at a music festival , a woman was standing in front of me and brushing her teeth . 
  she turned to me , took her toothrbush out of her mouth and pokes me in the stomach with the back of it saying `` a bit tubby there are n't we ? 
  pffft typical apathetic white mother '' . 
  i just stood there silently .
