  never play that person again . 
  it 's the fight club corollary . 
  i would give marks for showmanship, 
  or has he trained you with chores ? 
  struggling to find a study on iq and happiness but did find this on emotional intelligence :, 
   ** summary of the study **, 
   this study investigates the relationship of emotional intelligence ( ei ) characteristics , such as perception , control , use and understanding of emotions , with physical and psychological health . 
  in the first study , 365 individuals filled in measures of ei and general health . 
  it was hypothesized that ei would be negatively associated with poor general health . 
  in the second study , 212 working adults completed the same measure of ei and another measure , which apart from the standard information regarding physical and psychological health , provided also information about other health related behaviours , such as smoking , drinking , and exercising . 
  it was also hypothesized that ei would negatively correlate with smoking and drinking and positively correlate with exercising . 
  the findings confirmed both hypotheses and provided further support on the claims that there is a relationship between ei and health functioning . 
  additionally , in a series of hierarchical regression analyses the unique contribution of each of the ei scales on the overall health score were investigated . 
  the findings are discussed in the context of the importance of emotional competences on health and personal lifestyle , while implications for practice and directions for future research are proposed .

   ** findings **, 
   the \ufb01ndings of the current study provide further support on the claims that there is a negative relationship between increased levels of ei and low, 
  physical and psychological health , although the, 
  nature of the research design used in the present, 
  study does not allow af\ufb01rmative conclusions on, 
  the causality of the relationship . 
  so basically , i ca n't answer your iq-related question but if you have high * emotional * intelligence you 're far likelier to be happy and healthy . 
  as a fun little aside ; i also found an article claiming that high intelligence correlates with good sperm count . 
  score !, 
  i met a really nice woman because of masturbating . 
  sorry , typo , that was meant to say policewoman . 
  who is that black guy ? 
  he kind of looks like michael jackson, 
  i shot the sheriff but that damn deputy got away . 
  tl ; dr please, 
  lnil that pavlov was a sick fuck . 
  did you know that he operated on small children to put saliva measuring instruments in their mouth before doing similar experiments on them ? 
  he would drop cookies out of a tube into a baby strapped in then measured the responses . 
  make it into small attainable goals with rewards . 
  for example , i 'll say to myself that i get to watch a 1/2 hour show after each page i finish , lunch after i finish my intro etc. 
  ( relevant : i 'm a guy ) when i was in primary school we had a substitute teacher . 
  she went around the class asking everyone what their name is . 
  i answered ` lucy ' with a completely straight face . 
  she said : `` come on what 's your real name ? '', 
  so i used my greatness skill at that age and started fake crying , saying `` what 's wrong with the name lucy '' . 
  she felt so bad that she let me do whatever i wanted for the rest of the day ( including moving my desk next to the computers in the back of the room and just sitting there playing computer while she was talking ) . 
  i kissed a girl and i liked it, 
  really not that much closer . 
  there 's still a fuckload to work out until we make the few next big steps . 
  if you put that $ 1 trillion into scientific research and education the difference would be incredible .

  how hard did your friend hit the ball ? 
  obviously just adjust the goals and rewards then . 
  people that think that everything is a conspiracy and science is all just about your agenda . 
  two and they both changed my life :, 
  1 ) the day i quit wow, 
  2 ) the day i quit weed, 
  first blowjob ranks very highly for me , was older than i 'd like to admit . 
  i was super , super drunk and she was a few years older than me ( and had a tongue ring ) so i 'm assuming she 'd had practice . 
  she also told me she was in med school , in hindsight i 'm not sure if it was true . 
  i used to get that when i had a shaved head . 
  yes it may feel nice but it 's still my personal space . 
  a slide from my bedroom that goes into an indoor pool, 
  what 's the hardest part of roller blading ? 
  telling your parents that you 're gay . 
  that 's such a weird coincidence , i ** just ** made the same face as i looked at it . 
  what sort of meditation do you do ? 
  i 'm just starting mindfulness since i 've seen some studies that showed great results . 
  thoughts ? 
  it 's a terrible shame that very few people will read this because it 's magnificent . 
  i actually think your `` too much knowledge '' one that got downvoted was better than your one that got votes . 
  clearly a lie . 
  girls do n't poo, 
  not all atheists are on r/atheism, 
  i almost died from my circumcission and have a nice big scar all the way around my cock because of it that i assume reduces my sensitivity even more than a circumcision alone does . 
  yes , i think genital mutilation should be illegal in all forms . 
  by creating a life with meaning . 
  accepting the absurdity that we exist allows you to accept that your life has meaning because it has meaning to you . 
  make yourself happy , impact on those around you and create things bigger than yourself ( contribute to a field , build something people appreciate , give charity etc. ), 
  edit : that 's the very short version just let me know if you want more info or for me to explain anything , i could write you several essays on this topic . 
  dreams/nightmares are an expression of your unconscious mind . 
  try to work out what the dreams represent or speaking to a therapist about them , you may find it will help . 
  dream analysis that says x always equals y is n't very useful . 
  the important thing is what those elements mean to you . 
  take each part and try to work out what they represent and then relate it back to something that 's making you feel anxious at the moment . 
  what does an army training mission entail ? 
  do you know anyone in the army ? 
  what do you think of people in the army ? 
  are you currently training for anything ? 
  what does a bomb signify to you ? 
  it makes me think of something running out of time or death and destruction . 
  what comes to mind ? 
  what do you think of about not being able to leave a car ? 
  who 's telling you that you ca n't leave ? 
  does it mean you feel trapped ? 
  does it mean you do n't know how to escape etc. 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that what 's important is what everything means to you . 
  it 's best to talk to someone who knows you well about it and just ask them to listen ( or pm me if you 're really worried about it and we can have a proper conversation about it ) .

  close reddit . 
  i 'm yet to do it successfully ( he says while listening to a lecture ) but apparently it works . 
  it gets used on reddit a fair bit but ... 
  holocaust jokes are n't funny anne frankly i wo n't stand for it .
