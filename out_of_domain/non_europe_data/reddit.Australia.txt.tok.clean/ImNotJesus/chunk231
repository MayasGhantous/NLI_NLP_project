  try to see if anyone in your area uses act , mbsr or psychodynamic psychotherapy . 
  also , you should never have to worry about sounding weird to your therapist . 
  i guarantee you , you 're not the weirdest client they 've had . 
  just listening to you , i wonder if you 'd get some benefit out of trying meditation . 
  it 's been proven in a tonne of studies to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms plus a bunch of other benefits . 
  ucla do a lot of the research on it and they have some free guided meditations you can try . 
  try one of [ these ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) . 
  it will be hard at first but that means you 're doing a good job . 
  do n't worry if your mind wanders , that 's the whole point . 
  all you need to do is gently remember what you want to be focussing on and regain your focus . 
  if you lose it again , do n't get frustrated , just do the same thing . 
  if you do that for 5 minutes every day , i guarantee it 'll change your life . 
  it does n't seem like you are . 
  go back and talk to the psychologist again . 
  after all these years you still remember it all so clearly , it tells you something about how deeply it touched something in you, 
  best of luck . 
  if you need any help/support , feel free to pm me . 
  it may not get you in trouble but it sounds like it 's a really bad idea . 
  you know she has tried to kill herself so you know she 's clearly unhappy and not coping . 
  do you think criticising her will help or hurt the situation right now ? 
  here 's the thing about psychodynamic psychotherapy ( the modern version of freud 's psychoanalysis ) , it works . 
  it seems to work just as well as cbt and mindfulness based stress reaction and act and ipt for ** some ** conditions . 
  the research seems to suggest that there are certain elements of the therapy itself that are universal between therapies and actually accounts for about 3/4 of the effect of therapy . 
  there is some value to self-therapy i would suggest . 
  gaining insight is valuable . 
  in psychodynamic therapy , whether your interpretation is `` right '' or not does n't really matter , what matters is self-dicovery and assigning meaning to life experience . 
  i would think that you could get value through structured self-therapy ( there are lots of books on how to use cbt or act on yourself ) but certainly not as good as using a real therapist . 
  so , in theory , if you want sweet food without the calories , you want foods that have shorter chain sugars because they 're proportionally more sweetness for the calories ? 
  it definitely is n't an appropriate tool for diagnosis . 
  however , very little of therapy is diagnosis . 
  different types of therapy use different method to change underlying issues that cause symptoms . 
  for example , cbt is about changing how you relate to your thoughts since thoughts . 
  alternatively , act is about accepting how you feel and what you can/can ' t have . 
  psychodynamic is a little different as it 's about looking back through your childhood ( and more recent times too ) to see what the causes of your current behaviours are . 
  for example , x ca n't trust anyone in relationships because he did n't feel loved by his parents ( super-cliched example ) . 
  that sort of self-discovery can be done through insight alone but is ** far ** more efficacious with a professional therapist guiding the process . 
  well , for some conditions it does definitely matter but in general they have fairly similar efficacy . 
  in my personal opinion , different types of therapy appeal to different patients in different conditions . 
  there are some cb therapists who ** only ** know how to use cbt and they 're doing their patients a disservice . 
  some patient 's do n't have enough insight to use cbt ( how can you ask someone to change their thought patterns when they have limited understanding of them ? ) . 
  most therapists these days learn several different methods and will use them in different contexts . 
  the authenticity is n't actually as important as you think . 
  it 's like with dream analysis ( which is still used today by some ) ; applying meaning to your dream is almost certainly false in a scientific sense . 
  however , the meaning you apply has innate value because it suggests underlying thoughts . 
  for example , if i have a dream where i 'm flying and then fall and interpret it as `` i 'm fearful that if i start trying to reach my goals i 'll fall '' it does n't really matter if that 's the actual cause of the dream , what matters is that you 're applying meaning that is relevant to you and in that process seeing how you feel . 
  from a scientific sense , it 's clearly wrong . 
  from a therapeutic sense , it gives insight . 
  the authenticity does n't matter , really . 
  let 's look at dream analysis . 
  i have this dream where i 'm flying and then i fall to the ground . 
  i may then analyse that and go `` i think it 's about me trying to strive for my goals and falling to hit the ground , maybe that 's what i 'm anxious about . '', 
  from a scientific perspective , that analysis is certainly wrong . 
  from a therapeutic perspective , you 've just gained insight into your own motivations . 
  it 's not true because that 's what the dream actually meant , it 's true because you 've applied your own meaning to it that relates to underlying states . 
  yes, 
  firstly , you certainly can have a meaningful relationship without sex but you are missing out on a key part of the relationship , that 's a reality . 
  ** however ** , i think you 're wrong about losing weight . 
  for one , the dynamics of how it all works when you lose weight is very different . 
  you can get much closer . 
  secondly , have a look at your cock right now . 
  notice how there 's a bunch of fat at the base of it ? 
  as you lose weight , that will disappear and more cock will magically appear from below . 
  lastly , you can certainly please a woman without your cock . 
  have you got lots of practice using your fingers and/or tongue ? 
  would she be into you using a toy to supplement what you do ? 
  have you tried different position to see what she likes best ? 
  you ca n't displace all of the fat with your hand . 
  i promise you 'll be suprised . 
  anyway , even if you 're only 4 '' you can get a girl off with patience , practice and communication . 
  however , if you 're overweight it 's going to be a big hindrance since you ca n't get as close to her . 
  source : ex-fatty, 
  what is it about the conversation that upsets her ? 
  that 's what you need to work out . 
  is she worried about how you 'll raise your kids ? 
  does she feel like you do n't respect her views ? 
  that 'll let you know your next step . 
  because australian tv , movies and music ** suck ** . 
  american pop-culture is designed for a mass audience and appeals to many different people . 
  i made a bunch of money by helping out a nigerian prince . 
  trying to get someone to love you means trying to be the person you think they want . 
  there 's no better way to ruin a good relationship . 
  your aim should always be to find someone who loves you for yourself . 
  based on your edit , it seems like you have pretty fundamentally different views of the world and she has little desire to change her view . 
  i 'm sure you 're a wonderful couple in other ways but i do n't know that this is going to change . 
  lobster is very good , when it 's prepared well . 
  like a lot of other seafood it 's terrible when done badly . 
  wait , so you do n't care if you friends/family get attacked ? 
  that 's kinda harsh . 
  i get scared about road rage . 
  i worry when i 'm driving at night that if i drive faster than someone they 're going to take it as a challenge and somehow get out of their car and beat me up . 
  it 's illogical on many levels . 
  this subreddit is n't designed for legal help . 
  original to whom ? 
  never been on reddit in the 5 + years ? 
  good luck . 
  there 's a psychological phenomenon called the `` licensing effect '' . 
  in short , if you get a group of 20 people . 
  get 10 of them to do a small morally positive act and 10 to do something that does n't pertain to moral . 
  now , give them a chance to lie/cheat/steal . 
  crazily enough , the 10 that ** just acted morally ** are far more likely to lie/cheat/steal than those who did n't .
