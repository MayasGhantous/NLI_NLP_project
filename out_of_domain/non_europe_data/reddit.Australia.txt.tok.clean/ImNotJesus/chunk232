  can you live the rest of your life with him if he has his current beliefs ?

  australia could n't care less about horse racing the rest of the year . 
  it 's kind of bizarre .

  a few tips from an ex-fatty ( lost 100lbs ), 
  1 ) start small - go for a walk every day . 
  if you push yourself too hard you wo n't keep it going . 
  2 ) change your perspective - each good meal you eat is n't a sacrifice , it 's one meal closer to where you want to be . 
  each good meal is a small win and you should be happy about it . 
  3 ) expect setbacks but remind yourself why you 're doing it . 
  4 ) set up a token economy - each meal you eat well you get a point . 
  after x amount of points , you get a reward . 
  make it a reward worth having . 
  5 ) keep it simple . 
  lower your calories , exercise more and monitor results . 
  after a while , you 'll get a feel for what affects your body in what way . 
  6 ) your body is n't used to exercise . 
  start slow , warm up properly and ** stretch ** . 
  there are so few genuinely romantic songs . 
  seeing a girl and thinking she 's hot is n't fucking romantic .

  make sure to use lead-based paint .
