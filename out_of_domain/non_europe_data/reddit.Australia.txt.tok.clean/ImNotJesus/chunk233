  how have you been masturbating ? 
  it 's possible that if you were doing it very roughly you 've lost sensation . 
  if so , make sure you start being nicer to your cock . 
  is that what you said last night ? 
  psychology ** is ** a science . 
  how ancient ? 
  i 'd love to talk to freud about where psychology has gone . 
  i think he 'd find it fascinating and have some brilliant insights . 
  huh ? 
  you 're just simply wrong . 
  quick summary of the major schools of psychology and how they work . 
  i 'd teach him about different types of therapy too . 
  he was a hack ? 
  are you an idiot ? 
  he basically created the field . 
  that 's like saying newton was a hack because he did n't understand special relativity . 
  his contributions were still immensely important and a lot of it still stands up , if not just the underlying theories . 
  i think you 're mistaken . 
  i study psychology and it 's most definitely a science . 
  it 's practised as one and taught as one and is subject to the scientific method . 
  anyone who thinks it is n't is just simply mis-informed . 
  you know what they called alternative ( folk ) medicine that has been proven to work ? 
  medicine - tim minchin . 
  his ** theories ** still stand up . 
  a lot of his concepts were correct , he just did n't have sufficient evidence for it at the time . 
  i study psychology and 100 % agree that psychology needs to be a scientific study but saying that he was a hack is absurd considering how much his contributions still shape psychology today . 
  again , that 's just wrong . 
  any psychological study being taken into a journal subscribes to the scientific method . 
  as for the behaviour part , your friend simply does n't understand psychology if that 's their concern . 
  also , i repeat , i study psychology and can confirm for you that it is indeed regarded as a science at all respected universities . 
  man , you 're talking about stuff you do n't understand . 
  if you 'd just listen to me , i could actually teach you something here . 
  i 'm not trying to be a condescending asshole but i simply know more about this than you . 
  psychoanalysis is n't a dead subfield , it 's still practised by some and has started using the scientific method . 
  in fact , psychodynamic psychotherapy is still one of the most common types of therapy and is as effective as cbt , mbsr and act in treating a lot of mental health issues . 
  lastly , there 's a big difference between what freud predicted and the `` theories of christianity '' . 
  he proposed several ideas about how the mind worked . 
  a lot of those theories have actually proven to be correct . 
  what has generally been changed/adapted/improved is the ** mechanisms ** . 
  again , the newton example works better here . 
  he was n't completely wrong , his work just needed to be udpated . 
  okay , pal . 
  i 'm going to stop replying because you clearly know more than i do and this is pointless . 
  just in case anyone was wondering , this is called a [ mondegreen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondegreen ) . 
  my personal favourite : `` hold me closer , tony danza '', 
  my sister convinced me that the hottest day ever was 100 degrees celcius and only one person in the world survived because he lived in an iceblock . 
  anyone who does n't say this is an idiot , has n't ever had sex before or has a really , really sad life . 
  to be precise , it 's technically not a phobia but a somatoform disorder . 
  sorry , i 'm not trying to be pedant but increasing mental health knowledge is a passion of mine . 
  [ the more you know ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-21_jyyvyzxo/t16-fj9x6oi/aaaaaaaadqi/hajakxyuxfg/s1600/themoreyouknow.jpg ), 
  i wade through / r/askreddit getting removing the troll/rule breaking posts . 
  [ this ] ( http://themetapicture.com/media/funny-fire-bucket-of-water.jpg ) is how i feel . 
  if any gym had their members all come at the same time they 'd be fucked . 
  they live off memberships of people who do n't go anymore , you 're not alone . 
  ron ? 
  thanks , pal . 
  the dozens of posts i remove every day never get seen by reddit because it 's all in the new queue . 
  when we sometimes remove posts from the frontpage because no-one noticed it earlier , all hell breaks loose and we 're the worst mods in the world . 
  it 's a fairly thankless job haha . 
  edit : sorry , that sounds like a lot of complaining . 
  it 's an okay job and i 'm glad i do it , just get frustrated sometimes . 
  i did a trial at an mma gym because i was thinking about training there . 
  they told me that you have to sign a one-year contract to train there ( amateur place ) and if you want to break the contract early it 's a $ 100 fee . 
  do n't worry , if you pay for the year upfront you get 10 % off but then you ca n't cancel early . 
  avoid studying . 
  i love studying psychology . 
  i 'll take breaks from studying psychology by listening to unrelated psychology lectures . 
  for some reason the `` fuck you , you ca n't tell me what to do '' part of my brain is okay with studying , just as long as it 's not productive . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , that 's negligent parenting and they deserve to have their kids taken away . 
  i have sympathy for overweight people because i know how hard it is to change . 
  i have hatred for parents of overweight kids because they 're condemning their kid to a life of fighting it . 
  trust me , it 's been a long slow process of getting to be able to do anything . 
  one thing i did was accept that i 'm shit at focussing and just let myself have heaps of breaks instead of fighting with myself constantly . 
  small goals , rewards at each one . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  sure , as long as you do n't ask people what it is . 
  you 're welcome to ask people about their head injury experiences , just not what is essentially an unqualified medical opinion . 
  exactly . 
  we have way , way more food produced than what is actually needed . 
  it 's quite simple : anyone who knows enough about medicine to be of help , is smart enough to know what a stupid idea diagnosing someone over the internet is . 
  therefore , the only people commenting have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  this is a mod rule ( subreddit only ) , not an admin rule . 
  you would n't have any legal recourse to sue reddit as far as i know because they 're not making claims to be a medical source . 
  i used to do that out of superstition until i realised how dumb it was . 
  for the next few days i made an effort to step on every crack . 
  the most recent research shows that there seems to be a fair bit of variation in how people deal with trauma . 
  if you 're interested , martin seligman has down a lot of work on it . 
  well , it depends on the type . 
  some are open wards and some are closed . 
  however , she 'll be assessed straight away to see if she 's a risk of harm to herself or others . 
  if she is , they may restrain and/or sedate her but this is unlikely unless she 's being very aggressive . 
  alternative medicine . 
  i 'm not okay with it . 
  i do n't think it 's ever okay for people to be mislead when it comes to their health . 
  at best the practitioner is negligent , at worst fraudulent . 
  i passionately believe that there 's no reason they should be allowed to practise and i 'll implore anyone i discuss the topic with never to see one . 
  how 's she coping right now ? 
  it may be more appropriate to get her to see a psychologist instead of checking her into a hospital .
