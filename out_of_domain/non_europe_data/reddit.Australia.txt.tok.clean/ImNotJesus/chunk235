   so in everything , do to others what you would have them do to you , for this sums up the law and the prophets . 
  meth explains so many questions i had about the muppets, 
  that 's my point . 
  i do n't get why homosexuality is arbitrarily picked out and focussed on . 
  let 's hope that she does n't find circlejerk, 
  that 's ** a lot ** of ground to cover . 
  i 'll give you the absolute basics and you can always ask for more info . 
  also , remember that the concepts are fairly outdated . 
  id : id is the part of your brain that wants every sort of pleasure all the time . 
  it 's your drive to take what you want . 
  ego : this is the organised part of your brain that balances the ego and the superego, 
  superego : this is the moralising part of the brain . 
  it tells you what you ** should ** want but ignores the id . 
  freud 's stages of psychosocial development were essentially stages where , if not completed properly , the person has a weakness that they 'll spend their life trying to fix . 
  these stages are about unconscious battles between drives and `` growing up '' . 
  i have a feeling that this reference is a bit too old for most on reddit to remember/get, 
  it 's aliiiive, 
  put down the pitchforks guys , he 's a canadian soldier . 
  this does n't need to be turned into a referendum on the war or people calling them war criminals . 
  every picture of a soldier doing something good turns into a big fight . 
  just trying to pre-empt it . 
  this is completely true . 
  the evidence suggests that regular exercise does heaps of good for your brain . 
  bonus points if you start meditating too !, 
  a red one , a green one , a blue one . 
  it 's just a fantasy . 
  it probably keeps happening because it 's so distressing for you . 
  do n't sweat it , it means very little except that you find him attractive . 
  i indent but that 's the convention for psych essays . 
  to explain this further , there are parts of psychology research that do n't attempt to be scientific in the strictest sense . 
  qualitative research can be used in certain situations where quantitative research would be impossible and can also provide a foundation for future research . 
  for example , a qualitative paper could interview 5 elderly people about their experience of being old . 
  out of that , a common theme emerges where they discuss spending a lot of time thinking about their friends dying . 
  out of this , you could do quantitative research into the subjective happiness of the elderly and how it correlates with death within their social group . 
  in the strictest sense , the qualitative research is far less scientific but it can provide good insight ** as long as it is understood in context ** . 
  no psychology paper will ever be perfect because you 'll ** never ** have an experimental design with perfect internal ( the results reflect the true values ) and external ( the results can be generalised to the greater population ) validity because you ca n't ever control every variable . 
  however , the vast majority of psychological research makes every effort to be `` as scientific '' as possible . 
  it 's important not to confuse incomplete information with a lack of scientific rigour . 
  edit : i have n't had a chance to read the entire article word for word but it 's fairly fallacious from what i can see . 
  to call psychology `` not a science , it is very largely a belief system similar to religion . '', 
  is ridiculous and appears to be based on a very poor understanding of the aims of clinical psychology . 
  he argues that better definitions of mental illness are tantamount to a catch-all net that defines every as ill and that 's just plain wrong . 
  the reason that the dsm has grown in the number of illnesses over the years is that mental illness is incredibly difficult to define and diagnose . 
  no two mood disorders are the same . 
  the point he 's missing that is the bare necessity for mental illness is maladaptive behaviours and distress . 
  alternatively , it could suggest a publishing bias where non-results are n't being published . 
  this does happen and it 's a very important issue in a lot of different sciences . 
  perhaps it 's just more prevalent in psychology . 
  that 's like saying that you ca n't take any physics experiment that looks at position or momentum seriously because of heisenberg . 
  no study is perfect and there are obviously limitations in any study of subjective experience . 
  tinnitus is a subjective experience of a disorder that has no physical manifestation ( that we can see right now ) . 
  does that make it less real to study because any description of it will be influenced by subjective experience ? 
  no , it just means that more care is needed to make sure that any study of it is internally consistent . 
  sometimes , if i really think it will become popular and i ca n't think of something good , i 'll wait for someone else to respond in the hope of thinking of a funny comment . 
  it 's just as easy to get karma by bashing / r/atheism outside of / r/atheism as it is to get karma by bashing religion inside / r/atheism . 
  i 'm holding out for a reddit snowglobe, 
  because subjective experience relates to objective reality and can lead to valid conclusions . 
  let 's use an example :, 
  i want to study introversion . 
  now , by nature , that trait has to be objectively defined but based on mainly subjective experience , right ? 
  so , we measure introversion . 
  now let 's say we want to see if introverts are more likely to suffer from depression . 
  we use an objective definition that measures a mainly subjective experience and compare that to another objective measure mainly defined by subjective experience and we can make conclusions . 
  now let 's say that we find that introverts are significantly more likely to suffer from depression . 
  we 've taken subjective experience and studied it objectively . 
  it 's implied when we say depression or introversion that it 's never a perfect measure but that does n't mean that there is n't value in the correlation we just found , ** as long as the objective definitions remain consistent ** . 
  if we do that , we can fulfil the necessary elements of the scientific method ; relicability and falsifiability . 
  the article is horrific and misunderstands several basics of psychology . 
  see some of the answers [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/tckr0/do_you_as_scientists_consider_psychology_a_valid/ ) which ze milkman deleted after he did n't get the answers he wanted . 
  kind of ironic considering he was asking whether or not psychology is scientific . 
  silence . 
  it 's a weird experience when you notice that there 's no easily perceivable sound around you and you try yo really experience it . 
  in fact , if your brain does n't receive enough stimulation ( auditory * and * visual ) it will start to create them ( that 's how sensory deprivation tanks work ) . 
  denying your brain the stimulation it craves is a cool experience . 
  your replies : logic , logic , logic , logic , huge leap to desired outcome . 
  i never said that correlation proves causation , i said that subjective experience can give valuable scientific data . 
  stop trying to take everything i say to an extreme so that you can argue against it . 
  i do find it funny that you said that you were going to post on here to prove a point and then when you did n't get the answer you wanted you deleted the post . 
  fairly ironic considering the subject matter . 
  anyway , i 've spent far too long trying to educate someone who is clearly attached to their view and that 's a waste of time . 
  i love educating but i hate banging my head against a wall . 
  i 'm not interested in arguing with you . 
  it 's possible that people know more about a topic than you and you can learn something . 
  it 's not at all wtf worthy but it is cool, 
  i apologise, 
  he 's the older brother of my best friend from high school . 
  i spent so much time at their place growing up and since leaving high school i 've become much closer to him . 
  a girl on my bus told people i flashed her . 
  i did not flash her .

  repost from a few days ago . 
  sorry , pal . 
  pop-up twin towers ? 
  i wonder if you can drag the plane across the page . 
  none of the answers are really that accurate . 
  the difference between normal variation and a mental disorder is 3 factors . 
  for something to be a disorder it has to be ** pervasive ** , ** maladaptive ** and ** distressing ** ( the exact wording varies but that 's the gist ) . 
  for example , everyone has some days where they feel like crap . 
  if it 's pervasive ( in that it 's happening regularly ) , maladaptive ( causing changes in behaviour and distressing ( causes upset ) it goes from being a `` bad few days '' to a depression .
