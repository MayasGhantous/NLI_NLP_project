  the same can be said for add . 
  unfortunately , it 's a particularly hard one to define as all kids fall on a continuum of ability to focus and regulate themselves . 
  therefore , it is generally only considered a disorder ( some theorists actually do n't think it exists - i do n't agree ) when it 's pervasive ( regularly affecting behaviour ) , maladaptive ( causing behavioural problems ) and distressing . 
  these are very hard to measure in a child and obviously subjective . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historicity_of_jesus ) to the rescue . 
  tl ; dr historians do n't agree . 
  i 'd call that a first world victory, 
  there are some good answers in this thread . 
  i just want to add a few things :, 
  1 ) there are different types of depression . 
  dysthymic depression is longer lasting than what you probably think of as depression but it 's at a lower intensity . 
  it 's kind of like feeling consistently down for a really long time and as though things are hopeless . 
  2 ) try to remember that you 're motivated to see your friend in a certain way . 
  you remember him in a certain way and do n't want to think of him as `` sick '' . 
  it 's totally natural to miss some of the subtle signs, 
  to add to this ; a modern psychological understanding of obesity suggests that it 's really not as simple as making a choice to be skinnier . 
  fat people are n't lazy . 
  anyone who has lived and experienced what it 's like to try and change a lifetime of habits knows that . 
  * let me put it in a way that might make it easier to understand * . 
  let 's say that you 're an alcoholic . 
  your life spun out of control and you got to a point that you wanted to stop . 
  you quit . 
  stop drinking . 
  it 's hard but you 're committed and you really want to . 
  imagine now that 3 times a day you have to drink ** a little ** bit of alcohol . 
  just a few sips . 
  not just that , but you have to drink alcohol you do n't like as much because you know that your favourite is worse for you . 
  every day , throughout your recovery , you have to ** make a choice ** to only have a few sips of that alcohol you do n't particularly like . 
  does n't sound like such an easy choice now does it ? 
  i 'm a food addict . 
  i 'm emotionally affected by the food i eat . 
  i have a ** drive ** to eat the foods that are bad for me . 
  i lost 100lbs fighting myself ** every single fucking meal ** . 
  do you have any idea how emotionally tiring that gets ? 
  learn to meditate . 
  it 's incredibly good for your body and brain ( heaps of scientific evidence ) and takes no equipment or preparation . 
  click [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) and with 5 minutes a day you can create physical changes in your brain so large than an mri will show it . 
  nope and not even for the reason of guilt . 
  i get people that do n't want monogamy or think it 's unnecessary . 
  to me , it 's about making a commitment that you only want to share that one part of yourself with the person you love . 
  i think that it adds something really special to a relationship when you both honestly and deeply make that commitment . 
  i would n't just not cheat for her , i would n't cheat because i 'd be cheating myself out of a connection to my partner . 
   if i 'm in a shitty relationship , or a relationship which was n't going anywhere ; i 'd cheat . 
  i hate that attitude . 
  if you 're so unhappy that you 'd hurt someone that badly , just fucking leave the relationship . 
  cheating is a selfish and spiteful thing to do . 
  god it felt good to say . 
  let me put it to you this way . 
  no-one * wants * to be obese . 
  no-one chooses to significantly cut shorter their life , feel unattractive , get sick more often , get ridiculed by the public , feel uncomfortable all the time , get puffed out from walking up the stairs etc. 
  you do n't get to that point because you want it or it 's the lifestyle you choose for yourself . 
  let me ask you this . 
  if you asked every obese person in the world whether they 'd want their kids to be obese , what percentage do you think would say yes ? 
  i think less than 1 %, 
  how you can be morally opposed to enjoying something ? 
  that 's an absurd statement as you have no control over what you do/don ' t like . 
  thinking it 's immoral to touch yourself is n't much less absurd but you 're welcome to your own opinions . 
  no yes/no answer questions . 
  daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  take your dog to the vet, 
  how is it bad for wellbeing ? 
  i believe the government has the duty to protect its citizens . 
  everyone may agree on a different level of involvement but no-one disagrees that kids who are being abused should be taken away . 
  either way , the government needs to make laws that protect its citizens and promote growth . 
  your response pretty much in no way responds to what i said . 
  i 'm not saying that society should have a `` being obese is okay '' attitude because it 's not . 
  i just think that we would get much better results if we accept that no-one wants to be in that position and instead of focussing on trying to convince fat people to change , we focus on making it easier * to * change or avoid the situation in the first place . 
  what if you make the basic assumption that self-destruction is n't rational , or people do n't have the means to avoid self-destruction ? 
  my theory : everyone wants to be happy , most just do n't know how . 
  by the way , your theory has been very well-researched . 
  it 's called in-group bias . 
  edit : the most important early work was done by tajfel . 
  famous and really important social psych research . 
  where 's the question ? 
  is n't the welfare of their citizens the number 1 priority ? 
  secular morality ? 
  actually that 's what i * am * studying . 
  cool . 
  watching the clippers overtime game two days ago . 
  my internet cut out with 3 minutes to go and came back on * just * in time to show me the final score . 
  melbourne , australia , where we do n't use archaic measurements . 
  by realising that i ca n't change people . 
  everyone is limited in one way or another . 
  the whole point of family is that you love them anyway . 
  that 's execution though , i 'm not talking about that . 
  you need to go speak to a professional therapist . 
  wanting to die is a sign of mental illness and just like any illness , you should see a professional . 
  please find a local psychologist . 
  this is completely true and has been studied extensively by paul ekman ( the inspiration for the show lie to me ) . 
  there 's some really fascinating research on the topic . 
  yeh , it 's a really interesting topic ( that 's still very new in psychology ) . 
  there 's been a shift in recent years ( from some theorists ) from a model of sick vs not sick to a continuum of life happiness and satisfaction . 
  it seems like there are certain universal truths : exercise is important , meditation improves well-being , social relationships are important , charity and helping others hugely increases happiness . 
  despite that , there are certain parts of happiness that ca n't be distilled down the `` rules '' . 
  i want to spend my life as a therapist . 
  a lot of people could n't imagine a more painful career . 
  i think that the more recent literature suggests that happiness ( particularly when it comes to career ) is more about matching your environment to your individual wants/needs than x is objectively more enjoyable than y.
