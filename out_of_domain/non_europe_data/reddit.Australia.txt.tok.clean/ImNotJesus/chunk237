  i think it 's a good but not perfect rule . 
  for example , i like being teased by my friends . 
  if you want to get close to me , you do it by making fun of me . 
  if i treated everyone else like that , i 'd alienate a lot of people . 
  why not treat people as they wish to be treated ? 
  very true . 
  there 's a very well accepted theory in modern psychology called attachment theory . 
  it basically suggests that the type of care you receive from your parents leaves you with an attachment * style * . 
  these are ; secure , anxious and avoidant ( you can see evidence of all of these in young children ) . 
  securely attached people take on challenges by being problem-focussed ( how can we fix this issue ) . 
  they 're generally happier and have longer lasting relationships . 
  anxiously attached people tend to react very emotionally . 
  they ** demand ** attention because they fear that they wo n't receive the care-giving they desire otherwise and as a result have poor self-regulation . 
  avoidant people simply avoid emotional distress . 
  they 'll deny that they 're upset and this costs them the ability to emotionally connect to other people in the same way as securely attached people can . 
  it also stops the development of constructive coping mechanisms . 
  ** tl ; dr ** ; creating a secure , loving environment for children will give them a far happier life overall .

  i like that quote . 
  thanks, 
  i think that it 's okay to have the basic assumption that people want to be treated kindly and fairly until you find proof to the counter .

  charming, 
  ever heard of scientology ? 
  it does n't take that long . 
  [ supply and demand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supply_and_demand ), 
  i never said he is n't , all i 'm doing is enforcing the rules of the subreddit . 
  if you think that you may sink into a depression , go speak to a psychologist . 
  this is a disease and needs to be treated as such , seek help . 
  short term things :, 
  1 ) regular exercise, 
  2 ) start meditating, 
  3 ) regular sleep/eating habits, 
  i do n't . 
  i do n't want them knowing where i get my jokes from . 
  what a mooving story . 
  i 'm so , so sorry, 
  protip : the little asterisk shows that you editted your post . 
  maybe i 'm wrong but i thought he said something different originally . 
  i apologise if i am . 
  my method is purely posting so much volume that only a masochist would try sift through it . 
  if you get further than a week i 'll be thoroughly impressed . 
  you 're missing my point . 
  i 'm saying that the key element is finding out how people want to be treated and not assuming that everyone wants the same thing as you . 
  some people want lots of help when they 're going through a hard time , others need to be left alone . 
  the being teased is just an example . 
  the only one that has ever really affected me was hitchens . 
  no arguments , just making the underlying motive more explicit and emphasising empathy . 
  because marriage has legal consequences . 
  also , no . 
  it 's not a religious institution at all . 
  no sir, 
  there are a bunch of studies to show not only that but also that we 're terrible at predicting will bring us happiness . 
  watch dan gilbert 's ted videos on the topic if you 're interested . 
  kick rick santorum in the nuts as hard as i can, 
  vagina, 
  that reddit , overall , is very much pro science but you 'll still get downvoted to hell if you present a scientific argument about a topic many redditors feel strongly about . 
  i still write long posts about how an immense amount of psychological evidence suggests that corporal punishment is a really , really bad way to parent , i just accept that it will get buried and probably be a waste of effort . 
  stds . 
  i almost have bingo . 
  thanks herby, 
  did n't the bright green + giant number tip you off ? 
  i think you 're missing the point but i appreciate the sentiment . 
  bad jokes, 
  i 'll let you off with a warning then . 
  your number would be much higher if i did n't do 90 % of my redditting from work where i do n't have res . 
  i meant the res number . 
  i still upvote you plenty since you 're ( generally ) very reasonable . 
  you 're there to learn . 
  you 'll have other great chances to party . 
  you 'll never get the chance to learn as much . 
  turn up to class , use ** active ** note-taking and take it seriously . 
  i did n't say ignore everyone else . 
  i just mean that learning should be priority # 1 . 
  the realisation of this was the impetus to make a life where i leave behind a legacy . 
  the lives i touch , the changes i make to the world , make me immortal in a way far more meaningful than any afterlife . 
  when i went to the most easterly point in australia and looked out from the lighthouse there . 
  i saw a pod of dolphins surfing the waves for about 15 minutes . 
  the best part was watching the baby trying to get the hang of it . 
  he sucked though . 
  yoga nidra meditation . 
  search for it on itunes , ucla have some . 
  try it , you wo n't regret it . 
  number of words typed that were n't directly related to work/study . 
  it would be horrific . 
  that obviously depends on the field . 
  very few psychology text books will be published without the name beck in it but i do n't think he 'll ever be a household name . 
  are you more anxious or avoidant ? 
  as an fyi , melatonin is a prescription drug in australia and i know someone who has had it prescribed by a sleep doctor . 
  that 's the hope . 
  you may read one of my psychology books one day , 
  not saying it 's as strong , it clearly is n't . 
  just saying that it is effective in changing sleep habits ( if taken properly ) . 
  nope , reddit is very much pro-corporal punishment from my experience .
