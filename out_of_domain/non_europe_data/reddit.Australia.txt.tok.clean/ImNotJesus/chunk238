  no matter how many meta-analyses i link to , i still get `` i was hit as a child and i turned out okay `` s by the dozen . 
  well , yes , until about the age of 7 ( it 's been a couple of years since i studied development so i may be wrong about the number ) . 
  it 's certainly not beyond those above that age . 
  that 's common for avoidant people . 
  because you do n't learn to regulate your own emotion or deal with it constructively , you have no method of coping when the distress is too high to avoid . 
  i bet you 're like me and you have people complaining that you never tell them how you feel until it 's already a huge issue for you . 
  therapy has helped me deal with it ( to some extent ) , meditation too . 
  it 's a whole field , you 'll need to be more specific about what you want . 
  i 'd recommend you start with paul ekman 's wiki page though , or just google his name . 
  that 's going to be tough to beat . 
  there 's a disorder called something like `` delayed sleep cycle '' . 
  i know someone who was prescribed melatonin for it ( it 's a prescription drug here ) . 
  beyond that , avoid computer light ( and use f.lux if necessary ) at night and try to get regular exercise . 
  i recently rinsed my cereal bowl in the bathroom sink for no conceivable reason . 
  not that crazy but made me laugh and laugh :, 
  had a customer come up to me and tell me the trolleys were really dirty . 
  mid-way through his sentence he dropped his chocolate wrapper in a trolley without realising it . 
  good call . 
  underrated band and wonderful song . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3jjlkfx5gk ) with lyrics, 
  i read almost exclusively non-fiction about psychology and related topics . 
  probably not that helpful , sorry . 
  i see your problem , being wrong . 
  there 's very little science . 
  [ citation required ] . 
  actually , a lot of the seminal research came from israeli researchers ( it 's been repeated tonnes of times since in other countries ), 
  actually the evidence says that you 're wrong . 
  there has been a lot of research into it . 
  i never said that those with insecure attachments are doomed . 
  i have one myself . 
  well , it * is * an expert on immigration . 
  do you mean ideal for the parents or more conducive to happiness ? 
  interesting, 
  two and a half men is n't a great show and it obviously caters to a certain lowest common denominator . 
  that being said , if you can past your own snobbery , there are some good laughs .

  help !, 
  i 've been to synagogue once in the last 5 years , because my girlfriend wanted to see what it was like . 
  it was yom kippur ( the holiest day of the year ) where a special prayer is said for those that had passed . 
  after the prayer , the rabbi decided to tell everyone that he 'd noticed there was a lot more deaths the day after yom kippur ( supposedly the day of judgement ) and he assumed that meant that god was killing people who were n't being observant enough . 
  he spent the next 5 minutes telling everyone that they ** have ** to come regularly ( not just on the big holidays ) to avoid the same fate . 
  i 've never been so angry . 
  tl ; dr fucking asshole manipulative rabbi, 
  the worst version of this is watching a movie late at night when still living at home . 
  super quiet talking followed by insanely loud gun shots . 
  they 'd love my first dates . 
  i like it because it 's subtle . 
  not in those quantities . 
  i do n't think i want to know, 
  shit , i thought it was swimming . 
  i assumed that 's why people wear those noseplugs . 
  my favourite knock knock joke ( works better in person ) . 
  knock knock, 
  who 's there ? 
  interrupting cow, 
  interru ... 
  ** moooooooooo **, 
  i think it 's just designed to create a barrier to mis-use . 
  no-one saying it 's foolproof . 
  considering that they 're the only two songs about a woman i have to assume you 're right . 
  there are tonnes of open courses available online from top universities that will give you a feel for getting an undergraduate degree in psychology . 
  check out [ this ] ( http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses ), 
  it only makes it worse next time . 
  each milestone feels great for that moment but it 's like a drug . 
  you need a stronger and stronger fix to get you off . 
  being accepting does n't mean tolerating any and all behaviour . 
  you do n't have to enjoy watching two guys blow each other to believe that they should have the right to do it . 
  if you enjoyed watching it , it would n't be tolerance anyway . 
  that is a magnificent gif, 
  i had a really bad groin injury for a long time . 
  i got regular physiotherapy treatments on it . 
  the injury was real but i always claimed that the most painful part was right near the pelvis and that 's where i got most of the massage . 
  this is n't funny , this is negligently harsh and fucking dangerous . 
  there was no wit and nothing clever , he 's just endangering the health of a scared girl . 
  shameful . 
  yeh , i think he 'll really be turned on watching a baby 's head burst through and tear it too . 
  sexy . 
  there 's a good chance they are n't lying . 
  they 're probably just mistaken . 
  the snakes and spiders are scary , but nothing in australia is more dangerous than [ drop bears ] ( http://australianmuseum.net.au/drop-bear ), 
  they 're just statistically more common ? 
  someone being flattered that i responded to them because i 'm a `` reddit celebrity '' . 
  i do not think of myself as one to begin with but hard to know how to feel about that . 
  your lack of hymen was showing . 
  yeh , the compliment made it weird , not the paying an old guy to put metal through your cock . 
  why are you with her then ? 
  you sound like a great guy . 
  my favourite example of irony : creating a song about irony wherein nothing listed is ironic . 
  it 's the greatest masterpiece of all time . 
  i literally explode with anger when people use it wrong . 
  is it literally 99.99 % ? 
  i ** hate ** when sports commentators say `` the clippers are within 3 points '' when they 're exactly 3 points behind . 
  they 're not within 3 . 
  they are three points behind . 
  if it was ** within ** 3 it would be either 1 or 2 . 
  note : this annoys me in all contexts , not just when the clippers are losing by 3 points . 
  i get really annoyed when people use real mental disorders as a way of describing themselves . 
  `` like , omg , i 'm so ocd about using public toilets '' . 
  no , you 're just not . 
  when you feel a little bit sick you do n't say * `` oh god , i feel like such cancer right now . '',
