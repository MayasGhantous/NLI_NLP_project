  the best example of irony :, 
  writing an entire song about irony and listing nothing that is actually ironic , thereby creating the ultimate meta-irony . 
  we had a teacher who did similar . 
  he also told us really dirty jokes and stories about fucking drunk chicks . 
  2 years after i finished i heard he was fired for showing kids porn . 
  i 'd say that 's more sarcasm than irony . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  i 'm probably biassed and trying to maintain to love of the idea .

  get out !, 
  i do n't even go for the clippers , they were just the first team to come to mind, 
  dem wings, 
  the first time waking up next to a girl was a much bigger moment than the first time sleeping with her . 
  after waiting way too long to get myself in the game , i have such a vivid memory of that morning and how wonderful it felt to be lying there . 
  wrong religion , buddy . 
  actually , there 's no evidence that vitamin c works . 
  sorry , pal . 
  not closer but i do certainly follow it . 
  i do so for two very important reasons :, 
  1 ) the behavious and beliefs of american politicians permeate throughout the world . 
  obama 's recent support of gay marriage has put pressure on australian politicians to do the same ( they still have n't ) . 
  2 ) it 's fucking hilarious . 
  seriously , santorum ?

  7 months . 
  i think it 'll be okay . 
  it 's not about being afraid to be abandoned , it 's about signalling to the other person that you 're committed to their forever . 
  it 's about saying `` i 'm so sure that i want to spend the rest of my life with you that i want to shout it from the rooftops '', 
  there are all sorts of tax/legal implications but the most important thing for me is that my partners knows how committed i am to her . 
  [ citation required ], 
  i do n't know where you got that idea from but saying that it 's factual does n't make it so . 
  can i see some evidence for your ostensibly scientific claim ? 
  hedonism . 
  `` why does n't everyone just do thinks that make them happy all the time '', 
  celebrity jeopardy holds the top like 5 spots . 
  you do n't get karma for self-posts so if they 're doing it for that reason , they 're wasting a lot of energy . 
  really , i find comment so much easier to get than link, 
  i think that you have a decision to make . 
  it 's possible that if she calms down and you talk through it rationally she 'll change her mind but i would n't count on that . 
  everyone has their deal-breakers and this could be one for her . 
  everyone has irrational fears/concerns . 
  i 'm sure that you 're very irrational about a bunch of things in a relationship that would be dealbreakers for lots of women . 
  i 'm not saying he should stay but calling it `` crazy '' and `` immature '' is , i think , unfair . 
  from memory , the admins did a blog a while ago saying it was 1 % . 
  that 's right , we are the 1 % . 
  and you ** will ** get caught , one way or another . 
  did you just randomly link to articles you do n't understand ? 
  the oxytocin one does n't relate at all . 
  you have a wiki link and a non-scientific article that mentions research and does n't actually link to any ( big red flag ) and finally a link from the `` christian research institute '' . 
  bravo , what a useless set of links . 
  tip # 1 : if you want a meaningful real relationship , you 'll disregard those incredibly stupid beta and alpha archetypes . 
  here 's my very easy two step process to finding a girl :, 
  1 ) be the best you - that means being true to yourself but still challenging yourself to improve . 
  2 ) look for girls that ** want guys like you ** . 
  if you meet a girl who wants an `` alpha guy '' and decided to date you because you present as one , are n't things going to go horribly pear-shaped when she realises you are n't ? 
  join clubs , try online dating , whatever it takes to find girls that are into the type of guy ** you ** are . 
  edit : to be clear ; being `` alpha '' may be a great way to trick drunk girls into sleeping with you . 
  i 've never tried it myself ( sounds horribly unsatisfying ) but if that 's your aim , go for it . 
  if you actually want to have a long , happy relationship , you need to find someone that likes you for who you are . 
  that sounds like a cliche but some cliches stay around because there 's some truth in them . 
  i ca n't remember who but there are people who follow the wbc around and make their life difficult when they 're trying to picket funerals . 
  it may be worth trying to contact them . 
  edit : they 're called the [ patriot guard ] ( http://www.patriotguard.org/ ) ( credit to all of those messaging me ), 
  a more creative idea : send them correspondence informing them that for every minute they protest , the town will donate x amount of money to a pro-gay rights charity . 
  get a bunch of people to commit to not a lot of money and it 'll add up quickly . 
  tell them that the donation will be in their name too .

  i tell everyone that this is an [ original idea ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1058017/ ), 
  getting arrested proves nothing . 
  edit :, 
  i can confirm that op has linked me to an article about the picketing . 
  i 'm concerned that if he does it will break the no personal information rule . 
  cheating is cheating is cheating . 
  here 's the thing about cheating . 
  there are no hard and fast rules . 
  each couple has different levels that they think are cheating . 
  i would consider it cheating if my partner was with another girl , some guys would n't . 
  for some couples , `` just kissing '' is n't cheating . 
  it 's all just about what you feel comfortable with . 
  if you do n't feel comfortable with her kissing other girls , you have the right to say so . 
  irrespective of your views on weed , self-medicating is never the answer . 
  this kid needs help . 
  my instinct was that part of him wants to revoke the consent but feels like he should think it 's hot and be okay with it . 
  my so still teases me about our first date . 
  i went to meet her at a cafe and ordered a `` soy hot chocolate '' . 
  it 's the manliest of all drinks . 
  note : i got marshmallows so it was worth it .
