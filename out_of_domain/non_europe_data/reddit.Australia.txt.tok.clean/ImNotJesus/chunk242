  haha, 
  gladly !, 
  studies have shown that it :, 
  * increases willpower, 
  * increases overall happiness, 
  * reduces depressive symptoms, 
  * reduces anxiety symptoms, 
  to put it into context , there 's a relatively recent for of therapy called mindfulness based stress reduction that is just as effective as cbt in treating a bunch of mental health issues . 
  here 's the thing about meditating , being `` bad '' at it , is actually good for it having benefits . 
  you get the benefits from noticing your attention not being where you want it to be and then gently bringing it back to where you want ( e.g. , your breath ) . 
  studies have shown that only a few hours of meditation ( total ) can cause physical changes in the brain . 
  if you 've got add this would be ** great ** for you . 
  misinformed = / = dumb, 
  even 5 minutes will give you benefit . 
  [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) are some guided meditations provided by the ucla mindfulness centre . 
  if you do at one of those a day ( more if you 're enjoying it ) , i guarantee you 'll notice benefits . 
  the biggest tip is that you should n't be judgemental of yourself . 
  it 's a very unnatural thing and it takes time to feel `` comfortable '' doing it . 
  no-one 's life is perfect . 
  i 'm sure he has just as many struggles as everyone else . 
  if he 's getting drunk every day , does n't that tell you that all is n't well in his life ? 
  i would start with some guided ones and when you 've got some practise it 's easier to do it without . 
  because you 're not just suggesting specific items to them , you 're changing the way they see the world . 
  good man . 
  let me put it to you this way , you 're a random person on the other side of the world . 
  if this did n't actually work , why would i bother . 
  also , please get back to me and tell me how you go . 
  so you knew they were doing something, 
  awesome !, 
  i like different ones in different moods , that 's a great one to start with . 
  of course . 
  i still regularly tip , unless i get bad service . 
  if i 'm well taken care of , i tip up to about 10 % . 
  i 'm going to guess ... american ? 
  only an american would pick pearl harbour but not the first day of ww2 . 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
  start [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) !, 
  do one of those a day ( i 'd mix it up ) and it 'll change your life . 
  please let me know how you go . 
  i feel like it 's a good instinct to have that whenever my girlfriend says to me `` i had the worst dream '' , my instant reaction is `` i 'm really sorry for whatever i did '', 
  did she dump you for hating fun ? 
  because you do or do n't have one ? 
  also , how long had you been together when this happened ? 
  i have such violent hatred for psychics . 
  they do so much harm . 
  not only is that fucking crazy but why did it take so long for that to upset her ? 
  i ca n't imagine that that was the only reason . 
   ex-friend, 
  ftfy, 
  well , as his brother you can tell him that you honestly think it 's a mistake . 
  ** however ** , it 's his choice and if he wants to make it you should support him . 
  do n't think of it as `` they had 3 billion in the bank and now have 1 billion because it went to x company '' . 
  in business you have several companies or people or banks that owe you money and you also have assets that are worth money . 
  think of them as positives . 
  on the other side , you are likely to owe some people/business/banks money and they 're negatives . 
  to make it ** way ** to simplistic , think of it as the postives minus the negatives now equals 2 billion less than it did . 
  do n't they already lie about enough ? 
  why add something pointless . 
  i get downvoted incredibly hard whenever i say that i think corporal punishment is wrong . 
  this frustrates me because most people on reddit would consider themsleves pro-science but they seem to ignore the amount of scientific evidence that i offer . 
  i find the / r/atheism is a circlejerk circlejerk to be even more obnoxious . 
  i did n't think i was being that subtle . 
  we evolved a natural disgust for it because it was n't conducive to successfully passing on our genes . 
  religion may have had an impact but there 's a reason that incest is n't significantly more common in india . 
  i do n't think you understood what i said, 
  some co-workers collaborated to pretend to be from a competing company that wanted to poach me . 
  i missed a different job opportunity as a result of their prank . 
  the internet is pretty fucking mindblowing . 
  this is n't really something you can/should decide right now, 
  sorry , to be clear , i do n't think no form of life exists in the universe . 
  i think the odds are good that some does . 
  however , to imply that they 've visited the earth and the government knows about it is a very different claim . 
  i would n't tell them anything , i would ask them why they 're hurting so much . 
  follow this very simple plan . 
  step 1 : light a bunch of candles, 
  step 2 : put on some relaxing music, 
  step 3 : put a towel down on the bed, 
  step 4 : give her a long , professional ( no dodgy touching unless she initiates ) massage using some massage oil or moisturiser . 
  spend no less than 30 minutes . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  it 's really easy with oil/moisturiser, 
  i ca n't eat fruit besides apples . 
  i had an evil stepmother who used to try and force-feed me fruit that i did n't like . 
  i feel sick thinking about eating most fruit now . 
  relevant username ? 
  there are no rules . 
  different people need different amounts of time . 
  also , she would n't be the first person to start dating again before being ready . 
  either way , the most important thing is that you do n't take this to mean something about yourself . 
  take your time and do n't start until you feel ready . 
  sounds like you have a crush , buddy . 
  [ here ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doilanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.539 ) is a link to the biggest meta-analysis on the topic . 
  they measured 11 outcomes of corporal punishment , some positive some negative . 
  the only positive they consistently found was immediate compliance . 
  conversely , corporal punishment was related to poorer behaviour overall , more aggression , a poorer parent-child relationship and a bunch of others . 
  so , basically , parents who spank their children see immediate compliance ( because the child is scared ) and assume that the strategy is working , when it 's actually just causing worse behaviour and more `` need '' to spank . 
  most things stimulate the prefrontal cortex in one way or another . 
  what 's special about this ? 
  i give blood regularly .
