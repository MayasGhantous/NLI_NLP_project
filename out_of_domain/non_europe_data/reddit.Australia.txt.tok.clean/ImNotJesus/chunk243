  i save several lives each time i do it and they 'll never know my name . 
  well , it starts with inviting a woman over for a date . 
  i slip something special into her wine and she passes out . 
  then , crucifixion . 
  move to ~ ~ australia ~ ~ any country that is n't insane, 
  a few days ago , for no conceivable reason , i started rinsing my cereal bowl in the bathroom sink . 
  you should n't ever have to worry that you 're going to offend anyone by having your own beliefs . 
  if ** your ** beliefs upset them , that 's not your fault . 
  however , you should still be respectful ( sounds like you are ) . 
  here are a couple of ideas to start with . 
  it 's more complex than this but it gives you a good overview . 
  ** diathesis-stress model ** :, 
  think of this like a cup of water . 
  everyone starts with a bit of water in their cup and situational experiences add more water . 
  let 's say each cup can take 100ml for an arbitrary example . 
  the idea is that you may have 50ml of stress happening to you but your genetic basis ( bit starting in the cup ) is only worth 30ml . 
  overall , your cup wo n't overflow because the total is n't over 100ml . 
  someone else with the same amount of stress may be more pre-disposed to stress and start with 60ml . 
  theirs `` overflows '' and they develop a mental disorder . 
  there needed to be the existence of a stressor but without the predisposition it would n't have happened . 
  ** gene-environment reciprocal model ** :, 
  this is the idea that people with certain genetic traits are likely to seek out environments/activities/peer groups that fit with those traits . 
  for example , an introvert is very anxious in social settings . 
  as a result , they avoid socialising with friends and the anxiety becomes worse . 
  over time , a small issue has snowballed into a larger issue because it was n't challenged . 
  you 're never responsible for feeling a certain way because you ca n't control that . 
  you 're responsible for how you deal with those feelings . 
  if you 're suffering from depression , your first step is to seek counselling . 
  check what resources your college have available to you . 
  wait , you pee in your cup so you do n't miss 2 minutes of movie ? 
  apparently , there 's only one place in the world where it 's impossible to get a cold .

  there are ways that something can hurt you besides immediate effects . 
  i 'm not saying that anyone should/shouldn ' t smoke but to say that it is n't dangerous just because no-one dies from the side effects is a tad silly .

  good , be persistent .

  psychology . 
  i 'm not a complete expert ( yet ) but i know a lot and am always excited to research more if there are things i do n't know . 
  i did n't say that it 's unsafe , i 'm saying that making an argument that it 's safe because you ca n't overdose on it for a mind-altering drug is pretty daft . 
  there are clearly other ways you can cause damage besides overdose . 
  again , i 'm not saying it 's bad , i 'm just saying your argument is . 
  yes . 
  i would n't believe a fucking thing dr oz says . 
  he 's a quack who pushes homeopathy on tv .

  my mum enjoys telling people about the time that i said `` when i grow up , i want to be a mummy '' . 
  you 're a dick . 
  be an adult and monitor your own consumption or go to the bathroom .

  i never said there were, 
  tell the school . 
  if they do n't respond , take it further . 
  several sporting participation awards . 
  your move waul .

  at my junior basketball club we had the `` coaches award '' . 
  it basically meant that you tried really hard but were n't good enough to be the mvp . 
  i won a lot of those . 
  it had only been up for a minute , give me a chance . 
  your questions were n't even close to fitting the criteria, 
  haha . 
  i have no problems with diablo questions , i 'm excited too but one was basically a dae and the other was a l4g lol, 
  generally not because the way serving staff get paid in my country ** is n't ** absurd . 
  if you think that peeing in cups is the only alternative i highly doubt you 're genuinely 31 . 
  david eagleman wrote a brilliant book on this . 
  it 's called sum and it 's basically just a series of short stories about alternative afterlives . 
  it 's awesome . 
  i get that, 
  there 's one afterlife where you stay in this area like a giant airport until you stop being mentioned on earth . 
  people stay for different lengths of time but no-one there knows what happens next . 
  one guy had been there for over 100 years because he 'd killed himself in a local lake . 
  shortly after his death , a college was built and each year as the tour group goes past that lake , they tell the story of his death . 
  i 'm doing it absolutely no justice but it 's all really interesting concepts like that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpz7bijggq0 ) is a sample . 
  it 's one thing to say you 're uncomfortable with gay marriage , it 's another to say something that 's essentially a scientific claim that has absolutely no scientific backing . 
  this is ignorance at its worst . 
  that was pretty unnecessary, 
  fighting your insecurities and doubters is a triumph in my eyes . 
  was the bullying you used to receive something you were aware of when you started modelling ?
