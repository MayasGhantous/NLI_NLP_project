  / r/circlejerk, 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  do you have a go-to mayo recipe ? 
  i 've noticed a huge variation in recipes online and my last one was a total failure . 
  relevant tongue, 
  vaccines do n't cause autism . 
  if you do n't vaccinate your children , you are n't just negligently risking their lives , you 're risking the lives of all those who are too immuno-compromised to get vaccinated and rely on herd immunity . 
  this is n't just a terribly constructed argument , it 's scientifically false . 
  children lack empathy because they do n't have have cognitive capacity to take another 's perspective ( shown in a myriad of interesting studies ) . 
  almost 50 % now, 
  i study moral psychology and his contributions are undeniably great . 
  i ca n't listen to him talk about atheism though . 
  he becomes so obnoxious .

  / r/offmychest, 
  must be an atheist, 
  have you been faking orgasms ? 
  if yes , then stop . 
  you 're giving him the wrong message . 
  you 're going to hurt his feelings but he 'd prefer to know , i know i would . 
  you need to tell him that . 
  tell him to wait . 
  you should n't feel pressured to do anything that hurts you . 
  watch his ted video , it 's pretty good, 
  i see no logical reason to invest emotional energy in this girl . 
  she has a boyfriend and is moving soon anyway . 
  find someone else . 
  why the fuck does he have to draw and colour in pictures ? 
  no that 's stupid . 
  who would people rent from ? 
  also , people 's `` second '' homes are in a different price range to those at the bottom end of the market that you 're trying to protect . 
  then you do n't have sex with that guy . 
  it is that simple . 
  i think it 's either less than 2 minutes or no comments have been made . 
  i may be making that up . 
  many of us reddit at work . 
  i , without thinking , opened earthporn at work and had a small heart attack . 
  you always vote for big black dicks . 
  conversely , it 's a great way to cover up my be ~ ~ a ~ ~ stiality habit . 
  oh , that 's just hd pictures of animals . 
  edit : please stop telling me that `` it 's spelled bestiality , because it 's the best '' . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever searched for it and i 'm sorry if i 've offended your passion . 
  are seatbelts not a legal requirement in america ? 
  in australia , the driver gets a ticket if any passenger is n't wearing it . 
  also , do n't be a fucking idiot . 
  wear a seatbelt . 
  andrew , how many subs are you a mod of ? 
  askreddit keeps me busy enough . 
  do you the incognito guy get 's ` nam style flashbacks from all the horrors he has seen ? 
  be ~ ~ a ~ ~ stiality generally consists of a human having sex with said animal . 
  please note : i do ** not ** actually have a beastiality habit . 
  i do n't want to end up like that guy i have tagged as `` midget porn '' who always has at least one person replying to him with that . 
  / r/cvwriting, 
  / r/nazidressups, 
  / r/jackingoffinthecubicles, 
  / r/eatingtunaatwork, 
  the last is the worst one . 
  ahh right . 
  i 'm pretty much always in askreddit/new anyway so i guess it 's a more natural role for me . 
  i 'd prefer dog lover but it could be far worse . 
  i 'm sure there are worse tags of me out there . 
  i still get messages about my penis . 
  there 's a reason only 1 friend knows this reddit name . 
  sorry pal , i tried to pick all ones that do n't actually exist . 
  that seems like a fair and well thought out response . 
  shit . 
  uhhh not jesus . 
  my work is fine with me redditting . 
  as long as i 'm at my desk , they do n't care . 
  fuck , how 'd you guess ? 
  i just tried , it wo n't accept the name . 
  / r/nazidressups works though !, 
  yes , clearly if they 're happy with me using non-work websites during work time they 're also okay with me masturbating in my cubicle to loud porn . 
  if they allow me to do one thing , surely i can do everything right ? 
  dae start singing the ending song to grease in their head ? 
  * okay *, 
  wow you really are a lightning rod for hate are n't you, 
  i 'm pretty sure / r/cakeporn takes the cake . 
  thank you , thank you . 
  i 'll be here all week . 
  try the chicken . 
  the point was that just because they 're okay with reddit , does n't mean that the word porn coming up in my internet history is okay . 
  you need the chrome plug-in modify headers ( it 's how i watch daily show/colbert from australia ) . 
  once it 's installed , on the first line put a tick in the box . 
  then type :, 
  x-forwarded-for | 12.13.14.15 | us ip, 
  in the respective boxes . 
  seems fair, 
  only the true messiah denies his divinity, 
  doing god 's work , son . 
  [ tall poppy syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tall_poppy_syndrome ), 
  the hip cramps . 
  oh god the hip cramps . 
  worst is probably when the girl is on top and getting a bit too vigorous with the motion , it slips out and instead of going back in hits her pelvis bone . 
  that 's a mood killer right there . 
  i like that tag because i get regular messages from people saying `` i upvoted , hope that made you happy '' it does make me happy . 
  not the upvote itself but someone going to that random effort to make me happy is a nice feeling .
