  i do n't care as much if some guy has more money than he knows what to do with if people are n't starving in the streets and people do n't have proper access to healthcare . 
  i want to see `` alternative medicine '' to not have separate rules for sale than real medicine . 
  if you want to sell something and say it has certain healing properties , you should have to go through the exact same rigors that anyone getting a drug approved has to . 
  why the fuck should we ever allow untrained people to hand out unproven medicines to sick people . 
  it 's unambiguously dangerous and stupid . 
  it 'll happen in time . 
  just do n't close the door to any experiences in the mean time . 
  sex with someone you like or are attracted to is still fun ( plus a bit of experience always helps ) . 
  just make sure you 're being honest/respectful . 
  sure did . 
  he also sent me pms telling me that psychology is a useless degree . 
  very bizarre . 
  normally i 'd be happy to play along for the sake of the joke but in context i do n't want this taking away from my message . 
  lang5t is referring to a joke in another thread . 
  i do not condone bestiality because animals ca n't consent . 
  you mean you have -7 for me or in those subreddits ? 
  that 's great , hope you feel proud . 
  that kinda defeats the purpose of pming him . 
  if i wanted everyone else to read it i would 've just said something to him there . 
  you 're pretty close to the 50k . 
  i 'll get you 1 closer . 
  i do n't think i do . 
  and no , we spoke in confidence , why would i breach that ? 
  sure , buddy . 
  tcm ? 
  also , no they do n't . 
  i 'm certain of this . 
  no offense but i dislike your mother . 
  she 's either ignorant or incredibly evil . 
  i 'm certain because i 've read a lot about this stuff . 
  i 'm at work currently so ca n't get you the exact congressional decree but i assure you there was one . 
  you know what they call alternative medicine that has been proven to work ? 
  medicine . 
  there was this tree bark that people thought helped headaches . 
  turns out it did . 
  it 's now called aspirin . 
  anything of value can and should be recreated in double blinded studies . 
  what your alternative medicine practitioners do is offer products that are n't proven to work ( read : do n't work ) . 
   tcm is still medicine just with a different fundamental science and can still be proved with it . 
  and what is this science ? 
  how is it different from `` western '' science ? 
  while this is less dangerous than cutting , it certainly does n't appear healthy . 
  you should never direct physical anger at yourself as a way of manifesting your disappointment in yourself . 
  there needs to be a law that holds `` alternative medicine practitioners '' responsible for their treatments . 
  if they make claims of being able to heal people , they should be subject to those claims and be subject to best medical standards . 
  if they 're not conforming to those standards , why the fuck should we allow them to make those claims ? 
  actually , i have . 
  do n't make assumptions . 
  i 've had well over a dozen discussions on the topic with a professional as well . 
  also , calling it medicine does n't make it so . 
  i have no issue with willow bark being used because it can be proven to work . 
  how about all the other things that ca n't ? 
  you still have n't told me how this non-western science is different . 
  i 'm more than happy to change my opinion on any medicine that you can show me works . 
  in fact , i 'd love to hear about any of it , seriously . 
  however , i ca n't condone giving unproven medicines to people . 
  please , provide me with proof and i will gladly change my stance . 
  he sure is . 
  please do n't . 
  you need professional help . 
  this is a really poor short-term solution . 
  1 ) there 's no scientific evidence of chakras . 
  2 ) acupuncture actually has failed in double blind studies where sham acupuncture is used . 
  again , if you 're able to give me a paper saying that it works i 'm happy to read it but i 've seen several that says it does n't . 
  3 ) yes , many things that do n't work have lasted a long time . 
  some of them people have been humble enough to admit were wrong once the evidence said so ( bloodletting was around for ** a long ** time before it was ousted ) . 
  4 ) `` western medicine is all about the chemical imbalances in the body , where eastern is about more than just the chemical imbalances . '', 
  that 's not really accurate at all . 
  5 ) i consider real medicine anything that can be proven to work in a double blind study . 
  double blind studies are important because giving your son herbs is an ** incredibly ** unscientific way to test things because you ca n't control for any of the thousands of confounding variables ** and ** your sample size is too small to be of any signficance . 
  i wish . 
  it very rarely catches on and 95 % of the time i do n't responds to references to my name since i get tonnes a day . 
  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  / r/askscience, 
  / r/askculinary, 
  shit . 
  i 'm noticing a theme . 
  let 's just say that i have a lot of experience in commenting . 
  i 'm still regularly surprised . 
  you 're terrible at counting . 
  i 'll upvote anything that says fuck you srs, 
  i do n't need evidence , i 'm not the one that is claiming something works . 
  you 're shifting the burden of proof . 
  personally , i would n't feel comfortable selling people health items unless i ** knew ** they worked . 
  i guess that 's the difference between me and your mum . 
  i have morals and all . 
  anyway , best of luck living with that seed of doubt , knowing that it 's likely that your mother will kill someone one day through the ignorance that you support . 
  i 've tried to order a mcchicken from kfc . 
  [ not even close ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/trapped_in_reddit ), 
  is it [ this ] ( http://farm1.staticflickr.com/29/61900756_f8f7e42c98.jpg ) ? 
  ( sfw ), 
  it has a wonderful , healthy coat . 
  please tell me that 's the day you found out your classmate had one ball . 
  a girl in my class ( about 15 years old at the time ) asked the teacher what the time was . 
  he continued talking and held out his watch . 
  she then stopped him again to say `` i ca n't read that type , what does it say ? '', 
  edit : close second - `` what 's the holocaust '' . 
  she was 21 ( different girl ) . 
  context ? 
  i read it first as `` excuse me , i have a very pretty vagina '' , as in someone decided to start a conversation with that fact .
