  it would work on me . 
  i work for a company that makes reports about medical incidents . 
  we had a call from a nurse who gave the wrong medication because `` spirits '' told her to . 
  she could see the patient 's dead father floating over the bed , telling her to give a different medication . 
  happy to read any properly performed study that says it works on horses . 
  also , if you 've got `` the sniffles '' you 're going to be better in a few days . 
  if you take a bunch of crap you do n't need , you 're just going to tax your body more or do nothing . 
  best case scenario is you 're paying a charlatan to do nothing , worse case is that you 're doing harm or delaying proper treatment . 
  i see no reason for it . 
  i 've watched a lot of his comedy and considered him to be a wonderful ally to atheism with his brand of skepticism . 
  unfortunately , he applies skepticism too strongly and too broadly and is really more of a conspiracy theorist that happens to be right about a few issues than he can be considered a skeptic . 
  there 's a huge shortage of good science writers . 
  report her again . 
  if she 's giving you a hard time for reporting her you absolutely have the right to take it further . 
  what the actual fuck, 
  wow . 
  psychotherapist who offers `` past-life regression '' . 
  trying not to get too angry . 
  it is n't work . 
  fuck i hate quacks so much . 
  so much more when they 're actually a real doctor or psychologist too . 
  have you received any yet ? 
  how far in the future do you send them ? 
  it could easily go either way . 
  it 's either going to be `` high me is hilarious '' or `` wow . 
  i 've got a problem . '', 
  that 's probably a good way of putting it . 
  how old are you ? 
  what is it ? 
  i 'm at work, 
  nothing `` cures cancer '' . 
  cancer is a very diverse type of disease so a great way to know instantly that someone is a quack is that they 'll make the claim that x can `` cure cancer '' . 
  as for that article , it basically says that mice trials showed that it * may * reduce the growth of tumors with regular use . 
  this is n't my area of expertise so please correct me if i 'm wrong but based on what i 'm reading there , it 's very , very far from saying that it helps with cancer beyond pain relief . 
  [ evidence required ], 
  i 'd panic . 
  i 'm just being honest !, 
  happy cake day , buddy .

  you do n't , you get them to seek professional help . 
  you 're not qualified to help someone who is suicidal . 
  you support them , you listen to them but your # 1 priority is getting them to someone who ** can ** help . 
  that 's fine and you should continue to support and care for him . 
  ** but ** , it 's not your responsibility . 
  you 're not trained or qualified to handle this . 
  do your best but always bring it back to professional help if you can . 
  `` bob , why do you have 4 inches written 620 times next to your fridge ? '', 
  `` no reason '', 
  hear one story from my grandfather . 
  yes , the police will tell him off for wasting their time . 
  i take my tuba to heaps of parties . 
  it 's always a hit . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_i-l4emwd4 ), 
  `` it 's not you , it 's me , i 'm just not ready for a serious relationship right now '', 
  it was really her, 
  this sounds like a conversation to have with her , not strangers on the internet . 
  you have sex drives that do n't match . 
  if the genders were reversed , you would n't consider it weird at all . 
  if this is ( or will be ) a problem for you , you should find someone new as this likely wo n't change . 
  the most important thing is to be open and honest about it , so that if there are things you can do differently , ways you can support him , you 'll be able to do that . 
  warning this post may contain science, 
  studies say that no , it does n't make you happier . 
  in fact , one huge study showed that after a year , there 's no meaningful difference in your happines if you win the lottery or ** lose a limb ** . 
  we become used to our world very quickly . 
  the best way to use money to increase your happiness is actually to give it as charity ( you get more change in happiness from giving an equivalent amount to charity instead of spending it on yourself ) . 
  also , spending money on experiences ( going to concerts etc. ), 
  gives more happiness than buying items . 
  the theory is that over time you like items less than when you bought them but memories tend to embellish over time . 
  at your age , if your mother is capable , you could easily get that changed . 
  you do n't , he 's a fictional character . 
  i 'm on track but i 'm sure i wo n't get there . 
  i hope i wo n't get there . 
  if in two years time i 'm getting close , please get me help . 
  people kept getting me confused with someone else . 
  i look very similar to my gardener . 
  is your real name blenji ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he deleted his account . 
  your parents sound incredibly immature . 
  your only job is to be the person you want to be ( keep showing them love since that 's clearly important to you ) but you ca n't control their reactions . 
  they sound like they 're being really unfair and i 'm sorry about that . 
  i 've had millions of people read what i have to say . 
  not just that but over 155000 times , someone has thought `` hmm that 's a pretty well made argument '' or `` that 's pretty funny '' or `` wow , that 's really interesting '' and gone to an effort to make sure other people see what i have to see . 
  that 's pretty fucking incredible if you think about it . 
  there is n't a trick to it . 
  it takes time and practice . 
  perhaps the issue is that you 're putting pressure on yourself to be at a certain point that you 're simply not at . 
  my advice : try to do it little bit by little bit ( think of it kind of like a phobia ) . 
  tomorrow tell a friend something that makes you a tiny bit uncomfortable , next time something a bit scarier etc. 
  if you try to be someone else all of a sudden it wo n't work . 
  you just do n't have those skills right now . 
  i know that i was never good at opening up to people and it ended in me suffering a depression . 
  i did n't know how to tell my family that i was n't coping . 
  i did n't know i was n't coping . 
  the amazing thing that i learned once i did start opening up to people was that they 're just as scared as i was . 
  in fact , half the time they were grateful that i opened up first because they really wanted to get some stuff off their chest too . 
  i 'm still not great at it ( my so would definitely agree ) and that 's just who i am , it 's just how i learned to deal . 
  but , you can ** definitely ** get better over time . 
  lastly , it 's probably worth trying to work out what scares you about your emotions ( there 's a reason you do n't have access to them ) , whether that 's by yourself or with a therapist . 
  one thing that would definitely help , start meditating .
