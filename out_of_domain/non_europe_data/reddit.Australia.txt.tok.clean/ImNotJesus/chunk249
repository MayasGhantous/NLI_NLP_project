  it 's had incredible research results over the last 10 years and has definitely helped me reduce my own anxieties about being vulnerable .

  they have a heap of info about the research and some guided meditations you can try . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : time and patience . 
  you need to develop the skills . 
  exactly and the people who are assholes , you 're better off knowing that about them anyway . 
  parents who hit their kids . 
  i know that being against that is a very unpopular view on reddit but i do n't care . 
  the research says that it 's not just a very poor behaviour modification strategy , it also has a bunch of side effects ( like hurting the relationship and increasing the child 's aggression ) . 
  i know that i 'm about to get a bunch of messages starting with `` i was hit as a child and i turned out okay '' but there 's a reason that the scientific method is used and not people 's own subjective experience of their childhood . 
  the evidence is that it does n't work . 
  your experience may be different but it does n't change the science . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) is a link to a huge meta-analysis on the topic . 
  i think grounding used to be more effective when people did n't have access to the entire world on a mobile phone . 
  according to a couple of iq tests it 's about 99.75 %, 
  one day . 
  we were really busy yesterday . 
  my mum almost never yelled at me . 
  when she was all of a sudden serious , i knew that i 'd ** really ** fucked up . 
  i would n't touch that hand , i know where it 's been . 
  is it too tight ? 
  try a bigger size . 
  also , it 's very possible that it 's mental . 
  here 's the proof . 
  sometimes people use a condom and it breaks half way through but they finish because they do n't realise . 
  if it was that amazingly different , you would notice . 
  you may want to x-post to / r/asksocialscience, 
  yes, 
  if you have a severe phobia and it 's affecting your life , you should speak to a psychologist about it . 
  \u25e6 no yes/no answer questions . 
  daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  a basic understanding of psychology would tell you that the idea of a utopia is a silly one . 
  i started writing a story i knew i 'd never show anyone . 
  the idea was that it was the story of my life had i taken the other path ( not getting help for my depression ) . 
  it was a really interesting experience . 
  see a psychologist , not psychatrist . 
  psychologists do n't prescribe medication . 
  you can do what 's called systematic desensitisation with one and it works very well . 
  alternatively , try to start meditating . 
  it 's been shown to have a huge impact on anxiety .

  5 minuets a day will change your life . 
  haha, 
  i 'm pretty close to cracking the top 20 for comment . 
  just a friendly reminder , no surnames or personally identifying info please . 
  no problems at all , happy to help  let me know if you need any more . 
  meeting my so . 
  i 'm sorry that 's so sappy . 
  at a music festival there was one stage where they had a daily `` jam '' where you sign up and they pair you with other musos and you jam on stage . 
  i decided to try this . 
  i 'd been playing drums for a couple of years but did n't play with anyone . 
  i did n't realise this was a problem until i got on stage and all of a sudden got really , really nervous . 
  the entire band stopped and started clicking the beat to me . 
  also , embarrassing bodies is the best show ever . 
  the idea that people have weird issues that they 're too worried to tell their doctor about but think `` hey , i guess it 'd be alright if the world saw my scabby genitals '' is just magnificent . 
  does n't the glass banging into your teeth hurt ? 
  surely a toothbrush would be more effective . 
  i like your assumption that it will happen . 
  i 'd give a huge proportion of it away . 
  no-one ever needs anywhere near that much money . 
  ** disclaimer : i have no issue with weed , i have issue with constant use of weed . 
  i think that it 's a bit like alcohol . 
  if you drink a little bit here and there and do n't drink too much , it 's enjoyable . 
  if you do it every day and get yourself fucked up , it will change your life . 
  not just that but you start to convince yourself that it 's okay . 
  i used to smoke . 
  a lot . 
  every day . 
  and let 's just say that it was n't good for me . 
  the moral of the story is this : in moderation , weed is fun . 
  if used to excess , it can hurt you . 
  it 's not going to kill you from an overdose but it will drastically change your life . 
  many of the ways that it changes you will feel normal at the time and you wo n't realise until you 're clean how much it was affecting you . 
  makes sense . 
  yes it is because neither of those will help you cope . 
  in fact , they 'll both make you go backwards because you 'll hate yourself for it . 
  things are really tough right now and i 'm sorry for that but what you really need is to work through this . 
  you do n't want to get drunk , you do n't want to smoke , you just want the hurting to stop and there are ways to do that without going backwards . 
  if you wake up tomorrow morning with a hangover nothing will have changed except your view of yourself . 
  if you wake up tomorrow morning having talked to some friends about your upset or having done some exercise or meditating or whatever it is you can use to cope , you 'll feel a little bit better . 
  it may only be 1 % but it 'll mean you 're one step closer . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  you can absolutely do better . 
  no-one deserves to feel that way , ever . 
  if he makes you feel that way he does n't deserve * you * . 
  that seems like a terrible , terrible idea . 
  why do n't you make an appointment to speak to a counsellor or psychologist before making any life changing decisions like that . 
  it seems like you know it 's a bad idea . 
  get new friends . 
  the single best thing you can do for the world is love the shit out of your kids . 
  if you show your kids unconditional love , they 'll do the same to their kids and their kids down the generations . 
  as per usual , good science is the answer . 
  even if you do n't , who the fuck would do that ? 
  i 'd give him the benefit of the doubt and talk to him about it . 
  he may not have done anything and if you confront him ( in a really , really friendly way ) and just say that you 've appreciated your time there but it 's time for you to move on , he may not do it again . 
  you know why i could n't worship you and you also know that i devoted my life to helping people . 
  if the criteria is reverence , i wo n't make the cut . 
  if it 's living a life worth living , i 'm in .
