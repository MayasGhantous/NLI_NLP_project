  yes but certain things are more insidious in becoming addictions . 
  yeh , there are much better ways to gain control . 
  yes , it 's called / r/asksocialscience, 
  exactly . 
  say what you want about religion but the fact is that ** today ** it 's a personal thing . 
  no two `` christians '' believe the same thing . 
  if you identify and want to be a christian that 's fine . 
  if you find that certain parts do n't fit with your worldview and you decide to be a good person over following something you do n't believe dogmatically , you 're doing it right . 
  i think that anyone who has actually experienced love would know that it 's a stupid idea . 
  first sight is attraction , love is much more complicated and deep than that . 
  if you think you can love someone without knowing them , you do n't know what love is . 
  probably cry a lot, 
  well there 's your first problem , you still think of her as the `` one '' . 
  the one is a silly concept . 
  if there really was a one , think about how incredibly unlikely it is that you 'd ever actually meet her . 
  finding someone you want to spend your life with is n't some magical thing where some perfectly matched person falls into your lap . 
  love is hard , it 's complicated and it takes sacrifice and communication . 
  you can find someone else that you 'd be happy to spend your life with . 
  everyone is scared of pretty similar things . 
  everyone wants to be loved and worries that they wo n't be/can ' t be . 
  everyone wants to find happiness but is n't totally sure how . 
  that guy is such an asshole . 
  if there 's any day where you 're allowed to choose whatever you want , it 's your wedding day . 
  be kinds about it but be honest . 
  say no . 
  yes but it would be different . 
  ** this is a very complex question that we do n't really know all the answers to . 
  therefore , anyone in this post who claims to have a definitive answer is talking out of their ass . 
  we 'd need to have a much better knowledge of consciousness to completely answer it but i think there 's sufficient knowledge to say that language is a way to understand thoughts but it 's not the only way . 
  it also really depends on how you define thinking . 
  are unconscious processes thinking or is it only things that come into our conscious awareness ? 
  if you have n't been thinking about something consciously and it pops into your head out of nowhere , we can still show that you were thinking about it , even if you were n't consciously aware . 
  i had double depression ( disthymia with major depressive episodes ) and i 'm out the other side . 
  there is hope , even though it does n't feel like it at the time . 
  stay strong , pal . 
  i was on anti-depressants for two stints ( about 3 months and 1 month ) in the time i was struggling to cope most . 
  i was lucky in that my mother was incredibly supportive and basically let me live at home and do nothing while i got through the worst of it . 
  if you 're not in the situation and need to cope with the outside world more , anti-depressants may be more important . 
  i know how hopeless it felt at the time but it wo n't always feel that way . 
  like all emotions , it comes and goes with time . 
  i 'm actually studying psychology now because i want to help people like me . 
  for example , you 're not allowed to turn on/off a light on the sabbath but there 's no reason you ca n't set a timer or have a non-jewish friend do it . 
  how infants think is n't really that clear . 
  it 's very clear that babies are born with innate rules that they understand . 
  a 30 * minute * old baby can recognise some very basic patterns . 
  however , it 's hard to say that they have thoughts as such . 
  it really depends on how you define thinking . 
  there 's no ** should ** about feelings . 
  if it bothers you , it bothers you and you 're allowed to say something about it . 
  he 's allowed to decide whether or not that 's something he wants to change about himself . 
  if he does stop , that 's easy , if he does n't want to , then you have to decide how important it is to you . 
  it 's the year 0 . 
  a man living in rome ca n't control the miracles he 's doing . 
  he wants to be a normal boy but everytime he touches water , it turns to wine . 
  now , his life is in danger as the romans comes after him . 
  all he can do is yell ** im not jesus ** . 
  why do n't you ask * those * mods ? 
  so you 're saying that if it were possible to get an international agreement ( i accept that this is incredibly unlikely ) it could potentially be valuable but without that there 's no way anyone would implement it because it would hurt their own economy too much ? 
  which part precisely ? 
  yes but i do n't think the point of this picture is to say that they 're identical , it 's to question the way we treat people with those disorders . 
  whether or not you think someone deserves to be depressed because they 've made mistakes ( long argument for another time ) , we should treat them with the same compassion that we would give to anyone with a physical illness . 
  as for your first point , i completely agree that adhd over-diagnosis is a problem . 
  again , this does n't invalidate the message . 
  just because some guy fakes the flu to get out of work , that does n't mean the flu is any less real or unpleasant to have . 
  this is n't about problems with diagnosis ( i agree there are a few ) , this is about treating people the right way . 
  i never said it was true for everyone . 
  op asked for personal experiences , that 's what i gave . 
  there are a tonne of courses you can do online . 
  check out itunes u. i 'd recommend the berkeley ones , there 's heaps of choice . 
  that really depends on how you define a broken mind . 
  no-one is saying that dangerous people should n't be locked up . 
  except that her concern was that someone who had x illness was just walking around , not that the person had x illness and was dangerous . 
  the comic was commenting on the assumption that all people with x illness are dangerous , which i assume you know is n't true . 
  i do n't think any rational person thinks that your boyfriend 's coworker should n't be locked up, 
  i want to mention two important concepts . 
  the first is cognitive dissonance . 
  the basic idea is that our brains prefer for all of the information to line up neatly . 
  we like certainty and rules , not uncertainty about what is right and wrong . 
  as a result , our brains go through processes of evaluative loading to try and square the circles that do n't fit . 
  the second concept is heuristics . 
  heuristics are essentially short-cuts that we use for thinking that are based on rules . 
  for example , if i asked you which there was more of , words that begin with the letter r or words that had it as the third letter . 
  your brain would subconsciously run through examples and because more came to mind , you 'd say first letter . 
  this is wrong in this situation but for most situations , having a rule that says `` if it comes to mind easily it 's more common '' is a good rule to have . 
  so , that brings us to your motorbike riding . 
  you have to constantly make decisions that weigh up options that have costs and benefits . 
  if you go between the cars you 'll get there quicker but there 's a small change you 'll get hurt/killed . 
  now , you 're going to use heuristics and cognitive biases to make snap decisions because you ca n't possibly weigh up all the alternatives each time you get a red light . 
  so , we know that you 're going to make a snap decision based on imperfect rules . 
  after you 've made that decision , cognitive dissonance kicks in . 
  you do n't want to think of yourself as having made a stupid decision so you evaluatively laod the decision you made as the right one , making you more likely to do it in the future . 
  edit : my description of cognitive dissonance was probably too narrow but i chose brevity for that example . 
  it 's a little more complicated when discussing ideas but the basic gist is the same , we like continuity and rules . 
   it is hard to not let that sully your judgement . 
  that 's the entire point that the comic is addressing . 
  let 's say that we could empirically prove that white people were more likely to commit murders and this was a well-known fact . 
  it would be easy , but wrong , to let that sully your judgement of all white people . 
  you ca n't do anything with just a psych degree , you need a masters/phd/doctorate, 
  this is true . 
  i 'm not saying he should do one or the other , just saying that it 's a longer commitment for psych but you can definitely get work with it .
