  your dream meant that your prefrontal cortex was n't as functional as during waking times because you were asleep . 
  do n't overthink it . 
  i found it on / r/depression in the / top section . 
  i sincerely hope that you do n't believe that telling someone to `` snap out of it '' can cure a mental illness . 
  of course the way people are treated matters and there may be some situations where tough love are necessary . 
  there are also plenty of situations where compassion and support are more appropriate . 
  of course , that depends on the context and the illness . 
  telling someone with schizophrenia to `` snap out of it '' will be just as successful as doing the same to someone with cancer . 
  giving someone with depression some tough love ** may ** ( in some situations ) help them face their illness in the same way that giving an obese a kick up the bum may help them exercise . 
  you certainly ca n't cure either with it though . 
  in that case i 'm very glad you 're not a therapist . 
   i think general education , better medications , and better equipped professionals are needed in order to adequately treat the needs of people with serious bipolar issues . 
  i completely agree and the same can be said for all mental illnesses . 
   what i am trying to say ( and i think you understand ) is that it is n't as black and white as locking up bipolars , but at the same time to say that we need to exert caution around people with mental illness is n't bigoted . 
  again , i agree ( to some extent - there 's a line between caution and bigotry ) and i 'm not saying we should live in a naive world where everything is wonderful . 
  but a horror version !, 
  you lack of understanding about mental illness is incredibly apparent in this and you 're also arguing against a strawman . 
  i 've never said that we should condescend to mentally ill people , that 's absurd . 
  the ** entire ** point of the comic is to say that we need to treat them like people , not social pariahs who are unable to function . 
  as i said in another response to you : i 've never said that we should condescend to mentally ill people , that 's absurd . 
  the ** entire ** point of the comic is to say that we need to treat them like people , not social pariahs who are unable to function . 
  no-one is talking about excusing behaviour , it 's about having compassion for them i the same way you would someone with any physical illness and understanding that you ** ca n't ** just `` snap out of it '' . 
  if you could , why the hell would anyone choose to stay depressed ? 
  it 's a terrible thing to live through . 
  which part exactly ? 
  i 'd, 
  be happy to be disproven if you have any evidence . 
  how did you get * that * out of it ? 
  i think it 's somewhat overdiagnosed but not nearly as badly as others think it is . 
  there are some legitimate theorists who do n't even think it 's a real disoder ( i thoroughly disagree ) . 
  because i do n't !, 
  no problems at all !, 
  meditation is n't about stopping conscious awareness , it 's about stopping it from moving around . 
  the idea is that you focus on one thing ( like your breath ) and maintain that . 
  you ca n't shut off consciousness . 
  but you can , at least temporarily , retain focus on a singular sensation . 
  in which case it should be prescribed by a doctor , as with any other legitimate medication . 
  despite how popular it is on reddit , i hope that no-one actually thinks that more people smoking weed is actually a ** good ** thing . 
  you can say it is n't that dangerous or people who have the freedom to do it but it 's not ** good ** for people . 
  please note : i 'm not saying that legalising it would ** necessarily ** increase consumption . 
  itt a whole lot of very pro-legalisation people downvoting every idea . 
  we get it , legalisation is a common position on reddit , that 's not the point of this thread . 
  if you 're downvoting people 's suggestions because you disagree with them , we get no discussion . 
  we can focus the stream on a single point ( with practise ) , we ca n't stop the stream from being there , that 's called a coma . 
  you know what 's much better at relieving stress - regular exercise and meditation . 
  try meditating . 
  it 's been shown to be incredibly effective in study after study . 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to say or what your concern is with what i said . 
  please explain in what way . 
  the entire reason i posted this comic is because i want more respect shown to mentally ill people . 
  i do n't really get why you think i 'm condescending and offensive since it 's very puzzling to me . 
   and some mental problems can be successfully cured by forcing yourself if their root is not a mental degeneration . 
  and you think i 'm offensive ? 
  what the fuck . 
  i thought this was a psychology subreddit and you start spouting that unscientific bullshit . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  some theorists say extreme things for attention . 
  when did i say that that 's why it should be illegal . 
  you have absoltely no idea what my position is . 
  makes me feel a bit better about it getting relatively ignored in this thread . 
  it 's not a sexy answer , just a true one . 
  i had a lot of spare time at work today . 
  it left me a bitter . 
  very bitter . 
  check [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/tvaiz/what_if_we_treated_every_illness_the_way_we_treat/c4q4ns4?context=3 ) out . 
  your kudos really helped . 
  haha, 
  normally it 's not this bad , it just got popular very quickly and the sensible answers got buried . 
  happens sometimes . 
  you 're welcome to believe that , it just has no scientific basis . 
  sorry , there may be some cases where the sufferer believes that 's what happened , that does n't mean it 's scientifically valid and i would hope that as a neuroscience major you 'd understand that one person 's subjective experience of their own disease ( that affects perception ) is n't really more valid than the wealth of scientific knowledge on the topic . 
  i 'm actually qualified to perform surgery because i met a surgeon once . 
  true story . 
  you may not realise this but some people are attracted to men . 
  some of those people enjoy seeing penises . 
  weird right ? 
   ** some of those people **, 
  me saying his argument is invalid , does n't mean that i take the opposite position . 
  sorry if i came off as hostile but i get really shitty when people put words in my mouth . 
  changing the lives of the people around me . 
  i want to be on my deathbed and know the world was a better place for me having existed . 
  your friend acted like a drunken dick . 
  ** however ** , at the end of the day , if your girlfriend wants to take her top off that 's her choice . 
  if you 're not okay with it , it 's something to discuss with her , not your friend . 
  yes . 
  as i said , it 's a dick thing to do and i think it 's completely disrespectful . 
  have one back . 
  shit . 
  i thought i had a chance with you, 
  you 're missing a whole range of important phenomena when you say they just `` grew out of it '' though . 
  there are a lot of variables that the sufferer may not have even been aware of . 
  also , individual cases of remission over time does n't mean that one can essentially choose to `` snap out '' of a depression . 
  if that were possible , therapists would be out of jobs because everyone would just choose to do so . 
  as someone who also suffered from depression and fought like hell to get rid of it , i assure you it is n't that easy . 
  as for misdiagnosis , that 's a completely separate issue and i 'm happy to enter into that if you want but i do n't think it 's related here . 
  some guys are okay with that situation . 
  i 'm not judging or telling him what he should do . 
  if she wants to take her top off in public and he 's okay with it , it 's great that they found each other . 
  if he 's not okay with it , that 's a problem ( assuming she 's unwilling to stop for him ) . 
  fair,
