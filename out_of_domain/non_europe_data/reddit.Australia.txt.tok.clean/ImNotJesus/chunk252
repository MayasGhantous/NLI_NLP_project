  that being said , i obviously come from a psych not neuro background but if you have any papers on growing out of depression i 'd be interested to read them . 
  psychology , sorry . 
   psychology is pretty much based on ideology even today . 
  besides the whole homosexaulity = mental illness thing there is also the adhd = lazyness one . 
  wow . 
  for a comment in / r/skeptic this is horribly incorrect and anti-science . 
  i do n't really see the problem with a comic trying to raise awareness about what it 's like to suffer from a mental illness and have people think that it 's `` not a real thing '' or something that you can `` snap out of '' . 
  why would you say that asking for better understanding of mental illness in the public means that those who supported that post are people who know nothing about psychology ? 
  yes and that 's why teachers do n't diagnose and prescribe medication . 
  all the more reason we need better psychology education . 
  bravo . 
  i 'm surprised by how often a bit more skepticism is required in this subreddit . 
  tir is everyone, 
  i found out my friend 's account so i went through his user page and upvoted everything for a few pages , hoping it would make his day to all of a sudden see a bunch more karma ( he did n't have much ) . 
  turns out , upvoting/downvoting someone 's user page does nothing :(, 
  you should try making a modpost . 
  it takes days to clean out my inbox, 
  me and a friend logged onto another friend 's msn messenger and talked to a girl he liked . 
  we thought it was funny at the time but we caused a huge fight between them . 
  felt bad . 
  yes . 
  it 's to stop `` drive-by '' downvoting . 
  i 'm still not sure why i go on there , i always regret it but i keep going back . 
  i ca n't tell if this is a joke or if you genuinely think that that 's johnny depp, 
  i do n't care about the karma , i care about proliferating bullshit . 
  upvotes make it more visible . 
  edit : retracted, 
  making a post about the rules as a mod . 
  thanks for that and i apologise if i misjudged you . 
  i think that if it 's not totally clear , it 's probably best for op to point at that they 're posting it as an example of poor reporting because i worry that readers who do n't know as much about psychology may have taken it at face value . 
  i guess your last point is correct , when i logged on this morning the post was 8 hours old and there was almost nothing on what a terrible article it was . 
  it 's funny , i was actually the one who posted that comic on / r/psychology yesterday and the amount of ignorance about psychology in ** that ** subreddit is pretty disgusting . 
  with enough time the votes sorted it out but i was getting downvoted for saying that people ca n't just choose to `` snap out '' of mental illness at will . 
  what . 
  hopefully it would cause a lot of who 's on first style confusion . 
  well said !, 
  you stop getting that with some more karma and a verified email address . 
  he 's right . 
  i looked carefully and also could n't see it . 
  you also need sufficient karma . 
  when you get enough to can trade it in at the store . 
  i 've almost got enough for the reddit snowglobe . 
  terrible novelty . 
  just stop . 
  terrible . 
  not sure sorry, 
  12 songs,

  plus , her side of the bed is better ( she has the laptop tray ) so i enjoy the chance to use it . 
  put up with me, 
  whatever is popular is 2214, 
  actually she 's pretty cool . 
  not sure how i tricked her into being with me but i 'm just going with it . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  talk to a lawyer, 
  both, 
  when you think of evolution , it 's better not to think is such precise terms . 
  i think it 'd be hard to justify a `` depression gene '' . 
  however , you can see how there 'd be benefit in being slightly more self-critical than others , perhaps in a good situation it allows you to improve but when the situation is overwhelming it becomes even more so . 
  an easier example is anxiety . 
  anxiety is good , it 's important . 
  if you do n't have it , you do n't function very well . 
  ** but ** , too much of it is also debilitating . 
  evolution is n't a fine process that makes everything perfect , it 's gross steps that slightly advantage one gene over another that ** over time ** leads to changes that are ** more useful than not ** . 
  i like this idea, 
  but i want to get you started on fruit stocks, 
   every other fringe subculture is tolerated . 
  uhhhh, 
  also , there 's a difference between finding something funny and not tolerating it . 
  sounds like you 're the asshole if you 're enjoying this . 
  i know he was being insensitive but he 's actually trying really hard to support you ( in his own misguided way ) . 
  he loves you and wants you to be happy/healthy and this actually seems like a good way to do it - you get added motivation and he 's willing to go on walks with you . 
  plus , he 's going to try and lose weight too . 
   paychotherapy, 
  excuse me sir but you seem to have slipped on a freudian . 
  you can give people information about therapy ( different types , what to expect , average prices etc. ), 
  without giving direct medical advice . 
  first time i 've found someone reposting something i posted !, 
  best part , [ i took it from another subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hv77v/a_mythbusters_comic/c1ymwgy ) . 
  first half of that movie , awesome . 
  second half , horrific . 
  chunky pumpkin and chilli soup, 
  yeh , i 'm really annoyed that / r/academicpsychology did n't really take off . 
  did we just become best friends ? 
  this was on the front page a few days ago and it was removed then too ( not by me that time ) . 
  askreddit is n't for asking to change other subreddits . 
  if you want to change other subreddits , contact the moderators there . 
  well , there are lots of factors in succeeding in school and onwards . 
  they 're all partly genetic , partly your environment and partly your psychological well-being . 
  you share half of your sister 's genes so it 's likely that your iqs are n't * that * different but they may very well be . 
  beyond that , there are lots of reasons that she could be doing better . 
  she may enjoy working hard more that you . 
  additionally , she may simply be more skilled/practised at it . 
  she could be more motivated to work towards what she wants . 
  she may have specific strengths in areas that she 's using to her advantage whereas you 're not working in areas of strength . 
  alternatively , there could be psychological reasons . 
  for example , if you 're depressed it could explain a lack of motivation to succeed . 
  anxiety could stop you from trying since you fear failure . 
  you could even have a learning disability and not realise it .
