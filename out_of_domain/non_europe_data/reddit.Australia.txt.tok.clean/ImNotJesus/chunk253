  the point is , i could give you 100 reasons and i 'd be pulling them all out of my ass without knowing you or her . 
  ** if you really struggle with understanding/reading/remembering things ** , you should looking into getting psychometric testing done ( basically iq testing done by a psychologist who can look at your strengths and weaknesses ) . 
  ** if you feel like emotional reasons hold you back ** it may be worth talking to a therapist about it . 
  ** if you struggle with focussing or staying on one task ** learn to meditate , it will train your brain ( actually causing changes in the size/shape of areas ) to focus on one thing better . 
  click [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu.au ) for more info and some guided meditations . 
  beyond that , if you have any specific concerns , let me know and i may be able to steer you in the right direction . 
  in psychology , aaron t beck has probably been the most influential person in the last 50 years but most do n't know his name . 
  he developed cognitive behavioural therapy , the most commonly used therapy right now . 
  i outpace pretty much every non-novelty ( or neiltyson ) but i 'm not even going to try to keep up with you . 
  what + do you have him as ? 
  thanks pal !, 
  it 's funny , i think i 'm the least known for the amount of karma ( except as a mod ) . 
  not complaining , just think it 's funny . 
  how long do you think it is until you pass andrew ? 
  i ca n't handle the new queue in funny/pics . 
  i know there 's heaps of karma there but it hurts my brain too much , even using rising . 
  fluid intelligence - ability to reason/manipulate mentally . 
  crystallised intelligence - memory of facts/information . 
  hahaha actually nothing is worse than the new queue in adviceanimals . 
  every time something new hits the front page you see 40 different attempts to make the same joke about it . 
  you 're referring to what 's called `` g '' and you 're correct . 
  * you 're at 10 after upvoting that comment . 
  that 's true . 
  askreddit is hard to predict but it 's where i get almost all of mine from ( 111629/159806 ) but there 's tonnes of 5-10s that would 've been a lot more if they hit the frontpage . 
  but , when a post hits fast and you 're in early , you can get 5k from one post . 
  plus , i generally find it the most satisfying ( after askscience , explainlikeimfive , asksocialscience and askculinary ), 
  fluid generalises better and it predicts performance on other tests so i 'd say fluid but you ca n't completely separate them . 
  and then reading through the 50 abusive messages from people who completely ignored half of what you said and got angry at you . 
  edit : so what you 're saying is that if i want to catch up to you , i should ban you from askreddit ? 
  my jewish dad is super tight with money . 
  i 'll just retaliate by banning you from / r/nazidressups, 
  probably panic, 
  snap !, 
  what am i on ? 
  james earl jones reads all of the comments to me . 
  it makes redditting 400 % better . 
  you ca n't post pictures in askreddit , it 's self-posts ( words ) only . 
  you can add a picture in the description part , look at the `` formatting help '' button for more info . 
  * blushes *, 
  i have someone that follows me around and makes fun of my psychology degree . 
  it 's hilarious because everyone else just thinks he 's an idiot and downvotes him . 
  does n't stop him from trying though , got ta give him that . 
  ca n't it be both . 
  beads, 
  i hate the way americans say aluminium . 
  it 's alumin ** i ** um , not aluminam . 
  also , you guys ca n't spell . 
  it 's colour , favour etc. 
  i mean this in the nicest way possible but if you think you 're in love with someone you know for a month , you do n't really understand love . 
  i told my current partner that i loved her after 2 weeks . 
  we 're still together and i do indeed love her now , but after 2 weeks i had no idea what love was . 
  a month is infatuation . 
  it 's attraction . 
  it 's a flood of dopamine and it feels fantastic . 
  love is messy . 
  it 's scary and it 's ambivalent . 
  you ca n't love someone unless you know them better than yourself . 
  that 's why i use chrome , it leads people to think i can spell better than i can . 
  if only it underlined all my bad jokes too . 
  thanks ? 
   i suffer from ibs, 
   otherwise i feel like shit, 
  too easy . 
  i 'm really severely lactose intolerant . 
  the problem is that it does n't hurt until like 30 minutes later so when i start eating the icecream , it 's all good . 
  30 minutes later and all hell breaks loose . 
  you 'll get some wonderful , supportive responses . 
  i 'd also expect some people to tag you as `` shoots blanks '' and reply that to just about every one of your comments . 
  reddit , like any group of millions of people , will have some lovely people and some fucking assholes . 
  try to remember the nice ones in a few hours when you inbox is full of hate and bullshit, 
  [ that 's racist ] ( http://anongallery.org/img/8/7/thats-racist.gif ), 
  i think being an adult is the moment that you accept that you 'll never really feel like what a kid pictures an adult as . 
  i can see them riding in on their high horses . 
  [ this ] ( http://tvontv.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/modern-family-send-out-the-clowns.jpg ) is what girls with too much makeup look like to me . 
  it 's so bad for me but so god damn delicious . 
  not even close . 
  i wish srs was a really well run subreddit , i really do . 
  i think it would be wonderful to have a place where we call out the horrific things that ** sometimes ** get upvoted . 
  that 's not what srs is though . 
  srs is some weird meta-circlejerk that lost its grip on reality a long time ago . 
  it 's frustrating . 
  have n't tried in ages , sorry . 
  i get that a lot . 
  i think that 's the right attitude to have . 
  bravo to you , sir or madam . 
  no-one who would abandon their kids deserves to have them in their life and the joys that it can bring . 
  i do n't care about what they think/say , i just care that it could have been a great place ( like / r/panichistory which is fucking hilarious ) . 
  also , they have a tendency to take things waaaaay too far and cause drama in other subreddits . 
  hold on , he has a mandate to be a representative ** and ** to uphold the constitution . 
  we are certainly not a christian nation . 
  i have no issue with him representing his constituency , as long as it 's in keeping with the laws of the nation . 
  if he wants to change that , he 's welcome to try and get a referendum called challenging section 116 . 
  not as far as i know, 
  i would be honoured buccie . 
  i think you 're misunderstanding me , i apologise if i was n't clear . 
  i 'm not challenging his right of free speech . 
  i 'm challenging his accuracy and also saying that i do n't agree with his message . 
  i never said that he should be censored , i 'm talking about his repsonsibility ** as ** a representative to act within the constitution . 
  to say we are a christian nation is idiotic . 
  i defend his right to say it , i just think he 's an idiot .
