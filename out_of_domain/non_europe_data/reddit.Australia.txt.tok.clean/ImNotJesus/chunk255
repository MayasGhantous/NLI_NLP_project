  taking out the world `` legally '' does n't make it any different . 
  if you want advice , talk to a lawyer or the police station to find out your rights . 
  yeh , if you do n't notice 70k going into your account with no reason why , you 're either easily rich enough to pay it back or clearly lying . 
  the fact that the bank made a mistake is no more relevant than if you accidentally leave your bag on the bus and i take it . 
  taking shit that is n't yours is taking shit that is n't yours . 
  no , no . 
  i hit 150k total from the same post that got me to 100k from askreddit alone . 
  best day i 've had is about 10k probs, 
  you said :, 
   enacting laws that push a christian agenda may run counter to the spirit of the constitution , but he 's not introducing bills to parliament with this speech . 
  he 's just having a rant . 
  in response to me saying :, 
   to be clear , i have no problem with him ** saying ** / thinking/believing anything he wants . 
  ** i have no issue with him saying whatever he wants ** . 
  he can rant all he fucking likes . 
  i have n't once said that he ca n't . 
  i do n't understand where you 're coming from or what you think you 're arguing against, 
  you 'd be surprised how often that bombs, 
  i think people miss the reference . 
  it 's like 50/50 from my experience . 
  most of the time i just do n't respond when people reference my username, 
  i do n't keep track really , just estimating . 
  17,884 is pretty good . 
  man . 
  there are two reasons that you 're getting downvoted and neither of them are to do with partisanship . 
  1 ) you 're acting like a dick, 
  2 ) you repeatedly tell me what my position is and ignore all my responses trying to clarify . 
  you 're trying to win an argument against someone who is n't trying to argue with you . 
  i 'm not going to respond to you again because it 's pointless . 
  internet explorer 7, 
  my teenage years, 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.google.com.au/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;q=receipt+etymology ), 
  i listened to him on wtf just yesterday actually , made him seem very human . 
  here 's a tip from behavioural economist dan ariely . 
  put it in a glass of water and stick it in the freezer . 
  if you want to use it , you 'll have to wait for it to thaw out . 
  if you still want to use it after that wait , you can . 
  re-freeze after using it . 
  the biggest issue with ccs is spending above your means . 
  if you make yourself wait to make `` cold '' decisions ( hot cognition = thinking with emotion , cold = not emotional , sorry about the pun ) , you 're unlikely to let your cc ruin your life . 
  this really works !, 
  i used my 14th cc to buy my car that i live in to evade the debt collectors . 
  edit : if anyone asks , my name is miguel sanchez, 
  about 10 seconds before i told my so that i love her . 
  it was the moment that i realised i did . 
  hey , wan na go out sometime ? 
  want me to ban you from askreddit ? 
  also , there 's a program that you can use to block it , i ca n't remember the name but it 's a chrome plug-in . 
  i downloaded it , have never used it . 
  edit : [ link ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji ), 
  dinner : sam harris . 
  immensely interesting and would be fascinating to talk to ( partly because i do n't agree with him on a lot of topics ) . 
  drunk : ricky gervais , he 'd be hilarious after a few glasses of wine . 
  sex : my so . 
  sorry , lame answer but i really do n't * want * to sleep with anyone else . 
  you want to microwave your credit card ? 
  good luck with that . 
  his wife for all 3, 
  you 'd have sex with a dead philosopher ? 
  please go to the police , this is n't appropriate for askreddit .

  please contact a lawyer . 
  just because your parents do n't have a happy marriage , it does n't mean that all marriages are unhappy . 
  one day , i sincerely hope you find someone that you can be close to . 
  to have someone to care for you , to love you , to share your life with , to take care of and love back , is a wonderful thing . 
  it 's not about avoiding loneliness , it 's about the incredible positives that can come out of sharing your life with someone . 
  listen to me very carefully . 
  i want you to close your eyes ( once you finish reading this obviously ) and start trying to take really nice deep breaths . 
  on each breath i want you to try and notice where you feel the breath ( in your nose ? 
  in your stomach ? 
  ) , just stay with the sensation wherever it takes you . 
  keep breathing and feeling as long as necessary . 
  if you notice yourself concentrating on something else , just calmly redirect your focus back to your breath . 
  it 's normal and will happen . 
  i guarantee you that this will help and the feeling will pass, 
  wow . 
  wow . 
  i like it . 
  how many potatoes does it take to kill an irishman ? 
  [ none ] ( / spoiler ), 
  thanks for explaining the joke . 
  i was really confused about what he meant . 
  i 've got a double for you . 
  when i was about 7 my sister and i were being driven home by a babysitter . 
  she ran a red light , hitting a car which caused us to spin and hit a traffic light . 
  the traffic light went through the side of the car , behind the passenger seat . 
  if i was sitting there instead of the middle seat , i would 've died . 
  also , after the accident a nice man came up and asked if he could help , my babysitter said `` here , these are n't my kids , can you take them home to their mother ? '', 
  luckily he was a nice guy but that could 've gone really bad . 
  edit : typo, 
  i 'd like to think it 'll be something profound or something like `` i love you '' but it 'll probably be `` ouch '', 
  when you 're at the vet . 
  not before or after, 
  1 ) i regularly donate blood/plasma, 
  2 ) i 'm studying to be a therapist so i can help people . 
  3 ) i regularly make an effort to make the lives of those around me easier .
