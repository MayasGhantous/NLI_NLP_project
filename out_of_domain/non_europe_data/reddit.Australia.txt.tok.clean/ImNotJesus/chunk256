  4 ) i give to charity, 
  5 ) i try to educate people about science and mental health whenever i can, 
  if by luck you mean sometimes good shit happens and sometimes bad shit happens , it exists . 
  statistically speaking , it 's likely that more good shit happens to some people and more bad shit happens to other people but there is n't some sort of force deciding which you get . 
  i do n't think it would be appropriate for jesus to donate blood . 
  i 'm terrified of heights . 
  story : when i was 4 , my dad was doing his usually terrible job of supervising me when i climbed to the top of his truck and jumped off , yelling `` daddy catch me . '', 
  he did not catch me , the concrete did though . 
  spent the rest of the day puking after a quick trip to the hospital . 
  i 'll be your friend . 
  hi , i 'm notjesus , nice to meet you . 
  i went head first into concrete . 
  i was about 3 metres high , it 's a fairly big truck . 
  self-control is a finite resource and clearly people do n't always exercise it . 
  sometimes letting your non-impulsive brain make some rules for your impulsive brain is okay . 
  have you considered that you might be a bit too quiet if he 's asking ? 
  i do n't think you need to stop and have a conversation but it 's better to ask and do what you like than keep doing something you do n't like . 
  does n't that mean the rohypnol is still working ? 
  i realised that my mother became pregnant with me only a few weeks after my sister died . 
  she said that she wanted me but i know that there 's no way that anyone going through that sort of grief can make that decision . 
  i know she loves me and i know she 's glad to have me but realising that fucked me up for quite a while . 
  hard not to feel like the replacement child . 
  generally good but that took some getting over . 
  it actually all came to a head about 3 days before i started exams a few years ago , was ** not ** easy concentrating haha . 
  how is that semi-related ? 
  i like to start all sexual requests with `` woman '' . 
  `` woman , put it in your mouth '', 
  works 60 % of the time ... well never actually . 
  what 's the point in asking if you 're going to cum soon 90 seconds after it happens ? 
  when i started playing the drums , my teacher was so impressed with my left hand co-ordination . 
  little did he know that i broke my right wrist a year earlier and the co-ordination is almost entirely due to left-handed fapping . 
  thanks , pal . 
  i did n't do so well in the first one but my so is incredibly supportive and i attribute not having to pretend i was sick for those exams to her . 
  could n't have possibly coped otherwise . 
  the fact that a subset of the population still ca n't get married is beyond absurd . 
  i do n't know how i 'll explain to my kids how it was ever this way . 
  that happens to every generation . 
  for every beatles there were thousands of forgettable but popular ( at the time ) bands . 
  could n't agree more on the alt medicine . 
  i find it sickening that people are allowed to profit ( from greediness or ignorance ) out of denying people proper medical treatment . 
  people complain a lot about big pharma ( sometimes for fair reasons ) but the level of evil is nothing compared to someone who can say with a straight face `` do n't take antibiotics , have this natural homeopathic remedy instead '' . 
  fuck you . 
  fuck you so much you evil fucking asshole you 're killing people . 
  i think we 'll be really ashamed of how we treated the mentally ill . 
  dying and having my life mean nothing to the world . 
  perhaps instead of saying religion ( since that 's a fairly huge statement ) how about we agree on the anti-intellectual and anti-science pockets of religion that pride themselves on their own ignorance ? 
  ask him ? 
  if he does n't want to , accept that and do n't pressure him . 
  it 's like a warm apple pie, 
  haha i knew it was a matter of minutes until i got posted on srs . 
  this is a true honour ( again ), 
  thanks for sharing that , it 's very kind . 
  i 'd be lying if i said that you did n't make me a little bit misty eyed at work . 
  your children are very lucky . 
  except that as a guy you have to err on the side of being gentle , especially the first time . 
  even if 99 % of girls prefer it rough , you have to be gentle until prompted otherwise for that 1 % . 
  obviously there are degrees but you know what i 'm saying . 
  it has to be `` vaccines cause autism '' or `` being cold causes you to catch a cold '', 
  ( consensual ) rough sex = / = rape, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/jenny_mccarthy_body_count/home.html ) . 
  there are few people who have had a bigger negative impact on this world than her . 
  this seems like a huuuge mistake . 
  can you really raise kids with someone that you have such different ideas about the world with ? 
  what if you had a gay child for that matter ? 
  to be fair , if there 's anyone who knows about the dangers of having things jabbed into you , it 's a pornstar, 
  stop it right now . 
  i did n't realise that doggie-style and anal were two different things until after i 'd started having sex . 
  welcome emily . 
  please feel free to leave your coat and life by the door . 
  there are bathrooms and refreshments to your left , there is no exit door . 
  you 're almost certainly not a psychopath or a sociopath but you 're clearly struggling right now . 
  please talk to a professional psychologist about this , there is help out there . 
  uncomfortably slow by newton faulkner . 
  no song better describes what my depression felt like . 
  i played it to my so to try and explain what it was like , she cried too . 
  so you do n't like ** him ** , you like ** parts ** of him . 
  no-one is perfect but this is a pretty big hurdle . 
  it 's probably more to do with sounding like an ass than being a new account . 
  you sure proved me wrong . 
  presumably panic . 
  [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/ ) is a link to ucla 's mindfulness research centre . 
  they have heaps of info and some guided meditations . 
  someone is grumpy today . 
  1 ) you 're a dick for saying that the other girl is wrong for her, 
  2 ) you clearly missed your chance and you need to back off , she 's with someone . 
  funnily enough , i realised when i was working in what i thought was my dream field . 
  i was so excited to get the job i had and i liked it , but i realised that i could n't do it for the rest of my life . 
  i realised that my true passion was psychology and my life has been 100x better since that realisation . 
  working at a football club . 
  yes but how/when you said it makes you a dick , irrespective of your view . 
  the fact that you like her means that you ca n't possibly be objective . 
  if you actually like her , do the right thing and stay out of it until she becomes single . 
  if this girl is truly bad for her , it will be soon enough . 
  there 's actually an itunes u course about it . 
  ca n't remember which university it is but it 's one of the top rated courses . 
  itunes u is pretty much the best thing ever . 
  i used to work at a movie theatre in the concession stand . 
  after each purchase i was supposed to say `` thanks and enjoy your movie '' . 
  it became so automatic that when i went to the cafeteria at school the next day , after receiving my food i said `` thanks and enjoy your movie '' to the cafeteria lady . 
  she was very confused .
