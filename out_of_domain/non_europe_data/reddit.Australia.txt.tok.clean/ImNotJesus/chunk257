  same thing happened to me , we just said that i got a bad blood nose . 
  my mum is kind enough to let me think that she believed me . 
  got up on stage at a music festival at a jam session where you sign up and they match you with other musicians and you play on stage for a crowd . 
  i decided to be brave and do it , despite not being used to playing with other people . 
  i freaked out so badly that i could n't keep time at all ( i was the drummer ) and the singer had to stop , turn around and start clicking the beat for me . 
  several friends were there watching . 
  inb4 air , food , water etc. 
  clean socks/undies . 
  you never notice them until you 're staring at an empty drawer and wondering what the hell you 're going to do . 
  that 's an awesome story but how was it embarrassing ? 
  tell your `` friend '' that she 's only doing him a disservice by staying with him if she is n't happy . 
  he 's going to hurt , he 's allowed to . 
  it 's not her responsibility to protect him from that and she 's only doing the opposite . 
  drinks are on me !, 
  pay a good chunk towards a house and probably a new car . 
  yes . 
  there 's no need to be harsh , some tact and timing is necessary but she 's not doing him a favour by being with him . 
  except that this guy seems to think that being punitive teaches someone a lesson . 
  if the kid managed to rack up $ 15k in debt without anyone noticing or teaching him otherwise , something went wrong, 
  being punitive never teaches the lesson that you want it to teach . 
  ** i 'm not saying that you should absolve him of his responsibility ** but if you make him pay back way more or ruin his credit or anything like that , you 're going to drastically change his life for the worse . 
  i guarantee you , he 's going to learn his lesson from this and there ** should ** be repercussions , just do n't fuck up his future because you 're angry right now . 
  seriously though , how did he get access to that much money ? 
  he should definitely be responsible for that debt , just not in a way that 's going to fuck up his future . 
  making your kid pay 20 % interest is pretty fucked up , irrespective of the situation . 
  he 's 18 . 
  how much is he going to earn ? 
  it will take years , even if paying every cent he earns . 
  it will drastically change how he lives his life . 
  would you go to college with a huge debt and 20 % interest hanging over your head ? 
  shit parents teach lessons through suffering , good parents teach lessons before then . 
  all kids are going to go through some suffering from time to time but this is clearly punitive . 
  he 's angry and that 's not how you want to deal with your kids , ever . 
  huh ? 
  when did i say otherwise ? 
  i did n't actually say what i 'd do but it would be this :, 
  1 ) make him sell the computers , any other big item he does n't ** need ** . 
  2 ) pay off the rest of the debt as a loan to him . 
  3 ) make him get a job, 
  4 ) impose certain restrictions while that loan is in place - no cc until it 's paid off , no new computers etc. 
  5 ) sit down with him and try to work out how the fuck it happened and talk to him like an adult who made a mistake , since that 's what he is , while also trying to see if i was personally responsible for any part of it ( giving him access to too much credit when he was n't ready etc. ), 
  i should 've made that explicit but i assumed it was implied in making him pay it off . 
  edit to that effect . 
  you still have n't answered why he had that much credit . 
  ummm so you want him to stay at school but accrue debt to you at 20 % interest ? 
  solid plan . 
  here 's what i would do, 
  1 ) make him sell the computers , any other big item he does n't need . 
  2 ) pay off the rest of the debt as a loan to him . 
  3 ) make him get a job, 
  4 ) impose certain restrictions while that loan is in place - no cc until it 's paid off , no new computers etc. 
  5 ) sit down with him and try to work out how the fuck it happened and talk to him like an adult who made a mistake , since that 's what he is , while also trying to see if i was personally responsible for any part of it ( giving him access to too much credit when he was n't ready etc. ), 
  you ca n't spell pyrrhic victory without victory . 
  1 ) the flu is more common in the winter . 
  2 ) temporal correlation = / = causation, 
  3 ) it 's probably a product of confirmation bias ( you expect it so you notice the pattern ) . 
  how often do you go out in the cold and ** not ** get sick ? 
  how often do you go out when it 's warm and get sick ? 
  how long after going out in the cold do you count it as being caused by being out there ? 
  when you 're a bit older , you 'll realise how much better the companionship is than the sex . 
  sure , sex is nice but it 's nothing compared to the love and support i get/give with my partner . 
  i would n't trade that companionship for any amount of sex . 
  edit : if all you want is sex right now , that 's okay , you should enjoy that ( as long as you 're being responsible and respectful ) . 
  i do n't want you to think that i 'm being condescending or superior , i think it 's fine to want that . 
  in fact , i respect that you know that about yourself and choose not to be in a relationship as a result . 
  when you 're ready . 
  it 's a very different experience and in some ways i wish i 'd spent more time just having fun before being in such a serious relationship . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm certain i want to be with my partner but there is certainly enjoyment to be had in both stages . 
  it sounds like you 're going through a bit of a rough patch . 
  have you considered talking to a therapist about these issues ? 
  i 'm sure the drinking and getting angry is n't working , perhaps a more productive strategy could help you work through this . 
  there are no magic words . 
  if there were , everyone would use them and they 'd cease to be meaningful . 
  what your mum wants and needs right now is support and love . 
  tell her you love her and just do your best to listen to her ( if she wants to talk - do n't pressure her to do so ) . 
  be there for her and she 'll work through this in her own time . 
  ( it 's a joke ) but i 'm with you . 
  everyone who has ever been in a relationship is with you , whether they realise it or not . 
  that level comes with the high horse mount does n't it ? 
  it sounds like you 've got a lot of questions that would be best worked through with a psych ** ologist ** . 
  i do n't mean to suggest that you 're `` sick '' or `` need fixing '' but if these fears/concerns are affecting your ability to have happy and meaningful relationships , it sounds like talking them through with a professional would be a good idea . 
  i 'm at work , ca n't watch :( . 
  enjoy it for the both of us , okay ? 
  i do n't really understand your question . 
  do you mind rephrasing it ? 
  i 'll be happy to explain it to you . 
  i have no idea what you were trying to say there . 
  it could be because my brain is fried right now though . 
  do you mind asking me what your experience was with the psychologist and why you stopped ? 
  it can take a bit of time to make progress sometimes . 
  best of luck fighting the good fight , pal . 
  i 'm so confused right now . 
  were you trying to say that the grammar in my initial response was poor ? 
  protip : maslow 's hierarchy of needs has nothing to do with relationships . 
  there are heaps of theories about relationships . 
  start with sternberg and work your way through . 
  right . 
  we 're on the same page now . 
  can i count a tv show ? 
  i saw the start of an episode of x-files when i was way too young and it gave me nightmares for months .
