  all i saw was an empty bed fly across a room and slam into a door . 
  the fact that i can remember it so clearly from more than 15 years ago tells you how much it scarred me . 
  let me start by saying fuck that therapist . 
  she does n't deserve her license . 
  if you really ca n't afford the time for therapy right now , do you mind me offering some stop-gap solutions ? 
  firstly , you can buy books that teach you how to use cognitive behavioural therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy on yourself . 
  they 're not as good as having a professional do it for you , but it certainly can help . 
  second , have you ever meditated ? 
  in the last 10 years there have been a tonne of studies showing how good it is in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms . 
  in fact , you can physically change your brain in a few weeks with regular practise . 
  [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/ ) is a link to ucla 's mindfulness research centre where they talk about the research but more importantly give you some great guided meditations to get started . 
  5 minutes a day and you could see a difference ( longer is better but do n't pressure yourself to do too much ) . 
  lastly , make sure you 're getting at least * some * exercise . 
  it 's not just good for your physical health , it has incredible effects on your mental health . 
  ** please ** , let me know if you 're keen to try any/all of these and message me if you need support ( if you feel like you 're struggling to meditate or whatever it is ) . 
  i 'll be happy to help . 
  right , but what you 're saying is simply not accurate . 
  there are heaps of good theories about the nature of intimacy/compassion/attraction in relationships . 
  maslow is unrelated . 
  the best kind of review !, 
  wow, 
  i 've read [ this ] ( http://www.thehappinesstrap.com/ ) and it 's pretty good . 
  i have n't tried any cbt books but i know from others that they 're not bad . 
  i 'd look for one written/reviewed by real psychologists and/or researchers . 
  as for meditating , the popular type in the research at the moment is mindfulness . 
  mindfulness is basically the practise of focussing your attention on a single point . 
  you can do it through sound , sensation or most commonly the breath . 
  the idea is that you pick a focal point , let 's say the breath and attempt to maintain your focus . 
  each breath you experience the feeling of it going in and out , noticing whatever it feels like . 
  ** you will start to think and lose your focus ** it is completely normal . 
  all you need to do is gently redirect yourself back to where you want your attention to be . 
  the biggest mistake that new people make is thinking that you 're supposed to be `` good '' at it . 
  if you were `` good '' at it , there 'd be no point doing it . 
  the benefit you get is training yourself to have a singular focus and not be ruled by constant noise your brain produces . 
  if you 're keen , i 'd start with the 19 minute meditation on that website . 
  it 's long but it gives you a taste of different types of meditation . 
  the other sort of meditation that i like is [ yoga nidra ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/deep-relaxation-guided-meditation/id434139276#ls=1 ) . 
  yoga nidra is a little bit different and it 's all about visualisation . 
  try both and see which your prefer . 
  the most improtant thing is making it something you do regularly and enjoy . 
  if it 's a chore , you wo n't maintain it . 
  how is it taking part if i make fun of him ? 
  also , in case you have n't noticed , i do n't take myself very seriously , i 'm more than happy to have a joke with someone i do n't agree with . 
  no harm done . 
  have a good night , 
  / r/asksocialscience is getting bigger but it 's awesome . 
  i also love / r/askculinary, 
  i 'm scared right now . 
  depression is a medical issue and should be treated as such . 
  please go talk to a psych ** ologist ** . 
  say that to him . 
  do n't beat around the bush . 
  if he 's not okay with that , that 's sad but that 's just the situation . 
  bo burnham - words, 
  if you 're not being helped , find a new therapist then . 
  when i was going through my depression , my mother ( who was supporting me at the time ) decided it had been too long without a job and was n't going to pay for my therapy unless i had one . 
  i was n't able to work , just not ready . 
  i was incredibly lucky that my therapist agreed to let me accrue debt and he only charged me what it cost him to rent the room . 
  if he did n't do me that kindness , i have no idea what i would 've done . 
  to steal the phrase ; it gets better . 
  you do n't get to choose your family right now but you will get to choose who you spend the rest of your life with . 
  you deserve to and will find someone who completely appreciates you and loves you just the way you are . 
  i 'm so sorry for your situation . 
  if it helps , i 've had a similar but lesser experience so i do understand some of your pain :, 
  a while ago , i realised that my mother became pregnant with me only a few weeks after my sister died . 
  she said that she wanted me but i know that there 's no way that anyone going through that sort of grief can make that decision . 
  the realisation fucked me up for quite a while and i could n't help but let it change my self-worth . 
  ** but ** , it got better for me and it will for you too . 
  i live with my so now and my life is better than ever . 
  in the horribly mangled words of dan savage :, 
  it 's the guy 's responsibility to be discrete about his porn use . 
  it 's the girl 's responsibility to pretend she does n't know . 
  also , they may watch it together . 
  do you want to open that pandora 's box ? 
  how do you know she does n't ? 
  you did n't know he did . 
  at work , i ca n't look at tumblr :(, 
  i do n't think i do but i loved the description !, 
  no problems at all . 
  if you want/need to talk in pm please feel free to message me . 
  i 'm at work for the next 80 minutes or so and am doing nothing but i 'll also reply another time if you do n't want to right now . 
  also , protip : it only goes into your inbox if it 's a direct reply to your post . 
  because i technically responded to heyktgirl , it would 've been in her/his inbox not yours . 
  yes and going back to a therapist who did n't help you would be silly . 
  therapy works . 
  it 's worked for me and it works in every study on depression/anxiety it has been used in . 
  short term solutions :, 
  1 ) regular exercise, 
  2 ) learn to meditate , click [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/ ), 
  3 ) regular sleeping patterns . 
  these can reduce anxious/depressive symptoms but wo n't fix it . 
  / r/shitredditsays and / r/mensrights, 
  sit back and watch the fireworks . 
  by not breaking up with him , you 're tacitly accepting that you do n't deserve better . 
  do you think that 's true about yourself ? 
  if no , break the fuck up with him . 
  if yes , slap yourself and break the fuck up with him . 
  you deserve to be happy ** but ** you need a bit of bravery to make that happen . 
  it will hurt . 
  no matter what you do , it 's going to hurt , but that 's not a reason to avoid this step .
