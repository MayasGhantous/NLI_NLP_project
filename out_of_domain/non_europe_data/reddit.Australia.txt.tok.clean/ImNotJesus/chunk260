  have been for a couple of months now . 
  how do you know what the experience of being bits and bytes is ? 
  you 're just electricity and chemicals , or so you think anyway . 
  if you were a simulation , it would make sense to not feel like you were in a simulation . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  it takes a pretty extreme sadness to produce suicide . 
  if you 've ever seriously contemplated suicide or know someone who has , you know that this is n't a decision that people come to easily . 
  it 's not something where people write a list of pros and cons to living and say `` hmm there 's one more con than pro , might as well end it '' . 
  wanting to live is our ** most basic drive ** . 
  if you 've felt your body rush with adrenalin when you 're scared , you know how desperate your body is to do anything it can to survive . 
  i highly , highly doubt someone would be able to kill themselves out of sheer intellectual curiosity and if they could , if they can completely disregard that need to live , that 's a sign of pretty severe mental illness in itself . 
  cry a lot, 
  my hobbies are gaming and spending time online so clearly i do n't leave the house because i have no friends or romantic prospects . 
  my other hobby is cooking . 
  i think the stereotypes are changing for that so i 'm not really sure . 
  in the past , i think a guy would 've been considered gay for saying he loves cooking . 
  anyone want to tell me what your stereotypes are about 25 year old guys who love cooking ? 
  edit : i 'm also a student so i must live off of my parents ' money and smoke weed all day , cramming the day before exams . 
  as an australian who has only ever seen guns in a policeman 's holster ( and that was even a bit jarring the first time i saw it ) , what 's your reason for liking guns ? 
  is it the power ? 
  is it self-defence ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious because my instincts are to be very much anti-gun ownership ( which i recognise is an instinctual and not intellectual problem - i think ) so i 'd love to be proven wrong if i am . 
  there 's some joke there about a furry shitting in the woods but i ca n't quite make it work . 
  instead i 'll just congratulate you for having the balls to enjoy what you like . 
  those furry , furry balls . 
  you can , with [ this ] ( http://www.google.com ) website . 
  you 're also a wanker who ca n't enjoy any other music, 
  do n't forget the tiny penis . 
  so it 's almost entirely for self-defence ? 
  do you think that how high the rates of gun ownership are in america lead to more people needing guns which causes more people to need guns etc. 
  and leaves everyone worse off for it ? 
  again , this is a genuine question , please do n't think i 'm attacking you i 'm just trying to understand the mentality there because as someone who lives in a country with almost no guns , this seems bizarre . 
  that 's a weird one because the stereotypes are so wildly different in different situations . 
  your stereotype on reddit would be wildly different to in a small rural town . 
  you can ? 
  thanks because i 've been getting this `` out of paper '' error and i ca n't work out how to fix it . 
  this really is n't a question , it 's just a way for you to give everyone your opinion . 
  try / r/rant or / r/self, 
  right but what i 'm suggesting is that everyone feeling like they have the right/need to own guns and the fact that there are so many available , lead to ** more ** gun crime which leads to more needs for guns etc. 
  i mean , i look at something like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ) and wonder if there 's something fundamentally different about america to other western countries that the rates of firearm death are so much higher ( i ca n't think of any good reason it would be ** so much ** higher ) or whether it comes down to more guns being around . 
  if there 's another reason , i 'd love to know but i just ca n't help but think that everyone having guns is a net loss , not a net gain . 
  again , please correct me if i 'm wrong , if i am i 'll gladly change my opinion . 
   do everything horsey that i 'd like to do, 
  the internet has ruined me, 
  exactly but anyone who knows about martial arts knows that a tkd blackbelt is fairly meaningless !, 
  so why is there so much less violent crime in australia where so many fewer people have guns ? 
  is there a fundamental difference between the countries ? 
  we 're pretty similar . 
  give an alternate reason beyond more guns . 
  fair enough . 
  i go through phases where i get heaps/no karma . 
  in the 3 months i 've got about 100k comment , almost entirely in askreddit but got very little for months before that . 
  i broke the top 20 in comment karma the other day , that was kinda cool . 
  you 'll get there in a few months at this pace probably . 
  i like 80 % of what the greens stand for , the other 20 % they go full retard . 
  i think we 're going to see record votes for greens/asp/independents in the next election . 
  everyone is sick of labour 's bullshit but no-one thinks abbott can do much better . 
  who said we 're having a debate ? 
  i 'm trying to learn more about something by seeing it from someone else 's perspective . 
  in return i 'm giving my point of view and asking them to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  in fact , i 've stated ** several times ** that i 'll gladly change my position . 
  how , in any way , is that a debate ? 
  then why are the rates of homicide [ 4 times higher in america than australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) ? 
  if guns are a deterrent , would n't homicide be ** much ** lower ? 
  you 've never been happy about a tetris high score ? 
  those points are just as imaginary . 
  the only difference is that here i 'm getting joy out of people thinking i 'm funny/interesting/informative instead of playing a game by myself . 
  i appreciate that , i upvoted your reply for what it 's worth , i always upvote people who cause discussion , even if i disagree . 
  i was n't trying to say that all violence is caused by gun ownership . 
  i was saying that my instinctual fear of the high prevalence of gun ownership would create a more dangerous environment that begets more gun ownership . 
  i was n't asserting knowledge of a causal link , i was explaining my position and asking people to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  weird , i do n't remember saying that . 
  i 'm asking for opinions and giving mine . 
  do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i am keen to try it , at least at a range where i can shoot at some targets . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not attacking you , i 'm just trying to learn from other people 's perspectives . 
  i like asking questions of people that believe differently to me , that 's how you learn . 
  i was n't trying to say that all violence is caused by gun ownership .

  thanks , that 's a really good answer . 
  i 'm getting 50 % well-thought out good answers , 50 % attacks . 
  it 's per 100,000 . 
  it scales . 
  i get that . 
  i think you 're looking at it from a micro scale and i 'm looking at it from a macro scale . 
  if you 're thinking about that guy that may walk into your house one day , i totally understand why you 'd look at it from the micro scale . 
  i live in a really safe area , if i did n't maybe my perception would change . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#2010s ), 
  this is n't a genuine question , it 's just a chance for you to give others your opinion/ask for support . 
  try / r/self , / r/rant , / r/politics , / r/technology or plenty of others . 
  i agree and have a couple in my family . 
  funnily enough , one was an incredibly talented jazz pianist and then decided that he had more fun writing trance . 
  it 's certainly not a `` normal '' path for a jazz musician . 
  yeah , i think the broken up nature of the discussion ( where i 'm also getting attacked at the same time by others ) probably makes it seem less like a genuine conversation and more like point scoring . 
  have n't ever used fireworks , could be fun . 
  i do want to go to a gun range and try it at some stage too . 
  that depends what i 'm famous for . 
  would i like to be a celebrity ?
