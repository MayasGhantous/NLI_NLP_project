  would i like to be famous because i 've written some popular psychology books ? 
  fair enough . 
  i appreciate your responses , 
  thanks , i 'll have a look, 
  yes that one extreme outlier sure proves me wrong . 
  fair call, 
  that is a fair point . 
  we do get incest leaking through the border from tasmania though and some sheep fucking from new zealand . 
  protip : when adding a link , it needs the http : / /, 
  i tried to turn water into wine , it only became grape juice . 
  i need to make one important point first . 
  ** there 's a very big difference between your personal preference and what you think the law should be ** . 
  my partner could never have an abortion but she would also never deny any other woman that right . 
  with that out of the way , i 'd like to give you the biggest reason that i 'm pro-choice : my first priority is the lives of the babies that make it to term . 
  no baby chooses to be born . 
  every single one that * is * born deserves to have parents that love , want and have the means to take care of it . 
  forcing women to have children when they 're not capable of giving adequate care is n't fair to that child . 
  it 's just not . 
  if you want to talk about protecting children , why the hell would you ever pressure a woman to have a baby she 's ** telling you that she ca n't take care of ** or force her to give it up for adoption ? 
  abortion is never a good option . 
  no-one has ever said `` yay , i 'm going to have an abortion this week !! '', 
  being pro-choice does n't mean that you want abortions to happen , it just means that you realise that sometimes not having the abortion is worse . 
  edit tl ; dr : babies deserve the right to be born into a family that love , want and have the means to take care of them . 
  step 1 : find a therapist and talk this through , ** thoroughly ** . 
  if you still feel like you want to do it after you 've looked at it from every angle , then you need to bite the bullet and do it . 
  you 're not doing her a favour staying with her if you 're not happy . 
  that means you 're pro-choice . 
  you want women to have the right to make their own decision , even if you feel uneasy about that decision . 
  that , regardless of what you intuitively believe , the world consistently becomes a much more wonderful place to live in over time . 
  by all objective measures , we live in the best world that has ever existed ( health , violence , opportunity , science , equality etc. ), 
  given a long enough time-span , humans will innovate themselves out of whatever you 're concerned about right now . 
  my computer you idiot . 
  i have the most wonderful , loving girlfriend . 
  i 'm still certain that i 'm unloveable . 
  deep down , i ca n't ever believe her that she loves me and i 'll always try to sabotage the relationship with my insecurities . 
  do you mean while alive or after dying ? 
  jew nose 5, 
  in the words of fat bastard :, 
   i ca n't stop eating . 
  i eat because i 'm unhappy , and i 'm unhappy because i eat . 
  fair call . 
  last federal i voted for the secular party . 
  shortly after i went to one of their meetings , realised they were legitimately crazy ( some of them anyway , others were wonderful ) so i ca n't do that again . 
  why does being a dude matter ? 
  everyone wants to feel loved , everyone wants to connect to another person and everyone fears that they wo n't ( to some extent - it 's different for everyone ) . 
  i 'm actually at work right now . 
  i do n't think people really understand what it 's like to fight food your whole life . 
  let 's say that you 're an alcoholic . 
  your life spun out of control and you got to a point that you wanted to stop . 
  you quit . 
  stop drinking . 
  it 's hard but you 're committed and you really want to . 
  imagine now that 3 times a day you have to drink ** a little ** bit of alcohol . 
  just a few sips . 
  not just that , but you have to drink alcohol you do n't like as much because you know that your favourite is worse for you . 
  every day , throughout your recovery , you have to ** make a choice ** to only have a few sips of that alcohol you do n't particularly like . 
  does n't sound like such an easy choice now does it ? 
  i 'm a food addict . 
  i 'm emotionally affected by the food i eat . 
  if i 'm standing at the supermarket deciding between two options , i 'm angry at myself if i choose the bad option and i 'm horribly sad if i do n't . 
  i have a ** drive ** to eat the foods that are bad for me . 
  i lost 100lbs fighting myself ** every single fucking meal ** . 
  i ca n't describe how emotionally tiring that gets . 
  you 're still pro-choice because you want women to have the right to choose . 
  you can find something morally difficult but still be * for * people having the right to choose , like voting republican amirite ? 
  seriously though , being pro-choice does n't mean pro-abortion . 
  no-one is pro-abortion . 
  being pro-choice just means that , whether or not you 'd do it yourself , you think people should have the right to choose . 
  you know , it 's funny , a few nights ago i was in the supermarket and had been having a few shit days . 
  i did my usual walk back and forth getting angry at myself trying to decide whether to get ice-cream or not . 
  i was listening to a podcast at the time . 
  it was louis c.k. 
  on wtf . 
  louis was talking about seeing a therapist and it not being for him so he just said to the therapist , please just give me some advice to stop fucking up my own life . 
  the therapist said to him `` you know those times that you do stupid shit , you 're just anxious . 
  take a breath . '', 
  literally as he said those words i looked at the tub of ice-cream that i 'd seconds ago picked up . 
  took a breath , and put it back . 
  louis c.k. 
  rescued my night . 
  well , the people there were really split . 
  the younger people were all pretty engaged and interesting and had good ideas . 
  some of the older people ... 
  i guess i would n't totally trust their motivations or sanity . 
  one lady seemed like most of her desire for secularism was out of hatred of muslims . 
  the worst was probably the guy ( head of the meeting too ) who said that `` like , we would n't * want * it to happen but if another september 11 happened it would probably be pretty good for our cause '' just in casual conversation .

  not giving a fuck and genuine self-confidence are n't actually the same thing . 
  not giving a fuck is bravado , it 's putting up a front of who you think you should be , it 's the exact opposite of genuine self-confidence . 
  genuine self-confidence is admitting to yourself that you feel insecure but choosing to act the way you want to act anyway . 
  there 's no bravery in saying you do n't care . 
  there 's bravery in saying that you care but you choose to do it anyway . 
  if you do n't like driving , you have n't discovered the wonderful world of podcasts . 
  this would only encourage terrible novelty accounts like arrowtotheknee, 
  that 's very sweet of you to say .
