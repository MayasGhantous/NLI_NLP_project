  any novelty account that replies the same thing every comment ( or the comment is n't dependant on what it 's replying to ) is fucking terrible in my books . 
  edit : yay we won .

  how * you * doing, 
  * runs away scared *, 
  i 've talked to girls before . 
  my mum is a girl . 
  my sister is a girl . 
  my boss is a girl . 
  sometimes i put a wig on my right hand and pretend it 's a girl . 
  does that count ? 
  you 're now tagged as `` possibly a girl '', 
  excuse , i need to find a tiny wig . 
  i do n't care if this is real . 
  i loved that story . 
  how creepy this is is 90 % dependant on whether you first found her on / r/gonewild, 
  i use this username and nothing else because i 'm terrified of anyone knowing what i post on here . 
  one friend knows my reddit username and he had to message me the other day because he felt bad about reading something super personal on here . 
  i used to work with a guy whose surname was badcock . 
  needless to say , you ca n't * not * try to find out . 
  psychology, 
  i 'm not sure but just make sure to delete all of his porn before anyone else looks at it . 
  we 'd all want it done if a friend was going through our computer posthumously . 
  i 've got a set of 3 shuns that my so gave me for christmas . 
  it 's like slicing with satin . 
  i had someone at school tell me that he wished hitler finished the job . 
  it was probably the most important day of my life so far . 
  it was the day i decided what kind of man i wanted to be after having to put my needs aside to take care of my sister . 
  that was also the first day i would say that i no longer suffered from depression . 
  / r/toomuchtimeonmyhands, 
  actually , that 's most of reddit really, 
  telling someone their fly is n't done up . 
  ca n't watch now , i 'm at work . 
  i 'm very spoilt with those knives , i love them !, 
  what 's the video ? 
  thanks pal,

  louis armstrong - what a wonderful world, 
  actually , that 's a good idea . 
  i 'm going to listen right now . 
  i would n't know , i have n't left the basement in months . 
  no psychology theory tries to explain all of human behaviour , it would be ludicrous to try . 
  it 's about tendencies and biases , not `` this is who you are '' . 
  there 's a theory in ** ferris buelller 's day off ** that cameron invented ferris and he 's living out what cameron wishes he could be . 
  makes the movie fucking mind blowing . 
  which is great except that it makes absolutely no sense . 
  fight club was very deliberately constructed to make it possible in hindsight . 
  himym is n't . 
  try to find groups/clubs/hobbies where you can meet people with similar interests . 
  it 's much easier to become friends if you 've got that anchor that you can always talk about when all else fails . 
  i think that it would certainly fuck me up , but i ( hope ) would n't hesitate to kill someone who threatened me or my family . 
  that 's what i figured , it blew my mind when i realised it after reading the books as a kid . 
  my gf thinks that her jokes are funny,

  please talk to a mental health professional, 
  it goes from mind blowing to fucking mind blowing . 
  subtle but important difference . 
  it was so good that it deserves 3 l 's . 
  if cameron is craving ferris ' importance , perhaps he imagined the principal chasing him too ? 
  maybe he was actually chasing cameron since he missed school as well ? 
  he decided not to kill himself . 
  facebook links are banned , they can be traced back to you . 
  guy gets into fights , decides he likes it , tries to get into more fights, 
  video was found not guilty of radio star murder . 
  because you 're a judgemental dick who likes to feel superior to people as a way of supplementing your ego . 
  because each upvote convinces me , for just a moment , that i 'm loved . 
  also , i just have a lot of spare time and it 's fun . 
  i 'd like to connect to you , anonymous_anus . 
  i go crazy for a bit of anonymous_anus love, 
  you should get the magical attractive haircut . 
  you know , the one that suits all men and all women find attractive . 
  that they 're a way for idiots to confirm their already held beliefs and/or scare their idiot friends . 
  i never said you were . 
  report it to management and get really fucking angry at your work for giving out your number, 
  well , let this be a lesson then . 
  if you 're not clear with what you want , people get the wrong idea . 
  i 'm not trying to be harsh or victim blame , i 'm just saying that you can learn from this . 
  it 's not appropriate for askreddit but you 're welcome to set up a subreddit to do it . 
  finding parking, 
  that 's okay buddy , i was n't telling you off , just trying to let you know how you can get it off the ground if you are keen to . 
  if you post about it on this subreddit it will be removed . 
  keep it up and make an edit with a link to the subreddit , you 'll get a little bit of free advertising that way ,

  talk to the faculty or a lawyer . 
  call the cops, 
  is there an exception to the rule that there 's an exception to every rule ? 
  also successful in destroying his dignity, 
  to be fair , if her aim was revenge , she won . 
  like , she destroyed you . 
  we set ourselves apart from every out-group in ever growing circles . 
  you and your friends think your way better than people who are n't your friends . 
  you and other supporters of your football team think you 're better than supporters of other football teams . 
  you and other people in your religion ( or lack thereof ) think you 're better than people in other religions . 
  studies show that all you need to do is tell people that they 're arbitrarily assigned to a team and they 'll start acting with in-group bias . 
  even if you ** tell ** them it was arbitrary , they 'll start thinking their group is better than others . 
  we 're wired that way . 
  are you * sure * ?
