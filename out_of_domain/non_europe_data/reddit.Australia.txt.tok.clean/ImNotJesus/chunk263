  psychologist . 
  i drove for a year with an expired license and was nervous every single time i drove . 
  it took 20 minutes to update it . 
  oh man , i did n't even need to do that , just needed a new picture . 
  thanks , 
  more importantly , are you in a financial and emotional situation where you can give your child adequate care ? 
  meditation has been shown in study after study to be brilliant for this .

  a few minutes a day and you 'll actually physically change your brain for the better .

  also , exercise works wonders . 
  small - i fall asleep at about 10 oclock every night . 
  do n't expect lots of big nights out, 
  medium - i fart a lot . 
  if we 're going to be together long term , you need to get used to that, 
  large - i 'll always question whether you love me and get distant when i doubt it, 
  the first rule is that i ca n't talk about it, 
  i did n't say it was * smart *, 
  just in case anyone is wondering , the overwhelming scientific consensus is that hitting children as a punishment , is n't just a terrible strategy to change behaviour , it also has a myriad of other negative outcomes . 
  [ here is a link to the biggest meta-analysis on the topic that looks at over 80 studies ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doilanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.539 ), 
  tl ; dr hitting your kids is an objectively bad parenting strategy, 
  edit : to be clear , as i 've said over and over in this thread , i 'm not talking about anyone 's personal experience , i 'm saying that the science suggests that ** overall ** it 's a bad strategy to create behaviour change . 
  i 'm not telling you how to parent . 
  i 'm not saying that your parents were bad parents or that you must have turned out horrible . 
  edit 2 : [ full paper ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ), 
  edit 3 : i 've had maybe 15 people message me already to say that they were hit as a kid and `` deserved it '' . 
  it 's breaking my heart . 
  ** kids are wired to trust their parents ** . 
  it 's evolutionarily adaptive and a very good strategy for a child in general . 
  if you 're a kid getting hit by your parents , you have two choices . 
  you can believe that they 're evil monsters who want to hurt you or you can believe that you 're bad/broken/wrong . 
  you can explain it to them as much you want but when you hit a kid , it 's an extreme situation . 
  they do n't have the cognitive capacity to say `` well , i can see that this was a really extreme situation that i should avoid again in the future and the only reason they 'd hit me was for my own protection . 
  i 'll stop doing this one behaviour '' . 
  i 'm not trying to say that if you hit your kid once they 'll instantly become mentally ill or something ridiculous like that , i 'm just saying that it has ** a lot ** more effect than other forms of punishment . 
  and with all due respect , there 's a reason that science does n't rely on individual subjective opinions . 
  you may have not been at all emotionally affected by being hit . 
  you may also have been affected in ways you do n't know . 
  either way , the science is the same . 
  i 'm not trying to be a cock , i just get this response really consistently when i talk about this research and it 's not a response i 'd get if i was talking about ~ ~ physics ~ ~ medicine . 
  edit : i accidentally a word and a better analogy, 
  here 's the problem with spanking . 
  firstly , children model how they deal with situations on their parents . 
  one of the big findings in that study is that spanking increases children 's aggression because they learn that violence * can * solve problems . 
  if you teach kids ways to deal with upset/disagreement etc. 
  they learn other coping mechanisms . 
  secondly , the most important role a parent plays in their kid 's life is helping them feel safe . 
  when a child feels safe ( physically ** and ** emotionally ) they explore , they experiment , they learn through experience . 
  when a child does n't feel safe , when they do n't feel like they have unconditional positive regard ( trust that no matter what they do , they 'll always be loved the same amount ) they do n't feel safe to do that . 
  violence is jarring , especially from someone with power over you . 
  you feel dominated . 
  it does n't lead to growth , it leads to fear and immediate compliance but not long-term behaviour change . 
  edit : formatting, 
  and you 're welcome to believe what you want . 
  you 're clearly devoted to that position and i can certainly understand why you would n't want to believe that your parents let you down in that way . 
  however , it does n't change that ** overall ** , the science says that it 's a bad strategy . 
  you 're welcome to believe that if you 'd like . 
  psychology is studied as a science . 
  double-blind experiments with research controls and proper statistical analyses are conducted . 
  those papers are published in real journals with peer-review . 
  if you have some reason for not thinking it 's science , that 's your view , it just is n't true . 
  edit : grammar, 
  that 's your prerogative . 
  i have no intention to tell you how to parent , all i 'm doing is telling you the science . 
  you commend yourself for that as an adult ? 
   despite, 
  well , i 'm not sure what you base that first claim on but if you have any evidence for it , i 'd be more than happy to read it . 
  most meta-analyses will tell you what methods they used for data collection so you can go back and verify if they did n't put things in . 
  i can certainly see how there would be * some * selection bias , whether conscious or not , but that 's a part of any research . 
  do n't forget , it still goes through peer-review . 
  [ ask and ye shall receive ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ), 
   scientists are human however - and no-one wants the career-hurting results that `` hitting kids works '' . 
  really , who would ever publish a study like that ? 
  who would be comfortable putting those results out ? 
  actually , some studies have been presented that have said that it 's `` not too bad '' . 
  the vast majority argue the opposite . 
  remember that more controversial papers are * more * likely to get published . 
  the issue is actually the opposite . 
  we need journals publishing more middle of the road research . 
   i 've no idea the truth , but neither do i trust the world to research/publish on such controversial topics . 
  i never said that you should take this as unchallenged gospel . 
  all i 'm saying is that it means * more * than one person 's incredibly biased subjective opinion of their own upbringing . 
  i 've made a lot of comments in this thread and not once have i told anyone how to act or what to believe , i 'm just presenting the science . 
  it 's not * a * study , it 's a meta-analysis of over 80 . 
  as i 've said to others , i 'm not telling you what to believe , just giving you the science . 
  just remember that you 're subject to more bias than objective science is . 
  as i said before , you could be an outlier , you could just be wrong about how it impacted you , i make no claims about your individual experience . 
  i 'm saying that the science shows it to be a bad strategy ** overall ** . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't remember the post where i said that this finding is true for everyone all the time and in every situation . 
  oh , that 's right , i did n't , because that would be absurd . 
  if you have a psychology degree you know as well as i do that psychology findings talk about trends and averages . 
  no study would every say that every time you hit a kid you ruin their future , that 's absurd . 
  as i 've said over and over in this thread , i 'm not talking about anyone 's personal experience , i 'm saying that the science suggests that ** overall ** it 's a bad strategy to create behaviour change . 
  sorry but you 're just wrong on that last point . 
  i 'm not trying to be a cock but history says otherwise . 
  of course . 
  i guess the better analogy is medicine . 
  penicillin does n't work the same for everyone in all contexts but that does n't mean that it does n't work .
