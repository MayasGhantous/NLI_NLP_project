  fair call and perhaps physics was a bad analogy . 
  i think a better analogy would be medicine . 
  penicillin does n't work for all people the same way all the time but that does n't mean that it does n't work . 
   they love their parents almost no matter what . 
  exactly why hitting them is especially torturous . 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  you 're forced to love your abuser . 
  changed my analogy . 
   social science has never discovered a numerical constant in any observed relationship . 
  there are no quantitative laws of social science . 
  all models need to keep tweaking their coefficients , and sometimes even the variables , to stay relevant in a shifting social world . 
  this is n't just about complexity , but dynamic human variation . 
  i ** completely ** agree and anyone who says that a social science study proves an absolute truth of the world deserves to be scolded . 
  i 'm responding to those saying it 's `` not a science '' , not those who say that all research needs to be kept in context . 
  that sort of stuff can be controlled for in studies but yes , of course you 're right . 
  you can study an atom in some level of isolation , you ca n't do the same with a trait . 
  no-one is saying you can and i will immediately retract anything i said that gave even * implied * that psychology can tell you undeniable rules about the universe . 
  that 's not the purpose of psychology . 
  you 're welcome to believe that if you like . 
  i 'm just presenting the science , not telling anyone what to believe . 
  you 're welcome to believe that if you like . 
  i 'm just presenting the science , not telling anyone what to believe . 
  it makes me really sad to think that there are parents who believe that . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  they 're not wired to love and seek protection from inanimate objects like they are with their parents , it 's completely different . 
  i understand your perspective , i just simply do n't share it . 
  i think there 's always a better alternative and if your children do n't listen to your words at all , you 've got bigger problems . 
  you 're welcome to believe that it 's condescending ... 
  i 'm kidding . 
  i really do n't mean to condescend , i 'm just trying to make it clear that i 'm not telling anyone what to think or believe . 
  i 'm not going to get into an argument with anyone and tell them how to parent or that their parents were assholes . 
  that 's not the point of science and it 's not my position . 
  here 's the problem with that , you have no possible way of knowing how you/your friends would have turned out if your parents had a different strategy . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're a shit person and you would 've been amazing otherwise because that would be absurd . 
  all i 'm saying is that the science suggests that overall , it does n't provide as much behaviour change as people seem to believe and there * are * negative outcomes that result . 
  i ca n't easily link you to any studies on that but i think it 's much the same . 
  kids need to always feel that they 're safe and loved no matter what they * do * . 
  actually , i do have a good [ link ] ( http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/ ), 
  just an fyi , you 'll struggle to find a meta-analysis bigger than 80 studies . 
  that means 80 individual published experiments , not 80 participants . 
   but spanking can be quite effective, 
  the science says otherwise . 
  however , you 're welcome to believe what you like . 
  yes , when it 's a question of opinion , not a question of science . 
  i 'm not going to change my chance on spanking because i think the science is clear and i value that over my own subjective experience . 
  hey pal , how 's it going ? 
  they 're over about 40 years haha . 
  it 's by far the most comprehensive meta-analysis i 've ever seen . 
  thanks for sharing, 
  i certainly think they 're wrong but it 's not my place to tell them how to parent or see theirs . 
  that 's why i 'm trying to be clear when i 'm talking about science and when it 's my opinion . 
  you can do that without physically/verbally abusing them . 
  if you ca n't , you have bigger problems . 
   and you can believe what some random meta-analysis says . 
  and i will . 
  i take more stock in incredibly well researched science than your subjective biassed opinion of your own upbringing . 
  i never said that this is a universal rule of the universe and applies in all times and all situations . 
  i 'm saying that the science says that ** overall ** it 's a bad strategy and i stand by that . 
   i just think that children are best parented through careful attention and love, 
  i heartily agree and i think that spanking flies in the face of it . 
  cool study , thanks for the link . 
  i 'll give it a complete read later today . 
  a couple of important notes though :, 
  1 ) this is looking at one outcome of spanking , whereas the link i gave looked at 13 . 
  2 ) in this case it was an effective but not the ** most ** effective strategy, 
  3 ) it did n't look out the long-term negative outcomes like increased aggression or mental health outcomes, 
  it 's worth noting that the gershoff study showed that spanking does increase immediate compliance which could be what this is reflecting . 
  however , it also found that it reduced long-term behaviour change ( i.e. , fear = stopping but not learning ), 
  look no further than the stanford and milgram studies . 
  remember that the milgram study came right after ww2 . 
  a lot of people thought it was a cop-out that too easily explained what the nazis did . 
  protip : negative reinforcement is different to punishment . 
  negative reinforcement is when a behaviour is reinforced by taking away a negative stimulus ( for example , walking away from something scary ) . 
  otherwise , i 'm not trying to say that the child learns nothing , i 'm saying that the science says it 's a poor strategy . 
  i 'm not telling you what to believe , you 're entitled to your own opinion . 
  do n't know of anything off the top of my head but that would be pretty difficult to study . 
  you disagreeing with the findings does n't make it not science . 
  just saying . 
  it also says to stone them for disobedience . 
  i would n't try that either . 
  i 'm really , really sorry that you feel like you deserved it . 
  i look forward to your published paper that dissects and proves this paper wrong . 
  biassed in the scientific sense . 
  i 've never said this paper answers everything . 
  in fact , over and over i 've said that i 'm not going to tell people what to think , i 'm just presenting the evidence . 
  i do n't doubt that , i 'm still very sorry that you feel like you `` deserved '' to be hit by the people who are supposed to love and care for you no matter what . 
  honestly , i kind of agree but this is a bit of a flies with honey situation . 
  i 've posted about this a bunch of times on reddit before and let 's just say that it 's not met with a lot of positivity haha, 
  i never said it was . 
  i said it 's a bad strategy according to the science . 
  terrible strategy to change behaviour was fairly hyperbolic but i was trying to summarise a 41 page complicated meta-analysis into a 3 line answer haha . 
  the confounders on this stuff are really damn complicated , i would n't even know where to start . 
  not to be racist but all me 's look the same . 
  you 're welcome to your opinion , i 'm just presenting the science . 
  thanks, 
  no problems , have a read of [ this ] ( http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/ ) website too, 
  ca n't tell if sarcastic ... 
  it would definitely be published , it would be a compelling result . 
  there 's a saying - you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar . 
  it means that in some situations you 're better off being nice to get your point across .
