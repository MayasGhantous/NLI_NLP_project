  hey , if it stops a kid from being hit it was easily worth it . 
  let me know if you need any help with the language , just pm me . 
  i was responding to ops story , not qoveneob, 
  well that 's the implication of sdt . 
  the idea is that kinds need to feel unconditional love to be able to be their `` true self '' . 
  for example , a recent study showed that receiving unconditional love partly determined whether a gay person would be out or a self-hating homophobe . 
  no stress at all , 
  see edit, 
  you 're welcome to believe what you like , i 'm just presenting the science . 
  for science !, 
  woah , cool . 
  thanks, 
  it 's hard to tell on the internet sometimes . 
  as you 'd see if you looked at my user page , i 've spent the last 3 hours receiving angry messages from kids who were spanked and `` turned out fine '' so i probably was responding very quickly . 
  i 'm glad you were able to identify with that and i 'm really glad it 's helped you find some clarity . 
  those sorts of issues are totally things you can work through with a counsellor so i encourage you to do so if you feel happy to do so . 
  a ) all psych studies are context dependant so you should never assume it 's universally true . 
  b ) the problem is that you want to teach your kids ** other ** ways to deal with problems . 
  you do n't want your kids to hit another kid because they do n't know how to deal with the other kid acting like an ass . 
  you want to teach them to express their feelings or learn to walk away or whatever the case may be . 
  i 'm not saying deny the world , i 'm just saying that you can teach them better tools than aggression . 
  c ) the point is that it does n't . 
  the research shows that it increases immediate compliance ( i do n't want to be hit again so i wo n't do it ) but does n't create behaviour change . 
  fear is a good motivator , that doens ' t mean it 's a good teaching tool . 
  the other problem is that kids are wired to trust their parents . 
  i 've had maybe 15 people message me already to say that they were hit as a kid and `` deserved it '' . 
  it 's breaking my heart . 
  if you 're a kid getting hit by your parents , you have two choices . 
  you can believe that they 're evil monsters who want to hurt you or you can believe that you 're bad/broken/wrong . 
  you can explain it to them as much you want but when you hit a kid , it 's an extreme situation . 
  they do n't have the cognitive capacity to say `` well , i can see that this was a really extreme situation that i should avoid again in the future and the only reason they 'd hit me was for my own protection . 
  i 'll stop doing this one behaviour '' . 
  i 'm not trying to say that if you hit your kid once they 'll instantly become mentally ill or something ridiculous like that , i 'm just saying that it has ** a lot ** more effect than other forms of punishment . 
  i never said it conclusively proves my point as that would be a stupid statement . 
  see edit 3, 
  you 're welcome to believe what you like , i 'm just presenting the science . 
  that does n't mean that spanking is good , it just means that his alternative parenting style was worse . 
  i agree with your conclusion though . 
  yeah , the guy quoting scientific studies is the enemy of progress , not the one ignoring them in favour of their own subjective opinion . 
  i like that, 
  sorry , i 've had well over a hundred replies to this and i am trying to respond to most of them so i apologise if i read it too quickly . 
  i 've never understood trying to meet new people in loud places . 
  unless your entire goal is to get laid by being a good dancer ( no problems if it is your goal ) , why the hell would you want to meet people in a place where shouting is a pre-requisite ? 
  haha , all good mate . 
  the paper talks about all sorts of spanking as punishment . 
  i think that there are far better parenting strategies . 
  i wo n't tell anyone not to do it but i think the evidence is that it 's not effective and has negative outcomes . 
  you 're welcome to believe whatever you want , i 'm just presenting the science . 
  i ca n't make you believe it . 
  type of hitting and emotions displayed are fairly hard to quantify in research terms . 
  they did look at frequency though, 
   nothing teaches a lesson like a good smack . 
  according to the research , smacks do n't teach well at all . 
  ever had a raging erection at the physiotherapist while they 're working on your groin muscle ? 
  it did in my head . 
  that did not help the erection situation . 
  yes , you should definitely donate . 
  donate plasma if you 're really concerned about this but it 's a silly concern . 
  your brain stops working . 
  your brain is you . 
  you ca n't exist without your brain . 
  it 's very similar to what it was like before you were born . 
  it 's okay to say it 's too much work . 
  what is n't okay is committing to being with her when you 're not okay with it . 
  it 's not fair to you or her but to some extent you have a bigger responsibility to be sure about how you feel before entering into anything long-term with her . 
  with time , parts of it will get easier and parts will get harder but you ca n't expect to radically change how you feel . 
  you ca n't go into this saying `` it 's too hard now but when i connect more with the kids it will be okay '' . 
  you have really , truly ask yourself if you can be with someone if this is the condition . 
  if yes , that 's okay . 
  if not , that 's okay too . 
  ** there is no right answer ** except your being honest with yourself about how you feel . 
  winnie also [ writes math books ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danica_mckellar#books ) now . 
  shock and horror, 
  i used to be a super-picky eater . 
  in fact pretty much all i ate was vegemite . 
  that 's right , i used to have vegemite on pasta . 
  mmmm . 
  now i eat tonnes of different foods .

  i hate all musicians who make music that is n't intended for my specific demographic . 
  that 's why i hate justin bieber too . 
  you sure proved me wrong, 
  that sounds horribly emotionally manipulative , whether she meant to be or not . 
  i believe you that she was sincere , i 'm just saying that from your perspective that 's very emotionally challenging . 
  i 've replied to dozens of people in this thread . 
  you were by far the most aggressive and closed-minded of anyone . 
  read my user page history , i 've been replying to people * all day * . 
  i 'm not telling you what to believe , i 'm just telling you what the science is . 
  i ca n't make you believe it 's right .
