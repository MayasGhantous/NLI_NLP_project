  upvote for honesty . 
  being able to admit that you have biases does n't make you a bad person , it makes you an honest person . 
  however , if you act on it , fuck you . 
  fair enough . 
  my depression was the best thing that ever happened to me . 
  let me be clear , it was a horrific experience that lasted for years and as i was going through it i begged and pleaded for it to stop . 
  however , going through it allowed me to break myself down and build myself back up in a way that i could n't have possibly otherwise . 
  i 'm now 10x happier than i ever was and realise that i needed to go through that process . 
  please do, 
  masturbating furiously . 
  seriously though , i tried online dating . 
  worked like a charm . 
  well , that is one of the ideas behind [ dissociative identity disorder ] ( http://www.behavenet.com/dissociative-identity-disorder ) ( formerly called multiple personality disorder ) . 
  another interesting dissociative disorder ( dissociation simply means a split from reality ) is dissociative fugue . 
  in this condition , the sufferer will leave their current situation , often to another state or city and start a new life for a period of time . 
  when that period is over , they 'll have no recollection of what they did in that time and then go back to their old life . 
  it 's a very mysterious disorder but the idea seems to be the same as did , when there is significant enough trauma , the brain can alter reality in a way that makes the experience manageable . 
  read more about dissociative disorders [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociative_disorder ), 
  edit : to be clear , most of the `` fan theories '' in that thread would probably have been dissociative identity disorder , not dissociative fugue . 
  i probably got a bit carried away explaining that because it 's so fascinating and most people have heard of did . 
  yes and there 's a reason that science does n't rely on people 's biased and subjective opinion of their own upbringing . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're wrong , i 'm just saying that from a ** scientific ** perspective , it 's irrelevant . 
  i 'm just presenting a scientific argument , not telling you what to believe .

  i have no issues with this thread a all , just making sure everyone is clear on the rules . 
  you too, 
  holy shit you do, 
  yeah but a big part of that is how feminine his features are, 
  exactly . 
  she has the right to be annoyed , he has the right to ignore her and do it anyway , she has a right to say that she deserves better and leave him . 
  everyone has the right to feel/say what they want , you just do n't have the right to expect them to change for you . 
  my girlfriend is suspiciously out of the house right now . 
  i 'm kind of worried . 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
  paul bloom 's stuff is a great watch anyway . 
  i highly recommend it . 
  edit : also worth noting that there is a ** huge ** disparity in cases of did in different countries . 
  the whole area of dissociative disorders is fairly messy at the moment . 
  i am certain that there are dissociative disorders that are incredibly bizarre and affect those who have suffered a significant trauma but the books certainly are n't closed on what those disorders are and how they 're defined . 
  for what ? 
  i * did * say that, 
  ** my personal feelings about love : **, 
  you are certainly wrong . 
  if you think you can fall in love with someone from just looking at them , you have ** absolutely ** no idea what love is . 
  i 'm not trying to be a cock , my point is that love is deeper than that . 
  love is about knowing someone on every level . 
  it 's about wanting them to be happy more than you want it for yourself . 
  it 's about having someone who you can take care of without flinching . 
  that you never have to worry how they feel about you . 
  most importantly , love is messy . 
  it 's hard , it 's complicated and you get hurt sometimes . 
  but , when you find it , it 's worth every bit of hurt . 
  ** a psychological understanding of love ** :, 
  in the psych research there are three parts of relationships that are present in different levels . 
  there 's commitment ( devotion to someone ) , intimacy ( ability to share and have closeness ) and passion ( attraction and excitement ) . 
  when you have all 3 , that creates `` consumate '' love and is considered the ultimate type of relationship . 
  typically , relationships have highest levels of passion at the start and intimacy/commitment develop over time . 
  however , passion needs to be maintained , otherwise it becomes `` companionate '' love . 
  the other two types are romantic ( intimacy + passion ) and fatuous ( passion + commitment ) . 
  this is one of the core theories and there are variations but they 're all kind of similar . 
  that 's not really accurate . 
  it 's obviously based off chemicals but to call it an addiction is n't really accurate . 
  because they will live out another one while they 're gone . 
  i 've never seen a case , i 'm going off my psychopathology lecturer 's description . 
  it 's not an addiction in the chemical sense , you have basis for saying that . 
  it 's certainly created by the presence of neurochemicals ( large amounts of dopamine early followed by higher levels of oxytocin as the bond is formed ) but it 's inaccurate to call it addiction . 
  i believe that 's the case , yes but there are all sorts of explanations including poor diagnosis of it in countries that have less focus on mental health . 
  you feel so bad because you 're grieving a loss . 
  you 're losing what your relationship * is * and what you were hoping it would be in the future . 
  it 's no different to the loss you feel when someone dies . 
  you 're not addicted to your grandmother , you 're just sad because you lost what she was in your life and what you 'd hoped you would experience together in the future . 
  most notably dopamine ( excitement ) and oxytocin ( bonding ) . 
  not famous at all . 
  fame is overrated . 
  i do n't have an issue with saying it 's chemicals in the brain , i have an issue with you calling it an addiction . 
  it 's scientifically inaccurate , as i 've explained over and over . 
  in fact , i told you precisely ** which ** chemicals were involved a few comments ago . 
  if you 're not even reading what i 'm saying i wo n't bother replying anymore . 
  you fixed nothing , you made it worse . 
  [ actually fixed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuf2b9wkzr4 ), 
  because `` addiction '' means something specific . 
  it does n't fit the definition of addiction ad it 's not accurate to call it that . 
  are you asking if the same disparity would exist for , say depression , as there is for did ? 
  i 'm not downvoting what you say and it 's not ** my ** definition , it 's ** the ** definition .

  wow, 
  she is making a ** huge ** mistake by dating this quickly . 
  there is no way she 's over and she 's setting herself ( and her dates ) up for a lot of problems .
