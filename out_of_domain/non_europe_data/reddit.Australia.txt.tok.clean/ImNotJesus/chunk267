  ** however ** , that 's not your issue right now . 
  your focus is getting through this stage . 
  you do that by letting yourself * grieve * . 
  think of this like a death . 
  you have to go through the sadness and grief of what you 've lost . 
  not just what you had but what you were looking forward to in the future . 
  in time , the sting reduces and you 'll be able to move on ( when it 's healthy to do so ) . 
  let it take time and do n't rush the process . 
  5 days . 
  at the time , it was `` for fun '' . 
  in hindsight , it was an emotional breakdown . 
  take my love , take my land ... 
  i 'll take the fact that you 've been studying them and did n't call me an idiot that my description was at least okay haha, 
  i had to have 3 energy drinks but i got there . 
  i removed my ipod usb without telling itunes first . 
  a lady in line for the showers at a music festival ( after having no prior conversation with me ) poked me in the stomach with her toothbrush and accused me of having a `` typical apathetic white mother '' after calling me `` a bit chubby '', 
  you never go ass to mouth, 
  are you male/female and hetero/homosexual ? 
  in that case do you think it 's possible that you 're sexually attracted to physically dominant men ? 
  / r/doesanybodyelse, 
  i 'm not brave enough for / r/all/new , some of the nsfw sites that come up ... wow . 
  i just use my / new page . 
  anyone who complains about the quality of the front page has never spent more than 10 minutes in / new . 
  it should be a pre-requisite to complain . 
  i feel the same way about glory holes, 
  protip : put the pill under your tongue and drink a glass of water as fast as you can, 
  i upvoted you but you dno ' t know what you 're getting yourself into . 
  each time you need a bigger and bigger fix until you 're lying in a pool of your own urine and feces , saying `` just one more '' , `` just one more '' . 
  have you ever tried meditating ? 
  mindfulness meditation is having incredible research findings in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.marc.ucla.edu ) is a link the ucla 's mindfulness research centre . 
  they discuss some of the research and have some guided meditations to try . 
  a few minutes a day will ** literally ** change the shape of your brain . 
  studies show that this is n't actually true . 
  if you win the lottery , after a year you return to your base level of happiness . 
  the same is true of losing a limb . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ) is dan gilbert 's ted talk on it . 
  masturbating furiously . 
  so , it would be no different to a normal day . 
  i 've found that if you use any simple rule to judge people you 're making a big mistake . 
  i ask them to stop for a moment and talk to me . 
  i 'll start by asking them what 's making them so upset . 
  then , i do a lot more listening then talking . 
  at some point , when their emotion has died down a little bit , i 'll start talking to them about what kind of outcome they 're looking for and we 'll talk about how i can help them achieve that . 
  i 'm sorry but your sister has passed on . 
  her brain stopped working and there 's no part of her that could have kept living . 
  the noises you 're hearing are house creaks or wind or something else . 
  i 'll be honest , i pulled that number out of my ass . 
  i was just making fun of myself, 
  nah , just had some training in this stuff . 
  i 'll have a better answer in three months when i 'm a fully qualified phone counsellor on a suicide prevention hotline . 
  well , look , i 've probably done it a few times , i just ca n't tell you a particular night . 
  hey op , that sounds like you 've had some rough experiences but it 's great that you at least have some awareness of where it comes from . 
  have you considered talking through some of those issues with a psychologist ? 
  they 're definitely things that can be improved and it sounds like it would improve your quality of life . 
  i 'm pretty emotionally shut off myself and it came from my childhood too . 
  but , i 've come a long way since my depression a couple of years ago ( i 'm sure my so would say i have a lot further to go too ) . 
  the point is that * it gets better * if you 're willing to do the work required to get through this . 
  i 'm just like you , i was way too scared to have a meaningful connection to anyone but now i live with my partner , i have friends that i feel truly close to and it also helped me find a career that i 'm incredibly passionate about . 
  if you want to talk to me in private about this stuff , feel free to pm me . 
  probably because you 're so whiny . 
  are you dealing with a suicidal friend ? 
  you may be aware of your `` problems '' but clearly from your anger towards other people , you do n't feel like you have the tools to change this in any meaningful way , do you ? 
  i was very hesitant when i started seeing a psychologist but it was the best decision i 've ever made . 
  just someone who is happy to talk about their experience if it helps others . 
  she was n't my best friend when we started going out but she is now . 
  you need to find out if he has any specific plans . 
  there 's a big difference in threat between `` i do n't want to live anymore '' and `` i have a bottle of pills sitting next to me '' . 
  mostly , you need to recognise that you 're in no way able to handle this . 
  you can be his friend , you can be supportive but you 're not responsible for him . 
  do not take on more than you can and most importantly , try to encourage him to seek professional help . 
  you can even offer to take him to his first appointment . 
  you * can * do it that way . 
  the easiest one to start with is breathing meditation . 
  you sit quietly with your eyes closed and focus on your breath . 
  notice where you feel your breath , is it in your nose , in your stomach etc. 
  keep your focus on the breath . 
  as time goes by , you 'll lose focus on your breath and notice that your attention is elswhere . 
  this is normal and all you want to do is ** gently ** remind yourself to focus on your breath and regain the attention . 
  you can focus on anything though . 
  sometimes i 'll do sound meditation ( just noticing the sensation of sounds around me ) or you can do body scans , all sorts of things . 
  the key is finding your main focus and trying to gently let it remain there . 
  i 'll give you tree fiddy, 
  because the vast majority of users are white americans and christianity is the largest problem for them . 
   christianity is dominant and there 's more ` lul fuk atheist ' christians than ** muslims ** or jews . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm calling bullshit on that one . 
  yeah , just the other day . 
  i was sitting at breakfast with my wife and it was just like any other normal day . 
  i meant to say `` can you please pass the ketchup '' but what came out was `` you fucking bitch you ruined my life '', 
  thanks , de . 
  my first post on here , clearly a failure . 
  your # 1 role is to let him know that you love him and you 're there for him , within certain boundaries . 
  your # 2 role is getting him to a professional . 
  ahh , i removed the evidence . 
  like when i play music loudly so no-one can hear the rubbing sound . 
  the ** scientific evidence ** says that it 's true . 
  if you have two people of similar happiness and you take one and chop off a limb . 
  you take the other and give them lottery winnings , it 's pretty easy to guess who will be happier . 
  after only ** one year ** their happiness will be similar again .
