  dan gilbert talks about this much more in his [ ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ) on the topic . 
  there 's a whole area of psychology called affective forecasting and the tl ; dr is that we 're very poor at guessing how much things will affect us . 
  we project sad things to be much sadder than they are and happy things to be much happier than we are . 
  most importantly , it seems that we adjust ** very quickly ** to any new situation . 
  try asking him what sort of help and what he did/didn ' t get out of it . 
  at the end of the day , just reiterate that you love/support him but there are people out there that can really help him , much more than you can . 
  let him know that if he is n't happy with the help he got , he can find someone different and better . 
  also , if you can buy a little jar of truffle salt ( cost me $ 25 and lasts for months ) , it can take your risotto to the next level . 
  my co-workers chatting . 
  i assume that anyone walking behind me is probably about to hit me in the back of my head and steal my phone . 
  i live in an upper-middle class suburb in melbourne . 
  the odds of it happening are n't exactly huge . 
  because through the process of dating i found one of the many people that would 've been suitable enough partners to make my life better than being by myself . 
  the oc ? 
  glad to help . 
  if you do n't like breathing meditation , you could try [ this ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/deep-relaxation-guided-meditation/id434139276?mt=2#ls=1 ) instead . 
  the usual treatment for phobias is [ systematic desensitisation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systematic_desensitization ), 
  oh right , happy to help , 
  you have no dilemma . 
  this is ** none ** of your business . 
  for all you know they 're in an open relationship , or she 's cheating too or he 's an alien and he was recharging his alien powers by devouring her essence . 
  stay out . 
  as much as i 'm enjoying ~ ~ it ~ ~ studying at the moment , i 'm pretty excited about being able to start practising psychology and hopefully getting my thesis published . 
  edit : clarity, 
  a good father who teaches morals , resilience , emotional awareness and empathy . 
  yup , the same idea still applies . 
  i 'm still a long way off , pal . 
  just really looking forward to the next stage . 
  the reason it 's controversial is n't a question of whether it 's a real link , it 's that even if there was a real link it changes nothing . 
  it 's the human condition and it 's called habituation ( there 's obviously some variation when it comes to material needs but the idea is still the same ) . 
  it 's largely a good trait ( helps maintain equilibrium and fight helplessness ) but it gets in the way of our happiness sometimes . 
  there was a brilliant study that showed that given the same base level of happiness ( before either event ) after only ** one year ** both a lottery winner and an amputee will return to that same level of happiness . 
  we adjust to our surroundings very quickly .

  what the anus said . 
  you 're allowed to be upset , just explain why it 's different to porn for you . 
  if he 's not okay with changing his behaviour , you have to decide if that 's a deal-breaker for you . 
  that 's the point though , you defined a boundary together . 
  he may be willing to draw that boundary , he may not be . 
  either way , they both have to decide how important this is to them . 
  if you have an issue with the decision , you should message karmanaut or the / r/iama mods as a group . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fiama ) is a link to message those mods . 
  we did n't ban him on / r/askreddit and i personally discussed the issue with him . 
  there is no risk of him being banned from askreddit as long as he stays within the guidelines that i discussed with him . 
  it was never about that . 
  karmanaut felt that him linking his website on every post was essentially spamming and not a behaviour that would be accepted by anyone with less notoriety . 
  the idea was that he should n't be treated any differently to people with no karma . 
  no sir . 
  never was . 
  as i 've said , the best thing you can do is send a ** friendly ** message to the mods of / r/iama explaining your feelings on the matter . 
  they may/may not change their decision but it 's your best way to get your voice heard . 
  you would probably get a lot of benefit talking to a psychologist about it . 
  what you 've gone through is an immense trauma and you 're not `` broken '' or in need of `` fixing '' but it 's your best chance to come out of this situation in the strongest way possible . 
  edit : clarity, 
  i never said it was the ** right ** decision , i 'm just telling you what his reasoning was . 
  if you need to talk to someone about what type of therapy to seek or have any concerns , i 'll be happy to clarify them for you either here or in pm . 
  honestly , i do n't think it 's that absurd . 
  i know that wo n't be a popular answer here but it 's what i believe . 
  the fact is , if he 's posting a link to his own personal website ( where he sells products ) on every post , as well as editting all of his old posts to include a link to his website , he * is * essentially spamming . 
  the point is that any other user would get banned for spamming if they did the same thing . 
  now , i think that the situation did n't require a ban , a discussion makes more sense , but as far as the reasoning goes i do n't think it 's crazy . 
  sure , well let 's start with the major types of therapy , you can see what would speak to you most . 
  studies have shown that for most conditions , all forms of therapy are similarly effective . 
  they all have their pro 's and con 's and i personally believe that the biggest factor is finding a good therapist and a type of therapy that matches your strengths/weaknesses . 
  it 's worth remembering that most therapists will use a combination ( of these and others ) but here are the big 4 :, 
  ** cognitive behavioural therapy ** - this is about identifying maladaptive thought processes and learning how to change them by analysing the meaning * added * to what 's actually happening . 
  for example , your friend cancels a lunch date . 
  logically , all that 's probably happened is that they 're busy but we add meaning . 
  maybe they 're angry at me about something . 
  maybe they do n't really like me . 
  maybe i 'm not loveable . 
  you learn to identify these thought patterns and challenge them . 
  ** mindfulness based stress reduction ** - this is based off mindfulness meditation . 
  mindfulness meditation has had incredibly good research results in the last 10 years or so , showing that it 's brilliant at reducing anxious and depressive symptoms . 
  in mbsr , you learn to meditate effectively and how to use those tools to change your experience of the world . 
  of course , you can start this without the therapist . 
  ucla have a whole page devoted to research on mindfulness - [ link ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu ) - and some guided meditations to try out . 
  ** acceptance and commitment therapy ** - act is centred around the idea that we have really bad aims when it comes to attaining our goals . 
  it 's all about re-conceptualising what we want and learning how to get it . 
  you can do a lot of act from books on the topic - [ book ] ( http://www.thehappinesstrap.com/ ) and [ extra resources ] ( http://www.actmindfully.com.au/free_resources ), 
  ** psychodynamic psychotherapy ** - this is the modern version of freudian psychoanalysis . 
  this is the `` tell me about your mother '' sort of therapy and it 's around working out where your upsets started . 
  for example , if eating is an issue for you perhaps you learned to use it as a coping mechanism when you were younger . 
  that 's a very quick run down , i 'd be happy to explain them further if you need . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  psychiatrist - doctor who specialises in mental health . 
  fewer appointments , more expensive and can prescribe . 
  psychologist - study only mental health and therapy , ca n't prescribe . 
  counsellor - basically a psychologist with less training . 
  you probably want a psychologist . 
  are there any other terms you 're unsure about ? 
  it 's the legal consulation part i was worried about, 
  nah i would n't go there . 
  try to find a psych ** ologist ** not a psychiatrist . 
  yup . 
  study after study has shown it works in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms . 
  also , only a few minutes a day leads to thickening of the prefrontal cortex .
