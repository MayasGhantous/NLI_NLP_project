  that 's the whole point . 
  meditation is hard and you 'll have to keep practising but being bad at it actually means you get ** more ** benefit . 
  try some guided mindfulness meditations from that link and just be really kind to yourself when you do it . 
  expect to be shit at it . 
  edit : just thought i 'd add that if you 've had problems with breathing meditations in the past , [ here ] ( http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/deep-relaxation-guided-meditation/id434139276?mt=2#ls=1 ) are a totally different type of meditation ( also from ucla ) . 
  no problems at all . 
  let me know how you go and try meditating in the mean time . 
  medi ** t ** ation, 
  medi ** t ** ation, 
  that runs quite counter to the current research . 
  how did it add fuel to your depression ? 
  please feel free to not answer but i study psychology ( and will practise one day - most likely using some meditation in some instances ) so this is really good information for me . 
  do you mind me asking what you did when the unwanted thoughts came into your mind ? 
  did you fight them ? 
  did you dwell on them ? 
  yeah that happened to me a bit when i started . 
  one thing that really helped me was learning that being `` bad '' at meditation - losing focus constantly - actually meant that you get better results . 
  the idea is that the benefit does n't come from focussing on your breathing , it comes from gently moving your focus ** back ** to the breathing . 
  once i learned that i became less anxious when i lost my focus . 
  fair enough , i was n't trying to convince you to try again , just sharing my experience and hoping to learn from yours . 
  do you mind me asking if you see anyone for the depression ? 
  understandable . 
  well , if you ever want to talk about your options for seeing a different kind of therapist or some stuff you can do to help your situation , feel free to pm me any time . 
  i discussed it with him in private so i 'm not going to say exactly what was discussed without his permission . 
  he had an assumption of privacy when talking to me and i 'm not going to betray that . 
  you can `` feel '' whatever you like . 
  this was a private matter between him and the mods and it 's fair to * him * to say them publicly without his express consent . 
  if you want to ask him , feel free to do so . 
  if he consents , i 'll gladly talk about it . 
  the issue was n't linking to his own picture , it was with him linking his picture and then using it as a stage to also promote his website . 
  again , i 'm not saying it 's necessarily fair ** in this case ** , i 'm saying that if someone else consistently did the same , they would be banned for spamming . 
  no problems at all , probably good you asked me as others may be under that impression too . 
  i just wish people did n't downvote my post as a response to disagreeing . 
  i had no part in the decision to ban him ( and actively defended him in askreddit ) but more importantly it 's just hiding the relevant information from people who want to know what 's going on . 
  it 's not unreasonable to be protective over your younger sister and it certainly does n't * necessarily * mean that he 's sexist . 
  keep meditating !, 
  hold on ... just looking for the part where he said that he could n't trust her ... still looking ... 
  oh wait , he never said that . 
  he said he was hoping that his friend treats her well , which says nothing about her ability to make decisions . 
  also , even if he did , you can trust someone and still show concern for them . 
  not a problem at all . 
  it 's not the first time where people get upset at one mod and other mods get hit with collateral damage . 
  i genuinely appreciate the apology though , they 're rare on the interwebs . 
  i 'm not a mod on / r/iama but i am here . 
  as i said to you in another message , i 'm not a mod there , i 'm just telling you the most appropriate way to voice your concern . 
  i 'm not going to promise that they 're going to change their mind , that would be silly . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're getting so angry at me . 
  you 're welcome to approach this how you like , all i was doing is giving my opinion . 
  given that i 'm a mod of a large subreddit , i felt i had * some * knowledge on the topic . 
  you 're more than welcome to ignore my advice . 
  1 ) i 'll reiterate ** again ** that i 'm not a mod of / r/iama and i had no part of his banning, 
  2 ) we 're not a `` gang '' , we 're volunteers trying to be as fair as we can to everyone . 
  if you do n't agree with it , please message the mods ** of that subreddit ** . 
  3 ) i 'm not trying to be obnoxious , i 'm trying to be respectful to sw . 
  it 's not fair to him to talk in confidence and then tell everyone what was said . 
  he does n't have `` special rules '' , we just discussed a fair compromise about how he could go about things . 
  zippy . 
  you need to take a deep breath . 
  you 're getting very angry at me despite telling you over and over that i had ** no part in his banning ** . 
  i 'll say this one more time . 
  if you have a problem with the decision , my best advice is to take that up with the mods of / r/iama . 
  i even provided a helpful link so it was easy for people to do so . 
  as for whether i would unban them in a subreddit i was responsible for , that would really depend on why they were banned . 
  if it were a core rule of the subreddit , probably not . 
  if it was someone acting rashly or a compromise could be found , i would . 
  i 'm not going to give you a sweeping answer because it would be on a case by case basis . 
  you 're right and i probably should n't have said anything . 
  i 'm in a bind because i want to show you how much of a non-thing our discussion was but i 'm not willing to break his confidence so i guess i 'll just have to cop it . 
  to be clear , i 'm not allowing him to break any rules that do n't apply to anyone else , i just suggested a way that he could promote himself in a way that does n't constitute spam . 
   but the point here is that sw is definitely contributing vastly more than he is spamming . 
  i agree and certainly do n't want him gone, 
  i do n't think you read what i said properly . 
  if you have a problem with him being banned in / r/iama tell those mods . 
  he was n't banned in askreddit, 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  ** pepsi ** comes up casually in conversation all the time because of the refreshing taste . 
  being a badass is 90 % of killing people in movies . 
  same with the phone . 
  this is a big one for me . 
  oh i got hit in the head so hard i was asleep for a few hours ? 
  that 's a fucking coma , not being knocked out .

  note : this is as of a year ago . 
  but , given the change in the score fudging system , it 's very possible that those remain the same . 
  he banned someone on / r/iama for spamming and now people believe he did it because that person had more karma than him . 
  it 's just your stock-standard reddit drama with everything being blown insanely out of proportions , lots of bs information going around and it 'll be forgotten about in 2 days . 
  he did n't ban the ama , he banned shitty_watercolor from posting in / r/iama because he was spamming his website, 
  chilli con carne . 
  i love making up a huge batch ( about 1kg of beef and 500g of chorizo ) and eating it for days . 
  delicious . 
  fine !, 
  people that do n't say goodbye or end a call properly . 
  exactly , it only feels natural to have a cool , refreshing bottle of pepsi on the table because it 's the natural accompaniment of all things entertaining . 
  many millions of people , it was a fairly popular show . 
  ca n't tell if genuine praise or random snark ... 
  maybe try to offer a compromise : i 'll only play x amount of time a day and if you break that rule , they can take it away .
