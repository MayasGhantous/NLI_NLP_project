  the health care system in australia is pretty fucking good . 
  because you 're asking me to show you proof that does n't exist . 
  as i said , it is primarily a function of the prefrontal cortex but it 's much more complicated than that . 
  i also gave you several resources to learn more about it but you 're much more worried about who is right and wrong . 
  i do n't care if you think i 'm right or not , i was just trying to give you information . 
  i do n't care what you think about me or if you think i 'm making shit up to win an argument on the internet . 
  this is an area i do a lot of research in because i 'm passionate about it and if you do n't want to learn more about it that 's fine but if you do look at those resources i previously mentioned . 
  this is my last post on the issue because you 're clearly in a i 'm right , he 's wrong mindset and i do n't really care for trying to win an argument . 
  by `` make it yourself '' i mean make better content . 
  if you think that you can make better rage comics than what is being made then do it . 
  if you think that the f7u12 community has changed so much that it does n't appeal to you anymore make a new community . 
  the point is that the upvote system is a capitalist/democratic one , the content people like most comes to the top . 
  i would suggest seeing a doctor, 
  once . 
  by a chain of cinemas that hired 13 people and fired 11 after a 3month probation period despite be getting over 95 % on my two evaluations . 
  also , i was stealing popcorn . 
  yes . 
  unless you 're with a girl that you 've been with for a long time and you very much trust ** wear a condom ** . 
  i worked in a call centre one time and my boss pulled me into a meeting with him to say that he 'd been looking through my call logs and i was averaging 1.5 calls an hours for the past week . 
  he was not happy . 
  kept the job and still got a good reference though . 
  arrested development, 
  because no-one is surprised that the movie star with a history of sexual abuse has a sordid past . 
  people expected weiner to be a president one day . 
  ** log off reddit **, 
  to make the voices stop . 
  mainly for relaxation , i rarely have more than 2 glasses of red, 
  i keep telling my so that i want to name my first born son lebron jr. ( even though my name is michael and we 're australian ) she does not love this idea . 
  i do n't know because i 've never bought marijuana officer, 
  yes , it is that big . 
  i 'm in australia spamming f5 on the askreddit queue and writing silly answers to 90 % of the questions , incredibly serious answers to the other 10 % . 
  guess which is which !, 
  moonlight sonata, 
  seek therapy , it can really help ( did for me ), 
  if you 're having panic attacks i would strongly suggest seeing a therapist as talking through this will really help you get through this difficult time . 
  besides that it 's important to grieve a relationship in the same way you would any loss . 
  you need to get to a point where you accept that it 's gone and this can only happen through mourning the loss . 
  try to be around people , avoid rebound sex , alcohol , drugs , etc. 
  as they 'll only make you feel worse . 
  just try to find things that reaffirm your personal identity - pick up a hobby , find something you enjoy doing . 
  go to sleep , it 's late there . 
  this may sound crazy but you should consider talking to her . 
  buy them dinner, 
  if you have n't formally met :, 
  `` hi , my name is kingvegemite '' then just start talking . 
  if you have formally met :, 
  `` hey derpette , how are you ? '', 
  the just start talking . 
  do n't build her up in your head to be some image because she 's not . 
  she 's a person , just like you are . 
  if she 's nice and easy to talk to then great , it 'll be easy to ask her out for coffee . 
  if she 's a bitch then whatever , no big loss , you saved yourself buying coffee for a bitch . 
  absolutely nothing as long as you accept there are certain things you ca n't do without a college degree . 
  if they 're not things you * want * to do then it does n't matter , does it ? 
  mostly it 's because their mothers drank heavily during the pregnancy, 
  oh dear god no , that would be way too depressing . 
  not all men are the same . 
  not all women are the same . 
  there 's nothing wrong with having some effeminate features and it 's far more important that you 're accepting of yourself as a person . 
  you ca n't become effeminate just by playing with dolls so you do n't need to worry that you 're only this way because it 's how you grew up . 
  it sounds like you 've got a lot of things going for you that most men do n't ( in touch with your feelings , empathy etc. ), 
  and that 's brilliant even though it can be really hard growing up and trying to fit into a role of what you think masculinity is supposed to mean ( i struggled with this too - even though i 'm a big , strong guy i 'm very empathic and care a lot more about emotions than any of my friends ) . 
  i guess the point is that you 're 25 years old now and you 're allowed to define what sort of man you want to be . 
  that can be the kind of man that always tries to appear tough for the sake of his family or the kind of man that cares about everyone 's emotions . 
  it does n't matter , they 're not right or wrong , they 're just different ways of trying to work out how to do it . 
  be who you are and enjoy what that provides . 
  it sounds trite and i 've said it on here before but if you 're looking for a proper , loving relationship , all you need to do is be yourself . 
  because , the whole point of being in a love relationship is that you 're with someone who accepts you for who you are , who loves you because of all your faults not in spite of them . 
  if you try to play a role then you 'll end up with someone that likes that role but not someone that can love you in that way . 
  now that you 're an adult it 'll be much easier to find someone that wants a guy who they can connect with emotionally ( most girls have gone through their phase where they get treated badly and have decided that they deserve better ) . 
  just be yourself because the person who is attracted to that is the person you want to be with . 
  your song - elton john, 
  simple , elegant , beautiful . 
  see a doctor . 
  please do n't ever get medical advice from people on the internet . 
  i 'm not really sure whether this is supposed to be a joke or not since it 's not funny but if you 're genuinely interested it 's because we evolved from creatures that did n't walk upright . 
  jeff or pete ? 
  i always thought that ep was very sondheim, 
  jenny mccarthy without a fucking doubt, 
  edit : just in case anyone does n't know why , it 's because she 's personally responsible for an immense number of people not giving their kids vaccinations which has lead to not only deaths but outbreaks of diseases that we had controlled . 
  it 's a question of functionality . 
  we ca n't function as humans if we 're consciously considering all the dangers around us , that 's why our unconscious filters the information for us . 
  what happens when we hear about these things is called mortality salience and there 's some really interesting psych research coming out about the effects it has on us . 
  if you want to learn more about it read up on terror management theory . 
  garden state is very good, 
  ** do not get medical advice from random people on the internet ** . 
  peta would probably throw blood on you for cruelty to animals . 
  just to be clear then why i have this concern . 
  no medically trained person would be stupid enough to answer medical questions over the internet . 
  therefore , the only people that are going to answer are morons . 
  i find the idea that someone says `` do n't worry that happened to me '' immensely terrifying . 
  what if that person has a serious disease ? 
  wow , that 's a really depressed walrus . 
  maybe you need a porpoise in life ? 
  my step-dad put a wheat pack ( like a heat pack filled with wheat that you put into the microwave ) for 14 minutes instead of 1:40 . 
  the entire house smelt like burnt toast for a week . 
  it partly depends why you 're not sleeping . 
  i used to be really , really passionate about teenage mutant ninja turtles . 
  now , i can take or leave it . 
  until about 6 months ago i did n't eat cheese or tomato .
