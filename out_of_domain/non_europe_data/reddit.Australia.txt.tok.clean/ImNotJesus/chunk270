  go talk to a therapist . 
  ** psychology **, 
  * basic understanding of emotional awareness, 
  * basic understanding of mental health issues ( what they are , how to get help ), 
  * basic distress coping skills . 
  how to deal with being emotionally upset , what 's productive/isn ' t productive, 
  * basic psych concepts that help understand the world better ( cognitive dissonance , heuristics/biases etc. ), 
  * what the different types of therapies are , why they work and how to use some of the tools in every day life ( reality testing from cbt , meditation from mbsr ), 
  so much more than that but they 're the top of my list . 
  i would 've loved a basic automotive class at school . 
  i wish i understood my car well enough to ( a ) not get ripped off and ( b ) do basic maintenance/repairs myself, 
  in that case , thank you , 
  just relax and enjoy the experience . 
  no-one is good their first time . 
  protip : do n't try to eat her face . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've been looking for this link for ages . 
  i 've googled geraffes so many times . 
  i lost it at, 
   edit : spelling, 
  not at all , it 's completely within your rights . 
  she may ignore you though . 
  i love when a tv show/movie early on kills a main ( ish ) character . 
  basically , i just want to know that all bets are off and anyone can go . 
  it builds so much more tension . 
  edit : i thoroughly regret posting this . 
  people keep replying with spoilers to movies . 
  really ? 
  it 's like that twist in that movie you saw ? 
  thank you for letting me know so i can be sure to know it 's coming . 
  i read that as `` actual psychics '' , i was about to start a huge rant . 
  karate kid , die hard , breakfast club and terminator too, 
  you need to shut the fuck up . 
  attitudes like this ruin lives . 
  mental illness has ** nothing ** to do with being `` soft '', 
  interesting question , this is conjecture but i think it would depend on your perspective of the cause ( s ) of ptsd . 
  one theory suggests that ptsd is about a loss of a sense of security in the world . 
  it 's a constant fear that something could go wrong . 
  part of me thinks that this would be no different in crusades times , especially with lower life expectancies and a lack of ability to contact family . 
  conversely , there 's probably some level of anchoring involved . 
  if your whole life is fear and insecurity , one would n't expect it in war time . 
  my sense is that it ** would ** have still been very common in those days . 
  ptsd essentially comes down to a severe trauma causing a situation where the sufferer is no longer able to cope with that distress . 
  i do n't think there 's any good reason to think it would n't have been the same back then . 
  during ww1 it was called `` shell shock '' or `` battle fatigue '' . 
  i never said that they were n't more accustomed to death , i said that mental illness has nothing to do with being `` soft '' . 
  you implied that getting ptsd was some sort of failing of mental fortitude . 
  this is completely and utterly false and has been studied extensively . 
  there ** are ** predictors of likelihood to develop ptsd but none of it is to do with being `` soft '' . 
  statements like that cause a lot of damage . 
  here 's a wikipedia page about [ combat stress reaction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_stress_reaction ) which was widely documented in world war 1 , well before `` narcotics were prescribed for maladies such as this '' . 
  also , as another commenter pointed out , there is reference to it by the ancient greeks . 
  i 'm really sorry that science and history get in the way of your pre-conceived ideas but you 're simply wrong on this topic . 
  who the fuck made this all about drugs ? 
  ptsd is a real disorder that people suffer during war or after extreme trauma . 
  you 're simply wrong about this . 
  in fact , most of the top researchers on ptsd are psych ** ologists ** ( for example , seligman ) who have no want or ability to prescribe drugs . 
  you 're just horribly wrong and your words can hurt people . 
  please fucking stop . 
  wow . 
  the level of denial you 're in is really quite frightening . 
  we 're talking about science here , not your personal opinion . 
  i do n't care , at all , what you think because this is n't a matter of opinion , it 's a matter of science . 
  i 've tried talking to you because this sort of perspective on mental health is dangerous but i 'm going to cut my losses and stop now . 
   `` science '' ... who do you suppose funds that `` science '' just a bunch of guys sitting around doing science for the sake of it ? 
  does that pay the bills ? 
  colleges do , dipstick . 
  i 'm done . 
  you 're officially a loon . 
  you have no grip on reality . 
  please get help . 
  most do n't remember this but a main character in buffy died in the first episode , he may have even been in the opening credits . 
  his career did not have quite the same trajectory as the others . 
  the way the us fetishises `` rights and freedoms '' at the costs of overall wellbeing . 
  in the context of the history it makes sense but it really gets in the way some times . 
  this is a perfect example, 
  ( it 's a himym reference ), 
  erectile dysfunction 6 : it 's okay , we can just cuddle, 
  joss whedon does love meta-humour, 
  because he 's a core character of the episode and in the opening theme, 
  how i met your mother, 
  good call , you 're spot on . 
  it just depends how important it is to you and how it affects other parts of your life . 
  if they 're only okay with bringing up their kids with `` christian values '' and you do n't agree with that , you 've got a problem . 
  if it 's a very small part of both your lives , it does n't matter . 
  well , this is something you need to have a really honest conversation about . 
  can he be happy with your level of involvement ? 
  are you going to be happy to be involved ? 
  is he going to try and convert you ? 
  have you talked about how you 're going to raise your kids ? 
  no it 's not against to rules to say bad things about moderators or other redditors . 
  start with that imnotjesus guy , he 's an asshole .
