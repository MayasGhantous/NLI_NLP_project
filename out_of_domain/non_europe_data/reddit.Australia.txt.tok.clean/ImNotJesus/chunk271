  turn to the person on your left and let them know that notjesus says hi, 
  i do n't really know that this is a scientific question but the answer is that it 's irrelevant . 
  if sarah palin and stephen hawking are discussing physics , their relative intelligence or experience outside of that specific question is irrelevant . 
  all the matters is who the data supports . 
  see if there is a subreddit for your city/local area, 
  a measured and fair response, 
  my dad forgot my birthday this year . 
  i spoke to him about my birthday 3 days earlier . 
  ( see china ), 
  self-loathing while reading reddit, 
  [ mad world - gary jules ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n3n1mlvvc4 ), 
  i was probably going to start masturbating soon , so i 'd really appreciate it . 
  [ not perfect ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgupp1np4o ), 
  i do n't particularly like the original . 
  it 's like it 's a completely different song .

  call the cops, 
  ** you are allowed to ask for anything you want in a relationship ** . 
  they 're allowed to say no to anything they want in a relationship . 
  if he says no , you have to decide whether or not you can stay with him if he smokes this much . 
  or , you make a compromise . 
  you 're ** always ** allowed to ask , you just have to deal with the consequences of what it brings up . 
  adult relationships are about telling the other person what you want/need and making decisions about whether you can give it or live without it . 
  my guess is that it 's somehow due to the whole karmanaut incident . 
  even though it happened in a different subreddit and i was no way involved , whenever there is a `` drama '' with one of the mods , random hate gets thrown at the others . 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/uj5n7/caught_my_neighbor_beating_the_shit_out_of_his_kid/c4vv4bi?context=3 ) . 
  i do n't really mind but there 's your probable explanation . 
  thanks , that 's very sweet of you to say . 
  i 'm not too phased by it . 
  in case you have n't noticed yet , reddit gets incredibly angry at things ... for about 3 days , and then no-one hears about it again . 
  ** witty **, 
  yes , watch lots of comedy , listen to comedy podcasts ( where they talk about how comedy works ) and/or [ the green room ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1546139/ ) . 
  do n't just listen to the punchlines , try to understand how a joke is constructed , look at how expectations are built and then changed . 
  most importantly , practise . 
  i know you 're not trying to be a stand-up comedian but there is a reason people pay to see them tell jokes . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm not trying to say that you should develop a stable of reliable jokes , i 'm saying that if you understand how jokes work , you learn how to manipulate them better . 
  ** interesting **, 
  read , learn , ** listen ** and try to gain experiences . 
  take a position but still be flexible enough to change it when someone else has something to add . 
  learn to look at things from different perspectives , that 's how you have an * interesting * perspective and not just the same as everyone else . 
  when * you * were going through your depression , you got through to the other side because you wanted to . 
  here 's the thing about depression , there 's a part of you that wants to stay there . 
  it 's safe . 
  it stops you being vulnerable . 
  even though it 's a horrible experience , there 's a reason why people do n't get help . 
  they 're scared . 
  at the end of the day , you ca n't make her get treatment . 
  you need to ask yourself this question : `` if she does n't get help , can i live the rest of my life like this ? '', 
  if the answer is no , i think you 've got some thinking to do . 
  nerdist , wtf with marc maron , you made it weird . 
  look at the whole nerdist network , there 's a bunch . 
  also , you can just search for comedians you like on itunes and then see what podcasts regularly pop up . 
  you 'll see quickly that comedians ' brains tend to work in a pretty similar way . 
  they did n't know any different , nor did they have the means to get to other places . 
  in fact , humans almost died out because the conditions were so harsh . 
  how funny and original . 
  well done you !, 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  would she be willing to meditate ? 
  have a look at [ this ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu ) , it 's just as effective as cbt and does n't feel as threatening for some people . 
  get her to do it once a day and it will change a lot . 
  good call , i tried to pick 3 long interviews that were quite different . 
  chris is very easy-going and the interviews are light and fun . 
  marc maron is much deeper and the interviews can be fairly dark but always entertaining . 
  pete holmes ( you made it weird ) is totally different again because he 's generally interviewing his buddies . 
  you feel like you 're listening in on comics chatting over lunch . 
  the american system of tips making up the wage is so , so , so stupid . 
  1 ) it means that servers are at risk of not getting enough pay because their customers are tight/assholes . 
  2 ) servers have to deal with the stress of not knowing how much they 'll make each shift . 
  3 ) it means you ca n't actually reward good service as easily . 
  in australia , if i get bad service/food i wo n't tip at all . 
  if i get good service/food i tip about 10 % ( which is usually split between front of house and kitchen ) . 
  the good staff get rewarded , the bad stuff still make a living wage . 
  the american system is dumb and only takes power away from employees . 
  totally agree . 
  i 'll be ** way ** more efficient for the whole day if i get a proper night sleep . 
  it 's an investment in productivity . 
  you 're also forgetting that it is n't that easy to find new work if your boss starts making life difficult for you ( likely if they 're not paying you proper wages in the first place ) , especially when you ca n't get a reference from your old boss . 
  we 're just loading the system to advantage assholes by letting them not pay tips and pay staff less than minimum wage . 
  it 's just silly when it 's ** so easy ** to just have a real minimum wage . 
  if you do n't want them , that just makes a lot of sense . 
  nothing worse than people who get married and are divided on the huge issues . 
  knowing someone who got malaria three times as a kid , fuck mosquitos . 
  i never said the system is the worst thing in the world , which is what you seem to be arguing against , i think it 's stupid and unnecessary , making life harder for the employees . 
  that 's objectively true , even if there are some methods of resolution .

  justin bieber because i hate obviously talented people who make music for a different demographic . 
  all art should be directed towards me and me alone . 
  edit : real answer - carlos mencia because he 's a joke-stealing asshole . 
  masturbated , played diablo , now at work . 
  speak to a psychologist . 
  that whether you ** lose a limb ** or ** win the lottery ** , you 'll return to your base level of happiness after only a year . 
  that 's my point , it 's not .
