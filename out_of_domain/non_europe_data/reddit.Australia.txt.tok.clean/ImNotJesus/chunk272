  who cares ? 
  not all art has to reach some lofty expectation . 
  you 've never enjoyed a tv show that was n't as well made as the sopranos ? 
  if people enjoy it , it serves a purpose . 
  there are obviously other factors but on average , yes . 
  watch [ this ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ), 
  edit : the whole area is called affective forecasting and it 's fascinating . 
  the tl ; dr of it all is that we over-estimate how sad/happy things will make us or how quickly we adjust to our new situation . 
  raped a kitten, 
  at least i_rape_cats waited until they were of legal age . 
  karmanaut does n't even do that, 
  art :, 
  the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination , typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture , ... : `` the art of the renaissance '', 
  works produced by such skill and imagination . 
  he uses skill , imagination and creativity . 
  it 's not designed for * you * and * you * could n't do what he does . 
  he is n't a hack , he just does n't appeal to * you * . 
  then you 're letting your bias get in the way . 
  if you do n't think he 's genuinely talented , you 're deluding yourself . 
  i find his music boring , that does n't mean he is n't ** very ** talented . 
  go do what he does . 
  go on . 
  if it 's that easy and talent-free , you could be a millionaire in a few weeks !, 
  if you do n't think that all of those artists have music talent , you 're an idiot . 
  it 's one thing to say that they do n't appeal to you or that they only appeal to a lowest common denominator but to say that they have no talent is absurd and shows so much bias it should disqualify you from the discussion . 
  this is n't an appropriate forum for medical discussions and i 'll be forced to remove it if it starts to happen . 
  it 's impossible to verify people 's qualifications and if she has any concerns about the diagnosis , she should be seeking a second opinion and not the opinions of anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  here 's the thing about asking for medical advice on the internet . 
  anyone sufficiently qualified will know that giving medical advice over the internet is stupid . 
  that only leaves people who have no idea what they 're talking about giving advice . 
  edit : after discussing it further below , i now realise this is a question of the post 's validity because it originally contained a link to a band on youtube . 
  let me be clear , if a post is ever soliciting donations or clearly using their post as free advertising , ** message the moderators immediately ** . 
  the same thing goes for personal information being posted . 
  we have 0 tolerance for this sort of thing and the user will be banned . 
  as much as i hate to say it , i do n't think it could ever live up to our expectations . 
  to be clear , you were asking for proof that she is indeed dying of cancer ? 
   leave no stone unturned, 
  this does n't mean going to quacks who promise cancer cures . 
  leave no ( real medicine ) stone unturned . 
  it does currently say :, 
   please use the search in the sidebar . 
  somebody may have already posted your question !, 
  although , i 'm certain it 's never stopped anyone . 
  how do you propose we implement this ? 
  i do n't understand what it would look like . 
  i follow now . 
  it 's probably worth noting though that the link has been removed . 
  if a paypal gets posted at any stage , please immediately ** message ** the moderators and tell us . 
  i 'll remove it instantly . 
  if it does , please message the moderators and i 'll remove it instantly . 
  it can be editted indefinitely . 
  fur elise, 
  similarly , saying the age of the universe is 10,000 is the same level of error as saying that the distance of the united states from side to side is 8 yards . 
  i rekn i 've got the strongest least known/karma ratio of anyone . 
  i 'm # 15 overall . 
  are you asking why you ca n't ask for medical advice ? 
  if so , the answer is that it 's ** very ** dangerous . 
  you 'll have plenty of other chances to party , you wo n't ever get a better chance to study .

  i 'm still behind a guy that has only used reddit twice ever ** and ** for some reason i do n't show up on karmawhores.net, 
  haha thanks i guess . 
  i almost exclusively post in askreddit so that 's probably why . 
  huh ? 
  according to ? 
  it 's like 35k karma behind though . 
  how do i get it to update ? 
  i 've been getting it exponentially faster recently but that 's a few weeks out of date . 
  step 1 . 
  be awesome, 
  step 2 . 
  post awesomely . 
  step 3 . 
  step 4 . 
  i just need a tub of ice-cream and a spoon . 
  25 % of the way there !, 
  honestly , i do n't think i have a trick . 
  i try to find posts that are likely to hit the frontpage but that 's partly just because i get sick of writing out long answers and 4 people ever reading it . 
  90 % of my time is in the new queue but i also scan the askreddit frontpage to see posts that are < 2 hours old and have not too many comments . 
  i shat the bed once . 
  apparently , you should n't take an incredibly strong laxative ( the kind that you take with dinner and it 's supposed to make you go the next morning but really wakes you up at 3am to spout like a fire hydrant ) and then go to sleep really , really stoned . 
  i woke up mid-explosion . 
  oh , i should add that i still lived with my parents and i was taking it because i had n't been in about 3/4 days so it was n't a small amount either . 
  say no . 
  also , if he 's bored after only 5 months , that 's kind of worrying . 
  is the sex good ? 
  are you mixing things up ? 
  actually the whole thing sounds kind of fishy . 
  either he 's already cheating , has some warped views about what he * should want * or the sex is terrible .

  well that 's clearly your bigger issue . 
  have you talked to him about him not wanting sex very often ? 
  yeah , he 's either already cheating or has some serious emotional issues around sex . 
  thanks, 
  having emotional issues ! = being upset a lot . 
  in fact , having little understanding/experience of his own emotions could very well be a part of it .
