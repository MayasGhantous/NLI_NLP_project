  what you need to do is sit down with him ( when both of you are calm/relaxed ) and ask about what he does/doesn ' t like in regards to sex . 
  ask about his history and what he wants from you . 
  lastly , tell him feel like he has a small appetite and ask if this is normal for him . 
  downvotes . 
  floods and floods of downvotes . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/ulp3a/modpost_on_pancreatic_cancer_reporting_and_the/ ), 
  good question . 
  i personally take a pretty hard-line view on anything that is essentially asking for advice . 
  however , if the topic is , let 's say , discussing people 's experiences of having a medical disorder , that can probably slide . 
  for example , `` i have this lump , what should i do ? '', 
  is n't okay but `` do you have a medical condition that affects your daily life ? '', 
  would be okay . 
  edit : better example . 
  my guess would be the former but there 's no real way to know . 
  i think you have my confused with someone else . 
  do n't worry , happens all the time . 
  just doin my job sir , * tips hat *, 
  as i typed that , i mimed tipping my own hat . 
  i do n't know why i did this and am now embarrassed . 
  i certainly do n't think i 'm special for being a mod , i just really like askreddit and want to help improve it as much as i can . 
  i * do * think i 'm special for being handsome , my mom regularly says so . 
  yeah , i 'm not actually wearing a hat . 
  i 'm also at work . 
  yup , there 's a whole bunch of us . 
  you can see a list on the right hand side , half way down the page . 
  it 's not really a problem in askreddit but i really wish a lot more people read this one from the ** do n't ** section :, 
   complain about reposts . 
  just because you have seen it before does n't mean everyone has . 
  votes indicate the popularity of a post , so just vote . 
  keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint ; it is information . 
  votes indicate how the community values information , so just vote, 
  just in case anyone is wondering , thanking me is definitely adding to the discussion and you should be upvoted accordingly !, 
  are you saying that the reason you accused me of thinking i 'm `` special '' for being a moderator is my ( over ) use of personal pronouns ? 
  depends on the topic . 
  if it 's health/legal advice , then no . 
  if it 's relationship advice , i have no problem with it . 
  i guess the line is whether or not the advice is clearly acting as a replacement for professional advice . 
  good question . 
  i think that it depends on whether it will help ** generate discussion ** or not . 
   i hate jews, 
  does nothing to generate discussion . 
  well , that 's legal advice and should n't be on askreddit . 
  the same as if someone asked `` i think my partner gave me an std , what do i do ? '', 
  go the the fucking doctor is what you do . 
  it 's not just a chance , if it 's on the frontpage ** a lot ** of people have n't seen it . 
  the op deleted their account as soon as i asked them to remove the youtube link . 
  clearly , their only motivation was sharing the youtube link . 
  sorry if i was unclear in my explanation . 
  exactly . 
  some posts get to the frontpage semi-regularly and often have different answers . 
  this does n't include `` which cancelled tv show do you want to come back '' . 
  it 's always firefly and arrested development . 
  always . 
  the youtube link was fairly unrelated to the post and was n't at all necessary . 
  when the youtube link was put back , i asked op to remove it , just to avoid any bigger issues . 
  if op had any major issues with that or wanted to explain why it was relevant , i would 've gladly heard it but i was fairly sceptical . 
  anyway , op deleted their account , essentially admitting it was a scam . 
  a youtube video . 
  spot on , that was the first clue . 
  the second was how unnecessary the youtube link was to the story . 
  last hint was that she ( or he ) said she was going to bed and and then 2 hours later the youtube video reappeared because of `` lots of requests '' for it . 
  it smelled fishy which is why i messaged her . 
  ps : you double posted by mistake so i removed your other one . 
  because goats rarely wait long enough for you to put on protection . 
  you can put advertising on videos and make money . 
  most likely though it was just a way to get attention for op 's band . 
  a whole bunch of mods were added a few months ago now . 
  i 've also been much more active since then . 
  also , you probably saw me around but just did n't recognise my name . 
  the cocktails are a lie . 
  `` probably is n't jesus '' ? 
  thanks pal ,, 
  protip : if you want the text on a new line you need to leave a line gap in between . 
  yup and it 's why sometimes the mods have to be assholes . 
  the problem with that is people mis-use the report function and we would be inundated . 
  people use it like a `` super downvote '' or something . 
  messaging us is the quickest way to get our attention when it 's an urgent case . 
  and that 's why we have a blanket ban on charity drives etc. 
  thank you comrade . 
  i expect you to update that over time and let me know where i 'm at . 
  i 've posted about this a few times on reddit but it gets met with a flood of downvotes when i do :, 
  the overwhelming consensus in the psychological community is that the use of corporal punishment by parents is n't just a very poor behaviour modification strategy ( it 's met with immediate compliance but ** does n't ** change long-term behaviour ) , it also has many negative outcomes for the child such as increased aggression and increases likelihood of developing a mental illness . 
  [ here is a link to the largest meta-analysis on the topic ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doilanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.539 ) . 
  tl ; dr the science says , do n't hit your kids . 
  i agree ** but ** i think that the illusion of free will and `` real '' free will are functionally identical . 
  i do n't know if i 'd say a license but i wish there were mandatory parenting classes that was based on the best psychology/medical research . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  it 's worth remembering that the ** vast ** majority of people are caring people . 
  in fact , in that thread there was an out-pour of well-wishing , positive advice and offers of support . 
  in fact , if people overall were n't so caring , that thread never would 've reached the frontpage . 
  do n't let one bad person spoil your view of society as a whole . 
  til that i 'm less evolved . 
  makes sense , i guess . 
  i could n't disagree more . 
  sure there 's some crap on here but our access to information is unparalleled . 
  i 've taken courses from harvard , yale and berkeley , all from the convenience of my own pocket . 
  reports do n't get ignored , they just do n't get seen as quickly . 
  they ** all ** get seen though . 
  overall , we do n't want to discourage reporting . 
  i 'd rather have a whole bunch of bad reports than none at all .
