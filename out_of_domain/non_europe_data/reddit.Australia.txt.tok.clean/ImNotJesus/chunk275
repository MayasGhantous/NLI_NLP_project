   shitty, 
  teehee i get it, 
  i really do n't want to hear the story of cotton eye joe then, 
  not being hispanic myself , i 'm glad you did n't think i was racist , thank you . 
  okay , here 's the thing pal , you ca n't control your thoughts/emotions . 
  what you can control is ** how you react to them ** . 
  there is nothing wrong with having biases , in fact , being aware of them is good . 
  what * is * wrong , is acting on the biases . 
  try to work out why you believe the things you do and reality test them . 
  how does he hide that ? 
  does he have no contact with his son ? 
  what a giant asshole . 
  sorry , i 'm one of the few that do n't , mine ends in man though which is fairly common for german ancestry . 
  i 'm pretty sure that she can tell you have no job . 
  sorry , i feel dirty after that, 
  my all-time favourite moment :, 
   ... mr. connery . . the category was numbers , and you wrote . . [ shows his screen ] . . a letter v. well , i tell you what , my friend - v is a roman numeral , so despite your best efforts , you answered correctly . 
  let 's see what you wagered . . [ wager is revealed to use the v as part of a k in `` suck it trebek '' ] `` suck it trebek '' . 
  i 'm signing up next time i donate plasma ( probably next week sometime ) . 
  i 'm a bit terrified of the prospect but it 's an incredible gift . 
  i 'm not sure , sorry . 
  you 'd have to check with your local blood bank . 
  the basis of cbt ( cognitive behavioural therapy - the most common type of psychotherapy ) is a combination of that , and the fact that if you frequently challenge your thoughts , you can change them over time . 
  here 's a common example : my friend cancels lunch with me . 
  so , as a result , i make all sorts of conclusions . 
  `` they do n't really want to see me '' , `` they 're seeing someone they like more '' , `` no-one wants to be my friend '' etc. 
  now , the reality is that it 's almost certain that something else just came up and it means almost nothing but these * maladaptive thought processes * have a real effect on you . 
  if you were doing cbt , you would then take all of these thoughts and * reality test * them . 
  so , in this case , something happens and op might have thoughts about black people . 
  he needs to test those thoughts to see if they objectively conform to reality . 
  if he keeps proving them wrong , they 'll change over time . 
  i had to explain what the holocaust was the a girl at my old job . 
  she was 22 at the time . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/jenny_mccarthy_body_count/home.html ), 
  that depends . 
  is it because you do n't think it 's worth it and you 're happy to risk getting the flu or is it because you think the government is using it to control your mind and/or it will give you autism ? 
  doctors in australia have started refusing to see kids that are n't vaccinated because it 's a risk to the other patients . 
  honestly , i think it should be considered child abuse , it 's that reckless . 
  i have a shortcut for / r/asksocialscience + / r/askscience + / r/explainlikeimfive + / r/askculinary on res . 
  i love it . 
  i get so many messages like `` why do i have you tagged as having goat aids ? '', 
  wow ... that 's just ... wow . 
  was n't a girlfriend but the first girl i ever kissed started cutting herself and and showing me at school . 
  she told me that she 'd kill herself if i did n't become her boyfriend . 
  pusillanimous because it 's awesome sounding . 
  thanks , pal, 
  in a panic i picked up a kayak oar ( do n't ask why there was one in my bedroom ) . 
  it 's worth noting that i have thin hallways and at best i would 've been able to poke the intruder with the end of it . 
  it 's regularly sung [ in english ] ( http://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/frank+sinatra/girl+from+ipanema+the_10121534.html ), 
  there are some pretty awesome jazz english versions . 
  meditation . 
  dozens of clinical studies show that it drastically reduces stress . 
  did we just become best friends ? 
  if you 're financially able , you could always donate some money to the service that does it in your country . 
  i 'll agree with that . 
  prison ? 
  recent studies have shown that regular meditation is pretty comparable to prozac in reducing anxiety . 
  you do amazing work over there . 
  the unsung heroes of reddit, 
  is this a hypothetical question or are you looking to give away money ? 
  sorry , pal . 
  this is n't an appropriate subreddit for that . 
  every time . 
  do we have to do this every time ? 
  i 'm going to have this in my head all night now . 
  it 's nonsensical to think that there 's only one person out there that can make you happy . 
  love is n't about a perfect match , it 's about being flexible and sacrificing and trying to make the best out of an imperfect situation . 
  if love was perfect , it would be * boring * . 
  let [ tim minchin ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kynikjrwqdi ) explain it to you . 
  love and attraction is n't ** anywhere near ** that simple . 
  some girls love to be swept off their feet , others do n't . 
  it 's certainly not the only factor though . 
  most importantly , do n't let anyone convince you that you have to be `` alpha '' , it 's bullshit . 
  just be who you are and the girl who likes that person is the one you want to be with anyway . 
  [ please no ] ( http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loz1rhnaen1qzado8o3_250.gif ), 
  it 's better this way . 
  simple factors like that ca n't last for decades . 
  would you want to be 20 years from now and relying on sweeping her off her feet every day ? 
  oh , well in that case , it is real . 
  i 'd gladly sacrifice my own happiness for my partner 's . 
  i do n't know . 
  creepy, 
  if it 's burning , that 's an iron . 
  self-posts do n't receive karma, 
  one definitely does move back from north korea, 
  sorry , misread . 
  in that case , it 's probably because you 're counting the vote you give yourself automatically . 
  that does n't count to your total . 
  i do n't believe in love at first sight . 
  i think anyone who has been in love knows that love at first sight is just attraction . 
  real love takes compromise and time and being there for someone in the hard times . 
  i knew i was in love in a quiet moment on the coach with my so . 
  it was n't anything in particular , i just had a moment of clarity . 
  it sounds like these are things to talk through with a psych ** ologist ** . 
  here are 3 very easy intermediate steps i want you to take :, 
  i want you to promise to go for a walk every day . 
  even if it 's a 2 minute walk up and down your street , promise me you 'll go on one every day . 
  i want you to try and get into good regular sleep/eating habits . 
  3 meals a day , no snacks and no crazy late nights . 
  i want you to meditate once a day .
