  it could be as little as 3 minutes . 
  you can find more information [ here ] ( http://www.marc.edu ) from ucla 's mindfulness research centre and also some guided meditations to get you going . 
  if you have any problems or need more support , feel free to pm me any time . 
  agreed . 
  she 's so useful . 
  why did i click that ?? 
  why ?? 
  i knew what it was going to be . 
  i had the stereotypical evil step-mom . 
  she gave me a really fucked up attitude around food ( would cook things i did n't eat and then not allow me to leave the table until i ate it all ) . 
  anyway , the worst was when she basically force-fed me grapes because i did n't eat enough fruit . 
  i vomited violently and ca n't stand the sight of them now . 
  yes , but tonight i could quit . 
  no matter what you do you 'll wake up ugly tomorrow . 
  [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ), 
  i 'm also in melbourne and mine is working fine . 
  i work in a job where i make reports about incidents that happen in hospitals . 
  my stories are n't funny as much as they 're ... uh ... terrifying . 
  instead , enjoy having an orangered for the next 3 days combined with random , unexplainable anger in your inbox . 
  you 'll see , you 'll get some messages like `` fuck you , you ca n't give me life tips , they 're bullshit anyway '' but with much worse grammar and more vitriol . 
  and novelty account = free karma, 
  i passed you during your sabbatical . 
  you 'll leap frog me in no time though . 
  i ca n't work that out . 
  for some reason it randomly stopped updating my karma on may 22nd which is just before i started passing a bunch of people , it 's like 30k behind . 
  imo it was karmanaut 's fault . 
  i approved it . 
  other mods might overrule me but normally updates are fine . 
  2 years later * is * stretching it a bit though haha, 
  i do n't know who to contact , it does n't say who runs the site or any way to let people know about errors . 
  it 's not the end of the world but it 's just really bizarre . 
  i should be # 14 . 
  i passed a guy who has only used reddit twice yesterday, 
  me too !, 
  it started a life-long love affair with billiards . 
  hey pal, 
  here 's the biggest mistake people make . 
  you do n't ** get ** someone to like you . 
  you act like yourself and if you 're ** compatible ** she 'll like you too . 
  be a good person who wants to get to know her better and do n't act like everything you 're doing is an attempt to touch her vagina . 
  you can make a new one , ca n't change that one . 
  most effort came from presenting an argument that corporal punishment is a bad parenting technique according to the research . 
  the effort was n't the original post , it was the several hundred angry replies that i got . 
  why would i ban you for that ? 
  i do n't really mind if you do n't care about karma . 
  it certainly is n't * that * important to me but i 'd be lying if i said that having so many people think what i have to say is funny/interesting is n't nice . 
  that they 're , on average , just a little bit crazier . 
  we both spend entirely too much time on reddit as it is . 
  do you really think one person could manage both of these accounts ? 
  spot on, 
  lol i do n't buy it, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/pedophilia.html ), 
   and the lord spake unto moses , saying , avenge the children of israel of the midianites ... and they warred against the midianites , as the lord commanded moses ; and they slew all the males ... and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives , and their little ones ... and moses was wroth with the officers ... and moses said unto them , have ye saved all the women alive ? 
  ... now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him . 
  but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves . 
  ** numbers 31:1 -18 **, 
   when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it ... and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword : but the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself . 
  ** deuteronomy 20:10 -14 **, 
   how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ? 
  ... and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest , and commanded them , saying , go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children . 
  and this is the thing that ye shall do , ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man . 
  and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh . 
  ** judges 21:7 -11 **, 
   go and lie in wait in the vineyards ; and see , and , behold , if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances , then come ye out of the vineyards , and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh ... and the children of benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught . 
  ** judges 21:20 -23 **, 
  and, 
   if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant ... 
  if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed ... 
  if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .

  [ zeno 's paradoxes are the best ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeno's_paradoxes ), 
  let 's say you have 100 points of energy to use . 
  a whole bunch of different factors will cause you to use more/less energy and gain/lose energy . 
  food/drinks will add energy , activities will reduce them . 
  your body tries to conserve that energy because it needs it to survive . 
  energy drinks `` trick '' your body into using more energy than it wants to with drugs like caffeine . 
  this is very useful if you need more energy for a short period but it throws off your body 's system for making sure it does n't run too low . 
  when it realises you 're now lower on energy than you should be , it tries to stop you from doing even * more * things by making you very tired .

  meditation . 
  studies have shown it has incredible mental and physical health benefits . 
  sorry , bit slow today . 
  12 minutes late on the ban, 
  thanks , 
  i think the issue here is n't so much the requirement she 's giving you , it 's more that you need to get the fuck away from this crazy woman . 
  if this is her barrier for entry , you need to run . 
  irrespective of the part of your body , you should ** never ** irreparably change a part of your body for someone you just met . 
  would you get a giant tattoo of her face on your back ? 
   that 's why people get it done when they are so young . 
  because no man would ever consent to that,
