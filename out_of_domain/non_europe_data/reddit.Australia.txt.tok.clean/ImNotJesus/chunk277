  i 'm officially calling troll . 
  he 's a pretty angry guy ... 
  i never made the connection until now . 
  [ link to original paper ] ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/05/28/rspb.2012.0827 ), 
  we do n't have it in australia so i 'm not sure what 's in it , sorry . 
  i ca n't log off reddit to do any fucking study, 
  thanks pal, 
  honestly , i just find them hilarious . 
  made her see the school counsellor, 
  a lot of people have weird tags of me . 
  there 's a few bestiality ones , a few about upvotes , a couple of goat aids and then a few more about my penis working just fine . 
  for anyone who does n't know all of the details , andrew got far more screwed out of the incident than anyone else did . 
  the fact that he 's still telling people to give karmanaut a break tells you something . 
  ps : the whole thing was ** never ** about karma , it was about a mod making a bad decision ( rashly ) and then not being able to admit making a mistake and saying sorry . 
  the issue was arrogance but it was n't arrogance around karma . 
  it 's a fake . 
  ( no really , click on his name , i was n't making a joke ), 
  i 'm still standing, 
  yeah yeah yeah, 
  ( at work , ca n't click ), 
  glad i did n't click then, 
  if they 're affecting your life , talking to a psychologist . 
  if they 're not majorly affecting you , learn to meditate . 
  creating a reddit account . 
  it 's all blurry before that . 
  why do any of us care ? 
  in most of those cases it 's probably false memory anyway . 
  if you 're genuinely interested in learning more about neuroscience , there * are * a bunch of itunesu courses online you can do for free . 
  i 've done yale , berkeley and harvard courses all from the comfort of my own pocket . 
  well ... this did n't take long to turn dark . 
  edit : i have to know ... did it work ? 
  a friend used to give me shit for getting better grades than me so i showed him reddit . 
  now who 's laughing . 
  story ? 
  you ca n't just `` cheer someone up '' who is grieving , nor should you want to . 
  that 's you putting your anxiety onto them . 
  allow her to grieve and provide support . 
  she 'll get through it in her own time and it 's important to go through the process . 
  i corrected someone 's grammar publicly instead of telling them in pm once . 
  okay , here 's the deal . 
  you ca n't fix any of this , you 're not qualified to even try . 
  your job is to support your friend . 
  you support him by being there for him and letting him talk . 
  do not try to fix how he feels , do not try to tell him to not feel anything . 
  allow him to go through his own process and let him know you 'll do whatever he needs . 
  you ca n't do more than that and you should n't try . 
  please do n't do this . 
  i understand that you had a hard experience smiley but it 's not drakob 's place to try and intervene with the dad . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  you 're welcome to your opinion . 
  i think it was both badly handled and a poor decision but i do see where he was coming from . 
  no sir/ma ` am . 
  get out . 
  get out while you still can . 
  this is about 10x more rant than question . 
  try / r/rant or / r/self, 
  if someone read through all of my comments and took my jokes seriously , i 'd probably be up for a life sentence . 
  as a 25 year old guy , i can look at the baby for about 4x as long if my so is there with me . 
  if not , i get weird looks ** very ** quickly . 
  i love watching little kids trying to work out a problem . 
  watching their brain tick and seeing them try to discover how the world works is enthralling . 
  go to the doctor ? 
  i count that as one loss and one win . 
  if that 's what your girlfriend is like , you just won the fucking lottery getting rid of her . 
  well fuck me sideways with a hammer \u2122 . 
  i 'm still not sure how one is fucked sideways but it does n't stop me saying it . 
  he said yo ** lo ** not yo ** da **, 
  i did and got weird looks from my co-workers . 
  / r/doesanybodyelse, 
  no yes/no answer questions . 
  daes are yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  say what you want but the first half a dozen times you heard it , it was awesome . 
  i said calm down, 
  it 's not illegal because of the harm in viewing it , it 's illegal because a child ca n't consent . 
  i do n't know the video itself , i was answering to snuff in general . 
  if that 's the case there are obviously different legal issues and i would n't be surprised if the makers could get into trouble . 
  however , i do n't see why this is , * at all * , an either/or thing . 
  the most enraging part, 
   dr hall also questioned the idea espoused by dr gawler that those with '' passively subservient '' and '' nice '' personalities were more likely to get cancer , saying without any evidence to support it , it was '' cruel and unjustified '' to suggest people 's personalities were faulty and needed to change . 
  this post is about to hit the front page , where 's trapped_in_reddit 's comment ? 
  you 're english teacher probably feels the same way . 
  my prediction is that he piggybacks a top 3 comment within the next 5 minutes ... let 's watch . 
  i 'm playing the karmanaut strategy . 
  worstanswerpossible is pretty close to me in karma ... 
  i think someone is itching for an askreddit ban . 
  as always ... terrible comeback . 
  terrible . 
  if you 're interviewing an oncologist about cancer , then yes . 
  i do n't really care what a guy who spent 3 years studying journalism has to say about cancer , in that case his job is to get the information out of the expert , not give his own uneducated opinion . 
  unacceptable , pal, 
  if you 've done any reading on the social psychology of groups , this is very much the norm for any group . 
  the poles always become the most vocal . 
  edit : thought i should explain . 
  [ group polarisation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group_polarization ) causes the most extreme views to come out . 
  these views become the new norm ( they 're upvoted/accepted by the group ) , causing the next view to become slightly more extreme . 
  two really annoy me :, 
  1 ) how quickly everyone rushes to lynch-mob status . 
  the perfect example is the recent karmanaut incident .
