  frankly , the whole situation was about karmanaut making a rash decision on / r/iama and then being too stubborn to admit that he was wrong . 
  the karma stuff was beyond ludicrous . 
  but , within moments , the story spread like wildfire becoming much more than it was . 
  2 ) reddit likes to think it 's ** much ** more enlightened than it is . 
  this is often true of generally liberal groups ( i say this as a die-hard liberal ) . 
  there 's a tendency to think of conservatives as stuck in the mud and unable to change their views but this happens on reddit ** heaps ** . 
  for example , i 've ( on several occasions now ) presented long , scientifically backed arguments against parents using corporal punishment on children but as soon as it 's an issue redditors believe theyr ' e right in , the `` love of science '' that gets lauded on here goes out the window . 
  this is true , i actually wrote my thesis on it . 
  great point sweetcheeks . 
  i think / r/politics is at least as much of a circlejerk as / r/atheism is , which actually makes it much , much worse . 
  / r/politics , ** should n't ** be a circlejerk , it does n't assume a position . 
  / r/atheism is ** about atheism ** so of course they 're going to have a certain view . 
  i 'm not saying that parts of it are n't really immature but i think / r/politics has ** a lot ** more to answer for . 
  stole my life, 
  just a very naughty boy, 
  anything by guy ritchie, 
  that 's like telling the drug-addled junkie off for deciding to move into a crack den when already homeless . 
  i think that monogamy is n't for everyone . 
  it offers some advantages and some disadvantages . 
  there 's no right/wrong answer , it 's just whatever suits the couple . 
  i have no will/desire to sleep with anyone besides my girlfriend , i just do n't . 
  to us , monogamy is very important . 
  to other couples , it 's not . 
  it 's not a hang-up or one of us being `` wrong '' , couples just work differently . 
  if it 's causing you distress , i recommend talking to a counsellor/psychologist about it . 
  moderate kitten killers over extremist rationalists ? 
  meth, 
  nooooooooo ^ ooooooooo ^ oooooooooooooo ^ oooooooooooo ^ ooooooooooo, 
  potentially but probably not . 
  unless you 're with a girl you 've been with for a while ( and trust ** a lot ** ) you should ** always ** use a rubber , even if she says she 's on birth control . 
  my depression was the best thing that ever happened to me . 
  it put me in a position where i had to tear myself down and build myself back up again . 
  it was a horrible experience but i 'm happier than i 've ever been and i would n't be here if it were n't for that experience . 
  it 's okay , you made a mistake but let 's just only make this mistake once okay ? 
  buy some condoms asap and put one in your wallet , the rest hidden in your bedroom . 
  now you 're always prepared . 
  do n't rely on your `` i 'm about to have sex '' brain to make the right decision .

  wait till the doctor appt . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) is the biggest meta-analysis on the topic . 
  tl ; dr hitting kids is ineffective ( does n't create long-term behaviour change ) and has a lot of negative outcomes including increased aggression , poorer relationship with the parent and a higher likelihood of mental illness . 
  my friend is doing his phd in food science at the moment , i was blown away by the number of lives saved every year by gm food . 
  edit : to be clear , gm food is brilliant . 
  some of the companies that use it are evil . 
  the problem is that we need better regulation that is ** informed by the science ** . 
  this is a science issue , not a political one . 
  they frown on this sort of question unfortunately . 
  they do something like this once a week but you need to * ask * specific questions . 
  on pharmaceuticals :, 
  * they 're all just a way for doctors/big pharma to make money, 
  * there are natural ways to heal our body/alternative medicine is just more `` natural '' . 
  much . 
  anger . 
  edit : given the context i thought this was clear - i was being sarcastic . 
  i was being sarcastic on all 3 . 
  spot on . 
  i 'll add one about this , well said . 
  this may be a myth but i heard that the only place you ** ca n't ** catch a cold is antarctica and that 's because it 's too cold for the virus to exist outside of the body . 
  i used bipolar since i 've heard that a few times . 
  my only hope is that the people who think that , think the same about gravity and try to jump off a roof . 
  haha i do n't know if i 'd call it concise but i love teaching people about psychology so this was truly a pleasure . 
  i think that less corporal punishment is less bad . 
  but , i 'd be lying if i said that i support using any . 
  i 'm not here to tell anyone how to parent though , i 'm just trying to present the science . 
  my personal belief though is that it 's still harmful . 
  this is the truth . 
  our common ancestor would appear more `` ape-like '' to us but they 're different from modern monkey . 
  of course , like with anything there are consumers/professionals who take things to extremes . 
  this is n't good but it 's also not representative of the product itself . 
  apples are good for you . 
  eating apples for every meal is n't . 
  sure . 
  i can give you the two sentence answer or the 2 page answer on this one . 
  the short answer is that there is a feedback loop between thoughts/emotions . 
  what we think affects how we feel and what we feel affects what we think . 
  different types of talk therapy will use different methods to either change how we think , how we feel or how we react to those thoughts/feelings as a way of disrupting whatever loop is causing the dysfunction . 
  of course , this depends on the type of disorder and the type of therapy . 
  if you want the longer answer i can explain it further . 
  i meant outside . 
  glad i passed your peer-review , 
  also , meditation allows you to stay more calm when emotional , giving you better awareness of what 's going on . 
  thanks pal, 
  in addition to what naricssusiii said , you can also produce crops that have a nutrient they would n't normally have . 
  for example , my friend works in gm rice that delivers nutrients to 3rd world countries where they 're normally deficient . 
  interesting . 
  til, 
  my sister was giving me a speech about being worried about chemicals . 
  i chuckled as she took a drink of her h2o . 
  it 's a wonderful pick-me-up, 
  added . 
  thank you !, 
  of course homeopathy works . 
  that 's why we buried bin laden at sea ... to cure terrorism . 
  no such thing as what ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motivated_reasoning ) . 
  it 's easier to believe that corporal punishment works than your parents fucked up . 
  ooo good one , thanks . 
  any particular area you 're interested in or just a good general psych book ? 
  i 'm not sure , sorry . 
  i have n't heard that stat .
