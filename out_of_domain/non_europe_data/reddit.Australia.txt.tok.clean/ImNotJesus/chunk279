  editted to reflect that . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'll add that in 5 minutes . 
  that 's because you 're not real psych ( kidding ! ), 
  sorry , pal . 
  much appreciated, 
  if you want to give me a 1/2 sentence definition i 'll change my post since you know much more about the field than i. 
  really ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  i 'm australian . 
  anything in particular you 're interested in and what 's your level of knowledge ? 
  shhh do n't tell them that one . 
  ~ ~ never heard of it , sounds like bs but i ca n't be sure . ~ ~, 
  much appreciated . 
  berkeley have a clinical psych course . 
  i have n't tried it but i 'd start there . 
  you 'll learn about mental illness and treatment . 
  otherwise , there * are * manuals you can get off amazon that are written by psychologists , designed to teach you how to use cbt on yourself . 
  there 's some really important stuff in psychoanalysis but hardcore psychoanalysis is bullshit . 
  you got ta take the real stuff ( reaction formation , attachment theory etc. ), 
  and pull it out from the bunk . 
  itunesu, 
  i gave a link there for meditation . 
  good hypnotherapy is basically guided meditation so it * can * be effective but there are quacks out there . 
  yes , you can learn to use cbt/act on yourself , there are some good books out there . 
  i like [ this ] ( http://www.actmindfully.com.au/bookshop.asp ) for act . 
  you can find cbt stuff on amazon . 
  dbt is really good , it 's basically a composite . 
  i actually just got a job working with autistic kids 2 nights ago . 
  excited for my training . 
  it would n't be fair on you for me to try and diagnose you over the internet . 
  it would n't hurt to make one appointment with a psychologist and talk about your concerns . 
  deepak chopra is a fucking quack . 
  do n't try to be her therapist , just be her friend . 
  encourage her to do little things like exercise/meditation and get her socialising ** if she 's comfortable ** . 
  do n't try to fix her . 
  make it again . 
  best case scenario , you get help . 
  worst case scenario , ( s ) he tells you that you do n't need help and your mind is clearer . 
  i get that and it 's hard to be passive but it 's what she needs . 
  a moment of bravery is all you need . 
  you can do it . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's something you should talk to your psychologist/psychiatrist about . 
  it would be improper for me to comment on your medication . 
  fourth year student . 
  not a problem, 
  i like mindfulness ( see the link for some guided meditations ) and i also like yoga nidra ( google ucla yoga nidra ) . 
  hard to say . 
  i certainly would n't push the conversation in one way or another * too much * because you want her to feel safe to communicate . 
  i apologise if i gave you the impression that i was saying that you should never let your child cry . 
  i certainly did n't mean to and my attempt to cover many topics betrayed me . 
  i 'm not trying to make a sweeping statement . 
  i 'm talking about the parents ( and yes they do exist ) that let their week old baby cry at night because they do n't want to teach it bad habits . 
  watch the dan gilbert video , do n't believe me . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  i 'll read up on it now . 
  i had n't heard of it but if it 's on happiness and dan gilbert recommends it , i say it 's got ta be good . 
  you will one day . 
  stick with the treatment . 
  you ca n't ? 
  you took the wrong classes , pal . 
  i taught my mother how to meditate to help her panic attacks . 
  the big thing that i 'm sure you 'll know is that panic feed off itself . 
  you notice the panic and it makes you more panicked . 
  what learning mindfulness will do , is allow you to shift your focus and let the sensations pass . 
  [ university of auckland ] ( http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011/subject-rankings/life-sciences/psychology ) is ranked 27 in the world for psych . 
  not bad . 
  psych is really split into academic/applied . 
  you can research/teach or you can practise as a therapist/consultant, 
  i like you too pal, 
  why do you keep talking to me . 
  i do n't understand, 
  good call , i 'll add it . 
  sorry pal, 
  preaching to the choir here . 
  any specifics you would like me to change ? 
  they are n't trained in psychology , it 's different . 
  your loss pal, 
  generally speaking , dbt is considered the best treatment for borderline . 
  biggest thing you can do for yourself if you ca n't afford care right now is start meditating . 
  i do n't consider books written by psychologists to be in the same category . 
  they 're education books , imo . 
  you do teach them that , but you also teach them that the world is a scary unpredictable place . 
  they ** will ** stop crying but you 're also doing damage . 
  do n't worry about that . 
  just do breathing meditation . 
  it trains your brains and thickens your prefrontal cortex and reduces arousal ( arousal in the clinical sense , not sexual arousal ) . 
  your thanks is enough . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean sorry . 
  i love barry schwartz ( he 's the guy with the ted talk about choice being demotivating right ? ), 
  glad to help, 
  i 've been flooded with downvotes in the past and messages of `` i was hit and i turned out fine '', 
  happy to help, 
  you 're welcome to x-post it yourself and gain the delicious karma, 
  depression is n't about whether your life is `` good enough '' or not , it 's much more complicated . 
  if you feel down a lot and it 's affecting your life , you should speak to a psychologist . 
  sometimes , people feel pressured to feel a certain way when their life is good and that they must be `` broken '' if they do n't appreciate it enough . 
  happiness is n't that simple . 
  the journal where it was published withdrew wakefield 's study for being clearly falsified .
