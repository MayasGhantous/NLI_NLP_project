  that was the original study that showed the link to autism . 
  there has never been a respectable study showing that it causes autism . 
  suffering from a mental illness does n't mean you 're broken/weak and no-one chooses to be that way . 
  i 'm responding very fast to a lot of people so it 's my bad . 
  yes , other people do feel the way you do . 
  i think you 're making a distinction that is n't really in the literature . 
  behaviour analysis is n't really a thing . 
  are you talking about behaviourism or psychoanalysis ? 
  there is definitely a genetic component to intelligence but it 's not purely genetic . 
  there 's a combination of genes and environment . 
  researchers do n't exactly agree on what % of each ( genes are anywhere from 40 to about 80 % according to some ) but most think it 's about 50/50 . 
  interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  dude , she * can * read your mind , she just does n't want you to know . 
  not as bad as when i wrote a few paragraphs about corporal punishment another time and kept referring to it as cp without realising . 
  thanks for posting this , i really appreciate it . 
  if anyone has any questions/wants further info , feel free to pm me or post . 
  i 'm trying to answer them all . 
  do n't leave me hanging . 
  did she survive the radiation ? 
  want to give me a one/two sentence description of what you do ? 
  i 'm sure it 'll be better than waht i write . 
  happy to help, 
  i live in australia . 
  you can with [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ), 
  if you press permalink on my comment you can do it as a link instead of a self-post . 
  happy to help , if you have any specific interests let me know and i 'll try help you find something, 
  thank not me, 
  well , to be precise , they 're almost certainly wrong in claiming there 's no genetic element but the thrust of what they 're saying is important . 
  i 'm a ** huge ** fan of attachment parenting . 
  attachment theory is one of the best researched concepts in modern psychology and has lifelong implications . 
  if you educate mothers and teach them that , you 'll do far more good for the world than i ever will . 
  also , if you ever get the chance to dissuade people from using corporal punishment , you 'll be a saint . 
  that 's hilarious , i 'm actually starting training on that in two weeks . 
  the research on aba for autistic children is brilliant , it does amazing things . 
  i do n't know much about it outside of that context , sorry . 
  doctors just are n't trained in the same way . 
  i wish more people know about how to find psychologists . 
  he sounds like a smart guy !, 
  it 's kind of like modern psychoanalysis in that in the early days it was a bit ** too ** extreme and people do n't realise that the modern version is very different . 
  glad to hear it !, 
  no problems , let me know if you have any specific interests . 
  yeah , there 's this really harmful notion that people should `` know '' how to parent , like it 's some innate skill that you should have . 
  there are parts of it that we know ** a lot ** about and people are doing themselves a disservice by not understanding more . 
  [ can i give you a book recommendation ? 
  ] ( http://wholebrainchild.com/ ), 
  i appreciate that . 
  glad you got something out of it . 
  i 'm trying to find you something not-too-scholarly to read on it , but i ca n't so i 'll give you a tl ; dr. 
  the biggest difference it seems to have is in coping styles . 
  the tendency is that securely attached people are the best at coping because they learn the world is a safe/manageable place . 
  insecurely attached people fall into two main categories ( some have more categories but i 'm trying to keep it simple-ish ) anxious and avoidant . 
  anxiously attached people are worried they wo n't get care so they hyperactive - get so loud that people ca n't help but hear they need help . 
  you know the type , the world is always coming crashing down and they bring everyone else into their upset . 
  the other extreme end is avoidant where people use deactivating strategies . 
  in this case , the person has n't really learned how to deal with distress so they squash it down , generally not even feeling it . 
  the problem is that this does n't resolve the problem at all . 
  as for what you can do about it , therapy is useful . 
  daniel j siegel has written some great books on the topic , i 'd start there . 
  http://marc.ucla.edu he 's quite involved there and does brilliant stuff . 
  learn to meditate . 
  it 's been shown to have great effects for depression . 
  not a problem, 
  thanks , much appreciated . 
  happy to help, 
  i 'd have to know what you meant first . 
  thank you !, 
  fixed , thank you . 
  i 'm australian, 
  in that case , can you afford a [ book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/healing-trauma-attachment-mind-brain/dp/0393703967/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1339311001&amp;sr=1-1 ) ? 
  do you have a link to a paper ? 
  i 'd be keen to learn more . 
  i added a paragraph on it . 
  well said, 
  it 's a valid point . 
  a big weakness in research is that a large proportion of it is done on university students who are n't the most representative sample . 
  if it were n't for ethics and practical considerations , psychology could do ** way ** more . 
  iteresting til, 
  they 're weak as a result of the illness , that does n't mean that they have it because of a personal deficit . 
  i 've had no less than 20 messages from people thanking me specifically for that statement . 
  if you do n't know the weaknesses of your field better than those not in it , you 're not being a scientist . 
  i can add that if you think it 's a prevalent belief , sure . 
  charming . 
  happy to hear it . 
  thanks, 
  amen brother . 
  i read a great paper on reaction formation and homophobia the other day . 
  thanks , i 'll try to find it myself . 
  you are n't !, 
  what did n't you like about them ? 
  thanks, 
  thanks, 
  i ca n't give you a full answer ( too many replies to give ) but it does n't really matter . 
  subjective experience is important and not all behaviours discussed in therapy need to be discussed in scientific terms . 
  what * is * discussed and studied is the effects of therapy and they 've been widely done . 
  thank you, 
  do n't know it sorry . 
  i 'd recommend looking into mindfulness though , it 's very effective for anxiety . 
  sorry , ma'am . 
  i 'll try find it , i 'll come back to you .
