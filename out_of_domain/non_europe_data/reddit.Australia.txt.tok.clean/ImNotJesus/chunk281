  edit : found it, 
   parental autonomy support and discrepancies between implicit and explicit sexual identities : dynamics of self-acceptance and defense - ryan & weinstein, 
  it was my first experience of self-determination theory , keen to read more . 
  let me know if you like it . 
  no problem at all , try meditation . 
  therapist refers to waht they provide . 
  counsellors and psychologists are types of therapists . 
  you 'll get a better trained person on that directory but you 'll pay more . 
  lastly , the most important thing is that you feel comfortable and their style of therapy matches you well . 
  read the different types and see what sounds good to you but be open, 
  i 'm not blaming anyone , i 'm trying to educate . 
  nope . 
  go here http://marc.ucla.edu, 
  landmark is a self-help cult . 
  get out now, 
  seligman is brilliant , worth a read . 
  i consider self-help books ones by people with no qualifications . 
  much appreciated, 
  spot on, 
  nope , mindfulness has a tonne of research behind it . 
  it 's probably jsut about the most researched thing currently . 
  so jealous, 
  thanks , great info cheers . 
  well said, 
  why , there 's nothing less valid about social psych . 
  do n't let them pressure you , they 're wrong . 
  what in particular within social psych is bs ? 
  obviously it 's not all perfect ( like any science ) . 
  happy to help, 
  happy to help, 
  look for ones written/reviewed by respected psychologists, 
  you 're right on both counts , i tried to summarise a very complicated thing as quickly and as clearly as i could . 
  when i said across time , my big thing was trying to draw a distinction between a state ( oh i feel so depressed ) and a disorder . 
  as for 3 , you 're right and there are some obvious exceptions but i was trying to draw a distinction between natural deviations in personality and a disorder . 
  probably could have done better and i appreciate the feedback, 
  thanks, 
  thank you, 
  thank you it was great . 
  i went out shortly after and have n't been able to look until now , sorry i could n't edit it in time . 
  the mental illness and the maladaptive thoughts are n't the same thing . 
  the mental illness is what ** causes ** the maladaptive thoughts . 
  thanks !, 
  in some cases medication to fix the symtpoms is the best case scenario . 
  there 's no cure for some diseases . 
  in other cases , medication is useful in reducing the symptoms to a point where other therapies/life changes can take effect . 
  based on your description - yes . 
  it 's not that bad , a big proportion of the population do n't have secure attachment ( i do n't ) . 
  the important thing is noticing how it affects your behaviour . 
  does it make you deactivate or hyperactivate ? 
  now that you know , can you start trying to do it less ? 
  that made my day . 
  thank you, 
  i had the same thing with my depression . 
  people thought that because i did n't say anything i was fine . 
  i was n't fine . 
  are you seeing someone for support ? 
  also , have you tried meditation ? 
  contact your local university , if they have a psych program they will probably have some cheap counselling available . 
  in the mean time , start meditating and getting regular exercise . 
  if money is really an issue , you can buy books on how to use certain types of therapies on yourself , it 's not ** as ** good but it can be effective . 
  you could try [ this ] ( http://www.thehappinesstrap.com/ ), 
  how about meditation ? 
  the mods ... bunch of assholes . 
   people jizzing all over the fine mods of this subreddit . 
  thank you, 
  rasha the number of people that hurl abuse at me for not `` making an exception '' for their post when they clearly just did n't read the rules would astound you . 
  if i get a box in the mail that has any polystyrene in it , i need to get my so to pull it out for me . 
  the squeaky sound of polystyrene rubbing against the inside of the box makes me twitch . 
  just not enough to jizz all over me ? 
  i 'm a huge nerd but i somehow have an attractive girlfriend . 
  it 's hard to say without knowing why you have no libido . 
  is he satisfying you in bed ? 
  if not , try toys , using your own hand , more foreplay . 
  do you have problems in the relationship ? 
  if so , fix them first . 
  are you too tired/stressed/busy ? 
  make more time for each other , find some better ways to relax , try to fix your schedule . 
  do you have personal issues you 're working through ? 
  are you depressed , feeling like you have particularly low self-esteem ? 
  have you considered talking to someone ? 
  could you give it a shot ? 
  5 minutes a day is all i 'm asking, 
  your sleeve, 
  bill o'reilly, 
  i 'm calling it early , this 'll be top 10 within the hour . 
  it has everything ; boobs , drama and most importantly , boobs . 
  edit : boom , at 43 minutes it hits # 10 . 
  edit 2 : [ celebration dance ] ( http://awesomegifs.com/wp-content/uploads/lurch-dancing.gif ), 
  http://marc.ucla.edu try the guided meditations . 
   ballsy, 
  you 're looking at different pictures to me, 
  the promise of boobs is powerful enough, 
  first girl i ever kissed ( it was n't even open-mouthed , we just pecked each other on the lips ) started cutting herself and telling me that she 'd kill herself if i did n't become her boyfriend . 
  i was 14 at the time . 
  bonus part of the story : i made her see the school counsellor and then did n't hear from her for a few days until i got a message from the counsellor asking me to come see him . 
  i walked in and he said to me `` she wo n't talk to me about this , i was hoping you could help . '', 
  ( first inappropriate thing ) . 
  i hesitantly agreed and he started trying to get her to talk about it . 
  then , he got frustrated and said `` see , she wo n't talk '' ( second ) . 
  he then decided his best course of action was to leave us in a room to sort it out ( third ) and left us there for an hour at which point i left , he never returned ( fourth ) .
