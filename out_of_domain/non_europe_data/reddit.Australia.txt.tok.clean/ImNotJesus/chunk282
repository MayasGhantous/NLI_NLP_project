  as for what we talked about for an hour : it was her trying to grab my crotch telling me that she 'd do anything with me if i became her boyfriend . 
  bonus bonus story : the only other time i saw the counsellor was when i was in the nurse 's office and there was quite a long queue . 
  he walked in and interrupted the nurse to start asking her for something . 
  some like 7 year old kid had been waiting a while so she asked why he was allowed to push in , he said `` i 've got diabetes and if i do n't get help right now ** i could die ** '' . 
  poor girl was mortified . 
  how 's that working out for you pal ? 
  his hand dumped * him * . 
  it caught him cheating with lefty . 
  do n't leave us hanging ... did it ? 
  sorry to hear that , total dick move . 
  i get that a lot, 
  i tried to test it a few times . 
  i tried to turn water into wine but it only made grape juice . 
  then , i tried to cure a blind man but all it did was cure his flu . 
  they ca n't all be winners mrwubbles but thank you . 
  ca n't it be both ?

  modesty is in my top 3 best qualities , along with physical perfection and being amazing at everything . 
  +1 for likelihood to spend a day with you, 
  if we hung out for the day you 'd fap at least 5 times ? 
   real scientific studies confirming many of the claims,

  if this was a competition , you 'd be winning . 
  actually , probably second to the no murder guy . 
  in that case ... most embarrassing fapping story ? 
  in that case , why do you come off as an asshole ? 
  i like `` well fuck me sideways with a hammer '', 
  doctors and nurses in hospitals make mistakes ** all the time ** . 
  they work crazy hours , have too much to do and small errors can change someone 's life . 
  i do n't even blame them , the conditions make it impossible . 
  then there 's jimmy carr who devotes a section of his show ( sometimes ) to letting people heckle him . 
  it 's partly a cultural thing too , there 's much more heckling in the uk than the us .

  holy shit , that 's full on . 
  worst story i 've heard ( this is 3rd hand so take it with a grain of salt ) :, 
  old lady had a fall at home so she went into the hospital . 
  now , old people 's skin is n't as elastic so it kind of peels back if you tear it enough ( i 've heard it referred to as being `` de-gloved '' ) . 
  so , as it was a busy hospital , a nurse saw her hand and wrapped it in a bandage and put her into a room , forgetting about her . 
  she was n't seen for a while because no-one remembered she was there and when she was finally seen , they did n't think to take off the bandage . 
  her hand got infected and she died a day later . 
  honours , that 's right . 
  good luck !, 
  thanks pal , that 's sweet of you to say, 
  please, 
  on that note , how does one get minions ? 
  i 've been looking for ages .

  a friend of mine recently went to an australian mining town ( the classiest of classy areas ) and was talking to a girl in a bar . 
  after 30 seconds she turned to him and said `` you 're not from around here , are you ? '' . 
  he said , `` no , how did you know ? '' . 
  well , she said , `` you did n't come up to me , grab my hair and say hey cunt , show us your fuck hole . '',

  back in my day you had to get your older brother to buy you a magazine or wait 20 minutes per picture if i wanted to see a naked lady,

  here 's a good rule of thumb ; whether you 're male or female , if you need a bra when running , you should n't be doing it topless . 
  i used to have vegemite as a pasta sauce . 
  in fact , i ate so few things that my mum used to bring vegemite in her purse to restaurants and ask them to put some with butter on plain pasta for me if i could n't find anything on the menu i liked . 
  she 's on top , getting vigorous , pulls away too far , i slip out and hit her pelvis . 
  has happened more than once , never fun .

  i have more access to information than the richest king 10 years ago .

  yes , for things like cp . 
  also , there are shadowbans for spamming . 
  mods also can and do ban people from subreddits but we ca n't ban from other subs . 
  `` this will look really stupid when i 'm 60 '', 
  * getting a post on the front page, 
  * having a top reply to a post on the front page, 
  * having someone recognise your username from a different post, 
  * being abused mercilessly for giving your opinion, 
  * continuing an argument well after everyone else besides you and this person have left the post, 
  * posting something that you think is hilarious , only to find out it 's a repost . 
  * getting banned by / r/shitredditsays, 
  * upvoting something in / new and seeing it hit # 1, 
  * mod a pointless subreddit,

  my hanson4eva tat will stay cool,
