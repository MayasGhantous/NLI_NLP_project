  the only reason i 'm still here is getting to ban people . 
  [ two can play at that game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ajhkd.png ), 
  i 'd be lying if i said that i did n't know 75 % of the words to that song, 
  [ i have two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/rightsubreddit ), 
  * being called a legendary redditor . 
  shitty_watercolour , if you hear me and come paint this , i 'll make karmanaut jokes for the rest of the day, 
  first / r/atheism was a circlejerk , then calling / r/atheism a circlejerk became a circlejerk . 
  now , pointing out that the '' / r/atheism is a circlejerk '' group are circlejerking has become a circlejerk . 
  it 's the * ciiiiiircle of jerk * . 
  you ca n't say that and not give us a demo . 
  you are to me , elf_dreams . 
  you are to me . 
  people post abuse at the mods all the time , so yes . 
  you say pointless , i say hilarious, 
  being a part of a nazi pun thread, 
  australia - where you call your mate a cunt , and a cunt your mate . 
  that 's ... heartwarming ? 
  i get that all the time , that 's why i had to make it my username . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  depends on my mood . 
  sometimes i use it as a way of making me feel * anything * . 
  like , if i just do n't feel right but do n't know what 's going on under the surface , i 'll play a bit of [ grace ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3adfwke9je ) and it 'll bring it out of me, 
  exactly , especially if you can prove it by catching him red - * handed * . 
  you know , * pull * out your phone and he 'll be * fucked by his own actions * . 
  you can * beat * him if you 've got * hard * evidence . 
  in all seriousness , they 'd never fire you directly after making a sexual harassment claim , they 'd be begging to be sued and you 'd win ** a lot ** of money . 
  edit : document everything with dates/times , make sure you have written verification from hr that they 've taken your complaint , make sure there 's a long paper trail so that if they fire you , you can show how soon it came after making those claims . 
  seriously , i probably do n't live on the same continent as you and i got this message in a matter of seconds . 
  the data took a quick stop in ** space ** on the way too . 
  and their computers had access to a fraction of the information i can access now . 
  [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xovs_syyxe8 ) from good will hunting, 
  there was no chance that this would n't be top, 
  wait , what ? 
  how ? 
  even when i smoked i hated the smell . 
  i had to hold it away from me or i 'd start greening . 
  he got kicked off the karmawhores list too . 
  i think i know what happened . 
  karmanaut, 
  yeah , someone put me in touch with the webmaster , he fixed it for me, 
  thank you kindly, 
  terrifying, 
  honestly , by all objective measures , i think we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  i know this wo n't be a popular view in this post but i think it 's true . 
  we 've never lived in a world with less violence , better healthcare , better education , less segregation , more equal rights or longer life expectancies . 
  the world fucking rocks . 
  because you 're insecure and deep-down you think that she could n't really love you so you neurotically focus on her past in a way of self-sabotaging the relationship before you can get really invested and more importantly , hurt . 
  [ here you go sir ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8wbiylmxiae/t7jhxqobfui/aaaaaaaabl4/42xcfeccdhi/s320/game-of-thrones-upvote-reddit.gif ), 
  exam tomorrow , my brain is turning to mush and reddit is seducing me away from my studies . 
  i thought i told you that askreddit is my turf . 
  get outta here you no-goodnik, 
  in the words of bill : methinks the lady doth protest too much, 
  do n't lie , you love the attention . 
  i 'm judging you more for not being able to . 
  i 'm approaching karmanaut 's comment karma , i think i 'll be out of here soon enough anyway . 
  why weird ? 
  also , do you have a planned stopping point or you still enjoying it ? 
  when i was going through my depression , no song encapsulated how i felt more than this song :, 
  [ uncomfortably slow - newton faulkner ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfnc3ao6-h8 ), 
  it regularly put me into tears but it made me feel good to know that i was n't the only person to ever feel like that . 
  i still listen to it from time to time ( now that i 'm passed my depression ) to remember what it felt like . 
  it helps me appreciate how wonderful my life is now . 
  decided to be with me . 
  she can do much , much better . 
  if my so used reddit she would n't be my so for much longer, 
  i should take it as a compliment ? 
  my brain hurts pal, 
  it 's mostly because i 'm sane though . 
  actually , in some ways it 's easier to get karma during quieter times . 
  you get that when you 're scuba diving and are balanced . 
  it 's the most awesome feeling . 
  the first moment of warm shower on a cold morning . 
  it 's followed by the worst feeling in the world - getting out . 
  similarly , being lightly tickled on the back by someone you 're in love with . 
  fair call, 
  more aussies around and we 're awesome . 
  you have a lot of anger , my child . 
  also , considering your entire account is following tir around and saying fuck you , i do n't think you have a lot of `` i work for my karma '' higher ground here . 
  well done , some original content , no-one has ever made a comment about my username, 
  it has so many downvotes it 's hidden . 
  the x children is how many comments are attached to it . 
  [ corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and, 
  experiences : a meta-analytic and theoretical review ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ), 
  tl ; dr hitting kids is a terrible way to change behaviour as it increases immediate compliance but does n't change behaviour long-term - the child acts correctly to avoid being hit but does n't change behaviour overall . 
  also , there are big negatives including increased rates of mental health issues , aggression and harming the parent-child relationship . 
  not telling anyone how to parent , but that 's what the science says . 
  -5 i think, 
  * bows head *, 
  btw , you do n't need to remove the upvote you give yourself . 
  it does n't count towards your total karma so you 're not `` cheating the system '' or anything . 
  fucked if i know, 
  why are you so angry pal ? 
  that 's sad . 
  why do n't you make a happy novelty account ? 
  i was n't suggesting that you have to , i 'm just saying that it scared me off personally trying it . 
  i 'm not criticising anyone who takes it at all . 
  thanks pal, 
  i get the same on askreddit . 
  why ca n't i post about my charity ?
