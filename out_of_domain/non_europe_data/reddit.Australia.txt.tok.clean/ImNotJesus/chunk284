  it 's a good cause . 
  do you have children/kittens ? 
  i know it says no medical help but i ca n't afford it and i 'm scared, 
  are you ... ? 
  job : i work with autistic children 1on1 teaching them basic skills using [ applied behavior analysis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/applied_behavior_analysis ) and just finished a job where i take incident reports from hospitals ( if there 's some sort of error/incident , they have to call us and make a report ), 
  study : i study psychology ( [ as seen here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/utthk/scientists_of_reddit_what_misconceptions_do_us/ ) ), 
  `` i 'm ** not ** pregnant '' - my ( now ) ex-girlfriend, 
  edit : clarity, 
  you always got ta remember to stay ... hiv positive . 
  i 'm hurt . 
  i wo n't lie , i 'm hurt . 
  edit : for all of those messaging me telling me they 've downvoted tir heaps , i want to be clear that i was just making a joke . 
  i really like tir , he 's a nice guy and adds lots of content ( whether you enjoy all of it or not ) and deserves to have lots of upvotes because of that . 
  if you want to hate anyone on my behalf , make it someone i [ actually dislike ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/epic_comebacks ) . 
  protip : if you respond to him by saying `` that was n't an epic comeback '' , he goes nuts . 
  edit 2 : since we 're all having fun hating on him ... 
  i know a secret !, 
  guess who 's behind fuck_trappedinreddit ? 
  that 's right , epic_comebacks himself . 
  feel free to also reply that to any time fuck_trappedinreddit posts anything . 
  this one flu the coop already, 
  that news was n't as great, 
  [ you are * not * the father ] ( http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/257767_o.gif ), 
  fair enough , 75 % of my karma is from here, 
  edit : i accidentally a letter . 
  [ this terrifying man ] ( http://famousmonstersoffilmland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hannibal.jpg ), 
  it still stands up as terrifying , unlike most older horror/thrillers, 
  it does , it does help . 
  you 're now tagged as `` definitely do n't ban '', 
  ahh yes , my plan of complaining about it so people keep telling me how much they upvote me as a way to pump up my ego before my exam is working . 
  ps : i always try to reply when people talk to me , it 's just rude not to . 
  edit : i do n't want to make any promises i ca n't keep . 
  if i 've got one of the top comments on a few big askreddit posts my inbox gets flooded . 
  i do read them all and answer everything i can but it 's not always possible to give a reply so i 'm sorry if i do n't . 
  honestly , that means a lot more to me than having a lot of upvotes from you . 
  i do n't get the hate for tir , he 's a super nice guy . 
  i know that no-one is liked by everyone but tir is a friendly guy that adds a lot of good content . 
  thanks but i do n't want you to hate on tir , he 's a nice guy . 
  it 's ... over 9000, 
  thanks !, 
  thanks pal , fixed . 
  do n't be sorry , that was awesome . 
  * blushes *, 
  if i reply to this , am i now winning ? 
  that 's okay , i 'll work for your love, 
  oh brilliant , that just made my day . 
  ps : that really was n't a very epic comeback . 
  wow , thanks , it 's really nice to know that . 
  was that when i was talking about my struggles with eating or did i give you some advice ? 
  much appreciated , 
  wow . 
  i 'm so glad !, 
  nice try , guy attempting to destroy the sanctity of marriage . 
  there 's a comedian who does a bit about that , i ca n't think of who and it 's killing me . 
  edit : ~ ~ some googling suggests michael ian black but i ca n't find the bit itself . 
  my google search history looks quite odd right now . ~ ~, 
  edit 2 : octal40 and aldairion are better at google-fu than i, 
  me and a co-worker talking about the holocaust . 
  another co-worker interrupts to ask `` what 's the holocaust ? '', 
  here you go pal , have a nice day . 
  you coulda just pmed me , i think i 'm fairly friendly . 
  i generally prefer being referred to as things that remind me of cthulhu, 
  [ geraffes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8aqjh/awww_this_is_just_too_sad_pic/c08pp5z ), 
  it 's basically the greatest thing ever, 
  i agree and i do n't buy any of the same account rumours normally . 
  this one i found funny because they 're my 2 least liked accounts . 
  i had to say , i was too excited not to . 
  hey buddy , how 's it going ? 
  haha , good thanks mate, 
  thanks pal, 
  i 've thought about it , wish i could . 
  still searching , lem me know if you find some . 
  * mumble * * mumble * * mumble * * mumble * * mumble * hey macarena, 
  spend as much time on reddit as i do, 
  talk to a psychologist or meditate . 
  i wo n't lie , it 's been a great day . 
  do n't get too close , he has hpv . 
  ... of laughter ? 
  i 'm sorry , i meant it in jest . 
  if it makes you feel better , i once had to call the girl who gave me chlamydia ( which i also passed on to my so ) to tell her that she 'd given it to me . 
  that was awkward . 
  i use, 
  `` pretty fly for a wi-fi '', 
  because i like all of my references to be from the 90s . 
  i do n't always take people hostage but when i do , i stop for a bit of dance moms . 
  [ was it this guy ? 
  ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llj824qzsa1qcy73f.gif ), 
  thank you very much , that 's so kind of you to say . 
  wow , thank you kindly . 
  only the true messiah denies his divinity, 
  thanks pal , consider my back patted . 
  i was having a fairly shit day and you 've really made me smile . 
  that 's an awesome story , dude . 
  wow , that 's crazy . 
  you 've done a great thing though . 
  that happens . 
  you should n't ever regret trying to reach out and help someone though . 
  if you really feel that appreciative , you can pay me back by donating blood to your local blood bank . 
  that 's awesome man . 
  you know there was a recent study that showed that we get more enjoyment out of money we spend on other people than money we spend on ourselves .
