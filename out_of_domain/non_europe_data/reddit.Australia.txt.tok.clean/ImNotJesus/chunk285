  so , assuming you have $ 20 and you want to use it to make yourself happy ( and you 've got all your basic needs met obviously ) , you should do something nice with it . 
  that 's fair enough , i clearly have a lot of spare time in my job ( as seen by how much i comment ) . 
  there are all sorts of things you can do to help people though . 
  have you ever given blood ? 
  an hour of your time and you could save several lives . 
  did you know that he 's also fuck_trappedinreddit, 
  when i was a little kid and commented on my aunt 's moustache . 
  it was n't [ orichetti ] ( http://thelanguagechef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/orichetti.jpg ) ? 
  at least it was positive !, 
  you were cheering him on . 
  wow ... why ? 
  at dance moms or my joke ? 
  dagger right to the heart . 
  lapdance for an upvote ? 
  honestly , i 'd just had enough of passively putting up with the guy . 
  he 's sent me no less than 20 pms attempting to make fun of me and i never responded . 
  he also replies to my posts constantly trying to make fun of me for having a psychology degree ( weird , right ? ), 
  and is just generally a douchebag . 
  when i knew he was also fuck_trappedinreddit i could n't help myself . 
  i do n't want people to harass the guy , though , i just want him to leave me the fuck alone . 
  now you 've got me craving chocolate . 
  consider your last good deed now undone . 
  30 minutes before the interview i want you to do something for me . 
  you 're going to start writing . 
  just start writing all the things you 're worried about , let them out of your head . 
  then , i want you to spend a minute just letting yourself relax , sit there and breathe and concentrate on the sensation of your breath . 
  both of these things drastically improve performance . 
  one more thing - you 're going to be a bit anxious tomorrow , ** that 's a good thing ** . 
  performance is best with a medium level of anxiety . 
  so , do n't fight it , you want to be a bit fired up . 
  and if you do that , you 'll stop it becoming * too much * anxiety . 
  you better !, 
  let me start by saying that i 'm sorry for what you 've been through . 
  ** you 're always allowed to feel what you 're feeling ** . 
  it 's never `` wrong '' to feel a certain way . 
  if you feel violated , you feel violated . 
  you ca n't control your feelings , the only thing you can control is how you decide to react to them . 
  you can go to a meeting but you may feel more comfortable speaking to a therapist 1on1 because you 'll be able to talk about a lot more . 
  the story itself really does n't matter in terms of getting help . 
  if you 're upset , if you feel like you need support , you should contact a psychologist . 
  that 's understandable , it can be a scary step to take . 
  do you know what 's stopping you from picking up the phone ? 
  getting angry at yourself is n't helpful right now . 
  do you have a good enough relationship with your manager that you could say something to the extent of `` hey , i do n't want to make any complaints and i ca n't really talk about the details but i do n't feel completely comfortable working with x. 
  it 's okay if you ca n't but you can try to make it so we do n't work together ? '', 
  either way , people go speak to psychologists for stress anyway . 
  you do n't need to be `` broken '' or have a `` good enough reason '' . 
  when i saw a psychologist i used to tell him that i felt like an asshole for being depressed because i did n't `` deserve '' to feel that way , like i had n't had enough bad happen to me . 
  who cares ? 
  you 're at where you 're at and you 're not happy right now because of this . 
  you want to be happier so you 're going to be brave and make that call . 
  no psychologist will ever laugh at you for seeking help . 
  you have the right to make a complaint if you want but it 's up to you . 
  right now , your # 1 priority is your own health . 
  you can only do what you can do pal, 
  honestly , please let me know how you go . 
  i expect a pm when you make an appointment . 
  if you have any problems or need any advice about therapy , just let me know . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imnotjesus ), 
  yes !, 
  if you listen to anything , make sure it 's calm and does n't have words . 
  i listen to beethoven . 
  look . 
  i * may * spend more time on reddit than i should . 
  spot on . 
  i sometimes use [ this ] ( http://www.rainymood.com/ ), 
  there 's going to be a test at the end, 
  i do the same with watching shows/playing games/being on reddit because otherwise i end up eating ** way ** too much crap . 
  sorry pal , i added more so it threw off your numbering system but these are good additions . 
  that 's brilliant !, 
  it 's already too late !, 
  maybe just start again from 1 , i 'm sure people understand anyway . 
  i do n't really know what you think about this is bullshit or why you think i 'm trying to `` be karmanaut '' . 
  what exactly am i doing that upsets you ? 
  he 's just a really angry kid . 
  i tried everything i could to tell him to fuck off but he keeps following me around ( hence the 60 downvotes in that picture ) from thread to thread . 
  i probably went overboard but i do n't even understand what his problem with me was, 
  not sure whether to be happy or sad that i was called a karma guru . 
  either way , i 'm just a guy who likes helping people out/making jokes/giving people good info . 
  i 'm really nothing special , just have a lot of time at work on reddit . 
  fair call , i 'm sure it says much more about him than it does about me . 
  happy to help, 
  as in , that you 're getting them ? 
  1 ) i 've said that i like getting karma . 
  that 's because it 's nice to have people think you 're funny/interesting . 
  i take no shame in that . 
  2 ) i 'm in the new queue of askreddit constantly , ask any of the regulars there . 
  the ones that rise tend to be the ones i answer because they 're better/funnier/more interesting, 
  3 ) i sometimes regret posts i make . 
  i make a lot of posts , it 's natural i 'm not proud of all of them . 
  why should i leave bad posts there out of shame ? 
  if i still believe in what i 've said , i 'll keep it . 
  just the other day i made a post about the science of corporal punishment that sat at -20 . 
  i stand by what i said . 
  any other issues ? 
  thanks pal , that 's sweet of you to say . 
  so now it 's that i post too much in the same thread ? 
  i think there 's no shame in liking that you receive karma . 
  who does n't want to be considered funny and/or interesting ? 
  do n't feel guilty for that , just do n't let it be your only focus .
