  i get more enjoyment if i get 10 karma on a well presented argument than 100 on a joke . 
  ~ ~ masturbating on the bus ~ ~, 
  i use the express lane when i know i have a few too many items in my basket . 
  we used to have these things called cd stores . 
  they 're all out of business now . 
  thank you i like you too . 
  i refuse to ever use physical punishment on my kids . 
  the science says that it does n't work and i think it 's a horrible thing to do . 
  you 've nailed me . 
  i 'm so , so upset about studying psychology that i 'm taking out my anger on you . 
  i 'm clearly not at all proud of what i do and i never discuss it any more on reddit thanks to you shaming me . 
  and when have i said that it would ? 
  i 'll be studying for a lot longer . 
  oh my god . 
  why do you keep telling me this . 
  i 'm in the fucking field , i know that . 
  stop messaging me . 
  just stop . 
  i 've ** never ** proclaimed myself an expert . 
  if you have an issue with something i 'm saying , feel free to argue with the merits of my actual posts . 
  just stop replying randomly to all of my posts and sending me pms . 
  i do n't like you , i do n't want to hear from you and you add nothing of value to my life . 
  just . 
  stop . 
  yes , i study the science of psychology , that 's what i do . 
  i also had dozens of people who practice that thanked me for posting it and changed anything they said was inaccurate ( a couple of slight modifications ) . 
  i never proclaimed myself an expert and at several points ** asked people to correct me ** . 
  where i was n't sure about things i researched before posting . 
  also , several people asked me what level of study i was at and i answered them . 
  i was completely transparent . 
  please stop messaging me and replying to my posts . 
  please . 
  hi pal , how 's it going ? 
  happy it helped, 
  i sit but do what 's comfortable, 
  yes !!!, 
  i 'm so happy for you !, 
  while this is true , altered states of consciousness effect your ability to encode memories and diminish cognitive abilities . 
  it 's still not worth it . 
  i would 've thought that watching a video of yourself reddit all night would n't be that upsetting . 
  grats !, 
  i just hit # 10 . 
  karmanaut is # 9 so if i 'm banned in the next few days , you 'll know why . 
  if i see the word jesus i read the reply pretty quickly , i wo n't lie . 
  i 'd prefer a kind message and a blood bank donation !, 
  at least i took out epic_comebacks / fuck_trappedinreddit before i died . 
  if for nothing else , reddit was worthwhile . 
  people like my comments on a popular website . 
  you want me to call his mother a hamster ? 
  taurus : you 're going to have sex with someone who thinks you 're a fucking idiot . 
  i ate two footlong subs with double meat and washed it down with a 1.25 l tub of ice-cream . 
  by remembering that everything passes . 
  how i feel in that moment wo n't define the rest of my life , just that moment . 
  it 's not possible or desirable to be `` happy '' all the time . 
  people who do n't like posts about saving cancer patients . 
  what if we 're only 1 like away from zuckerberg saving someone ? 
  edit : i should name and shame myself . 
  a few years ago i put my religion as `` teapot agnostic '' because i thought it showed how clever i was . 
  i doubt anyone noticed and/or cared . 
  wait , you begrudge people making an informed decision about their recreation ? 
  but you 're complaining about people who know what they 're doing . 
  clearly they do n't find it as corrupt and harmful as you do . 
  you sound like you 've got a lot of anger there pal, 
  i used to believe in fate , then i started studying psychology . 
  i think we find the patterns we want to see . 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
  / r/circlejerk, 
  present one . 
  easily . 
  by all objective measures we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  sure , with a few changes we could make it even better than it is but we have better healthcare , equality , education and lower violence . 
  learn to mediate . 
  it improves memory and reduces anxiety significantly . 
  / r/panichistory does it for me . 
  it makes me realise that i 'm not insane for thinking that a lot of people on this site are . 
  people who want anything should avoid absolutes . 
  mental health is about balance . 
  for example , an anxiety disorder ( too much anxiety ) is a horrible and debilitating thing to experience . 
  no anxiety leads to you thinking `` hmm this roof seems like a good place to jump off '' . 
  if you avoid difficult experiences your whole life ( like receiving criticism ) you never learn resilience . 
  if you face too much , it cripples you . 
  the key is balance . 
  [ already exists ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/ ) and it 's awesome . 
  because a modern psychological understanding of obesity suggests that it is n't as simple as `` they choose to be fat '' . 
  no one * wants * to be fat . 
  no one * wants * to feel undesirable and cut their life short . 
  if they get enough friction from their legs rubbing together ... 
  someone with binge eating disorder chooses to struggle with food as much as a person with depression chooses to be sad . 
  it 's not as easy as giving you a source , it 's much more complicated than x paper proves this point . 
  there are a bunch of books on it by psychologists . 
  there 's also a great yale course on the psychology of food . 
  so anyone whose behaviours make them cost more tax dollars should be ridiculed by society ? 
  if you really think it 's all that simple , you have little of value to add to this discussion . 
  that 's a scientific claim . 
  do you have a basis for that ? 
  what % of the obese suffer from one ? 
  also , i never said all fat people suffer from bed . 
  it was an example . 
  okay , i can see how what i wrote suggested that . 
  i certainly do n't want to make the case that all people who are obese are so because of a disorder .
