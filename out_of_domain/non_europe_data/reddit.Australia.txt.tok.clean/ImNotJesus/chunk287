  the larger point i wanted to make is that it is n't that simple . 
  you do n't need to do it by yourself . 
  find a group , find a good psychologist and find some supportive friends . 
  you can find psychologists who use positive psychology , just ask them before you make an appointment . 
  if you 're interested , you should start practising mindfulness . 
  it 's had amazing research results in the last 10 years or so . 
  have a look at this : http://marc.ucla.edu, 
  i would n't quite say that . 
  positive psychology is ** very ** important but in a lot of cases it is n't the # 1 priority . 
  sometimes you need to treat the illness before it 's possible to improve health . 
  it 's like warm apple pie ... 
  ( i was 18 at the time ), 
  i had a crush on this girl for ages . 
  i 'd put in months of 1on1 time and i felt like she was finally starting to like . 
  so , we were at her place and playing poker . 
  i said , how about the loser has to give the winner a massage . 
  she agreed and i made sure to lose in the next few hands . 
  cut to , her lying on her bed , me sitting on top of her ass , huge boner prominent , giving her a back rub . 
  things were going great until her ( extremely religious ) mum walked in . 
  the best part was , her mum was so surprised and did n't know how to react and she just started having a conversation with us . 
  after about a minute of shock , i climbed off her ass . 
  we continued talking to her mother for another 5 minutes . 
  i was too frazzled and she went on a year-long trip shortly after . 
  she was also my deb ball ( prom ) partner and i was about to make out with her when i had to run out of the room to vomit violently . 
  most upvoted comments are hard to find . 
  most upvoted posts is just http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top, 
  in high school ( 14 years old ) they split up the boys and girls for sex ed so we naturally spend the whole next class comparing . 
  i told a girl in my class about this picture i 'd seen of a horribly gross cock that was covered in stds and described what it looked like . 
  she responded by asking `` can you catch that if you like do n't have sex with it but just let him rub it all over your face ? '', 
  it 's not the weakest per say but more that the most extreme will come to the surface . 
  if you had a thread asking about their most embarrassing moment , the stories you 'll read are the ** most ** embarrassing ones . 
  you do n't hear a lot of stories on reddit about strawberry picking because it 's fucking boring to read about . 
  that does n't mean that reddit has a disproportionately small number of strawberry pickers . 
  i 'm sure reddit is right on the average for times shitting the bed for the age-group , you just do n't heal from all the people who ** do n't ** shit the bed, 
  he must not combine sleeping pills with powerful laxatives . 
  no pal but there was no mistaking that boner, 
  natural and chemical free imply healthier or less produced but actually mean fuck all . 
  also , i really hate when high sugar products say low fat . 
  there 's a brand of candy in australia called the `` natural confectionery company '' and all of their products are 99 % fat free . 
  of course they are , that entire 99 % is sugar . 
  you think you 're the only one who feels exactly like that . 
  you 're not . 
  you 're not alone , your life experience is understood better than you know by those around you . 
  reach out and touch someone 's else life by connecting to them . 
  you 'd by the entire world a coke ? 
  similarly , studies have shown that people are terrible at predicting what will/won ' t make them happy in the future . 
  it 's called affective forecasting and people always over-estimate how much something will change their experience of the world . 
  something something something pharmaceutical company something something natural something something . 
  i tune out when stupid people talk .

  best of luck and i 'm sorry for your loss .

  there 's an antiquated view that if your kids see potentially damaging things before they 're old enough to understand them , it will negatively effect them . 
  the problem is that if you want to protect your kids , you should be doing ** the exact opposite ** . 
  you want to be the one that educates your kids about drugs , not their friends at school . 
  you want to be the one who teaches them about sex and sexuality , not the internet . 
  even if you do n't explicitly say that you 're asking for legal advice , it 's what you 're doing . 
  no-one here is qualified to answer that . 
  contact them directly or consult a lawyer . 
  also , recent studies have shown you gain more enjoyment from spending money on someone else than you do spending it on yourself . 
  of course you should take care of your basic needs but if you 've done that , there 's immense joy to be found in helping those around you . 
  i do n't agree to that . 
  i think that if you make it impossible for someone else to use a seat , you should pay for two . 
  i also think that if you believe people are obese simply because they 're `` over indulgent '' you have very little understanding of this issue . 
  sure , make the post about ethics and explicitly state ( in bold ) that you do n't want legal advice . 
  someone told me that cats were n't the best pet , 9gag was funny , neil degrasse tyson is an idiot and zach braff has an uninteresting twitter account . 
  it 's 7:38 am here, 
  the policeman is singing from his squad car bullhorn as he trails them . 
  are you trying to suggest that i 'm being an asshole ? 
  i 've had about a 6 month long argument with a friend on facebook about alternative medicine . 
  on the plus side , i get regular messages from a bunch of mutual friends telling me how hilarious it is and how much i 'm winning by . 
  on the downside , his career is still going to kill people . 
  stupid people , but people . 
  it 's worth noticing that tone does n't always translate well , especially when we do n't have an existing relationship . 
  it 's not unusual for mods to get random abuse so i assumed that 's what was going on . 
  sorry if i misread it . 
  sounds like a challenge . 
  i may be remembering this wrong but i thought organic vegetables were called that because they were birthed individually by unicorns . 
  i 'm not . 
  i never said it was n't related . 
  i said that if you think it 's about being over indulgent , you have very little understanding of the issue . 
  the fact that you still do n't understand me , only further proves my point . 
  umm , my bottle of water is dihydrogen monoxide free okay . 
  i 'm the bigger person . 
  / r/asksocialscience is n't that well known and it 's awesome . 
  i 'm not going to spend my time going into it with you because i think you 're already too set in your position . 
  there 's a yale lecture series online about the psychology of food . 
  you can watch that if you actually care but i do n't think you do . 
  high fructose corn syrup, 
  adorable, 
  also , if you inhale enough of it , it can kill you . 
  why is n't the government doing more to protect us ?

  it 's funny because we hate that he makes music for a different demographic . 
  stupid talented people that do n't make art exclusively for me . 
  i think the first will days will be shock that he can actually die . 
  have a tried a lawyer 's office ? 
  you 're an idiot,
