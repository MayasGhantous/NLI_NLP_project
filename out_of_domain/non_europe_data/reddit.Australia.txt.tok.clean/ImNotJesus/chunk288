  read it as `` monkey '' , was disappointed . 
  e pluribus unum should be on the money though . 
  if you have a problem with what the eli5 mods do , contact them . 
  this is n't an appropriate question for askreddit, 
  do not drink water . 
  if you 're good and work fast , you can make a few hundred dollars an hour giving $ 10 handjobs . 
  you 're welcome to disagree but as the mod of a big subreddit , i would be annoyed if the person making claims did n't take the minimum level of effort to ask me what actually happened . 
  there may be a very good reason for it and i 'm not going to let you turn askreddit into your lynchmob when you do n't even know * why * they removed it . 
  especially considering there is an explanation in the thread itself . 
  if you want to ask a ** general ** question about mods having the ability to remove posts and not mention this , i 'll let your post go through . 
  i 've tried , you ca n't get pregnant that way . 
  i 'm not trying to be `` that atheist guy '' but i think `` the god delusion '' will be remembered for having a huge cultural impact ( irrespective of whether you think it 's good/bad ) . 
  i think it 's the day you decide how you want to define yourself as a man because that 's the day you let go of `` what a man should be '' and focus on who you ** want ** to be . 
  for me , the day i became a man was when i was having a horrible day , in the midst of a depression . 
  i felt terrible and had been stuck in place for a long time . 
  my sister came home ( she did n't live there any more ) because she 'd just broken up with her partner and i instantly snapped into ` taking care of her ' mode . 
  that was the day that i realised what kind of man i wanted to be . 
  i think having that realisation that you want more than your moment to moment experience provides , makes you a man . 
  edit : damn you , ever since you asked this question i ca n't get the dr horrible song out of my head, 
  people think that teachers earn money ? 
  is n't that like a well-known thing that they 're underpaid horribly ? 
  my job is the best job in the world . 
  i spend an hour out of every 8 working and the rest i spend on reddit or studying . 
  i also get paid better than i should for my level of education and i get crazy stories from it too . 
  i went to a group interview the other day . 
  it finished at 6:30 on a friday night and we were all told that we 'd be informed mid next week . 
  at 8:00 i got a message saying that all 3 interviewers wanted me on the spot so they did n't think they needed to make me wait to find out . 
  thanks pal , you too . 
  i eat too much junk food . 
  i do n't justify it , i loathe myself to the point of needing to eat more food to make me feel better . 
  blowjobs . 
  i could give you some sweet answer about love and support but regular blowjobs . 
  i understand that this must be a really tough time for you right now but i really recommend that you speak to someone before you make any big decisions . 
  if you do n't want to treat the cancer that 's your choice but there 's no way you can possibly be making a rational decision with everything that 's going on . 
  do you have access to some grief counselling ? 
  i work in a call centre that takes incident reports from hospitals . 
  they essentially do n't care what i do as long as i 'm there to take the calls when they * do * come in . 
  the role ends soon though :(, 
  read in fat bastard 's voice, 
  no-one chooses to be tortured by food every meal, 
  i never said what is/isn ` t. 
  i said she should speak to someone to work that out . 
  red wine . 
  i know the studies say that in a blind taste test i ca n't tell the difference but i still enjoy the fuck out of that placebo effect . 
  and if that 's what you want to do that 's okay . 
  i 'm not at all trying to do you what you should/shouldn ' t decide . 
  i just want to make sure you go through the process of ** making sure ** it 's what you really want and not biassed by how difficult what you 're going through must be . 
  so does art have to express something or can it simply be art because it 's beautiful ? 
  let 's say i make a beautiful melody but it 's devoid of all personal meaning and is simply intended to sound beautiful . 
  is that still art ? 
  how do you define the `` soul '' ? 
  it means many different things to many different people . 
  so brave, 
  have you tried talking to her about it ? 
  i do n't mean confronting her , i mean asking her why she 's so worried about being fat and what that would mean about her . 
  treasure hunt that leads to a balloon saying `` i 'm leaving you '' . 
  seriously though , if you 're having problems you need to be talking about these things before just getting up and leaving . 
  have you tried counselling ? 
  have you been trying to work through it together ? 
  you have a kid , you owe it to your kid to at least try . 
  yeah , i 'd give the mum a heads up that she 's taking cues from her dieting struggles that it 's something to be preoccupied with . 
  make sure the mum let 's her know that she wants to lose weight so that she can be ** healthy ** , not so that she can be pretty . 
  you have a job right now , it 's finding a new one . 
  if you do n't spend 9-5 actively searching , you 're not doing enough . 
  not once she pays for a room to work in , reception fees ( if it 's at a clinic ) and insurance . 
  also , you make no money if you get sick and get burnt out very quickly ( i bet you 've never met a therapist who did n't need to take regular breaks ) . 
  that made me giggle . 
  did it work ? 
  do you have a good enough relationship with her to talk to her about it ? 
  i 'd at least try to talk to the mom . 
  explain to her that it 's causing a lot of anxiety and could lead to future problems . 
  worth a shot . 
  protip : you can get medicare for therapists but you need a gp referral . 
  ( i 'm an aussie too ), 
  not sure about others, 
  you never have to do anything in a relationship that you do n't feel comfortable with . 
  she 's asking you to jump through hoops . 
  you can if you want to , you should n't if you do n't want to . 
  no-one can answer this for you . 
  ** why are we yelling ? 
  my sister tried to punch me once ever . 
  i ducked and she broke her finger hitting the wall . 
  anyone who remembers this is literally hitler, 
  / r/asksocialscience ( informative ), 
  / r/askculinary ( informative ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's from a ww2 documentary, 
  you 've been holding onto this until today , have n't you ? 
  10 years . 
  is this definitely the right relationship and career . 
  i think it is , but that confirmation would really help me take the leap . 
  `` i 've got a 30 minute opening on tuesday or we can do an hour long appointment on thursday . 
  we 'll need an hour if i 'm going to rough you up a bit first '', 
  a man walks into a bar . 
  his crippling alcoholism is tearing his family apart . 
  want to hear a knock knock joke ? 
  okay , you start . 
  who 's there ? 
  i used to work at the concession stand too . 
  our managers told us that people will regularly complain but also still buy it . 
  sure enough , the vast majority of people who complained would still buy food directly after .
