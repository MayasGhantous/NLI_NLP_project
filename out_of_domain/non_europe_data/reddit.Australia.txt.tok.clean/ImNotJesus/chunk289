  often , more than the average patron . 
  i also loved that they complained to me personally about it . 
  yeah , the guy earning $ 6 an hour is going to call the head of a huge company and tell him that derpy mcdeprface thinks their small popcorn is overpriced . 
  not jesus who ? 
  i think you accidentally left out a etter . 
  ** it might **, 
  this was when i was like 16 . 
  i worked for a big chain cinema ( in australia ) and they hired 12 people for a 3 month probation , first 10 at the 3 month mark . 
  i 'm a uni student so i study at work . 
  i also can use my laptop to watch movies on the weekend . 
  i think it should be ** illegal ** to sell alternative medicine . 
  at the very least , it should be ** really ** easy to sue an alternative medicine practitioner if they 're involved in someone 's death . 
  i can/will/have argue about this for days on end . 
  bring it on . 
  i was listening until, 
   dysfunction, 
  if you consider it a dysfunction then i see no chance of us seeing eye to eye on this issue . 
  i agree with this but my caveat is that we need to have good services available to help those who genuinely want to get clean to do so . 
  the only problem with that is that the bell curve is considered scientifically inaccurate by just about every psychometrics research these days . 
  recent findings into the flynn effect and how it has plateaued in western societies all but confirms it . 
  the iq disparities are much better accounted for by difference in nutrition , parental literacy and education levels . 
  basically , it said that the reason african american 's iq scores were lower than white americans is that they were genetically inferior in regards to intelligence . 
  the problem is that it 's scientifically wrong . 
  this outta be good . 
  go on . . 
  genuine question :, 
  do you also find insufficient evidence to * not * believe in unicorns ? 
  here 's a [ beautiful song about christmas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcnvzqpa-7q ) by well-known atheist tim minchin . 
  you can love the spirit of christmas while being an atheist . 
  why you * want * to believe and evidence are two different questions . 
  he was talking about evidence and i was wondering about his perspective on that . 
  make sure to serve it cold . 
  10 years ago . 
  it might have been $ 9 or something , i could be exaggerating . 
  the mistake most people make is being too obvious . 
  you want to say something more like :, 
   i just wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone for being so supportive and loving of me and my lifestyle . 
  i 'm truly touched to have so many amazing people in my life . 
  make the part you want people to believe the smallest part of the update . 
  my mother did n't love me enough, 
  listen to the first 30 seconds of hot dog by limp bizkit to find out . 
  that 's right , all of my references are completely up to date . 
  right now you feel like you 're the only one feeling what you 're feeling . 
  you 're not . 
  your experience is much like so many other people around you . 
  if you allow yourself to connect to other people and be really vulnerable , you 'll see that we 're all scared about the same half a dozen things , just worded differently and in different contexts . 
  you 're not alone and the world is a much less scary place if you reach out and connect to somebody . 
  only 80s babies will remember this . 
  like if you agree, 
  it 's funny because we hate that he makes music for a demographic that is n't us . 
  i hate when talented people make art for other people . 
  selfish cunts . 
  in regards to modern psychology , it 's a very unenlightened perspective . 
  it 's important to appreciate what you 've got and be mindful of what you have to enjoy in your life but there 's more than the 1 worst off person in the world who 's allowed to feel sad . 
  what that view does is put rules on your feelings , which there never should be . 
  the thing about feelings is that you ca n't control them , you can only control what you do in response to them . 
  so , it 's okay to feel that even though you 've got x , y and z thing that you 're not happy . 
  in fact , it 's good to notice it . 
  no good therapist would ever tell you that you should feel bad for wanting more in your life . 
  is that a thing ? 
  is one more proper than the other ? 
  just wait , i 'm going to trade in my karma for the reddit snowglobe . 
  bitches love snowglobes, 
  an inflated sense of how funny/interesting i am . 
  if the world was a better place because i was there , i 've lived a life worth living . 
  you should post a video on facebook . 
  that 's how we saved africa . 
  psychology . 
  here 's the problem , you gave us this whole long story about what you think people want from you . 
  what you should sacrifice to be good in other people 's eyes . 
  you did n't once tell us what ** you ** want . 
  of course it 's important to make sacrifices for the people you love but you ca n't live your life trying to be what you think other people want from you . 
  having had a lot of the same experiences as you ( except the illness ) , i think you 'd get a lot of benefit from talking to a therapist about this and trying to work out who ** you ** want to be . 
  sex . 
  like , it 's good and there 's nothing worse than not having it but i expected it to be ... 
  i do n't know ... more life-changing . 
  yes , you should try to find someone who is at the same stage of life as you , not someone who is chronologically the same age as you . 
  that being said ... no pedo . 
  turtle !, 
  learning to live in the present . 
  try mindfulness meditation . 
  it 's very well researched and it 's basically the best thing ever for your brain, 
  i gave you one . 
  do mindfulness meditation . 
  it really depends on the therapist . 
  mostly though , they wo n't make you move too quickly . 
  you 'll likely just give them a bit of backstory about your life and why you 're there and they 'll tell you a bit about themselves . 
  they 're not going to really challenge you too much just yet . 
  things are n't perfect but you never stop trying . 
  when i was still a virgin i had this fantasy about getting a happy ending massage . 
  so , i did some google research and found somewhere in my area that said they did it . 
  so , i drove off there and turned up . 
  turns out , it was a brothel . 
  the madame sat me down on a bed and had a series of 12 girls give me their pitch as to why i should pick them . 
  i still remember one telling me that i should pick her because she was the most sensual and that she 'd suck my balls because i looked clean . 
  i did n't end up going through with it . 
  i added to the story before you commented . 
  ninja edit hayaaa, 
  well , the madame came back in after the procession of fairly gross looking girls ( the ball sucking one was actually the hottest , i would 've picked her ) . 
  she asked me which i wanted and i was really flustered .
