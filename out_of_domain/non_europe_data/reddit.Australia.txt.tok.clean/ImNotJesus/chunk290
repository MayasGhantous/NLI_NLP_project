  she said that maybe i should go have a think and come back when i 'm ready . 
  i walked out and got the fuck out of there . 
  protip : they also discriminate based on age,

  he shorted her on the bill, 
  sounds professional . 
   over 30, 
  but, 
   soon i became fairly well known in the community, 
  and, 
   i still see them about once a month, 
  once a month for only 3 years is already more than that . 
  plus , `` still '' implies it used to be far more regular . 
   this only made the experience that much better and things kinda spun out of control until i was spending thousands a month on escorts . 
  also , i do n't think you could get well-known by making only a few reviews . 
  either he 's waaaaay under-estimating the number of girls or the story is bs . 
  louie, 
  oh , and my job . 
  i got an old job through my ex . 
  we broke up fairly amicably but we still worked together . 
  i asked my boss to move my shifts around so we were n't working together and said i was happy to do whatever . 
  he told me that he 'd been thinking about having a talk to her anyway because her availability was low and he ended up firing her . 
  i do n't know if i was responsible but i felt pretty bad . 
  it was awesome until then though , used to take our 10 minute break together to go fuck in the bathroom .

  think of willpower as an hp bar . 
  every second of every day , your every thought is on what you 're addicted to ( food , alcohol , drugs w/e ) . 
  you know logically that you do n't want it but you hp bar keeps lowering . 
  every moment you think about it , your willpower drains . 
  now , you can try to do things to help you fill back up ( time with loved ones , support , meditating etc. ), 
  but you feel the constant pressure that you 're about to run out , falling back to where you were before , only deeper this time , because there are no save games . 
  you have to start the level all over again . 
  teach people compassion and empathy . 
  how do you define greed though ? 
  a drive to achieve and want what 's best for you and your family is important . 
  well , if it does n't work in a piece of fiction we should rule it out right now . 
  that being said , his idea was stupid, 
  okay and what 's more than you need ? 
  am i allowed a 50 inch television or is my max 40 inches ? 
  how much ram is excessive on my computer ? 
  i do n't want my brain to go . 
  especially once you add in brittle bones . 
  so what 's the motivation to innovate or be a content creator ? 
  dr horrible 's sing-a-long blog, 
  you 're a dick . 
  go talk to a therapist and get help . 
  why would that mean you do n't believe me ? 
  do you think i make up stories for karma ? 
  if i were going to do that , would n't my story be much more fantastical and less embarrassing than that ? 
  `` are you sure you 're not jesus ? '', 
  after eveeeeery single one of my posts . 
  the response i want to give : `` oh wow , a joke about my username , that 's so fresh and exciting . 
  i 've never seen people do * that * before ! '', 
  i know that people do n't realise it happens over and over every day so i do n't but i * reaaaaally * want to . 
  `` if nothing we do in this world matters , then the only thing that matters is what we do . '', 
  did n't think i 'd get beaten to the punch posting an adam hills link . 
  well done .

  leatheryrainbow ... likes boys ... 
  hold on , do you make colourful leather works where you employ several young apprentices ? 
  oh wow , a joke about my username , that 's so fresh and exciting . 
  i 've never seen people do * that * before !, 
  shit . 
  thought i had that one . 
  alternative medicine . 
  i think it 's hideous , insidious and should be banned . 
  nice try , andrewsmith1986, 
  i do say pal and buddy a lot . 
  if you 're willing to work really hard and do good work , you can easily earn $ 200 an hour giving $ 10 handjobs . 
  i find that funny from the guy that ** explodes ** every time someone says `` that was n't an epic comeback '' to you . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/v15lu/epic_comebacks_gets_very_upset_when_people_say/ ), 
  banned . 
  ( that was my karmanaut impression ), 
  i did n't know about deleting internet history so my stepdad worked it out when he typed www.p and layboy.com popped up . 
  my mum and i then had a really awkward conversation about how she 's okay with it as long as i do n't `` look at anything with animals '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure i told you that story . . did n't i ? 
  the mods are ranked in order of power by how long they 've been here . 
  you can remove any mod who has been a mod for less time than you, 
  i know that i 'm smart but i do n't * feel * smart . 
  it 's not like i can see a million calculations going off in my head at all times . 
  but , i know that i can get better grades that other people by doing less work and i tend to understand things more quickly . 
  things that come hard to some come easier to me . 
  i do n't think it 's a fundamentally different experience of the world . 
  iq of 100, 
  well , no , online tests are n't that accurate . 
  also , 110-130 is 1.3 sd which is a huge range . 
  to be fair , if it 's a post about hiring a prostitute and you see my name but read anyway , you 're kind of asking for it . 
  you sound really mature and like you understand relationships well so i 'm sure this will go swimmingly . 
  ask them in a way that assumes the answer , that way they 're forced to explicitly deny you your rights ( if that 's what they 're doing ) . 
  for example ,, 
   what time should i take my lunch break ? 
  thanks for being brave enough to post this . 
  your last paragraph is completely spot on and i really wish more straight men understood that being a man does n't mean `` i want to have sex every second of every day '' . 
  plenty of unhappy relationships have been made far worse by that antiquated view . 
  sorry , not trying to make it all about the breeders but your last paragraph really resonated with me . 
  i 'm even more confused now .
