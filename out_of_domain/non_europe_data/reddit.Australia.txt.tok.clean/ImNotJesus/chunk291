  unless you were in preschool too at the time , it 's still confusing . 
  you do n't need to do this alone . 
  find a group , find a psychologist and/or find some supportive friends . 
  i 've already removed this twice . 
  post it a 3rd time and it 'll be a ban instead . 
  make small , achievable goals with real rewards after . 
  `` okay , if i finish this chapter i can spend 30 minutes playing diablo '', 
  give yourself a time-limit, 
  i found out that someone i know cheated on her ex-husband with 17 different men ( as far as i know , there were at least 17 different occasions ) . 
  i knew her well after this had all happened so to hear about it was a huge shock . 
  i feel nothing about them . 
  they 're just people trying to live their lives and they 're not hurting anyone . 
  why should i care any more than whether or not you like a finger up your ass ? 
  you 're a mexican apple thief . 
  i run the cider house . 
  i catch you hiding behind the stone mill . 
  you chase me into the tasting room . 
  oh , if there 's a crow in there : fine . 
  if not . . 
  i can live with it . 
  anyway , we 're all alone and you do n't speak a word of english , but you teach me more about hard cider than i ever learned from my fermenting exams and our passion is so loud that they can hear it all the way in the distillery . 
  i can be such an apple slut !, 
  honestly , as someone who was depressed for a few years , nothing expressed how i felt better than the movie garden state ( without all the romance stuff ) . 
  there 's some incredibly symbolism in it - looking into the empty pit , when he blends into the wall because of his shirt . 
  are you claiming that 9/11 was because america are allied with israel ? 
  wow . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  that includes your pets . 
  take it to the vet if you 're worried . 
  i had a horrible teacher in year 12 . 
  he was arrogant and belittled his students who he did n't think were smart enough . 
  he 's the person who made me realise that being smart is a very small part of what your value is as a person . 
  it really made me a better person . 
  hey !, 
  it 's that fuck_trappedinreddit guy . 
  i 'm a really big fan . 
  this is the reason we remove medical posts . 
  stupid fucking advice like alt medicine . 
  the problem with that study is the results were very bizarre ( not trusted by a lot of researchers ) . 
  the effect was only found in research that was done in germany ( i 'm pretty sure it was germany , it 's been a while since i read the study ) . 
  any way , the point is that it ** is ** alternative medicine because it is n't the usual course of treatment as the evidence is still very murky . 
  giving any medical advice over the net is stupid , hence the ban . 
  this guy has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  i was probably a bit harsh , i just get really frustrated by stuff like that . 
  so much damage is done in the name of alternative medicine . 
  talk to your doctor about it . 
  there are medical reasons to do/not do it . 
  the friendzone is n't a thing . 
  she just does n't like you in that way . 
  move on . 
  i would n't pray . 
  that being said , if i were around people praying for a sick person and they asked me to join in , i would n't say no for the sake of making a point . 
  how can you tell if someone is a vegan ? 
  [ do n't worry , they 'll tell you ] ( / spoiler ), 
  excerpt from wikipedia, 
   it is believed that prime minister jean chr\u00e9tien knocked over a maple syrup bottle but refused to apologise . 
  some say that , as this is a serious crime in canada , it was covered up to protect him from prison time . 
  [ source ] ( http://australianmuseum.net.au/drop-bear ), 
  there was actually a pretty major cover-up by the australian government . 
   the children overboard affair was an australian political controversy involving public allegations by howard government ministers in october 2001 , in the lead-up to a federal election , that sea-faring asylum seekers had thrown children overboard in a presumed ploy to secure rescue and passage to australia . 
   the government 's handling of this and other events involving unauthorised arrivals worked to its advantage . 
  the tampa affair had led the government to adopt stricter border protection measures to prevent unauthorised arrivals from reaching australia by boat . 
  polls indicated the measures had public support . 
  the government was able to portray itself as `` strong '' on border protection measures and opponents as `` weak '' . 
  in november 2001 , the liberal-national coalition was re-elected with an increased majority . 
   the australian senate select committee for an inquiry into a certain maritime incident later ** found that no children had been at risk of being thrown overboard and that the government had known this prior to the election . 
  ** the government was criticised for misleading the public and cynically '' ( exploiting ) voters ' fears of a wave of illegal immigrants by demonising asylum-seekers '', 
  do n't worry , by the next election people had forgotten about it and he ** actually won and served another term as prime minister ** . 
  it 's funny because of his username . 
  i mean , nice try , guy with yellow bottle . 
  to be fair , our pms are kind of [ known for their drinking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_hawke ), 
  basically he 's the guy that 's about to ban me because i just passed him in comment karma . 
  edit : to actually answer your question ; he banned someone from / r/iama ( where he 's the top mod ) because he accused them of spam advertising by posting their website under their popular comments . 
  there was a conspiracy theory that it was because that person had just passed him in karma ( hence my joke ) . 
  it 's tempting . 
  it 's so tempting . 
  i 'm tempted to do ama :, 
  `` i 'm the first person to pass karmanaut in karma since shitty_watercolour , ama before i get banned '', 
  if i was n't going to bed soon i 'd consider it . 
  maybe in the morning . 
  would be a good laugh before it got taken down for `` not being interesting '', 
  i 'm sure you 'll be able to read about it on subredditdrama afterwards haha . 
  tbh , given what just happened with tir , i 'm kind of scared that people will think i 'm trying to be a reddit `` celebrity '' . 
  i know regulars on askreddit know me but i 'm not that well known outside of here . 
  people will probably think i 'm just grabbing at my 15 minutes of e-fame . 
  to answer your initial question ; you heal verbal abuse the same way you would heal sexual/physical abuse that was emotionally distressing . 
  you try to work through it by support-seeking ( friends , family etc. ), 
  and problem-focussed coping ( trying to eliminate the source of the problem if it 's still occurring ) and if it 's too distressing , seeking professional help . 
  as to your story , it sounds like this guy is a fucking asshole . 
  now , if you love him and you 're willing to put up with that , it 's your choice . 
  however , you do n't have to be with someone who does n't respect you or treat you in the right way . 
  ever . 
  if you 're being this upset by his behaviour , it is completely within your rights to say that it 's not okay with you and you want out , or that he has to stop drinking/seek help/whatever your rules are ( he may not agree ) . 
  however , you 're the only one who can decide that . 
  decided to change career path from sports management to psychology . 
  best decision i 've ever made ( even though i 'll be started until i 'm over 30 ) . 
  exception : if your pizza has some form of yoghurt on it ( like a tandoori chicken pizza ) , do ** not ** microwave it . 
  the ** best ** day after meal is curry , for sure . 
  tandoori chicken pizza with a bit of yoghurt is the bomb .
