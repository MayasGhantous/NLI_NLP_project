  i once made $ 40 jumping into a freezing pool as a 13 year old . 
  my mum 's friends thought i would n't go through with it either . 
  and / r/rightsubreddit, 
  the right subreddit for all occasions . 
  then you 're not trying hard enough, 
  there 'll never be a more emotional song about death for me than, 
  [ tears in heaven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascpoozwya8 ), 
  you should try more often , it 's the main reason i 'm a mod here . 
  he 's a higher ranked mod , he could remove me if he wanted to . 
  i * was * kidding , i do n't think he would but he certainly * can * . 
  in primary school i was in the school choir . 
  the teacher asked me to mime . 
  touching myself, 
  well , i 'll worry about that in 2015, 
  yes . 
  invite me to all of your secret subreddits, 
  do n't know why people downvoted you , i was clearly joking . 
  boooooo, 
  has to be gluttony, 
  you ca n't tell me what to do , you 're not my real dad . 
  lacking divinity, 
  there are lots of constructive ways to get rid of anger that do n't involve concussions . 
   it 's not like i could just walk up to you and force you to fight me, 
  some people * do * . 
  i do n't think it should be illegal to go with a mate and punch each other a few times in a boxing ring with gloves on . 
  i do think that if you fight in public you 're endangering other people as well ** and ** i reserve the right to think you 're a fucking idiot . 
   okay , this is the part where you stop talking and just fuck ~ ~ ing swordfight ~ ~ already . 
  ftfy, 
  the quantity of it i eat . 
  have you ever eaten a deep fried mars bar ? 
  if you 're considering beer a food i think i know where the problem is . 
  i like the really cool small phenomena that affect the way people act in everyday life . 
  for examples, 
  licensing effect - when acting morally or immorally , we have an effect that acts almost like unconscious social capital . 
  so , if you act morally , you 're ** less ** likely to act moral on your next chance to act moral . 
  the reverse is also true . 
  and , it seems like this does n't just affect morality . 
  in one experiment , people that were given green ( environmental ) products were more likely to steal . 
  i think it says something about me that i had to re-read euja 's story to see that it was a guy . 
  in my head , it was a woman the ** w ** hole time . 
  edit : woops , i accidentally slipped on a freudian . 
  it 's only gay if you make eye contact, 
  open some porn , keep touching yourself until white stuff comes out . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  but , what if you could win something cool ? 
  that 's one thing we 'd have to work out . 
  any ideas ? 
  thanks !, 
  this is still a very new idea so any ideas and help co-ordinating would be appreciated . 
  we could help people set up meet-ups but that wo n't work for everyone because people live all over the world . 
  thanks !, 
  australia, 
  answer : yes, 
  if i had the power to do that i would . 
  spot on . 
  editted . 
  that 's an interesting idea . 
  we could have a subreddit-wide reward for total donation . 
  can you think of something for the non-donaters to do or a way to get involved ? 
  perhaps you can help organise or with some prizes ? 
  yeah , i do n't think selling it is legal in australia so i 'm not sure about your rules over there . 
  we can certainly add marrow donation . 
  i donated plasma yesterday . 
  apparently i can give again in 2 weeks because it 's plasma . 
  thanks beefwich, 
  once we 've got all the ideas together i 'll do an update post, 
  that 's a great idea !, 
  my partner has had malaria and she 's allowed to give plasma . 
  that 's in australia though . 
  i can ask the admins about that , not sure what 'd be involved but they may be keen . 
  did you drink lots of water beforehand and have good meals that day ? 
  hopefully !, 
  what could you do instead ? 
  what else could you do ? 
  maybe one of the prizes could be getting to abuse you or something ? 
  i have no more clout with the admins than you do . 
  yes !, 
  i could probably get karmanaut to do it too . 
  who else do people hate ? 
  i do n't plan on taking the blood myself , i 'm just trying to get people to their local centres, 
  what could you do instead ? 
  nice !, 
  i 'm a universal plasma so it 's the same with mine . 
  what could you do instead ? 
  what could you do instead ? 
  what could you do instead ? 
  what could you do instead ? 
  so we could dunk you on both of your accounts ? 
  what could you do instead ? 
  what could you do instead ? 
  awesome !, 
  do you mind posting to / r/ar _ blood_drive for me ? 
  awesome !, 
  do you mind posting to / r/ar _ blood_drive for me ?

  yes !, 
  awesome !, 
  do you mind posting to / r/ar _ blood_drive for me ?
