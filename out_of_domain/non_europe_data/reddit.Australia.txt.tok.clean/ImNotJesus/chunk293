  i think if there 's enough support we can do local meetups . 
  we could certainly have a prize for the biggest meetup . 
  they 're not going to be big prizes , more like fun prizes . 
  i 've asked him but i do n't think he 's on atm, 
  we 'll work something out for regular donaters ,, 
  i need to keep reading the other thread , please add anyone who posts in here and seems appropriate as a mod ( just press edit moderators on the right ), 
  i never said this is us only , i 'm australian . 
  mods ca n't do that . 
  melbourne, 
  me too buddy . 
  universal plasma in the hooouuuse, 
  that was my first thought . 
  i messaged s_w but i think he 's offline atm . 
  yes . 
  please do n't do that . 
  awesome , please post that in / r/ar _ blood_drive, 
  fair call . 
  i 'm the same and we 're universal plasma donors . 
  you should try to give plasma if you can . 
  that 's a cool idea . 
  awesome idea , please post it in / r/ar _ blood_drive . 
  we 'll definitely work something out, 
  i 'm glad for those people but if a bit of organising and some redditor-drawn paintings get us more donations it 's a plus . 
  southbank in melbourne . 
  clark street .

  people with experience in the industry are super helpful . 
  thank you, 
  because we could save a lot of lives . 
  well , i was in the shower and realised that i have the ability to communicate with a lot of people at once and decided that i should see if i can use that for a good cause . 
  i * did * give plasma yesterday so it 's been on my mind . 
  i do n't know , you 'd have to ask the professionals . 
  i 'm just as excited about people donating plasma/platelets !, 
  please post to / r/ar _ blood_drive . 
  i 'm getting roughly 10 messages a minute . 
  i 'll come up with a better joke later, 
  you do n't get paid for it in australia, 
  nice !, 
  promise ( you may have to remind me ), 
  awesome , please post to [ this page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ar_blood_drive/comments/vb60h/official_donation_prizes/ ), 
  it does !, 
  i 've given blood * and * plasma . 
  no ill-effects . 
  yeah , that 's why i want to keep it to fun prizes like drawings/songs from redditors and it ** will ** be prize draw stuff . 
  it would be unethical to do it with valuable things and a logistical/legal nightmare . 
  please post to / r/ar _ blood_drive !, 
  southbank in melbourne !, 
  i was clark st. we were about 5 minutes from each other !, 
  please also post that to / r/ar _ blood_drive . 
  when giving whole red blood i felt a little bit weak . 
  the weakness wore off shortly after though . 
  i really had no side-effects from the plasma . 
  feel free to x-post my message there !, 
  yes !, 
  also , you 're a universal plasma donor so you should try give that if you can, 
  if you want to help in one way or another , please post to / r/ar _ blood_drive . 
  thanks !, 
  i really was just making a joke though . 
  i 've actually defended karmanaut several times on that issue .
