  you do n't get karma for self posts . 
  also dae posts are banned on askreddit . 
  yes , we will be designing a web page for that part . 
  exactly this . 
  cops do n't choose to make marijuana illegal . 
  why would you be angry when they simply do their job and bust you for it ? 
  the ** last ** thing i want is individual cops deciding which laws to enforce and which not to . 
  ** just a friendly mod reminder **,

  it 's always better to donate . 
  think of it this way , if you 're receiving blood that is n't ab negative , it could be given to someone else . 
  also , you could still give plasma/platelets . 
  it 's definitely worth donating . 
   i 'm 22, 
  nice try . 
  i 'm not selling you booze . 
  i have the opposite problem . 
  only one friend knows me username and he wishes he could unlearn it because he keeps reading stories about me he wishes he did n't know . 
  i 'd shake your hand but ... 
  have you tried the cinnamon challenge ? 
  i had a friend in high school that you could convince to do anything if you told him that someone else could . 
  we told him that we 'd all already done it so he refused to give up until he was spasming on the floor coughing cinnamon everywhere . 
  it was basically the best day of my life . 
  decided to try online dating . 
  2.5 years later we 're still together, 
  make sure you get involved then !, 
  there will be other ways to get involved, 
  still no . 
  yes, 
  there are other ways to be involved !, 
  they can be traced back to accounts and personal info,

  hey waytoomanythrowaways ,, 
  i 'm glad you 're happy and have a plan . 
  my initial comment to you was concern because i wanted you to see a grief counsellor . 
  it was n't to make you change your mind but to make sure that you were making the decisions for the ** right reasons ** . 
  you 're completely entitled to choose not to get chemo but this is an incredibly difficult time and i just do n't want you to regret anything . 
  anyway , i hope you find help and if not , i really hope you have a wonderful time on your holiday . 
  if you have any questions about grief counselling , feel free to pm me . 
  less creepy than texting * to * a middle school girl, 
  maybe he thought computer viruses were like stds, 
  thisss !!!!, 
  like that time she tried to buy some new big jugs for the kitchen ? 
  til that my mother is relatively tech savvy for her age . 
  she can type , e-mail and has even been known to find a website . 
  i 'm mixed on this . 
  emotional health is all about balance . 
  if you spend all day focussed on your pain , you ca n't do anything to work through it . 
  conversely , if you pretend it does n't exist , you 're just as vulnerable . 
  i guess it all depends on how you define sulking . 
  if you define it as `` focussing on emotional pain to the point of incapacitation '' , then i agree . 
  if you define it as `` expressing emotion '' then i do n't . 
  at least she knows her limitations, 
  maybe she does the same thing at work and just has the most patient it department in history . 
  internet police here, 
  my mom 's wpm can beat up your mom 's wpm, 
  `` not being a pussy '' is ** terrible ** advice for someone who feels bullied . 
  it completely invalidates how you were feeling which is the exact opposite of what you want to do as a parent . 
  parents are supposed to care and understand how you feel , ** even if it 's completely irrational ** . 
  that does n't mean he should coddle you and it certainly does n't mean that he needs to pretend like it 's the worst thing in the world . 
  however , it would n't have been hard for him to actually care that you were upset instead of dismissing it . 
  edit : i find the whole thing kind of ironic too , really . 
  i love that the `` manly '' option is to ignore something instead of developing the tools to deal with it constructively . 
  it 's funny that in almost all situations , facing the situation head on is the `` manly '' thing to do but when it comes to emotions , you 're supposed to pretend they do n't exist . 
  if you could just will yourself to not have emotions , no-one would ** ever ** suffer from depression or anxiety . 
  suicide would n't exist and stress would be a thing of the past . 
  it 's not manly to pretend problems do n't exist . 
  it 's manly to decide that you 're brave enough to say `` i 'm fucking hurt right now '' because that , that takes ** real ** vulnerability . 
  just someone who is sick of guys being taught that being upset is some sort of character flaw . 
  i know that for guys in their early 20s ( the most common demographic on reddit ) it 's not going to be popular but i do n't really care . 
  my dad told my sister that she looked like a prostitute . 
  he did this at his own birthday party in front of a lot of his friends . 
  she still has n't forgiven him for that one ( there are plenty of others not to forgive him for too , do n't worry ) . 
  probably, 
  you ca n't see any problem with loudly calling your daughter a prostitute in front of a large group of people ? 
  i 'm not `` white-knighting '' , i 'm giving my opinion based on my psychology studies , having a family member who worked in anti-bullying and personal experience . 
  parents do things all the time that affects their kids in ways that they do n't understand at the time . 
  in fact , it 's basically the basis of psychology . 
  `` do n't be a pussy '' is a band-aid on a festering wound that 's only going to get worse without actual care . 
  emotions do n't just go away by deciding that you do n't want to be a pussy any more . 
  if they did , ** no one ** would ever suffer from depression or anxiety . 
  if you 're happy , i 'm happy . 
  i have no interest in telling you what to do . 
  i just want to know that you 're making decisions for the right reasons . 
  i hope you have an incredible trip . 
  i know , i must be in a terrible mood to say that cruel parenting is n't okay . 
  i do n't think it 's funny . 
  if you want to see me making jokes , look in any other thread . 
  next time , try a question . 
  which is a great message and i would 've been happy for him to say that ( although asking about how it made him feel would be a bonus ) . 
  but , closing the laptop does n't do that . 
  i never said he should sit there wallowing . 
  i 'm saying that you ca n't go straight to the other extreme either . 
  it 's about balance .
