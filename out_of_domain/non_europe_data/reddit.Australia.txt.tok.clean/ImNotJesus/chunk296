  yeah , what can you do . 
  i stand by what i said so i 'm not going to delete it . 
  hopefully it resonates with some people , even if most people dismiss it . 
  in that case , i 'm 100 % on board . 
  he did n't `` tell her that she was inappropriately dressed '' he embarrassed her , cruelly , in front of a crowd of people . 
  you do n't see any distinction ? 
  you do n't see a distinction between a parent giving their child advice and a parent embarrassing them in front of a group of adults ? 
  we 're not talking about ignoring the bully as a way to stop though . 
  we 're talking about the dad saying `` if internet bullying is upsetting you , do n't use the internet . '', 
  it 's no different to saying `` if school bullies are upsetting you , do n't go to school . '', 
  it 's not constructive in ** any way ** . 
  i love that story so much, 
  did you even read what i said ? 
  ignoring emotional issues, 
  well then i feel really sorry for your ( future ) kids, 
  when you 're a mod , there 's a little button that says `` distinguish '' . 
  all of your posts are normal , when you press `` distinguish '' it gives you the fancy green . 
  i wish i actually put the work in . 
  school was easy for me so i did less than the bare minimum ( constantly in trouble for not doing homework ) . 
  i still going into the course i wanted to but learning study skills when the work is all of a sudden hard , sucks . 
  which sub ? 
  here 's the thing about feelings , you ca n't control the fact that you have them . 
  what you can control is how you respond to them . 
  so , the first step is accepting that this is something that really sucks and it 's going to take time to deal with . 
  there 's no magic cure to stop hurting . 
  the second part is that it 's ** necessary ** to feel those feelings . 
  if deciding to just not feel things were possible/desirable , no-one would suffer from depression/anxiety/stress etc. 
  your brain is trying to tell you something . 
  it 's telling you that you 're sad right now . 
  it 's kind of like having a broken leg . 
  your brain is telling you each time you step that you should stop trying to walk because you 're just going to damage yourself further . 
  so , what do you do ? 
  you rehab your leg . 
  you do everything you can to ** heal ** your leg . 
  if you pretend that it 's not hurting , you 'll just keep walking on it and you 'll only get more hurt . 
  you heal it by talking . 
  you heal it by working through your hurt . 
  you heal it by accepting that this is just the way you feel right now and , although it 's only temporary , it 's valid to feel that way . 
  and then , when you 're ready , you 'll move on by finally grieving the loss of the relationship like you would a death . 
  you grieve what you had and you grieve what you thought you were going to have in the future . 
  no yes/no answer questions . 
  they do n't belong on askreddit . 
  well , if it 's a sincere question , it 's that we 're basically designed to think they 're the greatest thing on earth . 
  otherwise , we would n't invest the insane amount of time/energy required to raise one from birth , not to mention the high risk of death from pregnancy . 
  every part of us , from our tendency to see big eyes as cut , to the floods of oxytocin we get when our own kids are born , is there to make sure we do n't leave them outside after the first time they shit or eat them if we got really hungry . 
  i make comments on this website called reddit . 
  alternatively , get into audiobooks and podcasts . 
  i love going on an hour walk and just wandering while i learn/laugh . 
  plus , regular exercise is insanely good for your mental/physical well-being ** and ** it makes you smarter . 
  drinks are on me !, 
  ehh , you probably would n't like it . 
  yes , all emotions except for severe trauma are worth ignoring . 
  thanks !, 
  ** warning , this post may contain traces of science . 
  two cool tips on how to spend money , when you do , to gain happiness from the recent psychology research . 
  1 ) money spent on * activities * produces more happiness than money spent on * items * . 
  the reason for this is that items become less liked/useful over time . 
  conversely , we tend to embellish how good something was in our memories and you 're going to remember activities/events better than they were . 
  2 ) money spent on * other people * produces more happiness than money spent on * yourself * . 
  basically , assuming that your needs are met , you 'll gain more happiness in buying a friend a $ 10 gift than buying yourself one . 
  yeah , i know i could get more if i ever left askreddit ( 195k is from here ) but i enjoy this sub the most . 
  you 're shooting up fast . 
  i have periods like that but i ca n't maintain it . 
  it starts to become work . 
  why do you want to think i 'm sad ? 
  that 's not very nice pal . 
  why must everything i say become an extreme . 
  besides anything else , if someone is getting that upset over checkers , that 's a problem that needs dealing with anyway . 
  why would you feel ashamed that you like receiving karma ? 
  it 's a really good metric that tells you someone found you funny/interesting . 
  who would n't want to feel that way ? 
  sorry , but i 'm not sad . 
  i have a wonderful so , i 'm study for a career i 'm passionate about , i just got a brilliant new job where i 'll help lots of people and i started a blood drive on reddit that 's going to save thousands of lives . 
  things could be much worse . 
  i find it 's the most predictable , so i totally agree with your steady comment . 
  nice !,

  you do n't have to give blood to be involved , 
  i could have my life back .

  you 're the reason we 're doing it so you better make some damn funny comments on here . 
  has he spoken to a psychologist ? 
  your brother is suffering from depression . 
  it 's a stupid novelty account , pay it no attention and hopefully it will go away . 
  clearly i 'm hooked . 
  i 'll be training for a job about half of that day so i wo n't be as effective . 
  if we could do the friday instead that 'd be better . 
  seven_sins_jesus is going to sound fairly stupid and like i did it to copy you guys .

  glory just wanted to go home, 
  hate to be `` that atheist guy '' but not believing in god makes me a tiny minority . 
   majority of the world, 
  you 're at a stage in your life where you get to redefine your relationship with him . 
  you can choose the level you want him in your life . 
  if you want to spend some time with him , you can do that . 
  just make suer that you 're not spending emotional energy trying to get something he ca n't / wo n't give you .
