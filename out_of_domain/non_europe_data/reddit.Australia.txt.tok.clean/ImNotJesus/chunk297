  i get it , the atheists on here can be obnoxious but i clearly was n't trying to be in that context . 
  as someone who studies psychology ... wow . 
  on so many levels . 
  wow . 
  you genuinely have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  oh man i did n't spot that . 
  thanks for the read , that was hilarious . 
  right . 
  except that if you knew the first thing about psychology , you 'd realise that you ca n't make 100 assessments about my personality from the ( statistically correct ) belief that atheists are a minority . 
  i mean , let 's leave aside the fact that i 'm actually right for a second and focus on the fact that you spewed a paragraph of garbage based on absolutely nothing . 
  if you think that psychology is about making shit up based on your instincts about how people work , i highly recommend you stick to philosophy . 
  you have no basis for ** anything ** you said and it was all wild speculation . 
  just wow . 
  you clearly were n't joking , you were giving your honest opinion and now you 're embarrassed because you 're being called out for it . 
  yes . 
  he was clearly the villain . 
  he was trying to take over the world . 
  captain hammer was a dick but he was still clearly the hero . 
  if it 's followed by a compliment , stalk away !, 
  so was hitler . 
  just sayin ', 
  he should n't be seeing a doctor , he should be seeing a psychologist . 
  there will be a website when the time comes , we only got the ball rolling 4 days ago . 
  everything remaps your brain . 
  it 's called neuroplasticity . 
  most of the no fap people are full of shit . 
  you 're not addicted unless you get withdrawals for not using it and it affects your life . 
  where where ? 
  i have nothing to add . 
  that story was awesome . 
  for some i 'm sure it 's a dom/humiliation thing . 
  for others , it 's a way to look at cocks without feeling gay . 
  i find they get progressively worse each time when you 're doing them that fast . 
  the spelling of the word ridiculous . 
  / r/ar _ blood_drive, 
  i do n't know if i 'd call it obscure but it certainly deserves some attention !, 
  `` it happens to all guys '', 
  please do n't lie and donate again . 
  you can still be involved in lots of ways if you 've already donated and you 'll still be eligible for the draw . 
  my job just finished and i could n't be sadder . 
  i worked in a call centre where they did n't care what i did as long as i was there to answer the calls when they came in . 
  my final shift there i took 2 calls , at a total of 15 minutes on the phone out of an 8 hour shift . 
  oh , did i mention that on sundays i got paid $ 40 an hour to do that and $ 30 on saturday ?

  hey keiyakins , i understand your frustration . 
  i just wanted to mention that there will be other ways to get involved that do n't benefit the red cross in any way . 
  we 'll also be taking donations for an unrelated , secular charity . 
  we do n't want to push anyone to do something they do n't feel comfortable with . 
  this is just all about using the power of reddit to help people . 
  you mean we do n't all have to like the same things and have all the same opinions ? 
  nice try , nickelback . 
  that 's called intrusive thoughts, 
  that 's called intrusive thoughts, 
  they did n't the service ended . 
  i got paid $ 1000 redundancy . 
  a lot of call centres they give you other jobs to do if you 're only on inbound . 
  no advanced skill requirements . 
  i was taking incident reports for hospitals . 
  i literally just filled out a form . 
  also , it was a not for profit so there were huge tax benefits ( about an extra 7k a year ) . 
  i love it !, 
  used to be able to . 
  my new job wo n't give me any free time :(, 
  only 3 times , but they 've all been this year . 
  i give plasma because i 'm a universal plasma donor and it also means i can give more regularly + fewer side-effects , it just takes a while longer in the chair . 
  aluminium foil on teeth . 
  just sitting there chewing . 
  because i did n't do enough to keep them happy . 
  well , that 's what 4 year old me thought anyway . 
  which half ? 
  having something inserted into my pee-hole . 
  i 've had a cotton-bud ( q-tip ) once , it was the worst experience of my life . 
  i think so . 
  basically , because the role was ending and they had no legal reason to fire me , they have to pay me money . 
  getting laid more = / = higher production of offspring in a world where the vast majority of sex is done with no chance of reproducing . 
  uhh yes it does, 
  it 's not debatable , it 's explicitly against the rules . 
  considering one of the 6 total words in the picture is `` staked '' , surely one of the thousands of pictures of her with a stake in her hand would 've been better . 
  vampire killing, 
  cool hat, 
  that slave thing . 
  in that order . 
  i do n't hate stupid people . 
  i hate people who celebrate ignorance and anti-intellectualism .

  cd key ? 
  so brave, 
  similar to bullying , i 'm very , very against corporal punishment from parents . 
  the research says that it does n't work ^ 1 and i find it really upsetting . 
  not telling anyone what to do or not do , just saying that i find it ** really ** upsetting . 
  1 - [ here ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) is a link to the biggest meta-analysis on the topic . 
  basically it shows that not only does corporal punishment not actually change behaviour ( immediate compliance but no long-term behaviour change ) it also has a tonne of negative mental health outcomes like increased aggression , poor parent-child relationship and higher rates of mental illness . 
  i 've never seen yolo outside of reddit . 
  i 'm not sure whether i have smarter friends or it does n't actually exist . 
  people who drive 10 under the speed limit but do n't let you pass them or people who speed up finally when you 're in the process of passing them .
