  it 's just the way the system works . 
  not sure if you know but when a post/comment is reported , a small box comes up underneath that post/comment ( that relies on us seeing it ) and it also comes up in the modqueue ( a page where we can see that sort of stuff ) . 
  the modqueue is n't being checked 24/7 and we ca n't always physically see the posts getting reported ( especially if it 's a comment inside a post ) . 
  plus , people report for all sorts of stupid reasons + accidents . 
  when the mods receive a message , we see straight away ( like receiving a pm ) so between all the mods , one of us are likely to see it pretty quickly . 
  i worked with a girl ( she was 21 ) that did n't know what the holocaust was, 
  because the key to drama is uncertainty . 
  if you know what 's going to happen , there 's no uncertainty . 
  when i was 10 i was at a bat mitzvah and fainted because i was trying to show off my helium voice . 
  i inhaled an entire balloon and instantly fell to the ground . 
  from my perspective , things went all purple and then i was opening my eyes on the floor . 
  to be fair , there 's a big difference between assault , robbery and hate crimes and making a few mistakes in your life . 
  your condescension was fairly unnecessary . 
  ask ** him ** . 
  not all men are the same . 
  we have no idea . 
  it 's because they 're too busy in the kitchen amirite guys ? 
  no but i think my uncle may wonder that . 
  any ideas ? 
  it 's a 7 . 
  definitely a 7 on the international universal racism meter . 
  when i was learning to use apostrophe 's . 
  yes . 
  yeah just knock a few out and learn your lesson a couple of decades later . 
  live and let live . 
  i have no idea what you fixed but you screwed up the one in your title . 
  there 's no way to fix it now . 
  you must live with your shame . 
  i rule with an iron banhammer . 
  acting like ... you know ... knocking out a few gay guys ... 
  just 400g of 00 flour , 3 largish eggs . 
  make a well with the flour and put the 3 cracked eggs in the middle . 
  break down the eggs with your fingers while slowly folding through the flour . 
  it 's messy but it 's way easier to adjust as you go if you do it by hand . 
  please do n't take medical advice from people over the internet . 
  it 's really , really , really , really , really stupid, 
  i just try to assume whether i do/don ' t like someone based on what upvote score they 're on . 
  you 're quite green so i assume that i like you . 
  people have some really odd tags for me . 
  it 's funny because i get constant questions like `` why do i have you tagged as liking bestiality ? '' . 
  i generally know the answer but leave them wondering . 
  you 're now tagged as `` upvotes me '', 
  my life now has meaning . 
  you were wrong mom , i * am * worth loving . 
   this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  given that our hard drive could only keep a few kilobytes on it , space was always at a premium . 
  i had an epiphany that when i play games , i only ever use the file that says . exe so i just deleted all the others since they were unnecessary . 
  saved so much space !, 
  i gave my cousin 8 stitches in his chin from a pillow fight . 
  i think we can agree that i won . 
  what a terrible , terrible joke . 
  to be clear , that paper looked at the difference between implicit and explicit beliefs . 
  it basically showed that if your parents raise you to have strict beliefs about what is/isn ' t okay , you 're more likely to deny who you are as a person . 
  so , kids that did n't receive unconditional positive regard from their parents ( being loved irrespective of their personal traits ) and were also gay and from homophobic parents , were less likely to be out of the closet and more likely to display homophobia themselves . 
  it said nothing about the prevalence of homosexuality , only the prevalence of homophobia in homosexuals . 
  note : i study psychology and volunteer in suicide prevention, 
  ** to people who have friends/family who are suicidal ** :, 
  i 'd just like to add that you need to remember that if your friend is suicidal , you 're not qualified to handle the situation and should n't feel like it 's your ** responsibility ** . 
  if you have a friend who you believe to be suicidal or depressed , they need ** professional ** help . 
  of course , your love , support and care will greatly help them but your number one priority is to get them to call someone who can help them long term . 
  support them in getting help by offering to call someone for them or even offering to pick them up from their first appointment . 
  help is out there , do n't try to take it all on by yourself . 
  ** to people that feel depressed/suicidal ** :, 
  the first and most important thing to remember is that you 're not alone . 
  many other people have felt as low and helpless as you do right now and they 've come out the other side . 
  all feelings come and go with the passage of time and there 's no reason to believe that what you 're feeling right now will last forever . 
  i ca n't promise it will be easy but if you keep fighting this wo n't last forever . 
  i 've been where you are and i know that it feels all-encompassing . 
  it feels like you ca n't imagine a world where things are different . 
  i made it through and my life is better than it 's ever been . 
  i 'm not more special/deserving than you . 
  keep fighting , get the ** right ** help and these feelings will pass . 
  edit : a lot of people are saying that it 's simply because the economy is bad . 
  while i 'm sure money is a factor , the evidence shows that money is n't anywhere near as linked to happiness as we think it is . 
  i 'm sure that struggling for money adds a lot of stress/anxiety and that makes things worse but no-one is suicidal `` just '' because of the economy . 
  i wish i could could downvote your 1st and 3rd paragraph but upvote your 2nd . 
  edit : to be clear about why : your first paragraph may be right or how you feel but that last thing a suicidal person needs is more guilt/anger about how they feel . 
  no-one chooses to feel that way and you do n't find yourself in that position easily or because you 're making a rational choice . 
  with your third paragraph , you * may * be right that on * some * occasions people are doing it for attention . 
  you know what , i 'll take the risk and help someone if it may be the difference between them seeking therapy and not . 
  as for suicidewatch , i think they 're generally caring , nice people . 
  however , mental health , especially at that severity , needs to be dealt with by professionals . 
  support is important but there is n't anywhere near enough push to get people to real help . 
  you do n't see the hundreds of unpopular posts we remove every day . 
  we try to moderate everyone fairly . 
  that 's all that happened in this case , we did n't give op special treatment . 
  i study psychology and volunteer in suicide prevention . 
  i agree that it 's an important cause but those hundreds of charity drive posts we remove are also posted by people who think it 's an important cause . 
  you should n't think of it as more or less `` extreme '' . 
  having someone you care about being suicidal is an incredibly challenging thing . 
  you do n't need to qualify it , what you went through/are going through is really tough . 
  just make sure you do n't forget to keep taking care of yourself while you 're supporting her . 
  begging , reasoning and arguing are n't useful tactics . 
  much more valuable is listening , support and care . 
  there 's an idea in neuroscience called the dual process model . 
  it basically suggests that thinking is on two different levels - emotional and reasoning ( this has been fairly well accepted in psychology for years but it 's being formalised in neuroscience recently ) . 
  if you ever been in an argument with an emotional partner , you realise that while they 're emotional , the reasoning parts of their brain do n't work so well . 
  first you have to disengage the emotion . 
  you do that by listening , supporting and caring .
