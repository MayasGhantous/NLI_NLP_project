  once they feel safe and heard , you 're much more likely to be able to reason . 
  that 's not to say that all people will agree to get help at that point but you 'll be much closer than if you try to argue them into that position . 
  yes but i would ** much ** rather that be done by trained professionals . 
  you ca n't take care of her if you 're not taking care of yourself , physically ** and ** emotionally . 
  make sure you have someone ** you ** can talk to about it , be it therapist or friend . 
  also , thanks ?

  in most areas you can find a database if you simply type `` find a therapist [ x area ] '' into google . 
  note : happy to add more if you have more links . 
  it 's important to find a therapist that fits you as well . 
  sometimes it 's not just a case of one being `` good '' or `` bad '' but more a style mismatch . 
  for another question , [ i wrote quite an extensive write-up about the misconceptions in psychology ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/utthk/scientists_of_reddit_what_misconceptions_do_us/c4yhbwd ) . 
  within that , i wrote a bit about the four most common types of therapy :, 
  ** as requested ** - here 's a quick run down of 4 of the major types of therapy ( the ones i know best ) . 
  please note that most ( good ) therapists will use a * combination of tools * derived from the different therapies . 
  they 're all effective in different ways and for a few disorders , similarly effective . 
  however , some are the preferred treatment for specific mental illnesses . 
  also , if you 're a practitioner , please message me if any of my points need clarification . 
  * cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) - cbt is focussed on adjusting maladaptive thought patterns . 
  the idea is essentially that maladaptive thought patterns ( ones that do n't conform to reality and cause disruptive behaviour ) exist because of a feedback loop . 
  the therapist and patient will attempt to break this loop by ** reality testing ** ideas to see if they 're true or just a product of maladaptive thought . 
  this reduces the emotion attached to them , thereby reducing maladaptive thinking the next time . 
  for example , your friend cancels lunch with you and you get upset . 
  you would write down all of the possible reasons they cancelled `` they do n't really want to be my friend any more '' , `` i 'm not interesting enough '' and try to work out whether they 're `` true '' or simply a product of distortion . 
  * psychodynamic psychotherapy - this is the modern version of freud 's psychoanalysis . 
  the focus is on creating a therapeutic alliance wherein the patient is able to explore his/her past . 
  in doing this , the unconscious reasons for behaviour can be uncovered . 
  for example , the patient may be upset due to a series of bad relationships . 
  they would try to look at what they 're lacking from their past or what needs they 're trying to fulfill that are leading to back decisions . 
  please note : although this is linked to freud , the evidence says that it ** does ** work . 
  one can practice psychodynamics without accepting the psychosocial stages of development or other outdated analytical concepts . 
  * acceptance and commitment therapy ( act ) - act is about creating acceptance for who you are and your situation in life . 
  it focusses on retraining you to be happy with where you 're at , instead of fighting to feel a certain way or be at a certain place . 
  this is thought to lead to psychological ** flexibility ** and a better ability to be present in the moment . 
  * mindfulness based stress reduction ( mbsr ) - mbsr is essentially a therapy based on mindfulness . 
  meditation is magnificent and has been shown to drastically reduce anxious/depressive symptoms .

  they have information on the research and some guided meditations to try . 
  a few minutes a day will actually cause physical changes in your brain . 
  hey , you_made_me , that sounds like a really horrible position to be in . 
  are you talking to a psychologist about these concerns ? 
  alright , glad to hear you 're taking better care of yourself . 
  if you need a good vent and do n't have any friends you can talk to about it ( for whatever reason ) , feel free to pm me . 
  thanks , that 's kind of you to say . 
  hey , i 'm not judging , was just wondering where you 're at . 
  do you mind me asking what you * are * able to do at the moment to help yourself get through this ? 
  and what are you doing to take care of your mental health ? 
  are you getting regular exercise ? 
  meditating ? 
  have you tried books on cbt or act ? 
  have you tried getting counselling through the college where you 're taking classes ? 
  i 'm not judging you , just wanting to help because there are resources available . 
  genuinely , for me , yes . 
  i 'm so much happier than i was before my depression . 
  the way i saw it was that i had the opportunity to completely tear myself down and start fresh . 
  i did n't need repairs , i basically need a total overhaul . 
  so , piece by piece i worked on myself and i 'm unrecognisable from the person i was before my depression . 
  i live with my amazing partner , i study something i 'm passionate about , i have a fulfilling job and some great friends . 
  i could n't imagine having all of that as a jobless , aimless , virgin , depression sufferer . 
  no way . 
  you have to remember that not only does the depression make you feel like right now is hopeless , it makes you feel like the future is hopeless too . 
  you ca n't imagine feeling any different to how you do right now . 
  i ca n't promise you that it will be worth it for you but i can swear that it was worth every single bit of upset to be where i am now . 
  thanks lancasters . 
  i 'm just trying to tell people what i wish i knew back then . 
  honestly , i think that by all objective measures we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  in no time in history has violence been lower or has access to education , health care and equality been higher . 
  i understand why you feel hopeless and helpless in this all of a sudden very connected world . 
  but , i think that how you feel right now is affecting your ability to judge the world objectively . 
  i get it , i 've been there , but the world will be just fine . 
  do you mind me asking what you 're doing to combat your situation ? 
  are you in therapy ? 
  as an ignorant post hater i agree with this, 
  in your experience . 
  the stats say that a large percentage of people who seek therapy get through depression . 
  do you mind me asking what interventions you 've sought ? 
  i may be able to help you find more resources . 
  because no-one makes a healthy , rational decision to kill themselves . 
  there are other kinds of help out there . 
  unfortunately , suicide prevention hotlines are stretched to the limit . 
  you saw a quack . 
  there 's absolutely no evidence that eating meat is related to depression . 
  however , meditation can be incredibly helpful . 
  it sounds like it was n't the right kind of approach for you though . 
  [ have a read of this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/wm35b/cop_here_i_have_seen_a_large_increase_in_suicides/c5ei6l6 ) . 
  given what you said about your social anxiety , cbt would probably make the most sense . 
  sorry to hear that . 
  i get what that 's like . 
  you feel like if you can just force yourself into a situation that makes other people happy , it will magically make * you * happy . 
  i wish it worked that way . 
  it sounds like your social anxiety combined with the pressure you put on yourself to feel a certain way makes things really tough for you . 
  i 'm sorry that you 're in that position but i strongly believe that it 's a manageable issue , especially given your clear insight and willingness to challenge yourself . 
  try to find a cbt therapist or even just buy a cbt manual off of amazon . 
  that 's a completely different discussion . 
  you know , there was a brilliant study a couple of months ago that looked at homosexuals from families that were homophobic and found that they were very likely to also be closeted and homophobic if they did n't receive unconditional positive regard ( the belief that their parents would love them no matter what ) . 
  it sounds like that 's where a lot of this came from for you . 
  as for your second paragraph , i get where you 're coming from . 
  when i was depressed , i felt like i did n't `` deserve '' to be depressed .
