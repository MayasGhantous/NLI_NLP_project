  like my life was too good to justify it . 
  you feel how you feel , you ca n't change that . 
  what you can change is what you do about it . 
  speak to a psychologist and challenge those views about yourself . 
  you deserve to be happy and love yourself . 
  there are some terrible therapists out there . 
  ask my girlfriend , i still do this ** all the time ** . 
  it 's a really hard habit to break , especially because as soon as she gets upset , i get anxious and fall into my own defences ( being hyper-rational and unemotive ) . 
  you can definitely get better with practice though . 
  thanks !, 
  i can choose whether to make my post green or not . 
  you 're missing on big thing . 
  your need to be perfect is also a feedback that you need to counter . 
  i 've gone through/am going through a similar thing . 
  i 'm a smart guy too . 
  i was always told how smart i was as a kid and put incredible pressure on myself to be the best at everything all the time . 
  you know what though , that belief is a really good way of making sure you never let yourself be vulnerable . 
  it stops you ever really being a part of the world because you 're never really a part of it . 
  i see a psychodynamic psychotherapist and we work on challenging * why * i feel like i always have to be perfect . 
  even right now , i 'm trying to stop myself from attempting to totally take over this thread because i 'll become obsessive about it . 
  the point is , i get wanting to be perfect but that 's actually a really unhealthy way to live your life . 
  it comes from fear of being incomplete or unworthy . 
  i do n't live in the us myself but you could try local colleges , they may have supervised students doing therapy . 
  also , you could talk to her about meditation . 
  the evidence says that it works very well . 
  i was depressed for about 4/5 years but that really depends on what you consider the starting/end point to be . 
  i still get therapy because it 's now helping me create a life full of meaning . 
  i 'm sorry you did n't get much out of your therapy . 
  is it possible that you went to one that did n't really match your needs/personality well ? 
  there are lots of different types . 
  because ... ? 
  well , mbsr is taught very extensively at my university ( top 10 in the world ) and i know many practising therapist that use both it and act . 
  just a little button that says distinguish . 
  ca n't you see how using your effort sporadically puts you in an even worse position though ? 
  i 'm certainly not pushing you to do anything , i 'm just encouraging those who need help to seek it . 
  if you 're happy the way you are , that 's your call . 
  i certainly am not advocating a `` magic cure '' though . 
  therapy is hard work . 
  i 'm just saying that different types of therapy appeal to different kinds of people , that 's all . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  we 're hard-wired to think that our parents know best . 
  then , they give us their opinion our whole childhood when we 're not old enough to understand what 's right/wrong . 
  it makes total sense that a part of brain agrees with them and makes it hurt like hell to be who you are . 
  but , you sound like you 're working through that and that 's amazing !, 
  do you think you could talk all of this through with a psychologist ? 
  thanks pal , i like you too . 
  that sucks , sorry . 
  in australia the insurance/medicare coverage is much better . 
  still , it 's been worth every cent i 've spent . 
  since when is america the world ? 
  sorry , i do n't know much about the system there so i ca n't be of more help . 
  short-term helpers if she 's willing though are : regular exercise , meditation and she can buy books that will teach her cbt or act and how to use them on herself . 
  you could offer to buy one and work through it with her if she 's willing . 
  sorry , i 'm not saying that you should never try . 
  i 'm saying that with an `` all or nothing '' mentality where perfection or not trying are the only options , you 're setting yourself up for disappointment . 
  i get it , i do it too , but it does n't work . 
  there 's no way to possibly be happy . 
  i get that . 
  it 's tough . 
  i 'm lucky that the first psychologist i tried was the right one for me . 
  let me know if you need any support and pm me any time . 
  no sir, 
  if you ever speak to a therapist who makes you feel like they do n't understand you , leave . 
  i 'm sorry , that was n't what i was trying to say at all . 
  i 'm not saying you can will yourself into happiness , i was challenging the efficacy if your approach because i 've done the same for my whole life and been burned by it . 
  please do n't mistake this for me minimising your pain . 
  a ) i 'm not from the same country as you, 
  b ) i 'm giving my personal opinion on the * type * of therapy that may appeal to his personality . 
  i never tried to diagnose or treat him . 
  i gave no medical advice at all . 
  except that i was exactly where you are and words * did * help me . 
  there was n't one magical phrase that all of a sudden fixed me but the waves of help slowly eroded how i was feeling . 
  i know there is n't an easy answer . 
  i wish there was . 
  but you 're not necessarily going to feel that way forever . 
  thanks , i appreciate that . 
  i went through a bunch of therapy . 
  worth every cent . 
  i think because when you do n't have people in your life who really understand how you feel , it 's nice to know that you 're not crazy for feeling that way . 
  that may be your experience but that 's not true for everyone . 
  hey , i 'm not sure why you 're getting so angry at me . 
  i 'm just sharing my personal experience . 
  i never guaranteed it for everyone . 
  but , it 's more than a lucky few . 
  the majority of depression sufferers who complete therapy are no longer depressed . 
  you seem angry . 
  dbt is largely a combination of the others . 
  thanks, 
  even after 5 years of therapy , my biggest issue is living in the present . 
  as an anxious/neurotic person it always will be . 
  but , it 's certainly gotten ** much ** better . 
  school psychologists are a mixed bag . 
  some are good , some are terrible . 
  for depression , therapy is the ** best ** answer by a big margin . 
  however , you can reduce anxious/depressive symptoms with exercise , meditation and there are books available for teaching yourself cbt/act . 
  the evidence says that they both help but they 're certainly not solutions . 
  they reduce symptoms but if you 're depressed , you should be speaking to a professional .

  so happy to hear that .
