  i 'd wonder why my dream went into such graphic detail of me masturbating thousands of times, 
  why would you tell her anything ? 
  you just found out that a friend is n't worthy of being your friend . 
  just cut that cunt out of your life .

  did you push * her * off ? 
  gone in 60 seconds, 
  edit : also , blow or behind enemy lines, 
  wait ... you 're getting upset because you want to have an argument with someone and they do n't want to get into one with you ? 
  how old are you ? 
  but if you 're pro choice does n't that mean you 're pro-baby death ? 
  talking to a psychologist about it, 
  just adding more answers !, 
  my first was still my funniest i think .

  at least it 's not 2 fast 2 furious, 
  [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-55wc5denc ) from louie is great . 
  steven novella writes an excellent blog on science-based medicine . 
  [ here ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/does-acupuncture-work-or-not/ ) is his article on acupuncture . 
  he has newer articles about more recent studies too . 
  tl ; dr acupuncture does n't work . 
  did n't think people would miss that one , apparently i was very wrong . 
  [ neuroscience of free will ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuroscience_of_free_will#the_libet_experiment ) on wikipedia has a good write-up of some of the really important experiments on this topic . 
  i do n't want to click , how bad is it ? 
  trying to work out if i should ban, 
  just finished my psychology bachelors . 
  hoping to do this while i complete my masters and phd . 
  thanks for the kind words . 
  it 's certainly going to be challenging but the program is just incredible . 
  so this is not me but a girl i know . 
  her dad remarried ( after her mom ) and had 2 kids with a girl aboutt he same age as his first daughter . 
  they then break up but continue living together for the sake of the kids . 
  it then comes out that while they were in the process of breaking up , she 'd been contacting his brother ( who lives in another state ) and they had a thing going . 
  after initially being pissed off , the dad decides to forgive his brother and now ex-wife . 
  so much so that when the uncle/mother decide to move in together , he ** stays in the same house ** . 
  that 's right , he currently lives with his ex-wife , his brother who his wife cheated on him with and the 2 kids .

  a guy i went to school with , and was friends with until that moment , started telling me that he wished that hitler `` did a better job at killing all the jews '' . 
  i was jewish at the time . 
  haha i re-wrote that sentence 4 times , not sure how to say it . 
  there was an alt-medicine-y psychic-y one recently that got slaughtered . 
  yeah , do more than one neuropsych lecture on concussions and you wo n't let your kids play contact sports . 
  apparently , saying that the psychology research suggests that not only is corporal punishment an ineffective strategy , it has many negative outcomes , makes me the enemy of most of reddit . 
  it 's probably better to ask how often i 'm not masturbating, 
  settle down , she was n't being judgy , she answered the question . 
  someone is projecting . 
  `` slow down , you crazy child, 
  you 're so ambitious for a juvenile, 
  but then if you 're so smart , tell me, 
  why are you still so afraid ? 
  where 's the fire , what 's the hurry about ? 
  you 'd better cool it off before you burn it out, 
  you 've got so much to do and, 
  only so many hours in a day, 
  but you know that when the truth is told . . 
  that you can get what you want or you get old, 
  you 're gon na kick off before you even, 
  get halfway through, 
  when will you realize , vienna waits for you ? 
  slow down , you 're doing fine, 
  you ca n't be everything you want to be, 
  before your time, 
  although it 's so romantic on the borderline tonight, 
  tonight , ... 
  too bad but it 's the life you lead, 
  you 're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need, 
  though you can see when you 're wrong , you know, 
  you ca n't always see when you 're right . 
  you 're right, 
  you 've got your passion , you 've got your pride, 
  but do n't you know that only fools are satisfied ? 
  dream on , but do n't imagine they 'll all come true, 
  when will you realize , vienna waits for you ? '',

  mindfulness is medicine . 
  is has 10 years of incredible data showing how well it works . 
  something does n't need to be a pharmaceutical to be called medicine .

  tl ; dr spanking is bad . 
  less spanking is less bad . 
  it 's not just that there 's no evidence it works , but there 's evidence that it does harm . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you mean by how does it work with bpd . 
  many mental illnesses have very high rates of co-morbidity and the presentation of one condition is n't always the same , let alone the combination of two . 
  if you 're concerned that you have either condition , or have already been diagnosed with either , this is really a conversation to have with a psychologist and/or psychiatrist in person . 
   this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  call the cops . 
  no problems . 
  it 's not a suitable post for askreddit . 
  i 'm sorry for what you 've been through . 
  the 10 % of your brain thing is silly because the vast majority of your brain is n't for cognition ( thinking ) .
