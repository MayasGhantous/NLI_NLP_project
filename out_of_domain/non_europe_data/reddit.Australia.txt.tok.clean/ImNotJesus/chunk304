  there 's also sometimes an implication that using more than 10 % would be desirable and if we could `` unlock '' 100 % of our brain we 'd be able to achieve incredible things ( think the movie limitless ) . 
  yeah , using 100 % of your brain at the same time is called a seizure . 
  parts of your brain send excitatory signals , the other parts send inhibitory . 
  doing everything at once is very much undesirable . 
  a lot of terrible guesses in this post . 
  it would be impossible to tell you based on what you 've said . 
  if you 're very keen to find out more , you 'd want to speak to a ** neuro ** psychologist as they are experts in this sort of thing . 
  my apologies , it was actually a top 10 entry , not necessarily the winner . 
  the rest of the top 10 can be found [ here ] ( http://australianmuseum.net.au/2012-eureka-prize-science-photography ), 
  much lower . 
  i would have thought that very few people switched affiliations . 
  have surgery in a better country . 
  dtma, 
  / r/kitchenconfidential, 
  you left out about 20 relevant pieces of information there . 
  the level of the amateur , the type of poker , the blinds , the amount of money behind them , how many rounds they play for etc. 
  would all make a huge difference . 
  also , if you played enough times amateurs would beat professionals on some occasions . 
  there is a certain amount of luck in poker as you do n't always make the right decision , you make the statistically most probably to win you the hand decision . 
  if you make right decisions and get unlucky you can lose but play flawlessly . 
  also , a pro did this online and did quite well never looking at his cards . 
  [ denis dutton : a darwinian theory of beauty ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pktuzdnbqwi ), 
  i have n't read a lot of the research on team sports in particular but my reading on in-groups would suggest that the initial decision to support a team is somewhat arbitrary ( parents support them , location , player you like etc. ), 
  but in-group biases maintain and bolster that support . 
  one of the first really field-changing studies on in-group bias was done at a series of camps for your kids ( i think all boys ) , set up to look at how groups interact . 
  they put the kids into different groups to see how they would see the members of their own groups and others . 
  they found that even if you ** show all the participants that which group they are placed in is completely arbitrary ** ( from memory , they showed all the kids a drawing out of a hat to pick groups ) they will still show strong biases towards their team members and against the other team . 
  the evolutionary basis for this is obvious . 
  it makes a lot of sense for us to be hard-wired to stick within our group and believe it to be right/smarter/stronger and see other , potentially threatening groups , as wrong/dumber/weaker . 
  the other element i 'd throw into the mix is that of sunk cost . 
  a team you 've supported over the years has seen considerable emotional investment from you . 
  people are notoriously bad at giving up things they 've already invested in , even if it is practical/logical to do so ( like supporting a local team ) . 
  lastly , consider cognitive dissonance . 
  if you 're not aware , it 's basically the idea that we unconsciously chance our perception of dissonant factors so that there is no incongruity . 
  for example , i like x band but you do n't . 
  they make a new song that is widely considered to be neither good or bad . 
  i 'm * likely * to see the song as good because i unconsciously want it to fit with my previously held beliefs . 
  conversely , you are * likely * to see it bad for the same reasons . 
  the same effect could be applied to supporting a sporting team . 
  ever wonder why both team 's supporters think the referees are against * their * team ? 
  that 's cognitive dissonance . 
  we apply all sorts of unconscious adjustments to our perceptions , in order to maintain our view . 
  so , my answer to you is that the team itself is largely irrelevant . 
  once you * start * supporting a team , there are a lot of psychological forces that hold that belief in place . 
  so you think that someone who is ignoring the opportunity to post again and hit the front page again , will now do so for a tiny fraction * more * attention ? 
  again , i 'm not opposed to the idea but we have a blanket no against flair because it tends to get out of hand . 
  i would personally want to see a very compelling reason before offering it to someone . 
  but , if it was widely supported , i 'd have no issue . 
  i agree about the media blame . 
  on some issues there is simply an objectively right and objectively wrong answer . 
  why is n't a climate change denier openly mocked on the news ? 
  why do we allow politicians to talk about equal rights like it 's a matter of personal opinion ? 
  i do n't know , maybe i 've been watching too much newsroom but i 'm pretty ready for the media to actually stand up and call bullshit a bit more often . 
  yeah , the problem is that having gillard on gets people to listen and if you ambush her with difficult questions , she does n't come back on . 
  not to single her out , any other pm would do the exact same thing . 
  it 's not like there 's a shortage of people who want her on their show , she can easily just go on the ones where she gets lobbed softballs . 
   did this guy even read the judgement ? 
  it had nothing to do with the `` separation between church and state '' . 
  it had to do with the federal government 's funding powers . 
  to be fair , both can be true . 
  yes , the decision was on funding grounds but his point that the policy is largely motivated by a desire to please large interest groups is still true . 
  you can easily make the argument that if that were n't the case , the largely unpopular policy would n't have been re-instituted immediately . 
  she 'd be so relieved to hear that . 
  it 's funny because i 've seen this gif posted several times in that exact context . 
  really ? 
  andrew posts all the time . 
  i 've said too much . 
  my dad taught me to be nothing like him if i want to have a happy and fulfilling life . 
  you 'll have plenty of chances to party in your life , you 'll never get a better opportunity to learn . 
  i 'm not saying you should n't have fun , just do n't let it get in the way of what you 're there to do . 
  that 's a good life rule in general . 
  learn from this mistake and not loan money to `` friends '' in the future . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_psychology ), 
   i know him very well though and am pretty sure that he is at a strip club right now . 
  why are you with someone you * expect * to lie to you ? 
  i 've removed this post because it has a lot of personally identifying information in it which is explicitly against the rules . 
  i ca n't stop you from posting it elsewhere but i really recommend you be more careful with the personal information you give out on the internet . 
  ** if you want to be friends **, 
  q1 ) are you completely over her ? 
  if yes , wait a month and then call . 
  if no , wait a month and then see question 1, 
  ** if you just want closure **, 
  you can call her any time , just do n't expect to like your answers or get back together . 
  this answer is good . 
  i just want to add that there is clear evolutionary benefit in proving to other tribe members that you 're part of the tribe and share the same values in a hunter gatherer situation . 
  social psychology has shown very clear in-group bias and it 's believed that it exists to maintain and strengthen the group dynamic , which is essential for survival . 
  you * now * realise that ? 
  [ here you go op ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3a+irony ), 
  it 's about as ironic as rain on the day that arbitrarily happens to be your wedding . 
  my dad does this weird thing where he acts like a total fucking asshole . 
  to start with , you * are * an atheist by the dictionary definition . 
  you may call yourself whatever you want though . 
  in short , i think religion offers easy answers to hard questions and i understand why people like it . 
  it 's not for me and i think there 's a great happiness available too you if you challenge those easy answers but each to their own . 
  1 ) that 's not his idea, 
  2 ) it 's an unproveable and untestable notion that has no effect on my day to day life , so i feel no need to concern myself with the possibility . 
  1 hour before your interview you 're going to sit down with a pen and paper and just start writing . 
  anything that comes into your head , just write it down . 
  this has been shown to improve performance under pressure . 
  next , if you start to feel yourself getting anxious , i just want you to sit there and breathe slowly .
