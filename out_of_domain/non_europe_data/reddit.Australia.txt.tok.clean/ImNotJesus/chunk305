  meditation is n't supernatural . 
  it thickens areas of the brain that it activates and has been studying extensively . 
  there 's nothing mystical going on , just something valuable being found in religion . 
  also , fmri shows areas of the brain that have more blood flow in them . 
  the article simply shows that they 're not consciously choosing to act in that way , it says nothing about * why * they 're acting in that way . 
  a psychological answer is still ** far ** more likely than a supernatural one . 
  anything else ? 
  as a non-american , i get downvoted ** very ** heavily for saying that having more guns available does n't seem to reduce gun violence . 
  you 're going to get a lot of people telling you that they need guns because the bad guys have guns . 
  it 's funny how there does n't seem to be the same need in countries that do n't have almost no gun control .

  history shows that quite well . 
  well , for one , you 're missing out on potential partners by making a judgement that , you consider yourself , to be inconsistent with how you actually see the world . 
  also , if that inconsistency is there , how else is it effecting you ? 
  are you making other judgements of men for bad reasons ? 
  what are the reasons behind those beliefs ? 
  these questions could all lead you to a happier place .

  you know there are words for when someone pulls your shirt up when you tell them not to right ?

  i do n't know what you mean , [ jim wallace is a brilliant , insightful and articulate man ] ( http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2011/04/25/1226044/435775-wallace.jpg ), 
  ( [ that was on anzac day last year ] ( http://www.news.com.au/features/anzac-day/jim-wallace-from-australian-christian-lobby-causes-anzac-day-outrage-with-anti-gay-anti-muslim-twitter-message/story-e6frfldi-1226044466591 ) ), 
  in case anyone is wondering about the science of spanking/not spanking , the [ psychological evidence ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) says that it 's not only an ineffective strategy in changing behaviour ( short-term compliance but no long-term behaviour change ) , it also has several severe negative outcomes including damage to the parent-child relationship and significantly higher rates of mental illness . 
  i 'm not telling anyone what to do , just mentioning the science . 
  edit : for some easier to read information , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asksocialscience/comments/xh36t/why_is_it_okaynot_okay_to_punish_children/ ) is a link to an / r/asksocialscience question on the topic . 
  lots of information/links to be found . 
  [ the science says that you 're wrong ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) . 
  not telling anyone what to do but to say that it 's not harmful is scientifically inaccurate . 
  no , nothing in psychology is that clear cut . 
  we 're talking about huge amounts of data that suggests that a child who is physically punished as a behaviour modification tool is more likely to have mental health issues . 
  it also says that less spanking leads to less issues . 
  to take a neil degrasse tyson phrase : the great thing about science is that it 's true whether you believe it or not . 
  there 's a reason why science exists and that 's because humans are very flawed when it comes to making claims of truth . 
  i 'm certainly not saying that all kids are parented well and the parents of kids who make other 's lives difficult at a shopping centre are n't doing the right thing either . 
  but , the evidence says that spanking simply does n't work . 
  i get that your experience of your own childhood was that it does work . 
  the science says otherwise . 
  only from the ones that could n't spell . 
  you 're both acting like children . 
  have you considered setting up a time to talk ?

  my headline is from [ this write-up ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20120808-23645.html ), 
  no-one here is claiming that correlation = causation . 
   it is possible that early cannabis exposure causes enduring mental health risks in the general cannabis using adolescent population . 
  that 's a very fair assessment from the data . 
  it is possible that the link goes that way . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're implying . 
  just in case anyone is wondering , there is a real psychology of relationships theory called [ sternberg 's triangular theory of love ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangular_theory_of_love ) . 
  the three points are intimacy , passion and commitment . 
  there are some slightly more modern versions but they 're generally pretty similar in idea .

  so you went from being a dick to a bigger dick ? 
  good personal growth pal . 
  i do n't know if i agree with you there . 
  there are plenty of people , even christians , who consider the acl to be a horrible hate group that do n't represent australians . 
  you wo n't find many experts who prescribe daily pot as a cure for anxiety . 
  alcohol ( and weed ) is a mask for anxiety , it does n't solve any issues . 
  the same could be said for prescription medication which , in my opinion , should always be in conjunction with therapy that is aimed at eliminating the medication . 
  the point is that self-medication is an incredibly dangerous thing to do because it 's not being managed by an expert . 
  drinking to mask anxiety only leaves you with an extra problem . 
  that may be true . 
  i certainly do n't mean to say that it 's a very bad political move , just that i do n't necessarily agree that it will lose her ** no ** votes,

  my granmother used to steal the little packets of condiments that they give you with breakfast at mcdonalds . 
  she has a giant jar of them in her cupboard and uses them instead of paying for jam/vegemite etc.
