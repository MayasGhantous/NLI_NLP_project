  there are two potential answers and it really depends on the person , their mental health and state of mind . 
  on one hand , it 's not abnormal to imagine upsetting situations . 
  in fact , we practice dealing with difficult situations by experience-taking during movies/shows/songs / literature etc. 
  some theorists suggest that it 's a way of developing skills to deal with those events or just emotionally preparing for an eventuality . 
  however , the behaviour becomes more of a concern when the thoughts have ( a ) a clear plan or are ( b ) intrusive . 
  for a , there 's a big difference between imagining jumping in front of a train and sitting at home considering the situation and deciding that jumping in front of a train is a good plan . 
  as for b , that refers to the ability of the thinker to * change * their thoughts . 
  so , if you 're being `` haunted by '' or have distressing thoughts of suicidal actions , that 's a different story . 
  in either of those cases , it 's what we call [ suicidal ideation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicidal_ideation ) and the sufferer should be talking to a professional at that stage . 
  on 2 , you have to remember that it takes significant effort to decelerate a swinging club by using opposing muscles . 
  all you 'd be doing is making your life much more difficult .

  evolution is about suitability to the environment . 
  anything that changes the environment influences the genes that will be passed on and therefore influence the * course * of human evolution . 
  please remember though that evolution is n't a path to a certain ultimate goal .

  psychology teaches you two different sides . 
  the broad strokes of how people are * likely * to act in certain situations and how to delve deeply in a way that will uncover specifics about * that * person . 
  just as someone who 's very active on askreddit i start a lot of my posts with `` there was a really interesting study ... '' . 
  i definitely think my studies give me a better insight into how people think but it certainly does n't mean that i can analyse someone 's whole personality from reading 5 lines of how they want to describe themselves . 
  that being said , i 've certainly recommended to many users that they seek professional mental health support .
