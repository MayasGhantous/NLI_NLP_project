  posts that claim marijuana does anything but cure cancer tend to attract a lot of downvotes . 
  hey , might sound like a pedant here but you ca n't really have a `` small case of ocd '' about one particular topic . 
  it 's not ocd in that case , it 's just you being obsessive about a particular topic . 
  ocd is pervasive and persistent and not context specific . 
  i say this because you do n't hear people say that they have a small case of cancer some days . 
  having ocd is nothing like your small , containable compulsion . 
   literally any crap a salesman throws at her, 
  i do n't think you know what the word literally means .

  sorry , it was just a really funny phrase . 
  as an australian , i find it horrifying . 
  i watched that video on the frontpage and was beyond shocked . 
  he 's allowed to walk around with that ?

  i 'd take it back even a few more steps . 
  what 's the least anxiety provoking thing related to needles that will still give her a tiny bit of anxiety . 
  what about a static picture of a needle or even a drawing on one ? 
  go super super slow .

  the watch is symbolic or your family is ? 
  because being an atheist on reddit has become such a cliche that mentioning anything atheism-related outside of / r/atheism makes you a circlejerker . 
  tell her that the condition of you driving her is that she seeks therapy for her panic attacks . 
  i know money is an issue but panic attacks are very serious and can lead to much larger issues . 
  i never learned to count . 
  public masturbation . 
  i ca n't be a teacher anymore .

  by all objective measures ( economic , justice , health , violence ) we live in the best world that has ever existed .

  i saw a woman almost drop her baby because she was trying to light her cigarette . 
  you know , you 're the first to ask me that . 
  you 're either incredibly biased or have 0 musical knowledge if you think that . 
  why is her being brown at all relevant to the story ? 
  none of you called the cops ? 
  dan savage is the relationship guru when it comes to open relationships .

  do n't overcomplicate it . 
  / r/firstworldanarchists, 
  look , i get it , us politics are n't great but if you start comparing yourself to north korea you make it very clear that you have no sense of context . 
  seriously . 
  it 's not really appropriate to give a diagnosis of a mental disorder of someone based on 2nd hand information . 
  irrespective of what he does/doesn ' t have , he needs to be talking a professional about it if he has n't moved on after this long and it 's also not an appropriate question for this sub . 
  touch my penis .

  very similar to my story . 
  was basically stuck at home for a while with nothing to do but work out . 
  managed to find a girlfriend because of it and then got sick with mono and was couch bound for a few months . 
  that plus new relationship plus learning to be an awesome cook started the momentum and it just keeps feeling further from where i was and the further it seems , the harder it is to start . 
  right back at you, 
  ah you play american rules . 
  australian rules are that both count equal .
