  there 's a huge range of people who will see/not see your post immediately and not all of them have the same sense of humour/sensibilities . 
  if the first two people who see it are two people who were always going to dislike it , they 're also then going to dissuade others from looking or fairly evaluating - when was the last time you saw a post that was 1/2 and ( a ) look at it and ( b ) decided to upvote/respond to it . 
  i know i 'm going to cop flack for this but i 've removed this post because it really is n't an askreddit question . 
  if you want this to happen , the best thing you can do is post it to / r/ideasfortheadmins as the admins regularly read it . 
  if you make your own logo it 's probably more likely to happen too . 
  i made a woops, 
  that the world was less than 6,000 years old . 
  not trying to start a circlejerk here but that 's pretty damn wrong . 
  everybody dance * now *, 
  to be fair , it was probably true at the time you heard it . 
  how does my list stack up to yours ? 
  i think my parents ( really , just my mom ) did a pretty good job but i 've learned a lot that i 'll do differently through my studies in psychology . 
  for one , i ** certainly ** wo n't use any form of corporal punishment because the evidence says that it really does n't work ( [ here ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) is a link to a huge meta-analysis on the topic for anyone interested ) . 
  honestly , my biggest aim is to have children that truly believe that they 'll be loved no matter what they do or who they become . 
  i always want to punish the ** action ** , not the child . 
  for example `` drawing on the wall is naughty '' is very different to `` you 're naughty for drawing on the wall '' from a child 's perspective . 
  one is a judgement , the other is information . 
  finally having enough money saved up to buy a 2nd hand gameboy from cash converters ( a chain of pawn shops where people trade old electronics for drug money ) and pokemon yellow . 
  i have lifelong neck issues from looking downwards for the next 6 months . 
  you cringe when you hear `` jolly rancher '', 
  melbourne , australia . 
  jewish school no less . 
  amputation . 
  your use of the term logic is very , very loose . 
  i have n't read the paper , someone linked it somewhere else in this thread and it seemed to apply to this guy 's question . 
  i have way too many comments to sift through and work out if this is actually # 1 but it 's about 2300 so if it is n't , it 's close to the top . 
  ** edit that is so important i 'm putting it at the top : ** a few people have asked me how to find a psychologist . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://locator.apa.org/ ) a directory for the us and canada . 
  if you need one for somewhere else , try googling and message me if you ca n't find something . 
  ** psychology ** . 
  here are some things i wish everyone knew, 
  * there are ~ ~ two ~ ~ three types of psychology - academic , clinical and ** organisational ** . 
  academic psychology is studying the mind , it 's a science . 
  clinical psychology is the practise of treating mental illness . 
  organisational psych deals with , obviously enough , the psychology of organisations and all that entails . 
  * there are three different types of people you can see - a counsellor , a psychologist and a psychiatrist . 
  counsellors and psychologists are similar . 
  they 'll both use primarily talk therapy to help work through issues . 
  neither can prescribe medication . 
  psychologists are simply better trained and have more of an academic background . 
  there are also higher standards required to practice . 
  psychiatrists are doctors . 
  they 're trained in medical school and ** will ** prescribe medication but are * often * less trained in talk therapy ( this depends on several factors ) . 
  in my opinion , a psychologist should always be the first port of call with a psychiatrist used to prescribe medication if the mental illness is preventing adequate treatment . 
  * not all therapists are focussed on your mothers . 
  there are lots of different types of therapies that have different focusses . 
  if you want to know more about the different types i can explain it to you . 
  * academic psychology ** is a science ** . 
  it informs clinical psychology but is not based on case studies . 
  it is practised in the same way as any other science - double-blinding , experimental manipulations , peer-review journals etc. 
  * talk therapy is used ** because it works ** . 
  study after study has shown how incredibly effective it is in treating mental illness . 
  * everyone is biassed , uses motivated reasoning , succumbs to their emotions and totally favours their in-group . 
  * people are terrible at predicting what will make them happy/sad . 
  this area is called affective forecasting and is brilliantly explained by [ dan gilbert ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ) . 
  most notably , we ** really ** over-estimate how much difference having more money will make to our lives . 
  * becoming mentally ill ** is not a sign of weakness ** and ** nobody chooses to be depressed ** . 
  it 's no different to becoming physically ill . you can do more/less to get treatment and there are things you can do to help protect you from getting sick in the future , but getting sick does n't make you less of a person . 
  also , suffering from a mental illness does n't mean the person is violent or `` crazy '' . 
  there are plenty of people in your life that have a mental illness and you 'll never know . 
  * this one really upsets me - there 's a horrible belief started by the `` self-help '' movement that responding too much to crying babies will teach them to cry more . 
  this is horrible . 
  [ early attachment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attachment_theory ) is ** incredibly ** important and babies need to feel safe and secure . 
  they 're crying because they do n't feel safe . 
  if you do n't respond to them crying , you 're teaching them that they ca n't / wo n't get support and this has huge , lifelong effects ( see the link ) . 
  - ** i 've had a few questions about what happens with the different types of attachment so here 's a quick tl ; dr ** . 
  the biggest difference it seems to have is in coping styles . 
  the tendency is that securely attached people are the best at coping because they learn the world is a safe/manageable place . 
  insecurely attached people fall into two main categories ( some have more categories but i 'm trying to keep it simple-ish ) anxious and avoidant . 
  anxiously attached people are worried they wo n't get care so they hyperactive - get so loud that people ca n't help but hear they need help . 
  you know the type , the world is always coming crashing down and they bring everyone else into their upset . 
  the other extreme end is avoidant where people use deactivating strategies . 
  in this case , the person has n't really learned how to deal with distress so they squash it down , generally not even feeling it . 
  the problem is that this does n't resolve the problem at all . 
  * self-help books in general are full of shit . 
  * meditation is magnificent and has been shown to drastically reduce anxious/depressive symptoms . 
  read more [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu ) at ucla 's mindfulness research centre . 
  they have information on the research and some guided meditations to try . 
  a few minutes a day will actually cause physical changes in your brain . 
  - a point on meditation . 
  a lot of people stop doing it because they think they 're `` bad at it '' . 
  there 's no such thing as being `` good '' at meditation . 
  the benefit you get from it is n't keeping your focus on a certain point , the benefit you get is from realising that your brain is n't where you want it to be and calmly refocussing . 
  if you were `` good at it '' , there 'd be no point doing it . 
  * if i could give three tips to anyone to increase their own well-being they would be : regularly meditate , regular exercise , learn to express your emotions in a measured way . 
  * ** credit to allegrofroggy ** : you 're not `` so ocd '' or `` so bipolar '' in the same way that you would n't say `` omg i feel like such cancer today '' . 
  mental illnesses are pervasive and enduring , they 're not a state of mind or something that you 're kind of quirky about . 
  they affect your life in a drastic manner . 
  * `` we only use 10 % of our brain , if we could unlock the other 90 % we 'd be able to x , y or z '' . 
  this is nonsensical for several reasons . 
  ( 1 ) too many signals is a bad thing , it 's called a seizure . 
  ( 2 ) we use more than 10 % of our brain . 
  ( 3 ) most of our brain is n't there for cognition ( thinking ) , it 's there for movement , sensations etc. 
  ( 4 ) many parts of our brain are inhibitory , not just excitatory . 
  * ** credit to streethawk1 ** : there are differences in what the right and left sides of our brain do . 
  however , people are n't either a `` left-brain '' or `` right-brain '' person . 
  it 's a meaningless concept . 
  * ** credit to mtk67 ** : people do n't fit exactly into diagnoses and there are several types of `` catch-alls '' that cover mental illness that does n't fit neatly into a category - for example , [ eating disorder not otherwise specified ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eating_disorder_not_otherwise_specified ) . 
  this is n't because psychology is unscientific , this is a result of behaviour being ** very complex ** . 
  - to expand on the above point , for something to be a mental illness and not just a personality trait or quirk , it must fit a few criteria .
