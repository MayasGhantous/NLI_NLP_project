  1 ) it must be enduring in that it affects you across space and time . 
  2 ) it must be maladaptive or cause maladaptive behaviours ( e.g. , mood changes , psychosis , self-harm etc. ), 
  to the point that it affects normal functioning and 3 ) it must be distressing . 
  * ** credit to cwagner ** : schizophrenia vs dissociative identity disorder . 
  schizophrenia does * not * mean split personality . 
  schizophrenia symptoms are split into two categories : positive and negative . 
  positive symptoms means adding something to reality ( hallucinations , delusions etc. ), 
  whereas negative symptoms are a deficit ( disordered speech , anhedonia etc. ) . 
  dissociative identity disorder is when one person has more than one identity ( termed an alter ) . 
  they ** are not ** the same illness . 
  * reinforcement/punishment : this is one i hear incorrect often . 
  ** positive reinforcement ** is when a positive stimulus follows an action , making it more likely to reoccur ( e.g. , you eat a piece of cake , you feel a nice taste in your mouth ) . 
  ** negative reinforcement ** is a negative stimulus being taken away because of an action , making it more likely to reoccur ( e.g. , you feel really full and go to the bathroom , you get rid of an uncomfortable feeling in your stomach ) . 
  ** punishment ** is when a behaviour is followed by a negative stimulus and makes the action less likely to be done again ( e.g. , you hate yourself for eating too much cake ) . 
  ** as requested ** - here 's a quick run down of 4 of the major types of therapy ( the ones i know best ) . 
  please note that most ( good ) therapists will use a * combination of tools * derived from the different therapies . 
  they 're all effective in different ways and for a few disorders , similarly effective . 
  however , some are the preferred treatment for specific mental illnesses . 
  also , if you 're a practitioner , please message me if any of my points need clarification . 
  * cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) - cbt is focussed on adjusting maladaptive thought patterns . 
  the idea is essentially that maladaptive thought patterns ( ones that do n't conform to reality and cause disruptive behaviour ) exist because of a feedback loop . 
  the therapist and patient will attempt to break this loop by ** reality testing ** ideas to see if they 're true or just a product of maladaptive thought . 
  this reduces the emotion attached to them , thereby reducing maladaptive thinking the next time . 
  for example , your friend cancels lunch with you and you get upset . 
  you would write down all of the possible reasons they cancelled `` they do n't really want to be my friend any more '' , `` i 'm not interesting enough '' and try to work out whether they 're `` true '' or simply a product of distortion . 
  * psychodynamic psychotherapy - this is the modern version of freud 's psychoanalysis . 
  the focus is on creating a therapeutic alliance wherein the patient is able to explore his/her past . 
  in doing this , the unconscious reasons for behaviour can be uncovered . 
  for example , the patient may be upset due to a series of bad relationships . 
  they would try to look at what they 're lacking from their past or what needs they 're trying to fulfill that are leading to back decisions . 
  please note : although this is linked the freud , the evidence says that it ** does ** work . 
  one can practice psychodynamics without accepting the psychosocial stages of development . 
  * acceptance and commitment therapy ( act ) - act is about creating acceptance for who you are and your situation in life . 
  it focusses on retraining you to be happy with where you 're at , instead of fighting to feel a certain way or be at a certain place . 
  this is thought to lead to psychological ** flexibility ** and a better ability to be present in the moment . 
  * mindfulness based stress reduction ( mbsr ) - mbsr is essentially a therapy based on mindfulness . 
  for more information on mindfulness meditation , see above .

  higher ranked mods can remove mods . 
  admins are completely separate as they 're hired by reddit . 
  if the top ranked mod is `` corrupt '' the only answer is a mass exodus . 
  at the end of the day , the top ranked mods essentially `` own '' the subreddit and as long as they 're not transgressing reddit 's tos , they 're allowed to run their subreddit as they like . 
  studies show that someone is more likely to enjoy the smell of someone of the opposite gender 's body odour if they 're a good mating match in regards to their immune system . 
  there 's no such thing as an `` admin '' of a subreddit . 
  mods run subreddits , admins run reddit . 
  admins wo n't overrule a mod unless they 're doing something ** really ** bad . 
  which subreddit/mod are you concerned about and why ? 
  if he 's the top mod ( top of the mod list ) , the best thing you can do is try to get more public pressure . 
  get a bunch of evidence and post it to / r/subredditdrama . 
  make it so embarrassing for him and the other mods that he has no choice . 
  which rules are at issue here ? 
  is it true that you 're consistently breaking the rules ? 
  which rules are you breaking and why ? 
  if she 's posting things that contradict the teachings in a specific way , why not address those concerns instead of silencing her ? 
  surely , given that you 've got `` home turf '' it would be fairly easy to do so or even just let the downvotes take care of her posts ( which they seem to be doing ) . 
  if that 's the case , i do n't really think that your rules clearly lay out that you only want posts to conform to your very narrow view of what lds is . 
  i do n't mean that as a criticism but you specifically say that you only want views that conform with your own , yet the sidebar only mentions views that conform with those of the church . 
  you know better than i that there 's variation in views and if you only want one view represented , you should say so . 
  you 've got male pattern baldness, 
  all of his mid to late 80s movies * were * the hangover . 
  his son is also equally awesome and hilarious . 
  i did n't tell him he * had * to do anything . 
  that was me . 
  i do n't really consider myself a `` part '' of the drama which is why i posted it but thought that i should remove and let someone else post it anyway . 
  i just responded to her originally to be nice . 
  then he turned up and i could n't turn down the chance to learn more . 
  `` what 's the sound of one hand clapping ? '', 
  * proceeds to clap with one hand *, 
  it works better in person when you can see that i can clap quite loudly with one hand . 
  i think i follow you now . 
  what i was trying to get across is that i do n't think he * has * to . 
  as i said elsewhere , he essentially owns the sub and he can do with it what he likes . 
  i was wondering ** why ** he does n't . 
  there are lots of different factors . 
  here 's a quick list of a few off the top of my head . 
  * you do n't have the same amount of time per portion of food ( ca n't go to the same lengths to prepare , ca n't watch it as well , ca n't individually taste and season portions ) . 
  * style of cooking is compromised for speed ( ever trying cooking too much food in the same pot , it does n't work in the same way - heat is very important in cooking ) . 
  * quality of ingredients . 
  no school is spending $ 20 on a piece of steak . 
  * quality of staff .
