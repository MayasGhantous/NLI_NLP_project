  nothing personal against lunch ladies but they 're simply not as talented or well educated as a trained chef . 
  * cooking to order . 
  in a restaurant , the order comes in and the prep is mostly done . 
  most of the work at that stage is cooking the item itself . 
  you may cook a few at a time but generally not more than you can handle . 
  in a lunchroom , they have to cook masses of food all at the same time . 
  that food sits for much longer too .

  you 're asking why people do n't have potentially fun/meaningful/fulfilling relationships in an effort to avoid others ' prejudice ? 
  hmm .

  skepticism is a method of inquiry . 
  i 've had no reason to question skepticism because ** it works ** . 
  if i 'm proven wrong ** on a topic ** , i 'll gladly change my views . 
  as for my atheism , the evidence for god is incredibly underwhelming , especially if you consider how easy it would be for a god to prove his own existence * and * how much contrary evidence there is . 
  literally , being a guy .

  no-one picks up the pieces for you when you fuck up or ca n't handle things for a few days .

  they just make you think that you 're interesting . 
  reddit has an automatic vote fudging system . 
  you seem to be confusing skepticism and atheism . 
  most atheists reach their position through skepticism . 
  if they 're a ** skeptic ** , it would be inconsistent to also believe in ghosts . 
  however , being an atheist only means you do n't believe in god . 
  there are all sorts of atheists who believe in all sorts of crazy things . 
  it 's to mess with the spam bots but i 'm not smart enough to know why .

  ( a ) theism is a question of belief . 
  do you or do you not believe in a god ? 
  ( a ) gnosticism is a question of knowledge . 
  can one have knowledge of a god ? 
  they 're two seperate questions that overlap . 
  one can be any combination - atheist agnostic , atheist gnostic , agnostic theist or gnostic theist . 
  the answer , like most personality traits , is both . 
  most personality studies find a roughly 50/50 gene/environment involvement in personality factors . 
  one big factor in this is what we call the gene-environment reciprocal model . 
  little johnny is a 3 year old kid who loves being outside and running around with other kids . 
  that 's where he 's at his happiest . 
  so , of course , his mother is going to involve him in lots of activities where he can do that . 
  at that point , his genetic disposition ( extraversion ) is being reinforced by his environment . 
  the same is true for people who are introverted . 
  even as an adult , if you 're naturally more predisposed to liking quiet , less social activities , your skills and experiences will reflect that and cause you to go further in that direction . 
  so , the short answer is 50/50 . 
  the long answer is that our dispositions affect our environment which affect our dispositions . 
  i should also mention that there are `` complementary '' traits that will affect your disposition too . 
  for example , being very anxious obviously leads itself more to introversion than extroversion . 
  similarly , risk taking ( some have actually argued it 's a subset of extroversion ) , will likely lead people to the far end of the extroversion spectrum . 
  lastly , not all experiences are created equally . 
  one can have an extroverted personality that lead them to be incredibly social and `` party '' all the time but experience such a drastic environment that it completely changes their behaviour . 
  hi , i 'm imnotjesus , and i have an anti-messiah complex . 
  i assumed the cure was german architecture . 
  lots of lube . 
  oh . . that kind of asshole . 
  i deal with them by being the person i want to be and knowing that the asshole you 're dealing with is probably that way because they 're really unhappy . 
  i ca n't control how other people act , only myself . 
  that 's what i concentrate on .

  are you telling me that a comedic actor has more spare time to answer questions from people on the intnernet and joke around more than that president of the usa who is also campaigning ?

  never tell your girlfriend that moments before ejaculate comes out a small amount of urine does to sanitise the pathway unless you never want her to swallow again . 
   that the sensation of love is a series of chemoelectric reactions and not at all magical, 
  you could say that about literally any experience you have . 
  up always wins in these threads . 
  for me it 's [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkst5-zfhw ) in good will hunting . 
  do your own homework . 
  why ? 
  how does a biological basis for sensations make them any less real an experience ? 
  a rainbow is just light refracting but that does n't make it any less beautiful to look at .

  no questions . 
  if the teacher ignores her , tell the prinicipal . 
  if the principal ignores her , call the cops . 
  this is n't an askreddit question . 
  at a party with a bunch of friends , we gave one guy a joint full of mixed dried herbs from the cupboard and he spent the rest of the night telling us how stoned he was and rapping quite a lot . 
  i do n't think we ever did .
