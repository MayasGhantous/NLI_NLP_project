  i think we thought it would do more harm than good since he had such a good time ( this was like 10 years ago now ) . 
  that 's basically what happens in most panic attacks . 
  people notice themselves starting to panic which causes more panic etc. 
  the `` cure '' is to try and focus on something repetitive and calming like your breath . 
  focussing on the sensations as a way of tricking your brain in to not noticing the panic . 
  [ ask and ye shall receive , my child ] ( http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/media-releases/pandering-stupidity ), 
  i think split-brain findings are even more damning than brain lesions . 
  here 's vs ramachandran talking about a [ split brain with one half atheist and one half theist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjptvrli64 ),

  fuck heart . 
  i get a ** lot ** of shit for this on reddit but i 'm very much against spanking as punishment for children . 
  the psychology research says that it 's not just an ineffective technique but also has many negative side-effects including much higher rates of mental health issues - [ link to a meta-analysis ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) . 
  also , i always get a lot of messages from people saying `` i was hit as a kid and i turned out okay '' . 
  i understand that you may have but there 's a reason that science does n't rely on one person 's subjective experience of their own upbringing . 
  i posted a paper on / r/science recently from the journal addiction ( one of the most respected journals around ) that talked about the relationship between regular marijuana use and anxiety disorders . 
  boy did that get downvoted quickly with a whole bunch of `` experts '' coming out of the woodworks . 
  redditors will constantly congratulate themselves on being pro-science . 
  the problem is that it seems to only be in the areas that the masses already agree with . 
  post that marijuana is bad for your health or that spanking your children is a terrible parenting strategy ( [ link ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) ) and you get downvoted faster than a pro-mitt romney post . 
  that the two most dangerous things in the world are dogma and ideologies . 
  you read that where ? 
  or were you making it up because you 've already decided what you believe ? 
  the reason for difference in iq between race x and race y has a demonstrable genetic difference . 
  please note : there is a lot of evidence that this ** is n't ** true . 
  correct but there is n't evidence that there 's a meaningful genetic difference between the races in regards to iq . 
  the bell curve as a statistics device is valid . 
  i thought you were referring to the book named the bell curve which is the book that most famously made the argument of a genetic difference between races . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  [ streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) . 
  i agree to some extent . 
  i just wanted an excuse to show their litigation history . 
  i feel like it would help clear up a lot of confusion . 
  my iphone . 
  while the iphone itself would be fairly valuable to sell to a tech company , the greater value would be in being able to prove that i 'm actually from the future . 
  i can live the rest of my life comfortably being paid millions of dollars by all sorts of investment companies to consult . 
  i get a ** lot ** of shit for this on reddit but i 'm very much against spanking as punishment for children . 
  the psychology research says that it 's not just an ineffective technique but also has many negative side-effects including much higher rates of mental health issues - [ link to a meta-analysis ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) ( tl ; dr - spanking is bad , less spanking is less bad . 
  there 's no actual benefit in doing it ) . 
  also , i always get a lot of messages from people saying `` i was hit as a kid and i turned out okay '' . 
  i understand that you may have but there 's a reason that science does n't rely on one person 's subjective experience of their own upbringing . 
  the research generally contrasts the outcomes for kids who are spanked and are n't spanked ( or by how much they were spanked ) while trying to control for other variables ( things like ses ) . 
  like a lot of developmental research , it is n't perfect because you ca n't have a true experimental study - it would be unethical to run a study where half the kids get spanked and the other half do n't - so you have to rely on longitudinal and correlational data . 
  that being said , there is ** a lot ** of data to suggest that kids who are spanked are more likely to suffer mental health problems and have more behavioural issues . 
  `` if nothing we do matters then all that matters is what we do . '', 
  i do n't think my life has some higher purpose or greater goal . 
  i think all that matters in this life is my experience of it and how i use it to make the world a better place . 
  realising that changed my life . 
  i know some guys like it but i * hate * it . 
  well done . 
  nah they split 20 years ago . 
  he stopped going to landmark for ages but broke up with his partner recently which caused him to go back . 
  sure . 
  pm me with whatever you need to know . 
  i 'll try my best to answer . 
  honestly , except for the [ drop bears ] ( http://australianmuseum.net.au/drop-bear ) it is n't so bad . 
  that 's the part you got stuck on and not the hipsters ? 
  i ca n't walk down the street without seeing one . 
  wow . 
  you managed to still get worse with that 2nd joke . 
  truly an impressive effort . 
  it 's lovely that you care so much about your friend , i mean that sincerely . 
  the thing is that this is such a big life change , such a big sacrifice , that it 's not something he can do unless he buys into the process 100 % . 
  that being said , if you feel close enough to him that you wo n't hurt his feelings , ask him if he has tried losing weight in the past or wants to . 
  if he says yes , ask him what 's stopped him and offer to help . 
  he may tell you to fuck off , do n't be surprised if he does . 
  if he wants support , you can do it by offering to go to the gym with him , helping him do research , letting him talk to you when he 's struggling etc. 
  at the end of the day though , it 's his journey and there 's no way you 'll be able to carry him through . 
  as for therapy , it may help but it depends on why he 's overweight . 
  i probably would n't lead with it though . 
  to add to this ; a modern psychological understanding of obesity suggests that it 's really not as simple as making a choice to be skinnier . 
  fat people are n't lazy . 
  anyone who has lived and experienced what it 's like to try and change a lifetime of habits knows that . 
  * let me put it in a way that might make it easier to understand * . 
  let 's say that you 're an alcoholic . 
  your life spun out of control and you got to a point that you wanted to stop . 
  you quit . 
  stop drinking . 
  it 's hard but you 're committed and you really want to . 
  imagine now that 3 times a day you have to drink ** a little ** bit of alcohol . 
  just a few sips . 
  not just that , but you have to drink alcohol you do n't like as much because you know that your favourite is worse for you . 
  every day , throughout your recovery , you have to ** make a choice ** to only have a few sips of that alcohol you do n't particularly like . 
  does n't sound like such an easy choice now does it ? 
  i 'm a food addict . 
  i 'm emotionally affected by the food i eat .

  how stupid is this friend ? 
  i was taught that the world was 5700 years old . 
  not trying to start an atheism circlejerk but that 's pretty fucking far off the mark . 
  i went to a jewish school . 
  we were taught that the jews built the pyramids . 
  it 's very much incorrect . 
  it 's cheap to make and people like it . 
  there 's still just as much good tv as ever , there 's just more crap too . 
  get over it . 
  getting downvoted on reddit for writing something scientifically accurate but not necessarily agreed with by the majority on reddit . 
  for example , i get downvoted heavily when i mention that there 's an incredible amount of evidence that spanking is a terrible parenting technique .
