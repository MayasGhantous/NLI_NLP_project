  edit : evidence - [ here ] ( http://www.repeal43.org/docs/gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3a02.pdf ) is a link to the largest meta-analysis on the issue . 
  basically it found that out of 11 outcomes the only one that was better with spanking was immediate compliance . 
  which essentially means that spanking causes the child to comply at * that * moment but does n't create behaviour change . 
  additionally , there are much higher rates of mental health issues and poorer relationships with the parents for those who were spanked . 
  also , i always get a lot of messages from people who say that they were spanked and turned out okay . 
  i 'm not trying to say that your parents were bad parents or anything like that . 
  no psych finding is universally true and it * may * have been good for * you * . 
  that being said , it does n't change what the science finds and there 's a reason that science does n't rely on one person 's subjective experience of their own upbringing . 
  funnily enough , it only happens in the context of a thread like this . 
  also , even now , a lot of people are downvoting me for it . 
  it 's not exactly well accepted . 
  i promise , i 'll be getting pms all night from people telling me about their own experience of being spanked and why the science does n't apply to them .

  i mean this in the nicest way possible but there 's a reason that science does n't rely on one person 's subjective opinion of their own upbringing . 
  for one thing , it 's very possible that it was good for you . 
  no findings are universally true . 
  the more important thing though is that there are all sorts of reasons why you could be mistaken from post-hoc rationalisation , cognitive biases and distorted memory from motivated reasoning . 
  i really do n't mean to sound denigrating , i 'm just explaining why the science should mean more than one person 's opinion . 
  yeah , i do n't know why but this is one i love fighting , even thought i find it immensely frustrating . 
  i 'm happily monogamous but i do n't think it 's for everyone . 
  i had a `` rivalry '' with a guy on wow . 
  this was in the really early days when priests could mind control and then use emotes to communicate with the other side . 
  basically , i did that a few times , calling him out for being an asshole ( long story ) and he got incredibly angry . 
  so angry that he got a friend to go on our vent channel and threaten that he was going to fly to australia to beat me up . 
  well , maybe you should stop being such a sinner then ( kidding ) . 
  yeah u/bieber _ army can be pretty aggressive . 
  the myth of the noble savage . 
  because the defaults are decided by popularity . 
  yes , because anyone who enjoys internet culture * must * be a basement dwelling 40 year old man . 
  i normally go there straight after the jewish media conspiracy meetings . 
  i only park there because it 's the only spot big enough for my van . 
  you park there so you can watch me masturbating ? 
  you sicko . 
   but - assuming that there is a purpose, 
  why make that assumption ? 
  there 's no logical reason to . 
  the far more interesting question is `` what purpose can we create for ourselves '' . 
  for you , searching for the purpose of life may be a fruitful one . 
  for others , the purpose may be very different . 
  oh god , you 're making me secrete so much dopamine right now . 
  you need to realise that you 're not going to get him with a `` gotcha '' question . 
  despite being wrong on a lot of things , he 's incredibly well prepared for any question you could possibly think of . 
  or the positive symptoms of schizophrenia . 
  are we still dirty talking ? 
  same for most internet speak . 
  someone saying `` lol '' in conversation is very jarring . 
  oh who 's your daddy ? 
  no really , i forgot . 
  who 's your daddy ? 
   access ministries received more than $ 21 million in federal grants under the school chaplaincy program between 2007 and 2011, 
  yet they 're still almost bankrupt . 
  incredibly low . 
  there would be some sort of evidence . 
  the whole band had to stop and click the beat for me . 
  i call it foreplay . 
  walk-sturbate is my new favourite thing . 
  terrible . 
  just terrible . 
  exactly . 
  no-one is an asshole to other people because they 're happy with their own life . 
  it takes some kind of horrible emotional deficit to get to that point . 
  i thought i invented the idea of hedonism . 
  redditor for 0 days . 
  lame . 
  do what i did on my saturday - watch the daily show and masturbate ... not at the same time though . 
  look , sometimes i 'm surprised . 
  do n't leave us hanging ... how did it taste ? 
  because you oiled it ? 
  people kept getting me confused with someone else . 
  i look exactly like my gardener . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  holy shit , you 're llwolfll ? 
  hey man . 
  nothing worse than a bloody asshole . 
  at a doctor 's office . 
  has she ever mentioned it to her doctor ? 
  i 'm just fucking with you . 
  if she 's too embarrassed to talk about her reproductive health with her doctor then she 's an idiot and so are you for trying to get medical advice from anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  go to the doctor . 
  there were n't actually any hot singles in my area waiting to meet me . 
  i should add that i 've also had some dealings with a less than honest nigerian prince, 
  you ca n't control how other people behave , all you can control is how * you * behave . 
  it does n't matter what this guy does/doesn ' t do , you should ** be the person you want to be ** . 
  is the person you want to be someone who would show everyone ? 
  it does n't sound like it to me . 
  ** if ** this is true , it 's a criminal matter and not suitable for askreddit . 
  also , consider moving a school where they teach you how to spell college . 
  step 1 . 
  read the rules of the subreddit you 're in, 
  slices of truffle are really , really not worth the cost . 
  i 've had more truffle than most people ever get to try . 
  honestly , it has * very * little actual taste . 
  the vast majority of what you get is in the smell . 
  protip , buy some nice truffle salt ( $ 30 jar will last you months and months ) and you get just as much deliciousness as huge slices of truffle . 
  i like to mix everything with condescension . 
  as someone who has had anxiety problems , has a psychology degree and works in the field i do feel that i have some expertise to say that .
