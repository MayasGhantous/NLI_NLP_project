  work much , much harder . 
  i got into the course i wanted to but i did n't deserve to . 
  the problem was once i got there , i had ** no ** study skills at all and it almost cost me a lot . 
  a ) my sentence did n't end there . 
  b ) i do n't think it makes me qualified to treat/diagnose him . 
  however , i do feel like the combination of those three experiences/training does give me some level of insight . 
  my advice ( not professional opinion ) was that he talk to a professional . 
  i made absolutely no claims above my level of study . 
  i 've reached up to the top of a cupboard onto to find a large bag of rock salt open . 
  the bag started pouring out onto my face and huge pieces of rock salt slammed into my eyes . 
  the agony . 
  me and some friends were being assholes to one of our friends and trying to throw his hat into a tree . 
  since he was very unathletic , i suggested that i jump up and put the hat in the tree where he ca n't reach it so that we could get it down later . 
  i leapt up with all my might , not noticing the plastic tie around the tree . 
  it sliced up the side of my stomach and to this day i have a 4 inch long scar from the experience . 
  when i was 10 i was playing this game with my sister where she lies flat on her back with her legs up in the air and i balance of her feet and pretend like i 'm flying . 
  we decided to do this on a bed , in a hotel room , in a different state , when our father was an hour away on business . 
  i fell off her legs , breaking the growth plate in my wrist and had to be rushed to hospital . 
  2 surgeries and 6 months later it was better . 
  a couple of ideas of resources :, 
  1 ) yale has a psychology of morality course that 's freely available on itunesu and a couple of the topics covered some theoretical ideas around ptsd . 
  could be worth a listen . 
  2 ) seligman has done some amazing research recently with unparalleled access to armed forces members . 
  i would be reading ** everything ** about his recent work . 
  my guess would be that it has more to do with the memories you have of that object than the object itself ( assuming you do n't have [ paraphilia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paraphilia ) ) . 
  the brain works in networks where everything is connected to related items . 
  when you activate , let 's say , the dog node , there 's a small amount of activation in all sorts of nodes that are related for * you * ( walking , food , mess , whatever ) . 
  you probably have a lot of nodes that are very special to you that are connected to that lens that are triggered every time you look at it . 
  eating as many calories as we can . 
  it 's not just obsolete , it 's incredibly dangerous . 
  spot on . 
  whenever you see/think about the lens , it triggers ( even if just a small way ) the memories of those trips . 
  the other possibility ( and it 's probably a combination of the two ) has to do with cognitive biases . 
  it 's killing me that i 'm blanking on the name but there 's a cognitive bias where it 's been found that people consistently over-estimate the value of things they currently own and under-estimate the value of things they do n't own . 
  dan ariely talks about it a lot in one of his books and the name escapes me . 
  it 's about as necessary as a white pride round . 
  edit : instead of being snarky i should explain what i mean . 
  the reason that a `` pride round '' is important is that an obscene number of people in our society think of homosexuality as something lesser . 
  it does n't change opinions over night but it 's about the afl and the players making a stand that a quite widely oppressed minority deserve support ( in the same way they 've done with indigenous people ) . 
  there are always going to be racists and there are always going to be homophobes but there 's ** a lot ** the afl can do to reduce the stigma and make it safe for gay players to come out . 
   young gay people are up to 6 times more likely to be depressed , to self harm , or to contemplate suicide . 
  if you do n't think that 's a problem , i do n't know what else to say to you . 
  big \u00b7 ot \u00b7 ed / \u02c8big\u0259tid /, 
  adjective :, 
  obstinately convinced of the superiority or correctness of one 's own opinions and prejudiced against those who hold different opinions . 
  ** expressing or characterized by prejudice and intolerance . 
  what have you said so far that * does n't * show prejudice and intolerance ? 
  good call . 
  you 're right . 
  i agree . 
  but , some people responding badly does n't mean we should make less effort , it means we should make more . 
  yes !, 
  [ for those wondering what ( s ) he 's talking about ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8aqjh/awww_this_is_just_too_sad_pic/c08pp5z ) . 
  the greatest moment in reddit history . 
  that 's right , you heard me potus . 
  seriously . 
  go into an internet cafe and apply at all of the fast food chains and supermarket chains you can think of . 
  then go to the biggest shopping centre and hand out resumes . 
  one day of work and you 'll be guaranteed at least a few interviews and our minimum wage is * very * liveable . 
  protip : do n't do both . 
  it 's hard to say this and be balanced but the biggest answer is ignorance . 
  there are certainly some gm crop ** companies ** that have used unethical tactics ( true for large companies in most industries ) but that does n't change the fact that gm crops are not just incredibly safe but have the potential to completely eradicate a large number of third world health issues . 
  if you want the psychological answer , the biggest factor is probably the [ naturalistic fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naturalistic_fallacy ) . 
  beyond that , there are industries built around competing with gm crops who are incentivised to spread misinformation . 
  the same way that professionals of all fields who deal with incredible hardship ( doctors , psychologists , social workers etc. ), 
  deal with it . 
  they learn to compartmentalise and separate their own lives from their work lives . 
  you do that by realising that the best way to help people is keeping some level of emotional distance from the people you 're trying to help . 
  it 's important to still care but if you start investing all of your emotional energy into every case , you ca n't survive . 
  i volunteer for a crisis support counselling service and learn all sorts of tools to do this . 
  read some cv guides, 
  always write a cover letter, 
  apply for ** everything ** . 
  most of the jobs i 've had i 've been underqualified for . 
  asscredit used to be the mouseover text on the logo here . 
  not sure who changed it . 
  that 's good . 
  i 'd come up with a better solution though . 
  maybe something like `` taking a moment to step back and consider what 's important in my task '' or `` writing down a better plan '' or something .

  alternative medicine practitioner - the entire 15 minutes would be spent trying to suppress my conscience . 
  start with the subreddit rules . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  this is a question for your doctor . 
  yes but it 's not important to be tolerant of pseudoscience and fake medicine . 
  i did a `` psychology in the criminal justice system '' subject a couple of years ago . 
  i was so excited to learn more about the inner workings of criminals and how people get to that point . 
  nope . 
  pretty much the entire subject was about explaining how terrible we are at understanding crime and more importantly , that eyewitness accounts are so easily manipulated that its laughable . 
  actually , a brand new study came out saying that [ self-compassion ] ( http://www.spring.org.uk/2012/09/the-surprising-motivational-power-of-self-compassion.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+psychologyblog+%28psyblog%29 ) was the best way to quickly boost your self-confidence . 
  beyond that , i know it sounds silly but take a few minutes before the interview to just sit with pen and paper and write whatever comes to your mind . 
  do n't question it , do n't judge it , just write . 
  i know it sounds crazy but the studies show that it 's ** very ** effective . . 
  here 's the best summary i can give you . 
  we were told this story of a woman who was raped in her home by a man she did n't know . 
  after the crime , she described him to police officers and they eventually apprehended a man . 
  the man they apprehended was eventually freed because it was discovered that he was on a * live television performance * at the time . 
  apparently , the tv was on while the rape was occurring and the experience was so traumatic that she remembered the face of the man on tv as the criminal . 
  the point is this , human memory is very much flawed at the best of times .
