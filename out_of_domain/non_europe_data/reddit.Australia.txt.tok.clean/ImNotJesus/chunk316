  we think intuitively that if something is important enough , we 'll remember it even better . 
  the fact is that during trauma or extreme fear , we 're far worse at remembering for all sorts of reasons . 
  for example , if someone is holding a gun , the victim/witness will tend to stare at the gun more than the criminal . 
  lastly , i think that a very cursory knowledge of psychology and neuroscience suggests that our legal system is very flawed . 
  [ here 's david eagleman discussing it ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xebm0z_david-eagleman-on-transforming-the_people ) ( he 's a brilliant science educator , just do n't listen to his stuff on `` possibillianism '' or you 'll want to stop trusting him ) . 
  there are also some great psych courses available for free online from some top universities . 
  check [ this ] ( http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses ) out . 
  that 's not the reddit way . 
  what he should do is make a post about it on an internet forum asking for revenge ideas that he 'll never use , from people that would never do it themselves . 
  more eps of comedy bang bang !, 
  be careful that you do n't imply that other forms of therapy are necessarily inferior . 
  the data says that there 's almost no difference between cbt and psychodynamic/act etc. 
  in depression . 
  in all seriousness , blowing an air bubble down the urethra could lead to serious problems . 
  do n't do that . 
  my step-dad 's mother came from another country for a visit so we took her to a cricket match . 
  in australia , it 's fairly common for a lot of chants of `` you are a wanker '' in the crowd during the match . 
  afterwards , we all went to get some dinner and she loudly asked everyone at the table what a wanker was . 
  no-one had the heart to tell her . 
  i told my dad that i saw my sister making a bomb . 
  turns out it 's called a bong . 
  i hate to be that guy but it 's important to draw a distinction between feeling down and suffering from depression . 
  depression is a pervasive and disabling condition that lasts for an extended period of time . 
  it is a medical condition and should be treated as such ( therapy and/or medication ) . 
  speaking of stupid , assuming that a longer answers means a better informed or more accurate answer is ludicrous . 
  the fact is that both do a very good job of getting as quickly back to their talking points as possible . 
  i * was * disappointed that obama did n't take a harder stance on some issues and glad to see that romney does n't deny climate change like so many in his party do but i still think obama comes off ** much ** better if you actually bother to read the answers and not make assumptions based on their length . 
  while i sympathise with your situation , i 've had to remove the post as you 're asking for legal advice . 
  best of luck with the custody hearing and please talk to a real lawyer . 
  there 's a couple of different answers here and a bit of a `` we do n't know '' . 
  we do know that prolonged stress causes all sorts of terrible things through [ sustained increases in cortisol and adrenaline levels ] ( http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress/sr00001 ) . 
  we also know that the intense stress of a trauma can cause things like ptsd , depression , anixety disorders and/or many others . 
  additionally , we know that under stress people use maladaptive coping mechanisms which create more stress or manifest into mental illness - this is the basis of most psychological therapies . 
  lastly , we know that , as you rightly pointed out , genes and environment have a very complex interplay . 
  there are two different models ( that are n't really mutually exclusive ) to explain the interplay :, 
  ** stress-diathesis model ** - think of a whole series of cups . 
  the amount of water that starts in the cup is the genetic predisposition to a certain mental illness . 
  the water added over time is the stress of one 's environment . 
  some cups will start with so little water that they can take a huge amount of environment water without spilling over . 
  other cups will start with lots of predisposition but through luck and good management avoid ever overflowing at all . 
  it does seem though , that many mental illnesses involve a tipping point . 
  ** gene-environment reciprocal model ** - this model suggests that our predispositions help determine environments which often exacerbate the predisposition . 
  jimmy is 3 years old and his mother notices that he likes to play quietly and runs around a lot less than other 3 year olds . 
  as a result , his mother * more * likely to have activities where he is quiet or playing solitarily . 
  as a result , jimmy is likely to slide further down the introvert continuum while his cohorts are playing different types of games to him . 
  there 's nothing wrong with what jimmy 's mum did , she was just responding to what her son liked . 
  tl ; dr gene and environment are both very important but they interplay in complex and interesting ways . 
  stress can cause someone to reach a tipping point , teach them poor coping mechanisms/rules about life and has neurological side-effects from long-term exposure . 
  i do n't know whether to be creeped out or flattered that you remember enough of what i do/don ' t post to think you know me . 
  i post * a lot * and the vast majority * is n't * christianity stuff . 
  most of the stuff i find that 's relevant to / r/australia is though because that 's what appears on my fb feed . 
  also , i would n't call thinking the acl are a hate group to be anti-christian . 
  i know plenty of christians who would think the same thing . 
  i get almost no karma from / r/australia . 
  also , who cares about karma ? 
  i just post a lot because i want to share interesting stuff . 
  i 'm not under some delusion that i 'm going to change anyone 's opinion drastically because i post some 1:30 comedy clip . 
  i do n't mind if you ask me questions , i 'm just finding it odd . 
  if i cared , i would n't have answered . 
  they 're like every other younger generation . 
  annoying in their own new and exciting way but not worse than we were . 
  dm ; hs ? 
  please stop eating your vomit . 
  it does n't end well for either of us . 
  have you ever talked to a professional about it ? 
  it 's not . 
  i just know the stats from here . 
  look at that table i linked to , australia is actually better than most . 
  talking to a professional psychologist could help you learn to be okay with those feelings . 
  i know i went through a similar stage but now draw strength from the inevitability of my own death . 
  it makes me realise how lucky i am to exist in the first place and therefore devote my life to helping people . 
  there are certainly bad psychologists and psychiatrists out there . 
  i also work with many psychologists who discount/give free sessions to a lot of people . 
  / r/suicidewatch is a useful tool but not a sufficient one for someone who is suicidal . 
  in my opinion , given the nature of the subreddit , there is n't enough training/ability to ensure the safety of the posters . 
  if you can , i highly recommend calling a helpline instead of posting on / r/suicidewatch if you 're having suicidal thoughts . 
  i love it . 
  thank you . 
  depression lies is a brilliant phrase . 
  it gave me shivers the first time i read it . 
  you should try to become a telephone counsellor for a crisis support service . 
  that 's a great point . 
  i have n't recently but a few years ago i did . 
  i 'm really sorry to hear that . 
  do you have a local college with counselling services that you could go to ? 
  if not , i can give you a few little tips that might reduce your symptoms . 
  for one , there * are * books on cbt and act therapies designed to use on yourself that can be quite useful - [ for example ] ( http://www.thehappinesstrap.com/ ) . 
  the other thing you can do is start meditating . 
  the research says that mindfulness meditation has incredible mental health benefits including significantly reducing depressive and anxious symptoms - [ here are some free guided meditations from ucla 's mindfulness centre ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) . 
  beyond that , regular exercise and diet make a big difference and trying to connect with social groups around you . 
  lastly , if you 're having suicidal thoughts you really need to consider calling a helpline for help . 
  they 're trained in helping people in your situation and will also be able to give you ideas of resources in your area .
