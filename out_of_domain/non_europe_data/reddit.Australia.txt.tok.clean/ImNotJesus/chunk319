  did you even read it dipstick ? 
  i lost 100lbs . 
  i 'm just trying to explain how difficult it was in a way that people can understand . 
  it may have been easy for you , it is n't for everyone . 
  how about some compassion instead of acting like a jackass ? 
  would that really hurt you so badly ? 
  i do n't think you know what a dichotomy is . 
  i think you 'll also find that eating disorders are in the dsm ** and ** i never said that it 's the same thing . 
  it 's called an ** analogy ** . 
  look that word up after you look up dichotomy . 
  i like to think that he wears the bowtie during sex . 
  nothing but the bowtie, 
  that 's really up to andrew to explain or not . 
  it would be unfair to him to discuss any of the details . 
  rest assured though , there was n't a huge drama and there is n't some big issue behind it . 
  edit : did i go crazy or did you edit this from a post about andrew ? 
  that 's the rationale . 
  we know that people use askreddit as a means to an end and we 're trying to close that loophole here . 
  there 's a lot of power in being able to reach this many people and we 're just trying to keep it fair . 
  that 's harder to assess and less dangerous than `` x company did y , how can i get the word out ? '', 
  that 's a really tough question . 
  it 's certainly used that way by a lot of people . 
  part of the reason for this post is that we want to make what we think askreddit is about explicit . 
  askreddit is about asking questions designed to create discussion and get other people 's opinions . 
  when people start using it as a platform , disguised as a question , i think it hurts the sub . 
  what do you think ? 
  / r/firstworldanarchists, 
  [ ch ch ch ch changes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl3vxeudif8 ), 
  i 'll be honest . 
  we tend to be * more * lenient with posts that are already on the frontpage . 
  if i 'd seen that in the new queue i would probably have removed it . 
  given where it is now and how old it is , i 'm less inclined to do so . 
  let me be clear though , that 's only with harmless borderline cases . 
  even still , i 'm tossing up whether to remove it or not right now . 
  the reality is though , that we ca n't see everything and stuff gets past us to the frontpage . 
  only through reports and messages to us can we see more . 
  i get that . 
  just trying to explain it . 
  it 's tough because by nature the rules have to be fairly subjective . 
  that 's part of the intention here , cleaning things up and making it clearer . 
  thanks lexirox . 
  i like you too . 
  you can either post a link or text . 
  self-post is a text-only post . 
  now he changed it back . 
  veeeeeeery sneaky . 
  i mean that there is n't necessarily a need for everyone to know and no big `` incident '' behind it . 
  that 's a good question and it really depends on context and intent . 
  if your post is `` i just made a new website , what do you think ? '', 
  it 's very different to one where someone asks a general question but does n't link to their own advertising . 
  about a week ago . 
  we ca n't make rules about votes since we do n't know who votes and how . 
  i 'm special, 
  bravery = so, 
  in that case , no . 
  what we 're trying to avoid is people tacking on a question to circumvent the rules . 
  we 've asked the sub about it before and the overwhelming majority like the story posts . 
  as long as you 're asking for others ' stories and opinions it 's okay by us . 
  see edit, 
  that was a different subreddit and has nothing to do with us . 
  it was removed once we saw what happened . 
  not at all . 
  we 're worried about protecting the users . 
  yes ? 
  i study psychology . 
  i 've written a [ very long list here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/utthk/scientists_of_reddit_what_misconceptions_do_us/ ) . 
  tl ; dr most things, 
  yes . 
  he would . 
  asked and answered . 
  or / r/asksocialscience if you want a more academic answer, 
   `` who takes the boy to football ? 
  ... how does he go camping and fishing ? '', 
  he told the upper house . 
  wow, 
  i currently see a therapist and am studying to become a clinician . 
  my therapist has told me that he believes no-one should ever practice unless they 've received some amount of therapy themselves . 
  i 'm not sure how it works in your country but in australia , you 're forced to have regular meetings with a senior psychologist for 2 years before you 're fully accredited . 
  sounds like you should go talk to someone . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  i defend his right to say it , there are just repercussions for what he says . 
  i can walk down the straight say `` nigger nigger nigger '' all i like but it 's probably not a smart idea . 
  the sad thing is that he 's being removed because it 's a popular move , not because abbott is trying to get someone for thinly veiled hate speech . 
  [ source ] ( http://news.discovery.com/earth/iceland-volcano-aurora.html ), 
  you 're basically correct . 
  it 's when you 're quoting someone and it 's necessary to make the sentence make sense without context . 
  i 'll give you a really bad example . 
  let 's say i 'm having a press conference where i 'm talking about you and someone wants to quote only one sentence but i say `` he ... '' . 
  if you wanted the quote to make sense independent of the rest of the speech , you could quote it as '' [ fresh_portals ] ... '',

  protagonist = / = immunity from being a villain . 
  the problem is regulation . 
  do you force sterilisation on parents ? 
  do you allow them a certain chance to get therapy/change etc. 
  and/or why do n't we have ** much ** better programs to get people off drugs and train them for work ** while ** they 're on welfare .
