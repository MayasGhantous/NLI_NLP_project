  i 've never been more proud of my friend than when he told me about a time he got drunk and slept with a girl . 
  he woke up at her house and could n't remember her name , after this became obvious to her she asked him and he said that he did n't know . 
  he still slept with her again that morning . 
  he then fell asleep and woke up with her gone , walked into the other room and spent the entire day smoking weed and drinking with her room mates .

  i 'm a psych student and one of the things that comes through in a lot of theories is that we 're pretty terrible at assessing other people 's intentions or circumstances . 
  we tend to attribute what they do to how they personally feel whereas we take context into the equation for us . 
  the moral of the story is that everyone around you has a story about what they 're going through right now and probably is n't being a bitch to you because they dislike you . 
  yeah yeah,

  try to change your perspective to one where you do n't feel like you 're missing out each time you do n't drink but you 're one step closer to what you want .

  `` it 's all relative . '', 
  corollary : most couples will initially resist because it 's not that socially accepted to solicit 3-somes . 
  persist a little bit so that they know you 're serious . 
  i was part of a married couple who travelled to las vegas , hoping we could win enough money to finance my husband 's fantasy real estate project . 
  we placed our money on red in roulette and lost . 
  after gambling away all of our savings , we encountered the billionaire john gage . 
  gage is attracted to me and offers my husband one million dollars to spend a night with me . 
  after a difficult night , we decided to accept the offer , and a contract was signed the next day . 
  gage flew me to a private yacht , and our arrangement was consummated . 
  i did a handful of pepper on a dare . 
  did n't even get money for it . 
  it made me throw up so badly . 
  i like this . 
  probably but i have nothing that can follow that perfect comment . 
  it ended the thread . 
  it 's a combination of many different things ( culturation , familiarity , personal pref ) . 
  everyone is different . 
  first you get the money , then you get the power , then you get the women . 
  yeh , hitler came to power because germany had just had an economic collapse .

  honest self-reflection is the best way to always understand what you want and make sure all parts of you are headed in the same direction . 
  try to pick up a different girl ... just in case . 
  sorry but you 're wrong . 
  what she is talking about is a retrieval error from long-term memory . 
  working memory ( the term short-term memory is n't used anymore - i learned this in my psychology class ) is only for items you are currently rehearsing and have not yet been encoded . 
  ( s ) he is n't talking about forgetting items that ( s ) he has just heard , it 's trying to recover information that has already been learned - long-term memory . 
  serial position effect is about the primacy/recency effect of working memory . 
  there is easily enough scientific knowledge to negate any biblical text for inaccuracy but that does n't stop people believing ( this is n't a judgement ) . 
  we can very easily say the bible is n't true because it 's contrary to what we know about the universe . 
  one more scientific fact probably would n't change much, 
  i finished eating a bowl of cereal and then emptied the milk into the bathroom sink instead of walking to the ( closer ) kitchen . 
  assuming the laws were relatively fair ; better .
