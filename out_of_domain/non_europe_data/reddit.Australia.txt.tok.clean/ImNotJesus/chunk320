  it 's a very difficult line and i do n't think that means the option should be ignored , just very well thought out . 
  down the sterilisation path , what would you say about two parents who have a roughly 50 % chance of having a baby born with an excruciating genetic disorder ? 
  should they be allowed to ` roll the dice ' ? 
  sorry about your mom and uncle . 
  i 'd punch them both if i could . 
  ps : i like your username . 
  also , there ** is ** just a certain amount of luck involved . 
  if i notice a post instantly has 2/3 upvotes , i 'm more likely to look at it than one with none . 
  early momentum is key . 
  especially when it 's something really obviously going to get upvoted too . 
   i know i 'm going to get downvoted for this , but the republicans have lost the plot !, 
  all the while maintaining an air of superiority at how stupid the non-reddit world is . 
  i 'm not sure i understand what you mean . 
  are you saying that it 's discrimination to have an ad about homophobia on during a match ? 
  i know . 
  first they want to help fight racism and now homophobia . 
  what 's next , the afl being against rape too ? 
  this is absurd !, 
  too slow, 
  i decided to turn on the gas that you plug the bunsen burner into and held a lighter to the gas . 
  it made a cool fireball . 
  apparently , that was n't the smartest thing i 've ever done . 
  i 'll have 2 googles and a microsoft please . 
  explain to me how trying to combat homophobia is social engineering and why that 's a bad thing . 
  guy that kept avoiding meeting up with me until 2 days before the project was due . 
  at that point he finally told me that he 'd already promised to work with a friend of his and did n't want to do the wrong thing by him . 
  had to write a 4,000 word paper solo when everyone else had people helping them . 
  grow up . 
  so , let me get this straight . 
  you think that as there 's still a large anti-gay sentiment in a lot of the population , any attempts to change perceptions are nothing more than self-congratulations ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  let 's be clear here . 
  the ad is specifically talking about homophobia . 
  it 's saying that the afl are n't okay with people acting homophobically . 
  i do n't think it 's intolerant to call out people who are homophobic in the same way it is n't intolerant to call out people for being racist . 
  no-one is telling you want to believe or not believe , if you want to believe it 's a `` sin '' or `` gross '' or whatever that 's your choice . 
  what is n't okay is when those beliefs turn into abuse towards another human being . 
  if you * do * abuse your fellow human beings for their sexual orientation or try to deny them equal rights , you deserve to be called a bigot or homophobic . 
  `` it 's not your motherfucking fault . 
  it 's not your motherfucking fault . '', 
  there is n't better data because sexual assault , especially in children , is horrifically under-reported . 
  i 'd love to know how many of those complaints to the church were handed on to the police . 
  genuine question since in other countries that has n't really happened . 
  i 'd be very glad to hear they 've been doing that since they say, 
   `` this submission shows how the church of today is committed to facing up to the truth and to not disguising , diminishing or avoiding the actions of those who have betrayed a sacred trust . '', 
  respect my right to deny others ' rights . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  i was just trying to explain my position based on what i understood from your post . 
  i 'm trying to draw a distinction between what the afl is trying to target - acting harshly towards people because of their sexual orientation - and people having private views . 
  it 's not a given that they were but it can be an indicator . 
  some children do just sexualise younger than others . 
  one important thing to remember though is that there are real researchers who believe this to be the case . 
  now , they 're certainly not the majority and they 're probably going to far in the other direction to counter a pretty considerable over-diagnosis in recent years but this is n't as open and shut as anti-vax . 
  part of the problem is that psychological symptoms exist on a continuum . 
  think of `` feeling down '' . 
  if you feel down a little bit sometimes , that 's normal . 
  if you feel down , all the time , that 's depression . 
  if you feel the exact opposite , it 's mania . 
  ** there is certainly a level of inability to regulate impulsiveness to the point where it 's maladaptive and requires treatment ** . 
  some call it the extreme end of normal development , others call it adhd . 
  the point is that it 's much more complicated than anti-vaxers . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3vjar3mtu1r4ayoxo1_400.jpg ), 
  i agree completely . 
  i 'm just trying to make it clear that psych symptoms are n't generally very cut and dry where it turns into a disorder . 
  i feel like i could clear up ** a lot ** of arguments . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  this is something to talk about with a doctor . 
  same but from australia . 
  also , it 's hilarious . 
  reporting my post does nothing . 
  also , the rule about asking for medical advice are not negotiable . 
  i 'm sorry that it 's difficult for you and i wish you the best of luck . 
  i 'm not trying to hurt you , that rule is in place to protect you * and * the other users . 
  i also get that pop culture reference, 
  the difference is that if it 's a part of ` normal development ' there 's an implication that they 'll ` grow out of it ' . 
  this is a much more complicated debate that i portrayed in the 2 paragraphs i wrote so i do n't want to be strawmanning either side of the debate . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that there ** is ** a legitimate research debate to be had about what level of dysfunction requires medication/a label of mental illness and , like with all psychological symptoms , the spectrum must be considered . 
  from my reading , i do n't think there 's much doubt that there 's a real illness that does require real intervention but there are people who know a lot more than me who feel otherwise . 
  honestly , it 's been about 2 years since i had to read a few papers on it for class so i 'm a little rusty but at the time i was very unimpressed .
