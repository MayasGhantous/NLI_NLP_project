  my old neighbour was n't a nightmare but i 'm pretty sure he was a serial killer . 
  now , let 's be clear , i never saw him kill anyone but ... 
  * he was a 40 year old male who lived alone in an upper middle class area in suburban australia . 
  * he had a large bomb shelter in his backyard and regularly went in there . 
  * he came and left at odd times and none of the other neighbours knew him at all . 
  `` you must be in a lot of pain to be up there and i do n't think i can convince you with one magic sentence but what i can do is stay here as long as it takes to talk to you about why you 're up there . '', 
  note : i 'm trained in suicide intervention and that 's how we were taught to deal with situations . 
  edit : just wanted to add that most [ suicide helplines ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/swresources/comments/c305t/hotline_numbers/ ) are trained to not only deal with suicidal callers but how to train friends/family of people contemplating suicide in how to talk to them about it . 
  if you , or someone you love is at risk , ** please ** make a call . 
  also , that 's almost always a terrible idea as it risks both of your lives . 
  it 's like rule 1 in suicide intervention . 
  incredibly dangerous idea . 
  what if he loses balance and falls ? 
  what if he starts falling and grabs on to you ? 
  rule 1 of suicide intervention is to make sure you do n't put yourself or anyone else in danger . 
  not trying to be an asshole , just letting you know that it 's a really unsafe thing to do . 
  in australia , a country with only 22 million people , someone kills themselves every 4 hours ( on average ) - that works out to be roughly the number of people who died in the september 11 attacks every year . 
  what 's more , the leading cause of death for men aged 18-45 and women from 18-35 is suicide . 
  in fact , studies show that 6 % of australians consider suicide ** every year ** . 
  australia is n't special in that respect - [ here are some worldwide suicide statistics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate#list ) . 
  suicide is the killer that no-one talks about . 
  i did a suicide intervention course just recently and one of my supervisors said something that really stuck with me . 
  he said imagine you 're in a supermarket and looking around , trying to work out who suffers from a mental illness or is currently thinking of suicide . 
  you ca n't do it . 
  you can work out who has a broken leg but when you suffer from mental illness yourself , you do n't realise how many other people are experiencing the exact same thing that you feel right then and there . 
  we 've come a long way in becoming * better * at accepting and talking about mental illness but if your doctor prescribed you some anti-depressants tomorrow , how many people would you tell ? 
  suffering from mental illness or suicidal thoughts is isolating . 
  [ depression lies ] ( http://wilwheaton.net/2012/09/depression-lies/ ) . 
  if you or anyone you know is/has considered suicide , there is help out there . 
  helpline workers are like lifeguards , if you 're suicidal and need immediate help , call out for one . 
  therapists and medication are what teach you how to swim . 
  please , bookmark [ this page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/swresources/comments/c305t/hotline_numbers/ ) so you always know who to call if you start to have thoughts about suicide . 
  if you often feel down , you should seriously consider talking to a psychologist . 
  the evidence says that therapy and/or anti-depressants work for most people . 
  it can be a long and scary road but there is help out there - at the bottom of [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/utthk/scientists_of_reddit_what_misconceptions_do_us/ ) there 's some info on different types of therapy . 
  if you have any questions about calling a helpline or seeing a psychologist , please feel free to pm me . 
  sir , france is bacon . 
  it used to be . 
  freakonomics did an episode on this . 
  they had some experts who suggested that in poorer black communities `` death by cop '' or intentionally dangerous gang behaviour is a more socially acceptable way to kill yourself . 
  it was about a year ago now but they looked at some different numbers and it was fairly amazing . 
  actually the whole suicide episode was really , really good . 
  i 'm going to re-listen right now . 
  edit : the episode is called the suicide paradox and it was released 31/08/11, 
  i 'm not trying to give you a hard time . 
  i do n't really think you 'd yell `` oh look !, 
  it 's a distraction ! '', 
  but i there are people who would try to grab the person . 
  i 'm not trying to tell you off , just make sure people know that it 's dangerous and should n't be done . 
  [ look at the worldwide numbers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate#list ) . 
  australia is fairly middle of the road . 
  i just only know the numbers for here . 
  if you 're wondering why the rates are so high all over the world , i have plenty of theories . 
  i 'm really sorry to hear about your experiences . 
  there are still some terrible mental health workers out there and the ignorance of some of those in related fields is startling . 
  you got some really , really bad advice from people who should 've known better and i 'm sorry about that . 
  i 'll send you a pm so we can discuss it further because there are ** much ** better options out there . 
  ** i 'm by no means an expert ** - i have a psych degree , work at a psych office and do crisis counselling over the phone . 
  i 'm not speaking as a researcher or someone who has done extensive research on the topic , these are just my personal opinions and should be seen as such :, 
  1 ) while we 've come a long way , we still have miles to go in educating the public about mental health issues . 
  people do n't know how to ( a ) identify they have a problem ( b ) know which resources to go to or ( c ) necessarily believe that those resources can help . 
  2 ) there is still a large stigma attached to mental illness - i love [ this picture ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3vjar3mtu1r4ayoxo1_400.jpg ) . 
  beyond the fact that people simply do n't understand or know how to empathise with people in a vulnerable situation , there is still a large subsection of the population that feel like people should be able to just `` snap out '' of feeling down . 
  like it 's some character flaw that they 're depressed . 
  3 ) we do n't talk about mental illness . 
  i have an uncle who recently took an attempt on his life . 
  i know for a that one of his children and two other people in our extended family have suffered from depression but he does n't . 
  i ca n't help but think he would 've felt less alone and scared if he knew that other people understood his experience . 
  4 ) in the social media world we 're constantly bombarded by people showing us [ only their best ] ( http://i.imgur.com/abqoy.jpg ) . 
  this has been an issue for a long time but in no generation has someone who feels sad been more bombarded with pictures of how amazing everyone else 's life is . 
  5 ) people do n't have the language to express how they feel or judge themselves for feeling down , especially men . 
  the number of men i talk to who feel like they are weak or broken because they feel hopeless is staggering . 
  it compounds issues ten-fold . 
  6 ) depression lies . 
  when you feel down , you also feel like those feelings will last forever .
