  they wo n't . 
  there 's a reason they 're there and it wo n't necessarily be easy but there are ways to change it over time . 
  i 'll add more as i think of them .

  i 'm really sorry to hear that and i can understand why it would be jarring . 
  let me start by saying that i 've only encountered people who do the work because they * do really care * . 
  however , in a situation where you 're dealing with incredibly difficult emotions ( from both sides of the call - it can be very emotionally challenging receiving calls sometimes ) people need ways to disengage from some of those feelings . 
  ** they acted incredibly inappropriately ** and we are told to be very , very careful about how and where we talk about the service . 
  at the end of the day , as much as i can see why it would have been incredibly difficult to hear , the reason they were discussing it is ** because ** they care so much . 
  if they were flippant or doing a rehearsed ` act ' it would n't require the same level of debriefing . 
  again , they were inappropriate and i 'm sorry . 
  you understood correctly . 
  having thoughts of suicide is a pretty big warning sign that something is up and you did the right thing seeing a doctor and getting therapy . 
  i 'm really glad that it has helped you .

  i cheated a little . 
  not at all . 
  i completely get why you 'd feel that way hearing it . 
  is there evidence to say that a lower capital gains tax actually improves investment though ? 
  as in , would their be a demonstrable , long-term economic difference if you lowered it to 10 % or raised it to 20 % ( ignoring what would/wouldn ' t be done with that tax revenue ) ? 
  for contrast , in australia capital gains is n't taxed separately at a flat rate . 
  you pay capital gains at the same % as your income tax so for most investors that 's over 40 % . 
  i 'm sorry you had a bad experience . 
  they 're certainly not all perfect . 
  the good thing about them though is if you call back you generally get someone new . 
  i wrote both of them . 
  do you really think i reposted it for more karma or do you think perhaps it 's to get the message out ? 
  it 's called asist . 
  that question clearly breaks rule 3 and i explained that to op . 
  he made a new post and i approved it . 
  really ? 
  do you have a link ? 
  i 'd love to see it . 
  thanks and i did n't know you were being accusatory until i read your response just then . 
  it 's a tricky one because some studies say that you should n't report it . 
  i know lifeline have given a lot of instructions to the news outlets about * how * to report it though , not that they always listen . 
  thank you for your story . 
  i really appreciate it . 
  1 at 18 for me . 
  proper salted caramel, 
  as someone who has seen a psychologist , works with psychologists and has studied psychology i can tell you that your first paragraph is simply wrong . 
  there * are * some bad therapists out there , i 'm not discounting that but studies show that about 75 % of the benefit from therapy is what 's called the `` therapeutic alliance '' which is basically the trust and communication built up between therapist and client . 
  so , any therapist worth anything , will ** not ** be working off a script at all and i do n't believe most do . 
  what you may be referring to is hardcore cbt which is somewhat more inflexible and rigid and some therapists do work in that way . 
  however , most accept that cbt is n't the fix-all that some feel it is . 
  as for me , i 'm about to start my honours degree ( it works slightly differently in australia ) but currently do work in the field . 
  actually , you 're not far from the truth . 
  one difference often found between depression sufferers and non-depression sufferers is a lack of an optimism bias . 
  there 's good and bad to it but this is more of a proof of concept . 
  no-one is talking about cutting the optimism bias out of someone 's brain . 
  we make some ** very ** stupid decisions because of it ( see gambling , eating unhealthy food ) but it also seems to be important for day to day happiness ( depression sufferers often show less or no optimism bias ) . 
  the point is that the more we understand about how different modules in the brain work , the better we can understand the brain as a whole and what happens when it 's damaged ( physically or neurochemically ) . 
   label the behavior as unacceptable , but the kid as still lovable . 
  i love that quote . 
  that 's adorable !, 
  i think we need to run an experiment .

  be there for him , listen non-judgementally but get him to go talk to someone .

  i 'm not saying that it has no purpose , i do n't know the research well enough to argue either side . 
  i 'm saying that the pro-weed part of reddit are out of control . 
  hey , hey , that 's above the belt . 
  obestie would 've also been acceptable . 
   in other words , `` depression '' as clinically defined is actually an objectively derived reasonable and balanced view . 
  i did n't say that . 
  go ask the doctor, 
  learn to meditate . 
  the physical and mental health benefits are very well established and it 's a great stress reliever .

  amazing effort guys !,

  because you 're applying different amounts of heat to the inside and the outside of the steak while cooking . 
  if they both start at a lower temperature , it will take much longer to warm the middle of steak meaning that you 're likely to undercook it or cook the outside for too long . 
  you really should have all meats you cook with at room temperature ( if possible ) before cooking as it gives you the best control over your temps . 
  edit : here are heston blumenthal 's steps * before * cooking a steak . 
  1 ) leave it on a cake rack over a tray in the fridge for 2 days - this dries it out . 
  2 ) leave out for a couple of hours to get to room temperature . 
  3 ) season with table salt and ** not ** pepper as the pepper will burn . 
  interestingly , he cooks steak quite differently to most .
