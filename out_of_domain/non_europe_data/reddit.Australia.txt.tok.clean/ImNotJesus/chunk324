  he uses a super hot pan and turns the steak every 10 to 15 seconds . 
  the idea is that the side that is n't cooking cools down very quickly and that 's where a lot of the heat is lost . 
  if you turn it constantly , without giving it a chance to cool , you keep the temperature up in the middle while cooking the outside nicely . 
  and , of course , the ** most ** important part of cooking any piece of meat . 
  rest it before you cut it open . 
  it can and does but that does n't really matter in this case . 
  the rules are very clear and they 're in place to protect the users . 
  this rule is n't negotiable . 
  if he wants to do research on another subreddit , that 's his prerogative . 
  hey aleruiz108 , your post has been removed from public listings because it breaks either rules 1 , 2 , or both . 
  we ask of submitters to ask a valid question in their title that is non-rhetorical , thought provoking or discussion-inspiring to the commentators of our reddit . 
  you could try posting in / r/self or / r/misc , two reddits with fewer guidelines on posting . 
  an inability to be challenged ( gently and with tact ) . 
  what if the code is `` wink back if i should eat my own vomit again '', 
  [ here ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120926094544.htm ) is the sciencedaily write-up on the paper . 
  text her more . 
  it 's starting to work . 
  you 're wearing her down . 
  it was a shock picture and he has been banned for spamming . 
  give it a gogh, 
  but really , who can afford the buck ` o'five to buy some ? 
  i 'd settle for any of the naked mole-rat 's [ super powers ] ( http://the-scientist.com/2012/06/01/underground-supermodels/ ), 
  i 've had deep-fried mars bars in australia . 
  it was pretty amazing . 
  that 's a really clever reply . 
  thanks for your help trevor, 
  are you starting with a good base ? 
  always start by frying up some carrots , celery , onion and garlic . 
  i agree on the peanut butter cups but salty/sweet is a taste sensation . 
  do n't write it off . 
  maybe you could post the recipe/steps and we might be able to work out what you could be doing better . 
  ... and now we 've hit the front page . 
  there are a lot more people who will simply give an outraged upvote than people who wait to see if something is actually true before spreading a story that involves people 's full names . 
  just ... so ... brave, 
  have you had a good salted caramel ? 
  orgasmic .

  no because science . 
  you are your brain . 
  when your brain stops receiving oxygenated blood , you stop being you . 
  there is no extra part that can float away . 
  i diagnosed myself with hysterical pregnancy . 
  the doctor said i was wrong but i 'm sticking to my guns because i know i 'm right . 
  yeah that 's a pretty huge slap in the face , especially if you 've asked him not to . 
  [ it 's a boy ] ( http://i2.listal.com/image/1559486/500full.jpg ), 
  was it a nice frame ? 
  to be fair , your mother smells fantastic . 
  thank you for saying that . 
  i just woke up and that really confused me . 
  nazi party, 
  i do n't get the relevance of him being black to the story . 
  this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , medical consultation , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . 
  also , that 's an obscenely stupid idea . 
  it 's medical advice because it 's a fucking stupid , unhealthy idea that could do serious damage . 
  go talk to your doctor . 
  the same reason that some people find action movies entertaining and other find them inane or some can like dubstep while i think it sounds like a mechanical chicken being tortured . 
  a combination of personal differences , what you 're used to and previous good experiences in that context . 
  tl ; dr different people are different . 
  the rabbi called my auntie by the wrong name . 
  what 's worse , he called her a man 's name . 
  and erection crushing . 
  the last one was caught red-handed . 
  donated blood a couple of days ago . 
  pretty sure they 're really vampires . 
  * rational, 
  for your cakeday , i want you to read the rules of the subreddit before posting . 
  / r/nofap are fucking insane . 
  please do n't listen to them . 
  also , this is a medical question so i have to remove it . 
  seriously though , there 's nothing wrong wtih it . 
  just do n't grip too hard or use anything too abrasive . 
  exactly . 
  there 's considerable profit to be made with all those hungry people . 
  holy shit . 
  i just realised that my username often relates to the post i 'm making . 
  mind ... blown . 
  that would be fine . 
  it may be trite but nothing restores my faith in humanity more than seeing a little baby giggle or smile at you . 
  i genuinely believe that all people are born good and wanting to do great things . 
  when i see a baby being joyous , it reminds me of the potential we all have . 
  thanks pal . 
  i miss you too, 
  / r/happy is lovely, 
  how is calling it a wand literal ? 
  correct . 
  ab are universal donors so my plasma will be used in the er !, 
  let 's say you 're an awesome fighter and hit the guy 10 times and only got hit once . 
  that 's still 1 more time than i 'm willing to get hit just to hurt some drunken asshole who i 'll never see again . 
   sex does n't have ** to have ** any deep meaning . 
  but it can . 
  i would n't trade sleeping with my partner once for fucking the 10 hottest girls i 've ever met . 
  it 's just different . 
  that 's not to say meaningless fucking is n't nice , but there are different levels you can enjoy sex on . 
  that does n't detract from your overall point but i felt like it needed to be said . 
  pop-up books, 
  why must there be a meaning ? 
  why must there be a reason ? 
  not sure but it ends with our sun not working anymore . 
   sure it may not be physically addicting ,,
