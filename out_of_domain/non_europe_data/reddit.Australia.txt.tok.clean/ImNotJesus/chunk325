  that 's not actually true . 
  recent evidence shows physical withdrawal symptoms . 
  surgeons do n't just not do free surgeries because they 're greedy and want more money , it 's because an operating theatre , anaesthetist , nurses , equipment etc. 
  is fucking expensive . 
  [ link to original paper ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1640 ), 
  `` where do you think we are '', 
  gut punch . 
  tears . 
  fuck , i just watched it again and i 'm covered in goosebumps . 
  i 've seen this episode at least 10 times and it still really hits me every time . 
  it 's one of the best episodes of television i 've ever seen . 
  joss whedon is known for his gut-punching moments but nothing really rivals the moment when [ buffy finds her mother dead ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6a0whqspfi ) . 
  it was unceremonious and unrelentingly quiet . 
  and then there 's the flashback that all of a sudden becomes her lifeless face . 
  i 've never seen a more brutal episode about death . 
  there 's no escape from the intensity of it . 
  i 'm sorry for your loss . 
  with that shirt he looks more like bobby b, 
  realistically , screaming and crying with a few panic attacks thrown in . 
  i think you mean cliche . 
  clique makes the sentence quite different . 
  no because science, 
  not for plasma, 
  i 'm not being a grammar nazi , they 're completely different words . 
  i was just trying to help you . 
  a high marble score piece of real wagyu , cooked by someone who knows what they 're doing , with a side of chips with truffle salt and some bernaise sauce . 
  say what you want about the way he treats people , the dude not only knows how to cook but how to teach and write recipes . 
  not all chefs at his level also have the ability to produce as many videos/books as he had and maintain such a high level . 
  spoiler alert : nothing . 
  the last 100 years of neuroscience has shown us definitively that the mind is what the brain does . 
  once your brain stops receiving oxygenated blood , there is no more you . 
  i 'm not trying to discount anyone 's spiritual beliefs but the science is very , very clear . 
  there 's a big difference between our definitions of being dead here . 
  completely agree and it 's the exact same thing that comes up in free will arguments . 
  the fact that all behaviours have a physical basis does n't make one any less responsible for their actions , it just means we need to understand those actions in a different way . 
  whether x is a paedophile because of a brain abnormality or not , i still do n't want him free in society . 
  you 're not david eagleman 's reddit account are you ? 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  jeff buckley 's cover of most things is better than the original . 
  statistically he probably has a different blood type and i guess he could have some sort of defect . 
  munch my coochie ( slang for vagina ), 
  i hate that reddit as a whole pats itself on the back for being courageously pro-science but your posts are subject to extreme downvoting if you present scientific information that does n't jibe with the general consensus around here ( weed is bad for you , spanking is terrible parenting etc. ), 
  breaking rules 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 all in one go . 
  impressive . 
  also , you 've been banned for posting personal information . 
  i make it illegal for people to sell medicine with no scientific , peer-reviewed evidence to support it 's safety and efficacy . 
  we have an expectation in all areas that a product you buy will fulfill the purpose you bought it for ( a chair has to be able to actually hold your weight ) . 
  why , in the field where we should have the ** highest ** standards , do we allow people to make a career out of selling products that do n't just not work but also cause significant harm ? 
  i do n't understand why people are n't angry about that all of the time . 
  so ... rape ? 
  edit : it 's gone from rape to just creepy . 
  yay ? 
  you want to force women to evaluate you in a certain way ? 
  why the fuck should n't a woman be allowed to be shallow if she wants to be ? 
  how do you define harming humanity ? 
  driving my car damages the environment which in turn harms humanity . 
  so ... no taxes ? 
  does my girlfriend now belong to me ? 
  if not , sex is going to be challenging . 
   rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse , which is initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person 's consent . 
  the act may be carried out by physical force , coercion , abuse of authority or with a person who is incapable of valid consent , such as a person who is unconscious or incapacitated . 
  still rape , even if it 's `` legal '' . 
  i think the golden rule is a good but not perfect rule . 
  not everyone wants to be treated the same way that i do . 
  for example , i like when my friends tease me , i find it funny . 
  not all people want to be treated that way . 
  instead , why ca n't it just be, 
   treat people as they would have you treat them, 
  i have no problem with jokes . 
  this just is n't funny unless you 're a sexually frustrated 14 year old telling your friend `` would n't it be awesome if girls just had to blow me '' . 
  you 're free to say whatever you like , you just sound like an idiot . 
  that 's what she said, 
  yay . 
  another rape law . 
  how hilarious . 
  i do n't see 10 mosquitos on most days . 
  what 's the punishment if i do n't kill any ? 
  edit : just killed 1 , 9 to go . 
  considering my partner had malaria 3 times as a child , i take a lot of joy in their slaughter . 
  you seem really angry . 
  i do n't know which part is worse . 
  not even close but it 's pretty cute that you 're so proud of yourself right now . 
  pfffft of course * you * would think that 's a good law . 
  it may be harder to define but how about dogmatism of all forms , instead of organised religion . 
  organised religion is one form of dogmatism that currently damages our government . 
  technically , placebos do n't do anything . 
  if they did , they would n't be a placebo , they 'd be an active medicine . 
  the placebo does n't do anything , the suggestion does . 
  edit : let me be clear . 
  i 'm not denying that the placebo effect exists . 
  i 'm saying that the placebo item itself is an item that has no innate effect . 
  the sugar pill has no effect , the expectation that it will has the effect . 
  if the sugar pill itself had an effect , it would n't be a placebo . 
  the point is that there 's no good reason why we should allow charlatans to sell unproven medicines under the guise of being a placebo . 
  hold on , i never said that you have to do everything that anyone wants from you all the time . 
  that 's a big leap from trying to consider how people want to be treated and trying to treat them in that way . 
  the placebo ** effect ** is a thing . 
  that does n't mean the placebo itself is a thing . 
  by its nature , the placebo is an intervention that has no innate effect . 
  if it * had * an effect , it would n't be a placebo .
