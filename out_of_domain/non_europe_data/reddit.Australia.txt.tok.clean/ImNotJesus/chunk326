  let me be clear . 
  i 'm not denying that the placebo effect exists . 
  i 'm saying that the placebo item itself is in itself an item that has no innate effect . 
  the sugar pill has no effect , the expectation that it will does . 
  if the sugar pill itself had an effect , it would n't be a placebo . 
  you 're not really getting my point here and we 're arguing over semantics . 
  the point is that there 's no good reason why we should allow charlatans to sell unproven medicines under the guise of being a placebo . 
   the tendency to lay down principles as incontrovertibly true , without consideration of evidence or the opinions of others . 
  if your version of patriotism fits into that banner , i would say that it 's harmful to discourse . 
  right !, 
  now we 're on the same page . 
  yeah , i have no problems with that . 
  nope . 
  there are very different rules for pharmaceuticals and `` alternative '' medicines . 
  homeopathy literally has no active ingredient . 
  oh my god . 
  the pill itself has no natural effect . 
  if the pill had a natural effect , it would n't be a placebo , it would be an active ingredient . 
  the fact that there * was * an effect , is a ** psychological ** factor based on ** expectations ** of the pill . 
  it has nothing to do with what is/isn ' t inside the pill itself . 
  the pill has no effect . 
  the psychology behind believing it does have an effect , has the effect . 
  yes but i do n't see why we , as a society , should be okay with that snake oil salesman making a career out endangering lives with said snake oil . 
  i have several problems with that :, 
  1 ) those providing the placebo have inadequate training to discern whether real medical attention is needed . 
  2 ) the consumer should have a right to know they 're being deceived . 
  3 ) why should someone be able to take people 's hard earned money by deceiving them into believing that they 're receiving proper medical care ? 
  yes and if someone who presented them self as someone in the medical field told you those sugar pills were real contraceptives . 
  you 'd be fairly annoyed , i 'd think . 
  it does because they 're not a medicine . 
  they are , in fact , a lack of medicine . 
  red one . 
  blue one . 
  you 're not that special . 
  the world does n't care about you . 
  sorry , but it 's the truth . 
  make your own decisions and do n't look outwards for `` signs '' . 
  why would i care ? 
  if two consenting adults love each other , i 'm happy for them . 
  mostly good but incredibly over-dramatic and often warped in your sense of what 's important . 
   hmm , our economy is fucked and our healthcare system is a joke . 
  let 's all argue about gay marriage for a few years . 
  also , you fetishise this idea of `` freedom '' to the point where you sacrifice equality and access to basic rights . 
  the idea that anyone can have `` the american dream '' if they want it/work hard enough is ridiculous and it leads to this idea that anyone who does n't achieve at a certain level is necessarily at fault . 
  my incredible humility . 
  that 's a lot of commas for a grammar nazi . 
  my penis, 
  you 're kind of right . 
  we 're the cousins of modern monkeys , not a descendant . 
  inevitable death = nothing ever matters ? 
  i guess i should never go see a movie since it will inevitably end . 
  during the night i have a tendency to roll towards her and then snore loudly in her face . 
  did you post this question because you thought you had a really funny answer ? 
  you did n't . 
  thanks , i 've been working out . 
  i used to use vegemite as a pasta sauce . 
  just vegemite and butter . 
  paranormal :, 
   denoting events or phenomena such as telekinesis or clairvoyance that are beyond the scope of normal scientific understanding . 
  nothing . 
  worked out that i was born 9 months to the day after my dad 's 30th birthday . 
  edit : actually , i know ** heaps ** about my dad that i wish i did n't know because he has no boundaries . 
  i know that he cheated on his most recent girlfriend by getting a happy ending massage ( which he does n't consider cheating ) . 
  oh , i also know that that girlfriend blew him the first time they met . 
  note : we do n't have a good relationship at all , he just has no fucking idea what 's appropriate conversation with your children . 
  watchtower at pearl harbour, 
  thanks !, 
  yup, 
  it 's a tough line and we 've had many discussions about it as a mod group . 
  as a general rule , we try to moderate the type of questions we receive but not the comments . 
  this is because moderating questions is essential to make sure the sub is pointed in the right direction but moderating comments stops discussion . 
  luckily 99 % of the time , the upvotes/downvotes take care of the shitty comments and it 's not an issue . 
  unfortunately , in those 1 % , we have a difficult line to draw with what comments should be allowed and we tend to err on the side of trusting the sub . 
  yes , best not waste your outrage quota for the day . 
  schizoid refers to a personality disorder wherein the sufferer has a lack of interest in social relationships combined with intense coldness of emotion and apathy . 
  schizophrenic was n't right either but i never miss a chance to educate people about mental illness !, 
  [ wiki on schizoid personality disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schizoid_personality_disorder ), 
  was at a music festival that had a whole bunch of different stages . 
  at one of those stages , they had a `` jam session '' that you could sign up for and they 'd match you with people who play other instruments . 
  you get 5 minutes to chat and then you go play on stage for the crowd . 
  i decided to be brave and give it a shot . 
  i 'd been learning drums for a little while and although i had n't played with other people before , i did n't think it would be any different . 
  well , the song starts and i ca n't keep time for shit . 
  the more out of time i get , the more embarrassed i get and the worse my playing is . 
  it culminated in the lead singer signalling to stop the song so he could turn around and click the timing of the beat for me . 
  swing and a miss there buddy . 
  it has everything reddit loves besides a picture of ndt 's head next to some text . 
  cool !, 
  til, 
  i never said that . 
  i was trying to provide potential context . 
  that would be so frustrating when people assume that means you have did . 
  how about if the top comment is a funny , well-executed joke that some would consider sexist/racist . 
  should we remove that ? 
  because schizophrenia is a complex disorder with * varied symptoms . 
  most people actually mean dissociative identity disorder when they say schizophrenic . 
  surely her whole office would know she 's a bitch already right ? 
  no matter how well/badly he treats her , if i heard someone talking about their partner like that i 'd avoid them like the fucking plague . 
  most things are worse than buttsex, 
  blowjob,
