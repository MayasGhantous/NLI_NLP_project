  you do realise how silly you sound right ? 
  you 'll sound much less silly if you just admit you were wrong instead of backing yourself further and further into a corner . 
  no shame in being wrong every now and then . 
  my second toe is significantly longer than my big toe . 
  it 's actually a problem because to fit into normal shoes that toe has to curl up and the nail gets knocked off every few months as a result . 
  [ best chandler line ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoiqkbgggke ), 
  i was going to post this as well . 
  sex is fun but sex never seems more important than when you 're not having it . 
  it 's good , it 's better when it 's with someone you love but it certainly did n't change my life the way i thought it would as a virgin . 
  it 's both feet and that would just mean that the rest of my foot was uncomfortable . 
  i was going to say the next line `` i 've got all my life to live '' but then spent the next 5 minutes trying to work out whether that 's redundant or simply false . 
  it either means `` i 'll live until i 'm not living '' or `` i have the full span of my life ahead of me '' . 
  i do n't know why i 'm telling you all this but the question is now plaguing me . 
  yes there are different iq tests . 
  the most common one is called the [ wais ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wechsler_adult_intelligence_scale ) ( note : if you were 9 you probably took the wisc though ) . 
  the first thing i need to tell you is that iq tests are re-normed every so often . 
  the reason for that is the ` flynn effect ' which basically shows that iqs get higher over time ( this is primarily due to better nutrition , education and parental literacy ) . 
  so , for the average to remain at 100 , it has to be harder to score 100 . 
  so , scoring does change over time . 
  the same answers that scored you 100 on the wais iii would score you well below the mean on the wais iv . 
  as for a maximum score , there may be one on crappy online tests but as far as i know the maximum score on the wais is far higher than 160 . 
  plus , the whole place already has a sepia filter . 
  [ stein reporting the same ] ( https://twitter.com/espnsteinline/status/262384250853138432 ), 
   the rockets send kevin martin , jeremy lamb and future draft considerations to the thunder for harden , sources tell y !, 
  sports . 
  [ stein also reporting a deal is close to done ] ( https://twitter.com/espnsteinline/status/262384250853138432 ), 
   as part of deal , thunder will receive `` significant '' future draft picks from houston , source tells y !, 
  sports . 
   kevin martin is an extremely efficient scorer, 
  he shot 41 % from the field last year . 
  i 'm so glad for you because you did n't have enough fall into your lap this offseason already . 
  it will certainly take some pressure off lin . 
  i 've removed the post . 
  please do n't repost it tomorrow . 
  i 'm sorry for your situation but it 's simply not appropriate here . 
  the ninja was the highlight . 
  everyone needs res . 
  the same can be said for all journalism these days . 
  that 's the nature of internet news . 
  first person to break the story gets their name on it until tomorrow when the story is forgotten . 
  but hey , at least people will retweet it a few times and you pick up a few extra twitter followers in the process . 
   that 's why people date , so they can find out if they are compatible . 
  it 's amazing how many people do n't realise that . 
  my best friend and his wife decided to both hyphenate . 
  i think it 's pretty cute . 
  i seek an amendment to how others see ron paul 's little libertarian tots of bravery,

  it could mean all sorts of things and it can be a symptom of a larger issue like a sleep disorder . 
  it 's unlikely but still worth raising with your doctor if you have any other unusual sleep symptoms ( excessive sleepiness during the day , sleep paralysis , insomnia , hypersomnia etc. ), 
  [ medicalxpress article on the study ] ( http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-11-cannabis-mimics-cognitive-weakness-schizophrenia.html ), 
  reinforcement is operationally defined as a stimulus that causes a behaviour to be more likely to be reproduced . 
  it can be positive reinforcement ( adding a positive stimulus ) like a delicious taste or negative reinforcement ( removing a negative stimulus ) like avoiding a scary height . 
  reward does n't have the same meaning in the psychology literature . 
  do n't have time to read the paper but based off the title , i 'm assuming that they 're talking about the [ reward system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reward_system ) . 
  sorry , i was showing my psych bias . 
  neuroscience talk about reward systems , psychologists talk about reinforcement .

  edit : damn , you fixed it before my post went up . 
  i 'll leave my shame here . 
  dog 's tail never stops wagging, 
  terrifying . 
  and why not try to run some off-ball plays for harden and give him some easier shots ? 
  i 'm getting so frustrated watching his 1-4s, 
  i want to see nothing but dragic/gortat pnr . 
  if not , who better to learn off than al pumperson himself ? 
  as someone who enjoys watching the lakers suffer , i really hope they go after dunleavy . 
  to make me happy ? 
  i really wish they spent more time talking about the construction of plays and what happens off the ball . 
  why did a play work ? 
  why did it fail ? 
  what defensive schemes are being used ? 
  i really wish i knew what happens when a man 's hands are down . 
  i will not eat until i find a cure for my anorexia . 
  the way the rules work in australia ( for insurance purposes ) is that if you hit someone in front of you , it 's basically your fault no matter what ( unless they reverse obviously ) . 
  you 're supposed to leave enough room that you have time to react and stop irrespective of what happens in front of you . 
  i love games on ( their ) sunday too as an australian . 
  i get to wake up to a game about to start !, 
  can someone explain to me why odom was playing so deep in the 2nd quarter and dj did n't come back sooner ? 
  he only had 2 though , no reason to keep him out for 10 minutes in the 2nd . 
  good call on the dickishness , that 's why i had celts bottom for me . 
  i find heinsohn to be painful . 
  i think he realises , i just do n't think he cares . 
  all i can ever think is `` l train '', 
  to be fair , who has n't wanted to yell at sean elliot ? 
  we 're talking about a guy who constantly referred to odom as `` mr kardashian '' , what a douchebag . 
  depends the era defending them . 
  put wilt against the athletes of today and there 's no way he scores the same . 
  if it 's modern defenders , i think it has to be mj or durant . 
  if it 's their own era , it 's wilt . 
  please , can we have a steady flow of durant touches . 
  he 'll have alonzo freaking gee on him ( no offence cavs fans ) . 
  i like gee and he is solid but he 's giving up 5 inches and i think it 's a good matchup for kd . 
  not saying sean elliott was wrong in this case , i 'm saying that i find him to be an obnoxious commentator and his `` mr kardashian '' routine was completely distasteful . 
  spot on . 
  our separation of church and state is [ much weaker than most think ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_116_of_the_constitution_of_australia ) . 
   each justice in the majority contrasted section 116 with its equivalent in the us constitution to find that section 116 is narrower . 
  the court noted that the us constitution prohibits laws respecting `` establishment of religion '' generally , whereas the prohibition in section 116 is against the establishment of `` any religion '' : this meant that section 116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally ; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion . 
  was that supposed to be a zinger ? 
  i get what you 're saying but in some respects it gives the commission more credibility . 
  everyone knows that they 're going to be looking at the catholic church more than any other organisation but it sets up the commission to be about trying to stamp out institutionalised child and not about what the catholic church did/didn ' t do .
