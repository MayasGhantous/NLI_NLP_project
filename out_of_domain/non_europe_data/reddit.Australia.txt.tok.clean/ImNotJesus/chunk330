  regrets , i have a few . 
  i 've found it 's the same thing with really long comments . 
  time after time , i 've written long and well-researched comments only to have them summarily ignored by those looking for the quick joke or easy pun . 
  that 's why i try to always make sure there 's something to get the attention of the user to make them go back and read my whole paragraph . 
  tl ; dr do n't stick your dick into crazy, 
  i upvoted you to see your reaction . 
  i 'm not going insane right ? 
  this has been on the frontpage several times in the last few weeks right ? 
  something something sperm whale something, 
   kids these days are dumb enough to smoke and drive ~ ~ without even looking around ... ~ ~, 
  if you drive stoned you 're a fucking asshole . 
  fuck you . 
  i really hate the whole op is a faggot thing . 
  i get it , it 's an old 4chan thing but it 's pretty fucked up and should be met with downvotes every time . 
  you do n't , you 're an asshole who believes your own bullshit . 
  it 's one thing to put yourself in danger it 's a whole other thing to risk the lives of those around you . 
  hypochondria should be treated by a mental health professional and not fake treatments that ignore the bigger issue . 
  the most frustrating thing about srs is that it could 've been a really good subreddit . 
  i was so excited when i found it because i thought it would be a great place to vent about the absurd opinions that become popular sometimes on reddit . 
  unfortunately , it 's nothing like that . 
  the worst part of / r/politics is that they complain about how biased and unprofessional fox news is while allowing self-posts and blogs to hit the frontpage . 
  or a somatization disorder which is distinct from hypochondriasis . 
  have you considered not using that subreddit that you do n't like ? 
  i know it sounds crazy but i 've found spacedicks really does n't affect me when i do n't open it . 
  the two mosquitoes carried the malaria . 
  deer with it . 
  i love jokes the best when i know the punchline before the setup . 
  takes out that pesky surprise element . 
  have sex with a girl i really did n't like/respect and was n't attracted to . 
  except for the fact that the frontpage of bangbros.com makes it ** very ** clear that it 's a porn site ( i just checked , for science ) . 
  this is faker than a porn orgasm . 
  i 've removed your post because you 're asking for medical advice and it is n't appropriate on askreddit . 
  i really , really recommend you talk to a doctor and/or a therapist about a lot of this stuff because you could do irreparable damage to yourself . 
  anorexia is a very serious and very dangerous disorder and should be treated as such . 
  no big deal about the rule but i am a bit worried about you . 
  anorexia or not , it sounds like you 're going through a really tough time at the moment and it could help to talk to someone . 
  if you do n't want to , that 's okay , i just think it could n't hurt . 
  as for your doctor , please find a new one . 
  your old one is borderline criminally negligent telling you that it 's okay to not eat . 
  seriously , do n't go back to him . 
  glad to hear it . 
  take care of yourself , okay ? 
  pm me if you need . 
  is it wrong that i 'm glad about the confederate flag one ? 
  my favourite part is the mike 's hard lemonade in the background . 
  it makes him look like a ginger robin williams, 
  it 's the homeopathy approach . 
  maybe a small amount of taylor swift can cure all relationship problems . 
  it 's more accurate than lol in most cases but i 'm not sure if it 's as catchy . 
  each time i hit a 50k mark , there 's joy mixed with questions of what i 'm doing with my life . 
  valid on both , i 'll edit for clarity . 
  see edit . 
  have n't done enough reading on it to have an opinion , sorry . 
  yes, 
  since my all-time favourite quote was on the frontpage a few days ago ( the mark twain one about death ) , i 'll use my second favourite . 
   well , i guess i kinda worked it out . 
  if there 's no great glorious end to all this , if nothing we do matters ... , then all that matters is what we do . 
  'cause that 's all there is . 
  what we do . 
  now . 
  today . 
  it 's actually from an episode of angel when he realises that there 's no higher purpose for him . 
   many people who do spank their children spank out of anger and not out of genuine , effective discipline . 
  those are the people these studies focus on . 
  translation : i choose to believe things are a certain way and when the evidence suggests otherwise i try to find reasons why it 's wrong with no evidence basis . 
  i 'm not telling you what to think or do but at least be intellectually honest about it . 
  uhhh no , you learn that in high school . 
  i 'm not sure what terrible college/university you go to that teaches grammar/spelling . 
  is there a particular typo/error you take issue with ? 
  it is a side-effect of some medications but it 's definitely something to talk to your prescribing doctor about . 
  the rules are what we aspire to create for the subreddit . 
  unfortunately , with 2.5 million users and us only being volunteers , it 's impossible to monitor all the content that comes through . 
  we remove ** a lot ** of content ( you do n't realise how many offending posts you do n't see ) but the fact is that some gets through the gaps . 
  however , you guys can help us by, 
  * reporting content that does n't fit within the rules . 
  * messaging the mods when there 's a violation of 4 with a link to the post . 
  * downvoting inappropriate content so it does n't reach the front page . 
  * informing users of the rules they 're in violation of when you see a bad post . 
  also , if you feel the rules need any changes , you can always feel free to message us with suggestions . 
  lastly , i feel the need to point out that your only post besides this was :, 
   what would your `` last meal '' be ? 
  do you really feel like * that * needs more attention ? 
  never heard of it sorry and it seems to be buddhism related . 
  can you tell me specifically what the claim was ? 
  in all fairness , i think he lost balance from the small nudge because he was backpedaling . 
  i do n't think it was a foul or a flop . 
  ca n't put it on bestof because they do n't allow from defaults . 
  someone already posted it on [ defaultgems ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/defaultgems/comments/13hdzz/imnotjesus_clarifies_misconceptions_about/ ) though, 
  how would you word a real that gets rid of repeat questions ? 
  mail the suggestion to the mod group and we can discuss it . 
  do you mean a `` what is consciousness ? '', 
  sort of book or things that talk about the nature of our consciousness - why do we experience the world the way we do ? 
  not sure sorry , have n't done a lot of reading on the area . 
  not sure how to take that, 
  i think you misread what i said . 
  medi ** t ** ation, 
  i 'd be happy to explain why you 're wrong but i do n't think you 're really that interested . 
  how are you defining `` not as scientific '' ? 
  psychology is peer-reviewed and uses the same methodologies as the hard sciences to find results . 
  of course , there are limitations in studying humans , as there is in medicine , which is why the need for high standards of scientific method use are even more important .
