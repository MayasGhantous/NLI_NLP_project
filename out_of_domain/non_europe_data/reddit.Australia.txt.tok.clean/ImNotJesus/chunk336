  it 's irrelevant whether a group discriminates against a minority when discussing whether they should be allowed to raise money on campus or not ? 
  that 's insane . 
  no , i should n't be banned for campus but it should affect whether i can raise money for my discriminatory practices . 
  `` a few seconds ago '', 
  screenshot , delete , attain reddit karma . 
  sure . 
  i 'd love to see the responses . 
  it 's funny that you keep ranting about how this is all a ploy by atheists when you 're the ** only one ** in the whole thread talking about religion . 
  we 're all talking about discrimination , you 're the one making it a religious issue . 
  first amendment means you can say what you want , it does n't mean that you 're immune to the consequences of it . 
  i have the * right * to go tell my boss that he 's a cunt but that does n't mean that there are no ramifications . 
  they 've made their stand and now the berkeley students have done the same . 
  ** that 's the whole point of free speech ** , you dingus . 
  what are you basing that on ? 
  which are ? 
  you 're blowing me away with your evidence that it 's a religious issue . 
  wow has anyone read the comments ? 
  and if it truly affects their care they should do something about it . 
  sa are being intolerant here , not the students . 
  it 's on the 3rd page under voluntary experience . 
  chill out buddy . 
  i 've been asked about it a few times in interviews and i 'm honest about what it entails . 
  i 'm not sure if people are downvoting you because they think you 're just an / r/atheism circlejerker but what you 're saying * is * statistically true . 
  atheists do donate more money on average to charity . 
  that 's not to say atheists are better people ( and it 's probably better explained by ses ) but it 's not just circlejerking, 
  it * being * a religious organisation does n't mean that that 's the motivation for the move . 
  whether or not it is one is n't in doubt . 
  well if their spokesman told a partisan website that ... 
  * and * their dad . 
  i saw you in melbourne and had one of the best nights of my life but it seemed like parts of the audience did n't get your style . 
  do you often find that you get audiences who have n't experienced a comic like you ? 
  editted . 
  let 's say it 's a run of the mill house auction . 
  the post was removed and the user was banned . 
  if it continues , the admins will be informed and they will hand out more significant punishments . 
  oh my god , your mom knows that you have pubic hair . 
  australian money . 
  it 's worth more than your money . 
  25 , to be fair . 
  wait in the first picture the guy in the red shirt 's wrist is circled but then it zooms in on hers . 
  i realise that but it 's still an odd way to show it .

  how is having a subreddit devoted to atheism that people are n't forced to visit having it `` shoved down their throats '' ? 
  i think / r/atheism is obnoxious as the next guy but this is a stupid argument . 
  it 's really not that subtle at all . 
  no no , there was light on the first day . 
  there 's just no explanation where it came from . 
  hustle is important but it 's a symptom of other things being wrong . 
  more than anything , i think that people are penetrating * way * too easily against the lakers and i do n't see how having nash back is going to help . 
  so glad to help . 
  there are also social workers and many others . 
  as it was i was going ** very ** long . 
  i 'm not sure i understand which part you 're disagreeing with . 
  not really , no . 
  good hypnotism is basically a really good guided meditation . 
  because their scientific basis is generally non-existent, 
  that 's the same as in australia but psycholoists are heavily subsidised if you get a referral from your doctor . 
   in general . 
  most are , some are n't . 
  no sir . 
  otherwise , there are some brilliant books . 
  i 'd start with mindsight by daniel j siegel, 
  well said . 
  i agree in general . 
  however , the vast majority are still crap and there is n't nearly enough filter from some random guy 's thought to book on the shelf . 
  see the note at the top . 
  i 've used aba when i worked briefly with autistic kids . 
  it 's very good . 
  see the note . 
  i 've worked with autistic kids using aba and it 's great . 
  i was trying to appeal to a mass audience . 
  well said and if i was writing the entire post on the psychologist/iatrist distinction i would 've tried to cover that . 
  i was trying to do my best to describe in broad strokes the differences and i know i left out a lot of key info, 
  watch the tv show in treatment . 
  ah i assumed you were going the other way with it . 
  love it,

  unfortunately , several times more people will see this title than those who read the comments and see the actual story . 
  actually , you 're right - http://i.imgur.com/pkus1.jpg - after an initial spike it dropped drastically . 
  actually , you 're spot on ( [ credit to titykaka ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14vk4u/til_that_use_of_handguns_in_crime_rose_by_40_in/c7gtorb ) ), 
  one of those people who require all the information before making a judgement ? 
  what an asshole . 
  actually , it 's lower . 
  considering there was a consistent trend of increasing violence , that 's actually very impressive . 
  but please , do n't let the facts get in the way of your already established ideology . 
  number 3 is deliberately misleading stats with the intention of pushing an ideology ? 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14vk4u/til_that_use_of_handguns_in_crime_rose_by_40_in/c7gtorb ), 
  something can be true and still be deliberately misleading . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  your contention is that since people can get guns anyway , there 's no point banning them . 
  i 'm asking if you feel the same way about speed limits since i can just decide to speed anyway . 
  if you need me to dumb it down even more just let me know . 
  there 's a reason why official stats are taken and not just some guy on the internet guessing . 
  while your list is * fascinating * , you completely missed the point . 
  again . 
  if it deliberately misleads people then it 's deliberately misleading . 
  and yet they all survived . 
   gun restricting laws harm law abiding citizens more than anyone . 
  source ? 
   also , if a person really wants to get their hands on a gun to do harm , they will find means of doing so .
