  some people need much more help than just some money, 
  hi op , your post was temporarily removed for violating rule 1 and having your own answer in the text box . 
  if you 'd like to edit your post to remove your own answer and message me after you 've done it , i 'd be happy to reinstate your post . 
  yeah , there really are n't many people complaining about the posts either ... 
  is that richard wiseman ? 
  brilliant psychology researcher/writer who has a website full of this kind of stuff - http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/, 
  i am literally ... sick of people complaining about the end of the world posts . 
  while the huffington post is full of crap , they link to original research . 
  that being said , the title is very misleading . 
  not particularly . 
  only if it 's done in isolation . 
  gun reform does n't mean `` let 's stop selling guns tomorrow and hope the rest works itself out '', 
  who 's saying the gun is responsible in the conventional sense of the term ? 
  the gun does n't need to be sentient for it to be a bad idea that people own them . 
  an atomic bomb is n't `` responsible '' for being dropped on hiroshima but i do n't think that each household needs one . 
  in the pantheon of horrible novelties , this is right up there . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with his sentiment but since this is / r/science i thought that we should try to be accurate with our terms . 
  i 'd love to see curiosity doing duck face, 
  that 's the problem with making the argument about ideology instead of safety and well-being . 
   do n't forget , in china , a man stabbed over 20 people the same day . 
  if people want to kill , they 'll find a way to do it . 
  how many fatalities were there ? 
  also , there are decades of data showing it outperforming a placebo or no-treatment . 
  this was one finding in an entire field and it 's not being understood in the proper context . 
  apparently gun reform means `` outlaw buying guns tomorrow and then do nothing else '', 
  citation required . 
  yeah , that 's just simply not true . 
  wow , i 'm not sure whether all these downvotes are because people see other downvotes or if they are just very few people in this sub that actually study a science . 
  and that 's how you end up with a hand worth karma, 
  i agree but it 's spreading inaccurate information . 
  ca n't tell if you 're being serious or not . 
   ** people ** finding studies are often victim to confirmation bias ; ** people ** will only find articles that agree with their personal viewpoint , and in this case , it is also often evident that the associated reddit post title tries to sensationalize the findings in accordance with their personal opinion . 
  ftfy, 
  just pointing out that it 's very standard human behaviour . 
  also , there are problems with sample sizes that are too big . 
  the more people you have , the more likely you are to have a significant result . 
  that 's when power becomes important . 
  bravery level : so, 
  i like valanciunas as much as the next guy but that 's an ambitious claim . 
  the eating its own tail . 
  this comes in two forms :, 
  1 ) complaining about the same shit on reddit as everyone else - e.g. , circlejerking about what a circlejerk / r/atheism is, 
  2 ) rehashing or `` fixing '' popular posts to maintain a theme - e.g. , redditor 's wife , [ fixed ] posts etc. 
  that question is relevant because that question is relevant . 
  that question is n't relevant just * because * it 's his son . 
  lifelong nash fan and super excited to watch him play again . 
  that being said , he 's maybe the worst pg defender in the league at this stage ( after calderon ) and coming off a pretty bad leg injury . 
  i 'd be a little worried about how easily curry is going to penetrate over and over tonight . 
  none of which are point guards ... 
  i came from a jewish family so my parents informed me quite young but i had a step-brother who believed . 
  it was awesome because he was a few years older than me so it was like i had this awesome secret that he did n't know . 
  made me feel so grown up . 
  i bought myself a year of it as a birthday present to myself 8 months ago . 
  i 've been gifted 11 months of it in that time and have more than when i started ( 3 months for one comment is pretty damn gratifying ) . 
  it 's good but really not that great . 
  i bought it to support the site but there are some cool features ( like being able to see a breakdown of where you get your karma ), 
  hi op , your post was temporarily removed for violating rule 1 and having your own answer in the text box . 
  if you 'd like to edit your post to remove your own answer and message me after you 've done it , i 'd be happy to reinstate your post . 
  whenever i see something like this my first thought is always curiosity . 
  i simply ca n't think of any thought pattern that would lead to thinking that 's a good idea . 
  she said high school guys . 
  no creepy comments . 
  i believe in you reddit . 
  i ca n't imagine why you 'd need help finding women, 
  alternatively , you could just downvote and move on instead of devoting an entire novelty to it . 
  a sad nick kroll, 
  have you ever considered the possibility that people upvote them because they enjoy them ? 
  you could easily, 
  a ) filter out anything with fb in the title, 
  b ) unsubscribe from / r/funny, 
  c ) downvote and move on accepting the fact that you 're in the minority here, 
  d ) move the scroll bar the ** inch ** down the page it would take to move passed it . 
  all of which are significantly less effort than spamming threads with your stupid novelty account . 
  all the while missing the hilarious irony that you are in fact wasting as much screen space as any of these posts . 
  in summation , go away . 
  if a friend of mine did n't find that funny , we would n't have been friends this long . 
  you 're right , there are no highly skilled european big men . 
  it 's 95 % bullshit and 5 % intro psychology, 
  yeah , it 's a game meat with delicious steaks . 
  you can slow cook it , make it into sausages , cook a steak , anything . 
  if it was chewy , it was cooked badly . 
  this guy is clearly talking out of his ass . 
  oh that 's why i assumed you were talking out of your ass . 
  i work for a hotline and you did n't sound like you did because, 
   you ca n't influence them in anyway . 
  if someone is n't suicidal and you 're like kill yourself using a knife they are going to say no . 
  goes against the entire reason i 'm there . 
  i mean that i wo n't go into details about our processes . 
  not hiding anything . 
  all two of them ? 
  get a good view from up there on your high horse ? 
  but rape is funny if it 's in prison right ? 
  who stole the cookie from the cookie jar ? 
  how is it circlejerking to talk accurately about science ? 
  i 'm not trying to offend anyone here or criticise their beliefs but i 'm not going to pretend that a scientific question is controversial when it is n't . 
  oh god , i had this happen to me during a job interview . 
  i had to follow a guy to a work site ( i had no idea where it was ) and he was speeding through the cbd and cutting in between traffic . 
  i almost hit him twice . 
  nobody expects that, 
  still the right decision .
