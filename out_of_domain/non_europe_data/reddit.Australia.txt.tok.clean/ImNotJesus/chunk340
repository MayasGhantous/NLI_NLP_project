  i 'd watch the shit out of that . 
  ** yes , this actually is it - i got 3 reddit golds for it : **, 
  oh god , i wrote a massive answer for a similar question about science but it 's equally apt here . 
  ** one final note since this is getting a lot of attention again ** : this is a very brief overview of a lot of different theories and areas . 
  there is tonnes that i 've left out because i was just trying to cover the basics ( especially in different types of therapy and psychology ) . 
  these are 1/2 line versions of incredibly complex ideas that i hope you ** do more research on ** if you find them engaging or interesting . 
  ** edit that is so important i 'm putting it at the top : ** a few people have asked me how to find a psychologist . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://locator.apa.org/ ) a directory for the us and canada . 
  if you need one for somewhere else , try googling and message me if you ca n't find something . 
  ** psychology ** . 
  here are some things i wish everyone knew, 
  * there are ~ ~ two ~ ~ three types of psychology - academic , clinical and ** organisational ** . 
  academic psychology is studying the mind , it 's a science . 
  clinical psychology is the practise of treating mental illness . 
  organisational psych deals with , obviously enough , the psychology of organisations and all that entails . 
  note that studying clinical psychology and organisational psychology is a ** part of ** academic psychology . 
  to explain , therapists ( those practising clinical psychology ) are guided by academics who research clinical psychology in the same way that doctors are guided by academics who research medicine . 
  * there are three different types of people you can see - a counsellor , a psychologist and a psychiatrist . 
  counsellors and psychologists are similar . 
  they 'll both use primarily talk therapy to help work through issues . 
  neither can prescribe medication . 
  psychologists are simply better trained and have more of an academic background . 
  there are also higher standards required to practice . 
  psychiatrists are doctors . 
  they 're trained in medical school and ** will ** prescribe medication but are * often * less trained in talk therapy ( this depends on several factors ) . 
  in ** my ** opinion , a psychologist should always be the first port of call with a psychiatrist used to prescribe medication if the mental illness is preventing adequate treatment . 
  * not all therapists are focussed on your mothers . 
  there are lots of different types of therapies that have different focusses .
