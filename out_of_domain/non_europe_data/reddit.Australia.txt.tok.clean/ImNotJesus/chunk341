  if you want to know more about the different types i can explain it to you . 
  * academic psychology ** is a science ** . 
  it informs clinical psychology but is not based on case studies . 
  it is practised in the same way as any other science - double-blinding , experimental manipulations , peer-review journals etc. 
  * talk therapy is used ** because it works ** . 
  study after study has shown how incredibly effective it is in treating mental illness . 
  * everyone is biassed , uses motivated reasoning , succumbs to their emotions and totally favours their in-group . 
  * people are terrible at predicting what will make them happy/sad . 
  this area is called affective forecasting and is brilliantly explained by [ dan gilbert ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ) . 
  most notably , we ** really ** over-estimate how much difference having more money will make to our lives . 
  * becoming mentally ill ** is not a sign of weakness ** and ** nobody chooses to be depressed ** . 
  it 's no different to becoming physically ill . you can do more/less to get treatment and there are things you can do to help protect you from getting sick in the future , but getting sick does n't make you less of a person . 
  also , suffering from a mental illness does n't mean the person is violent or `` crazy '' . 
  there are plenty of people in your life that have a mental illness and you 'll never know . 
  * this one really upsets me - there 's a horrible belief started by the `` self-help '' movement that responding too much to crying babies will teach them to cry more . 
  this is horrible . 
  [ early attachment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attachment_theory ) is ** incredibly ** important and babies need to feel safe and secure . 
  they 're crying because they do n't feel safe . 
  if you do n't respond to them crying , you 're teaching them that they ca n't / wo n't get support and this has huge , lifelong effects ( see the link ) . 
  - ** i 've had a few questions about what happens with the different types of attachment so here 's a quick tl ; dr ** . 
  the biggest difference it seems to have is in coping styles . 
  the tendency is that securely attached people are the best at coping because they learn the world is a safe/manageable place . 
  insecurely attached people fall into two main categories ( some have more categories but i 'm trying to keep it simple-ish ) anxious and avoidant . 
  anxiously attached people are worried they wo n't get care so they hyperactive - get so loud that people ca n't help but hear they need help . 
  you know the type , the world is always coming crashing down and they bring everyone else into their upset . 
  the other extreme end is avoidant where people use deactivating strategies . 
  in this case , the person has n't really learned how to deal with distress so they squash it down , generally not even feeling it . 
  the problem is that this does n't resolve the problem at all . 
  ** however ** , these are not deterministic traits and you 're not destined for a life of emotional detachment if you do n't receive adequate care as a baby . 
  these are general tendencies that can be worked on and affect different people in different ways . 
  * self-help books in general are full of shit . 
  * meditation is magnificent and has been shown to drastically reduce anxious/depressive symptoms . 
  read more [ here ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu ) at ucla 's mindfulness research centre . 
  they have information on the research and some guided meditations to try . 
  a few minutes a day will actually cause physical changes in your brain . 
  - a point on meditation . 
  a lot of people stop doing it because they think they 're `` bad at it '' . 
  there 's no such thing as being `` good '' at meditation . 
  the benefit you get from it is n't keeping your focus on a certain point , the benefit you get is from realising that your brain is n't where you want it to be and calmly refocussing . 
  if you were `` good at it '' , there 'd be no point doing it . 
  * if i could give three tips to anyone to increase their own well-being they would be : regularly meditate , regular exercise , learn to express your emotions in a measured way . 
  * ** credit to allegrofroggy ** : you 're not `` so ocd '' or `` so bipolar '' in the same way that you would n't say `` omg i feel like such cancer today '' . 
  mental illnesses are pervasive and enduring , they 're not a state of mind or something that you 're kind of quirky about . 
  they affect your life in a drastic manner . 
  * `` we only use 10 % of our brain , if we could unlock the other 90 % we 'd be able to x , y or z '' . 
  this is nonsensical for several reasons . 
  ( 1 ) too many signals is a bad thing , it 's called a seizure . 
  ( 2 ) we use more than 10 % of our brain . 
  ( 3 ) most of our brain is n't there for cognition ( thinking ) , it 's there for movement , sensations etc. 
  ( 4 ) many parts of our brain are inhibitory , not just excitatory . 
  * ** credit to streethawk1 ** : there are differences in what the right and left sides of our brain do . 
  however , people are n't either a `` left-brain '' or `` right-brain '' person . 
  it 's a meaningless concept . 
  * ** credit to mtk67 ** : people do n't fit exactly into diagnoses and there are several types of `` catch-alls '' that cover mental illness that does n't fit neatly into a category - for example , [ eating disorder not otherwise specified ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eating_disorder_not_otherwise_specified ) . 
  this is n't because psychology is unscientific , this is a result of behaviour being ** very complex ** . 
  - to expand on the above point , for something to be a mental illness and not just a personality trait or quirk , it must fit a few criteria . 
  1 ) it must be enduring in that it affects you across space and time . 
  2 ) it must be maladaptive or cause maladaptive behaviours ( e.g. , mood changes , psychosis , self-harm etc. ), 
  to the point that it affects normal functioning and 3 ) it must be distressing . 
  there are situations where people have a mental illness causing those 3 factors but do not fit neatly into a diagnostic criteria . 
  their experience is n't any less real as a result and some flexibility is required to understand and treat that person . 
  * ** credit to cwagner ** : schizophrenia vs dissociative identity disorder . 
  schizophrenia does * not * mean split personality . 
  schizophrenia symptoms are split into two categories : positive and negative . 
  positive symptoms means adding something to reality ( hallucinations , delusions etc. ), 
  whereas negative symptoms are a deficit ( disordered speech , anhedonia etc. ) . 
  dissociative identity disorder is when one person has more than one identity ( termed an alter ) . 
  they ** are not ** the same illness . 
  * reinforcement/punishment : this is one i hear incorrect often . 
  ** positive reinforcement ** is when a positive stimulus follows an action , making it more likely to reoccur ( e.g. , you eat a piece of cake , you feel a nice taste in your mouth ) . 
  ** negative reinforcement ** is a negative stimulus being taken away because of an action , making it more likely to reoccur ( e.g. , you feel really full and go to the bathroom , you get rid of an uncomfortable feeling in your stomach ) . 
  ** punishment ** is when a behaviour is followed by a negative stimulus and makes the action less likely to be done again ( e.g. , you hate yourself for eating too much cake ) . 
  ** as requested ** - here 's a quick run down of 4 of the major types of therapy ( the ones i know best ) . 
  please note that most ( good ) therapists will use a * combination of tools * derived from the different therapies . 
  they 're all effective in different ways and for a few disorders , similarly effective . 
  however , some are the preferred treatment for specific mental illnesses . 
  also , if you 're a practitioner , please message me if any of my points need clarification . 
  * cognitive behavioural therapy ( cbt ) - cbt is focussed on adjusting maladaptive thought patterns . 
  the idea is essentially that maladaptive thought patterns ( ones that do n't conform to reality and cause disruptive behaviour ) exist because of a feedback loop . 
  the therapist and patient will attempt to break this loop by ** reality testing ** ideas to see if they 're true or just a product of maladaptive thought . 
  this reduces the emotion attached to them , thereby reducing maladaptive thinking the next time . 
  for example , your friend cancels lunch with you and you get upset . 
  you would write down all of the possible reasons they cancelled `` they do n't really want to be my friend any more '' , `` i 'm not interesting enough '' and try to work out whether they 're `` true '' or simply a product of distortion . 
  * psychodynamic psychotherapy - this is the modern version of freud 's psychoanalysis . 
  the focus is on creating a therapeutic alliance wherein the patient is able to explore his/her past . 
  in doing this , the unconscious reasons for behaviour can be uncovered . 
  for example , the patient may be upset due to a series of bad relationships . 
  they would try to look at what they 're lacking from their past or what needs they 're trying to fulfill that are leading to back decisions . 
  please note : although this is linked the freud , the evidence says that it ** does ** work . 
  one can practice psychodynamics without accepting the psychosocial stages of development . 
  * acceptance and commitment therapy ( act ) - act is about creating acceptance for who you are and your situation in life . 
  it focusses on retraining you to be happy with where you 're at , instead of fighting to feel a certain way or be at a certain place . 
  this is thought to lead to psychological ** flexibility ** and a better ability to be present in the moment . 
  * mindfulness based stress reduction ( mbsr ) - mbsr is essentially a therapy based on mindfulness . 
  for more information on mindfulness meditation , see above .
