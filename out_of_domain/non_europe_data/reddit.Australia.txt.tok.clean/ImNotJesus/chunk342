  ( itunesu ), 
  * ** my favourite course ** : yale have a combined philosopy/psychology course on morality . 
  i 've really enjoyed it . 
  ( their website or itunesu ), 
  * ** most informative ** : on youtube , you can find harvard 's positive psychology course . 
  it 's brilliant . 
  edit : i 'm adding them as i think of them . 
  if you have any you want me to add or just general questions about psych , mention below and i 'll edit the list . 
  edit 2 : ** if you 're at all interested in learning more about psychology ** , there are brilliant courses available for free online . 
  i 've personally taken yale , berkeley and harvard courses all from the convenience of my pocket . 
  if you have interest in a particular , i 'd be happy to give recommendations of resources or books . 
  do you know his personal mental health history ? 
  even if he had no prior history of suicidal thoughts , is it not a good reminder to be aware of one of the largest causes of death in the world ? 
  exactly , it made a noise , it 's not difficult at all . 
  also , we do n't know how many takes this took . 
  admins have been informed . 
  this sort of shit is n't okay . 
  i understand where you 're coming from but mods are already trusted to see information that we do n't allow the rest of reddit to see . 
  i guess if we were able to ban * for * a specific comment which then made it always visible to the mods , that would serve the purpose i need while not giving access to too much . 
  we would be able to do that anyway if they have n't deleted the comment ( most do n't ) . 
  do you mind me asking what help you 've received in the past ? 
  people who push unproven/untested medicines . 
  if you 're an anti-vaxer , you die slow . 
  holy shit it 's ellen page, 
  i 'm genuinely uncertain if you 're being sarcastic, 
  you 'd travel to an island to pay people for sex ? 
  there are people in your own town that will have sex with you for money . 
  great for outdoor use !, 
  monty python [ already made it ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/ ), 
  the service i work with will take any caller in crisis ( or someone needing help to talk to a friend/loved one who is suicidal ) . 
  we do n't quantify what it means to be in crisis because something that is mundane to you may be the cause of crisis for someone else . 
  `` i told you i was ill '', 
  hi op , your post was temporarily removed for violating rule 1 and having your own answer in the text box . 
  if you 'd like to edit your post to remove your own answer and message me after you 've done it , i 'd be happy to reinstate your post . 
  it 's mean tabouleh someone for a bad pun, 
  it 's because i 'm jesus is n't it . 
  racism man . 
  the little bit at the end of cbb was really nicely done . 
  i know right . 
  the way they like age appropriate music is surely cause to suggest suicide and insult homosexuals . 
  i know right , is n't it awesome how he assaulted a person he did n't know !, 
  i 'm so glad we passed the ` she deserved it ' amendment to all laws a few years ago . 
  that 's your standard for a sense of humour ? 
  wow my 4 year old nephew is the next carlin, 
  to be fair , every subreddit as well as everyone on facebook and twitter is telling a million stale jokes . 
  i do n't identify with either but i 'm guessing that the majority of both are n't into viciously beating people for having a different opinion . 
  which is still $ 8,500 less than the minimum wage in australia ( not including payroll tax etc. ), 
  your minimum wage sucks . 
  you 're thinking of games and the law is changing, 
  which has nothing to do with what i said, 
  * respectfully, 
  not trying to take away your point or be a dick , just trying to help . 
  the article is about which celebrity is n't wearing makeup right ? 
  i love how ` innocent until proven guilty ' applies to this psycopath and not to the ~ 1.1 million people employed by police departments around america , whom reddit is ready to convict based primarily on dailykos diaries . 
  well , some guy this guy knows says that he 's probably correct about his criticisms of the lapd so we should definitely not consider him responsible for killing innocent people . 
  i 've removed this post because it 's encroaching on the medical advice rule . 
  this is a question for a mental health professional and i have concerns that bad advice may leave you or her at risk . 
  as always , with any question of physical or emotional health , it 's best to consult an expert and not anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  as someone who works in crisis counselling though , i would advise talking to her about what you can do to support her - if she 's comfortable to do so - as opposed to looking for ways to ` fix ' the situation . 
  the worst thing you can do with an abuse victim is to push their boundaries . 
  also , it 's great to want to support someone you care about but as always , make sure you 're checking in with yourself to make sure you 're going okay . 
  dealing with the distress of others can be painful too . 
  an encyclopedia, 
  worth the journey , 9/10, 
  fat bastard said it best : i eat because i 'm fat , i 'm fat because i eat . 
  the spiders you have to be scared of in australia are the little ones , not the big ones . 
  like snakes though , you 're pretty safe unless you live in the bush . 
  attachment theory suggests that it would make the person worse at dealing with stress . 
  the idea is that children who feel that the world is safe , learn to deal with distress is functional/productive ways - fixing the underlying issue and seeking emotional support . 
  however , kids who receive inconsistent or insufficient care develop coping strategies that are ineffective later in life . 
  children who receive inconsistent care tend to hyperactivate later in life ( when they get upset , they become to loud/emotional that they * demand * care ) . 
  conversely those who receive insufficient care tend to deactivate later in life ( emotionally numb themselves to protect from pain ) . 
  exactly . 
  that 's the point of therapy , you learn the tools to deal with situations in a way that is more functional or remove the barriers that are stopping you from doing so ( depending on the type of therapy ) . 
  in addition , regular exercise and meditation greatly reduces the risk of mental illness . 
  i 'm not really sure how you got that from what i said . 
  the way you think is obviously a factor but i never said it was the whole story . 
  in fact , i made very clear that i was not intending to give the full story because going into physical correlates to specific mental illnesses is n't really at the heart of what op was asking . 
  lastly , there 's a very clear correlation between hyperactivating/deactivating coping styles and specific mental illnesses ( they tend to lead to different illnesses ) . 
  i , again , tried to be very clear in saying that i was n't referring to all mental illness all the time ( i assumed that it went without saying that schizophrenia is functionally a very different illness to mdd ) , but it would be silly not to discuss cognitive elements of mental illness . 
  simple . 
  self-loathing is a mechanism for self improvement . 
  if you 're satisfied with where you are/how things are , you do n't need to change or improve . 
  itt people checking posting histories, 
  breaking news , taller people weigh more . 
  we ca n't let the whores get unfair karma because it 'll collapse the karmaconomy . 
  my karma will be worth cents on the dollar !, 
  wow , that 's all kinds of stupid . 
  seriously , my 7 year old cousin understands the issue better than that, 
  on never showing emotion , the most insidious part of it is that not feeling/showing emotion is actually far less tough than the alternative - admitting that you have complex and conflicting emotions and showing your vulnerability to others . 
  there 's nothing tough about feeling nothing . 
  it 's tough if you can feel and keep being the person you want to be anyway . 
  both seem pretty inappropriate to me . 
  i really do n't want to go into your bathroom and see the sticky pages of your spank material, 
  why ? 
  yeah but do you want a 26th year guy playing those minutes ? 
  nothing has had a bigger impact on the wellbeing of mankind than vaccines . 
  one can make a strong argument that we would n't still be here without them and if we were , we 'd be a much weaker species . 
  alternative medicine . 
  fuck those , who through their own ignorance or greed , offer untested and unproven medicine to those in need .
