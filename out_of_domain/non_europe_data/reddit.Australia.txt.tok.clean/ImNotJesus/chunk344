  two guys bought a lion and after a while realised it probably was n't fair to keep it and released it into the wild . 
  years later they went in search of christian . 
  this is the tear-inducing result . 
  alternative medicine practitioners . 
  at best you 're negligently stupid about your area , at worst you 're maliciously using a position of power to con money out of people . 
  they 're directly responsible for delaying appropriate medical care , taking money from those in their time at need and sometimes actually harming people with their remedies . 
  i 've been given no good reason why it should be a legal profession . 
  so glad that is blue, 
  a few years ago , i had glandular fever ( mono ) . 
  i had terrible headaches and was constantly thirsty . 
  my girlfriend ( now fiance ) was trying to help by pumping me full of vitamin tablets and i was drinking as much water as i could because i felt so dehydrated . 
  anyway , i felt like i was drinking too much water but my pee was like fluro orange so i assumed i was still just really dehydrated and that was causing my headache . 
  i drank more and more water and my headache just kept getting worse . 
  it did n't seem right so i called ` nurse on call ' - a service in australia where you can call a nurse for some basic medical advice . 
  she informed me that if my pee was still orange i was probably dehydrated and should keep drinking . 
  cut to the next day and my head is hurting like i 've never felt before . 
  i got an emergency appointment with the doctor and told him everything that 'd been happening . 
  apparently , my liver was functioning so poorly that i could n't metabolise the vitamins and they were just being flushed out of me ( hence the orange pee ) . 
  not just that , i was overhydrated so badly that he told me if i had n't come in and continued as i was , i probably would 've died fairly soon . 
  he prescribed a bottle of gatorade and by the afternoon my headache was halved . 
  glad it helped . 
  i certainly was n't trying to suggest it was wrong in your case , just trying to point out that a lot of people waste hundreds of dollars a year on daily placebo pills that actually make them less likely to take care of their health . 
  they 're talking about developing anxiety disorders * later in life * ( at age 29 ) not people self-medicating with cannabis . 
  you read it wrong . 
   it seemed clearest that early regular cannabis use in adolescence increased risk of anxiety disorder at age 29 years , with slightly higher risks if regular use also occurred at 29 years . 
  a similar level of risk was found at 29 years for people who had not used cannabis regularly ( weekly + ) in adolescence but who used cannabis at age 29 years . 
  there also appeared to be an increased risk of anxiety disorders at age 29 among adolescent cannabis users , even if they ceased using cannabis in adulthood, 
  this paper is n't about what you think it 's about . 
  try reading it properly next time . 
  they 're not talking about using cannabis at the same time as having an anxiety disorder , they 're looking at the pattern of adolescent use and ** future ** development of a disorder . 
  i love how you read part of an abstract and think you can call a paper published in one of the most respected journals in the world ` bad science ' . 
  i think he 's being downvoted for being unscientific and missing the point , not because of people loving weed . 
  if your brother is having such bad anxiety that he needs relief , he should be under the care of a professional and not self-medicating with cannabis . 
  let 's say that i want to work out whether 5 year olds like french fries . 
  lots of people have already done studies looking at how much kids like french fries but in all sorts of different ways . 
  also , any scientific study could be wrong . 
  if some say that kids * do * like fries and others say they * do n't * , how do i know which to believe ? 
  instead of doing a new study and adding to the pile i could try and combine all of the studies that have already been done and seeing what i can find . 
  how you actually do that is fairly complicated but that 's the basic rationale . 
  the research says that it 's a natural instinct . 
  researchers use what 's called a minimal group paradigm , which is a methodology for discovering how little a difference between groups need to be for one to discriminate against the other group or for their own . 
  the difference needed is very little . 
  there were some very famous studies where they ran a children 's camp where the kids were split into groups based on drawing out of a hat ( which the kids saw ) . 
  that 's all it took for the children to show bias where they favoured their own group and discriminated against the other - often in very subtle ways . 
  you can [ read more here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimal_group_paradigm ) . 
  the reason ? 
  most suggest an evolutionary benefit . 
  it makes sense to trust your own group and having in-built biases help you do that . 
  you clearly hang out with shitty people . 
  hang out with people who are nice and share your interests . 
  do n't waste your time with people who make you feel bad . 
  also , in australia at least , it costs money to have something certified as ` organic ' . 
  being able to say that you 're organic is something that people pay money for .

  i 'm neurotic and overthink things . 
  it does affect my life negatively but i 'm working on it . 
  neuroticism , as a trait , is fairly stable over time but learning to meditate and deal with my anxiety more productively has greatly improved my life . 
  there 's a lot of research into this area . 
  one of the more developed areas is into attachment styles . 
  basically , the way you received care from your primary caregivers ( generally ) leads to a different style of relating to others/the world . 
  having difficulty connecting to people is fairly typical of someone with an avoidant attachment style :, 
  not trying to pathologise you , just thought some people may find it interesting . 
  glad to hear you 're trying therapy . 
  as an avoidant-style too , it 's done me a lot of good . 
  he means naggers, 
  i like an escalator because an escalator can never break , it can only become stairs . 
  there would never be an escalator temporarily out of order sign , only an escalator temporarily stairs . 
  sorry for the convenience . 
  - mitch hedberg, 
  there are not sexy women in your area looking for a date with you . 
  it does n't sound like she 's very okay with the way she feels about it so she probably did n't really present it in a very comfortable way . 
  fun fact : statistically , what animal are you most likely to be killed by in australia ? 
  a horse . 
  i told him he was a fucking idiot and did n't undertand what he 'd done and did n't speak of it again . 
  i 'm not a spiteful person and there was nothing else i wanted to get out of the friendship so i just ended it . 
  i had half of a semester at 2 different schools . 
  first one we spent almost entirely talking about different names for genitalia . 
  the other we only talked about stds and birth control . 
  alternative medicine . 
  i do genuinely hope it changes because it hurts people . 
  at best the practitioners are negligently ignorant of their area , at worst they 're maliciously hurting people for profit . 
  either way , i see no reason why it should be legal to sell something that has no proof it can do what it promises to do . 
  if i buy a couch , and it ca n't hold my weight , i get a refund . 
  why do n't we have the same level of protection when it comes to medicine ? 
  it 's true i 've died millions of times already because criminals know guns are very rare in australian homes, 
  edit : i bad at typing, 
  relevant [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xazbhgivabm ), 
  if lots of people do it , it must be true . 
  that 's a fact . 
  are they articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals respected by mainstream medicine ? 
  if not , i 'm not interested . 
  there 's this amazing treatment i do believe in that uses tree bark to cure headaches . 
  it 's amazing . 
  it 's called aspirin . 
  if it works , it should be appropriated by medicine and studied scientifically . 
  i 'm not saying that anything * you * have defined as herbal necessarily does n't work , i 'm saying that if it ** does ** work it should be studied scientifically and provided by medical professionals . 
  are you against having evidence based treatments ? 
  give me a title and authors , i can find it , i have access .
