  it 's really not very hard to find a paper . 
  exactly . 
  let 's test it and have it prescribed by professionals . 
  why trust people who do n't have adequate training to do it when it 's so easy to give negligent care or , at worst , scam them . 
   although herbs are often believed to be `` natural '' and therefore safe , many dangerous and lethal side effects have recently been reported , including direct toxic effects , allergic reactions , effects from contaminants , and interactions with drugs and other herbs . 
  of the ten most commonly used herbs in the united states , systematic reviews have concluded that only four are likely to be effective , and there is very limited evidence to evaluate the efficacy of the approximately 20,000 other available herbal products . 
  those two sentences are ** exactly ** why i believe what i believe . 
  let 's take the shit that works , study it and have it given by people with expertise . 
  because ( a ) they can be dangerous and ( b ) otherwise we do n't know what actually works . 
  this looks like an interesting paper , i 'll have a good read later . 
  i would 've worked much harder . 
  i got into the course i wanted to but did it purely off my intelligence and never learned to work hard . 
  once you get to university/college , being the ` smart kid ' does n't cut it anymore . 
  i did n't learn basic study skills and it 's made things much harder for me . 
  what do you study ? 
  spoiler alert :, 
   systematic reviews have found statistically significant evidence of efficacy for only four herbs : garlic , ginkgo biloba , saw palmetto , and st. john 's wort . 
  the other 6 are echinacea , ginseng , grape seed extraxt , green tea , bilberry and aloe, 
  it 's also important to note the difference between significance and effect size . 
  something can have a significant result that tells us almost nothing . 
  the effect sizes of the 4 were very small . 
  for example , ginko : `` alzheimer 's disease assessment scale cognitive subtest improved approximately 3 % '', 
  also , more recent studies show no effect of st john 's wort on depression . 
  okay , let 's assume you 're right and their meta-analysis ** deliberately ** ignored the evidence that herbal medicines are efficacious . 
  that would mean that there 's good evidence out there that they work . 
  show it to me . 
  i believe it 's spelled hwip, 
  if homeopathy ( the craziest of crazy alternative medicines ) was shown to be efficacious . 
  i would do a dance of fucking joy . 
  do you really think i want to limit the amount of medicine available to people ? 
  no , i just want ** evidence ** based care . 
  if you can provide ** evidence ** that something else works better , i 'll embrace it wholeheartedly . 
  you 're making a lot of assumptions about me . 
  honestly , i really do n't care about who says what , all i care about it what the ** evidence ** says . 
  i never said that anything he listed ** did n't ** work , i said that if it ** does ** work , i want it studied and given out by professionals . 
  what about that do you take issue with ? 
  there was a van on fire outside my house . 
  i still do n't know why . 
  it was parked on a small residential street in an upper middle class suburb and completely ablaze . 
  weird . 
  i look forward to seeing this again in another 2 months . 
  but he 's on the side i agree with , he * must * be right . 
  stop it . 
  stop it right now . 
  this is a bad idea for a novelty and you need to stop . 
  i know right . 
  what 's more , the attractive ones have higher standards for the attractiveness of their partner . 
  it 's like , do n't you hate it when smart people want to be with other smart people . 
  most likely a chromosome . 
  human intelligence is n't an end-goal of evolution . 
  it 's one of many different attributes that can improve the chance of species having genes that are passed on . 
  if you 're genuinely interested in the topic , and not just using this as an opportunity to try and push your already-held belief , i can explain it further to you . 
  i did n't see it but i 'm going to go with leaving .

  more importantly , drugs have interactions and significant side-effects . 
  they 're prescribed ** and monitored ** by doctors and pharmacists for that reason . 
  sounds like a shitty restaurant if they do n't make their own burger patties . 
  when you say restaurant , i do n't immediately think chain . 
  maybe that 's because i 'm from australia . 
  it was n't . 
  it did n't last a season . 
  take that mrs carr , i ** did ** amount to something .

  you 're right .

  i agree , but there is a big difference between reading a gladwell book or staring at the stars and understanding science .
