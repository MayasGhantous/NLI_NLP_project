  there are healthy ways and unhealthy ways to not think about your feelings . 
  some people naturally are n't very aware of their feelings . 
  most theorists think this has to do with their childhood where they learned that their feelings were scary and you do n't get emotional support when you need it ( search : avoidant attachment style ) . 
  conversely , some people feel strong feelings but develop unhealthy ways of blocking them out ; like drugs , alcohol or distraction . 
  the problem with those strategies , or not feeling your feelings , is that they do n't just naturally go away . 
  in addition , there are generally causes for those feelings and avoiding them does n't change that . 
  alternatively , as mentioned by randomexcess , there are `` good '' ways to control your thoughts and feelings . 
  of course , the control is somewhat limited , but one can train through mindfulness or cbt to change the pattern of their thoughts . 
  you see , the problem that most people have with bad feelings is that they do n't know how to escape once they start feeling bad . 
  mindfulness trains you to be aware of the negative feelings and then change your focus ( see the important step of acknowledging them first ) whereas cbt teaches you to challenge the upsetting thoughts . 
  these allow you to take control of the emotional part , while not denying the underlying issues . 
  that puts you in a position to use an effective coping style ( problem solving or support seeking ) . 
  ** everyone ** should learn mindfulness meditation . 
  it 's the single best thing you can do for your mental health . 
  you can find out a lot more on ucla 's mindfulness website - http://marc.ucla.edu/ - and also try some guided meditations . 
  edit : if you want to learn more about mindfulness , please feel free to ask . 
  that 's the idea . 
  mindfulness meditation is about training your brain to be able to focus on what you want it to focus on . 
  for example , your breath . 
  a simple breathing meditation involves sitting with your eyes closed for 5 minutes and focusing on the sensation of each breath as it goes in and out . 
  each time your focus changes , you gently and kindly bring your focus back . 
  with training , you can do the same with difficult emotions . 
  acknowledge that you 're feeling x , decide to change focus to y. 
  slowly see the feeling coming back , acknowledge it , change focus back to y. 
  that sounds like a lot of effort but it starts to come naturally . 
  also , being able to break the usual pattern of negative emotion can stop it spiraling out of control . 
  mindfulness is n't designed to shut down your feelings so that 's good !, 
  you get out what you put in , it 's that simple . 
  the more you meditate , the better it is for you . 
  the good news is that there 's [ 100s of studies ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/workfiles/pdfs/marc_mindfulness_biblio_0609.pdf ) showing that it helps you in all sorts of areas . 
  start by trying to just meditate once a day . 
  whether it 's for 2 minutes or 20 minutes , just take some time to try it . 
  the one big tip i 'll give you is expect to be shit at it . 
  that 's the point . 
  the benefit you get is n't from being `` good '' at it and being able to focus , the benefit is from training your brain to ** re ** focus when you want to . 
  the worse you are the better . 
  it 's a training . 
  you 're not supposed to be good at it . 
  if you were , you would n't be getting trained  . 
  try the [ 5 minute one ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22 ) and report back . 
  tell me what you experienced . 
  remember , be kind to yourself , this is supposed to be hard . 
  this one time , i decided i was going to leave my job and since i 'm not an asshole sociopath i gave my notice and thanked my employer for hiring me . 
  unless you 're in a nike sweatshop , no-one is forcing you to be there . 
  if you do n't like it , leave . 
  you 're still working with imperfect data . 
  there 's a gap in the market for a journal publishing replications and null results under peer-review . 
  let me know how you go . 
  sure , but it 's not just difficult , it also requires more assumptions . 
  more assumptions = less accuracy . 
  the more null results we have published , the easier meta-analyses are to conduct accurately . 
  reiki priestess maybe my favourite term ever . 
  you can still see a thread once it 's removed but you have to have a link directly to it . 
  it was removed by mods because he posted in askreddit where amas are n't allowed . 
  source : i 'm an askreddit mod . 
  if you 're on an iphone , search for `` ucla mindfulness '' in itunes . 
  then go to one of the dozens of nsfw subreddits . 
  because of the volume of questions we get , it 'd be basically impossible . 
  we 've started having megathreads for upcoming events ( like one about april fool 's day pranks ) where we get automod to filter out anything related but it 's not practical on a larger scale . 
  it 's not really that simple . 
  having more mods each mod knows less about what 's going on ( it 's not always obvious when a mod is doing a bad job ) . 
  there are also a limited number of suitable applicants and too many opinions can lead to difficulty in making changes . 
  lastly , it 's not a big enough issue , in our opinion , to warrant what would be hours of work a day . 
  even if we got new mods for that specific purpose , it would have to basically be a full-time job just watching the new queue ( we get several questions a minute in peak times ) . 
  i 'm so confused by the last reply . 
  i missed it !, 
  what 'd he say ? 
  op 's mother, 
  there 's real hypnotism and stage hypnotism . 
  real hypontism is basically like a really good form of guided meditation . 
  you can teach people to find peaceful states that they can then return to at will . 
  it can be very helpful . 
  stage hypnotism is bullshit that relies on a few social psychology tricks and mostly just people playing along . 
  no-one can actually make you think you 're a chicken . 
  evolution constantly happens . 
  each time someone does or does n't have children and their genes are/aren ' t passed on , that 's evolution occurring . 
  evolution is n't a directional thing , it is n't going to lead to a `` super race '' . 
  which part did you struggle with ? 
  i 'd be happy to explain it further . 
  almost always not true . 
  it 's called confabulation . 
  it 's actually remarkably easy to trick people into thinking they 've done things that they have n't . 
  it 's an awesome and entertaining book that will help you understand some of the quirks of probabilities and therefore why statistics are important but it 's going to help you understand a stats class . 
  i 'm literally reading this while distracting myself from my assignment on logical fallacies that is a part of my honours degree in psychology, 
  this is terrible advice . 
  please do n't listen to it . 
  there are many different types of help , only one of which is practical . 
  sometimes an empathic listening ear is the most valuable thing . 
  read it again . 
  definitely agree . 
  sorry , i get sick of redditors spouting `` correlation does n't imply causation '' when they see a finding they do n't like . 
  i like you . 
  i feel like he could clear up a lot of confusion . 
  if you just look at his last 4 , those numbers puff out to an insane 20.75 points , 17.5 rebounds , 4 assists , 2 blocks and 1.75 steals, 
  different drugs work in different ways . 
  some cause you produce more of chemicals already in your brain while others make you produce less . 
  most hallucinogens actually work by shutting down the ` reality-testing ' parts of your brain .
