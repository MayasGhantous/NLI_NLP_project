  that 's irrelevant . 
  10 % of the sample of males quit . 
  almost 20 % of the sample of females quit . 
  that 's very significant in an incredibly resistant to change group . 
  to be clear though , this is n't an exhaustive study of the causes of changing in smoking behaviour . 
  it 's just one piece of data i thought i 'd throw out there . 
  you should know before going that there 's no evidence base behind chiropractic and can sometimes cause damage . 
  further , many chiropractors use their position to push alternative medicines and anti-vax positions . 
  you may want to ask them about that in the interview if it 's something you 're uncomfortable with ( i would be ) . 
  i still think describing yourself as having `` dynamic initiative '' is the most cringey part . 
   the naturalistic fallacy is close to but not identical with the fallacious appeal to nature , the claim that what is natural is inherently good or right , and that what is unnatural is inherently bad or wrong . 
  i have two problems with that argument :, 
  1 ) why does bullshit mchippy get to decide that you should be lied to ( at your own cost ) for a mild placebo effect ? 
  2 ) it takes extensive medical training to know what the risks are . 
  it may be a situation where real medicine is required but the homeopath does n't have the ability to know that ,,

  [ psychic fair cancelled due to unforseen circumstances ] ( http://nerdnirvana.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/psychic-fair-cancelled.jpg ), 
  people still murder we should make murder legal . 
  because they 're the only body that should regulate the quality of things we put in our body . 
  i trust the government more than any individual company to make sure that medicines are efficacious and safe . 
  would you prefer pfizer were unregulated ? 
  why should some dude with no medical training be able to give you whatever he wants ? 
  i 'm fine with a patient having a right to choose treatment . 
  i 'm not okay with practitioners having the right to ( a ) have no proper medical training or ( b ) sell things that do n't work . 
  i 'm not trying to take any rights away from the consumer , i 'm trying to protect their right to have a service provide that gives them what they pay for and does n't risk their health . 
  correct . 
  giving credit is the right thing to do . 
  your argument was that there 's no point outlawing alt medicine because people will still sell it . 
  i 'm saying that you could use the same argument for murder . 
  it does n't mean that we should n't try to control it . 
  think of it like this . 
  i have a lemonade stand but but to compete with some of the other lemonade stands around me , i need $ 100 to buy an amazing new lemon squeezer . 
  i do n't have $ 50 so i have the great idea that i should get people to help me afford it . 
  so , instead of just asking for a loan , i could sell them a portion of my business . 
  i 'll sell 49 `` parts '' of my business and keep 51 parts for myself , that way i control most of it . 
  so , my business is worth about $ 100 ( i already have a table and regular customers ) and i start selling off parts , or shares , of my business . 
  i sell 49 parts and keep 51 for myself , making me $ 49 . 
  that 's close enough that i can now by the new squeezer . 
  so , a month later business is going amazingly well . 
  my business is now worth $ 250 because i 'm selling so much more lemonade . 
  now , those parts that were worth $ 1 each , are now worth $ 2.50 because they 're a % of a more valuable company . 
  in fact , word has gotten around that business is going so well that people want to buy the shares off some of my investors because they think the value will continue to grow !, 
  i do n't have anything to do with selling the shares between investors , they 're just trading their ownership in my company . 
  they ca n't just decide they want to sell it back to you . 
  sometimes companies will try and rebuy their shares but you , as an investor , ca n't force me to buy them back . 
  sure , but only to people who want to buy them . 
  you 're not selling them back to the company , you 're selling them to other investors who think you undervalue them . 
  so , in that scenario , they 're worth $ 2.50 . 
  some other person may think the value is going up and try to buy them off me so he can sell them for $ 4 . 
  alternatively , i might think that your business is overvalued at the moment and sell them before the value plummets . 
  the company has nothing to do with buying/selling between investors ( except for being able to manipulate the stock price but that 's a whole other story ) .

  the answer to bad science is better science , not no science . 
  i 'm sorry about what happened to your grandfather but that 's the reason we need ** more ** science , evidence and training , not less . 
  as i said to someone else , the answer to bad science is better science , not no science . 
  i do n't think the fda are perfect and i certainly do n't think `` big pharma '' are . 
  that does n't mean that any alternative is okay . 
   anxiety and depression assistant, 
  self-medicating with drugs is a very dangerous game . 
  sure , if you 're hungry . 
  if you want to wake up , no way .

  i had it . 
  i did n't like or respect her , i just liked that someone was attracted to me ( she wanted more and i did n't ) . 
  slept with her for a couple of months before starting a real relationship . 
  it was shit and i regret it . 
  really , have you not kept up with the last 50 years of psychology where it moved from `` i have this interesting idea '' to `` hey how about we start trying to prove stuff '',

  if placebos are to be prescribed , it should be by a doctor . 
  it could be many different things . 
  i would suggest talking to a psychologist about it as any advice given here would be medical advice and therefore inappropriate . 
  yes , there are many areas of the brain that can be damaged without causing death/unconsciousness . 
  the bizarre effects that have resulted from some such brain injuries has actually provided a huge amount of information about the brain .

  i work in a horrible call centre where a friend just got fired because her cancer was becoming inconvenient for management . 
  can a perk be the motivation to finish my postgraduate degrees and get the fuck out of there ? 
  the secret changed my life ( long but worth it ), 
  it 's actually a myth . 
   any guy from a romantic comedy that basically stalks the girl and then steals her from her current boyfriend . 
   edit : please stop telling me that women are n't property , `` stealing a girl '' is a figure of speech and it was not intended to imply ownership . 
  the point is n't that the girl is some mindless drone that has no will of her own , it 's that trying to seduce someone who 's already in a relationship is a dick move . 
  thank you . 
  luckily it 's about 300 points ahead of the 2nd place comment which is insanely long .

  that video is fake and stupid . 
  choke holds work by either limiting oxygen ( by compressing the front of the throat ) or blood ( by compressing the large arteries in the neck ) to the brain . 
  different types of chokes either affect air , blood or a combination . 
  when blood or oxygen are denied long enough , the person passes out .
