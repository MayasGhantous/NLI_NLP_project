  your shoulders moving ? 
  stomach expanding ? ) . 
  it 's incredibly hard to do , but that 's the point . 
  if you were good at it , there 'd be no benefit in doing it . 
  ** everybody ** should be meditating for at least a couple of minutes a day . 
  wait , does the kid have earrings ? 
  tiny dancer, 
  you should probably see a doctor, 
  todd glass does a bit on it too . 
  his tag is `` you 're not the one who gets to decide if you turned out okay '', 
  i 've heard a similar but bad things started happening and then he lost his car . 
  then he and his friend could n't find the presents they bought for their twin girlfriends and they had to fight a giant hot alien space lady . 
  the research is very clear . 
  hitting your kid is n't just a completely ineffective strategy ( it does n't actually lead to long-term behaviour change ) it 's also associated with a whole host of mental health issues . 
  the creepiest place on earth . 
  that reveal . 
  oh my god . 
  nope . 
  sorry to tell you like this . 
  your mother and i have been trying to work out the best way for years . 
  amazing episode . 
  i get not being into buffy . 
  it 's a little bit dated/tame now but it was groundbreaking in so many ways at the time . 
  i went through a couple of years ago and rewatched it from episode 1 and loved every moment but that 's probably because it was all so familiar to me . 
  another two standouts . 
  hush was like nothing i 'd ever seen before . 
  too slow !, 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1cii4l/what_is_the_single_greatest_episode_of_television/#c9gt99q ), 
  the whole of season 6 is legitimately harrowing . 
  i watched it over the span of less than a week ( a couple of years ago ) and it 's a ** tough ** watch at times . 
  you read a sentence that started with, 
   this is an episode where, 
  and did n't think a spoiler was coming ? 
  i edited it but wow dude . 
  this gives me [ goosebumps ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzdoqggs1im ) but i have to say that i think the next episode is better where everyone is trying to cheer up dr cox, 
  great !, 
  now i have to watch it again and stop studying . 
  damn you, 
  it also looks like it 's * very * heavy . 
  see how his second arm is helping carry the weight . 
  either that or he 's a tourist who 's worried about getting his bag stolen and read one of the many tips that says do n't keep it on your back . 
  interesting take . 
  i doubt that was the entire reason he was upset but i can certainly see what you 're saying . 
  uhh ... yeah ... that 's what i meant too, 
  your brain has this thing called a circadian rhythm . 
  what it 's designed to do is make you sleepy at night time and wakeful during the day . 
  unfortunately , your body does n't have a clock inside of it so it has to rely on cues outside of you to know when it 's night and when it 's day . 
  one of the cues your body uses is light . 
  when you see a bright light at night ( awesome sentence ) it confuses your brain and makes you more awake . 
  note : this is a big simplification but you get the idea . 
  i posted a research paper to / r/science about the link between teenage marijuana use and anxiety disorders later in life that had been published in addiction ( one of the most respected journals in the world ) . 
  the speed at which the downvotes and `` correlation does n't imply causations '' were flying at me was staggering . 
  the funniest part was how clear it was that they had n't even read beyond the abstract as the discussion section clearly explained most of the issues . 
  it 's simply true . 
  the foreskin is one of the densest areas of nerve receptors on the penis . 
  you 're not suddenly as awake as you would be in the middle of the day , your brain is just trying to react to the situation and is * more * awake . 
  jetlag is a great example of conflicting signals . 
  on the one hand , you 've been awake for a long period , on the other hand your brain can see light and it thinks it should n't be sleeping . 
  i 'm not saying that your body all of a sudden thinks it 's day time . 
  i 'm saying that one of the cues your body uses is light and this confuses your body . 
  it 's the most eli5 i can explain it , sorry . 
  yup that 's the one . 
  as an australian , i 'm sad that you beat us at something . 
  as a human being , i 'm over the moon that more people in the world have equal rights . 
  it 's a good day for humanity . 
  a lot of people are talking about messaging the admins . 
  unless they 're breaking the tos ( with something like child porn ) admins have consistently shown that they wo n't interfere with the running of subreddits ** which is a good thing ** . 
  if no higher mods remove the offending mod or someone decides to step down , just like with the creation of / r/trees the only recourse is a new subreddit . 
  however , if someone can actually prove they 're gaming votes , the admins ** are ** interested and will shadowban the user . 
  they do n't care about how subreddits are run , they care about vote gaming . 
  this case was obviously different because he 's 17 but i do wonder about adults . 
  in cases of suicide risk , we assume that if someone has a genuine desire to kill them self , they already show an inability to have sufficient judgement to make that decision and the state steps in to protect them . 
  should we consider an adult who has decided that they choose to die from an otherwise preventable death because of religious beliefs be put in that same category ? 
  i do n't know . 
  here 's been previous research to show that belief in an angry or kind god has quite a large impact on the believer . 
  for example , those who believe in an angry god are less likely to transgress moral norms than people who believe in a kind and forgiving god ( shariff and norenzayan 2011 ) . 
  i think that this finding fits pretty nicely with previous research . 
  the state does that all the time . 
  if the cops are informed you 're about to commit suicide , they * will * come into your house and stop you ( assuming it 's safe for them to do so ) . 
  mark twain - `` i do not fear death . 
  i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born , and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it . '', 
  i 'm afraid of the process of dying and i do n't want to not exist anymore but i do n't think it will be bad or painful once i 'm gone . 
  i just wo n't be . 
  i try to deal with it by creating a life that leaves a legacy since it 's the only way that i can live on beyond my death . 
  i 'll have a family that will remember me and will have changed lives through my career . 
  so , in a way , i wo n't die for long after my death . 
  as far as i know i 'm the first immortal . 
  i 'm intrigued . 
  how has your `` extensive exposure to science '' convinced you that the universe is no accident ? 
  i would argue that ( for an otherwise physically health person ) wanting to live is a basic requirement of mental health . 
  20 years ago ? 
  he 's not an admin , he does n't have the ability to shadowban . 
  he 's either bluffing , had reason to get the admins to shadowban someone or this is fake . 
  considering the comment is n't in his comment history and it would be a retarded thing for a 6 year user to say , i 'm leaning fake . 
  also , this is n't appropriate for / r/wtf, 
  writing a thesis on this at the moment . 
  most of the world is well over the mid point in subjective wellbeing . 
  3rd world countries rate significantly lower but still generally above the 50 % mark . 
  most western countries sit at around 70-80 % satisfaction .
