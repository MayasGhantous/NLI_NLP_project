  he rapped ** a lot ** that night . 
  i ca n't believe that he could n't tell by how nice the joint smelled . 
  i love the idea of a married couple not talking for ** days ** because she was upset without ever telling him why she was upset . 
  what kind of horrible marriage would that be ? 
  seriously . 
  protip if you start your post with a number and then a decimal , reddit assumes you 're making a numbered list and changes it to 1 . 
  about 15 and i think mostly for the better . 
  sure i 've used it to excess at times but if it was n't the internet it would 've been something else . 
  overall , it 's definitely changed my life for the better . 
  despite the fact that , my job would n't be possible and my thesis would take 20x longer , simply being able to interact with people from all over the world and discover knowledge at an unheard of rate is life changing for the better . 
  he 's probably not still on the flight . 
  oh god that hurt to watch . 
  it 's called the [ availability heuristic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/availability_heuristic ) . 
  while the rational part of my brain knew that to be probably true , the scared part of my brain started thinking about the part in outliers where he talks about ice on the wings and assumed that because i was on a budget airline they did n't know about stuff like that . 
  that was my panicked brain 's logic . 
  i did n't say it was sound . 
  red = admin . 
  they actually run the site . 
  mods are in green , they just run subreddits .

  admins saying it was a malicious ddos attack . 
  it 'll be interesting to find out who was behind it . 
  i 'll just leave this here, 
  which ? 
   one of the best horror movies ever made, 
  it 's not very well known . 
  if you think it 's that 's good , it 's definitely underrated . 
  the problem with nuclear is really that we should 've done it a long time ago . 
  nuclear would be an amazing solution if we 'd built hundreds of plants 30 years ago . 
  now , i 'm not sure that it 's worth the incredible amount of time and energy it takes to make a new one when newer energies probably are n't long enough away to justify it . 
  that being said , i agree wholeheartedly with what you were saying and find it so frustrating that it 's `` environmentalists '' who 've been the strongest opponents of nuclear . 
  turns out that when you have no fucking idea what you 're talking about and no basic knowledge of science , you oppose the wrong things . 
  coal kills a lot more people than nuclear ever has . 
  sorry , i 'll have to remove that for being a yes/no question . 
  something something big pharma something something . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  do you think that anyone would willingly take ineffective treatments if they were completely informed ? 
  if the answer is no , why would we let people present ineffective treatments for profit ? 
  if something works , it should be shown to work under stringent scientific conditions ** before ** being sold . 
  on placebos , yes , of course they work . 
  however , why is it okay for someone to , for profit , recklessly endanger the lives of people ( remember they do n't have the ability to know how sick someone is and could be delaying treatment for someone when it 's urgent ) by lying to them about the efficacy of a treatment ? 
  honestly , you should complain to the faculty . 
  st john 's wort has n't consistently shown to help in depression . 
  there are some meta-analyses that show an effect , others that do n't . 
  the jury is still out . 
  multi-vitamins have no health impact on otherwise healthy people . 
  in fact , due to something called the licensing effect , healthy people who take vitamins actually have worse health outcomes . 
  as for marijuana , there are probably clinical uses for it but that should be decided by a doctor and researcher , not some guy who * thinks * it 's a good idea . 
  i could give you a dozen reasons why that does n't count as ` real ' evidence . 
  it 's not about haters hating , it 's about me caring more about your customer 's wellbeing than you do . 
  if you did really care , and were n't as worried about your ` huge success ' you 'd be only selling items that had been proven to work . 
  personally , i would n't be able to sleep at night but i 'm glad that it makes you happy . 
  acupuncture consistently does n't outperform ` sham ' acupuncture in studies . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  if it works , prove it before giving it to clients . 
  it 's much harder to do proper science than to just decide something works . 
  guy running across the road as i turn the corner , the sound of a loud thud just before seeing someone rolling on the road in my rear vision . 
  scariest moment of my life , without a doubt . 
  he was fine , luckily it was just my side mirror that hit him and he barely had a bruise . 
  was pretty sure i was spending the next few years in prison . 
  do n't answer it at the table if you want to keep your friends . 
  met a girl on a dating site . 
  we were going to go on a date but she cancelled last minute and i did n't hear from her again . 
  three months later , after going through a terrible friends with benefits situation and realising that i ** definitely ** was n't ready to be in a relationship in the last three months ( i was coming off a bad break up ) i heard from the girl again out of nowhere . 
  we went on a date and 3 and a bit years later we 're now engaged . 
  if we 'd gone out the first time , we would n't have made it . 
  people kept getting me confused with someone else . 
  '' ... then we could save millions of mosquitoes from dying of aids . '',

  we also have so much content that no-one can possible read it all .

  romantic is all about effort and thoughtfulness . 
  it does n't matter what i find romantic , it 's what * he * does . 
  does he like massages ? 
  does he like picnics ? 
  does he like foot rubs ? 
  does he like having special dinner made for him ?
