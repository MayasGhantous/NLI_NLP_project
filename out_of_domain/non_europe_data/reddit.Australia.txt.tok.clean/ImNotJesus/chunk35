  do you know of a term that is the opposite of agnosticism ? 
  it is, 
  good will humping . 
  it 's a classic and the best, 
  * impressively quick fap *, 
  uncle badtouches, 
  any bottles around ? 
  also , skin a seal for warmth . 
  a quick google search seems to show that it depends what state of america you 're in, 
  makes you the dominant/in control partner, 
  have n't seen the other 2 yet but i was more impressed with x-men than i expected, 
  no , no . 
  it 's 4 exams in 3 days , even worse . 
  good luck on thursday !, 
  do n't be a fool , wrap his tool . 
  hey everyone , this guy has a small penis, 
  when i was in a remote town of australia where they were known for being pearl divers i was listening to a tour and the guide said : back in like 1920-1930ish the divers owned lots of their own pearls and would create slits , in their cock , then put the pearls inside . 
  ribbed for her pleasure, 
  i have no problems if you think it 's funny and want to use their work but at least give credit . 
  no , that 's why i made this name . 
  did n't want to take credit for his work, 
  i almost vomitted 3 separate times while reading your post, 
  oh wow there are millions of people that read reddit and there is probably some double up but thank you captain internet for alerting me that you 've seen it before . 
  please feel free to follow me to every thread and tell me what has/hasn ' t been said on the internet before . 
  i 'm leaning towards creepy but the most important thing is stage of life not chronological age . 
  thanks for clearing this up , i 'm assuming that the 113 upvotes so far are all people who assume that i actually saw a conversation between nancy astor and winston churchill . 
  either that or people thought it was funny and upvoted it anyway . 
  if only there was some way to know if people enjoyed the comment , some sort of system where people could vote on which comments they like . 
  oh well , maybe one day . 
  because vaginas are much more difficult to draw, 
  here 's you : `` i 'm going to yell in caps on the internet because i do n't like my life '', 
  that does n't sound anything like me . 
  here 's you : `` i 'm the arbiter of quality on the internet and even if something is upvoted ( meaning people like it ) i still think it should n't be there . 
  it 's so nice that i know everything and what everyone should do/think/say . '', 
  theocracy, 
  yell out to him `` derp , you forgot to flush the fucking toilet again , i do n't want to look at your filthy shit '', 
  ** then downvote it you moron ** . 
  you may not like it but others do . 
  you 're not the judge of what is or is n't funny . 
  i 've seen many , very funny posts that did n't accurately answer the question and that 's part of why it 's funny . 
  get off your high horse , no-one cares . 
  2002 alpha 156 . 
  it 's a piece of crap that 's cost me more money in repairs ( in the 2 years i 've had it ) than it cost me to buy but i love it so much . 
  as a doctor you 'd be great at it . 
  then go circlejerk in / truereddit if you do n't like the content fuck off , complaining about it in caps does nothing except make you look like a douchebag . 
  copyright . 
  i ca n't use hulu in australia . 
  judging by your 252 link karma and 2474 comment karma in over a year you 're clearly not contributing anything . 
  if you do n't like the content make better content or downvote it . 
  fuck off otherwise, 
  i do n't actually but it 's indicative of who is actually contributing to the site . 
  almost none of my karma has come from reposts and the ones that have clearly got karma because people ** wanted to read it ** . 
  i do n't really understand how you ca n't understand the concept that a user-generated site gets the material that people support . 
  you 're not special , get off your high horse . 
  this is my last post to you because you 're clearly not very bright , they 're very simple concepts . 
  glitter, 
  who the fuck did n't like walk hard ? 
  do n't you dare talk to that humourless bastard again . 
  yes , its called being a-sexual . 
  without drugs : intense shivers down my spine from blowin in the wind by bob dylan, 
  '' . . steak for flash grilling , all are used to stuff inside . . '', 
  it 's a cook book, 
  i 'm alive despite incredible odds to contrary ( any one of my hundreds of thousands of ancestors not reproducing ) and i live a happy life . 
  i 'd say that 's a pretty huge fucking success from my perspective . 
  especially when not all members of the government have the same goals . 
  you do n't think the republicans would love to be able to show that obama is hiding some big secret from the people ? 
  pay her, 
  exactly , it gives you some perspective on your favourite tv show being cancelled . 
  there are currently cars that park themselves and also ones where you can program the distance behind the car in front of you to drive but i think we would need to be very sure of the tech before they 're usable . 
  good indicators are : she initiates physical contact , she laughs a little bit too much at your crappy jokes , touches her hair/boob/lips . 
  you wo n't always get it right but it 's much better to ask and be wrong than not ask and be wrong . 
  editted because original made me look stupid . 
  you 're probably not owed retroactive pay unless someone deliberately deceived you . 
  go ask for the raise now , though . 
  oh man , i thought this said who get ** the ** shotgun . 
  i was thinking the best friend or brother is probably the best shot . 
  i do n't know officer, 
  years ago , a girl in class asked the teacher what time it was . 
  he kept talking about the lesson and just held his wrist out for her to look at . 
  she then said that she could n't read an analogue watch . 
  this was in year 10 . 
  not me . 
  from my experience , sex is far , far superior when you 're emotionally bonded to the person you 're sleeping with . 
  no wonder you 're a mutant , it 's too powerful for you to handle . 
  i thought they all died because they could n't fit on noah 's ark, 
  `` just waiting for the expedition to get back from antarctica , we ran out . '', 
  but elephants are bigger than unicorns , noah should 've left the elephants off :(, 
  one thing i always wondered . 
  did he have fish on the ark or were they just loving it . 
  i mean , all those submerged huts would 've been like the coolest fish tank ever . 
  favourite canvas is the snow ? 
  do n't trade it in , sell it privately . 
  yes , it was called major depressive disorder and years of therapy turned me into a very happy person . 
  you made a bad thread and i hope you feel bad about it, 
  nice try undercover officer, 
  it 's never a simple issue and if they both want to do that then it 's their choice . 
  personally , i 'm pro-abortion because i always worry about the child involved . 
  not to say that all women who are single parents or were n't ready to have kids are bad parents ( i know some are n't ) but i just think that if your sister was a few years older , had a job that took her away less and was in a loving relationship she would be a * better * mum . 
  if this is the case i would recommend seeing a professional therapist .
