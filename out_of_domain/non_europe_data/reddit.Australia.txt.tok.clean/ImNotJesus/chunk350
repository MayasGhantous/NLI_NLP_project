  if you bolded one word earlier you 'd understand why you 're wrong . 
  zero-tolerance refers to ** punishment ** not questions of guilt . 
  the punishment is the same for all offenders , therefore zero tolerance . 
  whether one is guilty or not ** has ** to be reliant on context . 
  both . 
  i meant the faqs in my post . 
  zero tolerance refers to punishment , context refers to guilt . 
  they are not mutually exclusive . 
  only 10 pages left in the research paper i 'm reading and then i can go to bed !, 
  one excellent example of this is ecstasy . 
  one of the problems with ecstasy use is that it leaves a depletion of serotonin the next day . 
  was it a mod of askreddit or a different subreddit ? 
  mods control only the subreddit they 're in . 
  if a mod of askreddit was posting personal information , i would ensure that he was removed and banned . 
  i ca n't do anything to someone outside of askreddit . 
  mods can only ban from their subreddit . 
  if something is particularly bad , we normally let the admins know and they 'll ban from all of reddit . 
  dae like boobies but hate talking to girls ? 
  who are you arguing against ? 
  literally no-one has said that . 
  eh , it 's too inside . 
  i do n't think anyone would care . 
  best of luck, 
  if you 've got a nice big piece of lamb , you ca n't go wrong with stewing/braising it . 
  in fact , i 've got a lamb shoulder braise going right now and it 's magnificent . 
  although , i would 've got it bone in if you 're going to slow cook it . 
  edit : i use [ this ] ( http://food.ninemsn.com.au/recipes/feedyourfamily/8357980/red-wine-braised-lamb-shoulder-with-english-spinach-and-kent-pumpkin-mash ) recipe for lamb and it 's one of the nicest things i 've ever made . 
  if you like lamb , give this a shot . 
  so something like a [ sous-vide bag ] ( http://www.sousvidesupreme.com.au/online-shop/sous-vide-bags/sous-vide-cooking-channel-bags-vbc2545 ) that 's 20 % polyamide / 80 % polyethylene is unlikely to leach anything ? 
  similar but it was sam harris that did it for me . 
  i know this sounds really sad but it was actually a book on the psychology of the characters from whedon shows . 
  it started as an interest in buffy and it ended in me changing careers to study psychology . 
  would you personally use the bags in that link at low temp over long times ? 
  only if you 're not cooking with it . 
  under high temps olive oil degrades . 
  i do n't really understand why you 'd be presenting at a conference if you do n't know what a multivariate regression analysis is but sure ... 
  ** this is a very simplified version for the sake of it being eli5 , you 'll need to tell me if you need it explained more technically . 
  ** conversely , i 've assumed very basic research methods logic but if you do n't have that , you 'll need to let me know that too . 
  a regression analysis is kind of like the reverse of a correlation . 
  in a correlation , you want to measure how much two variables relate . 
  so , there might be a 0.8 relationship between height and weight . 
  but that information , while useful , does n't make any predictions . 
  a regression analysis is where you throw some variables in and see how well each iv predicts the dv . 
  so , you want to know what predicts weight . 
  you input height , eating habits , bone density and hair colour . 
  the regression analysis would then tell you have well each variable predicts a change in the dv ( i really do n't know what level you 're at so if i need to break it down more let me know ) . 
  there are many different types of regression analysis and basically what they refer to is how each iv is treated . 
  for example , you can throw all variables in at the same time or you can put them in in ` steps ' ( guided by theory ) . 
  what type of analysis you do is dependent on what your hypotheses are . 
  study after study shows that as long as you 're above an amount of wealth that ensures your safety/security , money really does n't increase happiness much at all . 
  edit [ if anyone wants to learn more ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html ), 
  assholes were invented ? 
  alternative medicine . 
  i know that saying i would want it to be not invented is kind of weird considering it 's mostly older than real medicine but still ... fuck alternative medicine . 
  to be clear , i think that having untrained people giving unproven medicine to sick people is absurd and have never heard a good reason why it should be legal . 
  if i buy a chair , it has to fulfill the minimum expectations of a chair like holding a person 's weight . 
  if a furniture store only sold chairs that broke when people sat on them , they would n't last for very long . 
  yet , we have people in the field of medicine allowed to make whatever claim they want . 
  at best they 're negligently ignorant about their own field , at worst they 're malicious charlatans profiting from denying appropriate healthcare to sick people . 
  why are they allowed to do that ? 
  i 'm sure there are lots of things not currently used by doctors that could be helpful . 
  however , i think that if something works , it should be tested scientifically and given by professionals with adequate training in medicine . 
  it 's that simple . 
  if it works , prove it before you sell it to sick people . 
  studies say that you 're wrong . 
  it 's called affective forecasting and it 's very well established in the literature . 
  edit : to be clear , it 's very possible that you 're the exception . 
  but , statistically it 's unlikely . 
  it 's been asked dozens of times . 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=last+meal&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ), 
  agreed . 
  just pointing out that a link to one example does n't really say much . 
  someone offered me money to reddit the other day . 
  you 're right , he probably stole this completely novel idea from that 6/4 thread 2 days ago . 
  yeah , that 's why it kind of does n't make sense as an answer ( hence the second sentence ) . 
  it 's just something that currently exists that i wish did n't . 
  that guy 's terribly overused joke . 
  he wanted me to earn lots of karma on a new account with a username claiming i had a certain profession . 
  when people asked me about that profession i 'd link them to his website with an offer code . 
  i 'd get money for anyone that used it . 
  i 'm assuming he just messaged all the top people on karmawhores .

  [ christian the lion ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btuxo-c2ize ) . 
   christian was a lion originally purchased by australians john rendall and anthony `` ace '' bourke from harrods department store of london , england , in 1969 and ultimately reintroduced to the african wild by conservationist george adamson . 
  one year after adamson released christian to the wild , his former owners decided to go looking for him to see whether christian would remember them . 
  he did , and with him were two lionesses who accepted the men as well, 
  from wiki, 
  try to invent them . 
  pretty much everything i 've learned for my thesis ( subjective well-being ) so far . 
  is good to others . 
  it 's that simple .
