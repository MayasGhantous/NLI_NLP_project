  appreciation . 
  not only do i now appreciate every job i 've had in the past , i 'll also be able to appreciate my next job much , much more !, 
  plus , there 's such a high staff turnover rate that i get to constantly meet new people . 
  that 's why it 's legal when you roofie a girl . 
  if she ca n't remember it it did n't happen, 
  you do n't happen to remmeber the user name do you ? 
  thanks , banned . 
  because dna works in pairs . 
  when your parents combine to create a baby , each pair of chromosomes ( the dna you get from your parents ) has one from your dad and one from your mom for each . 
  so , for dna spot # 1 , you get 1/2 of your dad 's and 1/2 of your mom 's . 
  your sister also gets the same , 1/2 of your dad 's and 1/2 of your mom 's . 
  each time it 's like flipping a coin . 
  do you get your dad 's ` heads ' gene or your dad 's ` tails ' gene . 
  your sister does the same . 
  by chance , it 's going to match 50 % of the time . 
  does that make sense ? 
  sarcasm is when you say one thing but make it clear that you mean another . 
  it 's normally said with a certain tone to ensure the listener understands the intention . 
  irony is when something unexpected in that context happens where an original meaning is the opposite of what it should mean . 
  it 's hard to define in words so here 's an example . 
  irony is when you make a song about irony but do n't actually list anything ironic . 
  irony is n't just simply ` bad luck ' ( like rain on your wedding day ) but when something goes against its very definition . 
  yes , it 's called [ asexuality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asexuality ) . 
  you probably did n't get the scholarship because you do n't know the difference between your and you 're , not because you 're white . 
  for it to be a lie , that implies intention to deceive . 
  if there 's no intention to deceive and it 's just unclear , i would n't call that a lie . 
  i 'd make it illegal for anyone other that doctors/nurses/psychologists etc. 
  to treat patients for illnesses . 
  to be clear , i think that having untrained people giving unproven medicine to sick people is absurd and have never heard a good reason why it should be legal . 
  if i buy a chair , it has to fulfill the minimum expectations of a chair like holding a person 's weight . 
  if a furniture store only sold chairs that broke when people sat on them , they would n't last for very long . 
  yet , we have people in the field of medicine allowed to make whatever claim they want . 
  at best they 're negligently ignorant about their own field , at worst they 're malicious charlatans profiting from denying appropriate healthcare to sick people . 
  why are they allowed to do that ? 
  i 'm sure there are lots of things not currently used by doctors that could be helpful . 
  however , i think that if something works , it should be tested scientifically and given by professionals with adequate training in medicine . 
  it 's that simple . 
  if it works , prove it before you sell it to sick people . 
  i love this one . 
  do n't forget though , it 's not just the children of ignorant parents , it 's also the immuno-compromised in the community who ca n't be vaccinated . 
  you know , like those people who are being treated for cancer and do n't really need to get whooping cough because an ex-playboy model said vaccines do n't work . 
  i 'd be more than happy to offer a pay bump to compensate if that 's what it took . 
  at least then it 's all above board . 
  talk less , listen more . 
  if you do n't know what to say next , ask them a question either about what they just said or something else you know about them . 
  you can say nothing and be thought of as the best conversationalist they 've met . 
  he 's having an ** incredible ** game . 
  it 's the best he 's looked physically in a very long time . 
   rule of thumb is that you need 30 for a statistically relevant result . 
  that really depends on the type of analysis you 're doing , your expected effect size and how many variables you 'll be using . 
  that being said , clearly they hand enough participants to find a significant result . 
  i work with a suicide helpline . 
  the female operators get calls from guys who are jacking off while talking to them . 
  it 's such a common thing that dealing with it is a part of training . 
  that 's something you need to take up with the iama mods and is n't really appropriate for here . 
  it might be worth trying / r/casualiama as they have less restrictive rules . 
  we do n't do amas on askreddit . 
  askreddit is designed for everyone having the opportunity to discuss a topic , not one person being asked questions by others . 
  if you wanted the rules to change for / r/iama you would need to contact the mods of * that * subreddit . 
  however , historically they 're quite rigid with their rules and that 's why / r/casualiama was started up . 
  do you know how to message mods of a subreddit ? 
  i 've noticed a lot of recipes where before simmering you bring the pot to a boil . 
  what does that achieve ? 
  it also includes a lot of bullshit with no ability to check references . 
  remember you ca n't click the links to see if the references are legitimate . 
  sure , * most * of wikipedia is fantastic but they would have no ability to fact-check the information . 
  overall it would obviously be fantastic though . 
  `` he has taken a ripper '' . 
  a ripper is slang for a ` great one ' . 
  typing `` jennifer anniston boobs '' into hotbot and altavista, 
  as a thunder fan , i hope he does n't go to houston . 
  i think he 's a ** perfect ** fit there . 
  you 're welcome to make a competing subreddit and choose whichever rules you like . 
  [ it already exists ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/ ) and it 's ** awesome ** . 
  my terrible attempt at lip reading, 
   hey , you take that back , dog . 
  you take it back . 
  that 's right . 
  it 's called double b ** l ** ind and it refers to a type of experiment . 
  in most experiments , you have what 's called an ` experimental group ' and a ` control group ' . 
  the idea is that you do something to change the experimental group but leave the control group the same . 
  for example , if i wanted to see whether having caffeine led to worse iq scores , i 'd have one group drink something with caffeine in it ( experimental group ) while the other group had a drink without caffeine ( experimental group ) . 
  the study is ` double blinded ' if neither the participants , or the person conducting the study , knows which group people are in . 
  that way you control for any bias in your data . 
  for example , if the experimenter knows one group is having caffeine and expects them to do well , they might unconsciously help them to confirm their beliefs . 
  alternatively a participant who knows they 're getting the ` fake ' caffeine drink might think they 'll do badly and have poor confidence as a result . 
  in experiments , you want to reduce any ` confounding variables ' - things outside of what you 're testing that can affect results . 
  yes . 
  it 's based on the premise in science that one should always start from the null hypothesis . 
  the null hypothesis is the starting point and says that there is ** no ** relationship between two variables or that an intervention has ** no ** effect . 
  the onus is on the scientist to find evidence that ** rejects ** the null hypothesis . 
  if no evidence is offered , one should maintain that no effect/relationship exists . 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  which knowledge claim ? 
  cooking it in water at this point would be a bad idea . 
  if you really want to cook it in liquid , maybe use some milk or butter but anything is going to significantly dilute the flavour . 
  are you asking me how i would argue against the thing that i just disagreed with ? 
  i think it 's a demonstrably effective way to appraise knowledge . 
  i do n't think you can say it 's false . 
  i think you can say that an alternative method is * more * effective but i do n't know what that would be,
