  so what you 're saying is that with literally zero evidence you 're going to reject the findings of a peer-reviewed paper because it cited another peer-reviewed paper and you do n't intuitively find that citation accurate ? 
  i 'm sure you used no bias in coming to that decision . 
  at least poke some holes in the box so that she can breathe . 
   ( unless you knew me to be somebody who lies about things like that ), 
  exactly . 
  the evidence is that ( a ) you have n't proven yourself untrustworthy ( b ) it would be a silly thing to lie about ( c ) you appear to have the ability to discern your own temperature and ( d ) you do n't have a motivation to lie . 
  that 's called evidence . 
  the level of evidence required increases with the unlikeliness of the prorposition . 
  as the proposition is something very likely to be true very little evidence is required . 
  if you were in the desert and said it , one would need * more * evidence . 
  i do n't think you could editorialise your title more if you tried . 
  the ` row ' is irrelevant to the paper you linked . 
  it 's also not a blow for social psychology as a whole , it 's simply a counter to the recent fascination with priming effects . 
  as it stands , it 's already a contended issue so this is uncontroversial to say the least . 
  the paper itself is actually good and important , your title is not . 
  it 's like watching a whole season of mythbusters in 30 seconds . 
  itt : people not actually describing movies but giving vague references that people recognise . 
  you might get better answers for this on / r/askculinary, 
  do n't have any specific tips about the food itself but if it were me , i 'd be spending several hours practising chopping vegetables . 
  the quicker you prep , the more time you have . 
  the more accurately you prep , the nicer looking and more evenly cooked your food will be . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/vitamins-and-mortality/ ) a blog by steven novella of science-based medicine ( a doctor and researcher ) about this exact topic ( there are links to research within his posts ) . 
  in that post , and others , he generally suggests that vitamins are only appropriate for those with deficiencies and should be taken under the care of a doctor ( [ 1 ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/multivitamins-and-cancer/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/another-negative-study-of-vitamins/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/vitamin-e-and-c-do-not-prevent-cancer/ ) ) . 
  interestingly , some studies have actually found a negative effect of vitamins because of what 's called the [ licensing effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-licensing ) - [ some more info ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/26/bad-science-vitamin-pills-lead-you-to-take-risks ) . 
  i think i just developed a weird fetish, 
  when i was 13 , a `` friend '' was telling me that he wished hitler `` did an even better job '' . 
  i was jewish and have lost family members to the holocaust . 
  nope . 
  he was , by far , the most physically imposing person in our year level but i snapped when he said it . 
  i grabbed him and pushed him up against a wall . 
  i looked ( up ) into his eyes and said ( as bravely as i could ) `` if you ever say anything like that again i 'll beat the shit out of you '' and walked off . 
  he did n't mention it again . 
  pretty much any time i dance around the house when i 'm the only one home . 
  mods removed an admin comment ? 
  comments are still sorted the same way . 
  the only thing obscured are the vote totals . 
  it 's much more useful for responses to comments ( where there are only 4/5 and they could be all negative or all positive ) than responses to the original post . 
  the fascinating thing about subjective well-being research ( happiness ) is that in western countries , people 's rating of their own subjective well-being sits well above the midpoint ( normally between 70-80 % of scale maximum - depending on the type of measure used ) . 
  the evidence says that most people are in fact very happy . 
  what 's more , it 's remarkably consistent in both cross-sectional ( measuring lots of different people at specific points of time ) and longitudinal ( measuring the same people over long periods ) studies . 
  [ here ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs10902-009-9167-0 ) is an abstract for an example paper on the topic . 
  maybe a while ago but i do n't remember doing it recently . 
  if your stock is gelatinous but not * that * gelatinous , what 's missing ? 
  what would simply adding gelatin achieve ? 
  there 's a really good documentary on how hacking really works - [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxabnybvwee ), 
  i actually posted this last night as my cringiest moment but it works here too . 
  i was so in love with her and it took me years to move on . 
  it 's all good now , i 'm engaged and could n't be happier . 
  when i was 13 i went on a holiday overseas where i had no parental supervision and hung out with my 16 year old half-brother and a bunch of 16-21 year olds drinking . 
  it was amazing . 
  one night i got a ( 16 year old ) girl alone , in my room , on a single bed together . 
  i 'd never kissed a girl before and had no clue how to make a move . 
  we were basically cuddling for 2 hours while we watched table tennis on tv . 
  eventually , she said she was tired and wanted to go to bed . 
  i said i 'd walk her to her room and did . 
  we stood outside her room for about 30 seconds during a prolonged goodbye where i still did n't make a move . 
  her holiday ended the next day and i never got to kiss her . 
  the worst part is we actually kept in touch after we went back to our respective countries . 
  i fell completely in love with her and talked to her on msn messengers for hours most days . 
  i even tried to convince my parents to have another holiday that intersected with one of hers for the next few years . 
  it never happened . 
  it might be called something different there but you could get something called an [ alligator chopper ] ( http://alligators.se/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/chopper-set282x188.jpg ) . 
  no gripping required . 
  alternatively , [ this blog ] ( http://cookingwitharthur.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/cooking-with-arthritis-gadgets-good.html ) talks about a mandolin that does n't require much gripping . 
  another thing you can do is make sure that you have a towel under anything you 're using . 
  it will reduce the amount you need to grip the object ( like if you 've got a mixing bowl ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://cookingwitharthur.blogspot.com.au/p/handy-hints.html ) seems to have lots of good tips . 
  how to deal with distress/fear . 
  my mum was incredibly over-anxious and would try to ` fix ' all of my problems . 
  sometimes it 's okay for kids to go through some distress , knowing that their parents love and support them but they 're also capable of handling it themselves . 
  it 's okay to feel sad/uncomfortable/angry / frustrated sometimes . 
  it 's a normal part of life . 
  it feels harsh to complain that she loved me so much that she did n't want me to go through any pain . 
  i feel bad now . 
  that 's a brilliant thing to recognise . 
  i often think that we need to think of everything in life as micro-skills that do n't necessarily come naturally . 
  feeling love ? 
  that 's not that difficult . 
  knowing ** how ** to love someone , that 's a skill . 
  message the mods if you see spam . 
  immediately . 
  i 've banned him now but only because it sends us a message when something gets 5 reports . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive terms . 
  ( a ) theism refers to belief . 
  ( a ) gnosticism refers to knowledge . 
  the only thing more circlejerky than / r/atheism is people jerking about what a circlejerk / r/atheism is . 
  shut up . 
  do n't go there if you do n't like it , no-one is forcing you to . 
  the # is supposed to be ironic . 
  i also never click on / r/atheism but do ocassionally see it on my / all page . 
  it 's annoying but losing an inch of my screen to ** sometimes ** obnoxious posts is n't the worst thing that will ever happen to me . 
  in fact , if it 's that annoying , res can filter it out for you . 
  yup . 
  that 'd be the definition of knee-jerk, 
  itt : people criticising a 6 '11 pg who went 36-7-7 for some bizarre reason . 
  let 's be clear here . 
  thunder lost because houston were n't missing shots , they 're missing someone who was top 5-10 this year and they employed a stupid hack-asik strategy ( seriously , a 56 % shooter is a ** terrible ** decision ) . 
  this team was built to be a `` big 2 '' . 
  it 's a team of role-players and 2 incredible playmakers . 
  now it 's 1 playmaker .
