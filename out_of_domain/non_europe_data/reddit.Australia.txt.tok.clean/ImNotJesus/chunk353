  of course it 's going to be rough . 
  reports do n't get seen as quickly . 
  if it 's personal info , spam or something urgent message us . 
  if not , just report . 
  it 's was just a stupid strategy . 
  he 's simply too good a ft shooter to justify it by the numbers . 
  unless they 're drummond bad , the numbers do n't work . 
  6 '11 point guard , with almost no rest and starting with the ball at the top of the key on most possessions . 
  dude was exhausted . 
  it 's the same thing that used to happen to lebron ( remember the cramps ) . 
  no big guy can do that all game , several games in a row without it taking its toll . 
  yup . 
  when people used to complain that westbrook took too many shots , they simply did n't understand . 
  durant could be a 35ppg player , it just would n't be on a # 1 seed in the west . 
  seriously . 
  i do n't understand this at all . 
  # 1 seed in the west . 
  # 2 overall . 
  lose a top 10 player and people call for the coaches head ? 
  it 's insanity . 
  56 % on the season . 
  he was also 80 % in april ( although that is a small sample size ) . 
  i 've removed this because it 's not appropriate for askreddit . 
  you should know though that research says that hypnosis memory retrieval leads to ** very ** high rates of false memories , with some actually having false memory of sexual/physical abuse . 
  it is not a proven therapy and should n't be used for that reason . 
  good hypnosis is basically like guided meditation , it can help you relax . 
  the rest is pseudoscientific crap and should be avoided . 
  if you have concerns about upsetting memories , talk to a professional therapist . 
  that 's cool . 
  it 's a very interesting topic , i just thought you 'd want to know . 
  this is n't really an appropriate post for this sub . 
  maybe try / r/advice . 
  if you want me to apply some science i could say that income is a very poor predictor of happiness once it 's above a low threshold where security is provided . 
  after that , it takes ** a lot ** of money to provide tiny increases in happiness . 
  the fwb ? 
  nope . 
  insomniacs are regularly afraid to go to bed because they know they 'll have difficulty sleeping - a wildly unpleasant thing to experience . 
  why it 's legal to sell ` medicine ' with no qualifications or evidence that what they 're supplying actually works . 
  in my opinion , askreddit is more about getting people 's views , opinions and experiences as opposed to explaining/answering questions where one answer is correct . 
  that place is the worst . 
  if you want to know sleazy ways to pick up drunk women , it 's perfect . 
  if you want to learn to actually have a relationship and connect to women , stay away . 
  what about them ? 
  that 's fairly broad . 
  can you narrow down what you want to know at all ? 
  i actually lost weight . 
  i was very overweight and regular exercise was one of the ways i got through it . 
  you should tell people you took the pill from `` limitless '', 
  thanks !, 
  good advice . 
  not funny . 
  is there a line down ? 
  alien life almost certainly existed ( purely out of probability ) . 
  alien life almost certainly has n't visited the earth . 
  there 's a lot to know about iq tests so if i knew specifically what you were interested in that would help but i 'll give you the basics quickly . 
  please note though that what you did is n't a real iq test . 
  real iq tests take several hours to complete and are done by professional psychologists . 
  iq tests are normed so that the average score is always 100 , with a standard deviation of 15 . 
  that means that 68 % of all people will score between 85 and 115 . 
  they 're updated every decade or two to be back at 100 as scores tend to rise over time . 
  this is called the flynn effect . 
  basically , the way they work is that researchers ( based on theory ) develop questions in different domains of intelligence . 
  they then give the test to tens of thousands and use the averages to work out what an average score would be . 
  it is by no means a perfect measure of intelligence , partly because intelligence means different things to different people . 
  within iq scores , there appears to be a general intelligence that measures one 's underlying ability ( referred to as g ) and an intelligence that reflects education , parental literacy and knowledge . 
  - jimmy carr, 
  there are probably places that do professional testing in your area . 
  it can be pricey though . 
  it was removed by moderators . 
  first five minutes , going to be called ** tight ** tonight . 
  first five minutes , everything will be a foul . 
  it 's much easier to make sure calls are ` even ' if you 're calling everything than if you 're calling very little . 
  also , it 's going to work anyway . 
  all eyes are on the refs to see what happens around curry . 
  that 's what he wants . 
  it 'll be called tight and that favours the warriors . 
  it would n't . 
  alternative medicine practitioners , most notably homeopaths . 
  homeopaths offer an alternative homeopathic vaccine ( that does nothing ) and have spent considerable funds trying to push an anti-vaccine agenda . 
  not my area of expertise at all but i believe that the pain caused by capsaicin is due to inflammation of the mucous membranes ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capsaicin ) ) . 
  i would think that a sense of taste would be required for that to happen . 
  please someone correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  it 's an offensive term . 
  it 's a two-person act where a player sets a screen for the ball-handler ( pick ) to give the ballhandler space from the defender . 
  that generally causes the player setting the pick 's defender to ` help ' on the ballhandler . 
  if that happens , the man setting pick runs towards the basket as he will likely be free ( roll ) . 
  it 's hard to explain in words so here 's a good [ video ] ( http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-run-a-pick-and-roll-play-in-basketball ), 
  edit : only problem with that video is that they mention the person rolling can also flare out to take a jumpshot . 
  that 's called a pick and pop - semantic but important difference . 
  why is his hand awkwardly resting on his crotch ? 
  i have no problems with people choosing to buy it . 
  i have a problem with being allowed to sell scams . 
  fade it out . 
  fade it out . 
  fade it out . 
  agreed but it 'll still be a more fun series to watch than if denver advanced . 
   denver was n't able to because they 're not competent on offense, 
  huh ? 
  they were the [ 5th best ] ( http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats ) offensive team this season . 
  their problem was clearly on d.
