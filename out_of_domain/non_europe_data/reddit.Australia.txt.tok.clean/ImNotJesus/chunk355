  if you do n't know the answer , do n't say anything . 
  do n't just make it up . 
  here 's a blog on psychopathy by a forensic psychologist ( full of citations ), 
   the term `` psychopath '' was replaced at some point in psychiatry by `` sociopath , '' in part to try to lessen its social stigma . 
  the world health organization refers diagnostically to such individuals as suffering from dissocial personality disorder . 
  but the dsm-iv-tr , the most widely accepted and utilized psychiatric diagnostic system today , employs neither of these three terms , preferring deliberately instead to dub this troublesome syndrome antisocial personality disorder . 
  that website is wrong . 
  edit : downvote me all you like , it does n't make you less wrong . 
  my psychopathology textbook says the exact same too . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pktuzdnbqwi ) is an animated ted talk on the issue by dennis dutton that takes an evolutionary approach . 
  nothing . 
  also , it 's not appropriate for askreddit . 
  hi 61ack4eart i had to remove your post because you 're asking medical advice which is n't appropriate in askreddit . 
  if you believe yourself to be depressed , you should talk to a psychologist about it as they are the experts on depression . 
  you 're completely right . 
  i brain farted on that one . 
  i have assignment brain , my thoughts on anything but the topic are completely scattered . 
  i appreciate you pointing it out . 
  i think it 's important to be clear about what you mean here . 
  are you asking whether scientific evidence should ever be supplanted by information from religious texts , i think you 'll get a resounding no . 
  if you 're asking whether there 's a place for teaching comparative religion , i think you 're much more likely to get a yes . 
  what exactly are you asking ?

  no problems . 
  i wish i could 've left it up , it 's a fascinating topic . 
  try / r/psychology , they 're not as stringent .

  they do n't mean the same thing . 
  they mean ** similar ** things . 
  accidentally :, 
   by chance : without advance planning ; `` they met accidentally '' . 
  inadvertantly :, 
   unwittingly : without knowledge or intention ; `` he unwittingly deleted the references '', 
  one refers to planning , the other refers to intention . 
  this is the case with ** most ** synonyms . 
  that 's not a firstworldproblem . 
  that 's a legitimate problem . 
  this is n't funny in any sense of the word ( not that that seems like a requirement in / r/funny these days ), 
  hey look , that girl who does anything for internet attention is doing something else for internet attention . 
  look , is n't it funny , it 's that thing she always does . 
  reddit just eats it up every time . 
  even those horrible videos she did . 
  is it that she acknowledges reddit that makes it so exciting for you ? 
  what 's actually making you people upvote this shit ? 
  edit : stop just downvoting me , and actually explain what exactly is funny or interesting about this ? 
  what makes her compelling in any way except for the fact that she 's mildly attractive and acknowledges reddit ?

  knock it down . 
  land has value . 
  worked for australia !, 
  such a punk move . 
  one of the worst because of the context and size difference . 
  til that you need to learn some skepticism . 
  the whole website is a joke .

  seriously , it 's an anti-medicine/conspiracy website and should be taken seriously by no-one . 
  please take down this post and do n't spread more misinformation . 
  edit : looking through your posting history ( most of which are til posts from foxnews ) makes me think that asking you to take this bullshit down is n't going to work . 
  i hope at least a couple of people can see how untrustworthy this information is . 
  some therapists believe it still has some limited application , akin to that of dream analysis . 
  there is n't any particularly good evidence that * what * you dream about or find in an ink-blot relates to an underlying construct ( i.e. , you saw a bird , therefore you are x ) . 
  however , the way it is used by some therapists is as a tool to get the client talking about deeper motivations . 
  for example , you have a dream about something that particularly stood out to you and the therapist asks you to discuss what you * think * it means . 
  the relevance is n't the dream itself , it 's in the analysis by the client . 
  i would ** assume ** ( i 'm not in the forensic psychology field ) that if it 's being used with children for custody cases , it would mostly be used in that context , as a tool to create conversation . 
  a similarly used technique with children is getting them to draw pictures and explain what 's happening and why it 's important to them . 
  edit : i should add that there are still proponents of psychoanalysis who are trying to find evidence to bring it into the mainstream . 
  i just searched for ` rorschach ' + ` child ' in ebscohost and found 370 peer-reviewed results from the last 10 years ( some of which are actually in good journals ) . 
  i read your comment while clicking . 
  in short , it does n't do what freud ( and other psychoanalysts of the time ) said it did . 
  the top picture is actually a re-enactment of the birth . 
  my penis, 
  / r/awwwtf, 
  sources tell me that chris broussard is worse . 
  i wonder if people are going to respond to this comment with puns . 
  no , there 's no way , that would be too obvious . 
  as a grad-student , i think that in the few years between now and when i practice , there are going to be some pretty interesting changes in the world of mental health . 
  it seems like we 're at an in-roads similar to the one before boulder . 
  how do you think the current battle of ` how psychology should move forward ' will end ? 
  i worry about the pressure from the nimh to become * too * biological . 
  psychology grad student and trained counselor here . 
  psychoanalysis as freud conceived of it is largely pseudoscience and only important in a historical context . 
  many of the ** themes ** he discussed were right , his conceptions of them were just wrong . 
  for example , it is uncontroversial that we have subconscious desires . 
  there 's no good reason to believe that they 're entirely caused by sexual repression or parental relationship issues . 
  modern psychoanalysis is mixed . 
  there are some who cling to romanticism and do not claim empirical support . 
  others publish psychoanalytic work in good peer-reviewed journals by conforming to the general consensus that the scientist-practitioner model is the most appropriate . 
  lastly , it 's worth noting that psychodynamic psychotherapy ( which is the modern version of psychoanalysis ) is * as * effective in treating many conditions as cbt . 
  there are plenty that find the other way too . 
  especially if you 're just looking at depression . 
  either way , it 's close enough that i would n't consider stpp to be the detriment of the client .
