  so meta . 
  well , if you post in the 3 days where people look at the new fad sub you get lots of karma . 
  that 's kind of like money except it 's not worth anything . 
  it 's kind of like zimbabwean money i guess . 
  i 'm really unsure whether this is satire . 
  meh , this one is n't as funny because it does n't actually relate to the post . 
  a good tl ; dr should . 
  subjective well-being measures tend to be very stable over time when looking at groups . 
  i do n't know of any specific work that looks at pornography and group level works like the happiness index and i ca n't think of any good theoretical reason to think that access to pornography would have a meaningful impact . 
  there 's some work like [ this ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01630.x/abstract?deniedaccesscustomisedmessage=&amp;userisauthenticated=false ) that looks at social norms and pornography but i do n't think that 's what you 're asking for here . 
  did i say that other alternatives are impossible ? 
  what i care about is ** evidence ** . 
  is there good evidence that lho killed jfk ? 
  yes . 
  is there good evidence that the cia were responsible ? 
  could it have been the loch ness monster that killed him ? 
  sure . 
  is there good evidence that it was ? 
  motive is n't evidence . 
  it 's motive . 
  cia assassinating other heads of state is fundamentally different to assassinating an american head of state . 
  it is also not evidence . 
  if the shoe fits . 
  / \u0259\u02c8nal\u0259j\u0113 /, 
   a comparison between two things , typically on the basis of their structure and for the purpose of explanation or clarification . 
   a correspondence or partial similarity . 
  my point was n't that there is no doubt . 
  my point was that disbelief in truth does n't make it untrue . 
  my point stands . 
   dismisses others commentary with insults ? 
  check . 
  and, 
   teenage angst atheist detected . 
  wow . 
  itt : weird creepy comments, 
  such a wonderfully useful concept to understand . 
  that and sunk cost are the two best reasons to do an intro econ course . 
  ahh so you believe that access to pornography would increase overall happiness ? 
  since this seems like a good excuse to ignore my assignment fr a few minutes i did a bit of a search . 
  again , it seems like there really is n't that much research looking at that specific question . 
  there are some studies that have happiness as a moderator in looking at the effects of pornography and a couple of studies on individual groups ( like the religiosity link i gave above ) but very little on the direct relationship . 
  it would probably be a valuable area for future research . 
  i would n't be surprised if moderate use increased overall happiness but a complete absence or overuse decreased it - somewhat like a platykurtic bell curve ( although i 'd say the effect of overused would be far greater than under-used ) . 
  a lot of nuclear questions so far . 
  i really hope he answers it . 
  it 's such a shame that it 's an issue where the perception has been given more weight than the evidence for such a long time . 
  because their major platform is pro-environment . 
  i * want * to like them . 
  i think that being pro-environment is a great thing . 
  i just think it should be informed by science and not what feels good ( i 'm looking at you prius drivers ) . 
  hi op , your post was temporarily removed for violating rule 1 and having your own answer in the text box . 
  if you 'd like to edit your post to remove your own answer and message me after you 've done it , i 'd be happy to reinstate your post . 
  i 'll have you know that i wasted my vote on the australian secular party instead of the greens . 
  i know , it was a ( terrible attempt at a ) joke . 
  i agree that the major parties are no better but you 're kind of asking for it when you call yourself the greens . 
  to be clear though , it 's using loneliness , self-esteem , and life satisfaction as ** predictors ** of general internet addiction . 
  if anything , one would assume the causal arrow points towards loneliness , self-esteem , and life satisfaction causing internet addiction . 
  i agree . 
  i certainly do n't think that causality is shown in that paper . 
  i chose the words `` if anything '' to denote that i think it 's * more likely * to be in that direction . 
  i apologise if that was n't clear . 
  he 's starting at 7:30 silly billy, 
  i prefer the term ` slacktivism ' . 
  you 're doing a great job scott . 
  amas are very hectic . 
  i do n't really understand what happened . 
  1 ) because people pay more . 
  2 ) because using the most effective farming techniques ( pesticides etc. ), 
  means that products cost less to produce . 
  i wonder how many takes before they got it right . 
  prepare yourselves , the borat jokes are coming . 
  you could point to plenty of reasons but the biggest one is that rape is still grossly under-reported . 
  potentially punishing victims if they fail to prove rape would only serve to have even * fewer * reports . 
  i agree , that in cases where there is ** very ** clear documented evidence of a false police report , charges should be laid . 
  but , overall , criminalising false reporting of rape would only serve to protect perpetrators . 
  edit : to be clear , making a false criminal report is a crime . 
  i 'm saying why it is n't prosecuted very often . 
  [ social psychology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_psychology ) !, 
  i do n't think this can be answered in absolutes ( i.e. , you should always cry or you should always not cry ) . 
  if you take the question more broadly - `` is it better in the long run to allow yourself to be upset in difficult situations ? '', 
  - we can start to talk about the importance of emotional awareness and coping strategies but i 'm not sure if that 's what you 're looking for here . 
  so , are you asking broadly about the effect of being emotional in a coping situation or are you specifically asking about the mechanism of crying ? 
   according to the american medical association ( 1995 ) , sexual violence , and rape in particular , is considered the most under-reported violent crime . 
   the most common reasons given by victims for not reporting rapes are the belief that it is a personal or private matter , and that they fear reprisal from the assailant . 
  a 2007 government report in england says `` estimates from research suggest that between 75 and 95 percent of rape crimes are never reported to the police . 
  how the research is done is complicated and varied . 
  there is n't really just one method . 
  but , the research universally shows that there 's a big discrepancy between women who will admit they were raped and those who report it to the police . 
  i can answer the psychological side :, 
  what you 're asking is actually quite a complex question and it 's being asked at an appropriate time . 
  the newest diagnostics and statistics manual ( dsm-v ) is scheduled to come out shortly and it 's causing some huge issues and disagreements about the * nature * of mental illness . 
  for example , america 's national institute of mental health ( nimh ) has [ recently rejected the soon to be released dsm-5 ] ( http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml ) on the grounds that it 's insufficiently empirically founded . 
  they argued that without establishing a biological cause , psychology is a practising an out-dated model of symptom-based diagnosis . 
  on the other end of the spectrum , the british psychological society has r [ ecently issued a statement ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/may/12/psychiatrists-under-fire-mental-health ) arguing that mental illness is a complex mix of social and psychological circumstances , making diagnoses largely futile . 
  these questions are incredibly important to the field , partly because of what your question means . 
  in short , does a mental illness necessarily equal a specific brain abnormality or do all behaviours/thoughts/feelings exist on a continuum where mental illness is defined by maladaptive behaviour , harm and social norms ? 
  personally , i believe the latter is a better model but very brilliant people are arguing on either side of the issue at the moment .
