  4 ) negative reinforcement is n't what you think it is . 
  you 're thinking of punishment . 
  negative reinforcement is when a negative stimulus is being taken away . 
  6 ) from a scientific perspective , you * are * incorrect . 
  you 're welcome to believe whatever you like but there 's an overwhelming amount of evidence that says you 're wrong . 
  7 ) i 'm not taking the ` word ' of anyone . 
  this is a large meta-analysis , published in a respected peer-reviewed journal and in-line with the contemporary research .

  i had a job where i spent almost the entire day inputting credit card numbers ( it was legal , i swear ) . 
  i made that numpad my bitch . 
  teehee , you said cock . 
  to be fair , if you 've got a bumper that big it 's a crime * not * to use it . 
  hey , can you say that you 're going somewhere so that i can reply with nama stay ? 
  it would make my night . 
  it was when i was breaking into a field i really wanted to work in so i was pretty happy to do it at the time . 
  i would n't lie to you .

  nama is just jealous that he 's never had a [ triple gold ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/13gwee/i_m_a_nutritionist_i_often_over_hear_people_talk/c73vqgt ) . 
   say your kid is about to touch a hot stove . 
  do you swat his hand away or let him touch the stove ? 
  my parents would hit my hands if i went to touch something i should n't have . 
  that 's not corporal punishment . 
  i 'm not saying you should never physically touch your child , i would n't let my kid get hit by a car instead of grabbing him . 
  corporal punishment is using physical pain as a teaching tool . 
  ducky does n't already rule reddit ? 
  both great comments and i upvoted both ... but still no . 
  reddit 's weird formatting ruined your joke . 
  put a space before the number 28 and it 'll work . 
  while we 're linking , i want to advertise my own subreddit . 
  there 's no way i 'm reading all of that but it looks awesome . 
  there really is an easier way anyway .

  is it an american thing that smokers get extra breaks ? 
  really ? 
  i 'm in australia and i 've never worked for a company where people get extra breaks because they smoke .

  therapy . 
  i do n't think it 's just for the mentally ill . 
  in therapy you learn more about who you are , what you want and the ways you 're stopping yourself from having those things . 
  why should n't everyone want that ? 
  i 've done retention for an electricity company . 
  my job was to call people who just decided to switch companies and convince them to change their mind . 
  i really ca n't tell if you do n't know that i was being facetious or if you 're just being even more facetious than me . 
  done !, 
  i agree then . 
  i 'll leave my shame comment there . 
  luckily , 9/10 they were convinced by a door-to-door salesman who blatantly lied in one of about 7 different ways . 
  i was very good at my job because i was always able to find it . 
  once you 're on the same team as them , it 's all over . 
  that being said , trying to explain to a 90 year old that the salesman did n't include the tax is fairly soul crushing .

  definitely should n't be free-form but if you let the subreddits have presets ( like the removal reasons in modtools ) it could work nicely . 
  mostly , it would just get people to think about what they 're reporting more . 
  while this is a wonderful idea , i do n't know that i 'd feel overly comfortable giving my credit card details on a hacked website that simply * looks * like a red cross donation page . 
  i 'm not the most knowledgeable in the area so if someone can explain to me how we can know it 's safe , i 'd be happy to have my mind changed .

  how much candy can i get for 420,000 comment and 55,000 link ?

  lame novelty . 
  lame . 
  his balance through the shot was superb . 
  jumped with his weight off centre , shot at the perfect moment and landed off centre . 
  anyone who thinks that was questionable has n't been hit on the shooting elbow during a jump shot . 
  foul was there . 
  sorry , ca n't link to full article . 
  if you have any questions though , i 'd be happy to help .

  you should have only your question in the title . 
  feel free to rephrase and resubmit it . 
  thanks . 
  done, 
  thank god reddit is n't like that . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/774/ ), 
  here 's the problem with / r/science . 
  in theory , `` only published peer-reviewed '' is a wonderful rule that should protect the sub from bullshit . 
  however , ( a ) there 's plenty of peer reviewed crap out there ( b ) 99 % of subscribers ca n't get behind paywalls so they 're going off the abstract alone ( c ) people still vote with their previously held ideals ( seriously , you should 've seen what happened when i tried to post something anti-weed published in the top addiction journal in the world ) and ( d ) the reddit cycle is faster than good science comes out . 
  in case anyone is wondering , this relates to developmental work by piaget .
