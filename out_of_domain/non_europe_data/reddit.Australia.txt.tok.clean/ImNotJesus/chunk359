  you should have only your question in the title . 
  feel free to rephrase and resubmit it . 
  thanks . 
  my dad is ** very ** deep in this stuff . 
  it has basically ruined his life . 
  he 's almost entirely detached from reality and the more it hurts his relationships with his family , the deeper he goes in trying to ` fix ' his life . 
  i think the place is disgusting .

  as others have described , their language changes completely . 
  it also gives them a ` complete ' model to understand the world where if you ca n't understand the world with that model , you need to do more work at landmark . 
  the problem with landmark is n't that their ideas are terrible in nature , it 's that it 's pushed as ** the answer ** to life . 
  there 's an idea in psychology called cognitive dissonance which basically says that when you have two competing ideas , you naturally distort reality to make one fit . 
  everyone does it all the time and it 's generally harmless ( like thinking your basketball team got robbed by the refs ) . 
  the thing about cognitive dissonance though , is that the more you 've invested in one side , the more distorted your perceptions become because you 're more motivated to reduce the dissonance . 
  that 's why hazing in fraternities is so effective . 
  the more you suffer and invest , the more motivated you are to justify that suffering/investment . 
  landmark requires a ** huge ** investment of time , money and emotional energy . 
  wow , a linguist , you must speak a lot of languages . 
  i 've never had this myself but i know heaps of psychologist 's who have been sincerely asked if that means they can `` read minds '' . 
  it was also a sword when i was 5 . 
  heh , did n't realise foreskins could be that big . 
  do n't i feel like a dingus now . 
  how is that smug ? 
  people in other countries still tip . 
  it means that you 're not ** relying ** on the customer to make your rent money . 
  however , if you 're good , you earn over and above what you earn in your flat rate . 
  ( that 's my point ) . 
  america treats it 's poor like it 's necessarily ** their fault ** . 
  you can ask for specific plates in that format without paying for a custom as long as it 's not taken and it has been made . 
  my sister got me one for my birthday . 
  to think that there were people saying that the bulls should take beasley # 1 . 
  does it help if we all click that link too ? 
  this may be a silly question but how do you check if the pressure cooker is sealed ? 
  sorry , i meant how do you check meat temps when your pressure cooker is already sealed . 
  thanks, 
  i honestly believe lebron should already be in that discussion . 
  it hurt me to type , but it 's true . 
  i 'd agree with that . 
  i did n't intend to give the impression that my answer was comprehensive . 
  cooking !, 
  it 's fun , there 's always more to learn , you get to eat the results and it saves you loads of money ( unless you keep buying new gadgets like me ) . 
  hey madmanmarkau , your post has been removed from public listings because it breaks [ [ rule 3 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_3 ) . 
  please do n't post [ surveys ] ( / r/samplesize ) , [ poll-type ] ( / r/pollquestions ) , ' [ does anybody else ] ( / r/doesanybodyelse ) ' or yes/no answer questions . 
  as i posted in another thread :, 
  the friendzone ** is n't a thing ** . 
  i do n't understand why this idea has become to prevalent . 
  let 's think this through logically :, 
  you and x are friends . 
  you decide you want to be more than friends . 
  she says that she does n't . 
  ** oh my god i was friendzoned ** . 
  no , ** nothing ** changed . 
  she did n't want to fuck you , now she ** still ** does n't want to fuck you . 
  you did n't mystically transport into a new realm of unfuckable , you were already there . 
  you 're not `` like a brother '' to her because you transformed into that after being moulded by the friendzone , you 're `` like a brother '' to her because that 's how she sees you . 
  a friend she does n't want to fuck . 
  not every girl needs to want to fuck you all the time . 
  i 'm agreeing dingus . 
  when i originally received flair , i sent proof to the mods via my university email . 
  i would n't feel comfortable going into specifics as i do no want my reddit account linked to me . 
  especially given that i 'm required to not talk publicly about my involvement in some of my experience ( i work with a particular organisation that relies on anonymous volunteers ) . 
  i think it makes more sense to have flaired users peer-reviewing each other with a formal process for challenging user 's credentials . 
  / r/askscience is much bigger than us and as we grow , it 'll happen more organically as there will be more eyes on each comment . 
  i guess it 's that time of the week to repost this again . 
  seriously , it 's only 18 hours old and it 's been reposted so much that the mods flaired it as a stupid repost . 
  i ca n't even imagine will smith as neo .

   donald miller ( born august 12 , 1971 ) is a best-selling american author and public speaker based out of portland , oregon who focuses on christian spirituality as `` an explanation for beauty , meaning , and the human struggle '' . 
  wonderful quote , not sure if i 'd agree with much else he says . 
  any of his writings you 'd recommend though ? 
  which part specifically do you think is incorrect ? 
  let 's take as an example violence - if you were born 150 years ago , your chance of dying a death from violence was 400 % higher . 
  like your violence example , the rest are single examples that you 're using to tarnish the entire world . 
  i did n't say that there was nothing bad happening , i said it 's the best world that 's ever existed . 
  so many hints , had no idea until i read the comments . 
  well played . 
  awesome movie but where would the sequel go ? 
  awesome movie , absolutely no way to make a good sequel . 
  edgar wright just needs to make more things . 
  edit : including doug loves movies episodes . 
  there are other street fighter movies but i want a direct sequel to the insane jean claude van damme version . 
  the genuine concern on the kicker 's face makes it that much better . 
  way funnier than if a dick friend had kicked it . 
  am i the only one who finds it really creepy when parents/pet owners write things like that from the perspective for their child/pet ? 
  damn and i think i 'm great when i catch 1 mosquito . 
  do n't forget joe rogan . 
  he 's a whack-job but the dude is funny . 
  extremely valid point,
