  i live in australia . 
  i can either use third-party software to trick them into thinking that i 'm american , wait until it 's available in australia and pay several times what america pays or i can get it for free online . 
  if there were n't so many barriers , i 'd be more than happy to pay . 
  edit : [ here 's a discussion about it on / r/australia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1f481b/a_consumer_group_asks_netflix_why_australians/ ), 
  our cost of living is a bit higher but our dollar is almost the same . 
  from what i 've read , the thinking is that netflix will cost about $ 35 in australia .

  this has frontpage written all over it . 
  that game looks fairly epic, 
  unsurprisingly , op is referring to his [ own comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1f7tuy/everyone_kept_asking_me_if_i_was_upset_album/ca7scbm ) . 
  i do n't have any questions , i just want you to know that the naginta song is the best thing that 's ever happened . 
  basically , the stick pregnancy tests for levels of different hormones . 
  when you 're pregnant , certain hormones increase so if the stick measures enough of that hormone ( the name is escaping me ) , it says that you 're pregnant . 
  this is n't a perfect system . 
  i 'm generally okay with gore . 
  seeing the bone made me shiver . 
  there are cases of individual researchers acting fraudulently ( e.g. , wakefield , stapler etc. ), 
  but the idea of `` mainstream science '' as a whole covering something up is nonsensical . 
  i think it 's at the point now where i see more complaining about reposts than i actually see reposts . 
  that 's actually true . 
  one of chris broussard 's sources told me . 
   re \u00b7 li \u00b7 gion, 
   the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power , esp . 
  a personal god or gods . 
  huh ? 
  he 's clearly in on the joke . 
  it 's scripted . 
  just like a dane cook joke you seem to be confusing funny and nostalgic . 
  video cuts off before the best part !,

  my all-time favourite [ circlejerk post title ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/tmjb1/til_ent_sounds_way_better_than_drug_addict/ ), 
   til ent sounds way better than drug addict, 
  the context to this is important . 
  nathan fielder has a show called nathan for you where he goes to businesses and gives them terrible business advice that generally involves bizarre stunts for publicity . 
  it 's funnier than it sounds . 
  [ example clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuy_i5tco68 ), 
  i tried to put a guy 's hat in a tree . 
  there was a plastic tie around said tree that sliced up the side of my stomach . 
  i was in the middle of the cbd too so the only way to stop the bleeding was going into the nearby police station and ask if they had a first aid kit . 
  they did not believe that the huge cut up the side of my body was from a tree . 
  a laptop that does n't die in the middle of my assignment . 
  thanks .

   it seems like wade 's ** body ** just gave up as soon as bosh and lebron arrived . 
  ftfy, 
  lebron james and a lack of offensive execution in the 3rd quarter . 
  lebron was great but he was n't the sole reason they scored 13 points in the 3rd quarter . 
   kyrie and ~ ~ nerlens ~ ~ cousins, 
  ftfy, 
  talk about a money shot . 
  that really depends on what your definition of `` is '' is . 
   `` chris is a man of principle and if he feels like you 've gone against his principles , it will affect how he feels about you . 
  yeh , for some reason i do n't think he 's ever going to be best pals with sterling . 
   sterling said : `` i always want to be honest and not say anything that is not true . 
  so i 'd rather not say anything . 
  but you know , the coach did a really good job . 
  i think he did . 
  brilliant . 
  on behalf of the entire basketball watching community , let me be the first to laugh uproariously at this prospect . 
  of course . 
  i just want to be one level deeper than you so i seem like the most enlightened one and not the asshole being criticised for being unoriginal . 
  i only need like 200 more karma before my existence is justified . 
  edit : apparently people do n't think our facetious conversation is very funny . 
  bullet , dodged . 
  also , * nice * . 
  in a playoffs filled with miraculous single quarter performances ( paging steph curry ) , this is up there . 
  absolute dominance . 
  the rabbit called by auntie by the wrong name . 
  instead of her obviously female name , she was called a similar sounding male name . 
  yeah , that 's not how intelligence testing works . 
  generally just being kind to other people . 
  i want to spend my time around people who are nice and kind . 
  it 's that simple . 
  he 's like 10 . 
  i have absolutely no problem with hating on self-righteous 22 year olds but this is a small child . 
  does it really make you feel good to make fun of him ? 
  i hope no-one finds pictures of 10 year old me with my helicopter propeller hat . 
  bathroom handjobs paying well these days ? 
  having a bad day ndj ? 
  but what if he does n't use memes or pronounce them in the exact same way as the people on * this * website ? 
  what a monster . 
  it shows buddy . 
  i nuked the thread anyway . 
  wildly false . 
  google the flynn effect . 
  the price of science denial , once again , is innocent people dying . 
  on the plus side , some hipster in portland got a few hits on his blog .
