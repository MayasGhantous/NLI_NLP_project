  edit : should be noted , by the way , that this article is from 2002 . 
  or , they 've been so swayed by pseudoscience that they ** think ** it is n't good . 
  there are plenty of people not getting vaccines for terrible reasons , this is no different . 
  there are a few names but the broad banner is self-serving biases . 
  hey silent_thunder_89 , your post has been removed per [ [ rule 6 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_6 ) , seeking legal , mental health , or medical advice/consultation . 
  as a general rule , we 've decided to moderate questions and not answers ( with a few key exceptions ) . 
  except for receiving an iv which i 'm sure he was at half time and before the game . 
  my girlfriend is also always obscured in pictures . 
  but someone did one thing so this other thing is irrelevant . 
  i would consider fining players for slurs to be a sign of growing up . 
  ( cog is n't my strongest area so i 'll answer as well as i can but someone please correct anything inaccurate ), 
  in short , people are really , really bad at multi-tasking normally . 
  this is because your attention has to constantly shift from one to the other ( and that shifting drains cognitive resources ) . 
  however , if one of the acts has automaticity , like say driving , you 're * more * capable of doing it with little cognitive attention , allowing most of your attention on the other action . 
  if a white player said something and punctuated his sentence with `` no nigger '' in a context where it implied that being black was a bad thing , no-one would question the validity of a massive fine .

  which is why it 's so brilliant that the nba takes a stand . 
  when it was more culturally appropriate for people to call gay people `` faggots '' was it less wrong ? 
  yeah , being knocked unconscious and waking up a few hours later is called a coma . 
  it 's generally not great for one 's health . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  can we have some context ? 
  what a surprise that , once again , the top response to a `` what does your so ... '' thread is either `` not exist '' or something about a hand . 
  i 'm really , really surprised . 
  good luck finding someone !, 
  next few years are going to suck . 
  stick with the therapy and it 'll be worth it though .

  can you count to one ? 
  i 'm so impressed by your 90s cred . 
  really wish i could 've heard my sweetheart the drunk . 
  it feels so far from grace that i know it would 've changed a lot .

  that simple . 
  i really hope the comments in this thread become a discussion about which policies people do and do n't agree with . 
  talk about a spacedick . 
  thanks folks , i 'll be here all week . 
  which is ? 
  we 've leapfrogged each other a few times i think . 
  while almost certainly staged , this is still pretty cool . 
  any sort of sophisticated psychological/neuroscientific view of the criminal justice system will tell you that it 's based on an archaic understanding of how people work . 
  i guarantee you , norway 's system works better because it does n't teach crime as something you can punish people out of doing . 
  well , if you consider that the correlation is so high that it suggests multicollinearity , you 'd be correct in saying that ( based on the evidence ) autism and organic food are almost certainly the same thing . 
  in case you 're interested , it basically means that two of your variables are so heavily related , they 're probably measuring the same thing . 
  for example , if you tried to correlate height ( in cm ) and height ( in inches ) , you 'd find a correlation of almost 1 ( measurement error ) . 
  it would be considered multicollinear as a result and therefore likely useless . 
  edit : actually , that 's a bad example . 
  technically that would be singularity . 
  multicollinearity is a correlation of 0.90 + , singularity is a correlation of 1 . 
  [ some basic info ] ( http://dss.wikidot.com/multicollinearity-and-singularity ), 
  i think the multi refers to more than one variable . 
  would explain very little of that variance . 
  it 's a joke .

  that depends on how much you ( inevitably ) puke out . 
  yeah , i 'm not going to believe that such a prolific author does n't know the difference between `` how much '' and `` how long '' .

  it 's so that questions are upvoted ( or not ) on the merits of the question , not op 's answer . 
  it also means that op 's answer gets treated like everyone else 's . 
  the other really cool stat :, 
   wade 's run of 12 consecutive games in one year 's playoffs without scoring 20 points in any of them matched the longest drought in nba history by a player who had averaged 20-plus points during the preceding regular season . 
  the only other player who did that was walt frazier,

  to be fair , it 's immensely cringey .
