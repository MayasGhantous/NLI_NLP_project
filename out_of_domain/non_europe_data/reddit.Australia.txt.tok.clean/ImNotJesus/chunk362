  you 're the only one . 
  i 've found that engines overheat if you drive for too long so make sure you drive as quickly as possible to make sure you are n't driving for too long . 
  adding to sithishade 's answer , the other reason is that questions were being upvoted based on op 's story alone , not he quality of the question . 
  also , if you liked the question and not the story , you were forced to upvote/downvote both . 
  this way , the question and their own story , are both subject to scrutiny in an equal way to everyone else 's . 
  based on their answers to our questionnaire . 
  there was n't really anything in particular . 
  the questions were n't ones you could get right or wrong , they were designed to get a feel for what sort of moderator they would be and how they think about moderating . 
  as i said below :, 
  if i decide to go to a voodoo witch doctor instead of a real doctor for my child is that okay ? 
  we draw the line somewhere and say that `` this is the minimum level of care required '' . 
  i think vaccinations should be part of that level . 
  so you 'd be okay with me providing my child with 0 healthcare ? 
  what if they become ill and i still refuse ? 
  i do n't think vaccinating should be a choice . 
  we make rules about the minimum level of food , education , shelter and healthcare a kid requires . 
  not vaccinating your kid is n't just negligent parenting , it 's also a huge public health risk . 
  i think that that 's far more important than a parent 's freedom to give negligent care to their child . 
  if you 're never wrong , you ca n't learn . 
  i hate that people think of reddit as a cohesive whole . 
  when people say `` reddit is ... ' or `` reddit is n't ... '' what you 're saying is that the part of reddit you inhabit has certain tendencies , that 's all . 
  i 'm sure that my experiences on / r/asksocialscience are wildly different to someone who only looks at mlp subreddits or even someone who just uses defaults . 
  it 's not one thing or one type of person , it 's whatever you make it . 
  ~ ~ hugely misleading ~ ~ simply inaccurate . 
  i went ahead and read it because sugar causing hyperactivity is a myth . 
  here 's what wikipedia actually says :, 
   it was found to be impractical for space flight because of the tendency to crumble and create crumbs which can be dangerous to humans and equipment in a microgravity environment . 
  a couple of nights ago my sister was going on one of her ( usual ) speeches about how dangerous chemicals are , while taking a sip of her water . 
  yelling out `` i can see some chemicals in your glass '' was n't as funny to her as it was to me . 
  pre-emptive edit : yes , i know the glass is made out of chemicals too . 
  your case is why they should be mandatory . 
  if other people have it , you 're not at risk of getting meningitis just because you 're too immunocompromised to get the shot . 
  difficult to find 2d glasses these days . 
  i think it depends which perspective you 're taking . 
  if you 're saying that studying the bible as a piece of literature requires you to read it fully and in context , i could n't agree more . 
  what i think ( hope ) they 're arguing against is the idea of it as a ` perfect ' guide to life as it 's portrayed by * some * christians . 
  it 's a burden of proof thing . 
  if you 're arguing against `` the bible is written by god , god is all-knowing/all-powerful , therefore the bible must be perfect to be true '' then very little evidence is required ( not saying it 's a valid position ) . 
  if you 're arguing that as a piece of literature it 's deeply flawed , the burden of proof is on you . 
  you do realise that giving an np link means they wo n't be able to vote right ? 
  what a weird thing to lie about that would be . 
  or healthy, 
  1 ) admins and mods are different, 
  2 ) admins do n't care what rules moderators put in place , they care if people are obstructing the running of the site by spamming moderators . 
  you 're like the definition of pertussis . 
  this is so clearly a joke . 
  notice how similar similar the vertex angle symbol is to the eye of providence ? 
  this goes deep, 
  do n't even get me started on half-life 3, 
  in / r/askreddit we 've become ** much ** stricter with how we moderate in the last year and each time it has been met with resistance . 
  however , almost unanimously people think the sub is better than it used to be . 
  for a guide to all of the best complaining : http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fs0nd/a_guide_to_the_best_complaining_about_the_rule/, 
  he was removed for being inactive for 9 months . 
  it was n't about content . 
  as for that quote , i do n't know whether you 're being deliberately obstinate or if you genuinely do n't understand what i 'm saying . 
  finding a new sub was a suggestion for people who are dissatisfied with / r/atheism . 
  when i said, 
   i 'm not saying what anyone should/shouldn ' t have done . 
  it was directly in response to you asking why the admins did n't apply that to the mods . 
  clearly that sentence was me saying that i 'm not speaking for the mods or admins . 
  i 'm just trying to educate newer redditors on how reddit works . 
  done, 
  it may be apocryphal but i remember hearing the story of a scam in australia a while ago . 
  someone took a full-page ad in the newspaper with a completely guaranteed method to cut your bills in half . 
  he received a huge amount of money and sent a pair of scissors to each person who sent him money . 
  just a reminder everyone , even if you 're claiming that they 're a ` scammer ' , you 're not allowed to post ** any ** personal information . 
  if you post a link/photo that includes an email address , phone number or full name , i 'll be forced to ban you . 
  i 've already had to ban one person , please do n't make me ban anyone else . 
  it means that voting wo n't count on any page accessed with it as a prefix . 
  it 's used by meta-subreddits to stop their users influencing the sub too much . 
  subs that just talk about other subreddits, 
  i 'd be happy to add it if you provide a link, 
  i made a quick guide - [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fs0nd/a_guide_to_the_best_complaining_about_the_rule/ ) . 
  skeen is n't getting his power back so it 's moot . 
  the admins are n't going to reinstate him . 
  i 'll get right on that . 
  they did n't ` conspire ' against him . 
  reddit rules are that if you 're inactive as a mod for over 2 months , the admins can remove you . 
  he ** abandoned ** the subreddit . 
  enforcing the rules is a small % of modding is what i 'm saying though . 
  very consistently the more we 've moderated in askreddit the better the feedback has been . 
  i think most redditors * think * they want no moderation but they do n't really . 
  i did n't mean it as a criticism . 
  you 've got to remember that people go to the defaults when they 're brand new to reddit . 
  by the time someone has found your smaller sub , they 've already got reddit experience . 
  the face that you think you can just sit and let a default take care of itself tells me everything i need to know about your ability to mod one . 
  that 's a great example . 
  a police force could decide to have relaxed rules but that does n't mean that they can simply stop acting entirely . 
  even if your rules are lax , they 're still needed . 
  the thing to remember , firstly , is that every single new person uses the defaults almost exclusively . 
  that means you 're going to get a much larger proportion of people who do n't know what they 're doing . 
  additionally , if you 're spam advertising or generally trying to be a nuisance , you want the subreddits with the largest number of users . 
  so , you have to deal with a lot more shit than everyone else being a default . 
  as i said above : active mods stop abuse , stop site-breaking rules , stop child porn being posted , stop vote brigades , take posts out of the spam filter and help new users . 
  this users deserve moderators who turn up and actually contribute or step aside and let others . 
  active mods are important . 
  that 's ** most ** important in the defaults . 
  are you going to be hands off with child porn ? 
  personal info ? 
  vote brigading ?
