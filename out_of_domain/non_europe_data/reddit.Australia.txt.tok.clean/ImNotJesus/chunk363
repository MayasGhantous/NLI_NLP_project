  getting stuff out of the spam filter ? 
  show spoilers ? 
  general shitty behaviour ? 
  in a default , even if you want lax rules you * need * a lot of moderation . 
  doing nothing as the top mod on a default is doing ** a lot ** wrong . 
  you might not be [ far off ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cadatq4 ) . 
  i 'm trying to explain that active moderation in a default is n't about enforcing or not enforcing the rules . 
  heartwarming and all but why was a relevant that she was aboriginal ? 
  i 'm totally on board with all 5 , especially # 3 . 
  this is so true . 
  the best sex is when they 're only doing it because they fee like they have to . 
  hey , elixer22 , your post has been removed because it violates [ [ rule 1 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1 ) . 
  your answer goes in the comments , not the text box . 
  reply to this message when you 've edited it and we 'll put it back up . 
  thanks, 
  prevention . 
  before you go out drinking , leave something with electrolytes next to your bed and have a big drink before you go to sleep . 
  it 'll have a far bigger impact than anything you do once it has set in . 
  ^ spot on, 
  wonderful idea , not how reality works . 
  emotions matter . 
  i have n't heard a good karmanaut conspiracy theory in a while . 
  can we start that ? 
  yeah ... well ... 
  i 'm so embarrassed for your face right now . 
  thank god . 
  socrates did n't die on the cross for our memes to be censored . 
  but how can they be expected to click twice to see a facebook screenshot ? 
  this whole thing has confirmed everything that the rest of reddit feels about / r/atheism . 
  that post was from over a year ago and the comments are now heavily moderated because it did n't work . 
   if it were n't for karma , there would literally be no posts on reddit . 
  some of the biggest subreddits on reddit are self-post only . 
  you are objectively wrong . 
  the joy that it gives me that you spent 20 minutes crafting that for it to be downvoted below the threshold in minutes is indescribable . 
  people who care about gaming as a whole are a very , very small percentage of people who buy consoles . 
  the average gamer does n't care . 
  it 's that simple . 
  i did n't call anyone dumb . 
  not even a remotely close analogy . 
  if you get a job and do n't turn up for 3 months . 
  you ca n't complain when you get fired . 
  this is the admin 's website , his job was the run the subreddit . 
  he did n't , he got fired . 
  plain and simple . 
  their competence in any task . 
  not even remotely close to theft .

  plain and simple . 
  a simple upvote would have sufficed . 
  gone in 3 ... 2 . . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g3x3y/meta_request_for_clarification_of_the_new_new/caghufd ), 
  panic attacks are normally dealt with by either doing breathing exercises or body tensing exercises . 
  the thing about panic attacks is that they 're a cycle . 
  once the panic sets in , you have body sensations that tell your brain that you 're panicking , this causes your brain to panic more which causes more body sensations etc. 
  the trick is to break the cycle . 
  for example , basic meditation exercises like focusing on the sensation of your own breath , * can * short circuit that process and return you to the present . 
  if you 're personally having regular panic attacks , it 's always something you could talk to a therapist about . 
  there are desensitisation programs you can do if they 're caused by specific fears like elevators .

  i 'm not sure i understand your question . 
  are you asking why non-sexual desires become proxies for sexual desires or why people desire ** anything ** that is n't sex ? 
  you 've got to watch out for that metronomearthritis . 
  it 's most common in the old-timers though . 
  til that news = uncited table with a vague message at the bottom . 
  cool . 
  you 're not being a dick , he was . 
  great example of thinking you 're more important than a class that costs thousands of dollars to be in . 
  he did n't cover the corner three . 
  he stood in a position that did n't help in either case . 
  he literally swayed on the spot in a way that would make it harder for him to explode in either direction too . 
  it was a ` general ' subreddit that was run by the admins . 
  man, 
  here 's an analogy :, 
  imagine that you 're trying to measure how long your table is . 
  you look around and see a ruler and a stick . 
  you realise that with either , you can keep measuring the item end of end until you get to the end and this will give you a measurement . 
  you use the stick and realise that your desk is 3 and a half sticks long . 
  you now know more about your desk . 
  you now use the ruler . 
  you realise that it 's 2 and a half rulers long with each ruler being 30 centimetres . 
  because the ruler is a ** known entity ** , that is , you already know more about what its properties are , using the ruler instead gives you more total information . 
  with the stick , you know that it 's 3.5 sticks long . 
  with the ruler , you know that it 's 2.5 rulers long ** and ** that it 's 75 centimetres . 
  literally nothing . 
  it 's theirs to destroy . 
  mods own the subs , not the users . 
  fucking an ugly girl is like riding a scooter . 
  it 's fun unless your friends find out . 
   yeah , the long and short of it is that intelligence has n't greatly changed . 
  i do n't think that 's the most accurate way to say it . 
  i think that we can say confidently from flynn effect work that there are n't meaningful differences between races and that genetic contribution of iq has n't changed meaningfully . 
  however , intelligence is still partly a function of environment and that * has * objectively improved . 
  not trying to nitpick but i think it 's an important distinction . 
  it 's not a permanent fix but it has reduced the mass downvoting . 
  admins have made it clear that they do n't interfere with how subreddits are run unless things are outside of their policies . 
  as i 've already explained to you here and in / r/atheismpolicy . 
  this is a matter of necessity for running the sub .
