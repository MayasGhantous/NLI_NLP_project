  you 're not allowed to make unfettered meta posts in almost any default . 
  meta-posts on / r/atheism started being removed because they were dominating the subreddit . 
  we 've asked them to all be posted on / r/atheismpolicy where other interested users and the mods can discuss them . 
  i 'm guessing that your post was a meta-post . 
  it 's also possible that automod removed it in error . 
  i ca n't know without a link . 
  that 's hard to quantify as an answer . 
  in short , we 'll try to take our cues from the users as well as trying to incorporate any good ideas . 
  for example , if someone has a brilliant idea we all agree with , it 's likely to be implemented . 
  if it 's something like this where we get a consistent response that we were n't clear enough with a rule , we 'll try to go back and fix the rule . 
  of course , we ca n't use every idea so we have to judge them on their merit and how common they are . 
  please show me where i have n't been civil . 
  it is but i 'm trying my best to at least read everything , even if i ca n't possibly respond to it all . 
  nice one, 
  you 're welcome to believe what you believe but if you look at my history you 'll find that i 've done nothing but try to engage the community and listen to feedback . 
  i understand that you feel that that 's what we 've been doing . 
  unfortunately , no words can tell you to trust my words right now . 
  however , i do believe that in time you 'll see that we 've only had the best intentions since the start . 
  i ca n't comment on what other mods have/haven ' t said in the past . 
  all i can comment on is my position and my intention . 
  i understand that you 're angry and , as shown above , we 're sorry for how that his turned out . 
  i hope that in time you 'll be able to see the situation from our perspective . 
  we 're not trying to censor anything . 
  we removed those posts and set up / r/atheismpolicy so that people could still have a voice without it completely holding up the subreddit . 
  we absolutely read and respond to feedback there . 
  edit : i understand that you 're angry but downovting me does n't do anything to hurt me . 
  it just means that less people see the information . 
  right now , it 's impossible to assess how effective they are because of the downvote brigades . 
  we are committed to improving the quality of the subreddit . 
  if these rules do n't , we are not opposed to changing them, 
  we 're not banning protest . 
  we 're trying to make it so that protest does n't ruin content for other users . 
  yes . 
  the circumstance is that in a situation where it 's possible to assess the efficaciousness of the changes if they appear to be not working , we will change them . 
   even your claim of `` a small amount of moderation '' is somewhat contrary to the somewhat significant policy changes recently posted . 
  i think you 'll find that 5 rules is still the smallest of any default by a significant amount . 
  two of them are essentially reddiquette anyway . 
   these new changes , however , are active moderation with the intention of shaping the content . 
  we 're not trying to shape content . 
  images have an unfair advantage in a user-generated site and we 're trying to level the playing field . 
   i came here specifically because there was no prior attempt to do this , to make the conversations erudite or civilized . 
  thank you for that . 
  we * have * received some eloquent and well thought out modmail from both sides of the argument . 
  a well written response is far more effective than the majority of what i 've heard which is basically `` kill yourself '', 
  edit : i understand that many of you are angry towards me but downvoting me does nothing to punish me except hiding the information from others . 
  instead , give me your opinion . 
  i 'm trying to respond to everything but i 'm at least reading it all . 
  the first rule is n't stringent . 
  we 're just trying to keep things ** vaguely ** on topic . 
  you 're not going to have a post about lgbt rights removed . 
  well , despite your anger i would hope that you do n't think that throwing slurs at anyone as a way of expressing your point is the right way to go about things . 
  whether or not you agree with my position here , i do believe i have a right to not be called a `` fucking cunt faggot '' all day . 
  what can you do . 
  thanks for trying . 
  if you could find that for me , i 'd be happy to fellate you . 
  ca n't it be both ? 
  angry people say angry things . 
  water off a duck 's back . 
  careful idsab . 
  the [ cia are on the case ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1gbm9s/this_is_what_happened/cain3jb ), 
  to be fair , if you were n't involved you at least knew it was going to happen . 
  he 's got you there . 
  thanks, 
  birth unfortunately, 
  hey trippy3847 , your post has been removed from public listings because it breaks [ [ rule 3 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_3 ) . 
  please do n't post [ surveys ] ( / r/samplesize ) , [ poll-type ] ( / r/pollquestions ) , ' [ does anybody else ] ( / r/doesanybodyelse ) ' or yes/no answer questions . 
  oh god the snot bubbles . 
  anything but green snot bubbles . 
  it 'd be a remake of life of brian i guess . 
  i bought it to support the website that i use all day every day . 
  i almost took a job at a glorified pyramid scheme . 
  it was a `` sports marketing '' job . 
  i went to a very fancy office filled with lots of men in suits with a brilliant sales pitch . 
  the idea was that you start by showing them your selling skills and selling raffle tickets outside of sporting events . 
  then , when you 've done that for a while , you have people underneath you that sell tickets and you get a cut . 
  each time they get someone below them , you get a cut of that . 
  i was like 16 and thought it was the coolest thing ever . 
  also an australian . 
  literally only ever heard of fiver on that list . 
  i 've heard a bogan call it a hundo once but i guess i 'm out of touch with the slang . 
  as an australian ** smashed *, 
  8 out of 10 cats, 
  there 's a prevailing understanding that the same people who are arguing over and over in atheismpolicy and feedback posts are not the active users of the subreddit . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/agentlame/comments/1gop56/script_ghost_town/ ) . 
  he 's been banned for site-rule breaking before . 
  he did it in the mod channel , not sure if he did it in #atheism too . 
  if you look at the most popular posts from a month ago , their names do not appear . 
  1 ) that 's not how any default subreddit works, 
  2 ) we should be able to discuss unformed ideas and voice our opinions on mod policy freely until we 're ready to announce, 
  i 'm not going to show you screenshots of the askreddit mods page . 
  that 's because of the subreddit 's special need for ` secrecy ' it 's because that 's how moderating works . 
  there 's no secrecy about final decisions . 
  the rules are in the sidebar . 
  rules are n't being reverted . 
  we 've discussed it several times internally and it is n't happening in the short-term . 
  there are discussions about possible compromise solutions but nothing is close to finalised . 
  you should dump your lying girlfriend then . 
  or just make up another one . 
  oh shit , i did too . 
  he talked a lot of shit in a small amount of time .
