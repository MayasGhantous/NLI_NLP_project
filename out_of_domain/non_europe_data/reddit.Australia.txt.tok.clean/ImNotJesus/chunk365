  oh i 'm sure there 'll be plenty more to come . 
  inb4 this thread gets covered with copypasta, 
  speaking of thinking before you open your mouth ... 
  this looks at data from the feedback thread , well before users started being banned for abuse/harrassment/doxing / threats etc. 
  what was the / r/reportthespammers post ? 
  nope , was n't me,

  `` love you '', 
  from my mum, 
  hmm, 
  oh thank ( facebook ) god . 
  he 's be probably the worst of anyone, 
  it 's nothing that exciting , do n't get too worked up . 
  there 's a reason i ca n't currently say it ( may not even be able to in the future ) . 
  trust that if there were any chance i could give you butteriness i would, 
  for someone that hates the subreddit so much , you spend an awful lot of time in the new queue . 
  i wonder what you do there ... 
  ## this submission has been removed due to the subreddit 's submission guidelines, 
  policy discussion and discussion regarding / r/atheism itself is welcome at any time on the [ #atheism channel on irc ] ( https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#atheism ) . 
  someone should make a script to do that for you . 
  scans for number of comments in a chosen subreddit and if they 're over x number it tags them . 
  i 'd pay upvotes for that . 
  so which private subreddit led you to this thread ? 
  what motivation do i have to lie ? 
  i 'd be ** more ** popular on / r/subredditdrama if i was banning indiscriminantly . 
   listen guy , its your job to sit there and take abuse . 
  false . 
  yup . 
  it 's all a vast conspiracy to take your memes which would make me infinite profit somehow . 
  well , they do . 
  people that are n't able to use their voice maturely or constructively , tend to have that voice ignored . 
  literally nothing to do with what i said . 
  it 's a theory, 
  it was . 
  poe 's law etc, 
  i like memecaust . 
  which would make manwithoutmodem hitler . 
  yeathl is n't . 
  he 's the same in pm . 
  [ he 's also the one that has been working the hardest on the downvoting brigade issue ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismpolicy/comments/1gm710/can_admin_publicly_confirm_that_ratheism_mods_are/caljghd ) . 
  nah tor and circlejerk seem to be getting most of the ` blame ' . 
  [ i have no idea what you 're talking about ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2z6niks.png ), 
  of course it matters . 
  there 's a big difference between a guy getting fired mid-season for not getting on with his best player and a superstar discussing what would make a team more/less attractive to him . 
  good on him for being honest with the clippers and giving them a choice . 
  set to private, 
  you dropped an 's ' dingus . 
  mensright ** s **, 
  btw , i prefer the memeslayer . 
  i honestly had the thought this morning and actually went to make it . 
  turns out someone already has - / r/dailydouble - it 's relatively active by the looks of it . 
  where 's the karma and soapboaxing in that ? 
  gave me shivers . 
  i 'm sorry for what you went through . 
  i wonder how long we can last before someone posts the ` that 's a penis ' reactiongif . 
  i 'll be impressed if we hit the hour mark . 
  apparently the judges [ loved her ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzs6var2e30 ) the first time . 
  apparently , that 's her thing . 
  i do n't get it . 
  will june 2013 go down as the popcorniest month on record ? 
  go for it . 
  i 'll edit to explain, 
  oh god , for a second i thought that julia passed a bill about that cult [ landmark education ] ( http://www.landmarkeducation.com.au/ ) .

  rudd polls far better than gillard . 
  this was absolutely motivated by trying to give labour the best chance to win the next election . 
  choo choo motherfucker, 
  [ one of the many reasons i 'm happy about this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/emptd0w.png ) . 
  [ i explained preferential voting below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1h3l14/australia_julia_gillard_has_been_voted_out_of/caqi1st ) for any non-australians interested . 
  that 's team aba . 
  yeah , because he made them work really hard and had high standards . 
  good !, 
  it will be telling if shorten is the new treasurer . 
  i guess it worked because the [ more popular ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1h3l14/australia_julia_gillard_has_been_voted_out_of ) post got nuked . 
  it 'll be on netflix for the low low price of $ 68 a month . 
  it 's a wildly popular position in the people he 's trying to swing . 
  60 + year olds are n't voting for him anyway . 
  she was going to lose to abbott . 
  the entire motivation for this was that he has a chance to win , she does n't . 
  ca n't forget one nation . 
  no matter how hard you try .

  please , for the love of god do n't listen to my horrible idea .

  does n't matter . 
  a mod should ** never ** act like that . 
  especially considering that telling someone to kill themselves is actually a bannable offence in / r/adviceanimals . 
  by his own rules he should be banned . 
  i personally love the troll faces behind the freaks and geeks image . 
  nope . 
  apparently the / r/atheism mods are all tor sockpuppets ( i do n't think i 'd ever posted on there before this drama started ) because something something something . 
  i lose track . 
  can i also try to claim that anyone who steals classified information from their government and releases it to the entire world is a hero and not a dangerous criminal ?
