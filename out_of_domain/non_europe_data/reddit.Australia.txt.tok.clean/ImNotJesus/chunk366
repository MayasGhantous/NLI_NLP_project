  because , you know , there 's no reason that a government should have laws protecting classified information . 
  do n't worry , he was paid well by memedad to do it, 
  my theory on that song is that it 's the greatest meta-joke of all time . 
  what could ever be more ironic than writing an entire song about irony but not listing anything ironic . 
  the * song itself * is the irony . 
  i hope someone good plays me in the movie . 
  i do n't think it 's ironic . 
  he was just right . 
  he was justifiably afraid to fly . 
  did n't know the background to that song but i certainly heard it a lot ( had an angsty teen sister when it came out ) . 
  also , a wonderful example of a non-ironic line . 
  it is not at all unexpected that if someone is `` the man of your dreams '' , he 's also a wonderful fit for someone else . 
  you almost certainly appreciate ** most ** of the same attributes in a man as many other women . 
  not at all . 
  it 's amazing . 
  also , give me some . 
  hi jimdogs , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ) :, 
  * it has an improper title . 
  this is a violation of [ [ rule 1 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1 ) .

  i 've been a mod of at least one default for quite a while now . 
  i ca n't count the amount of times people have told me to kill myself . 
  i 've never responded by doing the same , nor have i seen another mod do it . 
  it 's pretty easy to ignore . 
  and if you ca n't handle being abused by users , you probably should n't be a mod . 
  just ban them and move on . 
  i understand where you 're coming from though . 
  i really want memeslayer to take off . 
  please start referring to yourself in the third person as the memeslayer . 
  thanks, 
  it would be far more ironic if he was an airline safety inspector . 
  this is one of my favourite things that has ever happened . 
  it 's starting to dawn on a few of them that `` woo no rules '' does n't work . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h5b39/proposal/ ) you can see them trying to work out what to do with meta discussion . 
  it 's like watching a newborn baby discover their own limbs . 
  edit : oh god , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h3n9h/nyt_snowden_through_the_eyes_of_a_spy_novelist_in/caqj5s9?context=3 ) is great . 
   skeen 's method , which as you may know recently ran into a mountain-sized speed bump , can still be improved upon . 
  the improvement we propose is to provide even * more * democracy by asking our users whether they really see your shit as a meaningful contribution . 
  so we 're essentially doing exactly what you are asking for . 
   it 's obvious to anyone that all you 're doing is provoking us . 
  it 's people like you who tempt us to pull the reins tighter in order to avoid events where even more freedom goes down the tubes . 
  the deeper you go the worse it gets . 
  ntp as a mod may bring on the may may july popcornpocalypse . 
  it 's about 90 % genuine , 10 % msf, 
  ca n't tell if you 're joking or not . 
  op really undersold with the title . 
  you just do n't understand because you 're not open-minded . 
  hey , you might want to edit in some np . 
  's before the mods nuke this .

  it 's a sad indictment on the rest of the country when tasmania continues to be the most progressive state . 
  or , that there 's more value in trolling/spamming a larger subreddit . 
  apparently my rhetoric is sublime . 
  that 's pretty kind actually . 
  i think you 're worth mentioning , worldonewon . 
  who instantly portrays self-righteousness ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/1gycsb/if_you_could_completely_change_the_rules_of_any/capzhay ), 
  that kind of looks like the first time i tried breakdancing . 
  / r/atheismmeta makes rebooted seem classy and rational . 
  i guess that 's because the most passionate few in rebooted also use meta . 
  honestly , i think it 's about 90 % serious and 10 % inciting . 
   you know ntp or someone on rebooted is going to post this with the title of `` proof ra sucks , their mod made fun of us '', 
  i think it 's well-known to most of them what i think of rebooted . 
  all it needed was `` i promise he wo n't rape you '' at the bottom, 
  yours is catchier . 
  this one time , this girl was friends with me . 
  i wanted to bone her but she did n't want to bone me . 
  what a friendzoning bitch , right ? 
  not a sixers fan obviously but as a basketball fan , ** i love this trade ** for both sides . 
  76ers fast-mode rebuild and have a chance to put together an incredible team in a couple of years . 
  meanwhile , i 'll pay money to watch a holiday-gordon-davis line-up any day . 
  a bit hard to keep the faith after another bad-looking pick . 
  i wonder if it was coffee flavour, 
  let 's all make fun of her saying something racist by being racist . 
  some people really see the world in black and white . 
  d ) all of the above, 
  overrated by whom ? 
  if i said that monta was overrated , / r/nba would say `` of course '' but many of my friends would n't . 
  are we talking average fan ? 
  lakers fan ? 
  hardcore fan ? 
  analytics nerds ? 
  all correct in my opinion and for the same reason - volume shooting and low effficiency, 
  lin as a backcourt partner does n't as make as much sense with harden than some cheaper pgs . 
  his range is a big problem . 
  psssst it 's also `` they 're '', 
  i do n't think i agree with any part of your top 5 . 
  wall , george , cousins , monroe then sanders . 
  i can understand putting george before wall but sanders 3 is a joke . 
  [ link ] ( http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=books/excerpt/nothingelse3 ), 
  i started watching the players i liked . 
  for a few years i went more for players than teams ( i loved cp but hated the rest of the hornets ) . 
  after a while , i just enjoyed watching the thunder the most and decided to latch on .
