  for one to assert a god does n't exist they must believe that assertion can be theoretically true . 
  therefore , if you 've asserted that god does n't exist you must also be gnostic . 
  again , remember that ( a ) gnosticism refers to knowledge while ( a ) theism refers to belief . 
  one can believe something with or without knowledge . 
  wow that was really randomly aggressive . 
  ah , i see where at that point where you stop making arguments and just start trying to act like a dick . 
  cool . 
  i 'll address the only point you made and then i 'm going to stop replying . 
  you asked what the position of `` someone who asserts that god does not exist '' is . 
  if one asserts that they know something , it is implied that they believe they * can * know that thing . 
  if i say to you know i * know * that my mother loves me . 
  it implies that i believe that one can know whether their mother loves them or not . 
  if it did n't , my position would be stupid . 
  therefore , if someone asserts they * have * knowledge , they are gnostic . 
  i 'm going by the dictionary definitions of the terms . 
  if you believe that the zeitgeist has changed the meaning of those terms , that 's fine . 
  all i 'm trying to say is that by the accepted definitions of the terms , he 's inaccurate . 
   agnosticism is the view that the truth values of certain claims -- especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity , as well as other religious and metaphysical claims -- are unknown and ( so far as can be judged ) unknowable . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] agnosticism can be defined in various ways , and is sometimes used to indicate doubt or a skeptical approach to questions . 
  in some senses , agnosticism is a stance about the difference between belief and knowledge , rather than about any specific claim or belief . 
  in the popular sense , an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in the existence of a deity or deities , whereas a theist and an atheist believe and disbelieve , respectively . 
  [ 2 ] in the strict sense , however , agnosticism is the view that humanity does not currently possess the requisite knowledge and/or reason to provide sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist . 
  tl ; dr while some people use it to mean unceratainty , the definition of the word is a question of knowledge . 
   atheism is , in a broad sense , the rejection of belief in the existence of deities . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in a narrower sense , atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] most inclusively , atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] atheism is contrasted with theism , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists . 
   1 . a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause , as god , and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable , or that human knowledge is limited to experience . 
  synonyms : disbeliever , nonbeliever , unbeliever ; doubter , skeptic , secularist , empiricist ; heathen , heretic , infidel , pagan . 
   2 . a person who denies or doubts the possibility of ultimate knowledge in some area of study . 
   3 . a person who holds neither of two opposing positions on a topic : socrates was an agnostic on the subject of immortality . 
  exactly , unless there 's evidence otherwise , the scientific position is that the null hypothesis stands . 
  there is n't sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in this case . 
  whether or not you care , if you believe that it is unknowable , you 're agnostic . 
  your first point is true in the specific case of formulating hypotheses . 
  however , we , as a practice , put the onus of truth on positive claims not negative claims . 
  for example , without evidence the chance of a unicorn existing is n't 50/50 , it 's considered untrue unless proven otherwise . 
  so you 're an agnostic atheist . 
  i 'd say that ** most ** atheists are agnostic and ** most ** theists are gnostic . 
  however , just because the position is unlikely , it does n't mean that the terms are wrong . 
  or he 's using a term incorrectly . 
  would n't be the first or last person . 
  not enough information to work out agnostic/gnostic but an atheist .

  ucla have a school for mindfulness meditation . 
  their website is a treasure trove of scientific information on mindfulness as well as providing some good practice meditations - http://marc.ucla.edu/ . 
  mindfulness is a very simple concept . 
  you focus on a sensation/sound/emotion etc. 
  and try to maintain that focus . 
  you will naturally get distracted ( this is fine and normal ) , when you notice that you 're distracted , calmly remind yourself of what you 're focusing on and return to that point . 
  it 's that simple . 
  you will be `` bad '' at it , which is good . 
  there 'd be no point `` practising '' mindfulness if it were easy .
