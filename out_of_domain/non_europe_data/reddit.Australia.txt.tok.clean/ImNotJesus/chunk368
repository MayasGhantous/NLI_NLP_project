  it 's hard not to when you 're so beautifully proportioned . 
  you 've got curves in all the right places . 
   and to continually demand a new answer until we are told the truth and spoken to like adults . 
  you 're assuming that the petitioners are right and the government is wrong in that case . 
  what if you get 100,00 racists who sign a petition arguing that segregation should be re-introduced . 
  with each answer , they all say they 're unhappy and demand answer after answer . 
  maybe he can teach you to take a photo the right way up . 
  i 've burned all pictures where my hair looks exactly like that . 
  according to the admins , it was planned well before the recent dramas . 
  i noticed in class that you use google . 
  i use it too . 
  we should totally hang out . 
   america is literally the most fascist place on the planet, 
  people that have never left america . 
  of course both parties are flawed . 
  also , given that they 're discussing complex issues , you 're never going to agree with everything that either party does/says . 
  however , i 'm sure there 's a party that represents you ** better ** than the other ( or a 3rd party alternative - it does actually make a difference in australia ) and you could educate yourself about which that would be . 
  alternatively , you could just arrogantly circlejerk about how all politicians are scumbags . 
  both work . 
  things that are not true :, 
  the loch ness monster, 
  the tooth fairy, 
  most campaign promises, 
  this, 
  that was great . 
  thank you,

  therapy worked very well for me . 
  been there and it got better . 
  5/6 years in total my life was hell . 
  i came out the other side and you will too . 
  it was hard work but i stuck with the therapy and turned my life around . 
  now , i 'm happier than i 've ever been . 
  first suicide call i ever took on a crisis helpline . 
  the adrenaline was insane . 
  either that or the time i got caught in a rip at the beach and started having a panic attack - causing me to start swallowing water and struggle to breathe, 
  i have ** two ** jordan wizards tops . 
  i do n't have any bulls ones . 
  alright guys , shut down evolutionary psych and genetics . 
  this guy has decided that a wildly outdated view of humans is true . 
  that i 'm lovable . 
  of course there is . 
  i never said they were equivalent . 
  i 'm saying that to deny there 's an evolved bias is wrong . 
  to say that nobody is born racist is n't really accurate . 
  when you were a part of a small hunter-gatherer community , `` trust the people you know and do n't trust the people you do n't know '' is a pretty good rule . 
  [ thesket explained it well in another comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1iquc7/nobody_is_born_racist/cb75u7y ) . 
  again , to be clear , i never said that we evolved to be racist . 
  we evolved to want to eat lots of calories . 
  that does n't mean that we evolved to be fat . 
  it means that we evolved a specific drive that can lead us in that direction . 
  well , if you once saw a baby do something we should probably throw out decades of research on the topic . 
  in-group is a very fluid thing . 
  there was a series of studies called the `` minimal group paradigm '' which basically tried to find out how little a difference is required between groups for there to be a bias . 
  it turns out that you can show all participants that you 're arbitrarily drawing them out of a hat and assigning groups and they 'll still show bias towards their teammates . 
  maybe change the title to `` one time rubberdong thought he saw a racist baby . 
  despite there being about 15 better explanations for what happened he 's probably just applying an explanation that confirms his already held beliefs . '', 
  but that might not be as catchy . 
  ... and it is ? 
   in-group bias does not refer to race/colour/ethnicity, 
  well that 's just not true . 
  in-group bias can refer to any grouping as tajfel comprehensively showed . 
  again , to be clear , as i 've said several times , i 'm not saying that in-group bias and racism are the same thing . 
  i 'm saying that in-group bias is an evolved mechanism that ** underlies ** racism . 
  whether you like it or not , you have a natural bias to favour people within your in-group . 
  as race is a commonly discussed and ( generally ) easily assessable grouping , of course our bias would be present there . 
  as for reciprocal altruism , it does n't only refer to times of need . 
  reciprocal altruism refers to a desire to be altruistic in the hopes that we will receive altruism in the future . 
  in fact , it goes against your point because people are far more altruistic within their own in-group as it 's more likely to lead to future received altruism . 
  lastly , i said several times that i 'm not condoning or defending racism . 
  i recommend that you re-read what i actually wrote . 
  i 'm not equivocating , the research shows pro in-group and anti out-group . 
  they 're both present . 
  it was probably an unnecessary digression to talk about the difference . 
  tajfel 's studies are just an example . 
  in-group bias is a very well established area . 
  yup . 
  people are actually pretty good all up . 
  we also have wonderful desires towards fairness , loyalty , minimising harm , altruism and all sorts of other morals . 
  what you said was n't actually racist at all . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being a 4 year old and having those thoughts . 
  your mum gave you a terrible response . 
  absolutely agree and well explained . 
  yeah , she should take an intro social psychology class . 
  see edit 4 . 
  race itself is n't the reason for the bias , it 's just a convenient category . 
  we have all sorts of innate traits before we leave the womb . 
  the tabula rasa conception of humans is very outdated . 
  absolutely . 
  i never said that we 're all fated to be racist . 
  psychology !, 
  are you really incapable of seeing the link between a ** very well established ** in-group bias and racism ? 
  you ca n't see it at all ? 
  if you think that 's what i 'm saying there 's no chance that you read more than a line of what i wrote . 
   in-group favoritism is likely learned behavior , not innate . 
  wrong . 
  there 's about 50 years of social psychology research that says otherwise . 
  it 's a combination . 
  i 'm still getting replies from people who completely ignored everything i said .
