  just because some people did some shitty things does n't mean that all people are bad . 
  absolutely agree and well written . 
  i agree with your overall point and actually have a very positive view of human nature . 
  i 'm just trying to elucidate the nature of one of those biases so people understand their own desires better . 
  the only thing i 'd counter is that you seem to be implying that our innate desires can only go in one direction . 
  however , there is obviously a conflict between different heuristics and biases . 
  while it is true that fairness is neurochemically rewarded , it 's also true that less fairness is shown to an out-group member than an in-group member . 
  our heuristics do n't always complement and sometimes compete . 
  there are parts of evo psych that are n't accepted by the wider psychology community . 
  however , the vast majority is . 
  i agree with pretty much all of your points . 
  to be clear though , i was n't trying to say that the title is necessarily wrong , just that it does n't explain the whole story . 
  any excuse to teach people about psychology !, 
  you 're misunderstanding . 
  you do n't have an innate bias to favour your own race specifically . 
  you have a bias to categorise into groups and then have a bias for the group you belong to . 
  only used them very briefly in two stints but they did help at those times when i was really low . 
  zoloft twice for about 3 months each time, 
  supported me during my depression . 
  that does n't make it a mental illness by definition . 
  til that medicine is n't science . 
  you 're the one who called it a mental illness not me . 
  i think you meant to say that a trait in which the person does n't reproduce does n't confer evolutionary fitness . 
  it 's not necessarily true but it 's the point you were * trying * to make . 
  i would gladly buy one and spend a lot of money on a ticket . 
  i convinced my fiance that we should have our honeymoon in america just so i can see an nba game . 
  might try to time it to see an away game . 
  only going to a few cities and i think oklahoma is a tough sell . 
  when there was a talk of an exhibition game in melbourne during the lockout i was overseas . 
  i seriously looked into buying tickets for an early flight home if the game was going to happen . 
  whether or not ** you ** should take multivitamins is something to discuss with your doctor . 
  as for multivitamins in general , steven novella ( a physician and noted skeptic ) has written extensively on it . 
  basically , he says that the overwhelming bulk of the research suggests that in healthy people with reasonable diets , there is no value in multivitamin use . 
  in fact , people who take multivitamins tend to have ** worse ** health outcomes than those who do n't .

  protip : admins ban for this . 
  if it 's a regular thing , they ip ban . 
  which torrent site ? 
  i think this is one thing that sam harris has generally explained very well . 
  there simply is far more danger within and without his own community from an extremist muslim than an equally fundamentalist jain . 
  i 've genuinely never heard a good argument for why it should be legal to ** sell ** alternative medicines . 
  at best they 're incredibly negligent about their own field , at worst they 're deliberately misleading people . 
  if i go into a store and buy a chair and that chair ca n't perform its most basic function ( hold the weight of a person ) , i 'd be entitled to not juts a refund but potentially damages from when the chair collapses . 
  what if there was a multi-billion dollar industry of selling chairs that do n't hold people 's weights ? 
  would you support that being legal ? 
  beyond it being a multi-billion dollar industry with an incredible lobby and marketing , why should we ever allow people to make money by persuading people to take potentially damaging substances or not use best medical practice ? 
  i just do n't understand . 
  the problem is the potential for abuse . 
  i 'm a moderator of a news sub . 
  what if website x offers me money to lower the weighting for competing websites ? 
  and that 's why we now regulate what tobacco companies can and can not say . 
  remember , tobacco companies do n't actively lie about the abilities of their products . 
  i 'm just really surprised by this . 
  i had no idea that with no evidence and only a two-line title reddit would turn into a mob . 
  i mean , there 's absolutely no history of everyone over-reacting to something with no evidence or context . 
  but , but rape is funny when it 's someone you do n't like right ? 
  right ? 
  when i realised that i make a small groaning noise when i sit down . 
  i demand a significance level,

  there 's an episode of the awesome show [ grand designs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-o2ggn29fi ) on the building of an underground house . 
  you ca n't . 
  you 're stuck with it . 
  why not make it a charge for spurious claims instead then ? 
  that seems like it would make a lot more sense . 
  your post has been removed as it breaks [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_rule_2 ) . 
  it is asking for advice about a situation that is specific to you instead of being a thought-provoking and discussion-inspiring question . 
  i understand it as a broad policy though . 
  they 're volunteers and laypeople , we do n't want them making scientific judgements . 
  fun : video games + movies + stand-up comedy, 
  growth : studying areas of interest, 
  mental health : meditation, 
  mine would n't taste like mexican food , i guess . 
  how to never lose at horse again . 
  i get that jennings is easy to hate on but this is actually a great trade for both teams . 
  the biggest knock on jennings was that he takes low % shots . 
  having some good bigs where he can run pick and rolls and play without the ball ( smith and monroe are both above average passers for bigs ) could be very good for his game . 
  remember , he has n't played with a playmaking centre before or anyone that demands a double . 
  they also kept plenty of flexibility by keeping their expirings . 
  for the bucks , instead of losing jennings for nothing they 're getting a solid young pg and a couple of usable pieces . 
  i think this is absolutely a win-win trade . 
  you forgot contested deep 2s, 
  so , this works because what you see is actually a pretty shitty picture and your brain fills in the gaps . 
  think about what happens when you run down a hallway with a camera . 
  see how unbearable the picture is ? 
  the reason that does n't happen when * you * run down a hallway is that your brain automatically adjusts . 
  your brain expects facial features to appear a certain way . 
  your cakeday does n't start until you log on, 
  my uncle 's house burned down recently . 
  irrefutable proof that the fire department does n't work and could never possibly stop a fire .
