  i 'm really good at accumulating comment karma when i want to . 
  i 've dropped out of the top 25 because i lost interest but about a year ago i had the 7th most comment karma on reddit . 
  the question was about talents . 
  of course i 'm bragging . 
  if anyone wants to say askreddit and then get banned just ask . 
  i wo n't lie , i know someone with narcolepsy and i take half a tablet before exams or if i do n't get enough sleep before work . 
  it 's pretty great but it 's certainly not without its side-effects . 
  if nothing else , at some point you have to pay the piper and when it wears off , you crash ** hard ** . 
  this is a wonderful trick for duck breasts . 
  if you start skin side down , you basically do n't need any oil .

  fun fact : studies show that the impact of sugar on kids is entirely on their parent 's perception of their behaviour .

  no problems buddy , congratulations on having an adorable son . 
  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them wanting money either . 
  that is , after all , their job . 
  maintain the sites functionality and increase profitaiblity . 
  maintaining it to a certain standard . 
  and reddit could undeniably be making a lot more money than they are . 
  tor are a ** very ** insignificant minority of reddit .
