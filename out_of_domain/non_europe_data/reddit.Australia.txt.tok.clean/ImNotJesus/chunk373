   it 's an acceptance - and mindfulness-based behavioral therapy that falls under the umbrella of cognitive behavioral theory , but is not a proper cbt . 
  really ? 
  i would 've thought it 'd come under humanistic or client-centred . 
  if i were doing an ama and the post had been open for over 2 hours , i would n't constantly refresh assuming posts would shuffle around . 
  in fact , i would avoid refreshing for that reason . 
  spot on . 
  they should receive tax benefits for any charity work they do but pay tax on anything that is taken as profit or re-invested into the church . 
  note : proselytising is not charity,

  anything that uses the word toxin is guaranteed to be a myth . 
  hyperactivity in itself is n't a disorder . 
  if someone said that ritalin 's effocaciousness was a myth , it would be a very different story . 
  it is a fine line , i agree, 
  he believes in no government intervention ... except in the issues he thinks there should be government intervention in . 
  looks like someone has a case of the mondays, 
  sure it is . 
  it means i want only serious answers , not that the topic is innately serious . 
  `` scientific illiteracy is the scourge of america . '', 
  `` woooo ron paul . 
  he 'll legalise marijuana . '', 
  i 'm removing this post because it 's impossible for people to answer it without giving implicit medical advice . 
  if you think that you may suffer from depression , talk to your doctor or seek out a local psychologist and get treatment . 
  it is a disease like any other and should be dealt with by medical professionals . 
  you may want to consider not posting yours and another person 's numberplates for the whole internets to see .

   for at least six years , law enforcement officials working on a counternarcotics program have had routine access , ** using subpoenas ** , to an enormous at&t database that contains the records of decades of americans ' phone calls, 
  sounds like a very good thing that , when appropriate , the dea has access to that information . 
  if there was no oversight or procedure involved , it would be a very different story . 
  i highly doubt that a pastor would n't know that there are explicit consequences laid out for homosexual acts . 
  i love the sentiment but there 's no way this happened . 
  hopefully my fiance . 
  the tricky thing to get your head around is not thinking in terms of `` intended '' or `` modeled '' . 
  try to think of things in terms of whether it increases evolutionary fitness . 
  that is , does it help you pass on your genes before you die ? 
  there are some evolutionary benefits to pair bonding but there are also evolutionary benefits to not pair bonding . 
  we do n't have a pair bonding gene because humans are much more complex than that . 
  whether we pair bond has a lot to do with society , parenting , friends , experiences etc. 
  the point is that you 're looking for a yes or no question where one ca n't be given . 
  we are n't `` designed '' in either way . 
  you can make the case that the state of israel would n't have gotten un approval if not for the holocaust . 
  yeah this has been widely disproven in the scientific literature . 
  an athlete saying it does n't mean that it 's true . 
  it was a somewhat popular view when the book the bell curve came out ( it also claimed that white people were innately smarter ) . 
  there 's really no evidence that either is the case .

  you really can . 
  you can do it statistically through the analysis or you can simply stratify ^ 1 your sample . 
  stratifying takes a lot more time so they probably just ( a ) account for the bias statistically ( b ) note the bias and/or ( c ) ignore the problem . 
  market research companies really are n't held up to the same standards as scientific research anyway . 
  a stratified sample is when you try to account for bias by getting an equal number of people from the relevant demographics . 
  so , even if they only call landlines , they can still stratify by having an equal number of people from different socio-economic classes , gender , age etc. 
  that 's why they probably would n't bother and just account for/note the bias . 
  avoiding sampling bias is n't always possible . 
  the vast majority of social psychology studies is on first year psychology students . 
  that does n't mean that the evidence is invalid , it just means that it needs to be kept in its proper context .
