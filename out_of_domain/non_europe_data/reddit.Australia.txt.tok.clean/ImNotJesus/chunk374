  i thought this guy was a bust . 
  he never said that she was * dry * , he said that she started to get wet 15 minutes in . 
  the story is stupid either way , i 'm just saying that it 's ** possible ** that he started with lube and she became wet herself once the process had started .

  hello curtis187 !, 
  your post has been removed because you have not provided adequate proof within a reasonable amount of time .

  all amas require proof . 
  hello throwaway_nvstmntbnk !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama .

  the difference this time will be the integration with / r/science . 
  we have 4 million subscribers to sell the idea to . 
  high quality, 
  it is still a science based subreddit so repeated postings to pseudoscientific websites may result in warnings and eventual bannings . 
  all views are welcome and any * scientifically rigorous * evidence that is skeptical of climate change will be welcomed . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's being set up by the / r/science mods , all of which are at least graduate students . 
  finding the balance between making it a more open/approachable area for science and maintaining quality will be a hard line to find but it certainly not going to become a memefest .

  i 've removed your request from iama . 
  we ask that when requesting public figures , users include some public way of contacting the person requested . 
  if you want , you can edit the post with this information and reply to this comment , and i will re-approve your request . 
  thanks !, 
  make sure to share some articles you like or make some comments . 
  it 's the early adopters like you that give the subreddit the momentum it needs . 
  this is fantastic news !, 
  this will retain a much higher level of scientific integrity than ifls . 
  while there is n't a requirement for peer-reviewed articles , only posts from reputable sources will be allowed and memes/joke posts are banned . 
  i promise that there will be no pictures of spiders with texts above it . 
  that really depends on the context . 
  if someone is going through someone 's posting history to try and identify them , they will be banned . 
  if someone goes through posting history to say `` you 've said x but here you 've said y '' it 's more likely to be okay . 
  that 's borderline stuff but the i 'd always err on the side of not doing it since admins do ban sitewide if you cross the line . 
  if you really needed to in that case , you could, 
  a ) message us and ask for our opinion ( we ca n't ban you if we said yes first ), 
  b ) say something like `` x posted in / r/trees with a picture showing he 's a white male '' . 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's really more referring to combing through someone 's posting history in an attempt to piece together their identity . 
   x said y in z subreddit, 
  should n't be a problem . 
  even if you directly link , they can still remove their comment . 
  either way , it 's irrelevant , you asked me a question and i suggested a safe way to do it . 
  as i said , it 's a borderline case . 
  as for babysitting , i care far more about the rights of people to not be doxxed than i do your right to `` call out a bullshitter '' . 
  the admins agree that a ban on personal information is one of the most important rules on reddit . 
  edited for clarity . 
  i did n't say that .
