  i said that admins take pi extremely seriously . 
  that was clearly a very separate point to your extremely specific borderline example . 
  this does n't mean you ca n't look at posting histories or even point out a single thing . 
  it 's really more referring to combing through someone 's posting history in an attempt to piece together their identity . 
   x said y in z subreddit, 
  should n't be a problem . 
  unholydemigod was suggesting the * as a way of denoting a fake name is being used . 
  in reality , it 's must easier to use only first names or even throw in a big ( fake name ) or ( name changed ) afterwards to be clear . 
  the emphasis here is n't to make a specific and fiddly rule , more just to suggest that any use of full names should be avoided unless it 's made ** explicitly clear ** that the name is fake/changed .

  okay , a lot to cover there . 
  i 'll do it each paragraph at a time :, 
  a ) links to original works are generally considered fine as long as they do n't constitute spam . 
  it 's not revealing personal information to link to a picture by john smith . 
  posting things you attribute as your own work is very tricky grey territory but is generally considered okay , depending on the context . 
  if you 're an artist and have a page that is clearly your art that appears appropriate in context , it would n't appear to be doxxing . 
  as always though , if you 're unsure it 's always better to consult the mods * first * . 
  b ) again this is fairly context dependent . 
  sorry , i wish these cases were more cut and dry but they can be messy for obvious reasons . 
  if you 're talking about x celebrity and link to something on their twitter that is appropriate in context , you wo n't be banned for that . 
  where it becomes a violation of pi is when social media accounts are being ** linked ** to reddit accounts ( obviously , linking / u/chrishardwick to his twitter is n't doxxing , as an example ) . 
  who constitutes a celebrity again is a grey area but i think this is fairly intuitive . 
  if the person is `` known '' and they 're also known to be that user account , it 's fair game . 
  if you 're making a post that reveals someone 's identity , it 's pi . 
  c ) the rules have n't changed - we 're just trying to clarify them for people . 
  if your account is almost 3 years old and you have n't been banned yet , it 's unlikely you 're breaking the rules . 
  however , you 're always welcome to check specific things with us . 
  hope that clears it up a bit , let me know if you 're still unsure about anything . 
  nothing in particular , there has just been a sharp increase over the last few weeks . 
  personal information does n't mean information that is personal to you , it refers to personally ** identifying ** information . 
  that is , you 're allowed to tell people you like glitter , you just ca n't tell people your name , email address , twitter handle etc. 
  the rules have n't changed . 
  sharing personally identifying information has and always will get your banned from not just / r/askreddit but the site as a whole . 
  we do n't govern private messages . 
  linking to a celebrity 's twitter account is fine . 
  connecting a reddit account to a twitter account is not . 
  for example ,, 
   did you see x tweet from this celebrity ? 
  is totally fine . 
   this is my twitter account, 
   this is x redditor 's twitter acount, 
  is not . 
  we 're ( mostly ) not monsters . 
  our number one aim is to make sure that / r/askreddit stays safe and fun for everyone . 
  you 've essentially suggested what i was intending to say . 
  sorry if it was n't clear , i 've made a lot of replies in this thread and it can be hard to keep track . 
  intent is the key here . 
  i suggested leaving it more ambiguous to be safe but overall , your interpretation of the rule is very much in line with how we govern it . 
  correct .

  if the redditor is a well-known celebrity and it is know that it is their account , you 're fine . 
  yes , but we do n't govern them . 
  that 's admin territory . 
  first names are fine, 
  while i would ** strongly ** recommend against it , we do n't ban for usernames . 
  yes . 
  sure . 
  i agree that it 's gross but it 's not personally identifying information . 
  we do n't make a distinction between your own personal information and others in the rules because we ca n't possibly verify all of those cases . 
  we 've been talking about it recently but it 's a tricky area . 
  as a rule , we make very few rules about the types of comments people can make and instead try to shape the questions instead . 
  assumed knowledge is fine . 
  there are always borderline cases , if you 're not sure , check first . 
  sourcing outside information is fine , just do n't link it to a person 's account . 
  that 's fine . 
  do me a favour . 
  write a message to the mods explaining your entire case ( feel free to copy paste ) so the other mods can see too .
