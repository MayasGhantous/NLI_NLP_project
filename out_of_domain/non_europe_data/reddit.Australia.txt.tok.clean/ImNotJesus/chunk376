  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1ur1bs/announcing_the_launch_of_our_new_sister_subreddit/ ) is the announcement we made in / r/science . 
   the idea behind / r/everythingscience is that it has a less restrictive rule set than / r/science . 
  on a daily basis we remove incredibly interesting news articles , educational videos , cool space photos and summaries of research that deserve a home . 
  however , / r/everythingscience will still be heavily moderated to ensure that all topics are about science and come from reputable sources . 
  so while / r/science only allows peer-reviewed articles , this subreddit has a broader scope and allows all posts that are scientific in nature .

  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  i sincerely wish you all the best in dealing with this tough time . 
  if you need some help finding a helpline in your area , just send me a pm .

  absolutely . 
  i do n't think it 's necessary to see it as a failing of the intensive care unit . 
  however , it 's probably a good reminder that the person is going through an extreme trauma , both physically and mentally .
