  9/10 as well . 
  i got the lightning one wrong . 
  i guessed !, 
  the moderators are all using our contacts to try and find scientists who want to come and talk about their work and/or industry . 
  however , we know that there are already lots of scientists and people who know scientists that regularly use / r/science . 
  so , if you know anyone who wants to get involved and is already established in their field , please make sure to [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience ) . 
  might as well try and contact them . 
  what 's the worst that could happen ? 
  i understand that this ruling goes against what a lot of you think but i 'll just weigh in with the reasoning . 
  firstly , this was a unanimous decision . 
  the mod who removed it ( not unholydemigod ) checked with the others and we all agreed . 
  while the reasons to keep it up are obvious , we , as a mod team , try to never moderate with a `` just this once '' attitude . 
  we get so many great `` just this one '' cases every day . 
  there are so many people out there with wonderful causes or really sad or inspiring stories that i 'd love to break the rules for . 
  unfortunately , the only way to be fair to everyone is if we ignore the username . 
  so , i understand that many of you are angry but all we care about is being fair to * all * users , not just the famous ones . 
   but honestly how many times a day do you get a celebrity in your sub asking to crush things for us ? 
  that 's a new one . 
   i think everyone understands the mentality of `` it 's the rules '' but at the same time , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for people on reddit to interact with a famous individual that many idolize . 
  except for his multiple amas , regular posts on / r/fitness and the new thread made for this exact topic on / r/arnoldschwarzenegger . 
  this post was advertising for a cause , plain and simple . 
  while it may be a good cause or a fun opportunity , we do n't want to be in a position where we decide which causes get to use the immense platform for free advertising . 
  if you think that the quality of askreddit can be improved by better questions , i strongly urge you to post some . 
  we do n't moderate the quality of content . 
  if people want to upvote inanity , that 's their right . 
  we also remove a huge number of posts from people with genuinely good causes or in horrible situations . 
  it 's hard to justify removing a post from someone asking for assistance when they have no money when we allow it for famous people . 
  edit : woops , missed a word . 
  if you have a suggestion for a rule change , you 're always welcome to [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit ) . 
  we 've put a lot of time and effort into making them the best we can but there 's always room from improvement and we 'd love to hear your suggestions . 
  the post broke rules 2 and 5 . 
  it breaks rule 2 because it 's a question that is specific to him and not a general discussion question . 
  this rule was added to stop `` what should i do in my incredibly specific situation '' type of questions . 
  it breaks rule 5 because it 's using askreddit as an advertising platform . 
  / r/ideasforaskreddit, 
  post it there and we can definitely have a discussion about it . 
  it would definitely be good . 
  one of the mods posted a link to the new thread but it 's been downvoted into oblivion . 
  posted by someone else . 
  he logged off . 
   however sometimes it is better to take a stand in the pursuit of quality rather than strive for the same old mediocrity that has perpetuated for years . 
  trust me , there are plenty of posts i 've seen on the front page that i 've wanted to remove because i thought they were not good quality . 
  however , i do n't think people want mods as arbiters of quality . 
  fair enough . 
  you can also send it as a message to the mods and we can discuss it there . 
  we have tried to contact him , yes . 
  however , with the volume of mail he 's probably receiving , i 'm not confident he 'll see it .

  hello this_is_my_7th_try !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  hello usernamewhy !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  i would love this . 
  it would be especially useful if it kept track of how many times the user had been timebanned . 
  when you click submit , there will generally be two little tabs at the top . 
  one will say `` link '' the other will say `` text '' . 
  make sure you 've clicked on `` link '' . 
  unless the moderators are breaking site rules , the admins are n't going to intervene . 
  at the end of the day , if the moderators choose to act in that way , it 's their right as ` owners ' of the subreddit . 
  that being said , this is the sort of thing that / r/shitredditsays is known for . 
  they ban almost anyone that posts so i would n't sweat it . 
  at the end of the day , if the mods are bad , you probably do n't want to be a part of their subreddit . 
  i understand you 're annoyed but it 's their subreddit . 
  if they 're not breaking site rules ( being rude is n't one ) , there is nowhere to escalate your issue . 
  i understand you 're upset but here is nowhere to escalate the issue . 
  the other mods would have seen that conversation and none of them chose to intervene . 
  it is their right as moderators to ban anyone and everyone from their surbeddit for any reason they like . 
  they are well known for banning indiscriminately . 
  you could try and send them another message ( i would recommend being as friendly and apologetic as possible ) but unless they decide to unban you , you are not going to get unbanned . 
  your post was removed for violating multiple subreddit rules . 
  some moderators leave messages when they remove a post but not all do . 
  it would be wise to review the rules before attempting to post again .
