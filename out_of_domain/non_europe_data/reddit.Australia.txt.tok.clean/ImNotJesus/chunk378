  rule 2 : it 's overly specific advice about your personal situation . 
  it 's not an open-ended question . 
  rule 6 : you 're asking for professional opinions . 
  hi tinyclark , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it has an objectively ` correct ' answer that could be found with research elsewhere - such as google or / r/answers , or is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  for those questions , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self . 
  * it violates [ [ rule 6 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_6 - ) : seeking medical , mental health , legal or other professional advice . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1w0hm8/how_to_jam_nosy_neighbors_security_cameras/ ) . 
  unfortunately , there 's no way to do it once you 've ticked that box unless you delete the post . 
  hey , you 're replying in the wrong place . 
  i think / u/manwithoutmodem can work out what you were trying to say but to make sure it 's clear in more popular posts you have to press the button that says `` reply '' under the comment . 
  if you put it in the big text box , it just sends it as another reply to the post and not a specific comment . 
  no problems buddy, 
  when you 're on the main page of a subreddit , there is a button that says `` top '' . 
  after you 've clicked that , a dropdown menu will appear just below there when the page refreshes . 
  press the drop down menu and it will give you different time periods . 
  each one will give you the top posts for that time period . 
  they see the edit if they open it after you edit . 
  some would argue that spending too little on welfare * is * fiscally irresponsible . 
  nah , that is n't doable , sorry . 
  there 's nowhere to formally ask . 
  the only way to know is to get him to post it and see the response . 
  it 's borderline but that 's probably a unique enough experience that we would allow it . 
  your posted is more suitable for / r/casualiama, 
  as / u/davidjayhawk has said , you need them to become inactive to be able to request their mod position be taken away . 
  one caveat is that if you can prove to the admins that they 're allowing sitewide rule breaking with these new changes , they may be able to intervene earlier . 
  the other options are, 
  hot : most popular of the last hour, 
  controversial : post with the most similar numbers of up/downvotes, 
  new : newest comments, 
  they have ccs that changes the look of it . 
  i 've shown you where to find it in this screenshot . 
  also , to make sure the person knows you 're replying to them , make sure to press the reply button under the comment instead of just typing in the text box . 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  it 's amazing . 
  hello ocreator . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  i like racing res to see if i can find my link in time . 
  how to submit depends on which subreddit you want to post it in . 
  each subreddit is different and you need to find the on that is appropriate for your link . 
  what sort of link is it ? 
  i honestly do n't know why people are n't angry [ all the time ] ( http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-antivaccination-movement-20140120,0,5576371.story#axzz2rb1waqxk ) about anti-vaccine people . 
  hello taitale_nick !, 
  your submission was removed from iama because ama submissions that include crowd funding campaign links must be eligible for an ama without the campaign for them to be allowed . 
  additionally , the focus of the ama must not be the campaign . 
  for example , that shows you all links to imgur.com . 
  just change the last section to whichever website you want to see . 
  it was really almost all just complaining about china . 
  not really , sorry . 
  if they disagree with you , even if it goes against rediquette , it 's their right to vote as they wish . 
  if , however , you start to notice that you 're receiving multiple instant downvotes the second you post , it could be a bot and then the admins will get involved . 
  if he 's spamming modmail on multiple accounts , you should contact the admins . 
  do n't engage him any further and just catalogue it all . 
  let the admins know whats happening and they may intervene depending on the severity . 
  cheating !, 
  i think this is an idea that all mod groups fantasise about but in reality it 's just about ego stroking and not serving the community 's best interest . 
  it 's not our role to `` teach them a lesson '' . 
  i ca n't help with formatting but just wanted to mention that you should be careful . 
  some moderators consider repeatedly posting asciis as spam because they take up so much space . 
  make sure to include the type of browser and if you use res as that can be important . 
  if you have automoderator set up , you can also then use it to send everyone a pm . 
  after making a post in the mod subreddit , it 's best to let everyone know because people wo n't browse there often . 
  try / r/techsupport . 
  this subreddit is for help with reddit itself . 
  i would make sellers of medicines that provide no scientific evidence for their claims responsible for any harm caused or delays to normal treatment . 
  alternatively , i would make all infectious disease vaccines mandatory unless you have a medical reason to not get one . 
  it 's a public health issue , not a personal choice issue . 
  it ca n't be done currently . 
  there was actually a post on / r/ideasfortheadmins about it recently but at this stage it is n't possible . 
  nope . 
  look at my posting history . 
  about half of my comments currently are in private subreddits that you ca n't see . 
  verified, 
  a whole lot of us just removed ourselves from a whole lot of subreddits . 
  i both love and hate this . 
  thank you and boo . 
  at least people will start hearing about / r/rightsubreddit . 
  the right subreddit for * you * . 
  automod moderates some seriously dirty subreddits . 
  i also now suddenly feel like squatting on / r/imnotjesus makes me look like a terrible person . 
  lucky i removed myself from / r/nazidressups two days ago ( not joking ) . 
  i ca n't even remember why i made that . 
  people have suggested this as a future feature but at this stage it does n't exist . 
  i find the easiest way to do that in large posts is to collapse the ones you 've already read . 
  to collapse it , just press the [ - ] at the top left corner of the parent comment . 
  well it just makes sense that a subreddit with multiple blowjobs would be better than a subreddit with a single blowjob . 
  have you deleted any comments ? 
  / r/mwmrebooted /, 
  i demand to be named and shamed for my stupid decision . 
  also , the subreddit still says `` created by imnotjesus '', 
  who do we message about getting you banned for posting a phone number ? 
  [ for those wondering ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1wegwr/last_night_the_reddit_staff_and_uhebug_met_at/ ), 
  did you copy that response from the last dinosaur related blog post ? 
  if you think that anyone is manipulating reddit for hits on their website , it 's always best to take it up with the admins .
