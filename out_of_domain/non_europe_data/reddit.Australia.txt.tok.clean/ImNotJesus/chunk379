  if your concern is vote brigading , pressing the report button is n't the best way to go about it . 
  i would suggest sending a message to the moderators . 
  if they do n't make sufficient efforts to sort out the issue , you should escalate by going to the admins . 
  reporting a post simply flags it for review . 
  if the issue is a significant sitewide rule , messaging the moderators directly is always appropriate .

  i have been getting blue screens . 
  first came up like a week after i bought the computer . 
  i have received them intermittently ( maybe one every 2 weeks ) ever since . 
  just a reminder to make sure that all of your comments are on topic and not personal anecdotes . 
  as this is a science subreddit , please try to make sure your comment is scientifically informed and not just your personal opinion about marijuana or marijuana smokers . 
  the problem i have is that windows no longer loads up . 
  i sent it in for repairs under warranty a week and a half ago and had it returned with nothing a but a new fan ( despite my 6 separate complaints ) . 
  got it back and had it on for 20 minutes before the screen went black . 
  i turned it off and back on and have n't been able to load windows since . 
  i called up the warranty group and the repairers and both say it 's a software issue if windows is n't loading and said my only option is to do a factory reset . 
  message the moderators and ask them to remove it for you . 
  [ i think we all know whose fault it was ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yfcgijj.jpg ), 
  so you think i should just factory reset it and run diagnostics myself ? 
  / r/iama ( assuming the one i 've been talking to is the real one and not a fake account ), 
  i ** am ** an / r/iama mod and that is where i have been speaking to someone claiming to be him ( just waiting on proof ) . 
  we allow people to post their ama where they wish and do not intervene either way . 
  amas that are so soon do n't get put on the calendar . 
  the problem is that there 's almost always a more specific subreddit someone could post in . 
  the reason people use / r/iama is the size . 
  if we tried to redirect dan in this instance , it would be pretty unfair favouritism , sorry . 
  but , you 've got a big enough user base that you could probably reach out to some fighters and try to generate your own amas . 
  it 's pretty easy to contact celebrities these days so give it a shot . 
  plus , if you get them to do an ama on / r/mma , you can always x-post from / r/iama ( just make sure you follow the guidelines ) and you 'll drive traffic to your sub . 
  in the `` to '' section , type / r / ( name of the subreddit ), 
  if your account has been shadowbanned and you do n't know why , the only people with answers are the admins . 
  you should [ send them a message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) . 
  link karma is , as you guessed , for submitting links . 
  everyone starts with 1 link karma and 0 comment karma . 
  you have 1 total comment karma because your karma total does n't include the automatic upvote you give yourself . 
  so , you have one comment with a score of 2 which means that you 've got a total of 1 positive vote . 
  they 're separated because they denote different types of contribution . 
  thats right . 
  self posts are n't a link and therefore do n't give you karma, 
  there 's no way to change your username . 
  you would have to make a new account . 
  you ca n't see a list of subscribers . 
  the only way to keep a list is if it 's a private subreddit and all of the users are approved submitters . 
  protip : be careful if you use it and you 're a mod . 
  do n't open anyone 's userpage or it will spam everything . 
  i managed to get windows to load up . 
  no idea how . 
  so , i 'm trying to install memtest but i 'm not really sure how to do it , sorry . 
  can you please help ? 
  thanks , 
  what exactly do you mean by attaching a domain ? 
  what are you trying to do ? 
  the icon is a reference to the type of post it is . 
  an aa + icon means it 's a self-post ( only text ) . 
  means that it 's an image or link that does n't have a smaller version . 
  on the right hand side of your subreddit there 's a button that says `` subreddit settings '' - [ direct link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nofaprelapse/about/edit/ ) . 
  in the area that says sidebar , fill out what you want the side to say . 
  if you want a banner that goes accross the top , you need to edit the css . 
  to change the snoo , that 's in the subreddit settings page too .

  / u/cupcake1713 has the patience of a fucking saint for not just shutting down that entire cesspool of a subreddit . 
   awesome , you actually called me a sheep . 
  you almost have bingo !, 
  your post has been removed because it does not include links to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in / r/everythingscience, 
  that 's not what peer-reviewed means in this context . 
  peer-reviewed means that it has been reviewed by scientific peers and published in a scientific journal . 
  as an australian - why do you call it football when kicking is such a small part of the game ? 
  if only there was some way to add 48 to 30 we could solve this impossible problem . 
  now i 'm just wishing that baseball was played on horseback . 
  that sounds like something you 'll need to [ message the admins about ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) .

  you ca n't really report a moderator unless they 're breaking site-wide rules . 
  moderators essentially own their subreddits and are permitted to moderate it how they wish ( as long as they fulfill some basic requirements ) . 
  two questions :, 
  1 ) how were you communicating with the moderator ? 
  was it a message to the moderators as a whole or with that one in particular ? 
  2 ) can you be more specific about the threatening nature ? 
  the answer to those two questions could change my advice . 
  hello prophetgonetoground !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  admins do n't reuse or give inactive accounts to people unless you 're the president . 
  this is definitely 100 % true because if i was secretly filming people naked the first people i 'd show are the police . 
  if you click the link , you 'll find that this is a psychology today article about sports psychology . 
  your post has been removed because it does not include links to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in / r/everythingscience, 
  if that 's the case , you have little recourse i 'm sorry . 
  the moderators are free to run their subreddits as they wish and unfortunately some are rude in how they do it . 
  hello superdex010 !, 
  i 've removed your submission from iama . 
  location-based amas go to [ / r/ilivein ] ( http://reddit.com/r/ilivein ) . 
  that 's something you 'll need to [ message the admins about ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) . 
  admins wo n't ban a user unless they break sitewide rules . 
  in this case , if the spam is excessive or overly abusive , they * may * step in but it depends on the specifics . 
  based on what you 've said , i would say that it would be worthwhile to send them a message and get their take on the issue .
