  i 'm struggling to understand your specific question but i * think * it may stem from a confusion between / r/all and your front page . 
  your front page ( reddit.com ) represents the top posts in each of the subreddits you 're subscribed to . 
  / r/all gives you the most upvoted posts on reddit ( adjusted for time since submission ) and it * does not * factor in subreddit size or if you 're subscribed to it . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  i 've never heard of that before . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  no , no , if they got elbowed in the head by an extremely athletic 6 '10 person they would stand still and take it obviously .

  if you want to use / all and not see certain subreddits , you can do that with [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) . 
  once you have it installed , simply put your mouse over the name of the subreddit in the / all list ( do n't click ) and a new box will come up . 
  press the button that says + filter . 
  jimmy carr is ** amazing ** to see live . 
  he does over an hour of written jokes and also invites the audience to heckle him as much as they want . 
  he has a couple of pre-written responses but he mostly just improvs the heckle battles and it 's hilarious . 
  [ 10 minutes of him with hecklers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzlllm7rgm8 ), 
  thunder play some pretty weird small-ball lineups . 
  not uncommon to see 3 guards ( including 2 pgs ) with kd and ibaka . 
  could easily imagine them closing games with russ + lamb/reggie + morrow + kd + ibaka . 
  also , while lamb has a higher ceiling , he 's not as good a shooter as morrow is right now .

  hello kingdotcom-ama !, 
  your post has been removed because you have not provided adequate proof within a reasonable amount of time . 
  please see the / r/iama sidebar for posting guidelines . 
  thank you !, 
  how did that link prove that you are you ? 
  nothing on that page says that you 're doing an ama . 
  both spellings are correct . 
  one is the british spelling of the word , the other is the american . 
  your submission has been removed because it is not scientific in nature . 
  nice article . 
  the debate over whether it 's under or overdiagnosed greatly distracts from the important issue . 
  some children have developmental disorders that greatly take away from their ability to keep up . 
  the debates over nature v nurture , medicine v therapy and over v under diagnosed are much , much less important than `` how do we best identify these issues and help the children involved '' .
