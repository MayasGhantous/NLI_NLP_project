  i think i understand . 
  you 're saying that they should be able to reply fast if they 're replying to a moderator but a limit if there are no replies in between . 
  yup . 
  i think the rate limit can be generous though . 
  there 's really never any need for someone to message the moderators say 8 times in 2 minutes , irrespective of mod replies . 
  makes sense . 
  removed pending proof, 
  you know better than i do what proof you have . 
  sure , send it through as a message to the moderators . 
  additionally , it 's worth remember that this is an ** ask ** me anything . 
  posts that are simply argumentative diatribes are being removed . 
  this is n't your opportunity to promote your own position . 
  we are very lucky to have these amazing resources visiting our subreddit , use the opportunity to ask hard hitting questions not going on a rant that will just be removed . 
  edit : for those wondering about the removed comments - the vast majority are actually from the same person who has made ~ 10 1 day old accounts to spam his own youtube page . 
  it 's there . 
  i just looked . 
  hey ,, 
  just a friendly heads up from one of the / r/science mods . 
  as many of you have noticed we are removing some things . 
  as i noted in there , a large number of those are the same person spamming their youtube page on a 1 day old account but we are also removing some other comments . 
  basically , we 're leaving anything that is a ** genuine question ** and removing things that are poorly disguised ( and sometimes not even disguised ) rants . 
  the point of this is to ** ask ** the amaer questions . 
  we are more than happy for you to ask pointed , hard questions and we invite it . 
  what we ca n't allow is for it to be a platform for you to rant about your personal opinions on climate change . 
  i hope this clears up any confusion . 
  you could have different sorting orders when logged in and not logged in . 
  otherwise i 'm not sure why the order changed . 
  not going to comb through the logs but it 's currently ` approved ' ( not by me ) . 
  i 'm guessing it was removed in error , not sure . 
  i 'm not sure what your concern is , sorry . 
  i 'm not sure how you think that the one sentence question is a rant but the 5 paragraph opinion piece is n't , sorry . 
  which part do you think is a strawman ? 
  there are no presuppositions made . 
  verified, 
  fun fact : i do n't respond to questions that end with `` fuck you '' . 
  i came here civilly . 
  also , more serotonin is n't necessarily better . 
  while being low in serotonin correlates with depression , it does n't necessarily follow that excess serotonin equals happiness . 
  to put it simply , not enough food makes you feel hungry but eating too much food can make you feel equally sick . 
  there 's a happy middle ground that exists for most things in the body . 
  thank you for your extremely relevant response . 
  this is unless you have reddit gold in which case it will show 100 . 
  it would be best to message the moderators of that subreddit as they will give you the most accurate information .

  not my area but recalled memories are remembered more fondly in hindsight . 
  if you also consider that when you remember something , you 're really remembering the last time you remembered it , this may be also a result of a continuous revision each time the memory is recalled to make it slightly more positive .

  not that it will matter for you this season but he also has an ** incredible ** track record against dwight .

  has n't someone come out as gay since retiring ? 
  maybe i 'm misremembering .

   owners of so many teams are completely inept . 
  you ca n't cause parity when some gms and owners are just better at their jobs than others . 
  revenue sharing is irrelevant when the people with the revenue waste it .
