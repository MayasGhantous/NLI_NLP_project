  1 ) we did n't protect any pedophiles , we just chose not to ban a user simply for claiming to be a pedophile on a different subreddit over a year ago . 
  it 's not our place to ban people based on what they do in other subreddits or claim to do in their personal life , irrespective of what we think of it . 
  2 ) we consider harassment the wrong thing to do in all situations , even when the person being harassed is someone we detest . 
  we do n't think it 's our place to choose who should and should n't be harassed . 
  the rules are there to be equally applied to all people . 
  3 ) the original discussion about whether or not it 's okay to mention if a girl has posted on gonewild was in a post about personally identifying information . 
  at the time we said that it is not personally identifying information because it does not fit under that banner . 
  however , we are all in agreement that it 's degrading and misogynistic . 
  we 're currently discussing how to expand the rules further to make askreddit a more welcome place to everyone and if you have any suggestions , please feel free to post on / r/ideasforaskreddit , we 're all very active on there and it would be great to hear from you . 
  if you ** ever ** feel like you 're being harassed or demeaned by another user on askreddit , please send a message to the moderator group or even pm me personally . 
  we regularly ban users for homophobic , racist or misogynistic comments . 
  if you have any questions , please feel free to ask me here or pm me . 
  sorry i was late to the post , only just came across it .

  i think ibaka will end up playing a lot more at the 5 . 
  i love adams but he 's not there yet . 
  i really hope this has helped you find some of the * many * resources that are out there to help . 
  i 'm sure that whatever you 're dealing with that hurts so badly you need to cut is incredibly difficult but you 've shown yourself that there 's a big part of you that wants to fight to get better . 
  that matters more than anything in the world . 
  keep fighting and it * will * eventually get better . 
  if you need help with any resources , please feel free to pm me . 
  i could talk all day about the misconceptions about psychology . 
  probably the most important one is that some people believe it makes you weak or broken to talk to a psychologist and deal with your feelings . 
  suffering from a mental illness or even just going through a difficult time is like dealing with any other illness , you go see a specialist and deal with it . 
  no one would ever call you weak for seeing an oncologist for your cancer , seeing a psychologist for your depression is no different . 
  the only weak thing to do is being too scared to get help . 
  whatever works is great . 
  the important thing to remember is that cutting serves a purpose , it 's helping you deal with a thought/feeling that you ca n't handle right now . 
  clearly though , this is n't working long term . 
  what you need to do now is find a better and more productive way of dealing with the thought/feeling or reducing the impact of it . 
  there are lots of ways to do that .

  / r/iama mod here : it 's terrible but there 's nothing we can do about it . 
  there 's always a more specific subreddit that someone could post in . 
  we do n't tell people where to post them and we do n't solicit amas . 
  we just facilitate the process . 
  it would make the process much more difficult ( remember that most famous people who do amas do n't know reddit ) , create an impossible precedent to maintain and reduce the audience for the person doing the ama . 
  so , as an nba fan i really wish the questions were better but it 's just impossible to do anything else . 
  the way for it to happen is for the moderators of / r/nba to try to reach out to players/commentators/coaches etc. 
  ( as / r/science is doing very successfully at the moment ) and try to get them on / r/nba specifically .

  we can remove the button but it 's pretty easy to get around if you know reddit . 
  it would just make it even more unfair for people who are on there for particular amas ( often the people with the best questions because they 're big fans ) . 
  we have .

  to be fair , most mods have between 3 and 10 notes on them . 
  perhaps we should clear those as a temporary measure . 
  i heard that he got kicked out of / r/atheism for being too atheist . 
  it 's not abuse if they 're lower ranked than you .
