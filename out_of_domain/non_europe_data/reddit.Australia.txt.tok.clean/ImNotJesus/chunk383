  hi throwaway_secondjob , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it has an objectively ` correct ' answer that could be found with research elsewhere - such as google or / r/answers , or is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  for those questions , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self .

  your submission has been removed because it is not scientific in nature . 
  the reason that you found some of them is that not all of your comments are in your user history page so you did n't actually delete every comment you 've made . 
  the only trick i can think of is go to the comment page on your user history and change the sort function . 
  it will show you a few extra comments you probably did n't delete . 
  it 's a longshot but might as well give it a try .

  hey , just letting you know that when you use the doi address instead of the nature ( or whichever journal 's ) website , reddit 's spam filter automatically removes it because it 's considered a link shortener . 
  just use the nature.com link otherwise you 're relying on a mod seeing it and fixing it for you .
