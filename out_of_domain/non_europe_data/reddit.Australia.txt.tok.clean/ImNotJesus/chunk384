  interestingly , the research on this is pretty clear : once you have enough money that you do n't need to worry about money ( i.e. , if you get sick and miss some time at work you wo n't lose your house ) , having more money has an extremely negligible effect on happiness . 
  the evidence suggests that money itself does n't make you * more * happy , it just serves to protect against things that make you * less * happy ( like stress ) . 
  no problems .

   i do n't disagree with feminism as a principle of equality , it is important to me as a female in a stem major . 
  i call troll . 
  i think the most frustrating thing about srs is that i really wanted to like them . 
  i want subreddits that call out the bullshit on reddit . 
  but , srs became a parody of itself and is so far removed from its raison d'etre that it 's depressing . 
  you know it 's actually possible for both to be true . 
  why does one have to be worse for them all to be shitty ?

  on the sidebar , the rules are dildos and dildonts and they call themselves a `` circlequeef '' . 
  if it was a serious subreddit about calling out bullshit , i 'd love it . 
  and that 's how it became a parody of itself .

  it may be . 
  it 's just why i do n't enjoy reading it . 
   reddit loves nothing more than someone who confirms their pre-concieved biases, 
  you mean like literally every other person in the world ?

  i do n't understand the point of pretending to be someone else on a date . 
  like , sure , if your sole intention is to try and have sex with as many girls as possible , you 're probably the kind of guy who needs to put on an act but if you 're actually looking for someone to spending a significant portion of your life with would n't you want someone who actually likes you ?
