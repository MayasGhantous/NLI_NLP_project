  this is a story about hiv , making jokes is in extremely poor taste .

  no need to apologise , just got see a doctor . 
  for anyone interested , there was actually an ama on / r/science today from a group of professors out of uc berkeley `` with expertise in reactor design ( thorium reactors , molten salt reactors ) , environmental monitoring ( fukushima ) and nuclear waste issues . '', 
  they spent a fair bit of time talking about fukushima .

  that would be fine . 
  i guess it 's possible but there is n't any good reason to think that . 
  it 's a fairly big claim , do you have any evidence ?

  i have 2 people following me around calling me a cunt at the moment . 
  luckily i almost exclusively post mod comments these days so now that they 're both banned from my subs they ca n't really do anything . 
  in case anyone was wondering - this was temporarily removed due to lack of proof ( all amas require proof ) . 
  proof was provided and the post was reinstated . 
  it was down for less than 5 minutes . 
  not much of a story here , sorry . 
  reddit does n't have that function . 
  mods can leave removal reasons easily but with no way to pin a comment it 's impossible for people to see it in a popular post .
