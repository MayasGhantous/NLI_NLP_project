  even if you have the best coaching in the world , against good defences you need someone who can create off the trouble or at least put some pressure on the d. unless you 're making defences rotate , you 're going to be shooting jumpshots .

  so what does this discovery mean for inflation theory and will it now become the prevailing model ? 
  what 's next for inflation theory ? 
  as a physics/cosmology layman - what does this mean for how i understand the universe ? 
   that the universe expanded faster than the speed of light at just a fraction of an instant after the big bang, 
  again , excuse my very layman knowledge here but i thought that one of the most cardinal rules of physics was that nothing can be faster than the speed of light . 
  do we know what made that rapid expansion possible and why it does n't fit within conventional laws of physics ? 
  feel free to discuss the ama here but he is only answering questions in the / r/iama post and not here .

  have you seen the musical book of mormon or seen the south park episode about mormonism ? 
  what did you think ? 
  how do you feel about how much mormonism is made fun of ?

  can i please ban this guy ^, 
  do you start sneezing and getting itchy eyes ? 
  maybe you 're allergic to fun . 
  you 're thinking of / r/shittyama, 
  not at all . 
  if a comment is calling you a range of slurs , we 're going to remove it irrespective of the votes . 
  we 're not just going to indiscriminately remove things . 
  only posts that are malicious towards a user or group or clearly only intended to inflame . 
   sure there are rules , but everyone on reddit knows mods do whatever the fuck they want whenever the fuck they want ,, 
  i strongly disagree that the askreddit mods do that . 
  we already remove a lot of them . 
  if you see them , please do report them . 
  can you please explain what is less enjoyable ? 
  we 're constantly trying to improve the subreddit . 
  i want to know specifics so that we can try to adjust . 
  thank you . 
  with the volume of posts we get here we could n't possibly keep up with posts if it were n't for the users who know the rules and report rule breakers . 
  as a five year old with a tenuous grasp of english i 'm hurt . 
  luckily it was clearly a joke . 
  yes . 
  we 've had considerable feedback from people that it 's upsetting and demeaning so we will remove it if we see it or it 's reported . 
  it 's pretty easy to tell from context normally . 
  you would n't believe how often two people use the subreddit to argue for literally days on end , consistently trying to one up the other person with their aggressiveness and use of ad hominem attacks . 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's not being malicious to a specific user or group . 
  banned . 
  my favourite part of any modpost is the `` let 's see how much of a borderline question i can come up with '' comments . 
  okay , i 'll take the bait . 
  again , it probably depends on context . 
  it 's pretty easy to tell when someone is slapfighting as opposed to joking around . 
  nothing worse than a disordered sex pile . 
   but honestly that 's just my two cents !, 
  i 'm asking for your two cents !, 
   but there are a lot of fine lines that intimidate people ( at least me ) and discourage me from commenting . 
  we try to make the rules as clear as possible so if there are any that you feel like are particularly confusing , please do let me know here or in modmail and we can work with you to clarify it . 
  alternatively , you 're always welcome to message us and clarify whether something breaks the rules and if so , how to fix it . 
  fictional bigotry is fine . 
  make it clear that the name is fake . 
  you can either use a silly name like mrs. fakename or say something like blah blah john smith ( name changed ) blah blah and it will be fine . 
  just make it abundantly clear you 're not referring to someone specific . 
  i know this is a serious post but here 's a dumb joke i just came up with that has been removed 16 times already . 
  huh ? 
  it was a joke . 
  notice how he replied to me ? 
  he would n't be able to do that if he were banned . 
   i feel like the easiest fix for this problem is to simply rephrase it . 
  virtually any question can be vague-atized to be suitable for this sub . 
  exactly . 
  just make the question not about you . 
  none of us want to go back to titles that are just personal stories with a question mark at the end . 
  what 's the context ? 
   what happened to the reddit where you could express your thoughts and opinions as you deemed fit ? 
  no subreddit is without rules or limitations . 
  you 've never been allowed to dox people or post cp . 
  we also do n't expect you to be pc , we just expect you to express your thoughts without being malicious and aggressive towards other users . 
  you 're still more than welcome to disagree or express unpopular views . 
  what we ca n't allow is people 's experiences on reddit being ruined by users who ca n't express themselves civilly . 
   it 's disheartening to see another forum adopt the fcc mentality that an adult ca n't eat steak because a child might choke on it . 
  that 's not an apt analogy because the action is negatively impacting on other users .
