  it 's more like people are going around shoving steak into everyone 's mouth and some people are choking on it . 
  while you may think that everyone should just have thick skin and not be offended by anything they read online , that 's just not the reality we live in . 
  again , we 're not saying that you ca n't swear or even get a bit heated , what we 're saying is that if you ca n't conduct yourself without throwing out racial or homophobic slurs maliciously , you 're detracting more than you 're adding to the subreddit . 
  as long as i get a nice dinner out of it . 
  we do remove them for that reason . 
  if you see any , please feel free to report them . 
   oops , did i offend you ? 
  not at all , i 'm just not very clear about what you 're trying to convey . 
   your auto bot removing clarifying text is fucking ridiculous . 
  people * are * allowed to clarify their question but not if it involves a several paragraph long personal story or their own answer . 
  we 're trying to make it so that questions live or die on their own merit . 
  everyone hated `` storytime '' posts . 
  the automod is not perfect so there are sometimes false positives but if that 's the case , just let us know and we can have a look . 
  there 's even a handy link on the automod message to do it . 
  in that case he 'd be banned . 
   but it does remove shit we need to answer the question -- even a few sentences long . 
  like what ? 
  i recently went to america on a holiday and had a giant $ 1.69 burrito from 7-11 . 
  holy intestinal distress batman . 
  i avoided it like the plague it would have placed on by bowels . 
  baja fresh is amazing though . 
  i 'm so jealous that our mexican food sucks in australia . 
  it 's a spammer . 
  i was actually in southern california but it was a burrito emergency and parking is a nightmare . 
  everything except the $ 1.69 burrito was amazing . 
  rookie mistake , i know . 
  you know you do n't need to make a throwaway to disagree right ? 
  i 'm not going to ban you for having a different opinion . 
  all of your quotes are referring to banning * ideas * . 
  free speech has and always will have limits based on the impact it has on the people around you . 
  i ca n't walk into a movie theatre and yell `` fire '' because people will get hurt . 
  i ca n't walk up to someone on the street and describe how i 'm going to kill them . 
  i ca n't stand in the middle of the streets with a giant amplifier ranting about anything i want . 
  again , these are n't bans on ** ideas ** . 
  you 're allowed to have any opinion you want , what you ca n't do is be so abusive to other users that it damages their experience of reddit . 
  that 's when your freedom starts impinging on the freedom of others . 
  and you know what ? 
  i care more about the freedom of a person to have an abuse free experience than i care about the freedom of a person to be an asshole . 
  just the same as i care more about the freedom of someone to not be assaulted more than i care about the freedom of someone to be able to do whatever they want with their body . 
  not if you look at his posting history . 
   unfortunately i would also like to partake in said ejaculation . 
  does n't sound unfortunate to me . 
  banned for impersonating a mod . 
  i genuinely wish they were less of a parody of themselves because i do think they serve a purpose . 
  we very rarely delete comments outside of [ serious ] threads on / r/askreddit . 
  if they have been , it 'll be one of 3 things :, 
  1 ) personal information was being posted . 
  2 ) medical/legal advice was being sought . 
  3 ) a witch hunt/brigade, 
  but what if i 'm replying to my 2nd cousin in our secret language ... 
  that 's right . 
  just make it ** abundantly clear ** that it 's fake . 
   i had a friend in high school named john smith ( changed for the sake of the story ) and he ... 
  is totally fine . 
  just make it unambiguous . 
  the problem is that keeping track of that would be an absolute nightmare , especially because the vast majority of posts get seen by a very small percentage of redditors . 
  til . 
  that place looks totally usable . 
  thank you . 
  post it on / r/ideasforaskreddit, 
  if that 's what you 're looking for , give / r/trueaskreddit a shot . 
  did you message us about it ? 
  that 's a site-wide thing . 
  try / r/ideasfortheadmins, 
  i do n't think they 're motivated to change it , no . 
  perfect, 
  that would lead to the account being banned in most default subreddits . 
  he stepped through with his left and then jumped off it . 
  as long as you do n't lift and replace your pivot foot it 's fine . 
  hi aly41 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it has your answer in the text box rather than the comments section ( [ [ rule 1 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1 - ) ) . 
  [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;subject=i%20had%20my%20answer%20in%20the%20text%20box&amp;message=fixed%20my%20post%20please%20review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/20vwfa/has_anyone_felt_lost_and_hopeless_depressed/ ) when you have edited your post to have it reviewed for reapproval . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/20vwfa/has_anyone_felt_lost_and_hopeless_depressed/ ) . 
  breaking news : people do drugs because the experience is enjoyable . 
  coming up next , we 'll discuss why people avoid touching the hot fire . 
  seriously though , be very careful . 
  just because says that their experience was spiritually significant it does n't mean that the experience has actually had a good impact on their life . 
  edit : please stop telling me how much mushrooms changed your life . 
  please . 
  we 're just moderators of / r/askreddit . 
  we do n't run all subreddits . 
  could be a little bit hard to co-ordinate doing it every month but no reason we ca n't make it a semi-regular thing . 
  well that 's in my head for the next few hours now . 
  * thanks *, 
  sorry , we get a lot of people who are confused about mods v admins . 
  thanks for the heads up . 
   if only the / r/askreddit mods outright banned `` controversial opinion '' topics, 
  i really , really want to . 
  he means deleted comments , not removal reasons for submissions . 
  hopefully the rule will reduce the need for removing but as a general rule , the slapfighting is normally pretty deep in the post and not top level comments . 
  others do n't tend to upvote 2 people arguing and name calling very often . 
  this is true but it 's not what he 's talking about . 
  he wants to know why people delete their comments . 
  full names , phone numbers , addresses , ssns etc. , anything that would lead to identifying someone 's real identity . 
   they 're looking to have a deep spiritual moment of satori/nirvana/enlightenment, 
  that seems remarkably confounding . 
  fine . 
  so meta . 
  open a restaurant !!,
