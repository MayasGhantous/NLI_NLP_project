  literally the nazi party, 
  shut up, 
  i love you, 
  you 're like / u/manwithoutmodem without all the annoying parts, 
  while i agree that wrongful accusations of rape are a big deal and should be prosecuted appropriately , saying that, 
   being wrongfully accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped . 
  is obscenely hyperbolic . 
  why is there a difference between have an accusation leveled against you that you can defend , where you have the upper hand in proving your innocence ( innocent until proven guilty remember ) and being violated in the most vile , vulnerable and violent way possible ? 
  being falsely accused of a crime is bad . 
  it should be prosecuted and it 's a shame that there will always be damage that you ca n't undo . 
  that does n't mean it 's in the ** same league ** as one of the most horrible things someone can experience .

  i did n't say that being falsely accused of a crime is a walk in the park . 
  in fact , in both statements i agreed it would be horrible . 
  there are plenty of things that are horrible that are n't the equivalent of rape though . 
  proof ?

  crisis counselor here . 
  a couple of quick points :, 
  * ** there is no advice that will fix this ** . 
  if there was a tip or a trick , they would have done it by now . 
  in fact , everyone in their life is probably giving them a million pieces of advice . 
  i guarantee you , the reason that your friend said that is because you 're the only one * not * telling him/her what to do . 
  * ** acknowledge their decision to continue living ** . 
  it 's not that hard to kill yourself . 
  the fact that they are reaching out to you means that there 's a part of them that wants to keep on living . 
  point that out to them and congratulate them on making the hard choice . 
  * ** just listen ** . 
  ask questions , try to understand what their experience is like even if you have n't had it yourself . 
  you might know what it 's like to go through x but you can probably guess how it feels . 
  say `` i 'm sure that felt y '' . 
  show them you * care * without telling them what to do . 
  if you 're talking to them and not sure what to say , just ask another question . 
  * ** take care of yourself ** . 
  taking care of someone who is suicidal is immensely difficult and draining . 
  make sure * you * have someone to talk to about it and do n't take on the responsibility of their life . 
  you help them as much as you can but it 's not your responsibility that they keep living .
