  they have to make that choice . 
  * ** if you feel comfortable , contract a safe plan ** . 
  what this means is making a deal for them to keep safe for x amount of time . 
  ask them what amount of time they can ** guarantee ** to stay safe for , even if it 's an hour . 
  then , make a plan for what they 're going to do to keep themselves safe . 
  this involves :, 
  1 ) disable their plan . 
  ask if they have a plan how to kill them self . 
  they probably will . 
  try to ask them to disable it . 
  this could mean cutting the rope or giving you the pills etc. 
  2 ) create a safe contact . 
  who are they going to call if they do n't feel safe ? 
  crisis line ? 
  you ? 
  a family member they trust ? 
  someone they can call 24 hours a day . 
  3 ) make a bit of a plan what to do with their time - watch a nice movie or play some computer games . 
  whatever makes them feel comfortable . 
  make sure they do basics like eat food . 
  4 ) ask them what has helped them to survive this long . 
  they are n't all of a sudden suicidal . 
  how have they dealt with previous times like this ? 
  acknowledge that they 've dealt with difficult times before and always survived . 
  * ** move them into professional care ** . 
  there are a very wide range of counselling and therapy services that can help . 
  therapy works . 
  if they 've done it in the past and it did n't , encourage them to try someone different . 
  edit : forgot an extremely important point . 
  ** from this point on , your safety and his/her safety is your number one priority . 
  ** if at any point you think that your or their health is in danger , you call the police ** immediately ** and feel no remorse for doing it , even if they beg you to not . 
  better to have an alive person that 's angry at you than a dead person who trusts you . 
  safety is ** always ** number 1 . 
  if you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to ask . 
  shit you made me forget an extremely important point .

  i do n't mean this as an us vs them thing . 
  i 'm just saying that if it 's an issue of not wanting to give it to everyone , can have a cutoff - be it subscribership or default status . 
  you 're not really understanding the issue . 
  i was n't asking how to more effectively show people the rules . 
  we just need more sidebar space . 
  this is n't / r/modhelp and i was n't asking for advice . 
  thank you . 
  yeah , i understand the need to cut down page size on views but a small bump in size should n't destroy anything and it would help us with some of the things we 're trying to achieve - especially in / r/science . 
  there 's a lot of code that goes into our sidebar which uses up characters . 
  it 's an interesting idea . 
  have a look at the / r/science sidebar - a lot of the space goes into the sort by flair and the top 5 posts in / r/everythingscience . 
  also , because tables are a nightmare to format , the ama schedule takes a lot of characters too . 
  thanks i 'll look into that . 
  a lot of the sidebar is clickable so it might not work though . 
  i 'm far from an expert . 
  that 's my understanding as to why modtools tagging has stopped working . 
  thanks i 'll pass that on .

  hi slightlyred , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it has an objectively ` correct ' answer that could be found with research elsewhere - such as google or / r/answers , or is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  for those questions , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/21aswy/life_is_just_a_downward_spiral_why_do_it/ ) .

  ooo nice idea . 
  what type would you make ? 
  i would make it illegal to sell or provide alternative medicine without scientifically valid , peer-reviewed evidence . 
  my logic is this , in all areas it 's illegal to sell a product that does n't work and you 're liable for the damage caused by it . 
  if i go into a furniture store , i have a reasonable expectation that a couch should be able to hold my weight and do its most basic function . 
  however , in the field of medicine , where we should have the ** strictest ** rules , we allow people with improper training to sell products that do n't fulfill their basic function . 
  it 's insane . 
  if you sell alternative medicine you 're ** at best ** negligently ignorant about your own field and at worst a disgusting charlatan preying on people in their time of need . 
  there is ** no benefit ** to letting them practice . 
  i really think it should be considered * basic * healthcare and negligent to not do so . 
  also , it does n't just affect their child , it 's a public health risk . 
  a lot of scientists actually believe that [ overpopulation is a myth ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/opinion/overpopulation-is-not-the-problem.html ) and that our numbers are actually plateauing and may go down . 
  absolutely .

  not vaccinating . 
  if you let your ideology get in the way of basic healthcare i think you 're a shitty parent . 
  i know nothing of chowders . 
  they 're not very common in australia . 
  any tips ? 
  interesting . 
  any suggestions on how to transform a veloute recipe to use stock ? 
  i 'm not great with sauces and i could n't find any recipes . 
  it 's the end of summer here ( australia ), 
  proof ?
