  i 'm currently a psychology grad student and was wondering if you could talk about the learning curve going from study to practice . 
  what did you find to be the biggest challenges ? 
  did you have any previous experience ( like phone counselling ) to help you and if not , how did you cope emotionally with some of the more demanding clients ? 
  i 've spoken to some therapists who think that you ca n't be a great therapist unless you 've gone through some therapy yourself , does your experience with ptsd help you relate to clients and their experience ? 
  proof ?

  it 's a review though . 
  this subreddit is for new studies . 
  we have a winner !, 
   i would ask the admins to add a modqueue symbol , like how modmail and messages work . 
  if something is reported the symbol will turn red . 
  mod toolbox does that . 
  enjoy, 
  your personal lack of understanding about how vaccines work does n't change the scientific evidence showing that they do . 
  sorry about him . 
  we do n't tolerate shit like that in / r/askreddit and i 've banned the user . 
  step 1 ) sell off a bunch of assets, 
  step 2 ) claim that you always have a surplus while the opposition are irresponsible spenders . 
  step 3 ) have idiots vote for you, 
  because then you have a guaranteed surplus , which , if you 're ignorant about economics and accounting , sounds like a good thing . 
  people understand simple concepts and favour immediate benefits over long-term ones . 
  surplus , good . 
  debt , bad . 
  who cares about the rest when you 're making sound bites for an election ? 
  medibank private is earning a large amount of money for the government . 
  i did n't say all liberal voters are idiots . 
  i said that idiots think that a surplus = a necessarily good economic policy . 
  they 're just a subsection of liberal voters . 
  there are plenty of reasons to vote liberal - racism , sexism , lack of empathy , short-sightedness , homophobia etc. 
  of course i 'm bitter . 
  i think this country deserves better . 
  if that means you ` win ' then congratulations but it says a lot more about you than me that that makes you happy . 
   enjoy the next 3 years . 
  the bitterness really shows your narrow thought process . 
  let me take a few hours to meditate on that deep insight you 've given me . 
  thank you for your different opinion . 
  even though every respected economist says that the best way to survive an economic downturn is to go into more debt . 
  they already sold them . 
   the govt is supposed to run essential services that can not be supplied by the market . 
  according to ? 
  read a krugman article once in a while .

  verified, 
  we actually do that already . 
  the problem is you just do n't get the same level of engagement if they 're not full time mods . 
  it 's hard because we want people with a science background who also have a lot of spare time . 
  there are two different things there :, 
  1 ) there are some quirky findings that faking a smile can make you happier . 
  2 ) taking a deep breath and paying attention to your environment is a part of mindful awareness , an extremely well researched and effective way to increase happiness and reduce distress .

  sorry but / r/science is for peer-reviewed content only . 
  i was wondering if you have any experience with long-term side effects of cerebral malaria . 
  someone i know was diagnosed with non-typical narcolepsy with some cataplexy features and the specialist believes that it 's a residual effect from the malaria . 
  she also suffers from aches and very inconsistent cognitive ability . 
  have you heard of any long-term side effects like that ? 
  thanks in advance !,

  spammer, 
  studies show that you gain more happiness spending a small amount of money on someone else than you do spending the same amount on yourself . 
  we 've evolved to be social animals and rely on reciprocal altruism , there 's great pleasure to be had from embracing that .
