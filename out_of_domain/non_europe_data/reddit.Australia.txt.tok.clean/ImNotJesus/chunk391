  hi dr moss , thank you for doing the ama !, 
  when you say that ebv can cause certain types of cancer , does that mean immediately * after * someone has contracted epstein-barr or does it just affect their odds of contracting cancer at some stage in their life ?

  hi unikraken , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) because :, 
  * it has an objectively ` correct ' answer that could be found with research elsewhere - such as google or / r/answers, 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement .

  proof ? 
  none of the comments explained the answer . 
  that 's why they were deleted . 
  it was unfounded conjecture and then arguments based on that unfounded conjecture . 
  in the 9 deleted comments not one had a citation . 
  sample sizes are almost always that small in brain scan studies due to the cost and time associated .

  correct . 
  not only is there no proof that you are in fact the person on that website , i was n't able to find anything on the website that suggested that you 're a health expert . 
  i would need to see some sort of evidence that you 're a qualified practitioner or researcher .

  proof ? 
   larger sidebar space , or a dedicated space for css scaffolding and related subreddits . 
  please be larger sidebar space . 
  we have a lot of code in the side of / r/science and we 're desperate for more . 
  also , can we ** please ** have a rate limit on reporting , especially for 0 day accounts . 
  i 've had an asshole recently go through an report all of my comments and everything on the subs i mod only to get banned and come back with a 0 day account and do it again . 
  there is no reason to ever allow people to report hundreds of things without it at least flagging for the admins . 
  alternatively , have reporting ` judged ' by how appropriate it is . 
  if people 's reports consistently get approved by moderators then they 're misusing the report button and are much more of a hindrance . 
  even show it as a score on their user page !,
