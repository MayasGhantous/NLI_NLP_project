  let people be proud of how good they are at reporting bad content - it would certainly make our jobs easier . 
  edit : partial credit to / u/ooer on the last idea . 
   modmail is apparently in a complete overhaul , but this particular request is duly noted . 
  thank the lord . 
  modmail is so poorly designed for what we need . 
  i think we all know that creesch is just in it for the modtools groupies . 
  apps not showing the sidebar is an extremely big issue that is n't being addressed and i do n't know what the answer is . 
  we ran out of room for notes on / r/askreddit months ago . 
  they can always delete it . 
  i 'm no expert but i 'm sure the ad revenue would outweigh the costs of making it pretty significantly . 
  if we made it something that people could be proud of , it would not only help run current subreddits but also identify future good mods . 
  i think having them scored on the userpage could be a * really * good idea . 
  would their name be attached to the `` super report '' then ? 
  hello seeofpoppies !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  by the way , reporting comments out of spite is a great way to get banned by the admins . 
  how would it be better/different than asking a certain subgroup of users to just modmail you ? 
  i might put that one up on / r/ideasfortheadmins anyway and see the response . 
  ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/22l4hn/reward_users_for_reporting_bad_content_by_having/ ) ), 
  that 's a lot of effort to go to since you would n't even be able to report it on the same account . 
  i think in most cases ( we do this in ar ) we remove the post with a removal reason and then reapprove once it 's fixed . 
  either way , it 's a fringe case . 
  admins already have stuff in place to stop people doing stuff like that for karma . 
  i 'm sure it would n't be hard to find if it were happening . 
  hello unrealvivi !, 
  i 've removed your submission from iama . 
  location-based amas go to [ / r/ilivein ] ( http://reddit.com/r/ilivein ) . 
  the problem with that is the space it takes up in the modqueue . 
  a report reason should be obvious . 
  if it 's not obvious , they should be sending a modmail message . 
  content the mods disapprove of . 
  that 's the point of reporting . 
  that 's why it 's a ratio instead of a flat score . 
  it means you have to be active * and * accurate . 
  banned from the entire website . 
  spamming the report button is considered to pretty major thing . 
  we have this on askreddit and it 's very useful ... mostly for making fun of the mod involved . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research .

  your post has been removed because you have not provided adequate proof within a reasonable amount of time . 
  please see the / r/iama sidebar for posting guidelines . 
  thank you !, 
  your submission has been removed because it is not scientific in nature . 
  proof ? 
  you know what they call alternative medicine that has been proven to work ? 
  medicine . 
  testing should be done by scientists in controlled conditions , not sufferers of illnesses who can have that illness become worse or delay the normal course of treatment . 
  proof ? 
  half of those results do n't even relate to parenting . 
  the description is n't often used and the search is clumsy at best . 
  it 's notoriously difficult to find subreddits on certain topics without just guessing at names . 
  if / r/spacedicks tag themselves as `` cute '' and `` animals '' it would be obvious . 
  as always , with gaming , it 's pretty easy to see when it 's malicious . 
  absolutely limit them . 
  maybe 5 max . 
  how else would it be gamed ? 
  no thank you . 
  it 's bad but there 's worse out there . 
  there are so far about 12 people who think they 're the first to say that they want to see it `` for science '' . 
  it 's pretty funny and original . 
  you should see some of the deleted comments when there are stories on cannabis . 
  obesity posts are maybe the worst . 
  edit : i said that there were 12 when there were about 100 comments in the post . 
  there are a lot more now . 
  mods are volunteers . 
  we work whatever hours we want to . 
  i clean up comments on / r/science because it helps to generate good scientific discussion and spreads science knowledge . 
  glad you enjoy it !, 
  yeh , it 's amazing how many people will all make the exact same ( extremely obvious ) joke and think they 're hilarious . 
  i like to play a game with myself where i guess the most common dumb joke in a post before clicking on it . 
  this post was too easy though . 
  if we do n't delete the stupid jokes there 's no room for genuine questions like the second half of your comment to be seen . 
  unfortunately , jokes get upvoted . 
  sure but my whole point is that people do n't know how to find new subreddits they 're interested in - especially new users . 
  that 's not exactly front and center or easily used . 
  almost all of the jokes are the one i said above and `` can i put one on my hand '' . 
  there you go . 
  a lot of people on reddit ** really ** hate fat people . 
  yup and i was just letting you know . 
  there are thousands of subreddits devoted to humour . 
  this subreddit is devoted to science . 
  even if it was the best joke i 've ever seen , it 's more important to be as consistent as possible in helping science discussion . 
  a few - not too many . 
  the last thing i want to do is bring extra attention to off-topic comments .

  correct .

  hello abstruse_moose . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities .
