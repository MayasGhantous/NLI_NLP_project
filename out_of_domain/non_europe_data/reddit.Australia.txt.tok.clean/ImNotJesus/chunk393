  hello teh_bacon_bandit . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities .

  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  here is an [ extremely long list ] ( http://www.csiropedia.csiro.au/display/csiropedia/products+arising ) of everything the csiro achieves . 
  i recommend having a look . 
  show them [ this ] ( http://www.csiropedia.csiro.au/display/csiropedia/products+arising ), 
  if you actually read the full paper and have read other papers in the moral sphere , it 's a direct counter to haidt 's social intuitionist 's model . 
  the purpose was to show that both emotion and reason are displayed - not one or the other . 
  i do n't think it did that particularly effectively since it argued against a strawman version of the sim but that was their intention . 
  how do you reconcile your clear desire to help people with the ( i hope ) knowledge that acupuncture consistently fails to outperform sham acupuncture in scientific testing ? 
  do you have a citation for the animal study ? 
  i 'd be keen to have a look . 
   if you ever had multiple needles stuck ( 4-8 ) deep in your back , you know it 's no fun . 
  evidence shows that a placebo that costs a larger sacrifice ( more expensive , painful etc. ), 
  has a stronger effect . 
   and , if medical science does n't believe in it , how come some ucsd medical clinics have acupuncturists ? 
  they 're either wrong or have access to evidence that i have n't seen . 
  both are entirely possible . 
  thanks - in the meantime , here is a review on a lot of the evidence that i 've found particularly interesting - http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/acupuncture/,

  because how you feel at any given moment is always fluid . 
  anything you feel now will change and vary over time . 
  that does n't mean that things will necessarily feel the way you want them to but you can always guarantee that it will change . 
  i volunteer as a suicide helpline and i 've talked to so many people who spent the first half an hour of the phone call trying to convince me that their life was impossible and nothing but pain but the second half finding reasons that they still want to live . 
  emotions , thoughts , feelings are temporary . 
  it sounds like you 're an asshole . 
  if that 's all it takes for you to steal from your friends ... wow . 
   and it does n't qualify as stealing if you post it to a public domain before you use it when it 's a code like this . 
  [ citation required ], 
  sorry , but you ca n't just take stuff that is n't yours . 
  if i leave my bag in a crowded restaurant , you ca n't just pick it up because its in a public area . 
   someone who is basically right but does n't have a peer reviewed double cross blinded study to back up what they are saying, 
  that 's kind of the point of science . 
  wrong until proven right . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  did you just say, 
   do n't be a victim . 
  to someone who said they struggling because of mental illness ? 
  i 'm assuming you go to oncology wards and give the same `` suck it up '' speech to cancer sufferers or do you reserve your self-righteousness for only the mentally ill ? 
  i ca n't believe people go for this `` if you 're not rich it 's your fault '' crap that libertarians sell . 
   i would submit a balanced budget to congress, 
  that 's a meaningless statement . 
  be specific . 
   he has specifically stated he would cut every single department equally, 
  so not actually based on logic or reason , just arbitrarily cut all departments by the same % ? 
  and what if his mental illness makes that impossible ? 
   i can not afford the therapist i know i need, 
  the vast majority of people who seek therapy are mentally ill . 
  if you consider that they said that it was for them and not a couple , that eliminates the most common subclinical reason for therapy . 
  they also said that it 's something they ** need ** . 
  assuming they are mentally ill is an extremely safe bet in this case . 
  did n't you realise that anyone who is n't rich is in that position due solely to personal failings of character ? 
  i volunteer at a crisis helpline and you would n't believe the number of calls i get from people who say that they do n't have the `` right '' to feel depressed because their life looks objectively good from the outside . 
  having a good job does n't make you immune to mental illness in the same way that eating an apple does n't make you immune to cancer . 
  in fact , it seems to make things worse in some cases . 
  sorry i was n't challenging what you were saying , i was trying to build on it and help people to understand that situation . 
   people actually believe in this fucking idiot ? 
  when i first responded to that statement , his comment was about 10 | 0 and i got downvoted * hard * . 
  it 's scary how many people believe that asshole .
