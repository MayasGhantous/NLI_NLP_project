  also , you forgot the [ vague non-answers ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/23qbtl/ask_gov_gary_johnson/cgzkom0?context=3 ) that he threw out to the rest of the questions . 
  libertarianism : where if you are n't a millionaire it 's solely because of personal failings of your character . 
  neither answer is great but the implied victim blaming from a governor is pretty pathetic . 
  also , not everyone who is suffering from a mental illness is currently capable of working . 
  while there * are * a lot of people who work extremely hard to continue in their jobs/lives while also suffering from mental illness , there are also a significant number who just simply are n't capable . 
  you know how we look back on earlier generations and ca n't imagine how they treated certain groups the way they did ( civil rights , slavery etc. ) ? 
  i genuinely believe that the way we will look back on the way we treat our mentally ill with serious regret and shame . 
  i agree but that refers more to the infancy of treatment . 
  it 's on the same level as trepanning . 
  what i mean is the social costs that sufferers of mental illness have to experience unnecessarily and the lack of support we provide for them . 
  hi gary johnsvarog321 , i lost both of my arms and legs in a car accident and ca n't afford to see any doctors , how best should i chastise myself for not being a better entrepreneur ? 
  exactly . 
  i 'd totally be a millionaire if i did n't have to pay taxes or something . 
  all of which makes the assumption that fiscal conservatism is good for the economy in the long term . 
  thank you for that well reasoned and researched response .

  a good trick with duck breast is if you put it skin side down , you know that it 's almost ready when it naturally lifts itself off the pan . 
  it should stick to the pan to begin with but when the fat releases it will unstick itself . 
  it 's relevant because uber are responsible for both the drivers and passengers . 
  taxi companies have mandated rules they have to follow to ensure driver safety .

  sorry but future proof is n't acceptable .

  hello suicidicalthoughts . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  that splattypus guy is a cunt . 
  we should be able to elect moderators . 
  he does n't represent me . 
  now that 's just rude . 
  that probably means you should be banned on this account as well does n't it ? 
  it 'd delicious . 
  almost like a balsamic-y tone to it , a bit tart but packed full of flavour . 
  very unlike anything else i 've eaten . 
  you can make it in a rice cooker pretty easily .

  hi comafly , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ), 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone . 
  for personal matters , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/23xx6q/my_grandma_just_turned_96_id_like_to_make_a_video/ ) . 
  this also does n't mean that you need to live for instant gratification . 
  in fact , living a life that 's enjoyable requires planning for the future and working towards greater goals . 
  i do n't think you can call reproduction a purpose because purpose implies something outside of it . 
  reproduction is the mechanism that caused us to be here , that does n't make it a purpose . 
  it 's like saying that breathing is a purpose . 
  what do you think about the state of science research in australia . 
  with the severe cutting of the csiro budget and clear anti-science intent from the abbott government , how do you think this affects australia 's ability to output science in the coming years ? 
  good question , that 's one of the difficulties . 
  i think you can come up with some pretty good general rules that are universal to western countries ( the vast majority of reddit users ) like child pornography . 
  so , if there were a subreddit called / r/childpornography where people shared pictures of naked and underage children , you think that it 's the responsibility of users who do n't want that to just not visit the subreddit ? 
  jailbait was allowed to live for a long time . 
  letting interested people know about it ? 
  of all the things that did n't happen ... 
  / r/thathappened / r/forwardsfromgrandma etc. 
  i have the utmost faith that this is more fake than a live milli vanilli concert . 
  that , like this , almost certainly did happen . 
   we 're not building an app to replace existing apps . 
  we are working more closely with developers of these apps to help them by improving our apis and talking more regularly with them . 
  as a moderator , please god make it mandatory to have subreddit rules on the app . 
  it 's more that when we have someone spamming the same comment multiple times in multiple posts within the same subreddit , we ca n't cite the spam rules as a reason for their banning . 
  the fact that admins * will * ban for spamming in only one subreddit is all the more reason to make it clearer .
