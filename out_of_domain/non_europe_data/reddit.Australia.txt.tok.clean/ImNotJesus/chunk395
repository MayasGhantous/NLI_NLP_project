  it has a lot more weight if you mention site-wide rules . 
  / r/conspiracy are idiots . 
  we 'll certainly survive if it 's not changed but not everything on / r/ideasfortheadmins needs to be a home run . 
  this is a pretty clear case of an easy fix with no real downside . 
  it 's true . 
  we removed it because 4 of the moderators in askreddit are on the mwm payroll it has absolutely nothing to do with rule 5 . 
  it 's definitely all a conspiracy . 
  once they heard that red 's postings were endangering our pfizer sponsorship the admins had to act . 
  i think we should all guess as much as possible without knowing any information . 
   also , in a very small subreddit i 'm not sure i 'd want all of my votes to be effectively public ( `` well , there are only 5 of us and 4 of us voted it up , so what 's wrong with you bob ? '' ), 
  how would people know who voted ? 
  how so ? 
  you can ask who has and has n't voted and try to infer but there 's no guarantee people will tell the truth . 
  even if there are 3 subscribers ; me , bob and john . 
  i suggest x and it receives one upvote exactly . 
  i know either bob or john did n't vote for it . 
  so what ? 
  i still do n't know * who * unless i ask them directly . 
  in any case , why would that necessarily matter ? 
  hello vargunos !, 
  i 've removed your submission from iama . 
  location-based amas go to [ / r/ilivein ] ( http://reddit.com/r/ilivein ) . 
  i do n't think that 's a good reason to make private subs less functional . 
  entry into a private sub is by invitation , if there 's downvoting there , it 's no the problem of the admins . 
  i agree that that is the biggest downside . 
  wait , what ? 
  you think that mods making a modpost is the same as regular rule breaking ? 
  is today your first day on reddit ? 
  do you also message the mods when an / r/askreddit mod post is n't in the form of a question or an / r/science one does n't link to a peer-reviewed study ? 
  i never thought we 'd have another memepocalypse but this is even better . 
  / r/technology are such conspiracy nuts and freeze peach idiots that it may be even more ridiculous . 
  i have nothing to do with these mods . 
  i 've never modded with any of them , i 'm just not so blinded by impotent rage that i still have common sense . 
  just a heads up , abusing the report button or telling others to is a great way to get shadowbanned by the admins . 
  you are well aware that the mods want this post to stay up and if you report/tell other people to , the admins wo n't look took kindly on it . 
  reporting posts is designed to make moderators aware of a post they may wish to remove . 
  you 're clearly using it , and asking others to use it , to harass them . 
  [ i just love how edgy and irony-free it all is . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24mt60/as_of_today_meta_posts_will_be_directed_to/ch8nzd4 ), 
  they 're literally calling them modzis . 
  okay , let 's work this through . 
  what do you think the point of reporting rule violations is ? 
  it 's true though . 
  i 'm obviously a cunt and a moron ( both used in the first 5 minutes of me responding ) because i have the gall to help run this website as a volunteer in my spare time . 
  i 'm such a terrible person . 
  right . 
  we 've already got that far . 
  why do you think that it 's important to tell mods when something breaks the rules ? 
  what do you think the purpose is ? 
  pfizer pay me in leftover xanax tablets to squash alt-med posts on / r/science . 
  lol, 
  exactly , remember that huge payout we got from the anti-socrates foundation to squash memes ? 
  muh free speech may is upon us though . 
  clearly the admins agree with me on this . 
  look at his account . 
  do n't fuck with the report button , the admins do n't like it . 
  you 're either being incredibly facetious or too dumb to realise but you 're obviously misusing the functions of reddit if you report this post . 
  continue to tell people to do it and your account will get banned too . 
  there are plenty of ways to voice your upset , just do n't break the rules of reddit . 
  genuine question : who do you think i 'm shilling for ? 
  i do n't know or care about any of these mods . 
  in fact , i think they 're pretty crappy mods and giving other mods a bad name . 
  haaaaahahaha, 
  let them eat frozen peaches, 
  do you see this as the equivalent of the french revolution ? 
  it 's definitely , definitely that and has nothing to do with how ridiculous and over the top both sides of this have been . 
  a popular one too . 
  terrible idea on like 16 levels . 
  hello wyattman854 !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  muh free speech may is my suggestion . 
  i 'm sure there 's better out there though . 
  the relative inaction of the admins is the untalked about story here . 
  they 're allowing ** another ** subreddit to be held hostage by downvote brigades . 
  i 'm sure there are bans being handed out but it 's incumbent on the admins to step in here . 
  the mechanisms that mods have to control the subreddit clearly are n't working and the inmates are running the asylum . 
  removing / r/technology as a default was long overdue because their mods seem pretty inept but doing it at that time only served to embolden the mob . 
  doing that and not publicly standing up to them looks like tacit agreement . 
  hello hope_itself !,

  sorry for the inconvenience !, 
  well , there are very few contracts that are still from the previous cba . 
  i do n't know , they could start with ** anything ** . 
  how about a post from an admin explaining that voting brigades wo n't be accepted and that the mods have the right to run the subreddit how they like . 
  i 'd settle for a modicum of solidarity , even if they do n't do something constructive . 
  edit : i mean something public . 
  i 'm sure they 're very busy behind the scenes banning the worst offenders . 
  my entire point is that we 're beyond the point of banning people . 
  it 's not one or two bad apples and this wo n't just blow over when they 're banned . 
  they 've consistently shown they wo n't act before they have to . 
  that 's why jailbait and creepshots lasted as long as they did . 
  hell , / r/niggers was n't removed until they were caught brigading . 
  john wall is looking like a legitimate superstar .
