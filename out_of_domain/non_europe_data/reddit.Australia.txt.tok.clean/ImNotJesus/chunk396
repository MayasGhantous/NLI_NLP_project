  i could n't agree more . 
  i mod three defaults . 
  i enjoy it and am very proud of it . 
  that being said , stuff like this terrifies me . 
  the admins have shown consistently that they do n't get involved until they absolutely have to . 
  / u/cupcake1713 and the new community mods are absolutely wonderful at helping you when something has already happened . 
  but , you ca n't let the inmates run the asylum and then only get involved once one of them kill a guard . 
  the guard is already dead . 
  it 's too late for them to ban someone who has * already * doxed me . 
  but i think to myself , i 'm in good mod teams who would n't do anything to bring that sort of reaction out but who knows though ? 
  / r/atheism tried to make you click one more time to view memes and people lost their fucking minds . 
  / r/technology had the gall to use automod like ** every other subreddit with more than 12 users ** . 
  both executed those decisions badly but they 're pretty minor changes . 
  who knows what will cause it ? 
  mobs are n't rational and once they get going , they build their own momentum . 
  i am certain that me being a mod on reddit ends as a result of something done by an angry user or group of users . 
  someone will dox me or bring real life consequences into the situation and i 'll be forced to step away . 
  i know for a fact this will happen unless the admins ** drastically ** step up and i do n't think it will happen any time soon . 
  they 're consistently a lot more worried about creating precedent than helping moderators to run their website for them . 
  it makes me extremely uneasy . 
  a discussion of appropriate topics can be found [ in the wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/wiki/index#wiki_8._what_topics_are_and_are_not_allowed.3f ) . 
  sorry , i should have been more clear . 
  i 'm sure that you 're banning people and taking out the worst offenders . 
  you know i 'm a big fan of you and the admins in general . 
  but , even though i know you guys are obviously doing things behind the scenes , when there 's no public response and the subreddit is undefaulted , it looks like tacit agreement with the angry mob . 
  they 're getting what they want at the moment . 
  the sub has been held hostage and the situation is so untenable that this * only * ends badly . 
  mods are going to get doxed or have serious , real-life repercussions come out of this . 
  it terrifies me as a mod .

  agentlame why do you hate freedom ? 
  it 's going to get worse before it gets better . 
  i guarantee you . 
  why not just hate shitty people in general instead of making it about race ? 
  about 6 months ago i completely cleaned my history of anything i would n't want linked to my name . 
  otherwise , i just try my best to stay professional and if people are assholes , people are assholes . 
  ca n't control the world . 
  you 're certainly right though that you should cut your teeth on smaller subs first , especially ones you 're passionate about . 
  then , find a default you 're passionate about . 
  they 're not doing it because they think it will pass . 
  they 're doing it because they think it will make the libs look bad when they vote it down . 
   given the context it 's interesting , because the reddit rules state `` do n't ask other users to vote on certain posts, 
  that 's exactly what he did n't do . 
  he 's encouraging people to be active in the new queue . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  you 're grasping at straws because you hate the guy . 
  it 's very clear what he was doing .

  reporting comments you do n't agree with is abusing the report system . 
  please do n't report other people 's comments unless they 're rule breaking . 
  if you continue to do it , i 'll be forced to forward it to the admins . 
  it does n't matter . 
  they 're not breaking the rules . 
  do n't report them . 
  i 'm still pretty new to sous-videing so if i want the internal to be 145f , i set it to 147f ? 
  oh wow , i went backwards . 
  should n't post when i 've just woken up . 
  thanks . 
  i thought that you 're supposed to set the water temp to 1c above the final core temp you 're aiming for . 
  it 's two long , rolled , pieces that are tied to be round with a diameter of about 2 inches . 
  thanks !, 
  most recipes seem to be for thin strips of loin and not a large , thick roasts like i have . 
  i guess i do n't need to . 
  had n't really thought about it . 
  should i just cut it up ? 
  what sort of dry rub do you like on it ? 
  ooo that sounds pretty delicious . 
  might do that . 
  i wanted to go mild on the seasoning since it has such a rich natural flavour . 
  proof ?
