  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  please , please call another election . 
  do it right now , after that budget , you 'll definitely win tony . 
  i 'll tell you what , the greens have been doing a lot to impress me recently . 
  hence the title saying that * he * thinks it , not that it 's an incontrovertible fact . 
  i work as a phone counsellor . 
  on a regular basis i talk to people who simply ca n't afford $ 7 to pay to go to the doctor . 
  i do n't have much money myself but until you 've actually talked to someone who ca n't afford to loan their adult son $ 5 because then they would n't be able to eat , you have no concept of making sacrifices or how hard some people have it . 
  it 's so easy to victim blame and pretend that it 's all because of their personal failings that they do n't have a job . 
  it 's fucking disgusting . 
  no one does n't have a job out of choice . 
  no one chooses to live in constant fear , wondering if they 'll be able to feed themselves . 
  no one chooses to suffer from the myriad of physical and mental illness that not only brought them into that position but are ** being caused by the situation itself ** . 
  i did n't choose to be born white and male . 
  i did n't choose to be born in australia in a time where life is pretty great . 
  i did n't choose to be born into a middle class family that could afford good schooling . 
  i did n't choose to be born without significant mental or physical illness . 
  i did n't choose any of the things i have right now and neither did joe hockey . 
  if you actually take a step back and consider how insanely lucky every single step needed to be for you to get here , you 'll realise why blaming people who have nothing is a level of disgusting i do n't have words for . 
  the point is that they 're fearmongering with debt numbers to push ideologically motivated economic policies through . 
  really ? 
  how is that editorialised or sensationalised ? 
  which part is n't from the article except for the `` just a reminder '' part ? 
  there are a few different theories in contemporary psychology that basically address why conservatives exist . 
  probably the most prominent is [ system justification theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system_justification ) which basically says that people who are naturally conservative are that way because there was an evolutionary benefit to justifying the status quo . 
  basically , that we should n't change things or try to move forwards because it 's safer . 
  inherent in that is a `` just world belief '' which basically means that people get what they deserve . 
  if you believe that poor people are poor because they deserve to be poor , it makes sense why you would n't want to spend money on helping them . 
  / r/askscience, 
  the reasoning for not banning those as well is that they ** can ** lead to discussion . 
  if people are asking for funny animated gifs , it 's certainly not going to be the most inspiring discussion ever but at least there 's something to comment on . 
  in nsfw link aggregation posts , what can you say beyond `` nice tits '' ? 
  we 've certainly discussed removing all link aggregation posts so if you 're in favour of that idea , i encourage you to post about it on / r/ideasforaskreddit . 
  that subreddit has a big impact on how we set out the rules . 
  funny , i suggested that in modmail only a few minutes ago ( although i think i 've suggested it in the past too . 
  what does everyone think about this idea ? 
  essentially , if you wanted a link based question , you 'd need to explicitly ask for more information . 
  for example ,, 
   what is your favourite ted video ? 
  why did that video appeal to you ? 
  what would be the reasoning behind that ? 
  we have n't been asked to do that by the admins and mods do n't see a cent of revenue .

  exum `` decided '' a while ago he only wants to go to la. 
  he wants to play with kobe who drove ** hard ** to have his agent recruit him . 
  he wants exum too . 
  exum will do anything to dissuade teams about the lakers to take him but he 's too good . 
  he has to say that . 
  they 're clearly outliers with a lot of leverage though . 
  the fact that unless you spend really poorly for the sake of spending , like the knicks and nets have , is a really interesting narrative here . 
  it depends which research question you 're trying to answer though . 
  i wonder if it would be even more accurate if you calculated games played x salary .
