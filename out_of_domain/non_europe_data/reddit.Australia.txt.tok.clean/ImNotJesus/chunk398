  you would n't want to have a $ 3 middy with abbott ? 
  i 'm finding these tables very hard to read . 
  which the libs will take as proof that people were going unnecessarily and the $ 7 fee acts as a deterrent . 
  if by interesting you mean depressing then sure . 
  it 's okay though because sick people do n't work and then they do n't earn money so they ca n't afford to go to the doctor which means they ca n't work . 
  to be fair , when has a class unanimously agreed that one student was the best ? 
  especially after all of this controversy , finding one person in her class who said that other people 's work ( in an extremely subjective field ) is better is wholly unsurprising . 
  that being said , if i were in her class , i would be fucking furious . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's not fishy , i 'm just saying that her classmate 's opinions on her work should be taken in the appropriate context . 
  / r/casualiama, 
  belt tightening at its finest . 
  i 'm glad he did n't do an acronym for the financial assistance grant program . 
  considering his party leader said this :, 
  `` mr hamilton-smith might think he can call himself an independent liberal but he is now a member of a labor cabinet . 
  with mr hamilton-smith 's background , he should understand what loyalty means . 
  clearly he does n't have a clue about loyalty . '', 
  i can completely understand why he would want to leave . 
  apparently thinking that politics is about representing the ideas you believe in above allegiance makes him a traitor ? 
  good fucking riddance is what i would think .

  charlotte and brooklyn compared to grizzlies and clippers . 
  on the season , lebron 's ts was 64.9 % while kd 's was 63.5 % despite kd playing better opposition on average . 
  small sample sized cherry-picked data is dumb . 
  he has shot slightly worse in the postseason and has 1.4 less apg but more rebounds . 
  otherwise his numbers are very similar . 
  i think we can attribute that to the quality of opposition . 
  the guy is still averaging 30 . 
  while this may just be posturing , i ca n't help but think this whole thing will lead to sterling getting more money for the team than he would have otherwise . 
  the media circus around this has caused ( a ) an incredible amount of attention and ( b ) the opportunity for whoever buys it to be the `` saviour '' .

  it 's getting really easy to like the greens these days . 
  they 're young , * actually * left of centre , know their shit and seem to care a lot about the welfare of australians . 
  it 's novel in politics but pretty exciting . 
  marijuana is n't a voting issue for me . 
  environment , healthcare , secular public policy , welfare etc. 
  are things i care about far more and in all cases they 're far more progressive than the two big parties . 
  same here . 
  i always line everything up so that i can finish my oxford on the same turn as economics finishes . 
  i 'll try to have money saved up so i can instantly purchase 3 factories ( assuming i find coal ) and get a jump on the first ideology . 
  if you time everything well , you can end up with foreign legions taking on crossbowmen . 
  for those that do n't know , mediation refers to when one variable explains the relationship between two other variables . 
  a and c might have a strong relationship . 
  however , if you also factor in b , the relationship between a and c grows weaker ( partial mediation ) or disappears ( full mediation ) . 
  in this instance , it means that the changes in moral judgements are affected by whether the behaviour serves your interest ** only ** when it changes your liking for the perpetrator . 
  i think the key to something like this - trying to get massive faith * or * culture - it 's really important to not neglect other parts of the game . 
  if you want to be able to build faith-based wonders , you need to have the science to support it . 
  if you want to be able to build and spread unencumbered , you need to have enough army that people do n't pick on you . 
  as for race , any of the generally strong races will give you a stable enough civ to build freely . 
  if you want to be very specialised , i 've found that spain is actually quite good if you can find a faith wonder early . 
  alternatively , boudicca gets a modest bonus and theodora probably makes the best use of the higher faith .

  always monument to the gods . 
  i really wish they 'd go less for shock value . 
  some of their policies are actually really reasonable and if they were n't so busy trying to make headlines and be edgy , they 'd be a much more viable third party . 
  15 % can be the difference between a game-changing wonder and a paltry refund for time lost . 
  also , percentages scale .
