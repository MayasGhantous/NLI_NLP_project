  eh , i like pumping out wonders early , i think it gives you a big headstart . 
  petra , terracotta army , great library , colossus , hanging gardens are all pretty useful in a lot of situations . 
  i understand your reasoning though . 
  it 's genuinely overpowered .

  thank you for your wonderful conversation article . 
  my question is this : given the high hopes of the `` decade of the brain '' , do you think that we 've underestimated just how complex the brain actually is and how long it will take until we can understand it from a biological perspective ? 
  not at all . 
  the study is saying that how you judge other people who do immoral things is related to if their actions serves your own interests ** only ** if it makes you like the person more . 
  you can get it 75 % of the time if tech straight to writing and build it asap . 
  if you can get +15 % speed from culture that helps a lot too . 
  i meant on immortal , have n't tried deity . 
  that 's the difficulty i play on and get it ~ 75 % of the time . 
  it 's a risk but i 'd rather have less expansion and a small science boost early on .

  ** do not forget that this is an ideological budget and not a cost-cutting budget ** . 
  the chaplaincy program was given an ** additional ** $ 250 million dollars in the budget while education lost money . 
  it is nothing to do with belt tightening and everything to do with hard-right religious conservative politics . 
  the first challenge failed . 
  funnily enough , i think this actually increases the chances of it getting struck down because it takes away the secular option . 
  you mean the wrong ones ? 
  obviously you just teach them about the right god . 
  it 's not only the lack of expertise , it 's also that the chaplain 's opinions are going to be objectively harmful in many situations . 
  what 's going to happen when a gender confused child or children struggling with their sexuality seeks help from an authority ? 
   but the article itself has all the exaggeration and misinterpretation of science journalism . 
  then how is it / r/science 's fault if it 's an issue with the entire field ? 
  unfortunately , most people do n't have journal access or the technical knowledge required to make the submission rules include only the journal article itself .

  the befrienders website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental .

  i was thinking about russ yesterday and trying to work out how his career will be remembered , despite all the ( often unfair , sometimes fair ) criticism he receives . 
  realistically , he could average , say , 24-8-5 with 2spg for the next few years . 
  the only player who has ever had that stat line for a season is mj and i do n't think it 's unrealistic . 
  assuming he ages well ( big assumption ) , can russ be a hall of famer ?

  i use * a lot * of planes , especially if i have a tech advantage . 
  anti-aircraft is strong if you have only a few planes but if you start a war with 8-10 ( i try to have brandenburg so that all of my planes start as self-repairing ) , you can take out a city on your first turn . 
  also , if you 're against the computer , i 've found that they tend to attack allied city-states before they attack you . 
  if you use your bombers to defend the city-state you can prolong that defence and really cut into their numbers . 
  city-states normally have high defence buildings but low troop numbers so a bit of air support can really help them out . 
  that 's if there ever is money . 
  it 's not due to start for a few years .
