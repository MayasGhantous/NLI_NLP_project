  and clothes, 
  he 's an australian politician who ran for prime minister ( our version of a president ) in the most recent election . 
  he 's catholic and ultra conservative but can often be found in a pair of speedos : [ do not click this ] ( http://images.smh.com.au/2009/12/02/939745/abbottbeach-420x0.jpg ), 
  make sure you keep us updated, 
  tell him to go to talkatheist.org, 
  he 's on to me ... dad get me out of here ... not again, 
  to my understanding ( from speaking to a psychologist who specialises in child gender issues on this exact topic ) about 25 % of children born with ambiguous genitalia identify themselves as the opposite sex and only 5 % say that they wish it had n't been done . 
  the psychologist told me they highly recommend the parents do the surgery because ambiguous genitalia on children makes it almost impossible for them to develop enough of a gender identity to be able to decide freely for themselves . 
  edit : i 've received a lot of responses to this so i just want to be clear . 
  i am personally not an expert but had a conversation about this topic with someone who is considered to be . 
  i do not know if his statistics are correct or not but the conversation was only a week ago so i 'm certain they are what he told me . 
  i know this is a really complex issue and as i said below i do not want to make it sound simple . 
  i just thought it was worthwhile posting ** an ** expert opinion on the topic . 
  do n't forget the old testament specials : genesis & granola , exodus & eggs , leviticus & lemonade , numbers & noodles and my personal favourite deuteronomy and dumplings, 
  as long as you do n't get any porn on the pancakes . 
  i understand it must be an incredibly difficult position and i did n't want to make it seem uncomplicated . 
  i debated whether or not to post that but decided to because i thought it was really valuable information on a topic where all of the answers are very scary . 
  ( australia ) if i could change anything i would make sellers of anything offering ** health ** benefits much more liable if their product has no scientific backing . 
  hey hashbashmash ,, 
  there are a few problems with ` fiddling with one 's own psychology ' . 
  even the best therapist in the world can not understand all of their own behaviours ( or probably of their partner either ) , it 's just not possible . 
  it 's hugely important to have the capacity for psychological change and i thoroughly commend you for it but it would be remiss of me not to strongly encourage you to see a therapist given that it sounds like your anxiety , depression and daydreaming are significantly affecting your life . 
  please understand that i do ** not ** think you 're incapable of having a positive impact on your own life but as someone who is probably more like you than you realise you should know that seeing a good psychologist allowed me to completely turn my life around ( to the point where i 'm now studying psychology myself haha ) . 
  perhaps you could tell me why you decided not to see a psychologist and i can help you with that because there is often an unfair stigma attached or a misconception . 
  irrespective of whether you seek help it 's really great that you 're trying to improve yourself and you should be very proud of yourself . 
  what 's your complaint about that thread ? 
  i think under your new laws you just lost yours, 
  that 's on the pretty minor end of the scale but yes . 
  the major people to be targeted would be alternative medicines . 
  i do n't think it should be legal for homeopaths to sell a drug they say will help prevent malaria , i consider it to be criminally negligent . 
  really like it , well done, 
  ignore the bogans ( our version of rednecks ) up north . 
  it 's like how they all go towards the heat in texas , you do n't want to be there . 
  melbourne and sydney are where all the culture and beauty is . 
  wow i did this too and did n't even realise . 
  since i can only upvote this post once i clicked on your name and upvoted other random things for sheer awesomeness of this post . 
  thank you sir, 
  i doubt they 'll know , you do n't have to put your address or anything . 
  at least he 's intellectually honest about it . 
  i ca n't expect everyone to be an atheist but he was presented with information and took it on intellectually , good on him for that . 
  it 's not just ** generally ** useless it can also be very harmful . 
  do n't risk it . 
  do you have a link ? 
  these joke threads lack a serious porpoise, 
  it 's only been up for about 4 days, 
  ummm except if you read the article their ` demand ' was sony doing a press release . 
  there 's 0 chance of it happening but it 's clearly their motive . 
  the puns in this thread are completely unbearable . 
  and my axe, 
  this may be your finest work to date . 
  it 's his first blowjob , even if he faps first it 's going to last 30 seconds unless he 's incredibly drunk . 
  really ? 
  how often do you give them tom ? 
  i yell bombs away . 
  that 's a lie , i yelled it once and my girlfriend was not happy . 
  fair call , did n't account for that . 
  my first was from a chick with a tongue ring who had clearly done it before . 
  i 'm ** not ** jesus ... seriously ... 
  i 'm not ... please do n't crucify me again , that shit hurts . 
  this is the best story i 've ever heard, 
  worth it ? 
  comment of the day for me , well played sir . 
  if you pause it looks like cum all over his face, 
  lower in the thread he did, 
  i 'm not jesus , i 'm just a very naughty boy . 
  i accept your apology in the form of upvotes . 
  same thing happened at the start with me and my gf , she got practice and can now do it in an ad break . 
  positive reinforcement !, 
  raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain, 
  there 's a book called : ` the brain that changes itself ' by dr norman doidge about neuroplasticity that spends a chapter talking about sexual fetishes . 
  the whole book is a brilliant read , would recommend it to anyone . 
  it 's also almost identical to a quote from christopher hitchens in the portable atheist, 
  hi billy mays here, 
  people with achey stomachs ? 
  it 's probably all that chipotle, 
  upvote for username, 
  i seriously just started welling up in my lecture, 
  it 's free in australia too, 
  ** puts on sunglasses **, 
  not a fan of the system, 
  please do n't bring that up , i 'm still really hung up on the memory and it makes me very cross to think about . 
  edited because of double post, 
  there 's a reason they call him casper the * friendly * ghost, 
  edit : okay apparently people do n't like jokes about mentally challenged albinos, 
  edit 2 : okay apparently people do like jokes about mentally challenged albinos but only if you acknowledge how incredibly wrong it is to make a joke about a mentally challenged albino . 
  captain , she 's going down, 
  then you 'll see , that it is not the fan that stops , it is only yourself . 
  if you can dodge a wrench , you can stop using a crappy os, 
  this man nose the answer . 
  i get so adenoid by this problem . 
  i 'm sorry folks , that 's probably the worst pun i 've ever made . 
  til that i do n't live on an island, 
  thanks for keeping us abreast of this story . 
  better bring the dumpster too , just to be sure . 
  i have a fortune telling unit ... in my pants, 
  come together , right now , over me . 
  it sounds like your coworker is, 
  ** puts on sunglasses **, 
  i get it , you 're being sarcastic because you 're upset that he explained the joke after you 'd heard it and that annoyed you . 
  this happened to me except in the first 3 slides i was already fat .
