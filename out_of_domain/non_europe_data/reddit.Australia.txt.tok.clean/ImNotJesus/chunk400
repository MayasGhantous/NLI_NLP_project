  funds that build up over time have a tendency to disappear when `` the economy is worse than we thought '' . 
  i think it 's almost always opening patronage and getting the policy that gives you a resting point at 20 . 
  i think it comes in handy . 
  before i finally launched an attack , it was something like 25 cities to 4 . 
  luckily for me , there was a city-state between us that they attacked first so i used my air fleet to bomb their army while cahokia defended like champs . 
  in the meanwhile , i hit two cities from the side and started a domino effect . 
  one of the most fun games i 've played . 
  have you tried closing and reopening the game ? 
  that really depends on what civ you are , what your location is like , what the other civs are doing . 
  there are general things that are always important ( keep track of diplomacy , make sure your happiness is high enough to expand , always push your science forward , have a big enough army that people do n't try to bully you ) but there 's no one size fits all strategy . 
  that 's a terrible poll question . 
  why would you ever ask a compound question like that in a poll ? 
  what are you supposed to answer if you want labor to block the budget with the aim to massive changes ? 
  yeah , i went and read the rest of the report . 
  number 2 you just linked makes the above question pretty superfluous . 
  it 's a silly forced-choice question that is intended to skew results . 
  i had a look . 
  [ this question ] ( http://essentialvision.com.au/opposition-vote-on-the-budget ) makes it pretty superfluous because it does n't need to be a forced choice question and you get far more information . 
  making it forced choice skews it heavily . 
  if they had a decent coach and team cohesion ( i 'd ideally want boogie coming off the bench ) , that team would beat the heat . 
  i do n't agree . 
  the simple fact is that if you 're answering that question and believe that labor should strongly contest the budget but not necessarily force a new election , you do n't have an appropriate answer . 
  given that 53 % feel that way , it 's a bad question . 
  it 's ** strongly ** skewing the results . 
  the question lacks validity . 
  who is guarding boogie , love , kyrie , lawson , melo , dragic , ad ... 
  it 's a team full of guys who can score 20 and many of them are * decent * defenders even if they 're not elite . 
  you could make do with a combo of aflalo , melo , smith , hayward , thad rotating on them . 
  hell , let 's drop green and bring in avery bradley to d up wade . 
  also , my team is extremely athletic and i 'm very deep . 
  i 'm running a second defender to lebron and always having either sanders/ad on the floor to defend the rim . 
  my point is that it does n't though . 
  when you 're doing a poll/questionnaire , you 're looking for two main things : reliability ( consistency over time - e.g. , your iq is the same today as it is in 2 weeks ) and validity ( is the question answering what you think it 's answering ) . 
  that question has extremely poor validity because it 's not measuring if people think labor should aim for a re-election , it 's measuring a general sentiment against the budget . 
  they have proof of that in another question . 
  you already have sanders and ad . 
   only one ball , also still have n't told me who 's guarding lebron , i see him dropping 30-40 on this lineup with ease which will help open up the floor for his teammates, 
  see the edit - i 'm doubling him on the dribble and beating them with my depth , lane defence and athleticism . 
  while there are no elite defenders , i 've got plenty of solid one-on-one defenders . 
  as for ball movement , i 've got solid passing bigs and wings . 
  even though i do n't have a huge apg centre , i think the ball moves a lot . 
  i 'd be running a lot of pnr too . 
  also , plenty of those guys play without the ball . 
  either way . 
  i just want ad or another rim protector always on the court . 
  that 's rough , man . 
  are you on good terms with him ? 
  wow !, 
  it was n't backhanded . 
  that 's mostly because there 's a pause in the motion as it gets to his shoulder , similar to what fisher does . 
  it 's a great improvement and i 'm sure there 's a reason that they 're teaching him that way but it seems like he would be losing a lot of the momentum through his legs and making it more of a push than a smooth flow . 
  breaking news : peta searle has since been raped and peed on . 
  afl actually has a surprisingly large female supporter-base . 
  as someone who used to be quite socially anxious , what i found as i got to know people better is that everyone else is so busy with what 's going on in their own head that they really do n't have brain power or care enough to analyse you . 
  the vast majority of people you meet , especially as an adult , * want * to like you and * want * to get along with you so they 're not spending the time or effort nitpicking at everything about you in the way that * you * are . 
  at the end of the day , i think dating and meeting new friends should be a process where you act like your self and if someone likes who that is , they 're the kind of person you want to be friends with or date . 
  if they do n't , well , that 's probably a good thing to work out . 
  ** tl ; dr ** you 're not the only person in the world who worries about what other people think and they 're far more focused on themselves than they are on you .

  were they all trying to publish `` business secrets of the pharaohs '' ? 
  yeah , i quit that game pretty early because i was dominating too hard . 
  add 8 faith and double bonuses to those wonders and they 're just so overpower . 
  from memory , one of the great barrier 's had fish underneath it too so extra food as well .

  just give me lake victoria , great barrier reef , king solomon 's mines or fountain of youth and i 'm as happy as can be . 
  i love being able to choose the ruins and the boost to your new cities is useful too . 
  what a weird map . 
  it also makes it a pain in the ass to move any units around . 
  it just makes the early game feel slower and more painful .

  by all objective measures , we live in the best world that has ever existed * . 
  no time in history have people been less at risk of violence , had better access to food , education , healthcare or equality . 
  we 're literally smarter ( although we may have hit some ceiling effects based on recent research ) , stronger , faster and live longer . 
  humans have consistently improved the world for ourselves so much that we can spend hours complaining about shit that does n't matter . 
  there 's no reason to think that will change any time soon .
