  we do n't have reposting rules so they can always delete and resubmit . 
  hi makeithappencapt , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 5 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5 - ) and appears to be soap-boxing , or otherwise is a rhetorical or loaded question . 
  you 're welcome to rephrase it and post again in a way more inviting of real discussion . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/27f26j/how_on_earth_do_these_people_believe_they_deserve/ ) . 
  you should try / r/trueaskreddit, 
  there is a better way to do it but [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=flair%3aserious&amp;restrict_sr=on ) can help you for now . 
  we remove those . 
  just report them . 
  you need to kill some of their units or make some more of your own . 
  the computer bases their offer on how much stronger or weaker their army is than yours . 
  they 're also generally more willing to go for peace if they 're at war with someone else but it 's harder to get people to declare on them once you 're already at war . 
  if you have good gpt or spares of resources , try trading for a luxury resource or two from the other teams . 
  only do it if they have a spare though ( as in , more than one ) . 
  exactly . 
  one of the best parts of honour is that you can get a scout/shrine much quicker . 
  if the question is such that it would be impossible to tell a serious answer from a non-serious answer ( e.g. , what is your favourite joke ? ), 
  we remove it . 
  sorry marklovin but i 've had to remove your post for violating rule 1 . 
  your personal story ca n't be in the title . 
  you 'll need to remake the post with references to yourself being homeless in the textbox or as a separate comment . 
  sorry for any inconvenience but titles ca n't be edited . 
  someone got access to a mod account . 
  it has been happening to lots of mod accounts in different defaults recently and it will be reverted very shortly . 
  i 've messaged the rest of the mod group ( i have no css knowledge and will break something ) and also messaged the admins . 
  this is an extremely minor inconvenience and will be fixed in a matter of minutes . 
  edit : just spotted that links were enabled as well and that was fixed . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  all amas require proof . 
  feel free to make a new post when you have some . 
  when people say that i always wonder what they would think if i responded `` omg , i 'm like so totally cancer about that '' .

  hi yourmomspenpal , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ), 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone .

  arxiv is n't peer-reviewed i believe . 
  well that was oddly aggressive . 
  feel free to remake the post but with a better title . 
  unrelated : if your name is a comedy bang bang reference i love it . 
  i like stauskas more as a fit . 
  that did n't fit as a username ?

  hi shalene , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it has your answer in the text box rather than the comments section ( [ [ rule 1 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1 - ) ) . 
  * this topic has been deemed inappropriate for a [ serious ] tag . 
  please try posting this topic again without the tag . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/27x84z/siblings_of_reddit_what_games_did_you_play_with/ ) . 
  honestly , any of parker/wiggins/embiid will fit nicely . 
  i know noel and embiid are similar but it could be the basis of an all-time great defensive team , especially with a high steals guy at the point and some athletic wings . 
  proof ? 
  hello thundercougar9 . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  yeah , i still think the answer is having a petition system where an overwhelming majority can remove a higher ranked mod but i do n't think they 'll ever go for that . 
  i 'd settle for a lower bar . 
  yeah that 's why you make it a process instead of an automated system . 
  it would be instantly apparent to anyone that you 'd been adding mods . 
  alternatively , you could make it that someone has to be a mod for a minimum of 3/6 months to vote . 
  your submission has been removed due to a sensationalized , editorialized , or biased headline . 
   you guys always say, 
  do n't assume what i think or say based on your opinion of other people . 
   trying to get rid of higher mods than you in your defaults just seems like a power grab . 
  it 's not about power . 
  all of the defaults i work in are run as * teams * where no one person is in charge . 
  that 's the exact reason * why * i do n't want people coming in and unilaterally making decisions or messing up the subreddit in some way when they have n't been contributing anything . 
  / r/jokes, 
  my concern is that i have a pretty average conceptual understanding of stats . 
  i know the difference between types of analyses and know enough to work out what i need to use but really struggle to get my head around the more technical side . 
  i 'm worried that r is going to just be too difficult for me . 
  done . 
  your post has been removed because you have not provided adequate proof within a reasonable amount of time .

  thank you !, 
  your submission has been removed because it is not scientific in nature .
