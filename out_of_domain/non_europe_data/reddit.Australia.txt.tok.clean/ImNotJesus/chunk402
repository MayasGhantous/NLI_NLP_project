  i just tried that pick up line on my wife . 
  she was n't impressed . 
  i 'm gon na treat you like i treat my math homework : work on it for 2 minutes , give up before it 's done and then pretend it does n't exist . 
  cars !, 
  my first car was hit 4 times in 3 years ** while parked ** . 
  all in different locations . 
  the last time it was in my driveway and hit with such force that it mounted a short brick wall and was a write-off . 
  i used the money to get a new car which has almost completely broken down in the last 2 years and is worth almost nothing now . 
  i ca n't even drive it .

  you literally spammed the same 3 emojis constantly . 
  it 's a discussion subreddit . 
  i do n't understand which part of that is difficult to understand . 
  yes , we allow * some * novelty accounts that respond in ways that are ** relevant ** to the topic at hand . 
  that has been our rule for a long time . 
  your comments ** are not ** relevant and you are simply spamming a small range of replies . 
   let nothing ( or nobody ) slip past the rules or remove it entirely . 
  we have tens of thousands of comments a day and we 're a small team of volunteers . 
   why is there a ` no novelty ' rule if it does n't apply to everyone ? 
  there is n't a no novelty rule , there 's a no novelties that are always off-topic rule . 
  which novelty accounts are you referring to and are you sure they 're not banned in askreddit ? 
  we allow only a very small percentage of them . 
  all good pal , thanks,

  as a mod my one and only aim is taking away everyone 's free speech and shilling for monsanto/big pharma/israel, 
  bottle up your emotions . 
  if you do n't feel anything , you 'll never have to deal with your deeper issues . 
  at worst , if it starts getting too much to hold it down , just have a drink whenever you feel something and it will relax you . 
  fair enough . 
  i figured that may be the case .

  thank you !, 
  you ca n't really call it evolutionary support because of the time scale . 
  generally , for something to confer evolutionary advantage , it has to be something that is useful over many , many generations . 
  since job interviews are relatively new , that is n't the case here . 
  however , that does n't mean that narcissistic-like traits ** were n't ** useful on an evolutionary time-scale , we just ca n't assume that from this study . 
  well , i do n't think you can reduce it to that extent but i think the underlying message of this paper is that job interviews require a specific set of skills that narcissists and people from more individualistic cultures tend to be better at . 
  it would be very interesting to see how that relates to job performance over x amount of time . 
  i did n't say that they do n't affect every generation or that a large-scale event ca n't have a drastic impact , i 'm saying that for something to confer enough genetic advantage to make an evolutionary argument for the usefulness of a trait it needs to be something you can trace back a significant number of generations .

  those are examples of different behaviours found in people high in narcissism . 
  it 's not how they measured narcissism . 
  81 degrees celsius for about 9-10 hours . 
  give them a quick sear first and place on mash with some sauce - it 's fantastic .
