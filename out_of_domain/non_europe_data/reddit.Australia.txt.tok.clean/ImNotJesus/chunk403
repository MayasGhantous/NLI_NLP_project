  he is a clear downgrade from varejao right now . 
  he has hakeem ceiling but this season that 's the case . 
  holy shitballs that would be a fun team to watch . 
  but look how many cannons i have ... he says as the tank approaches . 
  plus , look at all that sweet trading post income . 
  give me 20-30 turns and i can buy another elephant to * fuck you up * . 
  it 's so ... rapey though . 
  hypothetically , let 's say he 's actually right though and some people just add more financially to the society than others , ** so fucking what ** ? 
  let 's even ignore the fact that without social policies to help poorer people the richer would be worse off ( turns out that you want staff with basic medical care and living in houses ) or the fact that at some point in your , or your family 's history you 've gotten great value out of social welfare . 
  fine . 
  at the end of the day , you 're still only successful because of a laundry list of lucky occurrences . 
  i did n't choose to be born into a wealthy country . 
  i did n't choose to be born in a time where making a significant living is possible for most people . 
  i did n't choose to be born to parents that did n't abuse me . 
  i did n't choose to be born with the intelligence i have . 
  i did n't choose to be born without significant physical or mental impediment . 
  i did n't choose to never get hit by a car or get an infection that limited my brain function . 
  i am ** seriously fucking lucky ** to even have the opportunity to be wealthy one day so if i ever am , i 'll be the last person to try to fuck over the people that were n't as lucky . 
  this is nothing more than motivated social cognition - a just world belief that the rich deserve to be rich and the poor deserve to be poor because it makes you feel better about yourself . 
  it 's factually and ethically farcical and do n't hold up to 5 minutes of rational thinking but is one of the greatest obstacles in modern politics . 
  let 's be fair here . 
  he does n't think he 's doing a bad job . 
  he 's not trying to do damage , he 's just governed by a certain idea of the world that is wildly unfair and untrue . 
  he 's not a * bad * guy , just a sadly misguided one . 
  edit : explained further [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/28fc7r/government_given_double_dissolution_trigger_as/ciaejsq?context=2 ) ( it got a bit buried ) . 
  i assume you 're ( mostly ) kidding but he 's also not stupid . 
  in case anyone is wondering , there is a fair bit of research on this . 
  the most commonly accepted theory in psychology about political conservatism at the moment is called [ system justification theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system_justification ) . 
  while the work has its detractors , it basically states that people who are politically conservative are that way because of a felt sense of threat . 
  ** they respond to this threat by trying to maintain the status quo ** . 
  inherent in system justification are a combination of epistemic and existential motives :, 
  1 ) epistemic motives - people who are conservative are ( on average ) much less comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity . 
  this also relates to more mental rigidity ( rule-based thinking ) , closed-mindedness and ring-wing authoritarianism . 
  conversely , they tend to have a strong trust in authority and believe it to be much more important than liberal people . 
  2 ) existential motives - this relates to motives to see the world in a self-serving way . 
  for example , just-world beliefs for someone who is wealthy , allows them to believe that the rich * deserve * to be rich while the poor * deserve * to be poor . 
  please note that this is a ** very ** basic overview of an extremely complex topic . 
  [ here ] ( http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/jost.glaser.political-conservatism-as-motivated-social-cog.pdf ) is a link to the seminal paper on the topic ( cited almost 1500 times ) . 
  it 's extremely interesting if you 're interested in politics . 
  right , i 'm not disagreeing that he 's ignoring the needs and wants of his people , i 'm just saying that he ** thinks ** that he 's doing the right thing for australia .
