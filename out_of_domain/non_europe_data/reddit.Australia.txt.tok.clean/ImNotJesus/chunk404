  no , excellent observation , and that 's one of the major criticism 's of jost 's work , it essentially places the liberal perspective as the normative position . 
  i spend all day reading academic papers , it 's fun when i actually get to tell people about it . 
  my friends are so sick of me starting sentences with `` there 's actually a really cool paper ... '', 
  if you let me know what in particular you 're interested in , i 'd be happy to help . 
  also , it 's really hard to read most papers without academic access and a decent knowledge of the field . 
  there are a lot of terms in that paper with very specific meanings within the literature and assumed knowledge of the reader . 
  you can * certainly * get the gist of it but it 's hard work for someone who does n't read that specific subfield consistently . 
  the problem is that the vast majority of research of read by a very small number of people . 
  there 's no point writing it in laymens terms when only the handful of people who study the * exact same thing as you * are going to read it . 
  there 's no point defining terms that are assumed knowledge in the field . 
  very astute observation . 
  i ca n't think of any papers off the top of my head but i 'm sure the conservatism-empathy work has been done .

  absolutely but if i 'm reading a paper in personality and individual differences i really hope they 're not going to define personality in the first paragraph . 
  no you were n't . 
  you were banned for being a racist twat . 
  people genuinely asking questions do n't ask about `` dirty arabs '' .

  that 's a bingo . 
  honestly , i do n't like to say . 
  the number of people researching the same thing as me are pretty small so knowing that i 'm in australia and what i study , you could work out who i am pretty easily . 
  people who mod defaults have to be super paranoid about doxxing . 
  no reason to apologise at all . 
  it 's a totally understandable and friendly question , that 's why i wanted to explain instead of just ignoring you .

  1 ) we do n't want to just set a time and let the person know - part of the unbanning process involves us being sure that this was a one-time thing . 
  that conversation will go smoother if we can outlay certain information in the ban message before things get out of hand . 
  2 ) there 's nothing someone could do to abuse it that they could n't do in pm . 
  i do n't think mods will abuse it but almost any new feature you can think up , there 's a way for mods to abuse it . 
  there 's no reason to respond if a generic message says `` you will be unbanned in 48 hours '' . 
  as for remembering to unban them , we make them message us back after x time . 
  i understand that and always appreciate your opinion . 
  i just do n't think that people will bother changing a subreddit setting constantly just to annoy one user , especially because there 's a chance someone else will be banned at a similar time and get the same message . 
  also , it would be logged as edits to subreddit settings so other mods would be aware . 
  no way vonleh drops that . 
  most boards have him taken by utah or magic .

  i know some people are against this sort of thing but i actually think there should be default-only mod features for situations like this . 
  it 's not needed for a small subreddit and it 's how you get around all the abuse issues . 
  it 's the new part . 
  the paper is 2 years old . 
  i 'm sure i remember seeing it , which is why i checked the date . 
  the rule is 6 months . 
  all over a certain size - whatever . 
  the point is that there are features that would be useful for big subreddits that are n't implemented because people who moderate small subreddits ca n't be trusted - that 's dumb .

  you should try posting a paper that suggests that maybe chain smoking joints at 13 is bad . 
  you get downvoted faster than someone over the age of 12 on trp . 
  eh , to be fair , you 're picking on a post with very few comments/votes . 
  also , the top reply ( only thing with any votes ) is responded to by someone making your exact point and it has more upvotes . 
  i agree that this happens in / r/science but you 're cherry-picking pretty badly . 
  there are literally hundreds of flaired users with completed degrees and advanced degrees . 
  users have flair as well , the qualified ones do . 
  if you see bad comments , report them . 
  it 's a moderated sub . 
  the doctor also said that i need more friends ... please be friends with me .

  i had a teacher that gave me that same listen when i was 18 and in ultimate smug mode . 
  he literally would say things like `` ooo that 's a good word , i 'll try to use it in a conversation wih adults '' . 
  the thought of turning out like him scared me into wanting to actually achieve things , not just try to seem smart to people . 
  all while revolutionising their field and being on the forefront of changes that will greatly increase health and well-being of people for generations to come . 
  those monsters . 
   revolutionizing the use of monocrop agriculture does n't necessarily result in long-term health and well-being . 
  not necessarily no , i 'm adding in my own opinion there . 
  we have extremely significant food production issues that we 're going to have to start dealing with and gm researchers will soon be very relevant to the sociopolitical future of the world .
