  hi ikeepsithood , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ), 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone . 
  for personal matters , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/28jh8e/how_hard_is_it_to_move_to_a_european_country_from/ ) . 
  your friend needs professional help that ca n't be provided here . 
  i suggest calling a local helpline in your area for advice in how best to support him . 
  [ julian is currently doing an ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/28js8v/i_am_julian_assange_publisher_of_wikileaks_ask_me/?sort=new ), 
  there 's literally thousands by real researchers at universities who have nothing to do with monsanto or any company you dislike . 
  also , it becomes harder to scout when you need open borders to find everyone .

  are you getting brigaded fritzly ?

  i have absolutely no idea why the admins let that place stay open but whatever . 
  it seems insane to me . 
  russell westbrook .

  what can you learn about climate at high altitudes that you ca n't learn at sea level ? 
  why is it important to the overall picture ? 
  care about what music kids listen to . 
  all music that people listen to from 10-18 is terrible . 
  terrible . 
  seriously , i can clearly remember having a conversation with my dad where i was trying to convince him that hanson was the best band of all time and that i would never change my mind . 
  justin bieber is crap , so is , in all likelihood , the music you listened to growing up . 
  what 's in 2.2 ? 
  is it shiny ?
