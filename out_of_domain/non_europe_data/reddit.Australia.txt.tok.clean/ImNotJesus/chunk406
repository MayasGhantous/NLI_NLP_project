  it 's hilarious . 
  we 've been begging for this in / r/iama for ages . 
  i know this does n't help you directly but some unsolicited advice : it could be worth setting up automod to look for key words like `` eat '' and `` ingest '' and either report them or automatically remove them . 
  how about the stuff i forwarded from the monsanto/big pharma/nsa/israel requests ? 
  jesus 76ers would have a lot of talent if that 's how it goes . 
  vonleh at 10 and embiid at 3 would be an epic result . 
  if i were a 76ers fan , i would be * over the moon * . 
  i 'd watch a lot of games of an oladipo-exum backcourt . 
  you take the best players and trade if necessary . 
  show off vonleh all season and trade either him or noel for a wing player . 
  add that to a good pick in next year 's draft and they 're a serious team in a few years . 
  flair up, 
  always take the best players available , especially if you 're not trying to win now . 
  embiid is out most of the season . 
  or you show off vonleh 's talent for a year playing him big minutes in a high pace team and then trade him or noel at the end of the year for a wing . 
  it seems like philly are leaning towards embiid which means that his biggest fans ( magic ) will take exum instead .

  aaaaand scene . 
  since someone is going to eventually , it 's for ** r ** est. 
  at the risk of sounding biased , it 's definitely westbrook . 
  he 's a mildly better offensive player and ** significantly ** better defensive player . 
  the '' / r/atheism is a circlejerk '' circlejerk is significantly more obnoxious than / r/atheism itself ( which is saying something ) .

  thanks for doing this ama !, 
  a few questions because i 'm fascinated by the area :, 
  1 ) do you think that seeing a sports psychologist is something that all professional athletes would get benefit from or only when there is an issue limiting their performance ? 
  2 ) if you had one global tip for athletes what would it be ? 
  3 ) what proportion of what you do involves regular therapeutic tools adapted to sports scenarios ? 
  4 ) what resources would you recommend for getting started in the area ? 
  5 ) do you work with non-professional athletes much ? 
  if so , are they generally people working towards becoming professional or semi-professional athletes ?

  no rational person thinks that suicide is evil . 
  the reason we try to prevent suicide is that * if * someone is in such a dark place that they 're feeling suicidal , they 're so clearly distressed and/or mentally ill that they 're not capable of making a rational enough decision about something so irreversible . 
  you do n't stand on a ledge when you 're calm and emotionless . 
  it 's seriously insane to me that the naturopath is n't criminally liable for that . 
  for some bizarre reason , medicine seems to be one of the only places where you can pretend to have expertise and sell things that ** at best ** do n't work . 
  if i bought a couch that did n't perform its basic function ( holding my weight ) , i would be entitled to a refund . 
  if i go to a naturopath , they can literally make shit up and my legal recourse is almost none because they have a hugely powerful lobby . 
  people think `` big pharma '' are evil but they have ** nothing ** on the natural medicine industry . 
  while it obviously does n't replace vaccination , it * is * important to recognise that meditation comes under a very different category to crystals . 
  there is a wealth of scientific evidence to show that meditation is very good for your mental well-being . 
  i do n't think you read what i wrote .

  i do n't know if it 's random as much as anonymous but i volunteer on an crisis helpline . 
  it 's one of the most wonderfully rewarding and enriching experiences you can have, 
  i would give them a very brief rundown of the research showing that money spent helping other people has a greater impact on your happiness than spending the same amount of money on yourself .
