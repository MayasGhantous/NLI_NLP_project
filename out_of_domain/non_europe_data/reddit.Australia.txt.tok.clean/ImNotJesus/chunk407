  then i 'd flash my genitals . 
   i was under the impression that many naturopaths who are performing patient care are actually licensed physicians as well . 
  why would someone with scientific and medical training spend time , money and effort studying bullshit ?

  removal reasons with mod toolbox . 
  alternatively , you could have automod set up to search for something in square brackets if the original link comes from twitter . 
  tl ; dr : `` you motherfuckers are just numbers to me '', 
  there 's no way okc signs him for more than the vet minimum . 
  adams is already better than him . 
  i 'm a psychology researcher with plans to study to become a therapist after my social psychology phd . 
  i also volunteer as a crisis counsellor and earn money on the side by working as a research assistant for a professor at my university . 
  i get paid to learn about things i find fascinating and fucking love it . 
  just a reminder everyone : you always have to be aware of doxxing on reddit . 
  make sure you do n't give out any specific information about your career that could lead back to you . 
  edit : [ doxing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doxing ) - an abbreviation of document tracing , the internet-based practice of researching and publishing personally identifiable information about an individual . 
  mods ca n't verify if information is actually yours . 
  even if you say `` my name is john smith and my phone number is 555-example-555 '' , it ** could ** be true but how can we know ? 
  i love the research . 
  you spend all day reading about things you find fascinating and talking to people who find it equally cool . 
  research is easier to get into ( in australia where i 'm from ) than becoming a therapist or neuropsych but it may be different there . 
  sometimes you 'll hear stories that really hit you for a range of reasons and it can take a couple of days to shake it off . 
  you have to learn to be professional and not inject your own emotion into other people 's stories but at the same time you 're a terrible therapist if it never happens . 
  researchers make good money in australia but jobs after phd are hard to come by . 
  conversely , becoming a therapist is way harder but there 's tonnes of work once you graduate . 
  it 's totally separate . 
  i 'm doing the phd for `` fun '' . 
  i think act appeals to me most in terms of therapies . 
  if you want to be a researcher or a therapist , you basically have to do grad studies . 
  there are other options , like in australia you can basically do a 2 year internship after your honours degree ( an extra year after undergrad ) and be qualified . 
  for fun . 
  i know it 's less relevant for practice later on . 
  reach out to potential supervisors * now * . 
  i had known my supervisor for 2 years before applying for my phd . 
  try phone counselling . 
  revealing people 's personal informatino . 
  ethically disgusting . 
  there was no informed consent and no debriefing . 
  insanely competitive . 
  i 'd prefer not to say what i study for privacy reasons but yes the money is decent . 
  do a phd !, 
  they 're fun . 
  i study full-time so i flick between reddit and studying constantly . 
  yeah , with research you can either stay at a university and slowly work your way up , work for research companies or both . 
  ask them if you can volunteer on any of their projects or if they have journal meetings you can attend . 
  i applied a few years ago when askreddit needed people . 
  there are n't any . 
  just listen and ask questions . 
  social is n't for everyone . 
  mostly the group behaviour is terrible and i 'm always going to remember the outliers ( i.e. , the shitty people ) so do n't judge all of humanity when i see terrible things . 
  i did a psych major - you need to in australia to do it in post-grad . 
  day to day , i read papers and work on projects , mostly in my underwear while on reddit, 
  i live in australia so it 's probably different , just have a word to your university/college . 
  there 's a lot of overlap between econ and psych ( obviously behavioural econ more than macro ) and diverse experience is a plus . 
  it makes me more effective in my life in general . 
  that 's also as a result of receiving therapy for a long time . 
  long-term i 'm more interested in practicing but i wanted to do a phd for fun . 
  the more important thing is to find the area you 're interested in and start making contact with the supervisors . 
  i found my area first and got my supervisor on board with a broad project . 
  we 're narrowing it down over time organically . 
  i work weekends and do ra work . 
  hoping to get a scholarship . 
  have only just started the phd . 
  i 'd prefer not to say for doxing reasons . 
  it was a rule on reddit for ** years ** before him . 
  yeah , turns out that someone having their life ruined wakes you up to the dangers . 
  also , it most certainly was . 
  seriously though , someone who likes it and cares about people . 
  i 've just started and the guy i 'm working for is great . 
  it helps that i work weekends in a call centre so by comparison anything is good . 
  make sure to [ message the admins about it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ), 
  yes . 
  source : i work in a call centre on the weekends . 
  seek out supervisors * now * . 
  see if you can volunteer for them . 
  you want to be a known entity . 
  i do most of my work at home and in front of my computer . 
  if i 'm on reddit , i 'm not working efficiently . 
  research is very different because at the moment i 'm mostly just in front of my computer reading . 
  we may have missed our window . 
  windows do n't tend to stay open very long . 
  something happens eventually . 
  masters teaches you to practice . 
  phd is for research . 
  med school is to be a psych ** iatrist ** . 
  there 's normally an approved psych pathway . 
  check with the school . 
  getting a job is easy for a therapist , hard for a researcher . 
  yes but important . 
  depends the sort of job and how well you do along the way . 
  i do n't think so .
