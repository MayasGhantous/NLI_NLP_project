  you 're the outlier though , the exception . 
  thunder were # 5 in defensive efficiency and # 7 in offensive despite missing their second best player ( who is also the pg ) basically all season . 
  all that with an owner who refuses to spend money on depth and had to play derek fisher 's corpse . 
  i think he did a great job with the pieces he had . 
  you generally work in a pretty specific area but then also collaborate with others . 
  some people work broadly , others not as much . 
  you 're always reading though . 
  clinical masters . 
  the phd really wo n't help me practice significantly , it 's just for fun . 
  i do n't !, 
  the phd was for fun . 
  dumb grudges mostly . 
  masters teaches you how to be a therapist . 
  phd is research . 
  psyd is a combo ( you do some research in masters but not as much ) . 
  not really . 
  i 'll most likely work in private practice . 
  you 'll be everyone 's best friend if you 've got a good stats background . 
  learning to use complex programs/analyses is a great way to get your name on a lot of papers . 
  heard about it from people talking , sent the professor an e-mail . 
  i 'm in australia, 
  it can be hard to get good , valid experience because of ethical issues with untrained therapists . 
  i got really good experience from doing phone counselling but it 's limited in scope . 
  depending on what you want to do and what country you 're from , you may * have * to do a masters to practice . 
  i 'm finding it more upsetting that he did n't settle his city one square higher for ocean access and being next to a mountain . 
  some clinicians do both . 
  i 'm doing social research so it 's not really related to practising . 
  masters is ultra competitive and only getting worse . 
  you 'll get there , keep your chin up and work your ass off finding opportunities . 
  receiving therapy and it changing my life . 
  work out what you want to do early and spend as much spare time as you can getting experience . 
  you really could n't though . 
  the number did n't mean anything , it was n't accurate for anything with more than a few votes and even then it was n't always accurate . 
  back in my day askreddit `` questions '' contained an entire story in the title . 
  never listened to instructions . 
  ever . 
  full masters course . 
  there 's little overlap . 
  it 's a fair bit but it 's functional . 
  you do n't need to know how analyses work as much as what they do and when to use them . 
  i wonder what his hospital gown looked like . 
  voting is still obscured by fuzzing . 
  it stops bots and people voting on multiple accounts . 
  mitch leaned forward a little bit but when melo did n't respond he tried to casually pretend he was n't .

  30th in defensive efficiency, 
  what ? 
  you posted a phone number several times and then asked dozens of people to spam our modmail . 
  we unbanned you and you ** still ** posted the phone number again . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  i 'm not mad , i just found your response hilarious . 
  yeah , i get it , people go through tough times and adjusting to new meds can be difficult but i 'm not sure you quite understand the shitstorm you unleashed on modmail . 
  we * really * tried to work with you too but at the end of the day we can only give so many chances . 
  we have no way of knowing what your previous account is so i 'm not sure why you think that . 
  glad to hear there are no hard feelings . 
  proof ? 
  yeah but with negative athleticism , guys who ca n't play 40 minutes and no depth . 
  big men are expensive . 
  he currently plays in miami . 
  the cap will go up when profits do ( next tv deal ) . 
  there will be a big jump in a couple of years .

  i genuinely believe he thinks that he is doing the right thing . 
  he 's just doing a terrible job of it . 
  what a brilliant question . 
  i ** hate ** deepak chopra and other pseudoscience pushers . 
  at the end of the day though , i do genuinely believe that most people in pseudoscience genuinely believe and care , they 're just too caught up in their own ideology to see that they 're wrong . 
  i respect that they want to help people , i just wish they 'd go about it in a better way . 
  stealing a comment i made from an / r/australia post a while ago :, 
  at the end of the day , he is running the country in a way that fits with his ideology . 
  it 's one that skews the way he sees the world ( like all ideologies ) but it 's consistent with what he believes as a conservative . 
  there is a fair bit of research on political conservatism . 
  the most commonly accepted theory in psychology about political conservatism at the moment is called [ system justification theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system_justification ) . 
  while the work has its detractors , it basically states that people who are politically conservative are that way because of a felt sense of threat . 
  ** they respond to this threat by trying to maintain the status quo ** . 
  inherent in system justification are a combination of epistemic and existential motives :, 
  1 ) epistemic motives - people who are conservative are ( on average ) much less comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity . 
  this also relates to more mental rigidity ( rule-based thinking ) , closed-mindedness and ring-wing authoritarianism . 
  conversely , they tend to have a strong trust in authority and believe it to be much more important than liberal people . 
  2 ) existential motives - this relates to motives to see the world in a self-serving way . 
  for example , just-world beliefs for someone who is wealthy , allows them to believe that the rich * deserve * to be rich while the poor * deserve * to be poor . 
  please note that this is a ** very ** basic overview of an extremely complex topic . 
  [ here ] ( http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/jost.glaser.political-conservatism-as-motivated-social-cog.pdf ) is a link to the seminal paper on the topic ( cited almost 1500 times ) . 
  it 's extremely interesting if you 're interested in politics . 
  in that alternate universe did grant hill also have someone else 's body ?
