  they were a really good offensive team and okay defensive team that played up-tempo . 
  they ran into some really good spurs/mavs/lakers teams and had an owner that did n't spend money and demanded panic trades . 
  swung for the fences a few times and eventually their window closed when stod could n't stay fit . 
  all up a very good team that were super competitive for years and fun as hell to watch .

  it never really worked . 
  the suns were known for their high pace play and shaq wanted to spend 15 seconds backing down in the post each play . 
  most teams just exploited him by running the guy he was defending in pick and rolls . 
  shaq was really slow by then . 
  your assumption is completely wrong . 
  it 's not because it hurts the people around you . 
  the reason behind the law is that anyone so distressed that they are considering suicide is clearly not capable of making a decision that drastic . 
  the law is n't in place to punish people who try , it 's to give law enforcement and relevant bodies the ability to step in when people are n't capable of taking care of themselves .

  meditation !, 
  it 's one of those takes a moment to learn and a lifetime to master things but if you want something with an extremely large amount of peer-reviewed data supporting its efficaciousness , try meditation . 
  mindfulness meditation ( and related therapies ) [ is one of the most studied topics in the last 15 years in psychology and neuroscience ] ( http://marc.ucla.edu/workfiles/pdfs/marc_mindfulness_biblio_0609.pdf ) .

  itt people thinking that scott brooks is bad coach . 
  fun fact , despite missing russ almost all season and having no bench , the thunder were the # 7 offensive team last season and # 5 defensive team . 
  seriously , how are you actually supposed to coach a flowing offence when you 're hamstrung into playing three point guards ( including derek fucking fisher ) or having 3 guys on the court who ca n't make a shot at all times . 
  nba defences are really , really good and while brooks can and will improve , blaming him for not having a beautiful spurs-type offence is ridiculous ** with the personnel he had ** . 
  i get that it 's fun to circlejerk but besides being less of an offensive co-ordinator than he could be , the guy gets results . 
  is it necessarily brooks fault though ? 
  ibaka can * only * pick and pop and kd does n't work hard without the ball . 
  also , the reason that the spurs offence is ( mildly ) better is that they have 5 guys on the court who can pass or shoot at all times . 
  you just do n't get the same offensive flow when you do n't need to guard 2 guys on the floor because it destroys your spacing and makes you more predictable . 
  sure pick and roll after pick and roll is n't very inventive but you 've got to work with the tools you have .

  to be fair , the headline was wildly ambiguous and it 's not a unreasonable conclusion . 
  why would i let logic and reason get in the way of my angry gut opinion . 
  i 've heard this suggested before and it would be wildly useful . 
  got pulled out by a bad rip while swimming at a pretty secluded beach . 
  struggled against the waves for a while before swimming diagonally enough to get out . 
  had a panic attack , swallowed a bunch of water and was pretty convinced i was going to die . 
  i 've had panic attacks before . 
  the way to get out of them is to relax your body by focusing on your breath . 
  turns out that you ca n't do that when feeling like if you stop struggling for a moment you 'll die .

  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities .
