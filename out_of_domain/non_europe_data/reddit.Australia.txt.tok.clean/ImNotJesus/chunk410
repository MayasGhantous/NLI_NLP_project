  you also need to deal with the grief and go through it at your own pace . 
  you can be kind and loving but you ca n't fix it . 
  it is and i 'm sorry that you have to go through two terrible experiences - losing someone you love and having to watch your parents go through immense grief . 
  while every part of you wants to make your pain and their pain simply go away , that is n't on the table right now . 
  be kind and caring towards your parents but do n't try to make it go away . 
  psychology - almost everything . 
  most outrageous though ? 
  i 've had people genuinely ask me if it means that i can read their mind . 
  went on a `` job interview '' for a sports marketing company . 
  did n't realise until after i got home that it was a pyramid scheme . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the asterisk shows up if the comment is edited after 3 minutes or after 1 minute if there is a reply . 
  proof ? 
  i had a terrible case of thabo for years, 
  it must be hard for heat fans not knowing which team to support yet . 
  wiggins is talented but not a winner . 
  how will that affect his legacy ? 
  [ amico ] according to sources , i 'm 20 minutes behind everything,

  shit guys , someone on a forum said it . 
  it 's basically a done deal . 
  right . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's impossible , just that you ca n't possibly sort the credible from the incredible .

  3 days * from the 10th * . 
  the clock does n't even start yet . 
  still it 's a good move by mavs because it puts the pressure on signing bosh asap . 
  not until you match or do n't . 
  which is 3 days and it only starts on the 10th . 
  basically , you 've got 4 days to sign bosh . 
  morey just took out his balls and placed them on the table . 
  you 're ** insane ** then . 
  love is a top 10 player in the league and he 's 25 . 
  wiggins does n't help you now . 
  with what money to sign him ? 
  itt : insane cavs fans, 
  if you can trade an uproven player for a 25 year old top 10 player , you do it 11 times out of 10 . 
  exactly . 
  he has n't said a word to anyone and is just going about his business . 
  good on him . 
  if i was making a massive decision that affected not just the next few years of my life but huge amounts of money and my legacy , i 'd want to take my time as well . 
  for anyone interested , [ here is a picture of morey and the rest of the front office heading off to make the offer ] ( http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltrk7rwmwk1qhltmdo1_500.jpg ) . 
  shh it 's funnier the other way .

  do mavs actually want him ? 
  it 's a lot of money for parsons . 
  pierece was n't a top 10 player then . 
  they also did n't have the # 1 player in the league probably about to sign and an all-star pg . 
  that team is ready to compete for a championship , getting pierce in 2003 would n't have had anywhere near the same impact .
