  love is leaving the wolves because he wants to win . 
  sure they do . 
  they can get pieces from other teams . 
  also , they 're not on a clock , cavs are . 
  wow some of these are great . 
  thanks deimorz . 
  wade wants to win more than he wants to get paid , that 's why he opted out . 
  in the same way , he ca n't sign them to a 12 million dollar contract and then buy them a house as a present . 
   from a mods perspective i can see why you are trying this ; however from a users perspective it takes away usability that should be under my control and makes following a thread very difficult . 
  just to be clear . 
  we have n't tried anything , we were just discussing it in modmail as an interesting thought experiment and wanted some outside opinions . 
  no momentum means that your post does n't sit at the top and it wo n't be the most seen . 
  not necessarily trying to , just wondering if reducing the ability to * get * karma curbs the rate at which people present low-effort content or mass-appealing comments just to try and get it . 
  no benefit in telling them earlier . 
  people that make music for other demographics . 
  seriously , bieber is literally worse than hitler for making music that does n't appeal to me personally . 
  for fun , i looked up the closest charts to [ 40 years ago today . 
  ] ( http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1974-07-13/ ), 
  [ number 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kl6u6ribpo&amp;feature=kp ), 
  [ number 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aom4dw5l5qq&amp;feature=kp ), 
  [ number 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5emuyyfxhty&amp;feature=kp ), 
  [ number 4 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxhw1rgddo&amp;feature=kp ), 
  [ number 5 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbp6rpdg7qu&amp;feature=kp ), 
  it 's mostly garbage although number 2 is pretty catchy . 
  i would not like to run into a baynes pick . 
  i think he would absolutely thrive either playing for the spurs or thunder . 
  spurs getting him terrifies me . 
  this might be a dumb question but can you use any wood you chop off a tree in your backyard or should you only use wood you know is used for smoking .

   we deserve transparency . 
  this is n't congress . 
  the mods of a particular sub do n't owe you anything . 
  in fact , the admins consistently reinforce that moderators are the people in full control of individual subreddits ( assuming you 're not breaking reddit 's main 5 rules ) . 
  moderation logs are n't public because there is no reason for it to be . 
  it also reduces witch hunting . 
  additionally , most moderator groups work as a * team * . 
  the actions of one represents the actions of the group . 
  allowing the modlog to be public would encourage users to pm individual mods instead of the group as a whole . 
  why ? 
  what do you think it will achieve ? 
  oh shit i did n't even think of that . 
  that 's the absolute , knock down , best reason against it . 
  lucky that they were n't talking about anyone named clint . 
  i did n't see his last comment but i 'm assuming thing applies - [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  just remember people - fake names at all times . 
  we have zero tolerance on people posting personal information and full names qualify . 
   i 'm probably the first guy on this sub to harp against more mods powers and privileges, 
  so you 're probably against almost all of my ideas . 
  i know that when i make giant decisions that affect my and my family 's future i make them as quickly as possible just to keep random people i do n't know on the internet happy .

  he drops a fucking eurostep at full speed . 
  very few 7 footers have ever been able to move like that , let alone 16 year olds . 
  i could watch # 8 for days . 
  they played a high tempo pace last season , he 'll get all the minutes and touches he wants , there 's no pressure to win and he can contribute on both ends . 
  it 's a perfect roy situation . 
  i think what happens to rondo will have a big impact . 
  no problems pal . 
  also , always take a picture of the car/driver number . 
  it 's the best way to find that shit you drunkenly left in the car . 
  if you call up the next day and say that you got picked up from [ x popular drinking area in your city ] at a busy time most taxi companies will politely tell you to go fuck yourself because it will take forever to work out which cab you were in .

  bennett and antetokoumpo too hopefully !, 
  notice how his head goes back and to the left . 
  back ... and to the left ... 
  as a professional body language interpreter . 
  i can tell you with absolute certainty that these two people are having a conversation where words are being exchanged .
