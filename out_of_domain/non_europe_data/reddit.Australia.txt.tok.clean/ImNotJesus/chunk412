  hello evce1 . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  being in a real relationship is about caring about your partner more than you care about winning or losing a fight .

  i might be biased as an australian but i feel like in 5 years we 'll be saying exum was the superstar of the group . 
  i really think that the mavs paid way too much for an average sf . 
  edit : kd , lebron , melo , george , kawhi , batum , deng , igoudala , hayward are all clearly ahead of him in my mind . 
  that makes him 10 at best . 
  average may be a tad strong but he 's certainly not an elite sf and that was a huge overpay . 
  if you 're paying 15m for a guy who 's the 10th best at their position , you 're in trouble . 
  oh this one drives me insane . 
  i bring my ipad to work and at lunch i have both headphones in watching a show . 
  you can talk to me ** all day ** but choose when i have both headphones in to inanely me ask me `` how 's it going ? '', 
  this is especially true in relationships . 
  sometimes being kind is much more important that being right . 
  ** the opportunities you have in life are largely due to an incalculable number of random occurrences that you did n't choose . 
  ** you do n't * deserve * anything , you 're insanely lucky to live in ( objectively ) the best world that has ever existed and if you 're reading this , you 've probably got it pretty good compared to a huge percentage of the world . 
  never forget that when deciding what other people deserve who were n't lucky enough to have the same opportunities as you . 
  studies show that spending money on other people gives a greater net gain to happiness than spending the same amount of money on yourself . 
  all amas require proof .
