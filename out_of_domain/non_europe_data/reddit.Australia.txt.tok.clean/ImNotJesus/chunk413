  i 'm the best as being modest . 
  1 in 1 out, 
  i literally got denied youth allowance for earning too much ** and ** not earning enough at the same time . 
  i had n't earned enough to be independent but because there was a trust in my name i also had too much taxable income even though i did n't see a cent of the trust . 
  i never said it was anyone 's fault , i just thought it was funny . 
  we ask that you do n't make a post more than 30 minutes before being ready to answer . 
  please feel free to make a new post , with proof , when he 's ready . 
  we had shit seats and spent as much time watching the monitor as the cage and had a blast . 
  you do n't go for the view , you go for the atmosphere . 
  that 's a serious steal . 
  gooden has game and could be a real bonus for a playoff team . 
  also , amas are creating new content specifically for reddit . 
  they 're not spamming links to their album for sales , they 're engaging with a community that wants to engage with them in exchange for a platform to tell people interested in them about their recent projects . 
  the difference is that they 're creating content for reddit . 
  they 're not spamming links to their album for sales , they 're engaging with a community that wants to engage with them in exchange for a platform to tell people interested in them about their recent projects . 
  i also get annoyed when people have different tastes to me .

  i think it depends on whether it 's honest or not . 
  if they presenting themselves as taco bell making content for reddit and it 's not being manipulated in any way ( votes , astroturfing etc. ), 
  it 's fine . 
  the problem with spam is when it 's manipulative , hidden or does n't add anything of value . 
  if the ads are genuinely entertaining enough to get upvotes then it 's fine . 
  have n't done it yet but in a few hours i 'm going to spend 5 hours volunteering at a crisis helpline . 
  so what 's the answer then ? 
  no one can mention any content that could conceivably make anyone money ? 
  thanks . 
  i get a lot out of it as well but no one should have to go through their darkest moment alone , especially when talking to someone could change their life or even cause them to keep living . 
  i could n't agree more that this is the perfect situation for wiggins to become a star . 
  he 's not ready to walk onto a milwaukee team and score 20ppg . 
  if he tried , it would probably stunt his growth . 
  instead , he will have the same opportunity kawhi did - become a 3 & d guy while learning from an incredible coach and one of the game 's greatest ever players . 
  if wiggins has the maturity to do that ( and i think he does ) , he will be a monster in a few years . 
  that being said , i think that if you can trade an unknown entity for a top 10 player in the league when you 're in a position to win now , you do it . 
  windows snap shut all the time and it 's not always obvious when it will happen . 
  lebron could have 2 knee surgeries in 2016 and never be the same again . 
  who knows ? 
  if you 've got the best player in the world and the ability to bring in another top 10 guy , you do it ** straight away ** . 
  that 's clearly a picture of jimmer,

  i will gladly watch as many utah and philly games as i can this year . 
  love watching the young guys learn to play . 
  most of our brain is n't for thinking . 
  the idea that you would want your entire temporal lobe ( that mostly deals with hearing and memories ) to active at the same time is bizarre . 
  also , using too much of your brain does exist , it 's called a seizure . 
  that everything always has to be perfect by the time the episode ends . 
  no one ever changes or grows , they just make some easily fixable mistake that they apologise for after 22 minutes and everything is fine again . 
  their avoidance of , and making fun of that trope is one of the reasons i fell in love with scrubs . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental .

  the percentages of people who suffer from mental illness or are considering suicide are simply staggering . 
  i think that future generations will look back on the way we treat the mentally ill in the same way that we look back in shame at the racism of previous generations . 
  we are so behind our knowledge of the topic . 
  why not both ? 
  the data says that a combination is by far the most efficacious . 
  i know this is the circlejerky answer but it has to be science . 
  a better understanding of our world would drastically improve the quality of life for this generation and many to come . 
  exactly . 
  the `` they 're all bad '' mentality is such a cop-out .

  you 're making some massive and fallacious assumptions there . 
  also , just because something has had an evolutionary impact in the past , that does n't mean it 's right to not act . 
  illness has historically kept population numbers lower but that does n't mean that we should withhold penicillin . 
  god knows how we 're going to explain this to our kids . 
  how embarrassing . 
  we 're going to look back on this with the same shame as when we wonder how previous generations could be so ignorant about racism . 
  a dark day in australian history . 
  frontal lobe does a lot of thinking , temporal lobe does n't . 
  that 's why i picked it .

  efficacious is the correct term . 
  they are tests of efficacy .

  i do love that the greens have realised that they can be the irreverent ` voice of the youth ' . 
  i like that they 've developed a bit of an attitude . 
  if i have a moment to myself i take a few deep breaths and concentrate on the sensation of the breath going in and out . 
  if i 'm in a situation where i 'm forced to continue doing what i 'm doing i just plough through and try to remind myself that people are way too self-absorbed to notice me . 
  that doing things to make you and/or your partner happy are much more important than being right . 
  wiggins . 
  he 's not the most nba ready but elite athleticism and good defence is huge in a 1v1, 
  by all objective measures we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  no one has ever lived in a time with lower rates of violence , better education , better medicine , more equal right etc. 
  can you please be more specific ?
