  thanks, 
  that 's a fantastic one . 
  i 'll add that now . 
  oh good , getting russia angry has never had negative consequences . 
  it 's a picture of 2 dozen people . 
  way to tarnish an entire country . 
  my point remains . 
  you 're implying that they 're wrong . 
  you ca n't base that on a few people . 
  man , i 'm not going to argue with you that no politician has ever made a hyperbolic statement . 
  i do n't know what random ass quote you 're going to pull out of nowhere . 
  at the end of the day , seeing 2 dozen idiots should n't change your opinion of an entire nation . 
  end of story . 
   i find it amusing how you 're totally cool with palestinians constantly being portrayed negatively in the media but as soon as israelis are you go into hysterics . 
  i literally have n't even typed the word palestinian yet . 
  you 're just making shit up at this point . 
  i commented on a specific part of your comment . 
  i said it was silly to generalise to an entire nation based on 2 dozen people . 
  that 's all . 
  stop making shit up . 
  that 's the overall aim but which parts of the scientific method do you think require a specific discussion ? 
  to different subreddits ... 
  i do n't understand what the issue is . 
  i 'm just trying to give content to people who would find it interesting . 
  i really do n't care about karma and it 's two separate subreddits . 
  what are you actually accusing me of ? 
  there 's actually been a lot of research on that second claim recently and it 's not as simple as that . 
  ara norenzayan ( perhaps the most respected reearcher in this area ) recently released a review on [ this topic ] ( http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/manuscripts/norenzayan_behaviour_doesreligionmakepeoplemoral.pdf ) ( free pdf through his website ) . 
  are you saying that you do n't think countercurrentnews.com is a bulletproof source ? 
  how dare you ? 
  i 've already got p-values on there but the other two are excellent suggestions . 
  the account that made the / r/music post has been shadowbanned . 
  i was just handed down a weber kettle and i 'm excited to get going but it was sitting dormant for a long time and needs a really good clean . 
  any advice ? 
  how do you feel about pellets ? 
  do n't assume that whoever you 're talking to represents a significant proportion of society - good or bad . 
  that despite seeing so many horrible things on tv we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  at no time in human history have there been lower rates of violent death , better education , healthcare , equal rights and a range of other wonderful things . 
  the world is getting better , be positive about keep trying to improve things . 
  grammar : the difference between helping your uncle jack off a horse and helping your uncle jack off a horse . 
  i think it 's hard to explain to people because it 's like experiencing something they feel regularly , just more intensely and almost all the time . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ) - i hate it when people say that free speech means they can say anything they want anytime they want with impunity . 
  it 's objectively true though . 
  historically , an average of 15 % of all people died from human on human violence . 
  in the 20th century , despite two world wars , much better weapons and greatly increased life expectancies , only 3 % died from human violence . 
  it 's gruesome that we see it and it 's plastered all over the news but this is only so outrageous because it 's more and more rare .

  it 's by steven pinker , a harvard psychologist . 
  wait , so i should n't be violently angry that pop stars make music for a different demographic ? 
  studies show that spending money on someone else gives a greater net gain to your subjective sense of well-being than spending an equal amount on yourself . 
  you , like everyone else in the world , have cognitive biases that make it hard for you to see when you 're wrong . 
  always question what you think you believe , think and feel . 
  my reddit username obviously . 
  because it 's lots or not many ? 
  as firedrops said we 're working on something like that . 
  the problem is journal access . 
  selling alternative medicine . 
  how it 's legal to sell fake medicine to people as it is is fucking beyond me .

  so you think the answer is to guess what works and give it to sick people ? 
  why the fuck do the admins let that place stay open ? 
  it 's so clearly against the spirit , if not the letter of the tos .
