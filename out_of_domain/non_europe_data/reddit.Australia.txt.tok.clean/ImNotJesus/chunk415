  verified, 
  there 's literally a genocide every time you scratch your nose then . 
  might want to qualify it futher, 
  bots are n't allowed on askreddit . 
  that 's why i 'm waiting for white people to leave australia any day now or is there some time limit that makes it okay ? 
  have you tried just [ not having cancer ] ( http://halfwaybetweenthegutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/36574_3621140803626_1127104452_33236535_1964638207_n.jpg ) ? 
  yeah , i 'm supposed to hate ( arbitrarily chosen team ) and enjoy them losing . 
  i do n't want them to be human beings with feelings and shit , now i feel bad .

  hi cnd-icehole , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 3 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3 - ) : askreddit is for open-ended , discussion questions . 
  questions with a single correct answer are not appropriate , and for those , try / r/answers . 
  yes/no , either/or , [ ` does anybody else ' ] ( / r/doesanybodyelse ) , [ would-you-rather ] ( / r/wouldyourather ) , [ poll-type questions ] ( / r/pollquestions ) , or [ surveys ] ( / r/samplesize ) are not conducive to community discussion .

  exactly . 
  i 'm not going to circumcise my son but whether to do it or not is a valid question . 
  it does n't change sexual pleasure ( according to recent studies ) and can prevent illness - there are benefits . 
  female genital mutilation is * purely * a disgusting act designed to make sex unpleasant for women . 
  you 're welcome to make a new post that follows the rules . 
  be careful about mentioning gilding though , if it appears like you 're offering gold in exchange for upvotes , you 'll end up getting shadowbanned by the admins ( happened just yesterday ) . 
  that makes a lot of sense . 
  great idea . 
  i do n't really understand the bashing either . 
  simmons is the first to tell you that he 's an entertainment guy . 
  he gives opinions , tells jokes and talks about ridiculous scenarios . 
  putting him in the same category as * reporters * who get things wrong is like complaining that jon stewart does n't talk about the news enough . 
  hi wantingtobefree , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ), 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone . 
  for personal matters , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self .

  charming . 
  yeah , changing leaders has done wonders for labor 's popularity in recent years . 
  it is a tacit endorsement of them and adds to their legitimacy . 
  imagine if he spoke at a white supremacist rally - people would be outraged because it would be a tacit endorsement of their racist views . 
  the acl , while obviously not a white supremacist rally , have extremely strong views and seek to deny rights to a large section of the australian population . 
  a potential future pm supporting them by speaking at their conference is a huge slap in the face . 
  awesome !, 
  you should apply for flair .

  thanks for doing an ama dr accili . 
  whenever we hear about amazing new discoveries in medicine , it feels like they rarely turn into a product/treatment used by the general public . 
  could you please give us an idea of the process of going from a finding like yours to actually being a viable and regularly used treatment option ? 
  [ australia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wgvgfjnlqc ) . 
  it was top of the charts a couple of years ago . 
  which numbers do you want to know ? 
  i can give you number of clicks of anything on the sidebar since april . 
  http://goo.gl/2dnqoj ( 166,318 ) and http://goo.gl/n67dsv ( 114,216 ) have the most by far . 
  the rest are mostly in the 10,000 to 20,000 range with a few over 30,000 . 
  i think it would have to be limited to top level replies because responses to the stories would n't need to be 500 words . 
  nice !, 
  you 're way ahead of me . 
  my automod knowledge involves going into modmail and saying `` can someone smarter than me please do x '' .

  be careful using the word debunks in that context , it implies certain things about the first study.also , remember that science works in confidence intervals , not certainties . 
  my favourite example to show people this is asking them the following . 
  `` do you think there are more words with ` r ' as the first letter or third letter . '', 
  most will guess first since it 's easier to think of examples but ` r ' as the third letter is ** far ** more common . 
   i think we anchor to the situations when we can remember them occurring and are generally blind to the reality of the statistical distribution ( s ), 
  that 's a representativeness heuristic . 
  i was given an amazing opportunity in high school where i got to be placed in a large company for a week with 4 other guys . 
  we were given training and a project to work on and we presented to a boardroom full of managers at the end of the week . 
  instead of trying to get the best out of the opportunity , i used the week in a dick measuring contest with a good friend of mine because we were both trying ( unconsciously ) to prove we were smarter than each other . 
  i ended up being totally dominating and acted like an ass to the other 3 guys . 
  did n't realise until the last day when one of the other 3 guys told me . 
  hit me like a tonne of bricks . 
  that no matter how many injuries you inflict it does n't reverse brain damage . 
  hello peter_griffin_iii . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  par for the fucking course . 
  that would be a great way to get banned from / r/iama . 
  just because you do n't like them , it does n't mean that [ the rules do n't apply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/wiki/index#wiki_15._what_is_.2fr.2fiama.27s_policy_on_comment_removals.3f ) . 
  michael was the obvious one for me too . 
  imagine his twitter posts after a frustrating loss . 
  bloody asylum seekers , always causing trouble . 
  if you want to discuss subreddit-wide issues , it 's best to send a message to the moderators and not bring it up here . 
  hello ironman_xv !, 
  i 've removed your request from iama . 
  we ask that when requesting public figures , users include some public way of contacting the person requested .
