  voting libertarian is great if you 're an upper middle class white guy who took an economics course in first year uni . 
  supporting a system where anyone without adequate opportunity gets fucked over generally correlates with being part of a privileged group .

  sorry but we try not to make a practice of applying the rules unevenly . 
  we do n't want to be making judgements about where the rules do or do n't apply , even if that leads to a mildly unpopular decision from time to time .

  do n't get sucked into complaining constantly even if your co-workers do it . 
  negativity breeds negativity and it will only make your life worse . 
  also , even if your job is terrible , learn to take pride in being good at something for the sake of being good at something . 
  i hate my job and ca n't wait until i can quit but i 've been promoted twice in the last year because no matter how shitty i feel , i always want to be the best at everything .

  why not just accept all people the way they are if they 're not hurting other people . 
  acceptance does n't mean you think they 're doing the right thing , it means you agree that it 's none of your fucking business . 
  i know right , do n't you hate it when marginalised groups try to represent themselves in a meaningful way . 
  they should just simplify their own sexuality for the sake of it being an easier acronym for me . 
  exactly . 
  we 've fixed equal rights , just like racism . 
   my problem is n't the acronym . 
  i just think all these new identities are n't necessary .
