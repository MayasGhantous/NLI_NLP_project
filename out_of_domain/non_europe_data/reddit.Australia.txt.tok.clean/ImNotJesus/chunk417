  to ** you ** . 
  obviously it 's meaningful to them . 
   all these new groups are just creating division after division , which is n't entirely necessary . 
  to ** you ** . 
  reddit so regularly reminds me of [ this xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/atheists.png ) . 
  it does n't matter what the topic is , redditors will find a way to project their impotent rage into being superior to any and all groups . 
  anything is less insufferable than the dae hate women who friendzone circlejerk . 
  seriously , being traded for a top 10 player in the world is n't disrespectful . 
  the cavs clearly value him but windows only stay open for so long , he must understand that . 
  in 4 years he 'll probably be a better player . 
  lebron will be 33 then . 
  marion is n't the defender he once was . 
  varejao is a lock to miss 20 + games and do you really want tt playing in crunch time ? 
  considering how widely successful einstein 's theory has been in standing up to test after test after test , it 's very likely that tesla was simply wrong . 
  that 's no knock on tesla , it 's just that relativity has been an immensely resilient theory . 
  he was undoubtedly brilliant . 
  that does n't mean that he was right about everything .

  there 's an important heuristic ( a heuristic is a mental shortcut we naturally use to understand the world ) in psychology referred to as [ ** anchoring and adjustment ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anchoring#anchoring-and-adjusting ) . 
  essentially , what this means is that we * estimate * the value of things by using cues we see , even if we know those estimates are wrong . 
  this is why sales are so effective . 
  we 've seen an estimated value of x and now we can have x-y , it * must * be a bargain . 
  for all you know paul is begging him to take the offer and bledsoe is the one with the unrealistic expectations . 
  if i 'm an agent , i 'm trying to get my injury prone player who relies on his athleticism to take big long term money . 
  thank you for your articulate and well thought out response . 
  i look forward to all the downvotes i receive for trying to say that maybe we should slow the circlejerk for a fraction of a second . 
  thanks pal , that means a lot . 
  as mods we hear almost exclusively from people who are unhappy so kind words mean more than you think . 
  definitely worth looking at other tag ideas but we ca n't combine them as currently structured . 
  we 've thought about trying a couple of regular features like that . 
  for example , if we did a mod run job fair post every so often ( but run in contest mode so all jobs get seen ) . 
  would yo enjoy something like that ? 
  if you sticky it too soon it does n't cycle through / new and all/top/hourly . 
  it will be stickier later . 
  lost cause . 
  it really varies . 
  sometimes they have unrealistic expectations of the process or only planned to be there for ~ 30 minutes . 
  in other cases people do n't like the questions and do n't feel like answering them , which is their right . 
  on amas though , you pay a price for not answering questions and it generally looks bad . 
  i ca n't think of any cases off the top of my head where someone doing an ama has really gotten angry at us in modmail about how one went - we generally try to convey that we do n't control the process once the ama is up and that 's the main reason people like it . 
  if they do n't want to answer questions without a filter , amas are n't for them . 
  have met / u/chooter in person , can confirm that she looks like a cross between morgan freeman and woody harrelson . 
  i do n't know if i 've made a mod action there . 
  i just mod there because i like you guys . 
  someone should probably remove me . 
  if you 're ever interested in crushing free speech you should apply here . 
  stepping down from / r/pics is better for your resume than being a mod there in my books . 
  fun fact , these are actually called [ mondegreens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondegreen ) . 
  my favourite : `` hold me closer tony danza '' . 
   we 're working on things to deal with this issue, 
  marry me . 
  have you thought about having every new account forced to verify an e-mail address . 
  it 's not a silver bullet but anyone who has taken an intro cog psych class can tell you that any barriers to action are remarkably effective . 
  the only thing dumber than online news polls are people that think online news polls mean anything . 
  holy shit the blooper reel at the end of the spinning one is amazing . 
  it is considered to be a science by every respectable science body , university and journal so of course it would be . 
  that 's the most manu play i 've ever seen .

  your submission has been removed because it is not scientific in nature . 
  no one cares how many drinks you drank or girls you slept with when you 're trying to get into an advanced degree or get a job . 
  just became a teacher , had this in my second class . 
  fuck that kid . 
  you have to learn how to learn . 
  some tips :, 
  1 ) give yourself business hours - treat study like it 's a job where you have a manager that will yell at you if you do n't work . 
  2 ) do small bursts of work with short breaks - e.g. , read 5 pages , 5 minutes on reddit , read 5 pages , 5 minutes on reddit etc. 
  note : 2 works for me but might not work for everyone . 
  i can only focus for short bursts of time on boring parts of my work . 
  if you can focus longer , you should . 
  also , if you 're taking breaks put a time on it . 
  3 ) do n't spend a million hours studying , just work really hard when you * are * studying . 
  4 ) turn up to class and disable the wifi on your laptop/ipad . 
  you will always learn more . 
  5 ) ** do n't try to be too clever ** . 
  i made this mistake so much in undergrad and now that i have my own students i can see them falling into the same trap . 
  do n't make assignments more complicated for yourself to try and show off , just make it abundantly clear that you understand the material well and answer accurately . 
  6 ) ask questions in class . 
  the only dumb question is one you do n't ask . 
  i ca n't be too mad at this kid because i do n't think he 's doing it maliciously , he just does n't understand that the class is n't all about him . 
  do n't worry about how many friends you have , just focus on finding friends with similar interests/ideals . 
  it 's like dating , if you pretend to be someone you 're not , you 're only going to find people that do n't match up well with you . 
  be yourself and find the people who like * that * person . 
  if you 're a genuine person who is * kind * and friendly , you 'll make friends .
