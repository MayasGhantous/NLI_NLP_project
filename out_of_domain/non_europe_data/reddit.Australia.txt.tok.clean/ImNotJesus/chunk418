  good ones . 
  just remember that everyone there is a lot more worried about how they look than how you look . 
  everyone is self-absorbed , they do n't notice you anywhere near as much as you think . 
  just be friendly and kind and you 'll find people who you like talking to . 
  get a kettlebell , learn a few basic exercises . 
  the key is n't to do a drastic or particularly hard workout , you do n't even need to be overly clever with the types of exercises you pick . 
  just do ** something ** every day and try to use different muscles as you do . 
  trying to maximise workouts really does n't matter that much if it 's just for fitness/health . 
  you 're there to learn . 
  remember that . 
  university will be over one day , make the most of it . 
  2 works for me . 
  it may not for you .

  never forget that abbott ** did not ** present a belt-tightening budget . 
  he presented an ** ideologically motivated ** budget . 
  spending on education was cut but money to school chaplain programs increased . 
   total elimination of migraine headaches was reported in 51.3 % , greater than 80 % resolution of symptoms in 20.5 % , and 28.2 % had resolution between 50-80 % . 
  no significant effect was reported after 9.3 % of procedures . 
  there were no major adverse events . 
  they are fairly remarkable results . 
  while 35 is a small sample size for a social psychology study , i 'm guessing that for something involving a surgery it 's actually quite highly powered . 
  while it 's important to remember that there was n't a control here , the size of the study does n't seem to be too big an issue with that sort of effect size .

  that being said , people are willing to spend insane amounts more on foods they perceive to be healthier . 
  review after review has shown that there are no health benefits to eating organic ( except for a couple of small findings that suggest there * may * be a benefit for fetuses ) . 
  i 'd also challenge ** anyone ** to pick out the organic food in a blind taste test . 
  however , people are still willing to pay ~ 50 % extra because it ** feels ** healthier . 
  really ? 
  friendsofsyria.co is n't giving me the most up to date and unbiased news ?

  do n't even get me started on chemical free food . 
  i decided to drop out of university and my mum agreed on the condition i saw someone . 
  i kept working at it and things improved over time . 
  like every feeling the depression will come and go and over time you will hopefully feel the bad things less and the good things more . 
  it happened to me and it can to you too . 
  one thing that really helped me was focusing on exercise . 
  every day , no matter how long for , i made a point to do * some * exercise , even if it was for just 5 minutes . 
  if nothing else , i did that 1 positive thing every day . 
  is n't it i r o n i c i r o n i c i c. 
  alternative medicine . 
  you 're allowed to believe ** all sorts ** of crazy , weird and wrong shit . 
  i sat silently while mormon coworkers told me how the devil causes homosexuality . 
  cool . 
  but when you start saying that it 's okay for people with no medical skills or training to dispense medicine that does n't work to people who are sick , i have no choice but to argue . 
  it 's like a physical compulsion . 
  if you tell me you went to a homeopath/naturopath/acupuncturist etc. , i 'm going to tell you why you really should n't . 
  you need to press enter twice in between each line or it does n't format it for you . 
   the effects of pot can and do often lead to better health, 
  i do n't know that you can make that claim .

  this is a science subreddit . 
  science is n't decided by popular opinion , it 's who can provide evidence . 
  we are not going to lower the comment standards any time soon . 
  he means `` let more in '' in reference to the difference between / r/science and / r/everythingscience . 
  more posts will be allowed on / r/everythingscience but we will still have submission standards . 
  we can only hope !, 
  in all seriousness though , it 's a tricky situation . 
  the issue really stems from terrible science reporting . 
  all we ask in / r/science is that it relates to research from the last 6 months . 
  unfortunately , most news articles about new findings , especially when it comes to medicine , are wildly exaggerated . 
  however , given the lack of open access to journals and generally impenetrable language , we ca n't exactly force people to only post links to the articles themselves . 
  that 's why we 're working so hard to get more scientists users , with flair , so we can make sure that the bad reporting is at least called out in the comments section . 
  we also try to flair the submission when the moderators notice it . 
  if you have any other ideas we 're always happy to hear it . 
  not at all . 
  it 's just how science works . 
  go to a science conference and see what happens after a talk . 
  you have immensely respected professors finishing a talk about their new study and all of the questions are challenging their methodology or interpretation . 
  science is n't about who is talking , it 's about who presents what evidence . 
  allowing the standards to drop because we 're worried about people 's feelings is far more insulting than removing low quality comments . 
  also , we have a responsibility here as mods . 
  this subreddit has over 6 million subscribers and roughly the same number of views * per month * . 
  we are not going to allow this subreddit to proliferate pseudoscience just because * you * want to provide unscientific responses . 
  this is the top post on an old default subreddit , it gets a lot of traffic . 
  if you think i 'm engaging in vote manipulation feel free to message the admins . 
  also , i do n't run reddit , i just try to make a couple of little pockets of it better . 
  that 's not how science works though . 
  it absolutely ** should ** be investigated but we always assume the null hypothesis ( that something does n't work in this case ) until there 's evidence to say otherwise . 
  uggghh , it would just be so much more convenient for hockey if all of us non rich people would just give up and die already . 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  it got better . 
  first few episodes were pretty average but it was pretty gripping by the end of the season . 
  when you click the flair option , you can retype it by hand . 
  if it 's , let 's say a combination between neuroscience and psychology , click the one you think it 's closer to ( for sorting reasons ) and retype it as neuroscience/psychology . 
  this is awesome . 
  thank you . 
  hey buddy . 
  it 's literally the first comment on almost any post where correlation is mentioned . 
  also , just saying that correlation does n't equal causation does n't discredit correlation analyses . 
  they 're useful and have their place . 
  many people seem to think that the aim of all research is to prove causation . 
  someone actually made a comment like that .
