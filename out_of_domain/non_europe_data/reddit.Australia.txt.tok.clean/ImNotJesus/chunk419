  i obviously removed it but my favourite part was :, 
   aaron swartz did n't die so you could ruin reddit like a bunch of leader-faggots . 
  thanks . 
  we really try . 
  the problem is that because of our size , once a post hits number one in the sub it rockets up / all . 
  the comment quality ** drastically ** changes . 
  thanks !, 
  oh , haha , did n't realise you were being sarcastic before . 
  yeah , like it 's important to teach people the scope/context of correlation . 
  hell , i just taught my students about correlation a few days ago and showed them [ this ] ( http://sparrowism.soc.srcf.net/home/piratesarecool4.gif ) as an example but the pseudointellectual hatred of correlation drives me up the wall . 
  working on it :, 
  i just have 0 time right now to spend the hours needed to organise it all . 
  you should apply for flair . 
  we 'll add you as a comment mod and you can help with the project . 
  up to you . 
  the option is there though . 
   you 've said this before , and i can understand how you guys need to make bucks for the time spent here , but why are you still hypocritically allowing i fucking love science blogspam in / r/science ? 
  no mods here make any money from being a mod . 
  it 's strictly against reddit 's tos and if i suspected any mod of doing it i 'd be reporting it to the admins immediately . 
  do you have any evidence that any mods are making money indirectly from being a mod here ? 
  that 's a pretty big claim to make if you do n't . 
  i know you 're not accusing me personally but as mods we take our credibility very seriously . 
  you saying that someone is manipulating the system just because it 's possible hurts our credibility . 
  you should be careful making claims like that if you have no proof . 
   do you guys consider iflscience.com to be a legitimate website worthy of submission in the strictly moderated space in / r/science ? 
  if the post fits the rules it fits the rules . 
  we do n't ban domains lightly . 
   do you think banning that site , which is essentially a facebook group blog promoting sensationalist click bait titles , would be detrimental to this sub ? 
  i have n't looked into their quality enough to know . 
  if they 're promoting new research , probably not . 
  the sad reality is that most science reporting is clickbait these days . 
   but i do remember you guys promoting people to submit this shitty website in your everything science sub when it was introduced . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  genuinely terrifying to think how close we were to that war going very differently . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
   atheism is the belief there is no god, 
  no it is n't , it 's the lack of belief in a god . 
  one does n't need to assert the non-existence of something to not believe in it . 
  what you 're referring to is gnostic atheism . 
  yeah , i 'm glad it 's not actually in australia because that truck on the top left of screen is about to drive into some serious oncoming traffic . 
  hey everyone , / r/everythingscience mod here . 
  just wanted to welcome you all say thank you to those who come and check us out . 
  as it says above , it 's the ( relatively ) new sister subreddit to / r/science so it 's run by scientists who care about the public consuming as much science as possible . 
  we hope you enjoy and learn something during your visit . 
  if you have any questions , please feel free to ask . 
  walking into the room when your mother is changing .

  best decision i ever made .

  hi haokun32 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 5 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5 - ) and appears to be soap-boxing , or otherwise is a rhetorical or loaded question . 
  you 're welcome to rephrase it and post again in a way more inviting of real discussion . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2dj16s/why_are_we_tipping_servers/ ) . 
  you and karmanaut . 
  glad you like it !, 
   it was 99 percent not rape, 
  i 'd love to see your equation for that . 
  homeopathy and other alternative medicines . 
  i 've never heard a good argument for why it should be legal for someone with no medical training to sell medicine with no proof that it does anything to sick people . 
  like , if i buy a couch and the couch ca n't perform its most basic function ( hold my weight ) , i 'm entitled to a refund and damages . 
  yet people can go around selling ** medicine ** that does n't do anything . 
  we have a leader who does n't believe that global warming is a real thing . 
  this should not be surprising to anyone . 
  i ate my first pizza when i was 23 . 
  i 've been trying to make up for lost time since . 
  that was amazing . 
  i did n't like cheese or tomato . 
  i grew into liking cheese and tomato . 
  partly because i tried pizza and liked it . 
  when i was in my last year of high school my best friend 's dad died . 
  i did n't cope with it ( i was really close to their family , used to go on holiday with them ) and was n't a good friend . 
  we drifted apart as a result . 
  he does n't hold it against me and we 're mostly not that close anymore because we live very different lives but i 'll always feel sad looking back knowing that i let him down when he needed me most . 
  i wish i had something profound or helpful to say but all i have is `` i 'm sorry '' . 
  hi learner_2 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  rule number 1 in / r/everythingscience :, 
  all posts must be scientific in nature and maintain some level of scientific integrity . 
  posts that are unrelated to science , promoting pseudoscience or are unscientific in nature will be removed . 
  probably also relevant is from the comment section of the rules :, 
  arguments that run counter to well established scientific theories ( e.g. , evolution , gravity , global warming ) require a higher standard of evidence . 
  comments that are overtly fringe and/or unsubstantiated will be removed , since these claims can not be verified in published papers . 
  i actually did a few years ago and we had a good hug over it . 
  i do n't think we 'll ever be that close again just because we 're now quite different people but you were right , telling him did make a big difference for both of us . 
  even though he forgave me , i 'll still never forgive myself though . 
  thank you . 
   what 's the point of linking this to a different subreddit ? 
  it 's a way of showing you the type of content available on / r/everythingscience . 
  it 's likely that most of the people that use / r/science would love reading / r/everythingscience if they had the opportunitiy . 
   what 's the point of having two subreddits with the same things ? 
  they are n't the same thing . 
  in / r/science we only allow posts that discuss peer-reviewed research from the last 6 months . 
  while it 's important we keep up those stringent standards , there 's a lot of good content that gets missed out on . 
  that 's why we created / r/everythingscience .
