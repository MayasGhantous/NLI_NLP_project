  the cell article ? 
  yes . 
  think of this as an announcement post but instead of just describing what / r/everythingscience is we 're giving an example . 
  it 's not an advertisement and we are n't trying to trick anyone here . 
  i have no idea what you 're saying . 
  this is an announcement post from the mods . 
  it 's linking to an article on a different subreddit that we think our users would be interested in . 
  in all subreddits the mods make meta posts that do n't fit within the rules , it 's one of their roles . 
  for example , we have the science ama series . 
  it 's about control and projecting your internal feelings outward . 
  anger is the easiest emotion and for people without the ability or desire to express or experience how they feel , the only way for it to come out is with anger and trying to control the world . 
  the weirdest part is when you realise that all of your conscious experience is a set of nodes in your brain that can be easily disrupted . 
  take for example prosopagnosia ( face blindness ) . 
  there 's a disorder where people can see everything completely fine ... except for faces . 
  they simply ca n't distinguish one face from another . 
  you do n't think of face recognition as a separate little area of your brain but it is . 
  hello dont_tell_plz . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  [ where op got the idea to use futurama for the middle from ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2dwmvx/handy_dandy_venn_diagram_for_your_tv_watching/cjtu948 ), 
  mod of both / r/science and / r/iama here . 
  the big difference is that the mods endorse individual scientist amas . 
  we help them set it up and have strict rules for who can and ca n't do an ama . 
  they also tend to sit at # 1 for quite a while . 
  conversely , anyone can submit an ama any time on / r/iama and as most come and go very quickly , having people not answer straight away is detrimental to quality . 
  we also expect much more complex questions and answers in / r/science . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  hello papalvo !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  proof ? 
  mr show ( bob odenkirk 's first big show ) has n't aged that well but comedy fans should definitely check it out . 
  like all sketch it 's a bit hit and miss but there are some awesome sketches and lots of now famous actors/comedians before they made it big . 
  could agree more buuuuut ... do n't manipulate the person who is mad at you by forcing them to comfort you while they 're mad . 
  if you make someone tell you that they love you when they 're trying to express that they 're upset , you 're generally being manipulative . 
  it also only comes once a year . 
  i 'm a ** huge ** fan of the league and all of your work that i 've seen so far . 
  my question is ; what 's it like working on a set where the show is so heavily improvised ? 
  is it a very different experience to working on a more structured set ? 
  you 're a god damn liar . 
  way to make a grown man tear up in a semi-public area . 
  kindness . 
  no need to apologise . 
  thank you for your story , very inspiring . 
  i think greed is too easy and simple to attribute it to in this case . 
  i think it has a much deeper and more psychologically insidious root . 
  abbott and hockey strongly believe in a [ just world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis ) . 
  most of us do ( to different extents ) . 
  you 've probably heard it referred to in terms of blaming rape victims but it also includes motivated cognitions to believe that the world is the way it should be . 
  if you have money and power , you are motivated to believe that you ** deserve ** that money and power . 
  the unfortunate outcome of that , is that it necessitates believing that people who do n't have money and power * also * deserve to be in that position .

  what makes you think freedom of speech is at all relevant here ? 
  this is a moderated subreddit within a private website that has rules . 
  you do n't get to say whatever you want whenever you want just because you invoke `` freedom of speech '' . 
   clearly , i was mistaken, 
  correct . 
  please read the rules before posting again . 
  thanks !, 
  it seemed rude not to respond to someone sending me a message . 
  significance tests are directly related to sample size . 
  the bigger your sample is , the smaller effect size needed for a significant result . 
  remember that significant does n't mean there 's a large effect , it just means that the results are n't likely due to chance alone . 
  an extremely large body of scientific literature says that you 're wrong . 
  it 's not only an extremely ineffective behaviour change tactic ( increases immediate compliance but does n't change long-term behaviour ) and it comes with a series of negative outcomes like a poorer parent-child relationship and high rates of mental illness .

  while i understand the importance and need for improving metrics but are you concerned that counting social and mainstream media impact as factors in your equation that you 're incentivising headline grabbing science while disincentivising doing good science purely for the sake of knowledge ? 
  can confirm , almost drowned because i was too panicked to remember this advice . 
  counsellor , not a fully trained therapist yet but of course . 
  some people are just assholes . 
  that does n't make them any more or less deserving of care . 
  in fact , learning how to treat people who make you feel all sorts of emotions ( positive or negative ) is one of the hardest parts of the job .
