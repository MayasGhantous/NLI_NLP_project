  this is a review of a few different papers . 
  we do n't allow reviews . 
  the article has to be about a single new study . 
  selling alternative medicine . 
  i 've never heard a compelling reason why it should be legal to sell a medical product with no evidence that it works . 
  why , in medicine of all fields , do we make it possible for people with no ( or extremely subpar ) medical training to sell products that are n't properly tested to sick people ? 
  it 's insane to me . 
  journal abstract - http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optiontobuy&amp;id=2014-33484-001, 
  it 's important to point out that we are talking about the authors using an extremely complicated model and only finding a very small effect size . 
  a 1 standard deviation increase in marijuana use ( when holding constant a huge number of covariates ) relates to a 5 % change in rates of domestic violence * in this sample * of couples from buffalo who agreed to do a questionnaire in a courthouse before getting married and were available for 6 follow ups and stayed married for at least 9 years .

  i 'm a psychology phd student studying a combination of personality and social psychology as well as a volunteer phone counselor . 
  ama about either . 
  what does your day to day job involve ? 
  phd depends on the day . 
  there 's normally 4/5 projects i 'm working on at a time so i 'll be working towards one of them ( meetings/reading/analysing data/trying to find new sources of data etc. ) . 
  other days i 'm teaching or trying to just broadly read within my topic so i know what 's going on in the field . 
  phone counselor i do in ~ 5 hour chunks of time and you basically sit in an average looking call centre and take calls .
