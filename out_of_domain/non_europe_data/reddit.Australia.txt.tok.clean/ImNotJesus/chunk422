  they range from 10 minutes to 1.5 hours and can be anything from an old person feeling lonely to someone with a knife in their hand . 
  it 's intense and harrowing at times but i generally walk out with more energy than i walk in with . 
  why what ? 
  have you ended up hurt ? 
  what 's a charity casino ? 
  i 'm from australia where you do an honours degree after undegrad and then you can go into masters ( clinical training to be a therapist ) , phd ( pure research ) or doctorate ( combination ) . 
  i went into the phd but may go back and do a masters later . 
  i have n't , no but have done some training for face to face counselling . 
  one big consideration with phone counselling is that you need to be aware that you 're not there to make sure that they 're okay afterwards and wo n't ever speak to them again ( most likely ) so you ca n't challenge them to the same degree . 
  i get to spend my days learning about topics that i think are fascinating . 
  i love psychology . 
  i 'm fascinated by people and what makes them tick . 
  have to be boring and ca n't give details for confidentiality reasons . 
  you do end up having quite funny chats with some people though . 
  in australia masters gives you clinical training while the phd is about research . 
  a masters gives you the ability to practice as a therapist . 
  no classes . 
  you get a supervisor and 3 years and that 's it . 
  make your own stuff . 
  there 's normally 4/5 projects i 'm working on at a time so i 'll be working towards one of them ( meetings/reading/analysing data/trying to find new sources of data etc. ) . 
  other days i 'm teaching or trying to just broadly read within my topic so i know what 's going on in the field . 
  i work weekends , get paid research assistant work and also tutor . 
  the biggest thing i did n't expect was how hard it would be to juggle everything, 
  i believe that 's pretty standard for a phd, 
  nope . 
  not in australia .

  ze infant mind is designed to go through several stages of development . 
  in each stage , if ze infant does not complete ze stage successfully , they develop sexual desires to compensate . 
  there is a substage during the phallic stage that occurs at roughly 4-5 years old where ze infant realises that their mother is their primary source of transport but they have no control over where they are being taken . 
  if they can successfully feel control over where they are going , proper development will continue . 
  in your case , because you lacked power during this transport stage , you have ze desire to feel powerful and sexually dominate the transport that you were not able to control . 
  as this fetish develops , you should experience yourself roleplaying as a variety of physically dominant characters sexually dominating different modes of transport . 
  it 's a bit different in psych in australia, 
  i did a 6 month course with the group i phone counsel with . 
  hello willdrawyouakirby . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  the resources i linked to are n't just for suicidal people . 
  there are a lot of help lines that are exactly what you were looking for . 
  probably depends on your university . 
  i transferred from a business course .

  similarly , that mitchel and webb look should be seen by everyone all the time . 
  too much blood going to other areas, 
  that 's the thing , celebrity pictures ** never ** live up to the hype . 
  how could they ? 
  they 're just pictures of women 's bodies . 
  nice ones but it 's not like when jennifer lawrence takes her top off some cliche movie style bright light emits from her chest . 
  i do n't think we can deny that a big part of the attraction for a lot of people is ( a ) the taboo and ( b ) the power over someone powerful . 
  it 's no different to creepshots or facebookcleavage or candidfashionpolice etc. 
  people are getting off on the power . 
  edit : to be clear , i do n't think that the ** only ** reason people are enjoying these pictures are the reasons i listed above , i 'm just saying that it 's an element playing a role here . 
  you really do n't need an actuary to work out that $ 6000 is a drop in the ocean for a big name charity and refusing the donation gets them a lot of good press that would normally cost more than that . 
  of course they are . 
  everyone wants to think of themselves as a good person . 
  it 's just human nature . 
  which is the utilitariam response in that version of the trolley dilemma . 
  there are so many now i lose track . 
  it was fairly inside baseball but i was continuing his reference to the extremely well researched [ trolley problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolley_problem ) . 
  it 's basically the backbone of moral psychology over the last ~ 13 years .
