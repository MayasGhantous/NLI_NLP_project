  what if i told you, 
  money for cancer is more important than some girl 's boobs, 
  yeah , if you could just accept our money, 
  that would be great . 
  wants to raise money for prostate cancer, 
  does n't accept money, 
  this is the internet , no one is going to tell you off for swearing . 
  proof ? 
  basically you sit in a phone room and answer whatever call drops in . 
  i did a 6 month training program through the people that run the line , it was an amazing learning experience . 
  you really do n't need an actuary to work out that $ 6000 is a drop in the ocean for a big name charity and refusing the donation gets them a lot of good press that would normally cost more than that . 
  i guarantee you that this move will earn them well over $ 6,000 . 
  hold on , hold on . 
  do you actually believe that $ 1,000,000 was going to be raised ? 
  hey , look man , whatever helps you abate the guilt . 
  there 's no chance there would be a linear progression and i hope no one * actually * thought that the money would be taken . 
  this whole thing is just an insane circlejerk attempting to feel good about a really , really creepy thing and your angry responses suggest you should probably take a step back . 
  either way , i wish you the best of luck . 
  actual scientific information on garlic - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/300.html, 
  we 've talked about limiting both before but have never really come to a consensus on it . 
  thanks for your well thought out case . 
  i hate this statement . 
  every single / r/science post with a correlation analysis has this as one of the top comments . 
  correlation does n't ** prove ** causation but it does , with theory , suggest that a relationship exists . 
  that relationship may be causal . 
  saying that it does n't * imply * causation is inaccurate because in many cases it does . 
  the correlation between nutrition and height does indeed imply causation . 
  i agree that people need to be aware that correlation does n't ** prove ** causation but a dumb phrase like that does n't help the cause of science education . 
  i love teaching my psych students about this stuff . 
  [ here is a comprehensive but not complete list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases ) of some common cognitive biases . 
  studies show that spending a sum of money to help someone else gives you a greater net gain to your moment to moment happiness than using the same amount of money on yourself . 
  in short , we have in built mechanisms to make socially positive behaviours rewarding . 
  so , be kind to people , it will make you feel good . 
  [ link to one of the many studies ] ( http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/norton-spendingmoney.pdf ), 
  also , just because someone else believes something , that also does n't make it true . 
  that blog you linked to does n't actually provide any evidence , it 's just someone 's opinion . 
  til . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i still wish people would say `` correlation does n't prove causation '' since that 's not the way most people interpret the word imply .

  this is literally curing prostate cancer right now . 
  that sounds great . 
  thank you, 
  i thought the f stood for fancy . 
  my chest feels funny, 
  sitting on the floor aiming upwards, 
  i did a course through the local hotline . 
  have a look at their website , i 'm sure all of the information is on there . 
  that seems like a pretty flawed metric . 
  libya is ranked # 11 with an average life expectancy of 75 years just because they pay an obscenely small amount of money .

  hello brixisbiz . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  reach out to someone you want to work with asap . 
  find out if you can volunteer in their lab or come to journal meetings . 
  so does that mean you 're going to ban / r/photoplunders or do you only do it when celebrity agents send you the notices ? 
  this is the ** exact same ** thing you guys do every time there 's bad press . 
  deal with it at the last possible moment ( like / r/jailbait ) once there 's bad press forcing you to do so . 
  then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it does n't set a precedent . 
  it is ** identical ** to what always happens . 
  exactly fucking this . 
  they all know well and good that / r/photoplunder ( nsfw ) is still around . 
  they ** know ** that this website has been used to host pictures of women without their consent for years but they do nothing . 
  they 're doing the ** exact same ** thing they do every time there 's bad press . 
  deal with it at the last possible moment ( like / r/jailbait ) once there 's bad press forcing them to do so . 
  then they play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it does n't set a precedent . 
  it is ** identical ** to what always happens . 
   the issue is about consent rather than censorship . 
  how long until you ban / r/photoplunder then ? 
  exactly . 
  their `` free speech '' stance is nothing but being scared of creating precedent and actually having to monitor the shitty parts of reddit that they pretend do n't exist . 
  they 're pictures of naked women in private places . 
  they 're nothing but stolen pictures . 
  come on . 
  you ca n't honestly believe that . 
   but there are no notices coming from lawyers because of that subreddit . 
  ftfy, 
  i 've removed your submission from iama . 
  location-based amas go to [ / r/ilivein ] ( http://reddit.com/r/ilivein ) . 
  just so we 're clear : the subreddit was taken down ** not ** because they were pictures that were being hosted without the consent of the woman ? 
  i 'm not angry they took down / r/thefappening . 
  i think it 's fucking fantastic . 
  i 'm angry because they 're being hypocrites about it and there are disgusting subreddits they should have taken downs years ago . 
  you ca n't let a corner of reddit become a cesspool and then act morally superior when more filth builds up . 
  definitely . 
  i 'm sure that every single one of those pictures was obtained legally and posted with the woman 's consent . 
  they 're doing the ** exact same ** thing they do every time there 's bad press . 
  deal with it at the last possible moment ( like / r/jailbait ) once there 's bad press forcing them to do so . 
  then they play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it does n't set a precedent . 
  it is ** identical ** to what always happens .
