  edit : [ here is the blog post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/ ) from when they banned / r/jailbait . 
  note the exact same thing . 
  `` we 've decided that it 's time for a change '' that happens to coincide with [ anderson cooper doing a story about it on cnn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/controversial_reddit_communities#.2fr.2fjailbait ) . 
  edit 2 : to be clear , i understand * why * they 're doing it . 
  i understand that a lot of companies do the same which is ** totally fine ** . 
  just do n't then make a blog post about how wonderful free speech is . 
  if the blog post said `` we actually wanted to keep allowing them but got to many notices from lawyers for that to work so we had to ban them '' that would be * fine * by me . 
  the doublepseak and hypocrisy is what 's annoying me . 
  you ca n't take the moral highground on this when you 've let / r/photoplunder stay open for however long it has . 
  do n't forget / r/photoplunder - a subreddit devoted to stolen naked pictures of women . 
  i guess consent only matters when you 're getting a letter from a lawyer . 
  i ** love ** that they took down / r/thefappening even if it was a few days too late . 
  what i hate is the hypocrisy and doublespeak in the way they 're doing it . 
  no you 're getting downvoted because you 're a moron . 
  which is ** totally fine ** .

  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  exactly my problem . 
  it 's exactly what they did with / r/jailbait . 
  if you 're just taking it down for legal reasons say that , do n't make it sound like you 're doing it for the moral high ground . 
  so what about women who do n't know their pictures are being used like on / r/photoplunder ? 
  they should just have their privacy violated ? 
  here 's why i 'm angry . 
  you 're doing the ** exact same ** thing you do every time there 's bad press . 
  deal with it at the last possible moment ( like / r/jailbait ) once there 's bad press forcing you to do so . 
  then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it does n't set a precedent . 
  it is ** identical ** to what always happens . 
  [ here is the blog post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/ ) from when you banned / r/jailbait . 
  note the exact same thing .

  you ca n't take the moral highground on this when you 've let / r/photoplunder stay open for however long it has . 
  this is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes . 
  if you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs , ** of course ** people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities . 
  it would be impossible for that to not seem capricious . 
  if you allow subreddits like / r/niggers , ** of course ** they 're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade . 
  the fine users of / r/jailbait are sharing kiddy porn ? 
  what a ** shocking ** revelation . 
  the point is , you ca n't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall . 
  stand up for standards for a change . 
  actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be . 
  you 'll piss off some people but who cares ? 
  they 're the shitty people you do n't want anyway . 
  instead you 're just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls . 
  that 's fine . 
  take it down . 
  i 'm annoyed that they acted like they were doing it for moral reasons with that sanctimonious blog post instead of just saying it . 
  the tagline is what makes me feel most ill about it . 
  but that 's what happens when you 're so scared of setting precedent and refuse to do anything about the shitty parts of reddit . 
  if they actually established a policy of not allowing nsfw subreddits where women are exploited or maybe you ca n't have subreddits based on racism then you set the tone of what people expect . 
  if you go on and on about how free speech is sacrosanct , you get this when you want to step in . 
  that 's the problem with not just coming out in the first place and saying `` we got a bunch of letters from lawyers and now we have to ban it '' . 
  if you try to take the moral high ground this is what happens . 
  well said !, 
  no one is saying that it is their current stance , that would be stupid . 
  what people are arguing is that it 's a shitty stance that needs to be updated . 
  hello solitarysoldier !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
   i dont get why reddit are crying about this , its stolen property , we have no right to view it in the first place . 
  stop acting like rabid dogs and try being an adult, 
  huh ? 
  i 'm angry because they 're not going far enough . 
  that 's the funny thing about this situation . 
  half of the people are angry because it got banned , half are angry because they want more banned . 
  just wait for reddit to get distracted by the new shiniest thing . 
  nope, 
  i 've been going off about this stuff for years now . 
  i 've had pm conversations with admins about it , sent numerous adminmails . 
  the lack of care about standards drives me up the wall and this is finally my chance to have people hear how i feel about it . 
  i 'd love to see his jackdaw, 
  would you be willing to take the risk ? 
  it was an awesome fight but your fights always are . 
  no reason for a rematch , why go backwards when you so clearly won ? 
  it was n't for a title , chiesa did n't get robbed by the judges and you do n't owe him shit . 
  keep climbing that ladder joe . 
  mostly for fun and posterity, 
  my car . 
  bought a sporty and super unreliable car for 16.5 k , spent about 6k on repairs in total and sold it for 2k only 4 years later . 
  not my smartest decision ever . 
  edit : it was an alfa, 
  i 've enjoyed psych more each step along the way . 
  phd is really fun so far . 
  i did n't have a minor , it probably works different in australia . 
  italian, 
  this, 
  that looks like vfl to me . 
  shots , fired !, 
  that was the problem . 
  they * love * alfas on top gear . 
  i think i can see the governator, 
  it 's not my strongest area but i guess so, 
  i 'm definitely not a psychometrics expert . 
  i 've only done a couple of subjects on it .
