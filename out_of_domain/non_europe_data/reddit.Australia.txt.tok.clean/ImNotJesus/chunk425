  hello awesome_shit !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  and clean up a little bit . 
  your cum is everywhere, 
  i really do n't buy that they deliberately waited for extra revenue before banning . 
  this was uncharted territory and the admins were right not to act immediately . 
  by the sounds of it they tried to manage the situation but once the dmcas started flying in there was no way they could let the fappening subs stay up . 
  apparently it 's okay because they have n't received any dmcas . 
  sure , there 's no way for the women in the pictures to know that they 're there and send one but that 's irrelevant . 
  this is great but one note : we learn in suicide prevention never to try and make the person feel guilty by trying to make them think about how doing it would hurt other people . 
  things like `` imagine how much people will miss you '' or in this case talking about the effect of seeing someone dead on the sidewalk only adds to the emotion . 
  in general , your aim is to safely defuse the emotion of the situation , not heighten it . 
  that 's not to say you avoid talking about emotive things , just that making them think about hurting people does n't serve any purpose except heightening the situation . 
  also , do n't forget that from 8pm-4am you can chat to lifeline online - https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/online-services/online-services, 
  i live in australia so i woke up and it had already happened . 
  i just remember seeing it played on tv over and over and it seeming like it was a movie . 
  it did n't look real . 
  just by chance , and i did n't even realise it was the day before 9/11 , i was listening to a song yesterday i had n't heard in years . 
  it 's called [ the 12th of september ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zypd3myjne ) by an australian singer named xavier rudd . 
  it 's basically that immediate reaction we all had of `` things are just different now '' but did n't know how yet . 
  create extremely tight restrictions on selling medicine and alternative medicines that basically made it impossible to sell untested products or practice in alternative medicine . 
  i 'm still yet to hear a convincing reason why it should be legal to sell medicines that ( at best ) do n't have evidence showing their efficacy or ( at worst ) are shown to not work/be harmful . 
  it 's insane to me . 
  i imagine it did take quite a while with those hands and short arms . 
  there 's absolutely no good reason to think that 's the case , irrespective of any youtube video you link me . 
  masters is the clinical pathway and phd is the research pathway . 
  you can do either without doing the other . 
  if you feel like a fuck up because you do n't live up to their expectations , they * did n't * raise you right . 
  if they did , you would know that you are loved no matter what . 
  in fact , that 's probably the case and they would be mortified if you knew you feel that way . 
  have they ever given you a good reason to think you 've failed ? 
  in what way have you thrown it away ? 
  i can certainly hear you have a lot of regrets . 
  what 's your relationship like with your parents right now ? 
  do you have a desire to try to go back to school ? 
  do you think your parents could be proud of you as a bartender if it was making you happy/ier, 
  so what 's stopping you ? 
  look , st kilda fans need a win . 
  just get your parents to pay for a boob job . 
  problem solved . 
  jokes aside , it sounds like your parents are pretty supportive . 
  why do you think the relationship has broken down ? 
  so why do n't you talk to them more ? 
  hi autonomynow , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  meditation has basically become the most studied topic in psychology over the last 15 years . 
  learning to do some basic breathing meditations ( which anyone capable of breathing can learn to do ) has drastic impacts on your mental and physical health . 
  celeb nudes never live up to expectations because they 're just women 's bodies . 
  sure , they 're nice women 's bodies but the way some people talk about jennifer lawrence on here i think they were expecting a beacon of pure light to appear when she took her top off . 
  the amount of variation in how nice a pair of breasts can be is pretty small . 
  i agree with / u/ewwig that it * is * definitely better with someone you love but overall i do agree . 
  sex is pretty overrated . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's fun , your bits feel nice and if done right , you feel really close to the person you do it with afterwards . 
  that being said , i think that there 's so much ego involved that it 's so rarely about the sex itself . 
  it 's about wanting to feel attractive , or proving that you can get it or worrying because you 're not getting it etc. 
  these are all normal things but distractions from what sex actually is . 
  yeah , that 's not your dad 's . 
  i 've seen this picture on reddit a few times already . 
  i do n't really care about reposting in general because if people upvote it , it means they want to see it but this is just straight up lying .

  i could really go a chris borscht right now . 
  right , but just because you can do things to lower your chances of it happening , does n't mean that you 're in any way at fault . 
  if i never left the house , i 'd be at a lower risk of being hit by a car but that does n't mean that i 'm partially responsible if a car veers off the road and hits me while i 'm walking down the sidewalk . 
  you accidentally posted this on / r/funny . 
  i think you were looking for / r/validatemyopinion, 
  a giant , co-ordinated project to understand mental illness . 
  our knowledge is drastically behind the rest of medicine and it 's becoming apparent that the brain , and mental illness in particular , is far more complex than ever imagined . 
  i 'm talking a co-ordinated effort between neurologists , neuropsychs , neuroscientists , clinical psychologists , clinical psychology researchers , endocrinologists etc. 
  trying to break down every element of why some people become mentally ill . 
  and one of the zs would need to be a blank, 
  done . 
   she also discussed a study done on environmentalhealthtrust.org, 
  that 's where i stopped reading . 
  thank god . 
  i 'm so sick of all of that terrorism we get in australia .
