  * it violates [ [ rule 5 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5 - ) and appears to be soap-boxing , or otherwise is a rhetorical or loaded question .

  on the plus side , stuff like this really brings the racist facebook friends out of the woodwork so it 's a good way to identify and get rid of them . 
  those m&m s look stoned as hell . 
  eh , work it out for yourself . 
  you win because you do n't give your money to a charlatan . 
  they literally ca n't . 
  it 's not evidence based practice , plus , fun fact , chiropractic adjustment leads to higher risk of stroke . 
  because there 's no evidence that chiropractic adjustment actually does that . 
  also , you read one of * many * studies on the topic . 
  another example - http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/32/5/1054.abstract, 
  which is why a parent 's style should n't involve witholding love or having the child feel threatened . 
  it 's part of the reason why corporal punishment is such a [ wildly ineffective strategy ] ( http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/gershoff-2002.pdf ) . 
  you can have discipline will still showing your child that they are loved and cared for . 
  even weirder is prosopagnosia or `` face blindness '' . 
  it 's a very specific type of brain damage where people can see completely fine but ca n't recognise any faces . 
  it 's particularly cool because it means that there 's a very specific part of our brain that is solely devoted to recognising faces and faces alone . 
  that 's some reddit level edginess right there . 
  wait , what ? 
  you think that reading an abstract and thinking you no more than ( a ) the scientists who wrote the papers or ( b ) the scientists who reviewed the papers is not `` killing with facts '' . 
  you are so much more manly than i 'll ever be . 
  i changed a downlight recently though so i 've got that going for me . 
  can someone please eli5 the context of this for someone who does n't know anything about nfl ? 
  hi heartbroken222 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ), 
  * it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone . 
  for personal matters , consider / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self .

  i ca n't wait for the 1965 election, 
  stupidity is a bit harsh . 
  i would n't say that ricki-lee really danced up a storm but you have to allow a bit of creative license . 
  not necessarily my favourite but i listen to it the most often . 
  [ art is dead ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkivv2iqtm4 ) by bo burnham . 
  just a perfect comedy song . 
  clearly different . 
  the end of days one is slightly more red . 
  trp is full of wildly misogynistic content . 
  sorry but this is n't something we will be changing any time soon . 
  my wife thinks i get excited for her to go out for some alone time . 
  pfft , it 's because i want to shit with the door open . 
  it 's the simple pleasures in life my friend . 
  might as well call it an ipood, 
  the ability to give people a small shock over the internet . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  here 's why i 'm angry . 
  you 're doing the ** exact same ** thing you do every time there 's bad press . 
  deal with it at the last possible moment ( like / r/jailbait ) once there 's bad press forcing you to do so . 
  then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it does n't set a precedent . 
  it is ** identical ** to what always happens . 
  [ here is the blog post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/ ) from when you banned / r/jailbait . 
  note the exact same thing . 
  `` we 've decided that it 's time for a change '' that happens to coincide with [ anderson cooper doing a story about it on cnn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/controversial_reddit_communities#.2fr.2fjailbait ) . 
  to be clear , i understand * why * you 're doing it . 
  i understand that a lot of companies do the same which is ** totally fine ** . 
  just do n't then make a blog post about how wonderful free speech is . 
  if the blog post said `` we actually wanted to keep allowing them but got too many notices from lawyers for that to work so we had to ban them '' that would be * fine * by me . 
  the doublepseak and hypocrisy is what 's annoying me . 
  you ca n't take the moral highground on this when you 've let / r/photoplunder stay open for however long it has . 
  this is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes . 
  if you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs , ** of course ** people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities . 
  it would be impossible for that to not seem capricious . 
  if you allow subreddits like / r/niggers , ** of course ** they 're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade . 
  the fine users of / r/jailbait are sharing kiddy porn ? 
  what a ** shocking ** revelation . 
  the point is , you ca n't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall . 
  stand up for standards for a change . 
  actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be . 
  you 'll piss off some people but who cares ? 
  they 're the shitty people you do n't want anyway . 
  instead you 're just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls . 
  who do we message about getting you banned for posting a phone number ? 
  that ` everyone is entitled to their opinion ' in matters of objective truth . 
  you are completely entitled to your opinion on subjective matters . 
  believing that vaccines cause autism is n't an opinion , it 's just being wrong about something . 
  if only you 'd listened long enough to hear her say `` which is why i listen to several audiobooks a week instead '' . 
  i 'm doing a phd so obviously have to read a lot but i ca n't stand reading fiction . 
  i just find it boring . 
  i 've tried a range of genres as well as audiobooks but i just do n't find it as compelling as visual media and frankly , anything but relaxing . 
  i used to work in a call centre on weekends and had to wear an uncomfortable work uniform despite never making contact with any customers . 
  what 's worse is that it was a well known ( and despised ) company so if i had to do some shopping on the way home i would always get bombarded by annoyed people unless i brought a spare pair of clothes . 
   the girls are super-shallow, 
  the men too . 
  if you 're meeting people in a place where it 's too loud to talk it 's fair to assume that it 's more physical than emotional . 
  if anything is giving me cancer it 's reading that paragraph . 
  do n't click on the above . 
  it 's a shock picture . 
  ** do not click ** . 
  you just have to remember that this feeling , like all feelings , is temporary . 
  it will come and go like all of your feelings do . 
  while it feels never ending now , you 've never had a feeling that lasted forever have you ? 
  feel what you need to feel now , grieve the loss of not just what you had but what you thought you were going to have in the future and at some point soon you wo n't feel that way any more . 
  it 's just how feelings work . 
  do you mind me asking if it is with him ? 
  that obviously makes things a lot more complicated but it does n't change that right now what you need to do is take care of yourself . 
  no matter what you decide to do , even if it 's getting back together with him , you should do it with a clear head . 
  right now you are completely overwhelmed with emotion which is understandable but does n't make you the best decision maker . 
  your priority right now is to take care of yourself , get through this stage and then work out what 's next .
