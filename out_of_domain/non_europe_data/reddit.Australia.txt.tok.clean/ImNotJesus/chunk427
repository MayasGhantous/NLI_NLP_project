  it is important to note that this does n't mean that exercise `` cures '' adhd or that any child that suffers from adhd has it because they do n't exercise enough . 
  this shows that regular exercise helps adhd sufferers in some of the areas where they have difficulties . 
  that 's a very important distinction . 
  it * could * but this study shows know evidence of that . 
  do n't leap to conclusions . 
  they do that in t20, 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  posts are ranked in comparison to other posts . 
  if you upvote one post , you 're making a whole bunch of other people 's days worse . 
  yeah , what kind of loser wants their peers to think that they 're funny or interesting . 
  i just live in a cocoon of my own smugness instead . 
  i did n't say that it is . 
  i 'm just saying that there 's nothing shameful about being happy that people like something you 're putting out there . 
  if your day is ruined by a bad reddit post then it 's probably a problem but just being happy about a popular post seems fine to me . 
  hello cogsciprofessor !,

  thank you !, 
  if i had the power to do that i would be * so happy * . 
  are n't people who care about the well-being of others the * worst * . 
  let 's just theoretically say that all of their insane theories actually work and all that alpha bullshit actually gives you a higher success rate when trying to sleep with women . 
  even if that was true , why would you ( a ) want to have sex with someone you have manipulated into sleeping with you ( b ) want to be with someone who does n't know who the real you is or ( c ) want to be with a woman that would be attracted to a fucking asshole ? 
  i genuinely ca n't understand why unless you 're simply sleeping with as many women as you can to feed your ego ( depressing ) or you 're such a misogynistic sociopath that manipulating women makes you feel good about yourself ( even more depressing ) . 
  all in all , it 's really fucking depressing . 
  it 's like they purchased `` the game '' but did n't realise what a pathetic individual you would need to be to take anything from `` the game '' . 
  i kind of understand going to a strip club . 
  it 's not for me but i get it . 
  what i do n't get is why you would ever go with a group of friends . 
  there 's nothing about having an erection that makes me think `` hmm , it 'd be great if 8-10 of my friends also had erections right now . '', 
   or you 're such a misogynistic sociopath that manipulating women makes you feel good about yourself ( even more depressing ), 
  so not far off . 
  sadly enough big chunks of reddit are that way .

  wait , an expert in pharmacology was at one stage in the past a consultant for a pharmaceutical company ? 
  this is just terrible journalism . 
  their source is literally the end of his academic papers where he cites his potential conflict of interests . 
   dr. kleber serves or has served on scientific advisory boards or as a consultant to alkermes , ascend media , gruenthal , neuromed , pfizer , purdue pharm a , reckitt benckiser , and teva . 
  yet at the same time the vice article is saying, 
   what 's left unsaid is that kleber has served as a paid consultant, 
  while ** quoting his own words ** . 
  none of these are hidden relationships and in almost all fields academics do consultancy work with industry . 
  that 's why there is a place to mention it in your publications . 
  how about you actually look at their * evidence * instead of trying to drum up bullshit conspiracies that do nothing but shine a light on your lack of understanding of the field ? 
  this article has such a clear agenda . 
  because sex is n't the same as eating a chocolate bar ? 
  it affects other people . 
  american style bbq is some of the most delicious food in the world . 
  it 's impossible to get good american style bbq in australia and it makes me sad .

  pandas heads are purpose built for allowing them to chew through extremely tough bamboo . 
  their jaw muscles go all the way up to the top of their head which is why , if you watch carefully , you can see their ears wiggle when they eat . 
  studies have shown that spending money on someone else gives you a greater boost to your happiness than spending the same amount of money on yourself . 
  this suggests that we evolved an inbuilt desire to be nice to other people . 
  historically , you have about a 15 % chance of dying due to violence . 
  in the last century , despite two world wars , the chance is 3 % . 
  we live in objectively the safest world that has ever existed .

  demetri martin has a similar joke . 
   this summer at a party , i learned that there 's a small but important difference between peeing in the pool and peeing into the pool, 
  there 's a neurological disorder called prosopagnosia where the sufferer has normal vision but is completely incapable of recognising faces . 
  this suggests that social affiliation is so important that we evolved a part of the brain purely for recognising other people 's faces . 
  which is why they need to eat so much of it . 
  pandas are terribly designed .

  on the flip side , it also is n't some miracle drug that cures all cancer that is only being suppressed by big pharma to protect their profits . 
  there are a lot of dumb opinions on both ends of the marijuana debate . 
  modern society . 
  some people seem to have this impression that society is falling apart at the seams when the reality is that we live in objectively the best and safest world that has ever existed . 
  historically , you have about a 15 % chance of dying due to violence . 
  over the last century , despite two world wars and constant smaller ones , the chance was only 3 % .

  hi dr eagleman ,, 
  first let me say that i loved sum . 
  such a unique and thought-inspiring book . 
  one area that i 've really enjoyed hearing you talk about is criminal justice . 
  i 've heard you talk a lot about how our current criminal justice system ignores even our most basic understanding of human psychology and neuroscience and while i completely agree , i 'm wondering what sort of system would be better ? 
  how could we design a criminal justice system around a more sophisticated understanding of people ?
