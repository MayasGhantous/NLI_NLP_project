   i did n't contact him because i plan on changing it extensively still and did n't want to bother him . 
  worst excuse ** ever ** . 
  just look at the part you copy-pasted in , the info is all there . 
  yeah , he had to ctrl + c ** and ** ctrl + v. 
  needed a towel to mop up all the sweat after that one . 
  well , when you steal everything else and claim it as your own you ca n't blame me for assuming you stole that to can you ? 
  the op has edited a link to the ama on her website to act as proof .

  early estimates had him not playing at all last year . 
  he was n't close to 100 % .

  to be fair , it * is * garbage . 
  time to shut down the sub ? 
  i was ( mostly ) teasing, 
  straight off the bat , len is a much better shooter than robin which makes a big difference . 
  it did n't though . 
  all it did was give an unusual amount of power to people representing a very small percentage of the population . 
  i really hope this is an old picture . . 
  i swear you 're following me around . 
  that 's because the minority leadership we had , while not perfect , was n't on the same level of batshit crazy as the current party we have . 
  he was n't even going to play last year his injuries were so bad . 
  do n't use his first season as a guide . 
  i was having an argument with someone on reddit and they not only admitted that they were wrong but apologised for arguing with me about it . 
  5 days . 
  i napped for ~ 1 hour twice in that time . 
  turned out i was having a breakdown i did n't know was happening at the time . 
  i thought it was a fun game . 
  boooo . 
  you always start games when i 'm asleep . 
  this . 
  i 'm sure / u/rasterbee is keen to let me get revenge . 
  just hope that everyone to your east just disappears and you 'll win like raster did, 
  the way we treat our mentally ill . 
  i think we 'll have some embarrassing conversations with our grandchildren about it . 
  we made a hell of a lot of progress in a lot of areas but nowhere near enough in others . 
  libertarian says libertarian things . 
  more news at 11 . 
  get more people for this game . 
  that 's why you need a username that 's always true . 
  offensively , that 's a scary team . 
  i just wonder if they 're a bit slow defensively . 
  chandler is obviously an excellent defensive anchor and parsons is an above average wing defender but i think they 're going to give up a lot of points . 
  i love the idea of a retiring superstar handing their jersey on to a specific player . 
  it happens sometimes in australian football and it 's awesome . 
  the rules of reddit have n't really changed since its inception when the website was very different due to the size , age and how regular the users were . 
  do you think it 's time for reddit to make some changes in how they manage users and content ? 
  do you personally agree with an `` anything goes '' style or do you think there is benefit in demanding standards from users and moderators ? 
  for example , do you think that some of the more vile subreddits are beneficial to reddit ? 
  caught redditting at work ? 
  been there . 
  do you mind me asking what happened ? 
  it 's an ama . 
  you ca n't exactly call someone for talking about the company they work for . 
  i like when people report automod . 
  or , you know , pick the one you like to drink since almost all of the benefit from wine is placebo . 
  professional tasters do terribly in blinded psychological experiments . 
  for example , if you give them white wine with red food dye in it , they use adjectives commonly associated with red wine . 
  edit : [ article about how wine tasting is bullshit ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/you-are-not-so-smart-why-we-cant-tell-good-wine-from-bad/247240/ ) + [ link to full colour study ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist62n/morrot01colorofodors.pdf ), 
  woah , that took like , 8 seconds of googling to find a reference for it . 
  [ article about how wine tasting is bullshit ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/you-are-not-so-smart-why-we-cant-tell-good-wine-from-bad/247240/ ), 
   in one experiment , he got 54 oenology ( the study of wine tasting and wine making ) undergraduates together and had them taste one glass of red wine and one glass of white wine . 
  he had them describe each wine in as much detail as their expertise would allow . 
  what he did n't tell them was both were the same wine . 
  he just dyed the white one red . 
  in the other experiment , he asked the experts to rate two different bottles of red wine . 
  one was very expensive , the other was cheap . 
  again , he tricked them . 
  this time he had put the cheap wine in both bottles . 
  so what were the results ? 
   the tasters in the first experiment , the one with the dyed wine , described the sorts of berries and grapes and tannins they could detect in the red wine just as if it really was red . 
  every single one , all 54 , could not tell it was white . 
  in the second experiment , the one with the switched labels , the subjects went on and on about the cheap wine in the expensive bottle . 
  they called it complex and rounded . 
  they called the same wine in the cheap bottle weak and flat . 
  [ link to full colour study ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist62n/morrot01colorofodors.pdf ), 
  it 's an example of 1 study out of ** many ** . 
  this is a well researched area . 
  i just brought up that one because it 's the funniest to me . 
  you bring up good points and i was probably a bit heavy-handed in my comment . 
  the point i was trying to make is that a large proportion of what we experience in wine is due to faulty perceptions . 
  i 'm not doubting that a botrytis is objectively different to a merlot . 
  i 'm just that spending huge amounts of money and effort on something where so much of the enjoyment is a placebo is a waste . 
  find what you like to drink and do n't worry about ratings , pairings or other people 's perceptions . 
  i 'm australian and use ilp . 
  when i was in america on holiday i was using a proxy to be coming from australia again ( the opposite of what i 'm always doing ) because it 's so much better . 
  i 'm a universal plasma donor so i try to give regularly . 
  i also volunteer for a crisis helpline . 
  labagroth, 
   if you say sexiest , do n't forget to mention feminist . 
  they 're just as bad !, 
  he did n't say anything about * some * . 
  there are some absolute asshole doctors out there but it does n't mean we should say `` do n't forget about doctors , they 're just as bad '',
