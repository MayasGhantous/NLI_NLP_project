  dat rust, 
  that 's an entirely rational hatred . 
  i * ca n't stand * people that think that anything `` natural '' is good and healthy and anything with `` chemicals '' is secretly a cancer-inducing super poison . 
  or , you know , some do n't . 
  how the fuck would you know what every single disabled person in the world thinks ? 
  thinking you do is ** far ** more condescending than offering to help a disabled person . 
  both intriguing in different ways . 
  i 'm happy no matter what happens .

  murder she wroten, 
  oh god , these comments are about to get all sorts of edgy . 
  you learn some horrifying things about humanity doing that . 
  there are two answers to this question :, 
  1 ) sometimes it 's worth trying to maintain standards . 
  all subreddits have rules that try to guide the content in specific directions . 
  in general , our rules are designed to shape the form of the question more than the topic ( e.g. , no more personal stories in titles ) . 
  however , sometimes it is necessary to guide content in other ways to improve overall quality . 
  2 ) as much as we 'd like to think of reddit as a bastion of democracy , the voting system is incredibly flawed . 
  there is , and always will be , a strong skew towards easy/outwardly appealing content over better quality content that requires effort . 
  the reason for that is that a popular post requires a significant number of early votes otherwise it becomes buried in minutes . 
  spend some time in / r/askreddit/new and see how fast the posts move . 
  easy content always wins out over time because ( a ) people can relate/include their own opinions easily and therefore vote on it and ( b ) it 's instantly appealing and therefore gets early momentum . 
  it 's not a truly equal voting system because the first 5-20 votes are overwhelmingly more important than , say , 500-600 when a post is already established on the page . 
  the point is that if you do n't have standards , certain content wins out . 
  that 's why we had to move away from `` i just jumped out of a speeding car at 80 mp/h and survived . 
  what was your wedding experience like ? '', 
  also , it 's worth noting that only something like 1.7 % of the people who use reddit have an account . 
  as a default i feel like we have some level of responsibility to make sure the front page content we provide is n't garbage . 
  / r/tifu and / r/thathappened should just merge already . 
  they 're the exact same stories . 
  it is n't necessarily , but it is on askreddit . 
  you can have excellent and insightful sex questions . 
  the overwhelming majority of what we get is n't that though . 
  hit the nail on the head . 
  this is n't about us being prudish about sex , it 's just us trying to get rid of a lot of shitty questions that regularly hit # 1 just because horny guys want to get off on women talking about sex . 
  edit : see longer explanation [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2jc40s/mod_post_askreddit_is_bringing_back_no_sex_week/clahauh?context=3 ), 
  the logistics of a rule like that are far too difficult to manage for a very small team of volunteers . 
  this . 
  read what actual scientists say about this topic , not click-bait journalists .

  can you please work on making subreddit rules more obvious to app users ? 
  thanks !, 
  because we want to avoid being overly restrictive with the type of content allowed . 
  frankly , this was extremely well received last time and we were flooded with requests to make it permanent . 
  we want to avoid doing that but think it 's necessary for the occasional palate cleanse at least . 
   it does n't make sense and is basically an example of massive sexual repression inherent in western society . 
  that 's a giant leap . 
  i gave you a very long explanation of why sex questions are particularly an issue yet to prefer to make sweeping statements based on nothing . 
  that 's a logistical issue with the size of the subreddit . 
  sure , but it does provide a brief palate cleanser and allow some room for better topics for a couple of weeks . 
   my theory is that you guys have actually already decided to ban sex topics but are just trying to `` ween '' the sub off of it for fear of backlash . 
  your theory is wrong . 
  i 'm not going to say it will never happen , mostly because the response we got to banning them for a week last time was overwhelmingly positive but this is n't an attempt to `` ween '' everyone off them . 
   we already tried this . 
  do you remember what happened ? 
  the response we received was ** overwhelmingly ** positive with many , many requests for a permanent change . 
  the number of people sending modmail to praise the move was several-fold larger than those complaining and you * always * hear more complaints than praise ( happy people do n't often feel the need to contact you - annoyed people do ) . 
  / r/ideasforaskreddit, 
  it 's tricky but it can be done . 
  my wife and i recently vacuum sealed a bunch of cookies but had a similar problem . 
  the trick is to let it take out as much air as possible before it starts squishing the item . 
  then you use something like a ruler to press down and not let any new air in while you move the bag to the sealing position and seal it . 
  you leave a small amount of air in there but it 's better than nothing and leaves your item in tact . 
  it 's a 2-man job though . 
  it 's so that when pettis inevitably gets hurt , there 's a new co-main . 
  serious question , has there ever been a big man who could make that same play ? 
  he has such a rare combination of talents and it 's really breath-taking to watch sometimes . 
  that 's why i said big man instead of someone his size because lebron instantly came to mind . 
  he plays the role of a traditional 4 whereas lebron is clearly an oversized wing . 
  durant probably has a couple of inches on blake too but i 'm talking about someone who plays the majority of their offense as the screener in a pnr or in the post . 
  hi lifeglimpse , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * sexual topics are temporarily prohibited .

  the one that drives me the most crazy is that scientists are experts in every single type of science as well as incredible engineers . 
  in reality , scientists are * insanely * specialised in a specific subsection of a subfield within a field of science . 
  for example , i study psychology . 
  within psychology , i study social pscyhology and within that i have a specific subfield i know about . 
  sure , i know more about an average layman than social psychology but researchers are extremely specialised .

  honestly , i do . 
  i genuinely try to make the world a better place and while i 'm not perfect , i do try my best . 
  in fact , i donated plasma just today !, 
  i also volunteer at a suicide helpline . 
  i realised a while ago it makes me feel good to help other people and since i do n't have much money , i try to do it in ways i can afford . 
  australia, 
  best - i have incredible access to essentially free healthcare and live in remarkable first world comfort despite not earning a lot of money . 
  my rights are never violated and the poorest/sickest of my country are well taken care of so as few people as possible need to go without food or healthcare ( even though the systems are far from perfect ) . 
  i got an extremely good university education for a small price and my government is secular despite strong lobbying from the christian right . 
  worst - the government is trying ** really ** hard to undo all of that .
