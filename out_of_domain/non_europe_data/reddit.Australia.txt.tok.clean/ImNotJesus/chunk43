  i thought doggy style meant anal too ( until about 15 years old ), 
  also , i thought that a blowjob and a head job were different and based on how far in it went ( ie. , head job was just the head ), 
  edit : also , this is slightly different but i always thought it would be great to be a lesbian because you could always just look at your own boobs in the mirror . 
  excuse me but i think you dropped [ this ] ( http://www.isrealli.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sarcasm01.jpg ), 
  therapy worked for me, 
  `` wait 3 days '' or `` see , i told you i was sick '', 
  edit : or `` counter-terrorists win . '', 
  like 7 snuggies, 
  put pictures of your mother and grandmother all around your workspace . 
  it would be a bitch to pee, 
  i have a great aunt who gives the oddest gifts ( she gave my aunty and cousin 3 lollipops each ) . 
  anyway , for my birthday a couple of years ago she decided to get something personal for me . 
  she knew that i 'd been on a road trip with a friend of mine and we 'd been camping the whole way . 
  she decided the best present to get me was what she called a ` shaving mirror ' . 
  it 's about 2 feet tall and almost entirely glass , perfect for camping . 
  also , her card was the back of a postcard from a cruise she had been on . 
  masturbate, 
  america does n't have the most freedom of any country in the world , you got overtaken a while ago . 
  how did you reattach it ? 
  did the logic go that far ? 
  wait . . you do n't ? 
  well , that did turn out to be true but not for the reasons you thought, 
  how many states can homosexuals get married in ? 
  how many states have true freedom from religion ? 
  how good is your healthcare ? 
  well said, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/i00x3/is_america_the_only_hope_for_being_the_closet_to/c1zrlef ), 
  i have no words, 
  [ here 's a tutorial video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46qkhq7rei4 ), 
  you 're a gay atheist and you think it 's okay that only 5 or 6 states allow equal rights for homosexuals , you get bullied and they teach fucking creationism in schools ? 
  wow . 
  as i said . 
  no words, 
  as someone who worked with many ... yes . 
  some are all out crazy but the creepy ones are the super nice ones . 
  seriously , they 're the nicest people you will ever meet , it 's kind of jarring . 
  a house that has a waterslide going from my bedroom into an indoor pool, 
  have a clap from me, 
  hey everyone , this guy had sex . 
  there you go , saved you the trouble, 
  haha i 'm actually australian . 
  one of the tricks that electricity door-to-door guys use is quoting prices without gst . 
  or ... do your own homework, 
  one day the fair maiden went for a stroll . 
  so ronry and sadry arone, 
  just turned 23 and i 'm really glad i was in a serious relationship for my first time . 
  sex is different in a relationship, 
  you just broke the first rule of fighting game club, 
  do new activities together so you have things to talk about, 
  no , if it 's dying while plugged in it 's fucked, 
  no i genuinely think the chair is homosexual, 
   your suggestion is gay . 
  ftfy, 
  mm bop, 
  that 's the ones that do n't just outright lie or tell them that they 're the supplier and they have no choice, 
  yeh but then they might think i 'm calling the chair a bundle of sticks , which it kind of is , just a homosexual bundle of sticks . 
  in general i 've enjoyed sex much more in a relationship than casual or fwb but my first time i was incredibly nervous and anxious and i 'm really glad that i was with someone i felt comfortable and safe with . 
  most wasted hour ever, 
  then why do you keep inviting me into your bed ? 
  seconded, 
  started studying sports management , had a complete breakdown ( did n't leave the house except for therapy for about 2 years ) . 
  completely turned my life around with said therapy , getting a couple of great sports management jobs ahead of where i should 've been . 
  realised that i would be happy doing sports management but it was n't really me and that i need to go back to uni to study psychology which leads me to where i am today ( about 6 years away from being dr imnotjesus the therapist ) . 
  i just got really annoyed because i went to subway and he made my sub really badly and it was stone cold . 
  then i got more annoyed at myself for not saying anything until i got half way through my sub when it was too late for them to do anything but microwave the whole thing making it even worse . 
  take a downvote for being too apathetic . 
  u mad ? 
  oh like a business degree specifically for sport , so like working in sporting clubs or event management or player management etc, 
  my penis, 
  yes, 
  huh ? 
  marmite is just vegemite with a bunch of sugar added . 
  it 's the opposite way around, 
  you wanked last night and wo n't be ready again tonight ? 
  it takes me less than 2 minutes to be ready for another round . 
  but ... do n't you own her once she marries you ? 
  i thought that 's why i paid the dowry . 
  no because no sane person actually believes in ufos . 
  the only people that make them are nutjobs because the only people that believe it that truly are nutjobs . 
  shh that makes my joke less funny, 
  6 days of no pooping after an all-protein diet and then taking a double dose of an incredibly strong laxative . 
  imagine a fire hydrant . 
  i think a sign saying `` reddit tells me that corporations have too much power '' will convince a lot of people on his suburban street . 
  i would do a really large study on attitudes towards irrational belief ( not saying it is irrational * to * believe but beliefs that are contrary to natural law ) and the correlation with mortality salience and other variables . 
  old acct name or it did n't happen, 
  i only had one first kiss, 
  if you 're going to post that in every new thread i wo n't have anyone to make fun of, 
  have you been getting enough sleep ? 
  are you stressed ? 
  also , it 's highly likely that this is an illusory correlation due to availability bias then confirmed by confirmation bias ( ie. , it 's easy to think of times you forget things , then you get convinced by the idea and notice it everywhere ) . 
  `` that was the joke '' `` the joke '' `` joke '', 
  your sentence a word . 
  signed ,, 
  someone who speaks english, 
  excuse me sir but you seem to have dropped [ this ] ( http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii12/reexpert44/thats_the_joke.jpg?t=1272403278 ), 
  nice try , google salesman, 
  but what if i do n't like learning ? 
  `` i wo n't rape you '', 
  i 'm pretty sure a rapist said this . 
  `` expelli ... '',
