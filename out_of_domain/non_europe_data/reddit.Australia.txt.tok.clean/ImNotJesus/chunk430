  i also love [ joss whedon 's answer to this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyaczojmrhs ), 
  when palmer is the least crazy person in a room ... 
  that 's the problem when small parties/independents hold the balance of power . 
  the few independents helping to make up the minority government last term did n't `` keep the big parties in check '' , they just had a disproportionate amount of bargaining power to get things for their electorate/make themselves look good . 
  the amount of power pup have is completely disproportionate to the number of votes they got , purely by virtue of partisan politics and the way our system works . 
  it 's garbage . 
  he 's saying that while he 's a human who makes mistakes , he would never make that sort of mistake unless there was an issue like not hearing the bell . 
  i 'm sure all 8 fans at the game will enjoy it . 
  all jokes aside , that is fucking cool . 
  if we could get it to project second round picks hinkie would never have to leave the house . 
  protip : put a space before the # to make it work . 
  rest assured that if you 're on the internet and start a sentence with `` am i the only one '' the answer is no . 
  / r/incest, 
  that 's a very good point . 
  i wonder how much of that relates to the type of network he puts his work on . 
  maybe it 's just his style or the networks he 's been on but i 've always felt like that one big flaw in his work is that he always pulls a step short of being really out there and gritty ( except in a few remarkable buffy episodes ) . 
  i wonder what he could do with a show on amc or hbo . 
  that 's depressing then . 
  wow randy has really slimmed down since he retired . 
  also , while there are ** some ** better female roles around now , there were n't exactly many in 1997 when buffy started . 
  i have also heard him praise her as a phenomenal actor , not just for her looks or vulnerability . 
  the idea of hating fat people is so interesting to me . 
  i would guess that it 's related to [ disgust sensitivity/propensity ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0191886906002017 ) but there really is n't much literature that i know of on why a self-harming act like overeating would cause such severe disgust . 
  maybe it 's considered a [ purity violation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_foundations_theory ) but that would be pretty interesting because it 's generally considered that purity/disgust are related to evolved reactions to things that were dangerous on an evolutionary timescale ( incest/food taboos/excretions etc. ), 
  or things involved in ingroup binding/sacredness . 
  i do n't really know why people would show such significant disgust for obese people since , if anything , there were evolutionary pressures to be fatter .

  thank you !, 
  my understanding of body envelope is that it refers to cuts/holes . 
  breaking the seal of the body envelope more than distortions of it . 
  the greens will consistently find themselves on the right side of history . 
  they may never become a major party but i have to believe that if you keep making a hell of a lot of sense people notice after a while . 
  i 'll admit that i definitely misjudged them . 
  hmm interesting . 
  i did a bit of a literature search after that comment and i could only really find one paper on obesity stigma-disgust [ link ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21836644 ) . 
  reality does seem to have a left wing bias does n't it ? 
  same !, 
  i 'm thinking about doing some work in the area but so many projects on the go . 
  what in particular ? 
  i certainly do n't agree with everything they say ( there are big chunks i disagree with ) but they seem to be progressive on a lot more issues than the major parties . 
  you should get some / r/science flair . 
  will do, 
  but it 's this random employee 's fault that i acted like an asshole !, 
  i should be an asshole to teach them a lesson . 
  it represents what * they * think islam is . 
  just as this church represents their beliefs in the way they feel appropriate . 
  why is the penguin dressed up as eugene ? 
  i watched it 4 times trying to work out where the travel was but his footwork was perfect . 
  2 - most defaults have inactive mods that are n't involved in running the sub . 
  we 're concerned ( in the 2 defaults i 'm in with inactives ) that they can rock up out of nowhere and approve something . 
  given that approving something should be a fairly big decision between mods , maybe make a minimum of 3/5 click accept before it goes in . 
  also track which mods agree . 
  3 - i do n't think this is an issue . 
  people always complain . 
  4 - perhaps disable requests from people on the banlist ? 
  that would be a start . 
  maybe also have a minimum account age requirement . 
  5 - as above , 3/5 approvals required and allow the mod group as a whole to request something be removed . 
  6 - perhaps allow it to be toggled so that only mods can put in applications ? 
  i ca n't imagine that any of my subs would approve anything that users did randomly . 
  it would mostly likely be through some sort of process like a mod post . 
  at least allow that as a setting option that each subreddit can choose . 
  i know mine would put it as mod only submission . 
  with the number of users defaults have , it will just be out of control otherwise . 
  it 's possible she has told this story more than once . 
  not even once . 
  i think the force is a bit too much for his thumb to handle . 
  hi mrsundance1498 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 5 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5 - ) and appears to be soap-boxing , or otherwise is a rhetorical or loaded question . 
  you 're welcome to rephrase it and post again in a way more inviting of real discussion . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit&amp;message=my%20post:%20http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2krphr/why_do_americans_have_such_an_obsession_with/ ) . 
  i would personally sit down with her and say something like `` that 's great that you 're questioning things . 
  one of the important parts of growing up is realising that sometimes people are wrong . 
  sometimes people believe things with * all * their might and even though they are really sure in their own mind , they 're still wrong . 
  it can be really tricky to work out who is right sometimes so when we 're not sure , we try to work out who has the best evidence . 
  why do n't we spend a few minutes trying to see who has the best evidence and we can decide who we think is right . '', 
  it 's almost like we should treat women as individuals who have different wants and desires . 
  oh , whoops , i got the narrative wrong . 
  ** all feminists are men haters who secretly hold down women ** . 
  is that better ? 
  against cj miles and solomon hill ? 
  hell , i think he 'd lock them both down . 
  thanks !, 
  no , we still have standards . 
  no memes or low effort content like that but it means you can have non peer-reviewed science education on there . 
  things like nasa photos or ted talks etc. 
  exactly . 
  this stat says that so far he is defending well . 
  no one was calling him bill russell . 
  we literally get it once a week . 
  i have an australia flair instead of a thunder flair ( my favourite team ) because i worry people will think i 'm a `` bandwagon '' fan . 
  the reality is that regular nba was only possible to see in australia from a few years ago and it was the season russ got drafted . 
  i liked going for the young up and coming team so i 've supported the thunder since then . 
  that being said , i watch nba to see players i like . 
  i have 0 desire to watch thunder games at the moment . 
  let 's not forget it took a while for things to click in miami too . 
  this is a completely new team with a completely new coach and he 's not just plugging into some system that was already in place . 
  they have to build everything from the ground up and nba players and coaches are really fucking good . 
  if you do n't have your shit together , you 're going to lose games .
