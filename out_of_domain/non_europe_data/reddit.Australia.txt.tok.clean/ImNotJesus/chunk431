  the more important question is what reason do we have to believe it to be true ? 
  in science , we assume things to be false ( referred to as the null hypothesis ) until there is evidence to show otherwise . 
  sure , it is * possible * that the solar system exists within another system we ca n't detect but the far more parsimonious solution is that it does n't . 
  it is possible that an invisible pink unicorn is sitting in the chair next to me right now but it 's much more likely that there is n't one . 
  i study science . 
   li5 means friendly , simplified and layman-accessible explanations . 
   not responses aimed at literal five year olds ( which can be patronizing ) . 
  fun fact : it actually works . 
  well . 
  it turns out if you focus your system on rehabilitation and not punitive measures , people actually grow and change .

  i recommend [ this book ] ( http://www.samharris.org/free-will ) highly . 
  there 's a reason why all of the reviews are from extremely well respected neuroscientists , philosophers , psychologists and neurologists . 
   does he mention in his book that we can somehow definitively `` re-program '' someone ? 
  the science is n't there yet . 
  we know that certain things help or harm recidivism rates but we certainly ca n't `` fix '' people . 
  in essence , his argument is that they choose to have that genetic make up and set of experiences that lead them to that place as much as we do leading us to being better members of society . 
  he argues for , of course , making sure that dangerous people ca n't harm others but for a move towards understanding as opposed to demonising . 
  this game is going to be fun as hell .

  as far as i know , the work has n't been done . 
  there is a fair bit of research into anti-atheist prejudice , especially in the u.s , because of how generally hated they are as a group . 
  it 's an abstract . 
  the numbers are in the paper . 
  your submission has been removed as it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  the overwhelming evidence in psychology is that spanking is ( a ) extremely damaging to the child and ( b ) not actually an effective strategy . 
  as summed up well by a [ giant meta analysis on the topic ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12081081 ) , the only benefit to spanking is immediate compliance ( i.e. , the kid does the right thing in that moment ) but there is no actual long term behaviour change . 
  all that being said , i could cite 30 different studies and i would still get flooded with `` i was spanked and i turned out okay '' responses . 
  you really , really do n't . 
  [ better ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12081081 ) ? 
  bush was fun at least . 
  abbott is just depressing . 
  constantly two-upping people, 
  probably the fetal position . 
  this is one of the dumbest things i have ever seen . 
  that rally is literally about women wanting to not be victim blamed when ** they are raped ** . 
  look at the sign . 
  if he was raped and then forced to apologise for wearing a suggestive t-shirt , i 'd agree with you . 
  also , no one is saying that he should n't have a right to wear that shirt , it 's just that he pays a price for doing so . 
  some women find it offensive , many others do n't . 
  paying the price of some people disapproving is a choice he made and he 's entitled to make it . 
  you ca n't get angry at people for having opinions . 
  if you do , you are worse than people complaining about his shirt . 
  i mean `` all feminists are horrible '' . 
  shit . 
  i forgot to follow the really dumb circlejerk on this one . 
  edit : you 've got to love reddit . 
  think that rape and internet criticism are n't equivalent ? 
  what a monster . 
  yeah , there 's a pretty big difference between the social cost of people thinking your clothes are inappropriate and blaming women for being raped . 
  apparently . 
  also , apparently all women are exactly the same and that he was `` forced '' to complain as opposed to him realising he did something silly and owning up to it . 
  rest assured that you will join me at the bottom of this post though . 
  dissent is n't appreciated in the circlejerk . 
  we 're supposed to hate all women here . 
  [ here is a giant meta-analysis on the topic ] ( http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/gershoff-2002.pdf ) ( ignore the website it 's posted it , this was published in the # 3 journal in all of psychology ), 
  tl ; dr it does n't just fuck your child up , it does n't actually work . 
  it increases immediate compliance ( they do the thing you say at that moment in time ) but does n't change long-term behaviour .

  not sure if it is the one you are referring to but it 's * the * paper in the field . 
  it 's called cognitive dissonance . 
  there 's a lot of research on hazing and it is effective in ` bringing people closer ' . 
  the eli5 version : the idea is that your brain likes to be sure about things . 
  if you have conflicting information , it tries to justify why one thing is right and the other is wrong ( think confirmation bias ) . 
  if you 're being hurt by people you love/admire your brain has two options , believe that they 're wrong ( extremely psychologically costly when it 's your parents ) or believe that you deserved it and it 's a good thing . 
  the famous study involved two groups of people doing an insanely boring task for 30 minutes . 
  one group was paid a tiny amount of money , the other group were paid well . 
  the group paid a tiny amount reported enjoying the task way more because they were psychologically motivated to believe it . 
  those who got paid well had no reason to be biased because their brain could already understand why they did it . 
  i 'm not telling anyone what to do or not to do but it is important to point out that the overwhelming scientific evidence is that not only does corporal punishment have big negative consequences ( higher rates of mental health , higher levels of aggression , poorer parent-child relationship ) it 's actually a wildly ineffective strategy . 
  in short , increases immediate compliance ( they do the thing you say in that moment ) but does n't change long-term behaviour . 
  i misremembered actually . 
  it 's # 4 . 
  it seems like the challenge that many fields of science face is that good scientific answers are complicated and often require a lot of knowledge to understand . 
  however , pseudoscience thrives on easy answers and intuitively appealing logic . 
  what do you think we should be doing to try and compensate for this obvious disadvantage in the marketplace of ideas ? 
  you can do that through res . 
  more than a feature , i want reddit to make a much bigger effort to increase standards . 
  this means getting rid of the more disgusting subreddits around ( not naming names - do n't want to give them free press ) and taking a stand against the rampant racism/misogyny etc. 
  at the end of the day , i care way more about the right of someone to enjoy a harassment free reddit experience than i do the right of some asshole spout hatred everywhere . 
  from my ( very layman ) understanding . 
  it makes a lot more sense to have people load the res features on their individual computers instead of incorporation it to reduce the average page size .
