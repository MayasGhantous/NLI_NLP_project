  if it makes you feel better i hated myself as i posted it . 
  i really do n't understand why there is n't just a non-politician speaker . 
  surely some unaffiliated person can be trained to do that role pretty easily and it would make it slightly less farcical . 
  your submission was removed from iama because you are asking for upvotes . 
  this is against reddit 's site-wide rules . 
  in addition , doing an ama about being the writer of a blog does n't qualify you for an ama . 
  you would need to post it on / r/casualiama . 
  to be clear for those who did n't read the article : he 's saying that idiots who were training like animals on roids are still training the same way and are now getting hurt . 
  the anti-circlejerk . 
  it has been for a long time so i do n't know if we can call it a trend but circlejerking about how ** other ** people on reddit constantly circlejerk is right up there . 
  anywhere . 
  calling out the circlejerk gets you far more upvotes than circlejerking yourself . 
  fw : fw : re : fw : re : fw : fw, 
  wow that / u/imnotjesus guy is smart . 
  a wet brine should n't affect your bark but if you want to be sure , just [ dry brine ] ( http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/dry_brining.html ), 
  it would have been interesting to have included another experimental condition . 
  if the idea is that war metaphors reduce preventative behaviours by essentially priming an alternative conceptualization , it would be more compelling if they had another set of metaphors that increased preventative behaviours . 
  if it 's just metaphor v no metaphor , as it currently is , you can still wonder if the effect is being driven by the use of metaphor itself ( perhaps more visual explanations increase fear and therefore disable action ? ), 
  as opposed to the specific * type * of metaphor . 
  either way , this is still really cool . 
  i 'd just love to see this built on a bit . 
  verified, 
  i hate it when i stand on the board room table at work and someone looks up my skirt . 
  so inappropriate . 
  knowing what you know , would/do you allow your children to play sports with regular head impacts ? 
  i 'm starting to believe he 's some kind of colbert-esque character . 
  you ca n't make this shit up, 
  wait , what ? 
  the comments here are insane . 
  you ca n't just punch someone . 
  the security guard absolutely did the right thing there . 
  this is n't a black/white thing , this is a do n't punch people in a shopping mall thing . 
  this is probably just a result of not enough of them seeing the savings in their energy bills yet . 
  leading the league in points and per . 
  his lead is even bigger if you consider that his only game under 20 points was the one where he got injured . 
  can someone smarter than me show me kemba 's numbers with/without lance playing ? 
  so it looks like they did this to pick up tarik black . 
  smart move , black has serious potential . 
  this is an old , old [ spike milligan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spike_milligan#death ) gag . 
  still funny but credit where credit is due . 
   and have a / oos macro to resync your game if you start to desync, 
  can you please explain what this is . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks, 
  thanks, 
  can someone explain to me what this is ? 
  you remind me of [ this xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/atheists.png ), 
  it 's really heartwarming to know that when the really big issues come up both sides can look across the bench and act for the greater ~ ~ greed ~ ~ good . 
  i 'm still pretty new but why do some people get acro without phase acro ? 
  is n't it awesome ? 
  any voltaxic build, 
  taken from jack slack 's [ awesome article ] ( http://fightland.vice.com/blog/mike-tyson-the-panic-the-slip-and-the-counter ) on tyson . 
  do n't forget hard screens . 
  you can easily get 4:1 in softcore currently . 
  i have this sort of flicker strike spam build with an oro 's and not special gear and just a few + ignite items . 
  it 's incredibly easy to keep up the frenzy charges . 
  immensely fun and silly to play . 
  ah , right , yeah . 
  do it with an oro 's - more damage and you can get a 5l for 2/3ex . 
  oro 's got a big buff so if you still have the legacy version ( 20 % extra damage taken ) you should divine it . 
  exactly . 
  if it was a 4l i 'd just buy a new one . 
  yeah why would anyone want to talk about or share their thoughts on one of the best individual stretches in recent times ? 
  it 's way more fun to be snarky and negative . 
  as you said , there are a hell of a lot of different build options out there . 
  what sort of thing do you like playing ? 
  yeah , basically it means you ca n't get reductions from * both * mitigations . 
  you 're taking the damage as chaos * instead * of elemental . 
  well it gives a lot of other benefits . 
  you may think it 's worth the payoff and it could be for some builds . 
  the thing to look at is the keywords . 
  it will affect any damage that has the aoe keyword . 
  if you 're not sure , the wiki often explains it - http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/poison_arrow, 
  i really want to know the collective record of all teams the game after firing a head coach . 
  or ( the lakers ) get unlucky and it 's the 6th pick this year . 
  i meant * the lakers * get unlucky . 
  machida shogun ? 
  i really hate it when people are good at the sport i like . 
  they should be deliberately worse to make it `` more exciting '' . 
  well , you can make an argument that making statements of fact about groups based on the sexual preference is vilification . 
  if the ad made the claim that x ethnic group had lower iqs than y ethnic group and should therefore be denied rights would you consider that vilification ? 
  eh , i think censorship is overrated honestly when you 're talking about hate speech . 
  i get the whole `` who decides '' argument but at the end of the day , hate speech hurts people . 
   should therefore be denied rights, 
  would still make the ad racist . 
  i run an oro 's flicker strike and find that multistrike has a really useful unintended benefit in that it makes me hit lots of different packs in quick succession . 
  while the burn is n't as high as it would be without it , the burn is still very damaging and between it and splash , packs just go down . 
  i 've never found dps to be a problem . 
  it 's an interesting idea but would probably need some rebalancing . 
  that being said , some pretty fun uniques would be end-game viable . 
  i 'd love to do a dual ungil 's build with reasonable damage . 
  changing mine to 4 saved my poe experience . 
  my laptop is made out of 1980s soviet potatoes . 
   i do n't see it as convenient unless ggg finally grow balls and turn physical leech nodes into global leech ones, 
  yeah we definitely need more ways to advantage casters over melee . 
  hmm , i 'm really tall so i should probably just lean forward throwing uppercuts since they have better range than normal uppercuts . 
  either that or just pull guard . 
  shit a few years ago he was locked in at # 2 . 
  [ full paper ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/05/1421692112.full.pdf+html ), 
  that depends on whether you 're referring to suicide or euthanasia .
