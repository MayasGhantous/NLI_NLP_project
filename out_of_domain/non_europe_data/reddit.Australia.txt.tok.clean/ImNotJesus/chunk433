  euthanasia is a problematic thing to regulate but it 's largely being held back by conservatism , it 's a matter of time . 
  if you 're referring to suicide , the idea is that if someone is so distressed as to be wanting to take their own life , they almost certainly are n't capable of making an irreversible decision like that . 
  deep distress like that clouds thinking and there are many , many people who have taken serious attempts at their own life only to live a long and happy life afterwards . 
  more importantly , you asking this question makes me wonder if you are yourself considering suicide at the moment . 
  was this a passing thought in the shower or are you having regular suicidal thoughts ? 
  5 % flee obviously, 
  there really is n't a counter to the problem of hard solipsism and you ca n't * prove * that your experience is real . 
  that being said , like the issue of whether free will is an illusion or not , the perception that our existence is real is fundamentally identical to it not being real so it does n't actually matter . 
  you should show him [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gedacidvj6i ) . 
  a kiai master offered $ 5000 to any mma fighter who could beat him since he was impervious to non-chi attacks . 
  it did n't end well for him . 
  yeah , they should learn to enjoy sport the exact way you think that she should . 
  i thought this was an interesting idea . 
  not even tony is deluded enough to think he is going to win an election called soon . 
  huge , huge congratulations to new zealand who absolutely terrified me before this game . 
  international odi is going to be insanely fun for the next while . 
  so many of the top teams are stacked with young talent . 
  we 've always taken cricket leadership [ from our pms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o8by05rtmy ), 
  embarrassing . 
  have some class dude . 
  devs tried to nerf australia by buffing india , south africa and new zealand . 
  need another buff imo, 
  early pressure is so hard to overcome because it 's such a momentum sport . 
  once you lose early wickets , the run rate drops and there 's more and more pressure . 
  the recovery was excellent but lost wickets at the wrong time consistently . 
  a + bowling by australia . 
  too good on the day . 
  has to be . 
  his numbers were just obscene . 
  real shame he did n't get to hit the winning runs but what a performance . 
  would be pretty insane with a crit mace build and endurance charge on melee stun . 
  in what way ? 
  2h hype, 
  unarmed skill or unique ? 
  seems kind of harsh to finally offer something new to unarmed builds only to make it a facebreaker alternative instead of something for another slot . 
  edit : yay, 
  sick, 
  it 's not corrupt because * that 's their job * . 
  he was implying that they are necessarily corrupt because they are motivated by money which is a silly argument when their job is to make money . 
  if he wants to claim that they are corrupt , he would need to show evidence of that . 
  dat ambiguous use of resign, 
  durant is 26 . 
  ibaka is 25 . 
  russ is 26 . 
  they can easily be an ** elite ** team for the next 5 years and will probably have the chance to add another high level talent when the cap jumps . 
  why jump ship to play on a worse team ? 
  i know this is the internet but it is possible for people to agree with you . 
  do you think lebron leaves if he can only go to inferior teams though ? 
  he left because mo williams was his best teammate in 7 years . 
   btw , your doctor prescribes things with same level of evidence as homeopathy but no one bats an eye kind about those . 
  could not be more wrong . 
  oh well if google says it ... 
  so if i ran those two scales as ivs ( with some other demographics ) on a normally distributed dv , it would still be robust ? 
  sorry maybe that 's the wrong choice of words - i was rushing . 
  what i want to know is if i run a multiple regression with one positively skewed variable and one negatively skewed variable as well as a few other variables , will the skew of those two variables make the analysis inaccurate ? 
  is there any need to transform or use nonparamentric testing ? 
  awesome . 
  thanks, 
  so your first instinct is to be an asshole to random , friendly people you do n't know for no particular reason ? 
  my professional advice is that you have a good look at yourself . 
  how would you recommend transforming ? 
  either . 
  that 's one of the big benefits . 
  hi bkipp23 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience .

  yeah but what if you got elected on a campaign of `` labor wasted all our fuel '' and are committed to pretending that you ca n't add any more . 
  as mods you have literally zero tools to detect brigading other than assuming that anyone who posts in both is in fact brigading . 
  if you believe it to be happening , you should inform the admins . 
  if you just want to ban people from / r/fatpeoplehate because they 're terrible , terrible people , that 's totally different but do n't pretend that it 's about brigading . 
  stat based build hype . 
  more ways to build characters , more fun . 
  i hope so . 
  base stats do n't play a big enough role at this stage . 
  wow , did n't know that . 
  i 'm extremely hyped for this staff that will be way too expensive for me . 
  for those asking about support gems :, 
   while this is the first unique that grants a skill you ca n't otherwise get , it 's not the first one that grants a skill - see jaws of agony , which grants bear trap . 
  this works exactly the same way . 
  the skill will be supported by any applicable support gems socketed into the item . 
  there are also several corrupted implicit mods that cause items to grant skills in exactly the same way . 
  this is n't quite as new or unique as you seem to think , at least in terms of granting a skill from an item - only in the fact that this skill itself is a new one , which doens ' t affect any of the mechanics of how items from skills work . 
  again , this works exactly like the existing item that already grants a skill . 
  empower , like enlighten and enhance , explicitly only apply their effects to skill gems - unlike other supports , they affect things that are properties of the gem , not the skill it grants . 
  since this item , and jaws of agony before it , grant a skill without a gem , those gem-only supports can not apply to the granted skills . 
  from mark_ggg on the forums, 
  i do n't think it looks like a golem and you can see lightning in the background . 
  i think it 's something else . 
  also good for a doon build . 
  honestly , i 've never heard a cogent argument for why homeopathy should be legal . 
  at * best * it 's negligently untrained people posing as medical professionals , at * worst * it 's maliciously motivated charlatans . 
  either way , in all fields * except * for medicine , we ensure that people make products that actually work . 
  if i sell you a couch that ca n't hold your weight , you 're entitled to a refund . 
  yet for some reason in medicine it 's okay to sell things that we know do n't perform their most basic function ? 
  that 's insane . 
  let me put it this way , would anyone ever go to a medical professional if they ** knew ** that the treatment they were getting was n't going to work ? 
  like they really knew with 100 % certainty ? 
  of course not . 
  if that 's true , the only people that see homeopaths are people being misled .
