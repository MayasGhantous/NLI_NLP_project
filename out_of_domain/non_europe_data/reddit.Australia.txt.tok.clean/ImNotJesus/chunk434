  seriously , everything you would ever want to know about the game is in the wiki but you need to just fuck around and try things to know what to look up . 
   a lot of homeopathy is based ( very , liberally and loosely ) on scientific data . 
  because it 's so hard and expensive to disprove that green tea extract helps prevent cancer , there is no way of knowing with 100 % certainty that ( most ) homeopathy is bunk . 
  that 's not homeopathy , i think you 're thinking of naturopathy ( i also think that the onus should be on the one making the claim to prove efficacy but that 's a whole other issue ) . 
  i used homeopathy as an example because it flies in the face of basic laws of physics so it 's very easy to argue against . 
  both of you , honestly . 
  second *, 
  it 's not cheap but smokers are * way * more expensive here . 
  as a gauge , an $ 800 yoder would cost me about $ 3,000 so it 's still cheaper to pay for shipping myself . 
  some of the egg-style are n't so bad here but i think i really want a cabinet or off-set . 
  interesting . 
  any idea how i would go about finding someone capable of doing it ? 
  i have n't looked at getting one made yet since it did n't occur to me as an idea until jjknarf suggested it . 
  as for purchasing a smoker , i 've just been looking at retail shops within australia that sell smokers . 
  you can only get very specific makes and models here and many of them are really expensive . 
  i 'm not really interested in a bradley , i want good old fashioned charcoal and wood . 
  irony would be writing an entire song about irony without listing anything ironic . 
  thanks !, 
  honestly , just more build enabling gems/jewels/uniques . 
  making builds is the best part of the game to me so anything bringing in new options is awesome . 
  it seems like traps/totems are an awesome way to go with the new staff because it eliminates the need to actually be in the middle of a pack if you 're a caster . 
  i 'm building an rf doon strength based caster , do you think it 's worth sinking 5/6 points to get to the node for mom ? 
  i assumed no but since i 'm close-ish wanted another opinion . 
  aiming for ~ 1k strength but wo n't have amazing armor/evasion due to using a few low levels uniques . 
  as an alternative , i was thinking of trying to get more block from the tree . 
  you do n't pay for the education , you pay for the peers . 
  as someone who went to both public and private schools , i plan to send my kids to private , even with the knowledge that there is no academic difference . 
  ironic by alanis morrisette , at first glance , appears to be a song by someone who does n't know the meaning of the word irony . 
  however , what could possibly be more ironic than writing a song about irony and not listing anything ironic ? 
  it 's actually genius . 
  parking around there is also a nightmare and really expensive . 
  but why waste money on infrastructure when you could build another toll road ? 
  next they 'll be saying that we do n't need more coal plants . 
  this is luancy !, 
  i think compassion * should * be our first response to people who end up on such dark paths . 
  no one steals , murders , commits terrorism , takes really hard drugs etc. 
  because they 're happy , healthy and had all of the right opportunities in life . 
  that 's not to say that agency does n't matter but it 's worth considering there 's much more to the story than good vs evil even though it 's an easy way to think of the world . 
  next they 'll force us to consume dihydrogen monoxide . 
  the chemical horror, 
  len had only really just started playing consistent minutes too and he 's a big difference maker on defence . 
  it will be easier to know how you can change your build if you post a link to your current skill tree . 
  depending on what you have chosen it will make changing easier/harder . 
  worth pointing out that this needle in a haystack is n't even someone who thinks climate change is n't real . 
  bjorn lomborg is basically just a ~ ~ n economist ~ ~ political scientist who thinks that the ** economic ** impact of climate change is n't that bad when modeled ( [ awesome article that explains it and why it 's fucking stupid ] ( https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2015/april/1427806800/richard-denniss/spreadsheets-power ) ), 
  of all of the shitty , disgusting things that this government has done , this is actually one of the worst . 
  it 's one thing for a government to take a wrong stance on a scientific issue ( infuriating and troubling ) but it 's a ** whole new level ** to defund multiple organisations doing good work ( e.g. , climate council and csiro ) and spend money on ** propaganda ** to support that wrong position . 
  that 's exactly what this is . 
  they 're spending 4 million dollars on a propaganda machine . 
  it 's like them setting up a `` refugee research group '' headed up by a neo-nazi . 
  or just pick the 1 or 2 that agree with what they already wanted to do . 
  how ? 
  where ? 
  i 'm trying to get a 100kg smoker shipped down and most quotes are nearly 2 grand . 
  with all of these new curse items , i 'm guessing they 're going to add a few new curses in . 
  tl ; dr : just because i come across as an insane stalker does n't mean that you should n't give me a chance . 
  perfect / r/niceguys material, 
  wow , you 're a post rape victim now . 
  i see how it is . 
  for the record , i 'm not trying to hurt you . 
  but whatever ttyl . 
  but i 'm such a '' [ nice guy ] ( / r/niceguys ) '', 
  i wonder if these stack . 
  i really hope the call ended with pop saying `` count the rings bitch '' and hanging up . 
  psychologist - people pretty much misunderstand most of what psychology is about . 
  in fact , one of the first thing i have to tell first year students is `` hey , this is actually a science '' because they do n't expect it . 
  they think it 's like high school psychology where they chatted about freud . 
  there are some annoying pop-culture ideas that get bandied about like the `` we only use 10 % of our brain '' thing . 
  which , if you know the tiniest bit of information about the brain , makes literally no sense . 
  for one , only a very small part of our brain is devoted to thinking . 
  the vast majority processes sensory input and controls bodily functions . 
  having too many electrical impulses does actually exist though , it 's called a seizure and is generally considered not a fun thing . 
  probably much worse than that though is all of the damaging beliefs around mental illness . 
  the idea that people are `` weak '' or are personally failing by becoming mentally ill stops a lot of people who need help from getting it . 
  you are no more responsible for suffering from a depression than you are catching a cold and you should feel no more embarrassed visiting a psychologist than you do a doctor . 
  i think we 're headed in the right direction but there 's still a hell of a lot of stigma around mental illness . 
  it 's kind of like saying `` we only use one key at a time when we type . 
  if we could mash the entire keyboard at the same time , we could type much faster . '', 
  like , sure , more would happen but i doubt you 'd think that you were typing better . 
  ask him to explain what a toxin is . 
  for a second i thought i found deepak chopra 's reddit username but you did n't misuse the word quantum 16 times . 
  to be fair , it 's not incorrect to use the word theory in that way to describe a hunch . 
  it 's just unfortunate that it also means something difference in science . 
  oh wow , this will be great for rf bui ... nevermind . 
  edit : it actually looks like it is if you have enough fire resist . 
  cool !, 
  it sounds like either ( a ) she 's not explaining it to you very well or ( b ) she 's not understanding it very well because it most definitely is a science and is taught like one at every respected university around the world . 
  i would be surprised if she 's doing any less than 3 statistics subjects . 
  you can objectively measure subjective criteria . 
  then i 'll sue you . 
  i 'm a professional quote maker and demand compensation . 
  serpent will affect spells , blunt trauma wo n't . 
  i agree in general ** but ** you would hope that anyone doing a science-based phd would have basic science literacy skills . 
  i 'm not an expert in biomedical sciences but i 'm sure that i 'm more capable than an average person off the street at discerning good information from bad . 
  neither is a spell . 
  it 's always so surprising to see a misogynistic asshole is also ignorant about other things . 
  it more just saddened me . 
  how do you do an entire movie with a premise centred on psychology/neuroscience but never speak to anyone who has completed a first year course on either ? 
  i really do think that this is actually a whole new level from this government . 
  i 've disagreed with a lot of what they 've done so far but at least i can understand it .
