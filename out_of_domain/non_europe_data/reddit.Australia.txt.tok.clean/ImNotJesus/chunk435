  a `` fuck the poor '' economic position mixed with harsh immigration policies , not what i would do but hey , that 's what people voted for . 
  sure , it 's kind of ludicrous that the government actually takes a stance on questions of science but i get that they have to make economic decisions and decided to bet on coal for some bizarre reason , i get it . 
  but this , this is spending $ 4 million on ** propaganda ** to support a dumb decision all under the guise of trying to appear balanced . 
  it 's a whole new level of scumbaggery . 
  this is like having a human rights of refugees council set up and then having it lead by a group of neo-nazis . 
  and to those who say that he 's not a climate denialist and just thinks we should spend money on other things , do n't think for a second that this ** political scientist ** ( not an economist ) is n't just squeezing data to like exactly how he wants it . 
  there was a phenomenal article that everyone should read in the monthly called [ spreadsheets of power : how economic modelling is used to circumvent democracy and shut down debate ] ( https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2015/april/1427806800/richard-denniss/spreadsheets-power ) . 
   most economic modellers do not assume that all human lives are equal . 
  bjorn lomborg , for example , one of the world 's most famous climate sceptics , uses modelling that assumes the lives of people in developing countries are worth a lot less than the lives of australians or americans . 
  while the us declaration of independence may declare that all men are created equal , most economic models assume that all men ( and women ) are worth a figure based on the gdp per capita of their country . 
  man , that looks fun as hell to play . 
  at any cut off people would be pissed . 
  you 're just annoyed because it 's you . 
  stop being so entitled . 
  mastercrafted jewels are going to be ** very ** interesting and powerful . 
  i think that besides a couple of build defining uniques , rares are going to be way more powerful . 
  you would hate someone just because they do n't want to see you romantically ? 
  i ca n't imagine why they 're not interested , you seem like such a [ nice guy ] ( / r/niceguys ) . 
  as an example , in the 20th century , you had a 3 % chance to die from violence despite 2 world wars and people living longer/improving medicine . 
  historically , that number was ** 15 % ** . 
  the constant flood of information we receive certainly makes it seem like the world is dangerous but it 's by far the safest world ( for humans ) that has ever existed . 
  this one is a bit different to a lot of the others i see on here . 
  i do n't feel like the point of what he 's saying is `` look at how smart i am '' , i think this is just someone who has no social awareness . 
  i do n't * think * he 's trying to impress people here . 
  i have a pair but ca n't sell them for the life of me ( in standard ), 
  two green , two red, 
  apparently he plans to celebrate by getting a start on his 2016 tax return . 
  finals kawhi is approaching . 
  how does the depth of the earthquake affect things ? 
  as a thunder fan , ** terrifying ** . 
  as a basketball fan ? 
  i could watch 5 years of a kawhi/aldridge combo . 
  i ca n't tell if i 'm on / r/niceguys or / r/iamverysmart, 
  why reduced duration ? 
  so you get the same number of bolts coming down but spread over a shorter time span ? 
  wait , sorry , i 'm really confused by that answer . 
  let 's say that you normally get 10 bolts every 10 seconds . 
  if you get a reduced duration gem that makes it last for 8 seconds , do you now get 8 bolts every 8 seconds or 10 bolts every 8 seconds ? 
  thanks !, 
  i made a somewhat obscure reference with no context and now feel superior to people who did n't get my reference . 
  yes , what can one do indeed . 
  it does n't * have * to be age . 
  it can be any sort of status really . 
  it 's just someone 's equal . 
  eh , i never learned about it in school . 
  i only know the reference because it 's about 5 % of all askreddit questions . 
  pretty dark for 5th graders is n't it ? 
  breaking news : guy who gets hit in the head for a living not very good at science and critical thinking . 
  i totally agree though . 
  this is just totally reckless and dangerous . 
  pretty tough to fight from an iron lung . 
  i also added six inches since that video . 
  so what steps did you take to help you understand the scientific literature ? 
  or did you just ask a few friends who you knew were pro-cannabis to give you some talking points ? 
  as a nation , you ca n't act like you do n't care about the human rights of others but then expect other countries to give a shit when we say you should respect our people 's human rights . 
  oh , i thought your `` seems valid '' was sarcastic . 
  it does seem like we agree . 
  [ a similarly themed conversation article on this idea ] ( https://theconversation.com/hard-line-on-refugees-undermines-principled-opposition-to-execution-40953 ) . 
  if i did n't guess the 90 's chicago bulls can i still go watch space jam ? 
  even though cerrone v khabib is a more meaningful fight , this could be a more exciting fight . 
  i really think the key to using this staff is adding trap . 
  the other , often overlooked part , is that kicks to a ground opponent will often happen in the space between a guy going out and a ref stopping it . 
  jumping on top of a guy and punching him is bad but having a guy 's head getting stomped when he 's already out ? 
  recipe for ** disaster ** . 
  there 's also a very easy fix to the putting your hand down to stop a knee tactic - change the definition of standing so that having more than 50 % of both feet on the ground is considered standing . 
  now you can ** try ** to play that game by fucking with your own balance but it would essentially stop the strategy . 
  i ** really ** do n't agree with this logic at all . 
  i love how the pro-hack-a crowd have totally reframed this discussion as `` why are we protecting bad free throw shooters ? '', 
  instead of what it should be : why are we protecting people abusing the intention of rules ? 
  the whole point of getting free throws when you 're in the ** bonus ** is that it 's supposed to advantage that team . 
  having the other team shoot free throws after every foul is a ** punishment ** for fouling too often . 
  if the rule is being exploited such that it 's * not * advantaging the the correct team then it 's a failing of the rule , not the bad free throw shooter . 
  simply fix the rule . 
  i think either will do a good job but i agree that ludlam may be better . 
  i think he has just a bit more charisma and ability to really capture people 's attention . 
  either way , it 's pretty exciting to see a third party that is gaining power being run by young , progressive people . 
  i certainly do n't agree with everything they do but they seem to be right about a hell of a lot more than the two majors . 
  you do n't know nothing / u/adelaidecrowjonsnow, 
  look at me mum , i 'm so edgy !, 
  synergy with maligaro 's lens + necromantic aegis ? 
  cwdt build with maligaro 's to recover the lost health . 
  or just use maligaro 's lens and necro aegis . 
  get the health back instantly, 
  wait , women have independent thoughts and feelings ? 
  i thought they were receptacles that you trick into letting you have sex with them by being really nice . 
  i would n't say they 're both * great * reasons . 
  to be fair , i * was * wondering if it 's in finance . 
  because the only reason people do n't cheat in relationships is fear of getting caught . 
  no one * actually * has any sense of integrity or care about agreements within their relationship . 
  [ i ca n't believe their amazing campaign strategy did n't work ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bgoivoq.png ), 
  the resist is n't redundant . 
  it 's not that hard to cap out resists but getting an extra 10 for free either makes your gear cheaper or easier to get other bonuses . 
  very key point . 
   the president of the un 's sub-committee on torture prevention , malcom evans , is urging for the provision ** after inspecting the centre this week . 
  ** ( emphasis mine ), 
  the torture guy saw what was happening there * himself * and said it 's not okay . 
  i ca n't believe you passed up a `` great guy '' like him . 
  why are they yelling at me ? 
  ** minor ** ?? 
  taking away reduced mana on auras is one of the biggest meta changes ever ( if it stays like this until expansion ) .
