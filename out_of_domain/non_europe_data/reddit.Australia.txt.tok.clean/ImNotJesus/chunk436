  edit : that 's not to say it 's necessarily a bad change , just a big one . 
  i do n't think it 's that bad an idea really . 
  what ggg seem to be trying to move away from is anything that is required for * all * builds . 
  my concern is that all this will do is make stacking auras possible for only the wealthier players ( since enlighten is so much rarer ) . 
  maybe it will at least create a bigger opportunity cost to the always correct decision of using reduced mana on an aura . 
  edit 2 : 60 % auras are now 50 % when they were 45 % with a lvl16 rm gem . 
  edit 3 : looks like they made rm stronger as well to make it appealing to use on skills . 
  so they 're just making stacking auras insanely expensive . 
  i doubt they 'll adjust them * that * much . 
  i 'd bet that they 'll drop each a little bit but not as much as a rm gem . 
  why would it have an increased mana multiplier if it does n't do anything else ? 
  i 'm starting to believe that this entire government is just a colbert-esque satire . 
  i 'd take 39 % reduced over 25 % less in most cases i think . 
  exactly , this is about truthiness . 
  not limited to 1 either . 
  even if there are n't massively convenient spots for it , getting bonus flat lightning for voltaxic is awesome . 
  say what you want about doc the gm but doc the coach at least appears from the outside to manage the situation very well . 
  cute moment . 
  it 's a conspiracy when it 's against my team and just part of the game when it favours us . 
  [ here 's the full video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1eikhotxtk ), 
  there 's more context to this . 
  there was a very famous australian bowler ( pitcher ) in the 80s/90s named [ merv hughes ] ( http://www.sportphotogallery.com/content/images/products/sports/1037340b/main/1037340b-product.jpg ) and this was kind of his thing . 
  for an aussie crowd to join in as an english player does was really fun . 
  here 's a little bit of [ merv stretching ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atvuibotw54 ), 
  which is what it should be with a review system . 
  in cricket , for example , they have the opportunity to review plays and the benefit of the doubt always goes to the original call . 
  exactly . 
  this sub is fun when it 's making for of people who just took their first intro philosophy class but a group of mostly adults making fun of a little kid is just sad . 
  yeah , fuck me for trying to provide context to people who do n't understand cricket . 
  in your endo . . wait . 
  amazing shot but what a fucking mess of a finish with that review ( edit : to be clear it was a mess because of the implications , not that it was the wrong decision ) . 
  ** clear ** foul on noah there too . 
  ~ ~ a lot of bad calls both ways in the last quarter really ~ ~ clearly a conspiracy against [ your team name here ] . 
  it was n't the heaviest contact ever but you have to consider context . 
  noah jumping into him made it impossible for him to take a shot at the basket . 
  you have to call it . 
  it 's actually not because mayweather 's style requires immense skill and physical talent to be that good at judging and exploiting distance . 
  hacking requires 0 skill . 
  i just do n't know how anyone can support this garbage . 
  i love how the pro-hack-a crowd have totally reframed this discussion as `` why are we protecting bad free throw shooters ? '', 
  instead of what it should be : why are we protecting people abusing the intention of rules ? 
  the whole point of getting free throws when you 're in the ** bonus ** is that it 's supposed to advantage that team . 
  having the other team shoot free throws after every foul is a ** punishment ** for fouling too often . 
  if the rule is being exploited such that one team is actively avoiding playing basketball and it 's * not * advantaging the the correct team then it 's a failing of the rule , not the bad free throw shooter . 
  we 've already decided we do n't want this stuff to decide games in the last 2 minutes , why not the other 46 ? 
  simply fix the rule . 
  if we take out hand checking , it just rewards guys who ca n't drive while being pushed in the hip . 
  ** it 's not even working ** . 
  that 's the worst part . 
  clippers scored 60 in the first half . 
  they said during the game that when teams hack , the clippers record is 18-2 . 
  or , do n't ruin the game with a dumb rule exploitation . 
  yeah , but adding dribbling just rewarded players who could n't pass as well . 
  [ this ? 
   if you change the rules , then no one in the nba 10 years from now will know how to shoot free throws . 
  but there 's only 2-3 months left in the beta , what if they do n't balance [ my specific build ] that is now totally broken and unusable based on this [ new gem/change/rebalance ] ? 
  right ... but why would the defensive team do it unless they thought it gave them an advantage ? 
  right but my whole point is that 's the reaction to * every * change . 
  just wait until you see everything and it 's all finalised before making massive declarations . 
  [ this should be a good place to start ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppzrosk8tu8 ), 
  ooo sick burn . 
  you really showed that guy asking for help in a friendly way . 
  so maybe like a ground slam-style attack ( but in a ring ) with a cold conversion . 
  of all of the things that did n't happen , this is the one that the most did n't happen . 
  dude . 
  that has his fucking phone number in it . 
  delete your comment . 
  it just keeps going !, 
  they terk our jerbs, 
  you 're not even australian . 
  stop stalking me . 
  i was preparing to ron swanson gif war you but that 's honestly the best gif use i 've ever seen . 
   i believe we are in danger of being swamped by asians . 
  \\ - pauline hanson, 
  seriously . 
  how paralysed by all those feints his opponent was is as impressive as that kick . 
  a couple of sloppy things here and there but that 's some pretty nice technique for a 21 year old . 
  exactly . 
  if you change the rules to help those who ca n't drive you just discourage people from learning how to penetrate . 
  nothing but impressed with daniel andrews so far . 
  also did an impromtu ama in the comments section . 
  you mean they 're too busy drowning in pussy right ? 
  ** guys !, 
  guys !, 
  i just wanted to let you know that i do n't want to be seen commenting on this post . 
  i ca n't risk anyone knowing that i read iamverysmart posts . 
  there 's literally no other way than making a comment that i do n't want to comment so please just ignore this comment and for the love of god do n't tell any college admissions people ** . 
  tl ; dr i pretended to be a friend to `` stupid fucking bitches '' but they never let me redeem my be nice 8 times and get a free handjob card . 
  you would be angry too if you were [ le ] terally forced to be someone 's emotional tampon and they never even rewarded you with sex . 
  he 's so good to his mother and she wo n't even jerk him off in the bath like in those videos he likes . 
  yeah , basketball is all about broken bones and concussions , not this pussy scoring and playing proper defense stuff . 
  no because basketball is too soft . 
  why try to block a shot when you can throw a haymaker . 
  exactly , because basketball is too soft , just like you said . 
  if it was as tough as it should be , mirotic could have just punched him and taken the ball . 
  well , the thing you 're not getting is , why would anyone want to have a close personal connection with someone they care about ? 
  obviously the devious woman is forcing him to do the horrible , horrible thing of caring about someone else and communicating with them . 
  only fucking redditors could take a stance against harassment as an attack on free speech . 
  also , [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ) . 
  seriously .
