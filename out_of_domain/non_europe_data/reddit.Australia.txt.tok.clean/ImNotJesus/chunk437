  if you ca n't enjoy a website without being an asshole to other people just grow up . 
  because you 're being facetious and i 'm clearly just disagreeing with you . 
  by no reasonable person 's standard is what either of us doing harassment . 
  you probably need to clean it better then . 
  here 's the thing i do n't get about this logic . 
  let 's just assume that this is actually true ( it 's clearly not but for the sake of argument ) and put aside all of the insane `` i earned sex '' friendzone stuff . 
  this just implies that the only reason there is to be a gentleman is as a mating strategy . 
  first , apparently there is no intrinsic value in being a good person because that 's how you want to see yourself . 
  fine . 
  but instead of seeing women who ` want to be treated badly ' and thinking `` wow we 're a really bad match for each other , i should try to meet someone who matches my personality better '' i should instead change how i relate to the world because my only sense of value is how many women will agree to touch my penis . 
  if you actually saw a woman who ` wanted to be treated like shit ' would n't that be a fucking huge bullet dodged by not being with her ? 
   if your life leech rate is 4 % , and your maximum life leech rate is 20 % , then you only need enough damage for your leech effects to span the time between 5 hits in order to cap against one target , which could be achievable depending on tuning . 
  sure . 
  but that 's still more hazardous in most cases . 
  number 4 is likely to be a point guard ( mudiay or russell ) and he does n't want to risk anyone who might take a jump shot . 
  he ca n't shoot jump shots so he fits phil 's philosophy perfectly . 
  thanks for taking the time to come and talk to us . 
  it seems like the one of the many issues that underlie p-hacking is the that it 's virtually impossible to publish null results . 
  while we all want to believe that we 're as cognizant of bias as possible , it 's just impossible not to have some bias in interpretation when looking at work you have spent significant time and effort on when the alternatives are ( a ) get published , further your career and opportunities for future funding or ( b ) leave your data in the broken wasteland of a folder on your desktop . 
  while it certainly wo n't fix the problem ( because scientists will always be biased towards finding a result - you would n't be running a study unless you believed something to be there ) , do you believe that publishing of null results will somewhat curb p-hacking ? 
  ps : i know this is n't sexy work to people who do n't study science but it 's remarkably important . 
  thank you !, 
   an average non-tenured researcher can be seen to have their hands tied in this context, 
  i think it 's also easy to see in this context how someone can have a `` well , everyone else does it '' mentality . 
  as you rightly point out , any shift in the statistical methodology will always be affected by bias . 
  as long as only significant results are published and only publishing keeps people in jobs , we will just see a transfer to effect size hacking . 
  that being said , there are changes that can be made in transparency that could reduce the inclination to p-hack and make it more clear to readers . 
  steps like having people pre-register their methods with journals they wish to submit to , for example , combats a large portion of the issue . 
  the problem is that it 's not always that clear cut . 
  some sort of system where replication papers become linked to the original make sense but i 'm hesitant to support a system where it implies that a failed replication proves the original false . 
  i think the important thing to remember is that while there are many flaws in the process of science , it is our awareness of these flaws and endeavours to remove as many as possible that make science the * most * accurate form of inquiry . 
  remember that you are not defending inductive claims said with certainty , you are defending probablistic claims about what we believe the nature of the world to be based on the best evidence we have . 
  while that evidence is far from perfect , it is still the best evidence available . 
   i feel somewhat vindicated but i 'm fairly sure i 'll be told i should n't . 
  you definitely , definitely should n't be . 
  every single scientist in the world should be aware that they are most certainly biased . 
  that 's why we make every attempt possible to curtail that bias . 
  most importantly , what we are talking about here is small percentage changes in results that become meaningful because of arbitrary significance values ( unconsciously manipulating something from p = .055 to p = .045 for example ) and not an invalidation of entire fields . 
  evolution and vaccinations are still extensively researched topics with near unanimity on the broad claims you have made . 
  this is no way validates either of the claims you made . 
   however , a lot of the work i 'm involved with is more akin to data mining and purely exploratory analyses, 
  i 'm really curious what sort of work you are doing . 
  so if his first fight back is a title fight the entire consequence is that he walks in second and earns like 5k less from reebok ? 
  the horror . 
   i 'm one of the nicest and most caring individuals you will ever have the pleasure to meet but if you screw with me and lie about my character i wont ( sic ) hold back and will make the wrong right . 
  i 'm a really , really nice guy as long as i do n't feel at all slighted and it 's totally convenient for me to be nice . 
  nope . 
  just not true . 
  verbal iq is only one half of a standard iq test ( going off the wais here , slightly more common than the stanford-binet ) and within that , roughly half is memory based . 
  even if you assumed that a psychologist could estimate all of verbal comprehension ( which i doubt ) , that only accounts for 25 % of a total iq score . 
  psychologists are also notorious for stopping people mid sentence to give their opinion . 
  it 's not like that 's literally the firs thing you ever learn in a counselling class . 
  sure . 
  you can get a fairly good idea if someone is bright or not but any psychologist who claimed to be able to predict iq through unstructured conversation would be laughed at by his colleagues . 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  while iq tests are certainly imperfect , they are still extremely useful tools ( for professionals ) to help people in a range of areas . 
  sure , it 's a crude measurement for two people in a dick measuring contest over who is smarter but it was never intended for that . 
  assuming that there were actually iq tests that could accurately assign an iq of over 200 , a score that high would be so rare that we would never actually expect to see one . 
  the odds of someone having an iq of over 205 ( 7 standard deviations above the mean ) is 1 in 390\u00a0682\u00a0215\u00a0445 . 
  because of the way iq tests are constructed , it 's not statistically meaningful to assign a score that far above the mean because the scores are derived from distributions within the population . 
  for context , i believe the highest possible score you can get on the wais ( the most common iq test administered by professionals ) is 160 if i 'm remembering correctly . 
  i 'm sure he did really well on that internet iq test he did though . 
  find your own way inland , exile . 
  right , but i 'm not talking about getting an impression that someone is all of those things , i 'm talking about someone supposing that a professional would try to put a specific iq on someone based on an unstructured conversation is ludicrous . 
  he would be laughed at by his peers . 
  people certainly do have intuitions about the intelligence of others and i 'm sure that some are better at it but guessing a number is dumb . 
  exactly . 
  if a kid struggling in school shows much better verbal iq than working memory , we can instantly find ways to help that kid optimise their learning potential . 
  what a weird thing to pretend to be . 
  not only would it take less than 10 seconds to verify , it would in no way actually make you more likely to do it . 
  i should know , i * am * the queen of england after all . 
  that 's an impressive amount of emotional baggage to spew into one facebook comment . 
  \\  has won 14 more fights than he has lost . 
  a play like that happens so fast and in transition the refs are n't necessarily in perfect position . 
  obviously missed the call but it 's understandable , especially with their bodies sliding across each other like that . 
  things look like fouls from one angle and do n't from others . 
  visual perception is flawed .

  he just wanted to have a conversation with the one person he has sex with . 
  yeah fuck people 's feelings . 
  unless they 're my feelings when you 're saying i ca n't do something . 
  then those feelings ** really ** matter . 
  the cynical part of me thinks that he knows it will get voted down and this allows him to pressure tony/make him look bad . 
  it 's something though i guess . 
  firstly , the title is misleading . 
  the study looks at pure mdma , not ecstasy . 
  also , very , very , very important thing to remember for this and almost all other drug studies . 
  this is a series of experiments done with ** extremely pure ** versions of just the active drug . 
  also , they are using clinically safe doses and testing for a specific purpose . 
  in no way does this study , or any other clinical study on mdma , in any way support the casual use of ecstasy . 
  ** if ** there is sufficient clinical utility of mdma , it should be provided by medical professionals at appropriate doses and only in cases where it is appropriate . 
  this is already done with some illicit drugs ( yes , you can get pure speed from your doctor if you have narcolepsy ) . 
  i 've never heard anyone talk about the movie idiocracy without wanting to claw my own eyes out . 
  you 're totally wrong . 
  sjws are the worst because all feelings are bullshit . 
  it 's their problem if they 're being affected by other people 's behaviour . 
  unless they 're my feelings when someone is telling me i ca n't be an asshole to random people on a private website . 
  then feelings * really * matter . 
  ** i 'm only awkward because i 'm so smart . 
  if you were as smart as me , you would be awkward too ** .
