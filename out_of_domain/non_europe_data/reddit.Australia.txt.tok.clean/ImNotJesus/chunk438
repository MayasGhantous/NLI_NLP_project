  is it bad that this sub has desensitized me so much that i actually had the thought `` at least he asked '' ? 
  the things i like are the things everyone should like . 
  i know i 'm missing the point a bit here but seriously , even if you think calling someone hot is a good first line , can you not go to the extra effort of using actual words ? 
  in his head was he thinking `` hmm , i want her to know i 'm keen but not so keen that i write 4 letters more than i have to '' ? 
  just an fyi , you should always use the pronoun of the gender the person identifies with unless they say otherwise . 
  in this case , it would be best to call caitlyn a she . 
   i do n't give a shit one way or another, 
  why would you be deliberately hurtful to people if you do n't even care ? 
  do you think of yourself as some insightful mastermind that is immune to the liberal elite media conspiracy pushing this agenda ? 
  you 're not . 
  you 're just an asshole . 
  all sorts of magical alternative medicines . 
  it would be fantastic if waving your hands near someone ( reiki ) or ingesting magic water ( homeopathy ) or cracking someone 's spine ( chiropractic ) or taking certain herbs ( naturopathy/chinese or `` traditional '' medicine ) etc. 
  actually helped people . 
  it would be great . 
  unfortunately , it 's not true and people die because of it . 
  infernal blow too, 
  [ here 's a good article on the topic ] ( https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractic-a-brief-overview-part-i/ ), 
  what are you using to apply the curse ? 
  if there 's anything that heterosexual men and homosexual/bi women should be able to bond over , it 's kaylee . 
  also , you handled that like a champ . 
  this one is definitely true because we all know that people who go to church love nothing more than alcoholics swearing and interrupting church . 
  correct . 
  die hard also is n't a documentary . 
  the issue is with people not having conversations with their children about healthy sexual relationships , not unrealistic depictions of sex . 
  just an fyi , the admins consider this vote manipulation and can get your account banned . 
  one of the 5 main rules of reddit is that you are n't allowed to tell other people who to vote . 
  many studies have shown that when people are asked about their satisfaction with their earnings , the amount they earn ** relative ** to their co-workers is far more important than the actual amount . 
  ( i ca n't remember the exact numbers but ) someone who earns say , $ 100,000 a year with co-workers who earn 80k , reports being happier with their income than someone earning 120k when his co-workers earn 150 . 
  what exactly does that screenshot prove ? 
  her willingness to sleep with him does n't change the fact that he 's a predator . 
  the whole reason that what he did was so wrong is that ( a ) he 's an adult and she 's not and ( b ) he has a position of power over her . 
  of course the situation is confusing and upsetting her . 
  that 's the whole fucking point . 
  victim blaming her is fucking gross . 
  she 's a child . 
  he 's an adult . 
   nobody is a victim when two people have consensual sex . 
  simply not true . 
  if a 13 year old agree to have sex with me after i convince them to are they a victim ? 
  kids make stupid mistakes , that 's why we make restrictions on what they are and are n't allowed to do ( driving , voting , drinking etc. ), 
  to try and minimize the harm they do to themselves and others . 
  an adult sleeping with a ** child ** , makes her a victim . 
  even if she does n't see it that way herself yet . 
   she is playing one so she does n't look like a whore . 
  she 's not a whore for sleeping with someone else . 
   she 's , ultimately , ruining his life for a fake sense of good reputation . 
  woah . 
  okay . 
  i do n't know why i responded this far . 
  you 're just an asshole . 
  and relative to yourself . 
  it 's called habituation . 
  you get used to what you have so it 's no longer as exciting . 
  / r/creepypms would appreciate this . 
  not if you 're using an oro 's !, 
  the rules do n't change because of a missed call . 
  obviously it should have been a foul but they ca n't just let him catch the ball because of something else happening . 
  if he had let it hit the ground , the ball would have been rethrown anyway . 
  women are like a calculator , if you put in a logical combination of numbers , you end up with 80085 . 
  flat spell damage mod hype !, 
  i ca n't imagine how some of those ever seemed balanced . 
  can you screenshot the item ? 
  did n't that just shine a bright light of free publicity on them ? 
  both . 
  it 's really nice if cooked well but so is a moderately expensive piece of meat . 
  it 's like , a really expensive violin will make an okay violinist sound better while an amazing violinist can make it sound sublime . 
  however , if you 've never used a violin before , you 're still going to sound like shit . 
   the marbling just looks so fatty . 
  that 's the point . 
  fat is flavour ( when cooked properly ) !, 
  i think it was a typo . 
  in case anyone is wondering , almost nothing he has said is true :, 
  * meta iq is a made up thing . 
  he might be referring to meta-cognition which is when you think about your own thoughts . 
  it 's something everyone does . 
  * social bonding is n't just done in one part of the brain , a huge range of areas are implicated and they 're not just parts of older parts of our brain ( as i think he 's suggesting ) . 
  in fact , the pre-frontal cortex , the newest part of our brain , is very important in socialising . 
  * it goes without saying but iq and tendency to feel emotion are not mutually exclusive . 
  those who think that they can control their emotions solely with their intellect just are n't aware of how their emotions are affecting them . 
  * i have no idea what he is trying to say about episodic memory . 
  i 'm just going to repeat what i said during `` the fappening '' :, 
   this is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes . 
  if you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs , ** of course ** people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities . 
  it would be impossible for that to not seem capricious . 
  if you allow subreddits like / r/niggers , ** of course ** they 're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade . 
  the fine users of / r/jailbait are sharing kiddy porn ? 
  what a ** shocking ** revelation . 
  the point is , you ca n't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall . 
  stand up for standards for a change . 
  actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be . 
  you 'll piss off some people but who cares ? 
  they 're the shitty people you do n't want anyway . 
  instead you 're just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls . 
  edit : to be ** very ** clear , i 'm not defending the ` there are other bad subs so we should be okay ' position a lot of them are taking . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that when you allow reddit to be consumed by communities designed for shitty people to congregate , you ca n't be surprised when reddit becomes populated with shitty people while the people who do n't want to see a front page filled with hate just quietly leave . 
  right but that 's the point . 
  you set the standards and the users change as a result ( either through group pressure or some leaving and others joining ) . 
  if you do n't have any standards , these things just snowball and get worse . 
  you push out the good users for the shitty ones .
