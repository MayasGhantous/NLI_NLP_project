  you missed the point . 
  the point is that if you allow shitty communities you get shitty people in them . 
  it 's a step in the right direction but it 's still only a half step . 
  fingers crossed . 
  actually , basically all the research says the opposite . 
  it 's hugely damaging to efforts to lose weight . 
  the thing is that no one is morbidly obese because things are going well . 
  there 's almost always an underlying psychological cause ( not saying mental illness ) . 
  no on ** wants ** to be that way , just like no one wants to become an alcoholic or use meth etc. , it just happens to some people for a range of reasons . 
  we should look at people who are struggling with care and compassion , not disgust . 
  i completely agree . 
  the problem is that if you let enough of these castles pop up , people from neighbouring kingdoms start to emigrate and you find that you 're getting more of the people you do n't want . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  then it becomes a website i would n't want to be a part of anyway . 
  i aim to make the experience of other users better , not worse . 
  if i 'm not welcome on a site , i do n't want to be there . 
  if the criteria are logical though , that just wo n't happen . 
  i could decide to turn off the news if they started randomly showing video of cocks getting chopped off but i 'm glad there are things in place to stop it happening in the first place . 
  remember that culture is a thing too . 
   it 's just , which end of the spectrum do you want to swing towards ? 
  the one where extreme and distasteful views are openly spouted ? 
  or the one where people are n't allowed to say things if they might hurt someone 's feelings ? 
  you act like there 's no possible middle ground . 
  either way , if i have to pick an end , i pick the one where people are n't assholes to each other . 
  sure . 
  it 's not hard to come up with reasonable rules that fit those criteria without alienating everyone though .

  [ link to the full paper discussed in the article ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070048 ), 
  some people argue that if you make it unpleasant enough for overweight people it will give them extra motivation to lose weight . 
  whether people actually believe that or just use it as an excuse to be an asshole is up for debate but it is still used as an argument . 
  i think he meant having it linked to a melee skill so that it 's cast automatically for you . 
  i really like the change . 
  how useful it is really depends on the cooldown but there are some interesting applications now like tempest shield - curse on hit - chain . 
  i like it , any love for block is fine by me . 
  they 've said that what they 're trying to do in the expansion is to put more pressure on which skills you use . 
  i mean you could use the effect to apply curses . 
  i wonder if the taming can roll . 
  the thing that always gets me about these sorts of posts is that beyond how obviously dumb it is to talk like that , they ** always ** betray the fact that the person does n't understand the words they 're saying anyway . 
  anyone with a decent grasp of english can see that his phrase barely resembles the word hate . 
  good changes , they make sense given the higher level content . 
  no point having 10 item levels that do n't have any benefit . 
  do n't really understand the salt . 
  as far as i know , ggg never promised to not change the tiers and given that the game is constantly being expanded , anyone who assumed their mirrored gear would remain bis only has themselves to blame . 
  the whole point of currency in this game is that you 're taking gambles and some won the crafting gamble , others lost . 
  deal with it . 
  shatterchuck looks fun to me . 
  what it would take is a move away from the idea that spending money on science is a `` bonus '' . 
  it 's what we do when we have money to spare after everything else . 
  the reality is that the future economies of the world are going to be based on ideas and technology , not resources from the ground . 
  smart governments will bite the bullet and invest hard now to be leaders in this future economy but 3-4 year leadership cycles ** strongly ** discourage that type of thinking . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
   but there are a few rules, 
  the reason that you 're confused is that you assume `` free speech '' means that you can do anything you want with no repercussions . 
  reddit has always banned people for behaviour that affects the experience of other users and that 's what fph was doing . 
  here 's the thing , you 're welcome to live in a world where this is about ideas and you 're all crusaders of free speech but it 's just not even close to reality . 
  you 're a bunch of bullies who got called out for being bullies and instead of having the tiniest bit of insight and desire to improve yourself as a person , you just get angry at everyone else . 
  fuck man , if someone told me that my behaviour was harassing other people , i 'd be ** mortified ** , not angry at everyone else . 
  if nothing else , the fact that no one is taking this as an opportunity to look in the mirror should tell you everything you need to know about the type of people on that subreddit . 
  `` fuck people 's feelings , unless you tell me i ca n't do something and it hurts my feelings . 
  then feelings really matter . '', 
  -- every study fucking fph user, 
   if my feelings were hurt i would have messaged the admins and complained about being `` harassed '' by fph being taken down . 
  no you 'd act like a an upset child and throw a tantrum , like you all did . 
   i find it humorous that some redditor supposedly posted a picture of themselves on reddit and was later shocked to find it had been x-posted to fph . 
  whoops , who could have foreseen something like that happening ? 
  a ) not all of the pictures came from reddit, 
  b ) `` do n't walk through dark areas at night or it 's your fault if you get raped '' . 
  no amount of other people 's behaviour excuses being an asshole . 
  edit : since apparently some people are so determined to be argumentative i should clarify . 
  clearly , i do n't think making fun of people is the same as rape . 
  the point of an analogy is to highlight the absurdity of something by showing a more extreme case . 
  i 'm talking about victim blaming , not rape . 
  clearly . 
   i rue the day that kangaroo meat starts climbing in value . 
  ca n't believe you missed the opportunity there . 
  it 's cool but is n't the biggest benefit of converting to chaos that you do n't have to worry about reflect ? 
  i submitted this article because misinformation about alternative medicines is rife and hard to sort through . 
  this article not only explains why a lot of claims are n't true as well as why they betray a basic lack of knowledge . 
  culture is a thing . 
  if you allow hate subs , you create a culture that invites people who are full of hate and vitriol . 
  if you set standards , the * type * of people you get changes over time and the expectations shape behaviour . 
  for what purpose ? 
  that 's really helpful . 
  i 've been wondering for ages where the goat scrotum is . 
  this strategy definitely works . 
  one time i was caught stealing at work and my boss was ** pissed ** . 
  i just refused to engage with him over it and he eventually forgot . 
  also , charlotte was a terrible fit for lance . 
  he was playing isoball with no shooters around him . 
  if you 're betting that he 's going to be better this year it 's a safe bet . 
  put him with the best creator in the game , a legit post-up threat and jj 's shooting and all of a sudden he 's much more useful . 
  his ideal role is wade with lebron , not the iso stuff he was doing this season . 
  this is a gamble for the clips but one that 's 100 % worth it . 
  they give up almost nothing and were in no place to add a decent piece . 
  their only chance for a decent wing ( without s&t ing dj ) was to gamble and this is the highest reward piece they could have gotten . 
  this is a fantastic trade for la. 
  charlotte was a terrible fit for lance .
