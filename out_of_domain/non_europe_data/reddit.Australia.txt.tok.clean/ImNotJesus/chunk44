  flawless victory . 
  empathise with other people and express their own emotions, 
  wow ... til bitches really do love your cash . 
  dungeons and dragons . 
  it 's fun if you get a good group, 
  that really depends on what/where/how, 
  i was in a relationship for my first time and am very glad i was with someone i felt comfortable/safe with . 
  i recommend the same for you . 
  [ r/documentaries ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries ), 
  yes . 
  abstinence only sex education in school is very ineffective and leads to higher rates of stds and pregnancy than decent sex ed . 
  it 's not that it 's rationalised , it 's that ( religious ) kids are taught that sex is sacred but not taught about sex and sexuality so use alternatives . 
  here 's a nice big [ list ] ( http://bluehoney.org/2011/02/19/giant-list-of-interesting-documentaries/ ) for you . 
  most of them are on youtube, 
  you 're talking about virginity pledges [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginity_pledge ) . 
  `` a second peer-reviewed study , also by bearman and brueckner , looked at virginity pledgers five years after their pledge , and found that they have similar proportions of sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) and at least as high proportions of anal and oral sex as those who have not made a virginity pledge . 
  they deduced that pledgers may substitute oral and anal sex for vaginal sex . 
  the data for anal sex without vaginal sex reported by males does not reflect this directly . 
  [ 7 ] [ 9 ] this study also estimated that male pledgers were 4.1 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge ( 25 % vs 6 % ) , and estimated that female pledgers were 3.5 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge ( 21 % vs 6 % ) . 
  the study also noted that those who pledge yet became sexually active reported fewer partners and were not exposed to std risk for as long as nonpledgers . '', 
  conflicting report from an std website [ here ] ( http://std.about.com/od/stdsspecificcommunities/a/virginquestion.htm ), 
  `` furthermore , at least one study has found that teenagers who have engaged in oral and/or anal sex , but not vaginal sex , were more likely to have taken a virginity pledge . 
  this may be one explanation for why that same study of virginity pledges found that pledgers have similar std rates to those who do n't . '', 
  i know my so would be really embarrassed if i did it somewhere public . 
  have you considered that ? 
  but ... but . . we 're australian and she does n't like sport and told me explicitly not to do it anywhere that public, 
  i 've seen you mention it in at least 4 threads, 
  there 's a bunch of different reviews on it but basically the consensus is not teaching kids about safe sex is a huge error, 
  keeping up with the kardashians . 
  started watching it with my so , do n't totally hate it . 
  i was just giving you some more info . 
  i thought that you were being sincere and actually agreed with my point haha, 
  moist,

  edit : oops i mean my so . 
  definitely my so, 
  ask him why they 're not still making tg & ag anymore . 
  seriously , i miss it . 
  maybe the best episode of any show ever made . 
  i do n't think i 'm overstating this, 
  just some really bad hip cramp, 
  nlp is mainly bullshit . 
  derren says himself that most of what he does is crap and explains most of his tricks . 
  he uses a lot of psychology and hypnotism and the rest is illusion . 
  some nlp has value but it 's mainly the shit that 's been stolen from psych ( like priming effects ) . 
  he has a book on hypnotism though , if you want to learn the basics . 
  long island ice tea, 
  you accidentally a question, 
  then why the fuck does it matter ??? 
  oh dude , you 're such a douche . 
  you do n't want to reassure her that she 's not going to lose her because you 're worried that means she wo n't lose the weight ? 
  you 're not just a douche , you 're a stupid douche because if you knew anything about women you 'd realise that she 'd be far more likely to lose the weight if she felt loved and accepted than blackmailed into it . 
  wiping my hands of this . 
  i wanted to be a basketball player when i grew up . 
  turns out that does n't happen to 5 '10 white jews very often . 
  the ones we find cutest are generally the ones closest to babies ( big eyes are the most common ) . 
  some animals became cuter as an evolutionary response to humans ( dogs from wolves ) and others just match our schema for something we want to protect . 
  yes . 
  kids play sexual games and do n't really understand the connotations . 
  it does n't necessarily mean you 're gay if you wanted to touch another boy 's penis when you were young but it also does n't mean you 're straight . 
  kids are just kids and they explore things they do n't understand . 
  spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacedicks, 
  it probably would n't * do * anything because there is no-one to do the doing .

  the world 's most interesting all-caps talker, 
  that 's right , now they 're after those delicious mars bars, 
  this one time , i thought i saw a ghost but then i remembered that i 'm not insane . 
  i 'm kind to the people around me so that they 're kind back to me . 
  i guess i 'll do mine : i get downvoted like crazy whenever i say that spanking children is wrong . 
  edit : clarity, 
  you have the right to be weirded out but i would n't worry about it , it does n't necessarily mean that he 's attracted to them . 
  it 's not that uncommon for teenage boys to have fantasies or confusing thoughts about family members ( according to a therapist i know ) and it 's just part of the normal exploration of sexuality . 
  it does n't mean he is going to be incestuous in the future . 
  i think you 're in the majority there . 
  my biggest pet peeve is [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=pet+peeve&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  do you know what the word agnostic means ? 
  did you want to be a spelunker because it 's an awesome word ? 
  ouch, 
  right but being a theist makes you in the minority on reddit ( i would think ) but i would think that agnostic is the vast majority . 
  if you 'd said agnostic theist i definitely would 've agreed that you 're outnumbered, 
  nice try , officer, 
  that drag race tv show * has * to be hurting his chances to be elected, 
  i 've never heard of it and i highly doubt it since i do n't really see how they 'd benefit from it . 
  especially because that would hurt exports and encourage imports which is bad for the economy . 
  late to an university exam a couple of days ago . 
  story please, 
  given that they 're divorced , i do n't . 
  that being said my mum remarried and is very happy . 
  being happy with a person for decades is very difficult but the payoff is definitely worth trying for . 
  roasted hazelnuts, 
  why do you need something ? 
  but if you just rub one out it 'll take a couple of minutes and you can get back to it . 
  any other method will take appreciably longer, 
  that you know of, 
  finishing my uni exams for the semester, 
  do you feel guilty for religious reasons ? 
  my old boss, 
  yes it is possible . 
  if it 's getting in the way of your life i would recommend seeing a therapist to flesh out some of these issues because getting to the root of your anxieties of being hurt ( i realise that you know it has to do with your ex but analysing it on a deeper level ) is the best way to make sure the anxieties do n't rule you .
