  his ideal role is wade with lebron , not the iso stuff he was doing this season . 
  this is a gamble for the clips but one that 's 100 % worth it . 
  they give up almost nothing and were in no place to add a decent piece . 
  their only chance for a decent wing ( without s&t ing dj ) was to gamble and this is the highest reward piece they could have gotten . 
  absolutely . 
  i 'd much rather play lance at the 3 and have jj in for shooting . 
  actually it 's still the 14-15 season so they could i believe . 
  just as long as no-one invites delonte west, 
  50 --  70 is a big buff for spark . 
  if i understand correctly it 's less overall duration and duration is now based on the amount of damage you do . 
  i thought only freeze was based on damage, 
  that 's weapon damage , not spell damage . 
  til, 
  that 's weapon damage , not spell damage . 
  sneaky scion buff . 
  hard to know how to evaluate that node until we understand the new mechanics better . 
  translation, 
   i find it hard to carry out conversations with most people because i 'm so distracted by imagining myself masturbating in front of a mirror . 
  i 've collected 12 stamps on my being nice card and i 'd like to exchange it for a girlfriend . 
  as someone who met his wife on a dating site , you ** have ** to have thick skin and remember that women are flooded with bullshit on those sites constantly . 
  their guards are up . 
  just be patient and try to find someone you click with , you 'll enjoy it much more if you assume that you 're going to need to go on a lot of shitty dates before you find someone you like . 
  i 'm pretty sure all the values are just 20 % of the original . 
  hell of a lot less competition back then too . 
  fewer channels , no netflix , no other basketball streaming options . 
  like clarity ? 
  it could work like clarity and reduce a flat amount per level . 
  that would make it more available to casters but still viable for anyone who wants to invest enough . 
  i 'm very glad that both will be getting punched in the face soon . 
  philly pick an injured big man somehow . 
  not that unlikely at this stage . 
  porzingis , mudiay and russell all in the conversation for 2-5 . 
  to be clear , the guy in the video did n't post it but he is in the comments basking in the glory of internet tough guys heaping praise on him for being a felon . 
  he did post it a few days ago on / r/craigslistscammers but i just want to be clear so people do n't go all reddit brigade on the / r/videos post op . 
  i do n't think anyone is claiming that there 's a white on african american genocide happening in the us . 
  it 's a symptom of centuries of racism , wealth disparity , inequality and a range of other factors . 
  i think you misunderstood my point . 
  that the guy i 'm replying to is arguing against a strawman . 
  the issue of african american deaths is n't because white people are * currently * murdering them en masse , it 's a result of systematic racism , unequal access to resources and oppression . 
  please do n't agree with me . 
  flame totem . 
  put it down and it does the work for you . 
  empower, 
  wait , you were only excited for the league because you thought it would be efficient farming ? 
  there 's a whole field of psychology devoted to this stuff !, 
  you should read up on haidt 's social intuitionist model or greene 's dual process model . 
  both discuss the way we generally make moral decisions based on emotional reasoning and then use cognitive processes to justify the reasoning * after * we 've already decided . 
  i think the more important question is why the fuck would you create a subreddit devoted to voat and then proceed to * sit on reddit * . 
  they might as well yell, 
   ** look . 
  look how hard i 'm ignoring you **, 
  i just do n't understand why anyone would sit on reddit to talk about how much they do n't want to be on reddit . 
  if you do n't like it , just leave . 
  it 's a fucking website used for recreation , you 're not getting anything out of it just do n't use it . 
  if you think there 's an srs takeover or whatever insane theory they have , just fucking leave . 
  why would you want to be a part of it ? 
  i just do n't understand at all . 
   well since reddit has turned into [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gqayo5w ) it really does n't matter anymore : /, 
  is currently +16 . 
  when you ca n't tell them apart from / r/circlejerk ... 
  kerr was actually more qualified because of his work in phoenix, 
  i 'm just glad to see that fewer and fewer people are meeting their spouses in their family, 
  if only there was some sort of engine that you could search to find out this sort of information . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=joke ), 
  i like that she smiled at him instead of making him feel like a creep . 
  i am ** shocked ** . 
  ** shocked ** that she wanted to date someone hot . 
  dumb bitches do n't know what 's good for them . 
  i , as their caring ~ ~ manipulator ~ ~ friend , would be a far better match because i see myself as a good person . 
  if abbott makes policy choices based on his personal beliefs it 's an entirely relevant question . 
  abbott has publicly stated that his religious beliefs impact on his decisions . 
  the pope impacts on people 's religious beliefs . 
  therefore , it has an impact . 
  i 'm not sure where the breakdown in logic is for you . 
  rip, 
  you mean you talk out of your ass ? 
  i think if you tried really hard you could make more dumb assumptions . 
  mate , that post is 16 hours old and was +9 . 
  no one saw it . 
  surely it does n't hurt to have it posted again given that people are clearly interested in it . 
  i understand wanting to remove reposts but many other subreddits will only remove reposts if the original was actually seen by users . 
  i do n't see the benefit here . 
  this post had more upvotes in 10 minutes , there 's clearly interest in the story but the first was missed for whatever reason . 
  you need shooters . 
  lamb can shoot . 
  makes sense to me . 
  tarik black can play, 
  i like to think that tony sits at home at night watching old game tapes . 
  like a young nba player watches videos of jordan , abbott sits at home studying every bush move . 
  good luck !, 
  overpowered . 
  too many more multipliers for physical damage . 
  just remember guys , if this goes well it gives us access to more and more interesting people for amas . 
  if you ** genuinely ** care about these issues , irrespective of which side you 're on , you should be cheering for the opportunity to ask questions from senior people at monsnato . 
  also , remember that downvotes are for hiding things that do n't contribute , not things you disagree with . 
  if you consider yourself to at all care about science , you want the discussion heard . 
  if you think he 's wrong , show it the right way , ** with evidence ** , not pettiness . 
  i do n't really understand your point but rest assured that ( a ) / r/science has never been asked to delete comments besides those specified in the sitewide rules ( e.g. , child porn , doxxing etc. 
  which we would remove anyway ) and ( b ) i have never seen an admin remove any comment on / r/science . 
  if there are a lot of [ deleted ] comments , it will be because the moderators have the removed the question for being inappropriate for the forum .
