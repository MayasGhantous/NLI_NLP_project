  while hard questions are allowed , we expect all of our users to show respect to our visitors , irrespective of how much they agree with them . 
  thank you for educating us on what science is and is n't but the entire / r/science mod group are practicing scientists . 
  as i said before , difficult questions are allowed but `` gotcha '' questions or thinly veiled attempts at attacking the guest wo n't be allowed . 
  you can ask a question on any topic related to monsanto one the proviso that it 's actually a genuine attempt to get an answer ( not just an attack ) and it 's worded politely . 
  the good news is that he seems excited and game . 
  he 's also a real scientist and not just a pr person . 
  seems like a terrible business model . 
  i literally just said the opposite . 
  well done for showing yourself incapable of being civil and unbiased here . 
  hopefully people upvote the interesting questions but at the same time , the point of this is for him to answer the things people are worried about or interested in . 
  it would be a shame to have an experienced scientist only talking about business practices but if that 's what people want to know about and he 's happy to answer , i guess it 's fine . 
  while i like your idea in principle , it kind of defeats the purpose of the ama if we then answer things pre-emptively on his behalf . 
  excellent question, 
  as per usual , any expert opinions are welcome and invited . 
  just try your best to cite your answers given the nature of the topic . 
  perfect . 
   to be fair , reddit has already been host to president obama , bill nye and other extremely important and famous people . 
  the idea of an ama has been copied on other websites . 
  i think / r/science is going to get more people in the future from here on out anyway, 
  right but we do n't want people who are coming here to promote things . 
  if we really want scientists who are just interested in coming for the sake of dialogue and science communication , we need to show that it 's an appropriate place to do that . 
  you wo n't get someone from monsnato on / r/iama discussing the science . 
   when people have to be reminded to be civil with you while asking questions about what you do for a living it 's time to change what you do for a living . 
  people are wrong about a lot of things . 
  both op and i are mods . 
  neither of us are getting paid . 
  you are more than welcome to ask hard questions . 
  just make sure that they 're polite and actually an attempt to get an answer , not just a thinly veiled attempt to argue a point . 
  yeah , fuck fighter safety . 
  so boring . 
  i mean , like , he 's right , i guess . 
  it 's just that he 's correcting himself on something he understood incorrectly in the first place . 
  this guy is such a `` niceguy '' cliche . 
  call you m ` lady a few times and when you do n't instantly swoon turn into a hateful asshole . 
  it 's always someone else 's fault . 
  well , if you 're going to love yourself your hand is a good place to start . 
  nice rim protection . 
  flame totem is great for a first build . 
  yeah i think that 's my favourite one . 
  the range is insane . 
  edit : [ a list for anyone interested ] ( http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/drop-restricted_item#league-specific_uniques ), 
  is it your card ? 
  i love it . 
  i assume it will be very rare given how good some of the items are and imagine farming all that time to get the gull or lead sprinkler or something . 
  i wonder if each item has the same chance when you hand it in . 
  i guess they could balance it in two different ways ; either make the card super rare and equal chance for all items or have the card not that rare but make you much more likely to get a gull on hand in than a headhunter . 
   if we had just let that comment be dealt with on the show and just moved on he would have become a world renowned superstar like everyone else who asks a question on qanda . 
   `` unfortunately no middle ground exists and there 's no place for nuance in our arguments on national security . 
  that 's a shame . '', 
  god damn , the sbs is nailing it . 
  these articles are getting better and better . 
  on what basis are they worse ? 
  they 're quite backwards in their position in gmos and an argument could be made that their nuclear stance is poor but their track record on human rights and equality is pretty fantastic . 
  exactly . 
  voting in america is voluntary and they 've never voted someone bad in . 
  there 's a similar and related scale that they are also very high in . 
  it 's call social dominance orientation . 
  you 're acting like that 's the only reason people voted liberal . 
  it was n't a referendum . 
  can you imagine him as a spur ? 
  they 're both wrong . 
  the correct term is females or m ` lady when addressing them directly . 
  i 'm into this really underground thing called the internet . 
  you 've probably never heard of it . 
  cap holds . 
  all leech values were reduced to 20 % of their former value on uniques . 
  there was n't an announcement of that value . 
  they announced they were changing values and then if you look at uniques in the beta they 're all 20 % . 
  rbbg, 
  thanks, 
  have to wonder if dillashaw barao is on a free card because they 're worried about another nova unaio guy not making it to fight day . 
  at this point i really wish they 'd just come out and say `` i 'm against gay marriage because i think gay people are icky '' . 
  it least it would have a shred of honesty and dignity instead of this post-hoc rationalized garbage . 
  it depends on the protections but this seems like an ** insane ** deal for the sixers . 
  holy shit . 
  just goes to show that if you save cap room you can have all the leverage when another team is panic trading . 
  yeah , thank god we traded harden so we did n't have to go over the cap ... 
  edit : to be clear , i really like kanter and think he 's a fantastic fit . 
  this will also be a value deal in 2 years . 
  just hard not to be salty . 
  i know it 's frustrating but we have no other tools available to us . 
  we are talking about years of poor communication and poor response to asking for support and better tools . 
  firing the one person who consistently supported the moderators is just too much . 
  we have no way of communicating with them . 
  it would be extremely unprofessional for reddit to tell us that . 
  i used to be a moderator of / r/iama . 
  after only a few pm conversations with / u/chooter she offered to show my wife and i around the ny offices while we were there on our honeymoon . 
  she showed us around , gave us a t-shirt and a snoo and spent a good 45 minutes chatting to us about everything from our lives to giving us some recommendations for places to go to lunch . 
  i sat in * that * chair in the picture . 
  you very rarely meet people that are just genuinely lovely to everyone around them and she is one of those people . 
  she did n't have to give me the time of day . 
  i do n't know all the details of why she was fired . 
  it seems mostly to be a difference of opinion about the future of reddit from what i have heard ( did n't hear that from her directly ) . 
  but having met her in person and chatted to her several times , i have absolutely no doubt in my mind that her firing was unreasonable . 
  i could be wrong but that 's just how i see it . 
  edit : to be clear , that 's just my personal opinion . 
  not representing any sub when i say all of that but there 's a reason that anyone who has dealt with her was outraged . 
  edit 2 : the shut down of many big subs does n't have anything to do with just us liking vic . 
  i 'm responding specifically to this post and not the larger issues of mod-admin relations ** that were issues well before ellen pao became ceo ** . 
  as an example , the system we use to receive messages from users is horrific .
