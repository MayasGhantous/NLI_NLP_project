  it works just like your normal inbox and there 's no way to search so anything more than a day or two old is impossible to find . 
  they have been `` working on it '' for the whole 3.5 years i 've been a mod . 
  nothing bad happened , i just got too busy to mod a lot . 
  i think that moderating should only be done by people who can commit the time to be regularly active in modmail and up to date with eveerything that 's happening . 
  because of some real life circumstances i ca n't do that so i stepped down in / r/iama and have stopped actively modding in / r/science and / r/askreddit, 
  it 's a bit different when you 've been around for a few years compared to a few weeks . 
  for an hour of my 4 week honeymoon while already in the area , yes . 
  i have been saying for years that the communication between admins and moderators is terrible . 
  the last 12-18 months though the admins have been making a concerted effort to reduce the power of default moderators . 
  they want to be able to make unilateral decisions without considering what the moderators want which i understand , ** but ** , what they 're forgetting and what today is really about is that the users run this website . 
  reddit ** is ** the users . 
  they ca n't run reddit without default mods . 
  my other big issue is that their spin is really , really transparent . 
  have you ever had a boss that was not as smart or charming as they thought they were ? 
  where they try to manipulate everyone but it 's really obvious ? 
  that 's what it feels like , it feels condescending and disingenuous . 
  here is a link to a post i made about some of my gripes a while ago : [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/ckbga2v?context=5#ckbga2v ), 
  it 's just my opinion and i could be wrong . 
  / r/science too . 
  there is something ** very ** big in the works that was put in jeopardy . 
  do you really want to have this conversation in public because we both know there was more to it . 
  my response is specific to this post . 
  hard to say but honestly i was probably actually reading amas less when i was modding there . 
  most of the work is done behind the scenes , the amas run themselves . 
  honestly , i just want them to actually care about the jobs that moderators do , beyond a gift of gold every couple of years . 
  take the time and effort to do the things they 've promised ( like updating modmail which was promised years ago ) and have more consistent dialogue with the moderators . 
  no one knows more about what 's going on with this website than the active default moderators . 
  i do n't want to pick and choose admins but there are some very lovely people who work there . 
  cupcake is gone now but she was always a delight to deal with ( if not clearly overworked ) . 
  krispykrackers has always been extremely approachable and is a really lovely person too . 
  i have no way of evaluating ellen as a ceo . 
  there are a lot of moving parts in a large company like this and without actually being there day to day i ca n't possibly know that sorry . 
  hard to say exactly because everyone does it differently . 
  i tended to do it while i was doing other things so it 's hard to quantify but modding 3 very active and different defaults is a time commitment, 
  you hear more from pissed off people than happy people but i take enjoyment in helping create something that people love . 
  i get to make a lot of people 's days better . 
  victoria is n't being rehired and i doubt she would want that at this stage . 
  we have a longstanding policy to remove any harassment of users and not give traffic to any hate subreddits . 
  this is a policy we have had in place well before ellen pao became ceo . 
  actually , that 's simply not accurate . 
  our `` job '' is to make askreddit an enjoyable place for all users . 
  allowing people to act in a way that makes askreddit an unpleasant experience for other users is not okay with us . 
  we care more about the right of users to have an enjoyable an harassment free experience than the right of people to harass others . 
  if you do n't feel comfortable with that , there are many other subreddits that might better fit what you 're looking for . 
  this has been our policy for quite a while now and it has improved the overall quality of the subreddit . 
  again , if you feel censored not being able to harass other users , you 're probably not the type of person we want in the subreddit . 
  here 's a modpost on it from a year and a half ago [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/20uvh2/modpost_small_rule_change_a_clarification_a/ ), 
   dozen or so of self important nerds, 
  and this is where you stop getting responses . 
  i was respectful of your opinion but i 'm not interested in arguing with someone . 
  thank you for your feedback . 
  100 % false . 
  if that were the case i would have left every mod position i have . 
  we 're trying to give them the benefit of the doubt . 
  we actually want a good working relationship with the admins and are committed to trying . 
  we made our point , they said they 're going to try , what would it achieve to stay dark longer ? 
  which is their right if they want to do that . 
  i would step down as a moderator but if they want to have paid moderators or treat moderators poorly enough that the ones who have been doing it for years step down , that 's their choice as a company . 
  i do n't think it 's a good one but it 's not my choice to make . 
  as a moderator of three of the key defaults that shut down , i really want to stress that we want to give them a chance to live up to their word here . 
  they 're saying all the right things and we really want a positive relationship with the admins . 
  i really hope they 've heard our complaints and understand how much work moderators put into running the site . 
  / u/krispykrackers is a fantastic admin and i 've had nothing but lovely interactions with her . 
  i hope mod-admin relations are a real focus of the company as a whole and we can move back towards working together . 
  they said they want to change things and have given specifics . 
  might as well see if it 's going to happen . 
  what is achieved by staying closed longer ? 
  there 's a really small chance that you 're being a bit melodramatic about this . 
  did n't downvote you buddy , 
  the protest was very clearly about admin-mod relations and had nothing to do with `` sjw '' policies . 
  these are issues that have been ongoing for years . 
  the reason that / r/science , / r/books and / r/iama all shut down originally was that they were left in the lurch by victoria leaving . 
  she was in the process of managing a lot of ongoing things and there was ( a ) no clear plan in place or ( b ) communication to the moderators . 
  other subreddits joined in because there are long standing issues of mod-admin relations . 
  there have been calls for improvement to mod tools for years and losing one of the few admins who actually communicated with mods was a straw that broke the camels back . 
  no subreddit shut down to protest vic being fired . 
  worth adding that there is no evidence that omega-3 has a meaningful health benefit to otherwise healthy people .

  it 'll be very interesting to see what the admins do here . 
  i do n't know if there 's a precedent . 
  that would be a very bold move right now considering it would be fairly unprecedented, 
  / r/science mod here . 
  the conversation is real . 
  it was shared in a private subreddit and someone leaked it , we do n't know who .

  use a 6l chest for cyclone ? 
  not worthless . 
  use it for a single target or something . 
  then what 's your problem ? 
  just have imperfect links . 
  click my username , you can see that i 'm a mod there . 
  our aim is accountability and transparency . 
  we tried to make sure it was small and discreet * . 
  it 's unfortunate that it affects users too but we do n't have any other recourse . 
  please remember that a lot of the changes we 're asking for are things that will make it easier to improve the subreddit . 
  for example , our system of receiving mail from the users is insanely poor . 
  anything over a couple of days old is basically lost to the sands of time . 
  that 's not fair to the users who message us .
