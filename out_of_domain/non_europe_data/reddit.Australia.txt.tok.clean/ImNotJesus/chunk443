  you may no realise that it affects you directly that we do n't have tools to stop brigading or quickly make admins aware of doxxing but it 's for the users , not us . 
  yes , they run the site and can do what they want . 
  if they decide to remove us that 's their prerogative . 
  i 'm betting they still need volunteers to run their website though . 
  the plan is to do that first . 
  no they did n't it was shopped . 
  i have been screaming this from the rooftops . 
  it might be weird , it might not be . 
  that depends on you , him , your relationship and your communication . 
  these things * can * get complicated and feelings can get involved but sometimes they 're just fun for both parties . 
  if you 're interested and think he might be , my best advice is just to lay everything on the table and be really honest about what your expectations of each other are . 
  some have been made by third part apps ( the creators have pleaded with the admins to steal their work ) and other things need to be created . 
  also posted in that thread : [ his intro message when he approached her ] ( https://i.imgur.com/4s4mwmi.jpg ), 
  hi gccmelb , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it is not scientific in nature . 
  posts must be about recently publish peer reviewed research . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3c8bqc/threeyearold_suffers_alcohol_poisoning_after/ ) . 
  maybe they 're just concerned that north korea will see our human rights as decadent . 
  the funniest part of all this is the people panic selling their bis rares because one could potentially be slightly better . 
  good luck making better rares than loath bane now . 
  the reason to play standard is that you want to accumulate wealth and fuck around with crazy items . 
  i 'm fine with there being more crazy items in standard than new leagues . 
  in standard if you play for any reasonable amount of time you can get ** very , very ** good gear . 
  that 's fine for most people . 
  if you want bis gear , you have to play a huge amount more time and become one of the super rich . 
  that 's fine for them . 
  i do n't really see a problem as no one is limited in what they can achieve . 
  for those that have n't read it , richard denniss also wrote a [ ** must read ** article ] ( http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2015/april/1427806800/richard-denniss/spreadsheets-power ) about how economic modelling is used to deliberately mislead . 
  teague is also remarkably efficient and a better defender . 
  i 've never really understood how some people having lots of gear affects people who have less gear in standard . 
  it 's not a competitive game in standard . 
  the summon is getting the kill . 
  same as curses that grant charges . 
  stop distracting the poor man . 
  hot take : pop makes players look good . 
  it seems very much like a bit where they 're both playing along and bantering . 
  having a kid ( when you 're ready to ) . 
  you think you 're going to love them but then it 's like a whole new level . 
  i ca n't believe how many times a day he makes me smile . 
  sounds like a folk band name . 
  they certainly have their shortcomings but they 'll be on the right side of a lot more history than either labor or the coalition . 
  slightly related question , do any auras/heralds affect ea ? 
  where are you quoting that from ? 
  thanks . 
  every single person in every single job has bad days and sometimes makes emotional decisions . 
  the ability to recognise and act on that makes / u/krispykrackers a much ** better ** admin , not worse . 
  once you and / u/deimorz have had a chance to sit and work out ( a ) what the priorities are and ( b ) how long you think things will take do you think you could update us with that information ? 
  it really does look like a positive step forward and i 'm exciting but we 've had `` we 're working on it '' for quite a few years now . 
  there 's no need to admit something like that , especially in public . 
  i actually think the shadowban was very much justified . 
  trying to get reddit users to harass a business is bullshit . 
  how the fuck would she know to think about it otherwise ? 
  right , you can make an argument for that , in any of my defaults that probably would 've been permanent . 
  either way , it was n't some unfounded , crazy , emotional decision . 
   shadowbans are fucking stupid and pointless . 
  just ban them outright or not at all . 
  i do n't disagree but that 's their system that / u/krispykrackers has to work within . 
  ca n't blame her for not using a tool she does n't have . 
  there 's no sitewide ban function . 
  the website as a whole works differently to individual subreddits ... 
  one advantage we offer over amas in / r/iama or other subreddits that hold them is that we also have thousands of experts who regularly read the subreddit . 
  while not a formal peer-review process , there is plenty of room of practising scientists to politely refute claims made by anyone doing an ama . 
  i do n't have the link on hand but we had an ama about a year ago from a scientist embroiled in a lot of controversy . 
  the response from the users was fantastic . 
  it was direct , respectful and made clear the flaws in his work while still giving him the space to present it . 
  exactly . 
  the `` protest '' has to some extent been co-opted by those who are angry about fph being banned or personally dislike ellen pao . 
  we want nothing to do with any of that . 
  our one and only concern is making sure we have the tools to appropriately run the subreddit . 
   monetizing always interferes with integrity, 
  we have had no indication of any attempts by the admins to change how we do things . 
  if that ever happens , we 'll respond appropriately . 
  you should be aware that / r/science has very strict comment moderation rules as well . 
  we believe that it 's important for everyone to be able to enjoy a harassment free experience that is focused on content . 
  we ca n't comment on removals by other subreddits as there is no way for us to know why they are doing it . 
  i 'm not sure how you can argue that a scientist spending several hours answering difficult and unfiltered questions is a pr stunt but if you do n't enjoy the content no-one is forcing you to read it . 
  we have no control over the hiring and firing practices at reddit . 
  it 's not our place to comment as a subreddit because we do n't have all of the information and , again , it 's not up to us . 
  vic was a lovely person who i have had many great interactions with but scientific ethics has no relationship with that . 
   except they 've already changed how you do things . 
  you mean that they wont change it even further ? 
  they fired someone for reasons that we 're not aware of . 
  they may have been legitimate they may not have . 
  their communication was poor and they 've acknowledged that and talked to us about new strategies moving forward . 
   how many times do reddit need to break their promises before their promises are simply no longer trustworthy ? 
  we want to have a positive working relationship with the admins and they appear committed to doing that as well . 
  / u/krispykrackers has long been a great ally to moderators and putting / u/deimorz on mod improvements full time is a huge coup . 
  they have given us what we asked for , how does it help to keep stomping our feet ? 
   so why say `` we support reddit '' instead of `` reddit is the best mechanism to achieve our goals and for the foreseeable future we intend on staying here ? '', 
  they are essentially one and the same in this instance . 
  we support reddit as a company because we believe they will take the appropriate steps to maintain reddit as the best place for us to do science outreach . 
  if they were to take actions that did n't help us towards that goal , we would no longer support them . 
  we want to have a positive working relationship with the admins and they appear committed to doing that as well . 
  / u/krispykrackers has long been a great ally to moderators and putting / u/deimorz on mod improvements full time is a huge coup . 
  it may sound political but given the current climate on reddit and the amount of differing opinions about what reddit will look like moving forward , we want to make it clear that we have every intention of moving forward with reddit . 
   there was no good reason given for firing people . 
  they have no duty to tell us why they fired her . 
  in fact , it would be obscenely inappropriate for them to . 
   how would you like it if a scientific lab just randomly fired people for no good reason ? 
  we 're not employees at reddit .
