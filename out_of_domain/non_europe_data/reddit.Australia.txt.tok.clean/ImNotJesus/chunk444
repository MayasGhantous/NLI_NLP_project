  if other employees were upset , that would be justified . 
  again , it 's none of our business who they hire and fire except in how it affects our day to day running . 
  it 's against the rules of reddit to receive any compensation for moderating and i would be very upset to hear anyone on the team doing that . 
  edit : if you ever have evidence of someone accepting money for moderating duties , please do let me or any of the other moderators know and they will be removed immediately . 
  until then , you are just recklessly speculating . 
  we have no intention to leave while this is still the most appropriate place for us to do science outreach . 
  if there was ever a reason to believe that that goal was compromised , we would reassess . 
  at this stage , we have been remarkably successful so there is no reason to change course . 
  to be clear , our one criteria was that questions be respectful . 
  if you actually read the ama , there were many critical and difficult questions . 
  we were n't shielding him from that , we just expect our users to no aggressively attack our guests . 
  i do n't think that that 's unreasonable . 
  hard questions will always be welcome in / r/science as long as they 're done in the right way, 
  we would refuse to host it . 
  i 'm genuinely not sure how anyone who read the ama can believe that . 
  many of the top questions were difficult and we also allowed questions on their business practices . 
   because it 's not like silencing dissenters ever hurt science or anything . 
  we have absolutely no evidence of the admins ever `` silencing dissenters '' , especially on / r/science . 
  given there are extremely active subreddits devoted to `` bringing down reddit '' that are n't banned , it would take a fairly one-eyed person to actually believe that . 
   imagine if the church could have shadow banned galileo . 
  there 's a very small chance you 're being a bit melodramatic . 
  again , all we care about here is the ability to provide science communication . 
  if the admins ever acted in a way that stopped us doing that effectively , like they did a few days ago , we would let them know about it and work on a solution . 
  if you ever have evidence of someone accepting money for moderating duties , please do let me or any of the other moderators know and they will be removed immediately . 
  until then , you are just recklessly speculating . 
   legitimate tough questions are not harassment . 
  which is why they were allowed . 
  i have never interacted with ellen or the board . 
  i have no idea what their long-term plans are . 
  what i do know is that / u/krispykrackers is a fantastic admin and lovely person . 
  she seems to genuinely intend to use her position to make the mod-admin relationship better and is being given resources to do so . 
  until i see otherwise , i support their attempt to move things forward . 
   but it does affect day to day running , people feel bad when employees get randomly fired for no good reason . 
  it effects the way we think . 
  if reddit treats their employees badly , then they will treat their users even worse !, 
  you 're making a lot of assumptions there . 
  if things change , let 's address it as it happens instead of guessing . 
  a ) we did n't pre-screen questions . 
  we reminded people of our standard rules and offered people the chance to ** check ** if their question fit within those rules . 
  we moderated it ** exactly ** the same as we do with any scientist from any institution . 
  b ) i ignored the other part because i do n't care what people do on the rest of reddit . 
  it 's not our job as moderators of ** this ** subreddit to care . 
   i know you can not speak out against reddit for fear your account will be next one to be shadowbanned . 
  fear is how tyrants control people . 
  and we 're done . 
  this is n't some fascist regime with a secret police and if you genuinely believe them to be , you should perhaps find another website to spend your time on . 
   how do you think the admins would react to an iama from a scientist who had just published an study on how black people are genetically predisposed to having a lower iq ? 
  we have never had any pressure from the admins to remove or support any content except for the five rules of reddit that all subreddits are expected to follow . 
  if we thought it was appropriate to run an ama on that and they tried to intervene , we would deal with that then . 
  there 's no point speculating about things they have never done or shown any intention of doing . 
  we have no contract and no . 
  as long as we were n't manipulating anything on reddit or receiving any monetary incentives to moderate . 
  you 're right , i changed my first reply . 
  the same way we moderate all amas . 
  hard questions will always be allowed as long as they are based on the science and respectful . 
  irrespective of what any users ( or us ) think about the scientist doing the ama , we will always treat them like guests and users need to be respectful . 
  very good point . 
  also it would have prohibitively expensive start up costs . 
   they have ? 
  well ok ... 
  i do n't know what you asked for ... 
  but they certainly have n't given anything of what the rest of reddit 's active userbase has asked for , because to the rest of us , we 've actually asked for a bit more than just empty promises . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're asking us to do here . 
  you want us to shut down because some users are angry at things that do n't affect / r/science ? 
  our intention is to broaden the types of scientist we bring in . 
  we have mostly had academics thus far but we want to have a wider range of discussions since there are many different types of scientists out there . 
  we will still only be inviting ** scientists ** , working on mature projects and not receive any compensation for any amas . 
  all of the moderators are practicing scientists that are devoted to science communication . 
  we trust the userbase to have the maturity to deal with scientists in different areas . 
  as an example , we had a wonderful ama from a scientist at monsanto recently , filled with tough but respectful questions about the ** science ** . 
  we have absolutely no interest in merely being an advertising platform for large companies . 
  one advantage we offer over amas in / r/iama or other subreddits that hold them is that we also have thousands of experts who regularly read the subreddit . 
  while not a formal peer-review process , there is plenty of room of practising scientists to politely refute claims made by anyone doing an ama . 
  slowly . 
  we would definitely notice . 
  we get a notification any time a moderator is added and by who . 
  we , as a team , are responsible for any new moderator that joins and it would be very obvious if one changed . 
  which is why we temporarily shut down , shared our frustrations and then re-opened once they had addressed our problems . 
  we 're not fast tracking anything . 
  at a time of upheaval and misinformation about why subreddits shut down , this is simply a ` state of the subreddit ' post explaining clearly where we are and where we 're headed . 
  we have already done many industry amas and are just expressing that we plan to do more in the future . 
  i am the moderator of three of the first 5 or so subreddits to close down . 
  i 'm fairly certain i know why we did it . 
  there may be others who are angry at the website for other reasons but that has absolutely nothing to do with why / r/science shut down . 
   i was specifically addressing the current state of the protest , where you chose above to speculate on motivation . 
  right , and we have no intention to act based on the `` current state '' of the protest . 
  that should be clear from this post - we support reddit and want to move forward positively . 
  there 's a lot of anti-admin vitriol and the unhappy people are always louder than the happy . 
  ** why wo n't the admins apologise ? 
   we 're sorry , we fucked up . 
  ** this is just a pr stunt **, 
  it was given * by * the admins , to all moderators of default subreddits and is n't tradeable for anything of value . 
  it was given because some gold features make moderating easier . 
   i hope i 'm just a tin foil hat wearing nut . 
  you are . 
  / u/motha _ effin_kitty_yo is one of the worst moderators around . 
   reparations, 
  they 're not making up for slavery . 
  they told us they were going to work on the mod tools we asked for . 
  do you expect them to just appear out of thin air ?
