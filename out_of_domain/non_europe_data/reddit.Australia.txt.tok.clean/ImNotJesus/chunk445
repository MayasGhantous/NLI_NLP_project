  did i just have a stroke ? 
  the subreddits were shut down because we wanted better mod tools and better communication from admins . 
  they have promised both . 
  i 'm also a moderator of / r/iama and while i have a lot of affection for vic and met her in person myself , it 's not our place to tell reddit who to hire/fire . 
  it 's also worth noting that / r/iama did n't shut down because we were angry she was fired , it was because we were angry that no-one told us ahead of time , helped us prepare or communicated in any way . 
  i do n't know what any of it has to do with monetization though . 
  that 's just all speculation and rumour . 
  well that 's fucking insulting and unfounded . 
   other mods that participated in the blackout have already come forward as having been paid so it 's not that far fetched, 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  i 'd love to see actual evidence of that . 
  ps : i 'm not really sure what you think you 're achieving by downvoting my comments . 
  well , i 'll reserve judgment until i see actual evidence . 
  so why are you even talking to me then . 
  what could a `` paid off '' mod possibly say to convince you that they 're not paid off ? 
  they have put / u/krispykrackers and / u/deimorz onto improving things full time . 
  that 's a step in the right direction . 
  hopefully we 'll get more information as time passes . 
  breaking news : old white woman is kind of racist . 
  i guess it 's that time of the month where a susan g komen post gets to the top of / r/todayilearned, 
  we see these tiny snippets of the real shorten and it 's fucking fantastic . 
  where is this guy the rest of the time ? 
  i 'm sick of career politician bill shorten , i want that one . 
  i feel like being middle of the road is much easier to fake than being passionate . 
  definitely useful . 
  do n't be a dick . 
  they 're trying to help us , be reasonable . 
  yup . 
  should really be able to remove a higher mod with , say , 3/4 majority . 
  make it only available as an option to subreddits with over x number of mods/x years old/x number of subscribers so it ca n't be abused by small , new teams . 
  every subreddit i 've ever modded has worked on a team voting system . 
  even if you make it something that mods ca n't physically do themselves but allow a concrete guideline for how we could quietly petition admins to make it happen - for example , you need to make a backroom post with at least x number of mods voting and then you 'll remove them for us . 
  something like that . 
  up to mods to find and report . 
   `` show me all the past modmails to this subreddit sent by this particular user '' . 
  that would be * awesome * . 
   well that will be almost impossible unless a user brags about it . 
  that definitely used to happen a lot on askreddit . 
  but yeah , i think it 's mostly a deterrent . 
  i think this is my number 1 most frustrating problem as a user . 
  my only ability to keep someone from my subreddit is based on them caring about their karma/account . 
  or just have it search for multiple accounts that have been banned with the same ip . 
  even if we ca n't see it . 
  that 's definitely something i did n't consider and a good point . 
  i guess my experience is with large default subreddits where the overwhelming majority already want someone gone . 
  we certainly do n't want mod selection to be any more political than it already is . 
  i do think that in large defaults the squatters are ( a ) too inactive to really affect voting in a meaningful way and ( b ) there are too many mods for that to happen but i do understand the concern . 
  generally speaking , it 's the active mods who are pushing for more mods to help them with the workload * because * of the inactive mods . 
  alternatively , instead of being an ongoing option , you do a one time sweep through even just the defaults and talk to the actual active moderators to see if there are any squatters . 
  that way there 's no incentive to affect future voting . 
   pakistanis are some of the most racist , sexist and homophobic people you will ever meet . 
  not even being discriminatory , they absolutely are, 
  oh , well i guess if you 're convinced that it 's true it 's definitely not discriminatory . 
  it 's effective if they 're spamming a specific phrase but if they 're just generally being an asshole to other people it does n't really stop them . 
  quiet banning until they work it out delays things but it just becomes a game of whack-a-mole and qbing is a bit of a pain in the ass to do . 
  atziri built for leech and a bit more ignite chance ( you 'll usually have a quicksilver up as you hit the first enemy ) is nice too . 
  i also used gang 's momentum . 
  i know this is n't a satisfying answer but there is n't a hardline rule because if there was one , people could step just to the side of it . 
  let 's be honest , it 's ** extremely ** obvious when someone is promoting for personal gain as opposed to mentioning something in context . 
  if they have a ** habit ** of promoting for personal gain , it 's spam . 
  if it comes up organically or is done in the context of significant other contributions to reddit , it 's not spam . 
  the 1-10 rule is just a guideline because anyone intent enough on spamming can just easily go 1-11 . 
  i think it 's more about context . 
  it 's a sad indictment of how the userbase on reddit has changed over time . 
  i 'm not being racist but do y' all hate blacks too ? 
  dream scenario : user can set a flair from a range of options . 
  mods can then change it based on a larger set of presets . 
  once a mod has flaired something a user can no longer change the flair . 
   omg so much yes !, 
  i would kill to know how many visitors are actually reading the various wikis we painstakingly curate . 
  how many readers are actually looking at our posting policy and faq ? 
  i need this !, 
  i changed all the sidebar links to the wiki to goo.gl so i can monitor the traffic . 
  it 's cool . 
  it 's literally in the title . 
  `` leaked '', 
  i 'm a 7 ' 1 centre with no post game , could you please trade the best passer in the league ? 
  thanks . 
  this is a really clever idea . 
  they have given default mods gold several times as thank yous . 
  it 's also because having gold makes modding easier due to some of the features it offers . 
  i 'm glad they do n't give anything of actual value because that would incentivise modding for other reasons . 
  / u/krispykrackers and / u/deimorz have been put on to mod support full time . 
  they are probably the two most liked admins these days and have a long history of being extremely helpful . 
  both seem genuinely intent on improving things and have * some * resources to do it . 
  yes , alexis fucked over / u/krispykrackers by making up timelines but let 's not hold that against the two people actually trying to help . 
  `` powermods '' clearly have n't forgotten . 
  there is a lot of dialogue currently between kk/deimorz and the mods . 
  there has also been a clear message to them that we have expectations . 
  what i do n't really understand is what all you guys think the mods should actually do . 
  we shut down and said we needed things to change . 
  they have promised to make those changes and already put resources towards doing so . 
  how does stomping our feet further have ** any ** positive impact ? 
  personally , i 'd rather move forward and work on the assumption that things will improve . 
  you know why ? 
  because if i did n't , why the fuck would i still devote time and energy to moderating ? 
  seriously , if you have no faith that reddit will improve and it 's not giving you what you want right now , * just leave * . 
  it 's a website , not your country of birth . 
  go to voat or whatever .
