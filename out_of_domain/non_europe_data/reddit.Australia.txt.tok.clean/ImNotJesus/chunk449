  yishan 's was literally my favourite comment of all time . 
  it 's like watching the twist at the end of a perfect movie and they just showed the little montage of ed norton beating himself up . 
  seriously , that was my immediate reaction . 
  genuine 10 out of 10 . 
  could n't have scripted it coming full circle better . 
  i do n't really understand the point you are trying to make . 
  eh , you 're alright . 
  loved that one too . 
  how could you possibly know that ? 
  nothing improves a joke more than knowing the punchline before you start reading it . 
  yes, 
  + / u/user _ simulator imnotjesus, 
  yeah well my dad can beat up your dad . 
  needs more change.org, 
  unfortunately , all questions on the topic will be considered out of order . 
  who on your team has expertise in science ? 
  what clinical testing have you done to show that your program has these actual results and is safe ? 
  who conducted your human trials ? 
  and in what way do you believe it to be ethical to open your practice before the results of those studies are peer-reviewed and published ? 
  hello kurtcobainsbrains !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  i tried really , really hard to distance myself ( as a mod of 3 defaults that shut down ) from any of the / r/blackout2015 people . 
  well , it 's extremely difficult to get and has two huge drawbacks . 
  i 'm fine with something that hard to get having a really powerful unique effect . 
  ungil 's harmony build hype . 
  interesting . 
  even still , two huge drawbacks make it far from op in my books . 
   give ** moderators **, 
  it would be moderator only , possibly only in subs over a certain size and as admins can see who reported , it would be silly to abuse it . 
  thanks !, 
  #### speaking quietly, 
  luckily i have all three and am operating at 294 % capacity . 
  exact same thought i had . 
  this is bis for oro 's flicker . 
  misleading title is misleading . 
  all mental illness is a combination of symptoms that exist on a continuum . 
  it 's normal to feel sad , it 's a sign of illness to feel sad all the time . 
  probably a more relevant example in this case is grief . 
  it is totally normal to be upset after someone you know dies . 
  it becomes clinically diagnosable as `` complicated grief '' if there are certain diagnostic criteria stay after a long period of time . 
  similarly , it is completely normal to believe in a god . 
  you may think it 's an irrational belief but every single person in the world has irrational beliefs . 
  that does n't make someone mentally ill . 
  however , if someone 's beliefs ( of any type ) become so extreme as to cause ( a ) maladaptive behaviours and ( b ) be distressing , it can then be considered a mental illness . 
  edit : after reading the article more fully it is clear that this article is either ( an attempt at ) satire or just absolute and utter garbage . 
  leaning towards the latter . 
  i do n't think you would genuinely want people diagnosed as mentally for exhibiting behaviours that the vast majority of the world do . 
  every single person has irrational beliefs . 
  the term used is generally culturally appropriate . 
  it 's important because psychologists accept that people believe wrong things . 
  it 's not a sign of mental illness for someone to believe in astrology . 
  it 's just that they were convinced of something that is incorrect . 
  context matters . 
  yeah , still not a mental illness . 
  i get that you do n't like religion but that does n't change the definition of mental illness . 
  is n't satire supposed to be funny ? 
  spez , the current policy in place places the same importance on users who spend their time harassing other users as it does on users who just want to come here and have a good time . 
  1 ) why do you refuse to protect users who do n't want to have to deal with racism/sexism/etc . 
  in their recreation time ? 
  how is `` open discussion '' more important than that ? 
  2 ) even if you do n't profit from some of the hate groups on reddit , do n't you feel complicit in them growing given that you give them a platform to gather and share their hate speech ? 
  3 ) do you understand that culture is a thing ? 
  if you allow groups devoted to fat people hate , rascism , sexism etc. , you draw other people like that while alienating good every day users . 
  how do you intent to make reddit less toxic ? 
   if something is deemed `` offensive , '' but is consensual ( such as bdsm ) , will it be subject to removal ? 
  no reasonable adult would ban a bdsm fetish forum and consider it in the same category as / r/coontown . 
  for the record , as a mod of three defaults that shut down , we never expected input into her firing . 
  the anger was that the firing was n't communicated to us in a timely fashion and no plan was in place . 
  tl ; dr let 's pretend the shitty subreddits do n't exist . 
  so ... nothing has changed ? 
  common decency and not making every day users put up with racist scumbags ? 
  for once i 'd just wish they 'd be honest about this stuff . 
  clearly they want to make reddit more appealing to a wider audience but that 's not even necessarily a bad thing . 
  why ca n't he just say : `` yes , we want a situation where new users are n't pushed away by racist assholes and subreddits about raping women . '', 
  i like to browse all . 
  culture is also a thing . 
   a mod deleted the post because it was off topic . 
  we should say so , and we should probably be able to see what it was somehow so we can better learn the rules . 
  this is one of those `` good in theory '' ideas that would be a fucking nightmare . 
  look , it 's very simple : mods remove content for two reasons , it 's either ( a ) harmful to users/aginst sitewide rules or ( b ) it 's distracting from the intended content in that post . 
  in which of those two cases does this help ? 
  to be fair , i think he was talking about what ** should ** happen . 
  i 'm sure it 'll take steps to be ready for that change ,, 
  they 've said that in the past . 
  mods delete things because they ( a ) are harmful or ( b ) distract from the intended purpose of the post . 
  in which of those cases does this help ? 
  he can choose when to make his name red . 
  same as mods of subreddits with green . 
  mod access only . 
  should donate it to an ironic charity . 
  naacp for coontown etc. 
  as a white man , i came to reddit because it was a bastion of free memes . 
  it was a place where i could come and be judged on the dankness of my meme - not the person who said it . 
  it was a place where new ideas could be born , because nobody was afraid of expressing their honest thoughts , opinions , and theories . 
  from what i 've seen , sjws want to destroy that . 
  they care more about who you are than what you say , and if you 're not a trans-woman genderqueer attack helicoptor feminist , your memes do n't count . 
  as a white man , i hate / r/adviceanimals , but i would defend to my death their right to speak freely . 
  / u/spez , what will you do to ensure that reddit remains a dank platform for everyone ? 
  edit : ty,
