  he has always had anti-competitive practices , acted massively inappropriately for the head of a giant company , fought unions and pay rights , massively pressured people to do things against their own interest and literally owns a bible shaped like a gun . 
  he 's as conservative as you can get . 
  absolutely nothing he has done in the last few days should be a surprise to anyone . 
  his political views relate to what he sees as the role and responsibilities of business . 
   dana has publicly stated that he 's an atheist, 
  link ? 
  not at all what i said you goof . 
  remember when everyone said `` oh , bush is just going into iraq for oil '' but it never actually brought down oil prices ? 
  that 's kind of what 's happening in australia . 
  we 're fucking over poor people and destroying the environment for the sake of the economy , all while the economy falls into the shitter .

  kaom 's primacy until a better 2h rare . 
  i honestly would n't bother chancing until you have a lot more currency . 
  saving them up and trade them for chaos . 
  it 's so weird the way we protect people in most industries but then decide to let people make dangerous mistakes in others . 
  oh no , the horror of no longer taking money from poor people and giving it to rich people . 
  it will crumble society . 
  yup . 
  same reason smoking changes take so long .

  for those wondering the post breaks 3 different rules , none of which have anything to do with the fact that it 's about politics or a `` troubling issue '' . 
  going as far as the sidebar could have shown you that . 
  i hope in the future you just message us first instead of trying to post it all around reddit . 
  because it was caught by a bot , not a human . 
  smh.com.au actually, 
  yeah but i earned that house by being born in it . 
  it would help to know what skill ( s ) you are primarily planning on using . 
  besides that , i would definitely put a higher priority on + life than armor and resistances on the tree .

  it 's in / r/science , not / r/iama for anyone wondering . 
  you ca n't honestly say that the majority of pokies users see it as `` entertainment '' . 
  do you honestly believe that people play pokies for entertainment or because they think they 're going to win money ? 
  do you think anyone would willingly throw away money ? 
  does n't it then follow that anyone gambling on pokies are either ( a ) ignorant to the outcomes or ( b ) being manipulated to use it ? 
  if that 's true , how is it ethical to allow the machines ? 
  yeah but on that thing my intuition that they 're scary is right because , you know , monsanto and stuff / s, 
  fuck those assholes . 
  my beautiful son . 
  i knew i 'd love him , never realised how many times a day he 'd make me smile and laugh .

  i do n't see why you think that is relevant . 
  did you just want an excuse to link your own post ? 
  why is there a picture of zach galifianakis ? 
  definitely agree . 
  you also generally go rt and really on + ignite . 
  this seems like an obvious and overdue step . 
  thanks for letting us know that it 's finally happening . 
  what 's frustrating is that so often we 're told changes in policy are n't possible because it would be impossible for the admin team to manage the workload . 
  for example , i suggested a system of reporting to admins that was accessable to mods in their own subreddits that worked like the mod report function . 
  whether it 's true or not , every single response i got from mods ( and an ex admin ) was that it was a fantastic idea but you would never do it because it would be unfeasible to actually deal with all the rule breaking that goes on . 
  it 's frustrating , given that mods are held to account if we do n't keep our subreddits to a certain standard , that the admins are incapable of doing certain things because of a lack of staff . 
  if you were angry at a sub for not clearing out spam quickly enough and they responded by saying it was n't feasible to manage the spam with the size of their team , would you really be okay with that as an answer ? 
  i know in this case you 're planning to change the tools but `` it 's not feasible '' is n't really a satisfying answer . 
  or oro 's rt flicker, 
  your son looks very unsure about the whole thing . 
  for those saying that he 's not being racially vilified and he 's the one making it about race ** who cares ** ? 
  let 's say you 're right , let 's say that he was never originally booed because of his race . 
  he has come out and said the way that i 'm being treated by the fans is making me feel racially vilified . 
  if you choose to continue to boo him , that means you are ** intending ** to make him feel racially vilified . 
  you do n't get to choose how other people respond to things . 
  if i told you that the word qyjibo was really offensive to me , it still makes you an asshole to follow me around saying the word qyjibo , even if the word itself means nothing . 
   political correctness gone mad, 
  also known as i do n't care about feelings unless you say that i should n't say something , at which point my feelings about it become extremely important . 
  a ) it 's not criticism of him , it 's booing . 
  b ) it 's clearly genuine . 
  let 's say you 're right , let 's say that he was never originally booed because of his race . 
  he has come out and said the way that i 'm being treated by the fans is making me feel racially vilified .
