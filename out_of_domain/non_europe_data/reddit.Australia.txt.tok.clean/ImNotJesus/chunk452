  if you choose to continue to boo him , that means you are ** intending ** to make him feel racially vilified . 
  you justify it however you like buddy . 
  all i know is that if someone is telling me that they feel that something i am doing makes them feel racially vilified , i personally think that stopping that behaviour is probably a good idea . 
  if you think otherwise , go for it . 
  i 'm betting that i 'll be right more often than you though . 
  if the worst thing about me is being too sensitive to other people 's feelings i 'll take it . 
  and if you were being sincere i would apologise and change my future behaviour . 
  you 're obviously not being . 
  let 's say you 're right , let 's say that he was never originally booed because of his race . 
  he has come out and said the way that i 'm being treated by the fans is making me feel racially vilified . 
  if you choose to continue to boo him , that means you are ** intending ** to make him feel racially vilified . 
  it actually does n't matter what the original intent was . 
  let 's say you 're my friend and you make fat jokes about me . 
  i say that i 'm a bit sensitive about it and prefer you do n't . 
  it does n't matter what your ** original ** intention was , once i 've now told you that i 'm offended by it , you 're a cunt if you keep doing it . 
  you do n't get to choose how other people react to things . 
  as a 19 year old white male i 'm sure it 's really difficult for you when other people seem upset by feeling racially vilified . 
  i 'm sorry it 's such a difficult experience . 
  it 's literally the top comment in this thread . 
  amazing . 
  who said that ? 
  of course you can , that 's the whole point . 
  right , but if it 's absurd you can ignore it outright . 
  do you really , honestly believe that is making up how he feels about this ? 
  also , we 're not talking about anything with negative repercussions . 
  your day is not going to be any worse by not booing adam goodes . 
  to be fair , i do n't think anyone reasonable is saying that . 
  some are arguing that the reaction to the tpp is not based on actual evidence . 
  that people are getting very worried about a very small leak from an extremely complex piece of legislation that is several years old and on legislation that is not even finished yet . 
  at best , we can say that we do n't really know how the tpp will affect things but will know when the drafting of it is finished and it 's released to the public before being voted on . 
  bae caught me slippin, 
  come on guys , documents wo n't shred themselves . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  who would pay that ? 
  yeah but it 's much harder to have sex with a hoodie . 
  this is actually a thing that some people believe . 
  what are you planning on making ? 
  pa does a heap of damage , no reason to reduce clear speed for more damage . 
  the only reason to use trap is for slow moving bosses . 
  even then it 's a pain . 
  exactly . 
  if there 's anything to criticise shorten about it 's being * too much * of a politician .

  hello ryanss0007 !, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  we can manually flair it but do n't for two reasons :, 
  1 ) we moderate from what 's called the modqueue where we only see the titles of posts . 
  if the word serious is n't in the title things will be approved . 
  2 ) it 's not fair to all the people who have already commented . 
  lady i spoke to had a breakdown due to her abusive husband and ended up in hospital . 
  her husband was extremely supportive and lovely to her in hospital and she was n't ready to tell anyone yet . 
  proceeds to go home and have another really bad breakdown . 
  this time she quietly said to a nurse that her husband was being abusive at home . 
  the nurse said that her husband was lovely and caring and that she only thinks he 's being abusive because she 's having a breakdown , that it was n't real . 
  that really prolonged how long she was with him because she started to wonder if the nurse was right .
