  i spoke to her about a year after she left him and was doing great , she was just having a rough night and needed someone to hear her story . 
  before meeting her husband she was a very successful college graduate and was struggling day to day when we talked . 
  seriously broke my heart . 
  they do n't want to be a situation where they 're devoted huge numbers of man hours to dealing with requests though . 
  to some extent literally everything you experience is chemicals and electricity . 
  that does n't mean that it 's * necessarily * any less real or meaningful . 
  before she rejects you ? 
  give mayweather some credit , he 's beaten up more women than ronda still . 
  should n't red pillers ** love ** gay guys ? 
  women are terrible and to be despised . 
  gay guys have worked out a trick to never have to deal with them .

  it kind of looks like an excited beaver . 
  punch line . 
  i love it when you start with the, 
  1 second does n't sound like a lot until you remember that he 's an elite athlete who already knows that the fight is over . 
  he 's not just chilling out in that time either , he 's cranking the shit out of the sub . 
  if someone stayed on top raining down punches for 1 second after the ref had already moved in they would deserve a permanent ban from the sport . 
   i do n't mind terribly much about how long he holds on, 
  i do . 
  even if you do n't care about fighter safety at all and just enjoy the sport , the ** biggest ** thing that separates it from thugs in a street fight is the ref being there to stop the fight when it 's over . 
  if you actually care about the sport and not just cheering for the most possible brain damage/limb injury , you should care that the fight is over when it 's over . 
   the guy 's an asshole whether it 's intentional or not . 
  that 's the key thing here . 
  whether you smash other people with your car because you 're a terrible driver or because you 're an asshole i do n't want to share the road with you either way . 
  the greatest lie ever told is that being economically conservative is actually good for the economy . 
  economic conservatism is nothing but [ system justification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system_justification ) combined with a [ just world bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis ) and a [ social dominance orientation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_dominance_orientation ) . 
  edit : to be very clear , none of those links relate to economics because i 'm saying that economic conservatism is about psychology more than economics . 
  also , yes i understand that the dow is n't the economy . 
  system justification theory : some people are motivated to maintain the status quo because it 's less scary . 
  just world bias : things are the way they are for a reason . 
  i deserve to be rich and that guy deserves to be poor . 
  social dominancen orientation : social status is important and people that are higher in status are there for a reason . 
   freshmen psychology majors have a tendency of sounding super pretentious . 
   fortunately , i took an psych class two years ago, 
  goes on to try and explain concepts he clearly does n't understand at all . 
  thanks !, 
  not really but i can see where you 're coming from . 
  the is-ought fallacy is a claim about the way the world * ought * to be from what the world currently * is * . 
  it 's basically an argument against using science to inform moral debate which i actually disagree with . 
  just world bias is a bias in interpreting the world that we all have to different degrees . 
  we are unconsciously motivated to believe the world is n't chaotic and that there is some order to it all . 
  we therefore interpret things that happen with that hope . 
  one of the more extreme versions is victim blaming in rape . 
  she should n't have been wearing that top etc. 
   none of those links have anything to do with economics . 
  that 's my point . 
  i think people are economically conservative for psychological reasons , not because it 's actually an effective model .

  only if you want to play standard though . 
  if you play temp leagues , why save it for 6 months for it to be worth theoretically more ? 
  you could get a mjolner + voll 's and some other nice gear pretty comfortably for less than 50ex, 
  yeah but faux outrage about not enough outrage gets a lot more clicks . 
  a website full of people too racist for reddit . 
  sounds ... fun ? 
  if all of the people who are upset that they ca n't be * more * racist on reddit go to voat i would be ecstatic . 
  addition by subtraction . 
  also worth noting that they do n't seem to understand the difference between state and federal politics .

  i know in my subs we use posting history to assess whether a dubious comment is likely coming from someone who shows a lot of that behaviour or not . 
  because the quarantined subs do n't come up on toolbox history anymore their shitty behaviour is essentially hidden .
