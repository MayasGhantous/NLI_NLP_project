  he 's on to us . 
  shit . 
  i 've never understood with comk - do you build for spell damage or melee damage ? 
  which bit precisely do you think she was n't honest about ? 
  i 've talked to victoria a lot since this happened and nothing she said was not in line with any impression she has given me . 
  actually , she very clearly said that the original subreddits to close down were the owns that were heavily involved with her and it was done to work out what to do . 
  that is entirely true . 
  the first three subs to close down were / r/iama , / r/science and / r/books , the three subs who do the most amas . 
  while i ca n't talk for / r/books , i 'm a mod of the other two and that is exactly why she shut down . 
  other subs shut down later in protest of like 40 different things but she was completely right about the initial subs that shut down . 
  she then said that `` other folks wanted to join in and then it snowballed from there . '', 
  completely accurate . 
  when the subreddits were shutting down it was covered in a crazy range of extremely respected websites . 
  the / r/iama mods even did an oped in the ny times . 
  it would be extremely unprofessional for either side to say as it 's none of our business . 
   hmm , i seem to remember one of the mods from those subreddits created a thread talking about how they had been removed after they refused to reopen a closed subreddit . 
  that was a prank and not by anyone from those subs . 
  from memory it was an / r/pics mod . 
   it is not unprofessional to be honest and open . 
  you are buying into top-down corp culture if you think so . 
  we 're not employees there . 
  they do n't owe us any explanation and publishing it on the internet is not okay by any stretch of the imagination . 
  seriously . 
  the president being on is a big enough deal , no need to try and sell it . 
   i mean from a cynical standpoint , you work for the management team who is pushing the bullshit and whoever posted that thread is just some guy on the internet . 
  i 'm a volunteer . 
  i receive nothing . 
  also , it was very well chronicled at the time for the people that were n't too busy circlejerking in / r/blackout2015, 
  also , if you bothered to read my comment history you 'd see it littered with me criticizing the admins . 
  it is , in fact , my top comment of all time . 
  some people are adults who prioritise their career over creating internet drama . 
  you should probably spend some time thinking about what 's important in life . 
   are you going to state for the record that as far as you know reddit does not engage in content manipulation for its own purposes ? 
  i have never seen any credible evidence of it , no . 
  just an fyi , if you do n't make it opt-in , a lot of mods are going to be very upset .

  / r/help can help you out  thanks for the link . 
  verify your e-mail . 
  no idea then , very strange . 
  punch line . 
  i love it when you start with the, 
  it was pretty well known in the comedy community before it all came out . 
  i remember they talked about it on walking the room a few times . 
  but one black woman yelled at bernie sanders . 
  does n't that mean that all black people and all women are horrible ? 
  to be a little bit more precise . 
  three subs shut down initially ( / r/iama , / r/science and / r/books ) as they were the subs most reliant on work that victoria had in progress and had specific procedures in place that involved her . 
  all three shut down to work out what the fuck to do next , especially since the admins did n't inform any of those mods . 
  / r/iama found out that vic had been fired because someone supposed to be doing an ama sent a modmail asking why she had n't contacted them yet . 
  other major subreddits joined in because of ongoing frustrations about a significant lack of support and communication from the admins . 
  after all of that , the / r/blackout2015 crowd jumped on and decided that it was all about them . 
  it 's honestly worse than `` man up '' . 
  it 's an insidious expectation that a woman owes you sex or a relationship because you 're nice to her . 
  jesus christ that is some of the worst advice i have ever heard . 
   thank god srs is n't the problem here on reddit . 
  it 's totally all those mean little white boys . 
  i really feel for them . 
  as a middle class white male in his 20s from an affluent nation , we have been through struggles you ca n't understand . 
  you do n't understand what it 's like being told that it 's not socially acceptable to be racist and sexist anymore . 
  where are my freedoms ? 
  look , racism and sexism are over so anywhere i have been more successful than women or black men is entirely due to me being superior and deserving . 
  nice copypasta but it would have helped to read what i wrote first . 
  i never defended srs , i just think playing the victim card as a white male is hilarious .
