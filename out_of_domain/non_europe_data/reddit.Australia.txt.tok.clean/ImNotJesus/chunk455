   considering srs thinks everyone who disagrees with them must be a white male, 
  ** the phrase i quoted literally referred to being a white male ** . 
  i get that you have this whole internet warrior thing going on in your head that makes this feel meaningful but do n't project your dumb internet battles onto me . 
  votes are artificially deflated for a bunch of reasons . 
  they recently changed one part of that process so that they 're deflated less . 
  wrong . 
  admins have confirmed otherwise . 
  just an fyi , the / r/iama mods had nothing to do with it being moved there . 
  since firing victoria , the admin team have a bit of a habit of deciding which subreddits people should be posting their amas to . 
  there 's also much more talking up how much they 're helping but much less of the actual helping ( as well as claims like they made about ronda today ) . 
  really excited to see who you 've got in the pipeline !, 
  oh definitely did n't want to imply that . 
  you guys have always been fantastic to deal with . 
  just thought i 'd mention it to let everyone know what 's going on . 
  alexis making comments like that reflects badly on us unfortunately . 
  not all ladies like marathon humping . 
  also , she said below that it did n't include foreplay . 
  yeah , it 's the fit bit stopping you from doing that ... 
  i love the idea of you marking it down in a notebook as you 're orgasming just for scientific accuracy . 
  is enhance actually that useful these days ? 
  most quality bonuses were nerfed pretty hard . 
  what would you use it on ? 
  how about an instant detonation keystone ? 
  that 's enlighten . 
  enhance boosts quality . 
  wow that looks fantastic . 
  yeah but you at least give the mods of the sub the choice whether to try and explain that to their users . 
  not really but okay . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can click off ignore reports and then refresh the page . 
  it 's not ideal though .

  ** this is exactly what the alp wanted . 
  ** bringing same sex marriage to a vote was a no-lose situation for them . 
  there were 3 alternatives : ( 1 ) abbott says no to a conscience vote , looks bad , it 's an election issues , ( 2 ) abbott allows conscience vote , it passes , labor get to say that it took the opposition to bring forward this landmark bill or ( 3 ) abbott allows conscience vote , it gets voted down , alp say that if you elect them they 'll guarantee it passes in the first 100 days of government ( as they already decided at the conference ) . 
  this was an absolutely fantastic piece of political maneuvering that has absolutely nothing to do with the well-being of anyone except for politicians . 
  i feel icky just writing all of that . 
  hooray for career politician bill shorten .

   i just hope the change will help most players move out of the 68-73 trench, 
  i think i might have been unlucky but for a couple of days i 've been alching every 71-73 and am having to sell sets of 3 70s to run 71s . 
  as a dog , woof . 
   commence the circlejerk !, 
  ooo so edgy and original . 
  we do n't restrict amas based on topic . 
  people can ask whatever they want ( within reason ) and it 's his choice what to answer . 
  hi richard and thanks for doing this ama . 
  while your party is the * most * aware of science of any of the parties , you seem to still be quite backward in some areas . 
  in particular , your position on gmos is as behind the times as tony on climate change . 
  do you have any plans to better communicate with the actual scientists on these issues ? 
   given your background as a physician do you stand by the greens policy that gmo 's `` pose significant risks to ... human health . '' , given this has never been shown to be the case ? 
  yup . 
  this is about as backward is tony 's climate change policies . 
  the overwhelming majority of scientists in the area consider gm foods to be significantly safer than non-gm foods . 
  this is partly because all farmers genetically modify their foods ( deliberately or accidentally ) over time with no oversight . 
  deliberate modification of genes by experts is actually far safer because they ( a ) know what they are doing and ( b ) test things . 
  i know the whole `` unnatural = scary '' is intuitively easy but it 's just wrong here . 
  and as a party who claims to care about science , it would be fantastic to see them admit that their policy was wrong and update it . 
  hell , that 's what science is about . 
  you learn new information and update what you think you know about the world . 
  i would have immense respect for them . 
   i 'm ok with gmo labelling, 
  why ? 
  it 's a terrible policy . 
  but it 's no better . 
  there 's no evidence that it is any of those things . 
  in fact , by many estimates , gm foods are our best chance of providing specifically needed nutrients to people in third world countries ( like golden rice ) and addressing future issues of food availability . 
   regarding the health risks : i 'm guided by the science . 
  when there is a scientific consensus that there are zero health risks , then our policy should change to reflect that . 
  our policies are reviewed regularly . 
  however , it 's still early days and it is still premature to assert that there are no health risks at all . 
  richard i 'm sorry but this is massively disappointing . 
  you 're doing the equivalent of saying `` yeah but how do we know that humans are causing global warming '' on this issue . 
  there 's no debate within scientists . 
  gm foods are empirically safer than non-gm foods . 
  the only debate is within people who do n't understand the issues . 
  i implore you to seek advice from real scientists on this topic because this is an embarrassing stance . 
  edit : to be clear , there is absolutely nothing with zero risk . 
  that 's an impossible bar . 
  there is however over 2,000 published papers to say that gmos are as safe or ** safer ** than non-gmo food . 
  of course gmo needs regulation but so does medicine and we do n't withhold antibiotics while waiting for the 2,001 st safety report to come out . 
  [ citation required that is n't the widely debunked seralini paper ], 
  people have the right to know what 's in their food . 
  even if we know it 's 100 % not going to hurt them , i still think it 's reasonable that this information should be available . 
  have a read of this : [ 1 ] ( http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2012/06/06/why-labeling-of-gmos-is-actually-bad-for-people-and-the-environment/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/labels-for-gmo-foods-are-a-bad-idea/ ) or [ 3 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/08/25/why-liberal-americans-are-turning-against-gmo-labeling/ ) . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  do you think it would be reasonable to put a label on all apples that says `` this apple contains cyanide '' ? 
  in the quantities that remain in your food ? 
  no , it 's empirically not dangerous . 
  if you drink pesticide you 're not going to have a great time but that does n't mean that a fragment more of it will hurt you . 
  there 's radiation in bananas and cyanide in apples , have too much of either of those and you 're going to have a bad time . 
  eating two bananas instead of one wo n't cause a tumor though . 
   a significant risk is that it out competes native plants if it releases into the wild for instance . 
  and like he said , that the ip can be abused .
