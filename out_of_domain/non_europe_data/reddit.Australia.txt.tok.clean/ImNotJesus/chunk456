  i am also pro gmo , but i 'm not going to say that there are zero risks like you seem to be suggesting either . 
  i have never said that there is 0 risk and an intelligent policy surrounding the legalities of gmo is obviously warranted . 
  but to have a policy against gmos because of perceived health risk is simply an anti-science position . 
  enjoy . 
  which is already extremely well established . 
  there have been [ over 2,000 published papers on the topic ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/09/17/the-debate-about-gmo-safety-is-over-thanks-to-a-new-trillion-meal-study/ ), 
  and when did i say that because of those 2,000 studies we should n't have any regulations or standards ? 
  there is risk whenever you give people something to ingest and of course we always need to be careful and have regulations but at this stage it 's absurd to take the position that gmos are inherently dangerous . 
   if that 's true , what science is guiding you ? 
  is n't `` it feels icky '' science ? 
   i have a scientific background as a doctor as do many members , supporters and staff . 
  which is what makes your stance on gmos particularly disheartening . 
  i 'll still vote greens because i think you 'll be on the right side of history on a lot more issues but i implore you to spend some time talking to the scientists who actually research this area . 
  or , just do some [ reading ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/09/17/the-debate-about-gmo-safety-is-over-thanks-to-a-new-trillion-meal-study/ ) . 
  not an expert in this area , can you please explain how that relates to roundup specifically ? 
  there 's an enormous amount of evidence suggesting that increasing roundup uptake is n't harmful so i 'm curious about this . 
   the insect resistance had a domino effect , tho : less insects meant fewer frogs and so on , until the water quality and security of bali was seriously compromised . 
  do you have a reference for that ? 
  i 'd be interested to read more . 
   does nobody live near farms where it is sprayed ? 
  because there has already been a lot of health issues caused to people in those areas over the years , increasing the amount that is sprayed is simply less safe , it might not be a big difference , in fact it might be an incredibly small difference , but you should stop claiming otherwise . 
  [ citation required ], 
  as i 've said elsewhere , i do n't think many people are advocating for a regulation free environment . 
  of course there should be rules for how gmos are governed that consider environment implications . 
  however , the mention of `` human health '' suggests that the senator is extremely wrong on this issue . 
  there are over 2,000 published papers that say gmos are as safe or safer than conventional and organic foods . 
  so you do n't think it would be reasonable to label that an apple contains cyanide ? 
  do n't i have the right to know that it has a deadly chemical in it ? 
   he 's stated that the health risk to humans is one of three facets to this issue . 
  you keep making it seem as if it is the only aspect . 
  if abbott was asked about climate change and he said `` there are economic issues involved we need to consider thoroughly and i 'm just not convinced all of the science is in '' which part would you focus on ? 
  not all are freely available if you do n't have university access . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/09/17/the-debate-about-gmo-safety-is-over-thanks-to-a-new-trillion-meal-study/ ) for a starting point . 
  this outta be good . 
  please do explain further . 
  actually i signed an nda when i beta tested the iama app over a year ago . 
  also , what do you think an nda is ? 
  punch line . 
  thank god you did n't surprise me with the, 
  unless it 's in reddit 's interest to have all of the less desirable users migrate . 
  it would ( a ) improve reddit and ( b ) make voat a ticking racist timebomb . 
  generally speaking , you do n't get banned unless you 're an asshole , break the rules over and over or do something destructive . 
  it 's very easy to avoid . 
  very glad to hear it but more saying that for everyone else 's benefit . 
  maybe * you * are . 
  we did n't want to say it but since you 're here , you were the one that prompted this rule reminder . 
  you should gild this comment so i can use it as an example . 
  edit : thank you kind stranger, 
  edit 2 : wow i ca n't believe this finally happened, 
  edit 3 : i 'd like to thank the academy, 
  edit 4 : fuck the pandas, 
  oh , buddy , i was just messing with you . 
  we have like several rule breaking posts per minute . 
  [ no ... ] ( http://s188.photobucket.com/user/marchof1000/media/506239d5818e5e48a3b03df3896cc931.gif.html ), 
  so edgy, 
  but what if the totes dreamy guy in my class was like `` hey '' and i was like `` hey '' and now i 'm not sure if he likes me or if it was more of a friend `` hey '' . 
  he forgot to swap accounts . 
  do n't tell any admins . 
  would n't you ? 
  are you sure we did n't in this one ? 
  well ... did you blow him ? 
  do n't leave us in suspense . 
  wait right there , it 's coming . 
  i ca n't stand by and watch stuff like this happen around here . 
  i will not support subverses ( by featuring them or making them defaults ) with moderators who impose questionable rules such as `` your post has to end with a questionmark '' . 
  moderators need to calm their tits and focus on nurturing and growing their communities . 
  rules can always be bent and what better time to bend the rules then now , while voat is still growing and under development ? 
  i am thankful for moderators who help keep voat spam-free and i respect your work . 
  i really do . 
  i started working on automoderator for comments and submissions and your job will be made much easier when this is implemented , but for the time being , moderators need to relax and focus on removing spam and eventual illegal content . 
  if i submit a new post and it gains some traction ( hundreds of comments , views and upvoats ) , and my post gets removed because i broke a rule by forgetting to include a question mark in my submission title ... well , i would be pissed . 
  people take removal of their comments and submissions very seriously and moderators must think twice before removing stuff if they want to avoid offending users . 
  voat has a ranking process where time acts as gravity and older posts will eventually fall off the frontpage . 
  voat also has automatic public moderation logs and everything you remove will still be visible in these modlogs and your actions may be questioned by the community , just like what happened yesterday . 
  this action can be reverted if / askvoat mods can convince us that the issue has been dealt with or if some other , less restrictive community takes over .
