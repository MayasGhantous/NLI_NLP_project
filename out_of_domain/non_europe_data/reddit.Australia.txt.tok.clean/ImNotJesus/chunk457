  i honestly think that the quarantining is working . 
  it 's driving people off-site , mostly to voat by the looks of it .

  i 'm really surprised that a subreddit where users and mods almost all have a financial stake in what news comes out eventually had censorship dramas . 
  i 'm just shocked that people make motivated decisions about unregulated currencies that are entirely reliant on perceptions of value . 
  unregulated currencies are totally immune to manipulation because no big corporations are involved . 
  that and unicorns . 
  also , i ca n't not link this in a bitcoin srd post - it makes all of this drama too much fun : [ link ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitbeans/imihcgcfconccnapamakpnjaiaflnpcj?hl=en ),

  it 's worse than a pyramid scheme . 
  pyramid schemes have actual products . 
  unless your blog is ifl `` science '' , i doubt that . 
  people who like different things to me are the worst . 
  so why do you give a fuck that it 's warbands ? 
  beta means that it 's a standardized coefficient so the units themselves do n't matter whereas b-weights are in the form of whatever they were measured in ( if you 're measuring inches and centimetres , your b-weights will be different but your beta weights will be identical ) . 
  both are fairly small but significant effect sizes in this case . 
  which was it ? 
  hundreds of thousands or brazilians ?

  i highly doubt they lied . 
  they probably just did n't realise that scrapping the carbon tax would most benefit businesses in the short term and would n't actually help the average household . 
  i 'm sure it was just an oversight . 
  i heard on the bolt report that watching the abc uses more power than channel 10 and could be responsible for these high power bills .

   the award to abbott came as a surprise , particularly to those who had seen him up close on the src . 
  one jibe at the time was , ` second-grade footballer , third-rate academic and fourth-class politician .

  hello zaner95 !, 
  i 've removed your submission from iama . 
  location-based amas go to [ / r/ilivein ] ( http://reddit.com/r/ilivein ) . 
  lpt : be less obvious when gaming reddit . 
  that 's it , i 'm moving to / v/subversedrama, 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  the voat drama is the best . 
  the top mod of / v/askvoat has been accused of being an sjw . 
  he said that was a goal . 
  they do n't have the tools to do anything else yet . 
  lpt : inhale ** then ** exhale . 
  the guy on the right is a redditor . 
  he posts on / r/mma . 
  shit , they 're literally bringing out a war veteran . 
  abbott has been studying his republican playbook . 
  i love teaching my students about split-brain surgery . 
  it really messes with people 's notion of what the brain is . 
  / v/askvoat is a great read right now . 
  this is definitely true because i always take photos on my phone by holding it as far away from me as possible . 
  there 's a big difference between people who already have a product using reddit to engage with their community and someone trying to monetize a subreddit though . 
  this is an article written by the author of a recent scientific paper ( published in one of the top journals in the world ) about why people oppose gmos . 
  hi acidburns , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement .

  i do n't think you know what the word fact means . 
  but chia seed has [ phenylalanine in it ] ( https://badscidebunked.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/food-babe-selling-toxic-product-nutiva-chia-seeds/ ), 
  fantastic article about the limitations of statistics in science and why it 's so difficult to do good science . 
  obviously because they 're lazy / s, 
  it 's also worth pointing at that there is a huge gulf between a specific extract from a drug is good at killing a certain cell in a petri dish and smoking a joint . 
  aspirin is good for a headache but that does n't mean that eating tree bark is healthy . 
  why would potential clinical use have any impact on whether people should be able to smoke it ? 
  we do n't legalise heroine just because painkillers are effective . 
  that 's not to say that weed should n't be legalised , i just find the logic weird .
