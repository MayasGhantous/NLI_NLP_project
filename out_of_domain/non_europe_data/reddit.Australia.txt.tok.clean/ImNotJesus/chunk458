  really ? 
  taking away * some * types of assault rifles is a dealbreaker for you ? 
  also , it decreases the incentive to mistreat prisoners . 
  yeah , i realise , does n't change my point . 
   knowing that let them steal 99 % of the currency on the server . 
  how is it stealing if they 're using game mechanics available to everyone ? 
  no one is losing , they 're just investing wisely . 
  i do n't really understand this logic at all . 
  it 's now cheaper to produce end-game gear . 
  that means that there 's more competition for end-game gear and it 's therefore cheaper for average players . 
  even if you ca n't afford those rares , there 's less desire for high end uniques so the price of * them * goes down too . 
  so , sure , in conventional terms it costs more chaos to get an exalt but it 'll cost way fewer exalts to get gg rares or uniques . 
   it 's a little bit disappointing that none of the master mods will be adjusted to chaos : the skyrocketing price of exalts in respect to all other currency has made any build enabling unique much harder to farm for , which hurts everyone . 
  i expect the prices of those will drop though . 
  if you have easier access to gg rares then the second tier ( few ex costing ) uniques are going to drop in price . 
  i love the idea that they go to a restaurant and someone starts choking . 
  he gets up and yells `` we had a deal - why are you still looking at him ? '', 
  i know my dogs get antsy if they do n't get enough outside time . 
  as he says , he 's an attractive ( and obviously very secure ) man . 
  he 's right to have high standards , he seems like a catch . 
  it 's about letting your partner know your expectations / s. 
  i just discovered nihilism and i 'm anti-social = i must be a sociopath,

  why is support only good ? 
  while anti-social personality disorder is in fact a mental illness , your statement is not correct . 
  anti-social still has a lay meaning .

  why would n't you ? 
  it 's extremely powerful . 
  how does dual totem work ? 
  do you cast desecrate to get it going ? 
  good for him though . 
  that 's because america has n't reached critical gun mass yet . 
  apparently , if people have enough guns they eventually cancel each other out . 
  it 's kind of like mr burns with illnesses , or so i understand . 
  ** there is no way anyone could have possibly seen this coming !, 
  australia 's flawless plan of `` dig more shit out of the ground and hope china wants it forever '' did n't fix the economy ? 
  i am ** shocked ** . 
  ** there is no way anyone could have possibly seen this coming !, 
  australia 's flawless plan of `` dig more shit out of the ground and hope china wants it forever '' did n't fix the economy ? 
  i am ** shocked ** . 
  some sort of alternative energy source that would take jobs to create and allow us to be innovators and world leaders . 
  shame that 's all just a pipe dream . 
  on the plus side , all those ex-csiro employees can get pretty good wages if they move to wa to work in a mine . 
   we have to remember after the crash of 2007 nothing was fixed , the banks got help and business continued as normal . . means we are set up for the same thing again but even greater , not looking forward to this one . . its down 3 % as i write this . 
  australia 's economy survived relatively well during the gfc because we dig shit out of the ground . 
  china do n't need as much of what we dig out of the ground anymore . 
  that 's a problem . 
  ** do n't panic ** . 
  the australian government will fix this by making poor people pay to go to the doctor and greater subsidies to mining companies because of reasons . 
  it will all be fine . 
  just build your house out of coal , prices are about to plummet . 
  you want people to lose their jobs and homes ? 
  you sound like a charmer . 
  as coal prices plummet we obviously just need * more * coal . 
  if it 's worth half as much , you need just double the amount to make the same money . 
  that 's just obvious . 
  so now all we do is send those csiro scientists down to work in the mines and all our problems are solved . 
  the prices are obviously going to plummet , we just need to dig out twice as much . 
  that 's just logical . 
  while this is all fantastic , this is the most important part of the article . 
   `` the protocol is not a legal process , '' mr yegles wrote . 
  `` it is an administrative process . 
  it has no standing in law . 
  the afp is not bound by that protocol nor do they fall under any legal obligations to refer to it . '', 
  this will certainly embarrass the government and the afp but in no way compels them to act or is legally binding . 
  only 90s kids will get this .

  i ca n't wait to get a level 20 empower from gift of the gemling queen, 
  i love that both of our first thoughts was to still put it on poison arrow . 
  you could make any spell insane with a level 20/21 empower and both of our minds go to a more damaging poison cloud . 
  mystery solved, 
  interesting !, 
  i * was * joking but thanks for the reply anyway . 
  cool info . 
  i tend to make my builds quite unique heavy so i need lots of resists on my jewellery . 
   9 times .

  i 'd love to have something specific to use . 
  thanks,
