  you do n't need to take it so personally . 
  cast on crit builds do n't really care about local phys damage . 
  they want local crit and attack speed with spell damage/multi . 
  i see you also play on potato settings . 
  also , it could be a skin transfer but that looks like a pledge to me . 
  hi nbrogi , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3jh33h/illustrated_history_of_soviet_space_programs/ ) . 
   one burning question that comes up in skeptical circles is whether or not people who believe in the paranormal , are highly religious , or are enamored of conspiracy theories think differently than skeptics . 
  obviously they have different beliefs , but the question is whether or not their brains function differently in some respects from people who are more rational and scientific . 
   2 ) poor kids . 
  that 's the problem . 
  these kids did nothing to deserve having ignorant parents . 
  same here buddy . 
  also makes me d/c slightly less . 
  exactly . 
  what other endeavour spends 5 years and thousands of man hours trying to find faults in itself ? 
  was n't there a recent study that said that neuro studies have about 8 % of the power needed to find results based on their effect sizes ? 
  all of the papers they used were social and cognitive psych . 
  one thing that you did n't really talk about in your paper that i 'd like to discuss is a cultural change in how we present exploratory data . 
  while pre-registering is useful , i think it 's actually targeting a symptom and not a cause . 
  there would be no incentive to p-hack or adjust your hypotheses if it were culturally appropriate to talk about exploratory results . 
  if i do a study looking for x and instead find y , i ca n't get published unless i say that i was looking for y all along . 
  if we move towards a system where i can say `` i did n't find x but possibly found an interesting novel result that we should try to replicate '' we still get the potentially novel and useful information while retaining intellectual and scientific integrity . 
  do you think a shift like that is possible ? 
  sure but it 's as if you turned up to a protest about racism because you 're worried about tax rates . 
  then when everyone talked about racism you were offended that the tax rates issue was n't covered . 
  1 ) despite what alexis stupidly said in an interview years ago , the idea that you can say anything on reddit has simply never been true . 
  [ 7 year old example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd?context=3 ), 
  2 ) admins have consistently said that moderators can use whatever criteria they want for banning users as it 's their sub and they can decide who has access . 
  admins do n't support that strategy but oversight into what each subreddit does in terms of banning is impossible and impractical . 
  3 ) they 've already said they 're working towards an alternative solution but i agree it 's overdue . 
  4 ) okay ? 
  5 ) moderators invite other people with known track records that they trust . 
  if i moderate with someone in a default , i have a huge amount of data about how good a moderator they will be . 
  if you run any company , you 're going to take someone with ( a ) experience and ( b ) references from other people with experience over unknown others . 
  6 ) all meta subs lead to some harassment issues . 
  even bestof . 
  i do n't know if there 's an easy answer to this one . 
  7 ) you only think it 's unfair because it applies to things you like . 
  8 ) reddit should do what 's in their business interest and not pick fights with nations just to impress people who fetishize free speech . 
  9 ) it 's trivially easy to make a throwaway e-mail account . 
  10 ) you think subreddits devoted to making fun of and harassing other users are okay ? 
  personally , i care more about the rights of users to experience a harassment free reddit experience than i care for the rights of people who ca n't enjoy reddit without being a racist/misogynystic/fat hating/etc . 
  asshole . 
  this is a website people use for recreation , they should n't have to put up with abuse from assholes just because you get your jollies from it . 
  the royal ` you ', 
  for the sake of argument , let 's say that reddit * did * have that stance . 
  obviously what they 've said publicly is inconsistent but let 's assume their stance was `` all racism and hate speech is okay '' . 
  is your position that no one should ever change and grow from new information ? 
  your entire point seems to be that they said a in the past but are now saying b. 
  who cares ? 
  i can clearly remember telling my dad that hanson was the best band ever and i would never think otherwise . 
  i 'm pretty glad i changed my opinion on that . 
  i would find it much more depressing if reddit never grew and adapted based on new information ( which they did for way too long on this issue ) . 
  do n't forget to make your comments about how men are clearly superior to women because of this enormous sample size of 1 . 
  the elephant in the room is that you 're a misogynistic cockbag ? 
  you seem to have a tenuous understanding of the word fact . 
  right , no one is claiming that it 's sexist to say that this thing happened . 
  it 's likely a result of already existing sexism if you take this sample size of exactly 1 to make conclusions about half of the world 's population . 
  so what was the intention or underlying message of your original comment ? 
  why would anyone possibly think it was sexist to state that a thing happened with no assumptions made about what that means ? 
  i never said that . 
  i asked what you were trying to achieve with that comment . 
  what were you trying to communicate ? 
  to add to this , the overwhelming majority of research says that stigamitizing weight leads to ** poorer ** health choices . 
  so , to be clear , even if your daughter * did * have a problem with her weight , your wife making her feel bad for being overweight would be likely to have the ** exact opposite effect ** . 
  she retaliates by buying magnums . 
  -213 i think this is a record for me . 
  i normally delete in a situation like this because it 's just unpleasant having your inbox filled with assholes being assholes but i just want to see how it goes this time . 
  i 'm mostly just shocked by how bad the comments/voting are . 
  normally it levels out after a while . 
  that 's an obvious troll though . 
  did ellen or alexis get close to that ? 
  i ca n't imagine anyone ever beating it . 
  karmanaut did deserve it though . 
  following the rules of his own subreddit , what a fucking monster . 
  til is a shithole . 
  nope . 
  even if you could stand up with her on you like that ( you would n't ) , notice his left arm under her underarm ? 
  that 's in a perfect spot for an armbar . 
  that 's jiu jitsu she is using . 
  it is extremely effective . 
  is this also part of the repost started pack ? 
  i just love that this guy thinks that 6 bikers blocking his car and then refusing to move them is n't aggressive . 
  he also stated that his friends were all huge and that if the guy had n't been polite they would 've kicked his ass . 
  real charmer . 
  sure but it 's a `` rule '' of comedy that high status should n't make fun of low status . 
  in * most * situations , making fun of a person for being low status will be uncomfortable for everyone involved . 
  wonderful case of science self-monitoring in a way that organic farming does n't . 
  this study is one of the many reasons why gmo crops are safer than traditional farming methods . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  in this day and age i really think we should move past segregated beaches . 
  what an insane comment . 
  i 'm for universal healthcare but that does n't mean that i need to personally shell out the billions of dollars required of it . 
  he was fucking with you , pal . 
   dudes bending over backwards to avoid admitting gender ** and race ** based discrimination actually exists, 
  really close but now we 've got it . 
  it 's mods who are ruining this website .
