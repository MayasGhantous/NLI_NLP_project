  no one is . 
  she 's an incredible athlete who had a quick burst of popularity on reddit . 
  they were joking that the `` circlejerk '' for her on reddit is so strong that saying anything bad about her leads to downvotes . 
  o / well completed !, 
  i thought he was talking about patrick c\u00f4t\u00e9, 
  [ bearly ] ( http://rs1img.memecdn.com/the-bears-bearly-doing-ok_o_407915.jpg ), 
  i was n't aware that if you opted to donate your organs that you were mandated to be against medical research . 
  why are you here then ? 
  maybe ? 
  based on my understanding of quicksand from cartoons , they 're all dead now right ?

  proof ? 
  you 'd know better than us what sort of proof is available to you for your post . 
  [ here 's a link to the section of our wiki that discusses proof ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/wiki/index#wiki_4._what_constitutes_.22proof.22.3f ) . 
  if you do n't have proof you could also consider / r/casualiama which requires no proof . 
  this is completely politically motivated and a wildly anti-science move . 
  [ he 's a really good explanation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/3hih02/why_people_oppose_gmos_even_though_science_says/cu8fbhm?context=3 ), 
  [ that 's simply not true ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer/ ) . 
  also , as pointed out above , just being carcinogenic does n't mean that it 's dangerous . 
  apples contain cyanide but no one is expecting a sticker on every apple pointing that out . 
  dosage matters . 
   if in 30 years when we have fully mapped the human body 's chemical processes and we understand the chemical intermingling that occurs between different substances then you can say that this anti science move but until then it 's better to be safe than riddled with cancer or some other ailment . 
  except you do n't have that standard for anything else . 
  chemicals that are added through gene manipulation are n't magical . 
  they 're just chemicals . 
  i want 30 years of published work on dihydrogen monoxide . 
  that they 're frustrated by pseuodscience pushing back the flourishing of human well-being based on ignorance of science ? 
  it 's a weird saying but i guess oddly apt here . 
  as soon as they add `` contains cyanide '' labels to apples and `` contains radiation '' to bananas . 
  it literally corrodes metal and is used in floor cleaner yet we feed it to our infants . 
  what do you think happens in traditional farming techniques ? 
  genes change . 
  sometimes deliberately , sometimes accidentally but genes change every generation . 
  you know what 's safer than guessing which genes change ? 
  being really , really careful about which genes change and doing extensive testing on the effects of it . 
  just look at the [ `` poison potato '' ] ( http://boingboing.net/2013/03/25/the-case-of-the-poison-potato.html ) . 
  yup . 
  anyone who disagrees with you is a sockpuppet or shill . 
  there 's no way someone could be on the other side of the debate unless they were paid to be because your position is just so overwhelmingly rational and clearly right . 
  i just ca n't imagine why someone would care about scientific evidence over your personal opinion unless monsanto were literally paying them to do so . 
  because there is n't . 
  \\ #dosagematters without a space . 
  call shill when you do n't have evidence much ? 
  yeah , i had no idea what neil degrasse tyson 's position on gmos was before your comment other than that i assumed that him being scientifically literate made him more likely to support them . 
  hey i 'll pay you $ 500 to drink an 8 ounce glass of cyanide . 
  if you refuse , you 're never allowed to eat an apple again . 
  abbott killed my brother and ** i will have my vengeance ** . 
  hi xsmoothx , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3k286j/stonehenge_archaeologists_find_huge_neolithic/ ) . 
   ** in each conference **, 
  the part that most of these comments are missing ( partly due to an unclear title ), 
  the title is extremely unclear . 
  most of the comments are assuming that . 
  i think they 're trying to suggest that ( like every other human in the world - some more than others ) you are not great at seeing the other side of an argument . 
  even if you think you are right , perhaps you could make efforts to make sure that your partner ( or whoever ) feels heard in their argument , even if you think they 're wrong . 
  well , unless they 're making a statement of fact , it 's never black and white . 
  so you can start by trying to see if there are elements of truth . 
  to make someone feel heard though , you need to do two things ; ( 1 ) ask questions and ( 2 ) acknowledge how they feel . 
  you can be `` right '' in an emotional argument but they 're still not wrong for feeling the way they feel . 
  ask them about how they feel and you might discover that you either change your opinion or help them understand their own feelings better . 
  yeah , that 's a tricky one . 
  not much you can do there . 
  settle down buddy . 
  firstly , everyone is biased towards their already held beliefs . 
  there 's a whole bunch of social and cognitive psychology devoted to it . 
  secondly , i did n't say anything about not being `` respectful and calm '' . 
  there are plenty of extremely calm and respectful people who do a terrible job of seeing when they 're wrong . 
  third , i specifically stated that people differ in their ability to see the other side of someone 's argument . 
  lastly , i hardly think someone who made your comment is in any position to comment on social skills . 
  i know you 're really excited that you did an intro philosophy class but that does n't really apply to what i was talking about . 
  it can be both !, 
  what if i told you that arguments with friends/loved ones did n't need to be that combative ? 
  seriously , when abbott is making you look bad on refugee matters you 've got a problem . 
  hi anothercarguy , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone .

  this is the bit that is n't being talked about enough . 
  i can forgive ignorance , even if it 's someone who should know better . 
  lots of people are wrong about lots of things . 
  this makes it ** abundantly ** clear that abbott 's opposition to fighting global warming is n't his ignorance on the topic , it 's a deliberate attempt to profit from destroying the planet . 
  that is 100x more despicable than an asshole making a joke . 
  abbott laughing is the bit that is n't being talked about enough .

  i ca n't even finish it . 
  this just makes me feel a little bit sad . 
  despite the news being full of stories about the world plunging into a violent mess , the reality is that we 're just more aware of violence than ever before . 
  we live in the safest world that has ever existed .
