  hi john-pops , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3kmyo0/stretchable_metal_has_been_developed_by/ ) . 
   there seems to be a schism between the mods of this subreddit . 
  you appear to be the one moderator with his ass directly positioned on his face . 
  i really do hope you are kicked from the mod team . 
  nothing is worse than a corporate shill among free thinking skeptics . 
   either you 're being used or you 're one of them . 
   you do n't find it suspicious that suddenly , on 911 , you get this doxx information ? 
  which i do n't even know what it is . 
  just some vague accusation . 
   it 's not a vague accusation . 
   he timing was weird , certainlty . 
   flytape found the docs after years of digging . 
   they 're 1099 's which link ae911truth to 911bogger directly . 
  tens of thousands of dollars allie . 
  this is real . 
  people work for a living . 
  orangutan posts so much that what he/she has posted on 911 is a minor thing . 
  but this is clearly an op to attack the 911 truth movement and to block the information they produce . 
  how else does someone get someone else 's 1099 , except as a deep , state backed op ? 
  especially someone as private as orangutan . 
  hell , i do n't even know his/her gender . 
   i appreciate your cunning wit and intellect allie but i think you 're wrong . 
  this is like conspiratard porn . 
  they think of themselves as little detectives , it 's so cute . 
   tens of thousands of dollars allie . 
  this is real . 
  i imagined that part in a parking garage at night . 
  well i 'm not closing my eyes any time soon . 
  it 's cute that they think there will be an abbott government after canning . 
  bush, 
  it was funnier when it was n't us . 
  stealing a joke by steele saunders :, 
   ok , so you boo adam goodes for non racial reasons . 
   but if your ghost dress up party was next to a klan rally , would you keep your sheet on ?

  what 's the point in replacing him then ? 
  might as well run with abbott and kick him out after he gets slaughtered next election . 
  definitely his fault st kilda did n't win a grand final . 
  look how good we were as soon as he left , we were being held back !, 
  found the original . 
  yeah , i heard he bombed . 
  because it was really hard sometimes but that did n't make either of us want it any less . 
  scrubs addressed this really nicely but otherwise there 's this perception through media that a perfect relationship is one where things are always easy . 
  it 's just not possible . 
  if you never fight or have disagreements , that 's actually kind of a problem . 
  what really matters is how well you can communicate and adapt . 
  not silly . 
  a lot of people never notice it . 
  wait , wait , wait , wait . 
  let me get this straight . 
  you are comparing the bravery of shunning the tide of political correctness and valiantly booing an indigenous person to not being involved in apartheid ? 
  let me put it this way . 
  let 's say that i 'm overweight and we 're mates . 
  you make a crack about my weight and i let you know that i 'm actually really sensitive about it so even though i know it 's light-natured ribbing , it still really hurts my feelings . 
  if at that point you decide to still make fun of my weight , you 're deciding that you want to hurt my feelings . 
  now you may think that i 'm unreasonable in being offended but it does n't matter . 
  you 're deciding on a course of action knowing that it will hurt me . 
  not intending to hurt me is now irrelevant . 
  in the same way , you ca n't boo goodes anymore without it being perceived as racist . 
  if both your boo and the racist person 's boo are felt identically , is there actually a meaningful difference at this stage ? 
  can he at this stage ? 
  surely it 's too late . 
  yeah they were cruising in to a victory until this . 
  could you imagine if our first ** and ** second female pms were the result of leadership spills ? 
  falling off a boat and drowning ? 
  he turned back the boats but he could n't turn back his own party . 
  that 's why he was trying to make sure there were n't many around . 
  sneaky womenses . 
  he turned back the boats but he could n't turn back his own party . 
  that would be amazing . 
  salt the earth tone , salt it . 
  there once was a man named tone ,, 
  who gave his whole country the bone . 
  he pissed off the nation, 
  on each tv station, 
  and now his coop has been flown . 
  for the confused :, 
  in australia , you do n't vote for the leader , you vote for members of a party . 
  the party that has the most members in parliament picks who the leader is . 
  of course , before each election the party lets you know who the prime minister would be but , in theory , they are allowed to change the prime minister to any sitting member . 
  this is especially delicious because he won the last election on the back of tearing into the previous government who had this happen too . 
  also , for those not so aware of tony abbott . 
  these clips should tell you everything you need to know . 
  he ** was ** ( yay ) our george bush .
