  na na na goodbye, 
  the best part is that whoever wins ** has ** to trash abbott mercilessly to distance themselves from him . 
  turn back the vote boat !, 
  it 's done . 
  he 's not coming back from this . 
  whoever wins needs to frantically distance themselves from abbott . 
  that means we get a few weeks of his own party taking a giant dump on his rotting corpse . 
  a fitting end . 
  come to the green side . 
  they obviously wo n't win and i do n't agree with everything but they 're right about a lot more shit than either major party .

  i literally was making a joke . 
  there was already one spill 7 months ago and this has been headlines for the last few days . 
  do n't take nate silver to predict this . 
   the betrayal of you as leader of your party was one of the most shocking events i have ever witnessed . 
  i think it would be one of the most shocking events any of us have ever witnessed in politics -- the scale of it . 
  the idea that the man who had won , in this presidential campaign , an election against john howard was then going to be disposed of , discarded like another course on a lazy susan in a vietnamese restaurant -- the cruelty of it was extraordinary !,

  the tl ; dr is that they kept giving him more time to turn it around but it 's getting worse . 
  because of that history of shitting on the last government for doing this , they wanted to avoid a spill at all costs .

   the national center for policy analysis is a non-profit american think tank whose goals are to develop and promote private alternatives to government regulation and control, 
  their article does n't even cite the abs statistics , it just cites freerepublic.com which is just some guy 's blog . 
  in that guy 's blog post :, 
   references, 
   violent crime rates compiled from australian bureau of statistics and u.s. federal bureau of investigation sources . 
  email request for excel workbook . 
  so a think tank with an agenda citing some guy who calls himself `` mark twain '' on a blog with no references and his own methodology in an excel spreadsheet he can supply on request ... super duper scientific basically .

  aaaaaaaaahahahahhahahahahahaha,

  right . 
  in the scenario where the government is planning to `` take your guns '' , what do you think is going to happen ? 
  it 's unscientific to accept claims made without evidence as true . 
  it 's also unscientific to ignore clear bias .

  if you start talking about how much you love it i 'll give you a polite `` i 'm not into that sort of thing . '', 
  if you keep pushing it though , you 're going to hear no shortage of opinion . 
  well , you 'll get opinions from me on what those facts mean . 
  chomps into a raw onion and flies away, 
   my boyfriend said this , i 'm just not sure that they 'll take me seriously , especially seeing as i replied to him . 
  you told him to stop several times . 
  responding does n't give him the right to do that .

  they did that a few weeks ago . 
  what betrayal ? 
  obviously they just did n't sell their policies properly . 
  uncle malcolm will come in and explain why it 's all okay .

  i love a good joke but making the life of strangers worse for your own enjoyment makes you an asshole .

  [ found a clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiaxr4z1jvy ), 
   claiming they work because violence has reduced would be like banning everyone from driving on thursdays and then cheering about the reduction in road deaths . 
  if the predominance of road deaths on thursdays were caused by people driving all through wednesday then it would be worth considering . 
  are you really going to claim that people do n't get more drink as the night goes on ? 
  do you think the average bac is the same at 10pm as it is at 3am without lockout laws ?
