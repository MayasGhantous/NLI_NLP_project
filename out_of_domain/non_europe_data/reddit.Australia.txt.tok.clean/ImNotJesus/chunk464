  you ignored the second half of my comment . 
   are you really going to claim that people do n't get more drink as the night goes on ? 
  do you think the average bac is the same at 10pm as it is at 3am without lockout laws ? 
  the problem is n't that we need seatbelts , it 's that people crash cars . 
  [ it 's working ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-16/crime-statistics-and-lockout-laws-nsw-2015/6396486 ) . 
  yes there are still fights but there are proportionally far fewer , even when you consider fewer hours for people to fight in . 
  not as good as sjws to skeletons . 
  it 's a 10/10, 
  obviously it 's good if everyone has some basic knowledge of most sciences . 
  after a certain point though , knowledge of physics and maths in particular is functionally useless and just esoteric knowledge . 
  why would you care if random people on the street understand it ? 
  obviously you 're ashamed of your sexuality because why else would someone not want to sleep with him ? 
  [ study link ] ( http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/14/jac.dkv275.short?rss=1 ), 
  you mean his mmm , generously endowed penis ? 
  you do n't loudly say `` mmm '' when you think about the attributes of your own genitals ? 
  okay , weirdo . 
  if it helps you to laugh at it then that 's great . 
  this is where trump goes from adorable old coot to dangerous asshole . 
  carson is also a creationist . 
  irrespective of his skill as a neurosurgeon , his knowledge of science is clearly suspect . 
  i groan like keith jarrett, 
  carson is also a creationist . 
  irrespective of his skill as a neurosurgeon , his knowledge of science is clearly suspect . 
  [ he 's basically this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaur5bkilq ), 
  it sounds like she 's not a very good match for you . 
   there is a body of people who believe in evolution within the creation . 
  i mean this in the nicest way possible but they 're wrong . 
  you are more than welcome to your faith and i do n't begrudge anyone believing anything they want to believe , you just ca n't claim it 's compatible with science . 
   faith is one thing , science is another . 
  the two can co-exist for many people . 
  again , faith is totally fine but by definition it 's in contrast with science . 
  faith literally means believing something without evidence . 
  science is about using best evidence to form estimates of the world . 
  you can certainly have faith in some areas and follow best practice in science in others but they 're certainly not compatible on the same issue . 
  perhaps you 're in love with an image of her that is n't real . 
  you already accept that you 're a bad match for her , are you sure that your `` love '' for her is actually ** for her ** and not what you wish she was ? 
  sure , but that does n't mean that they were right about that one issue . 
  also , no one on that list has been alive in the last 60 years . 
  it 's really sad to hear you think that you 're unlovable because of one person 's opinion . 
   one must be alive to qualify to be a scientist or a religious person ? 
   some of these scientists have become among the most famous and honored of all the people in the scientific community . 
  absolutely . 
  but we also have access to a lot more information now . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable to believe that most if not all of those scientists would n't believe in creationism if they lived today . 
  for evidence , simply look at the fact that with each level of higher education in science ( high school -  bachelors -  postgrad -  academic positions ) there 's a reduction in the proportion of religious people . 
  again , that 's not to say that there 's anything inherently wrong with believing . 
  also , very importantly , every single scientist in the world is wrong about a lot of things . 
  just , on average , they 're right about more questions of science than other people . 
  that being said , believing something like creationism despite the extreme wealth of knowledge on the topic is being willfully ignorant at this stage for a scientist . 
  it brings into question their overall judgment and scientific knowledge in the same way it would if they were a flat earther . 
   did you know that many very important scientific discoveries are the result of heuristic experimentation ? 
  i know what heuristics are in the psychology sense of the word but i 've never heard of heuristic experimentation . 
  that guy must have pulled a few muscles with how far he was stretching . 
  seems like a pretty accurate depiction of his relative batting and bowling skill levels . 
  note : for those that do n't know , he 's one of the all time great australian cricket players . 
  he was on an episode of criminal minds playing a really dark character - he was amazing . 
  you ca n't blame him for shitty writing . 
  hello k508 . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  you accidentally posted this to / r/funny, 
  why ca n't you just let the votes decide ? 
  socrates died for this shit and we 're taking it too lightly . 
  you 're thinking of the study as testing a causal model instead of just a correlation . 
  with a positive correlation , people who score high on a , also tend to score high b. 
  with a negative correlation , people who score high on a , also tend to score low on b. 
  it 's very possible that a is n't causing b and b is n't causing a and that both are being influenced by another factor ( this is called the third variable problem ) . 
  so , there 's nothing in this study to say that watching fox news makes you dumber , it 's either saying that ( a ) the type of people who watch fox news are already ignorant and not being made less ignorant or ( b ) there 's a common factor causing ignorance and causing people to watch fox news ( probably education or something similar ) . 
  i hate how there has to be a * reaction * to everything now . 
  it 's not just that everyone has to have an initial opinion , we then need to have days of `` look how edgy and contrarian i am '' afterwards . 
  jesus , he 's a kid . 
  i did n't make shit when i was a kid . 
  he did n't ask for all of this fame so why are you tearing him down like he 's some attention whore ? 
  is it that upsetting to you that a kid gets some positive attention ? 
  they changed it briefly about 2 months ago and then changed it back . 
  nothing has changed , it 's purely placebo at this stage . 
  no one said it was n't . 
  your claim that it 's ** deliberately ** racist is wholly different . 
  which is different to the one in the picture . 
  you muddied the water with claims of ** deliberate ** ignorance . 
  besides me not understanding how someone * could * be deliberately ignorant , it seems very unlikely that they would do this deliberately . 
  abc radio is government owned and quite progressive . 
  are you even reading what you write before you hit save ? 
  i never said that . 
  i said that your characterisation of it as ** deliberately ** ignorant is absurd . 
  you live in a very interesting world in your head . 
  genuine question , how does someone become deliberately ignorant ? 
  he 's just being deliberately ignorant of how logic works . 
  i do n't think that 's fair . 
  i 'm sure that once the abc becomes/became aware of this they 'd take it down and for good reason . 
  it 's absurd to assume it was `` deliberately ignorant '' ( whatever that means ) but there 's also no harm in being sensitive to issues outside of your immediate culture . 
  fair point . 
  wait ... this is the internet . 
  you 're wrong and i fucked your mother . 
  in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  not because of any phony feminist 's blessing . 
  but because , i am enlightened by my intelligence .
