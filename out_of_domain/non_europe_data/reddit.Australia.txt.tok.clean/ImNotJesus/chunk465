  of my three subreddits , two are virtually the same colour . 
  is there anything i can do to change one ? 
  as an aside , god i 'm glad we changed the title rules in askreddit . 
  / r/iama and / r/science . 
  one is an orangey yellow , the other is a yellowy orange . 
  it 's not a big deal so do n't go to any major effort on my behalf . 
  thanks !, 
  he left a part out . 
   excuse me gorgeous * tips fedora *, 
  you should try not doing that . 
  you may be unintentionally being creepy . 
  if you ca n't remember their name , just do n't use one . 
  man , i 'd do business with someone named master shredder just for the tmnt nostalgia . 
  really emphasise the fe part . 
  [ link to journal article ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0191886915004900 ), 
  what do you base that conclusion on ? 
  edit : the guy i was responding to said that based on personal experience , spanking was only damaging when done by bad parents . 
  i 'd already written out my reply so here it is . 
   i understand that you had a certain experience but it 's important to remember that the aim of science is to look at situations as objectively as possible . 
  you , as does everyone else , have a very biased perception of your own childhood and there were so many factors that culminated in you being who you are today that it would be impossible to detect which caused what . 
  it 's also * entirely * possible that you are the exception to any rule , we only talk about probabilities in science . 
   all that being said , we know that , on average , spanking children ( a ) does n't work and ( b ) is related to a whole range of negative outcomes . 
  now i 'm certainly not an expert on corporal punishment and there may be research to suggest that there are `` good '' types of it but from what i 've read the general consensus is that the nature of using violence as a behaviour modification tool is simply not good . 
  i 'm sure you 're right that there are more or less damaging forms of it but individual anecdotes do n't mean a lot in science . 
  if the government reliably spent enough money to fund drug research and then have it sold at cost , it could work . 
  the problem is that no government is going to ( a ) legislate a bunch of giant corporations that have current legal rights out of business and ( b ) stand on a platform of spending billions of dollars in the hope that in a few decades ( average time from idea to sale is about 22 years ) will pay for itself . 
  this system is n't good but i do n't know that there 's a better one . 
  [ a hilarious podcast about it ] ( https://soundcloud.com/the-dollop/111-the-emu-war-live ), 
  it 's a podcast called the dollop . 
  they do american history normally but it 's a live tour in australia so it 's australian history . 
  you severely underestimate my tag skills . 
  thank god the age of entitlement is over . 
  i 'm so sick of these entitled teenagers expecting a living wage and support when they ca n't afford to feed themselves . 
  they should be contributing , like these giant corporations who get * absolutely * no benefits from government spending . 
  i ca n't imagine how roads and police help them in any way at all . 
  it 's not like the education and healthcare systems do anything to make sure they have capable workers . 
  they truly just give and give and expect nothing in return . 
  most of all , thank you for trickle down economics because when gina deigns to urinate above me i can finally feel the trickles of her generosity . 
  [ link to abstract ] ( http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/13/scan.nsv106.abstract ), 
  same icon for both . 
  interesting questions and answers are both good contributions so we do n't want them to be separate . 
  the icon will change as the numbers go higher . 
  that 's future president miss south carolina to you . 
  what sort of data would you want ?

  but where will i buy an $ 18 bottle of coke ? 
  dumb bitch . 
  that was the 8th nice thing i 'd done for her and the last stamp on my `` now i get sex card '' . 
  she was obviously just using me . 
  correct . 
  one thing i always teach my undergrads is that you should n't think of our brains as calculators , they 're estimation machines . 
  we work based on useful ` rules of thumb ' that are mostly right . 
  the problem is that these rules of thumb were developed in a very different environment to the one we live in now and they were built for speed , not accuracy . 
  the rule of thumb `` more calories = better '' , is n't a good strategy when you can walk to shops . 
  in the same way , the strategy of assuming that you and your community are right about things is a fantastic rule of thumb when you 're on the plains of africa . 
  if , however , you live in a world where mass communication means that it 's really easy to seek out confirmatory evidence and find an ingroup that agrees with you , it leads to being wrong about things . 
  every single person in the world is biased about countless things and in a range of different ways . 
  the problem is n't that people are biased , it 's that people are n't aware that they 're biased and how ( [ some fun reading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases ) ) . 
  edit : to clear up a little bit of confusion . 
  my point is n't to say that being aware of the fact that you are biased magically cures you from it . 
  my point is two-fold :, 
  1 ) people who watch fox news are n't inherently stupid or broken people . 
  they 're biased people who used a biased source of information to confirm what they already believe . 
  all humans do that to some extent . 
  there are thousands of ways in which you are biased in your every day life in small , discrete ways and it 's almost always self-serving ( interestingly , unless you 're suffering from depression - depressed people show less self-serving biases ) . 
  2 ) being aware of your bias is good . 
  it 's the entire point of the scientific method . 
  certainly , no scientist is perfectly impartial or never biases their work but an awareness of the ways in which you are biased and developing strategies to compensate is the only way to change it . 
  the point is n't to not be biased , the point is to accept that you 're biased and actively work to prove yourself wrong . 
  it seems possible . 
  we 're talking about it . 
  of course it would , that 's the whole point of the scientific method . 
  certainly , no scientist is perfectly impartial or never biases their work but an awareness of the ways in which you are biased and developing strategies to compensate is the only way to change it .

  so if we wanted data for an ama that happened before july 2015 , you could get the accurate numbers now ? 
  also , thanks for looking into it . 
  i know you 've been on this for weeks . 
  gon na need some holy water for that burn . 
  a jew in new york ? 
  not even he could get them a ring at this stage . 
  taking my comment as a kind of endorsement of your racist beliefs is a really bizarre interpretation . 
  the whole point is that rules of thumb * are n't * always good . 
  things like an ingroup bias are fantastically important in small hunting tribes , they do n't work well in large multicultural societies . 
  let 's call it an educated guess . 
  fantastic read . 
  if you like that , you may enjoy the drunkard 's walk - same concept but about how bad people are at estimating probabilities . 
  i really do n't understand what you mean at all . 
  sin is a moralisation of an action . 
  bias is a demonstrable reality of the world . 
  you have no moral obligation because of science to try to correct for your biases , it 's just the way the world is . 
  sure bud .
