  so , remember that the vast majority of our evolutionary history , food has been hard to come by . 
  if you can eat some rich , calorie dense food , that 's fantastic because those calories will last you longer . 
  that 's why rich food tastes so good to us . 
  however , because we can mostly access as much food as we want , it 's no longer a good strategy . 
  does that make sense ? 
  because scientists do n't know everything . 
  we also mostly know enough to know that we do n't know everything . 
  i think you entirely missed my point . 
  i was n't talking about current african people , i 'm talking about the fact that most of the time we have been evolving as a species was on the plains of africa as hunter gatherers . 
  i love lakoff 's work conceptually . 
  i have n't seen any good empirical replications though . 
  they predicted him waving on an escalator * and * doing a speech in front of american flags . 
  how did they know he 's be the first presidential candidate to do either of those things ? 
  also , context matters . 
  having a beer at a bar with an old work friend is different to `` come over to my house and get drunk with me '' . 
  wild ride .

  basically everything on this list works for that exact reason : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases, 
  we do n't allow people to flair things [ serious ] after the fact - it needs to be in the title . 
  the reason being that we ca n't see flair in the modqueue so it makes it impossible to moderate properly . 
  please review the [ submission rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules ) . 
  providing mental health support to children in schools is a fantastic goal , it should just go to hiring actual experts . 
  not abbott 's policy . 
  you mean communist and confederate ? 
  there 's a long way to go but it is amazing how much the discussion around mental illness has changed in the last decade . 
   it makes me wonder what would happen if all re programs suddenly taught islam, 
  you mean terrorism studies ? 
  karen would love it . 
  he adjusted it but he did n't start the program . 
   care to explain ? 
  well , a dumb person said a dumb thing . 
  there 's your explanation . 
  it hurt the community so much that you did n't even notice ?

   poverty is the cause of domestic violence , the desperate chaos of the underclass , played out in welfare dependency , mental illness , alcohol and drug abuse , especially psychosis-inducing ice . 
  yeah , no one with money has ever abused their spouse . 
  also , as a man , i 'm fucking insulted that she thinks that calling out spousal abuse is demeaning to men . 
  it 's 10x more demeaning to say that we ca n't call out the assholes in the bunch in case we hurt their feelings . 
  of course this issue can be helped with better access to mental health care , drug and alcohol rehab etc. 
  it should be a key part of any strategy . 
  but to deny that there are also cultural elements to the issue is ludicrous .

  until recently i would 've said [ birdemic ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/ ) is tough to beat but i have a new favourite . 
  [ maximum overdrive ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091499/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) is a symphony of bad but in all the most fun ways . 
  if you enjoy bad movies though , you should check out the podcast how did this get made, 
   and other people that tend to care about things that matter a little more than a whore hooking up with someone she 's already hooked up with once . 
  there it is . 
  it automatically flaired because of the source . 
  mods fixed it . 
   there 's no way that 's real . 
  ftfy, 
  turns out that it 's a [ real story ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/unruly-passenger-taped-seat-icelandair-flight-f1b7833828 ) . 
  it just had nothing to do with cursing . 
  [ actual story ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/unruly-passenger-taped-seat-icelandair-flight-f1b7833828 ), 
   the passenger `` drank all of his duty free liquor on the flight from iceland to jfk yesterday , '' ellwood wrote in his blog post . 
  trying to choke the woman next to him and screaming the plane was going to crash ) , fellow passengers subdued him and tie ( d ) him up for the rest of the flight . 
  he was escorted off the flight by police when it landed . '', 
  this shit is going to be in our history books and ** really ** hard to explain to our grandchildren . 
  this is just a classic case of [ dehumanisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dehumanization ) . 
  if you 're interested , [ here is a link to ] ( http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/haslam,%20dehumanization.pdf ) a really important review paper on the topic , which was coincidentally written by an australian . 
  this is fantastic . 
  we want as few barriers as possible in between people wanting and getting appropriate healthcare . 
  no heroes in this story . 
  everyone sucks . 
  i ca n't imagine any possible way that that would escalate issues . 
  that 's a better link , i 'll change mine . 
  you do n't ** need ** a psychiatrist . 
  based on what you have said , you are not suffering from any mental illness . 
  while not necessarily common , it does n't mean you 're unwell just because you 're attracted to your sister . 
  in fact , given the situation , i would n't say it 's surprising in the least . 
  that being said , if these feelings are making your life difficult , you certainly could talk to a psychologist about it . 
  there 's nothing to `` cure '' but discussing a difficult issue with a professional can certainly help you ( a ) understand your feelings on the topic and ( b ) normalise those feelings . 
  if you ** do ** want to see a psychologist , it would be pretty easy to tell your sister that you 're just getting a bit down about your disability and think it would be good to talk to someone professional about it . 
  depending on which country you 're in there may be some cheap/free options too if money is a concern .
