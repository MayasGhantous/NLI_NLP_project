  if you 're going to say something dumb and offensive at least ** try ** to make it funny . 
  it 's competing almost exclusively with long news articles about politics . 
  easy content always wins . 
  this one is especially dangerous because scare campaigns have stopped gm food from saving countless lives overseas . 
  it 's one thing if your average whole foods idiot does n't want to eat it but large-scale campaigns to have 3rd world countries ban gm crops has killed a lot of people . 
  the easiest way to dispel this myth is to simply explain that a very small portion of our brain is devoted to cognition . 
  the idea of more brain activity = better is insane because that would mean things like random muscle twitches , sensations that link to nothing , autonomic body responses etc. 
  jet fuel must have melted your brain . 
  fat is extremely calorie-dense . 
  it 's arguably the most `` green '' energy we have right now . 
  do n't you just want to stick your fingers into the pie ? 
  certainly not my area but from what i 've read , the literature is fairly mixed on how well we can be using renewable right now . 
  in the long term , it 's certainly better to be on 100 % renewable but most renewables are fairly inefficient at this stage . 
  yes because there are costs to making whatever it is . 
  it takes a huge amount of energy to produce a solar panel . 
  i never said anything about coal . 
  coal is obviously terrible . 
  you mean after the last bit ? 
  racist people ? 
  joking aside , it would actually be fascinating . 
  why would you tell someone you love them for the first time over text ? 
  received 12:56 pm, 
  development takes a long time and from the sounds of it , reddit was written with some god-awful code . 
  / u/deimorz has been excellent at communicating about how big the scope of some of the bigger changes are and what sort of timelines we are talking about . 
  no point expecting things that are n't reasonable . 
  he still gets karma that sneaky snake . 
  probably . 
   it 's pretty unsettling to have things clearly happening in the background , but no clue about what 's going on . 
  check out / r/modsupport . 
  that 's where we get most of our info and it 's open to everyone . 
  [ boo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3mxawa/announcement_the_timer/cviy953?context=3 ), 
  well it 's communication over the course of a few months . 
  i got excited :(, 
  they seem to be trying and actually have people on mod tools now . 
  i 'm not a dev so i do n't know how good they are but we generally feel like they 're working with us finally ( at least the modsupport/community teams ) . 
  the whole community and mod support teams have been really good and collaborative . 
  i hope that in the future we get the same level of respect from all admin departments . 
  mods wanted the admins to give a shit about the tools we have , they seem to be giving a shit . 
  this is obviously the first stage of a plan to manufacture `` authentic '' celebrity experiences on reddit and i 'm really worried what 's next . 
  alexis has hinted at account verifications for celebrities and i would be * really * disappointed if that included things that highlight the user in comment trees . 
  there 's also the concern of how we know it 's the celebrity and not just a pr team once they 're `` verified '' . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  the ads team were just really on the ball and noticed tom hanks making comments only seconds after it happened and quickly whipped up ads . 
  our policy on askreddit is that each person 's questions and comments should be voted on based on their own merit . 
  that 's why we do n't give anyone flair and why we made several rule changes to reduce baiting/stories in posts . 
  just leave ... 
  why waste your time complaining about something you do n't like ? 
  just do n't use it . 
  we want to be positive and talk about the things they 're doing well while still being honest on where they can improve . 
   said the moderator of / r/circlebroke . 
  you 're the second person to say that to me in the last week despite not being a mod there for ~ 18 months . 
  do i have a fan ? 
  that 's so cute . 
  we agree . 
  that 's why we thought people deserve to know . 
  important to point out that it 's not all admins - just one or two . 
  fyi - that screenshot is from the [ askreddit modpost ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3mxawa/announcement_the_timer ) . 
  there 's more discussion on the issue there .

  important to point out that there are lots of fantastic admins doing great work . 
  this seems to be the product of a couple of specific admins . 
  as a mod i can choose when to make my name green or not . 
  a bunch of people got angry at him for removing the ama of bad luck brian ( which turned out to be fake anyway ) for not fitting within the rules of the sub . 
  generally speaking , it depends on whether i 'm talking as myself or on behalf of the mod team . 
  as a one off , this is a distasteful attempt . 
  if it becomes a regular thing or is expanded , that 's a different story . 
  the `` this ... is ... reddit '' comment was super cringey . 
  we just did ... 
  as a mod we 've never been given the impression that that is on the table and i highly doubt it would happen right now . 
  we , as a team that includes karmanaut . 
  unidan was banned for using multiple accounts to downvote competing comments . 
  while it 's not a huge difference , there is a difference between manipulating views and manipulating votes . 
  also , it broke the rules . 
  do you really want mods selectively enforcing the rules ? 
  with the rules as they currently are , mods are allowed to ban any users for any reason they like . 
  individual subreddits can apply flair . 
  my fellow americans . 
  as a young boy , i dreamed of being a baseball ; but tonight i say , we must move forward , not backward ; upward , not forward ; and always twirling , twirling , twirling towards freedom !, 
   `` are you kidding me ? 
  that is just tremendous accuracy , '' one commentator said . 
  that 's some high quality reporting right there . 
  two fantastic choices . 
  congrats to both of you . 
  is that your first public distinguish ? 
  [ nailed it ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-51045-rafi-nailed-it-gif-imgur-tumbl-rbhz.gif ), 
  yeah but then he went and ruined the front page algorithm which is literally bigger news than a gunman in a university . 
  [ i got the other one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/reporttheadmin/comments/3n5hjh/overview_for_better_dead_than_redtaboo/ ), 
  me or the filthy admin ? 
  this . 
  if you see two consistent contributors to reddit getting hired and all you can think is that , maybe you 're the problem . 
  there are n't many mods/users who do more than them . 
  get over your fake war , you just look like an idiot . 
  wait , a former meth addict gets clean , spends their spare time trying to be positive and helping people on a website they care about and manages to get a job out of it ? 
  what a horrible person .
