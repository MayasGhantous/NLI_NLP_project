  overall , it creates better content and that 's really obvious if you compare askreddit recently to 3/4 years ago . 
   you said the post was a fantastic example of why we , who 's we ? 
  ~ ~ the secret cabal i 'm in ~ ~ obviously the mod team . 
   why do n't you allow people to post what they like to your user content driven website ? 
  again , because overall it increases the quality of content . 
  why do n't we allow image submissions to askreddit too ? 
  i 'm sure they 'd be popular . 
   if you think censoring opinions that are critical of reddit is improving quality we have a fundamental differing of views . 
  you have a very interesting way of seeing the world . 
  the user would have been more than welcome to make a post about the front page sorting as long as it followed the rules . 
  our rules work on structure of title , not content . 
  you can ask about almost any subject as long as you do it in a way that does n't break the rules that are clearly laid out in the wiki . 
  hell , if you 're not sure , just message us and we will literally help you word the question . 
  i hope you win your imagined war . 
   lol - the same guy who got caught lying his ass off about the modtools and the askreddit shutdown , so he had to go back and delete all of his comments . 
  what ? 
  thank god i 'm from australia !, 
  i enjoy it overall . 
  i like helping the subs i manage grow and improving content . 
  you can generally choose whether or not to get involved in the meta drama . 
  honestly , i 've commented in most of the really shit subs on this website to explaining modding stuff from time to time and no one was more unreasonable that undelete . 
  seriously , i made the exact same comment in blackout and it was positive karma . 
  they 're really passionately fighting some imaginary war .

  posting pi - not even once . 
  absolutely . 
  i would also considering changing your username if you 're not particularly attached to it . 
  my last username referenced my real name . 
   three scientists who developed therapies against parasitic infections have won this year 's nobel prize in physiology or medicine . 
  first line of the article . 
  they won it specifically for that drug though . 
  we ca n't make you change your username but i can strongly recommend it . 
  nobel prizes are for a specific discovery . 
  it 's not like a scientist mvp award , it 's specifically the authors of a certain study/finding . 
  obviously not because then my username would be / u/notimjesus, 
  did ... did he mean liberace or something else ? 
  i genuinely do n't know . 
  some portmanteau of liberal and oligarchy ? 
  why people believe is still a really under-researched area but a possible explanation for this is that people are generally safer and more trusting of secular institutions to protect them . 
  putting aside all the individual gripes you have with the government , ** overall ** , this is the safest time to be alive in human history . 
  one major theory of how `` big gods '' came to be so prevalent is the supernatural punishment hypothesis . 
  the two sentence version is that believing in a god that would punish wrongdoers allowed us to grow societies past the point where you could know everyone around you . 
  this became necessary as agrarian society took hold and we could n't monitor everyone to see if they do the right thing . 
  there 's all sorts of evidence for this idea - ara norenzayan , the biggest researcher in this area , [ has a book on it ] ( http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10063.html ) . 
  note that it does n't mean that belief in god necessarily protects against negative behaviours , although some research does support that idea - [ link ] ( http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/manuscripts/shariff&amp;norenzayan2011.pdf ) . 
  so , now that we have police and courts etc. , we no longer * need * to believe in a god that will protect us from wrongdoers because secular institutions have supplanted it . 
  but , when there 's naturally occurring instability , [ belief in god goes up ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20954784 ) . 
  whether or not you trust the police personally , we live in the safest time in human history . 
  that 's just one piece of the literature but thought some of you may find it interesting . 
  it 's obviously a product of a wide range of factors including education , mass-communication and others . 
  edit 1 : please note that i am giving you some background on * one theory * about * one factor * that seems to relate to belief in moralizing gods appearing as societies grew above tribal size . 
  i mention this theory because it has , in built , some explanation of ** part of ** why religious belief seems to be declining in safer countries . 
  please do not read this as me explaining all of religious belief . 
  there are dozens of other theories of how and why religions developed .
