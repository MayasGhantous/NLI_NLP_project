  just because there 's a huge amount of money in attacking `` big pharma '' does n't mean that they 're horrible monsters who never do anything right . 
  yup . 
  great question . 
  the argument is that gods got more ` moralizing ' as societies got bigger . 
  there 's some cool research on this , do you have journal access ? 
  they 're certainly different . 
  the idea is that there 's a for of motivated reasoning where you desire believing in a god that will protect . 
  if there 's no need for protection , you do n't have that desire . 
  the work is mostly correlational at this stage ( looking at different types of gods found when there is water scarcity , for example ) but that 's the idea . 
  definitely !, 
  but they overlap at times . 
  there is some research looking into that as well . 
  you 'd be interested in terror management theory . 
  this is just one branch of research . 
  the phenomenon of religious belief is remarkably complex and there 's no way it will be attributable to one cause . 
  weirdly , researching the psychology of belief is a very new thing so we 're still in the infancy of it . 
  that 's certainly one theory . 
  look at freud and the terror management theory stuff . 
  the work does n't have great empirical backing but it 's theoretically interesting . 
  it 's not a theory that explains this specific piece of research . 
  it explains a slow drift away from religiosity . 
   this is assuming that humans would steal and kill without religion . 
  how do we know that humans are n't inherently moral, 
  it does n't do that at all . 
  it assumes that people worry about others stealing and killing . 
  it 's a fine distinction but people believed in gods to control * others * . 
  it says nothing about whether it affected behaviour or not . 
  that being said , one study but shariff & norenzayan found that people who believe in a more punishing god were less likely to cheat in an experimental condition . 
  i 'll edit the original . 
  if you read the paper , this trend begins before 9/11, 
  interesting idea , not that i can think of . 
  you might find this interesting as a starting point but nothing that looks at resentment - http://www.researchgate.net/publication/47457936_for_god_ ( or ) _ country_the_hydraulic_relation_between_government_instability_and_belief_in_religious_sources_of_control, 
  let me know if you want any other refs . 
  apa or bust, 
  yes but until the 20th century we lived in a ** far ** more dangerous world . 
   as americans become more individualistic , it makes sense that fewer would commit to religion . '', 
  it 's worth pointing out the twenge , the lead author , is best known for showing that narcissism in rising in the us . 
  if anyone can make a statement about individualism , it 's twenge . 
   then how could it have had a positive impact on societal growth ? 
  because the belief itself is meaningful . 
  someone should teach ndt about [ the flynn effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect ) . 
  hard to say but possibly .

  thank you !, 
  having a read now . 
   as an academic, 
  [ you should apply for flair !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair ), 
  for context - this fits with a long line of research that shows feeling disgust as an important factor in moral judgments . 
  for example , one haidt study had participants answer moral judgment questions next to a smelly garbage bin and their judgments of the same scenarios were harsher than those not near the bin . 
  the same effects have been found with trait disgust . 
  in short , your senses can affect the way you perceive the world . 
  what this study may tell us is that how someone relates to their sense of taste can alter their behaviours , which is fascinating . 
  will do !,

  she 's literally using a baby carrier as intended . 
  that 's a product , out of a box , with instructions that show you how to do exactly what she did . 
  i really , really tried to understand what he was trying to say . 
  was the entire point that words can describe themselves ? 
  he legitimately spends more time explaining how he is explaining his idea than actually explaining it . 
  what dash problems ? 
  rough day for frosty . 
  long way to go and the car is fast . 
  what does n't it fix ? 
  that 's what wives are for mate . 
  girls coming back out !, 
  svg is in 12th but he 's really quick . 
  fine by me . 
  it does n't affect my enjoyment in any way and they make more money . 
  ca n't believe frosty is still in this race after all the bad luck he 's had this weekend . 
  rain on his fast lap in qualifying , owen getting hit in the first lap , electronics issues leading to a 15 second penalty , badly timed safety car . 
  what an effort from the team to have him up the pointy end still . 
  my favourite part of the whole broadcast is the 2 second awkward staring the pit reporters do before they realise they 're on the air . 
  come on dumbrell , accept the inevitable . 
  it 's basically just the same music they play on the block . 
  come on frosty !,
