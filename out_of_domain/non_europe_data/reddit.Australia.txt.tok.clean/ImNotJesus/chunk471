  fuuuuuuuuck how did jamie miss the safety car . 
  that looked dodgy ... 
  definitely . 
  i just wish i could watch more supercheap auto ads . 
  arrogance will get you . 
  typical red bull . 
  frosty !!!!!!!, 
  i was hoping . 
  gracie or winterbottom ? 
  how you can boo anyone after 1,000 km is beyond me . 
  bunch of assholes .

  np does n't work . 
  neither does using ss unless you blank out names . 
  why do you even want a link ? 
  for one , the organic industry is a giant , giant industry built on anti-scientific premises . 
  organic farming has worse yields , less safe produce and ca n't beat traditional or gmo farming in blind taste tests . 
  the entire marketing behind organic is built on the premise that traditional/gmo farming is bad/dangerous .

  gmo papers get linked here all the time . 
  are you looking for information on safety ? 
  it 's also not a paid advertisement , it 's an editorial from leading scientists . 
   am not so much for or against gmo crops as i am that i want them tested . 
  i want to know how they go with native wildlife , how invasive of a species it can turn out . 
  an how the hell we will deal with it with places like monsanto nuke the replanting of crops . 
  it 's worth remembering that all farming messes with genes . 
  the * only * people * actually * testing what happens when you mess with those genes are gmo scientists . 
   gm crops are something different . 
  there have n't been sufficient studies done yet .

   no , im ok , im actually in the middle of eating this whole time, 
  what a badass . 
  she handled that whole thing really well . 
  there are actually studies to show this works . 
  if you give people two identical pieces of salmon and one is `` salmon '' while the other has several adjectives , people rate the one with more elaborate descriptions as more enjoyable .

  right . 
  you have to keep checking in with your partner to make sure they 're still comfortable . 
  that 's not unreasonable . 
  just because you 're touching , does n't mean sex is okay . 
  teaching kids to be careful of cues and that yes to something is very specific to the activity you 're doing is a good thing .

  congratulations , you got a reaction from users . 
  that 's what you wanted , right ? 
  well , i 've decided i do n't like people like you . 
  you 've messed with the community of the wrong conspiritards . 
  before you get excited , you have n't even made me angry . 
  i am a hard person to make angry . 
  however , i despise people like you . 
  your pitiful admin skills are hilarious . 
  banning accounts and changing source code are level 1 . 
  can you image-hash encrypted jlaw nudes ? 
  can you infiltrate ircs without leaving a mark ? 
  your silly little red-tag anonymity wo n't protect you . 
  i 've hacked into many admins ' computers and spied on the government shills . 
  i 've hacked into private subs . 
  i have been hacking since i had a computer . 
  it 's what i was raised to do . 
  you have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling . 
  all you are is just a community of internet autocrats . 
  have you ever murdered anyone ? 
  i have no empathy and i will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face . 
  you think i 'm giving you an empty threat ? 
  believe that . 
  i have contacts in dark places that you do n't want to know about . 
  if you live even close to me you better fear for your karma . 
  track my ip if you want to , but i am smart enough to use a library computer . 
  hack into my account if you want , but it 'll just make it easier for me to track you .
