  oh do you not want them to know about all those people you banned for me ? 
  as an aside , i really hate this kind of social media marketing . 
  make a pandering meme and cover it with branding ( this is particularly egregious ) and then rely on people ` sharing ' on facebook . 
  obviously , because women are devoid of agency easily manipulated . 
  if a woman is dating someone who does n't plan to marry her it must be because she has been tricked . 
  why would a woman ever want anything besides marriage ? 
  for them , dating is just a way to earn marriage .

   no , the kind of coment that gets removes is `` trannies are just men with mutilated dicks '' , which is over the line . 
   is it though ? 
  it may be offensive but it does n't advocate harm . 
  that `` line '' has been too vague and clearly varies between different mods , which is n't right . 
   mhm , which is why insults directed at other users have always been banned . 
  recently we 've crossed into removing general un-pc comments , and that ai n't right no matter how much i disagree with them . 
  do they think that saying horrible things only hurts people when they 're directed towards a specific user ? 
  if you do n't want to ban shitty behaviour that 's your choice but do n't pretend that it 's harmless . 
  from the full paper , this is what a conjunction fallacy is : `` a conjunction fallacy is a cognitive bias whereby two or more things co-occurring appear to be more probable than the occurrence of one of the constituents alone . '',

  important to point out that the authors said that the children likely had ** other ** development disorders but were being misdiagnosed as autistic . 
  this is n't a case of doctors over-diagnosing . 
  if you 're going to get on your high horse at least read like the first 4 paragraphs . 
  quote from the [ dsm-v diagnostic criteria ] ( https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/diagnosis/dsm-5-diagnostic-criteria ) :, 
   e . these disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability ( intellectual developmental disorder ) or global developmental delay . 
  intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur ; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability , social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level . 
  basically , a lot of the features of asd are found in children with developmental delays . 
  children with typical autism features are being diagnosed with asd . 
  did you read the article ? 
  i 'm also curious what criteria you are using to make that statement . 
  do you have a lot of experience diagnosing ad * h * d or is this just a personal opinion based on your impression of society ? 
  you may want ton consider how scientific the latter is . 
  there 's also a lot of overlap between different developmental disorders and no two presentations of any psychological disorder are the same . 
  especially if it 's not being diagnosed by a specialist , it 's very easy to see how a child could be diagnosed with a related disorder . 
  remember that psychological disorders are clusters of symptoms that exist on healthy continuums . 
  it 's normal to feel anxiety . 
  it 's pathology if you feel too much anxiety too often . 
  when you 're looking at a combination of half a dozen possible symptoms , differences in personalities , biases introduced by expectations of the parent and just that there 's still a lot we do n't know , it becomes very complicated . 
  and which research do you base that position off ? 
  i 'd love to read your work on the matter . 
  obviously this person has significant clinical research experience in childhood developmental disorders so we should hear them out . 
  why else would they make such bold and authoritative statements unless they were an expert on the topic ? 
  i did n't say you were wrong . 
  i asked what scientific basis you had to believe that professionals on the topic were wrong . 
   parents especially like those , since raising a supposedly autistic child also gives them bragging rights . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  if you can find one parent who was happy that their child has autism i 'll eat my own toenails . 
  no but taking anything in this article as evidence for an already-held belief that it 's due to developmentally typical children being diagnosed with disorders is just wrong . 
   overdiagnosing all these things to sell pills and treatment to people . 
  what do you mean , they 're getting those big pharma kickbacks to diagnose kids with autism / s, 
  that 's bullshit . 
  the / r/science mods are known for censoring anti-feminist agendas . 
  why ca n't you just let the votes decide ? 
  so are mods getting paid now ? 
  because i do n't see another reason why regular reddit users would want to contribute to making this site utter shit . 
  unless it 's the power trip you get from deleting posts , i understand that . 
  those are the only two reasons that i could see any mod deleting this . 
  they 're enforcing nonexistent rules and bending the existent ones so that they can delete whatever they want . 
  there 's absolutely no harm in asking that , unless there 's an agenda against providing alternatives because of money and investors . 
  and if you ask me , if the people who actually give a flying shit about reddit want to retain people and said investors , maybe they should ask themselves why they feel the need to delete posts instead of having faith in their product and allowing for dissenting discussion . 
  i think it 's horseshit they removed the post . 
  ** and i do n't think i 'm alone . 
  you people would make mccarthy red with embarassment . 
  if you censor freedom of speech , you 're basically like the nazis before they started killing . 
  the thing is that anti-sjw 's are , in many cases , highly educated . 
  highly educated , specifically in stem . 
  when you compare that kind of educational rigor to someone who has a gender studies degree , it 's not even a contest . 
  these people are literally looking for reasons to dumb down the culture and create a world that 's not based on personal responsibility and earning your own keep . 
  are you fucking high ?
