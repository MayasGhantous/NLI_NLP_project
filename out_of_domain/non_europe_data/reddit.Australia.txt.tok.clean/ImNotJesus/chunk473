  this whole site used to run on what people thought was popular . 
  that 's the entire point of this post . 
  hundreds of millions spent marketing the site that way for almost a decade . 
  these people are either insane , idiots , or purposefully driving the site into the ground . 
  i do n't need your advice . 
  i understand you think you 've got some useful view on this , but you 're just uninformed . 
  which is why your perspective is `` you went out of your way to find a thread were people do n't have a high opinion of you and then started antagonizing them . '', 
  the mere fact that that 's all you see from this tells me you do n't have an opinion worth listening to . 
  here 's their `` win '' to you . 
  i got downvoted , but they have no voice in the community , the rules they complain about move in the opposite direction of what they want , they 're removed from the community i actually care about . 
  which of their goals was accomplished ? 
  am i not a mod ? 
  nope . 
  did the rules change in their favor ? 
  nope . 
  will they be able to discuss the rules they complain about ? 
  nope . 
  can they post on the community i care about ? 
  nope . 
  but they did get to downvote me . 
  to you , that 's them winning . 
  seems to be for them too . 
  the part you are missing is , it is for me too . 
  i actually got the things i wanted except honest discussion . 
  while it sucks i ca n't get that from them , they 're paying the price , not me . 
  i still have all the power . 
  they give up what little they had . 
  if you want to call losing your influence and moving your goals backwards `` then they win '' go for it , but i 'm not buying it, 
  ^ if you guys write stuff like this just days before trying to prevaricate here , it 's no wonder that you 're losing . 
  the same gaslighting self-serving facile fallacies have been served to us before . 
  you gaslight just by saying it 's never been discussed when bk routinely goes insane about such things . 
  you have no authority as moderators to impose new rules . 
  your vision is completely inconsequential as the space belongs to the users whom you serve . 
  according to the way the site works you could proscribe articles in comments and ban anyone who uses ` a ' , ` an ' or ` the ' from a default subreddit . 
  that user could then be shadowbanned for using another account to post in said default . 
  it 's ridicuous , you all obviously get paid , and this is an illegal and immoral charade you guys are pushing . 
  you seem to have your rhetoric reversed , as what you present is what is undesirable . 
  one wonders how -- as a human being -- you have been educated , loved , made love , let alone sleep at night or swallow food without choking when you routinely type out equivocating dreck like that . 
  these lies are criminally illegal and you pr/idiots need to stop . 
  you do not seem to realize how little power you have as arbitrators of fact . 
  if people want an evolutionary psychology theory ( i know you do ! ), 
  it may very well be a survival technique . 
  you 're basically telling people , `` hey , you know our hierarchy and your position ? 
  yeah ... no , you do n't '' . 
  this is information usually acquired over two decades from toddling to the end of adolescence . 
  the energy expended is enormous and is most of what we consume in those years . 
  the suggestion of having to do it over again basically sounds impossibly hellish , even if the reality is that it does n't take a full lifetime to foster a new sense of one 's already processed experiences . 
  and as most people have already mentioned , it is incredibly emotionally painful to even entertain that large important parts of one 's life were even slightly not what they seem . 
  it takes a great deal of energy to mourn and persevere , and many people are struggling just to go to work and maintain a family . 
  i originally responded to kerovon as a joke and people kept upvoting me so i continued . 
  i then started copy-pasting things from the last time i was on undelete and now i 'm just using comments from dudeareyoufuckingser because they 're all hilariously insane . 
  breaking news : scientist is a scientist . 
  coming up after the break we 'll expose the bankers who actually work at banks . 
  just to be clear . 
  in your opinion , the science subreddit should be run entirely by people who are n't involved in science ? 
  literally every single scientist has a conflict of interest by your standard . 
  i get paid by a university . 
  is it a conflict of interest every time i moderate on a study run by a different university ? 
  that 's a conflict of interest because when they tell someone to speak to a lawyer they could be profiting from it !, 
   brigaded upvotes, 
  must be a brigade if people disagree with you . 
  no other possible reason . 
  if only . 
  is there a way i could organise that actually ? 
  if you know anyone looking for a shill i 'm pretty poor . 
  i would bet that less than 1 % of reviewers/editors of peer-reviewed publications are n't practising scientists and most of those are probably retired scientists . 
  you 're being paid by a rival company to attack him and make dow seem shady . 
  prove me wrong . 
  the burden of proof is on the corporate employee so * you * have to do it . 
  hi navegar , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it is a repost of an already submitted and popular story .

   this is a mod who 's paid by dow . 
  it is a conflict of interest . 
  every single moderator is a working scientist . 
  every single one is being paid by an institution who could potentially benefit from extra positive press in / r/science . 
  there you go . 
  every single one of us has a coi . 
  consider it declared . 
  hi elbartos29 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  you want the entire mod team to dox themselves so that you individually go and judge each of our individual actions ? 
  that sounds * really * tempting . 
  hi pablogelo , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3q7oxk/brain_implant_lets_rats_see_infrared_light/ ) . 
  neither of those findings are completely unexpected . 
  openness to experience is related to an appreciation for art and the abstract so it makes sense that they would be more exposed to and engage in more music . 
  as for extraversion , again that 's a predictable result . 
  extraverts experience more positive emotions and evaluate themselves more positively . 
   small effects , many dependent variables , no preregistration . 
  this is not a convincing paper . 
  none of those are necessarily damning . 
  preregistration is fairly new and still not done by the majority . 
  also , small effect sizes do n't mean that they 're meaningless . 
  why you should definitely pay attention to effect size , you would be surprised how small the effect sizes of most psychology/medical research is . 
  do they ? 
  do you have any examples of peer-reviewed research that was removed for reasons other than already established rules ?
