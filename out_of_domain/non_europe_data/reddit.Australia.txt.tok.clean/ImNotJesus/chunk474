  i agree that it 's definitely worth considering . 
  the combination of the two does risk a `` fishing expedition '' . 
  i was probably reacting more to the strength with which he made the statement . 
  all his points are completely valid , they just do n't invalidate the findings necessarily . 
  i 'm offended by his claim . 
   large dependent variable pools , correct me if i am wrong / u/imnotjesus , are almost impossible to escape in psychology and are considered when making conclusions . 
  it depends on the design . 
  some studies use the opportunity of having a present sample to test a range of predictions . 
  if done appropriately ( e.g. , not just ignoring non-sig results ) it 's generally considered okay . 
   small effects are different than significance . 
  absolutely . 
  both are important and both should be considered in context . 
  the unfortunate reality is that people are ** really ** complicated so effect sizes in psych and medicine are generally not huge ( r = .24 - .3 depending on the area ) . 
  because of those small seeming effect sizes , social and personality psychology in particular have received a lot of undue criticism . 
  there 's a fantastic paper that talks about it and compares to well-known findings in medicine that you would expect to be large correlations - [ link ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/56/2/128/ ) . 
  examples :, 
  aspirin and reduced risk of death by heart attack ( r = .02 ) . 
  general batting skill as a major league baseball player and hit success on a given instance at bat ( r = .06 ) . 
  calcium intake and bone mass in premenopausal women ( r = .08 ) . 
  antihistamine use and reduced runny nose and sneezing ( r = .11 ) . 
   the data could have come about just as easily if none of the conclusions drawn from it are true . 
  that 's where we disagree . 
  lots of things we expect to be true are n't when we test them . 
  it 's important to confirm things instead of just guessing . 
  are you not assuming there that they ran bivariate correlations on all possible combinations ? 
  i 'm certain they did n't do that in this case . 
  your point is valid and i agree that better understanding of familywise error rate is important , i just do n't think this was as much of a fishing expedition as you 're asserting .

  thanks for doing this ama . 
  i enjoyed the study and i really like the idea . 
  what struck me reading it though was that all of your studies look at values assigned to closed-mindedness and not direct measures of it . 
  why did you decide to measure appraisals of closed-mindedness instead of the behaviour itself ? 
  have you tried any studies where you manipulate perception of expertise and then directly test whether the participant uses more biased cognition as a result ? 
  it 's interesting in itself that the norm changes but i feel like showing an actual change in behaviour would be a more compelling case for the model . 
  for a long time the overwhelming majority of research was done on first year psych students , mostly because you could build into their first year programs that they must participate in research as a `` learning exercise '' . 
  mturk has broadened the samples but they 're still mostly weird ( western , educated , industrialised , rich and democratic ) . 
  mturk samples are surprisingly diverse . 
  while definitely not representative , you are absolutely right that it provides a huge amount more power to studies ( in general ) which does lessen the effect of biased sampling . 
  that being said , the samples in this study were actually quite small . 
  could you do something like this :, 
  ask participant for their position on a difficult topic ( e.g. , death penalty ), 
  apply the manipulation, 
  give them a `` scientific article '' from x expert that disagrees with their position . 
  have them rate how well written/convincing etc. 
  that article is . 
  presumably , closed-minded people would be less convinced by an article that runs counter to their already held beliefs . 
  you may find this interesting : https://mturk4academics.wordpress.com/tag/attention-check/, 
  some useful advice . 
  things like telling them in advance that there will be an attention check which makes a lot of sense . 
  ooo i like that . 
  i might try it out . 
  in short , this shows that most of the benefit that 's normally attributed in the literature to being religious may be more a function of being a member of the dominant ingroup . 
  similarly , there was a paper a couple of years ago that showed the same effect with reported levels of happiness . 
  it was long believed that religiosity was related to higher levels of subjective well-being but this effect only seems to be true in areas where the believer is part of the dominant ingroup . 
   for six days in november 2014 , while the participants performed their normal work , the researchers exposed them to various simulated building conditions : conventional conditions with relatively high concentrations of volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) , such as those emitted from common materials in offices ; green conditions with low voc concentrations ; green conditions with enhanced ventilation ( dubbed `` green + '' ) ; and conditions with artificially elevated levels of co2 , independent of ventilation . 
  at the end of each day , they conducted cognitive testing on the participants . 
  they manipulated environment and found that cognitive ability varied . 
  that * suggests * that the direction goes environment -  cognitive ability .
