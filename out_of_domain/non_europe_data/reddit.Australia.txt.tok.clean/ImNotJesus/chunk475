  hey / u/jumpybumpy229 . 
  i 'm sorry that you 're feeling really unsafe right now . 
  if you think you 're in immediate danger , the best people to call are always 911 . 
  if it 's a long-term issue , my recommendation would be talking to a safe friend/family member that might let you stay with them and/or cps . 
  i would also ** strongly ** recommend having a chat to someone like [ teenline ] ( https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/ ) who are a crisis support centre for teens . 
  they would have the most appropriate advice for you and could probably help you feel a bit more okay in the moment . 
  hope that helps . 
  best of luck . 
  his assistant did a great job . 
  oh i meant that completely sincerely . 
  to be fair , the invasion was actually going okay . 
  the problem was n't the invasion itself , the problem was that the rebuilding of iraq was one of the greatest foreign policy fuck ups in american history . 
  sadaam was a monster and to some extent , the americans * were * seen as liberators . 
  the problem was actually when they started doing things like de baathification and destroying the economy through raegonomics . 
  dude . 
  at least google it first :, 
   aly is a staff member of the global terrorism research centre at monash university, 
  waleed is a god damn national treasure . 
  i disagree with him on a lot of political issues ( he 's actually very conservative , in the traditional sense of the word ) but he 's a brilliant guy . 
  you could ... you know ... see which one she uses . 
  i find it funny how much overlap there is between the `` nsa are the worst '' and `` it 's great that wikileaks posts everything '' venn diagrams overlap . 
  they talk about basketball !, 
  yeah , i ca n't wait to cash out my 401karma, 
  but like would n't it be crazy if he did ? 
  imagined can mean `` not real '' but in this context it probably means assumed . 
  [ experiments 1a and 1b show that whites exposed to evidence of racial privilege claim to have suffered more personal life hardships than those not exposed to evidence of privilege . 
  ] ( https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/hard-knock-life-whites-claim-hardships-response-racial-inequity ), 
  from a psychological perspective , it 's not surprising at all . 
  of course no one wants to think that their life is easier than other people 's . 
  but , it 's important to remember that , objectively speaking , not everyone has the same opportunities . 
  did you know that ceo 's are disproportionately tall ? 
  it 's true . 
  when going for a ceo position , you have a better chance of getting the job if you 're taller . 
  it 's not deliberate . 
  it 's not that there are boards sitting around the table agreeing that they should hire someone taller . 
  on some level , we just have an unconscious bias that makes us more likely to see tall people as appropriate for leadership roles . 
  that does n't mean that tall people do n't deserve to be ceos , it just means that it 's just a bit easier for them . 
  as is posted in / r/todayilearned constantly , blind orchestra auditions led to a * massive * influx of female players . 
  a basic understanding of social and/or cognitive psychology could tell you this . 
  understanding that life is easier for some people than others does n't make your achievements less valid . 
  you still had to get out of bed every morning to actually get that job , it 's just about being aware that for some others it 's a bit harder . 
  you can be compassionate and understanding without losing anything . 
  it 's not zero-sum . 
  / u/firedrops explained it much better than me [ further down this chain ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3to4e9/43_of_americans_feel_that_discrimination_vs/cx7we2p?context=3 ), 
  [ a nice analogy that explains `` white privilege '' in less inflammatory terms and makes a lot of sense . 
  ] ( http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/ ), 
  exactly . 
  racism was cured years ago . 
  we should just stop talking about it . 
  edit : / s, 
  you 're arguing against an extreme version of the argument though . 
  sure , there might be some assholes out there who say that no white male can achieve anything meaningful . 
  so what ? 
  they 're as representative as the kkk are of white people . 
  accepting that , on average , certain groups have an advantage does n't in any way invalidate the achievements of that group . 
  as i said , you still have to be there and get shit done . 
  no one is invalidating all white people . 
  i strongly suggest you read the second link i shared , it explains it better than i could . 
  yes . 
  i can see how that would be unclear with some of the terrible comments in this post . 
  it 's not equality ... it 's equity . 
  do you think it is accurate to say that if we averaged all white people and all black people in america that ** on average ** being black made it harder to achieve the same level of success ? 
  so you think that , on average , black people lose the exact same amount of opportunities to implicit and explicit racism as white people do ? 
   whites have it easier than blacks in some regards, 
  you believe in white privilege . 
  you do n't need to believe life is easy for all white people and hard for all black people . 
  it 's just a matter of accepting that * on average * it 's harder for black people which is empirically true . 
  cancer is worse than whooping cough therefore whooping cough is n't a real issue . 
  i agree . 
  but it 's not zero sum . 
  we can talk about both . 
  just because ses and education are bigger issues , it does n't make race go away , especially given that they 're all tied together . 
  try reading the analogy in my second link . 
  it certainly wo n't fix all cases and it may not target the causes * but * , if it means that fewer children die from preventable illnesses it 's worthwhile . 
  while a lot of the upper middle class ` conscience objections ' may remain , it will still increase vaccinations in cases of ( a ) laziness and ( b ) objections that are only small . 
  it 's irreparable ** and ** forever . 
  we 're fucked . 
   subsidise the lifestyles, 
  those lavish baby-havers . 
  oh i was n't aware that he was playing 1 on 1 . 
  while you win points for blaming the libs , you lost them instantly for linking to the herald sun, 
  who weekly, 
  [ abstract link ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/18/1511536112 ), 
  it was asked late and there were already a tonne of questions . 
  he almost certainly never saw it . 
  it 's possible . 
  a recent study was looking at economic scarcity and found the same effects when looking at time scarcity - [ link ] ( http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/02/12/0956797614563958.abstract ), 
  it 's an imperfect tool but probably far more representative than first year psych students who were the vast majority of participants before mturk was around . 
  i think it 's a huge gain for the field , not just in ability to have ( somewhat ) more representative samples but the time it saves is massive . 
  well , they 're certainly a biased sample but they 're just a less biased sample than other options . 
  getting a completely representative sample is extremely expensive and time consuming and therefore prohibitive for a lot of research . 
  but the answer is that we accept it as one of the biases innate in the work . 
  cross-cultural and representative work is highly touted because of this . 
  here 's some more info if you 're interested - [ link ] ( http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/weirdpeople.pdf ) . 
  any time . 
  some people want the divination card to ( a ) be very common and ( b ) tell a certain story . 
  maybe you would use yours on a high end item but they 're allowed to enjoy the card however they like . 
  this is actually how he already coaches .
