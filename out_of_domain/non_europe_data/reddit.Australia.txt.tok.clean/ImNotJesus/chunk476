  he was reading a 2004 slam magazine and it had a profile on kobe that said he was good at scoring . 
  he definitely made and manages the website himself . 
  i 've heard he 's great at html . 
  when your friend mashes the keys in 2k but it somehow goes in . 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/25/us/us-muslim-extremists-terrorist-attacks.html?_r=1 ) . 
  not a single terrorist in america since and including 9/11 was a refugee . 
  if you were travelling to another country to engage in terrorism it would really be one of the dumbest ways to go about it . 
   were n't so willing to undercut the proper employment conditions then there would be no problem finding australian workers . 
  he literally got fired for not doing that . 
  how desperate are you to prove your own ideology that you end up sounding like such a moron ? 
  jesus man , take a breath . 
  that 's not what you said at all . 
  but still , the point is that by naming his employer on his facebook he 's representing his company . 
  if i wear my work uniform out and act like an ass , i deserve to have the repercussions follow me to work . 
  itt : people who think `` free speech '' should mean that you can say whatever you want without repercussions . 
  it 's not `` totalitarianism '' if you lose your job for being an asshole , it 's the system working as intended . 
  you 're responsible for what you say or do and people decide how to treat you as a result . 
  [ link to the full paper ] ( http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf ), 
  the first thing to remember is that there are different types of intelligence . 
  think of school - the kids who were good at math were n't necessarily good at writing . 
  depending on how you define things , you can actually cut intelligence up in a lot of different ways . 
  beyond that , how it actually expresses itself in behaviour is n't necessarily obvious . 
  getting an understanding of why lacking in a certain type of intelligence seems to relate to specific behavioural outcomes tells us more about ( a ) that type of intelligence and ( b ) those behaviours . 
  here 's my position on alt med and other types of pseudoscience . 
  everyone always says `` people should have a right to choose '' and i do n't disagree . 
  what i do n't understand is why , in medicine of all areas , it 's legal to ** sell ** medicines that ** at best ** do nothing . 
   we measured conspiracy ideation using a 15-item general conspiracy beliefs scale ( brotherton , french & pickering , 2013 ) . 
  the scale included items such as `` a small , secret group of people is responsible for making all major world decisions , such as going to war '' ( \u03b1 = .95 ) . 
  responses were made on the following 5-point scale : 1 ) definitely not true , 2 ) probably not true , 3 ) not sure/cannot decide , 4 ) probably true , 5 ) definitely true . 
  [ here is a link ] ( http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279/full ) to the full scale development paper, 
  there are important distinctions between different types of intelligence . 
  they 're all under the superordinate heading of intelligence but that 's like saying all cells are the same because they 're all under the heading of `` cells '' . 
  there are demonstrably different types of intelligence and decades of research on the topic . 
  i 'm using the academic sense of the word . 
  g actually shows us the opposite . 
  it says that while there is a common factor that underlies all forms of intelligence , there are distinct areas in which people differ . 
   empirically , someone who is good at one is very likely good at the other as well . 
  it 's an analogy . 
  it 's designed to show that not all people score equally well across the board in a range of cognitive tests . 
  while there may be a single underlying factor , that does n't actually refute my point that the differences are also important . 
  it 's meaningful if a behaviour is predicted by specific subcategories of intelligence . 
  the fact that , statistically , an underlying factor predicts those subordinate factors does n't in any way relate to my point .

  these are clearly the views of an insane person but i quite enjoyed the animation . 
  fyi - this is a 4chan brigaded post so do n't take anyone too seriously . 
   i do n't know if i should bring it up or not . 
  of all of the possible outcomes of that conversation , which are good ? 
  translation : you should have such low self esteem that you ca n't expect anyone you 're attracted to to also treat you well . 
  if someone is crazy enough to think you 're worthy of basic intimacy you should latch on to them like the desperate spinster you are . 
  this is actually a fantastic idea . 
  what we do is we sell it to telcos , let them ruin it and then buy it back for a markup in 10 years time . 
  it worked for the copper . 
  the really insidious part is that this is how they get re-elected . 
  wait for the campaigning, 
   labor handed us a deficit but we created a surplus ^ by ^ selling ^ everything ^ we ^ could ^ find, 
  imagine if your partner was complaining that you were spending more money than you had and instead of spending less or making more money , you just decided to sell 1/3rd of your house and claim that you now have more money . 
  it 's basically what howard did for a decade . 
  so much this . 
  as all of the top best man speeches in history have told us , this is exactly what all relationships and women are like . 
  that being said , there is actually value to saying sorry even when you do n't think you did the wrong thing . 
  not the `` i 'm sorry you 're upset '' bullshit fake apology but just being sorry for someone else being upset , even if you do n't think it 's `` justified '' . 
  it 's really easy in a marriage to get caught in a fighting each other mentality but the reality is that there 's rarely an obvious right and wrong person . 
  you ca n't spell pyrrhic victory without victory .

  because he 's doing it in a way that is ( a ) bipartisan and ( b ) reaching out to `` middle australia '' . 
  waleed 's impact on the dialogue in australia is huge and given who he 's competing with , that 's a fantastic thing . 
  also , more importantly , people click on it . 
   they 're trying to make it huge . 
  i 'm pretty sure a lot more people watch the project than will read this article . 
  good call , thanks for noticing the typo . 
  the thing that always gets lost in our panic about the `` world going to shit '' is that , by everyone objective standard , we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  we only get so freaked out because ( a ) we know about what happens and ( b ) we expect more . 
  there are already quite a lot of removed comments that are some version of `` well duh '' . 
  it 's important to remember that good science tests folk knowledge , not just novel ideas , for many reasons . 
  1 ) lots of things people assume to be true are n't . 
  if we just assume that our intuitions are correct , we would n't have most of science . 
  2 ) there is nuance to these questions beyond the title of the paper . 
  even just reading the first few sentences of the abstract shows you that there are questions in the literature that this is addressing . 
  3 ) research shows that people tend to respond to psychology research ( real or fake ) by saying that they already believed whatever result you present them with . 
  do n't mistake your post-hoc sense of agreement for something being necessarily true . 
  which is an important distinction . 
  i wonder if that 's equally true for men and how influenced by culture it is . 
  there 's a risk of creating what 's ( somewhat derogatorily ) referred to as a `` just so '' story . 
  which basically means creating a story about the past that fits current data . 
  i think that talking about evolutionary perspectives is always a bit tricky to do well but can still be informative as long as it 's viewed in the right light . 
  it all really depends on what you think is useless . 
  wait , wait . 
  are you trying to say that 18 year olds dying in war is ** better ** ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're wrong . 
  no one is going through more hardship than op having to read about people who do n't want to be bullied as much . 
  that 's the funniest part of all of the complaining about sjws . 
  they 're literally complaining about something that does n't hurt them directly by saying that other people complain too much . 
  nah man , we 're way worse off . 
  now we have to see people posting on facebook that they want safe spaces . 
  having to read that is literally the worst thing that 's happened to anyone . 
  nothing is more badass than complaining about people who complain too much . 
  definitely nothing hypocritical or hilariously sad about that . 
   no one here 's gon na whine with you, 
  yeah , no one on reddit ever whines .
