  why are we subsidizing fuels that we do n't want people using ? 
  not at all , tax breaks are forms of subsidies . 
  they 're paying less tax on an item than average people . 
  ergo , it 's a subsidy . 
  either way , if they 're paying less per litre than everyone else , they 're being * encouraged * to use it . 
  saying that is n't the case completely denies the fact that pump prices are clearly affected by taxes . 
  if an entire industry would crumble without fuel tax credits it may not be the healthiest industry . 
  also , what do you base your assertion that it will crumble on ? 
  that does n't mean that it 's * logical * . 
  we have hundreds of cognitive biases that lead us to less logical choices . 
  that 's not to say anyone is bad or wrong for having them but to assume something is logical because it 's a natural tendency is n't fair . 
  ironically complaining because they need a safe space from people complaining about needing a safe space . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/atheists.png ), 
  i assume this is all a cover-up for the drop in users since the algorithm changed and the front page became so stale . 
   what has reddit done to rollback what pao instituted ? 
  they never said they were going to . 
  the fact that you post insane rants on / r/blackout2015 does n't change the fact that it 's only a very vocal minority that actually want things to move backwards . 
  there has been a shift , just not in the direction you wanted . 
  they 've been communicating better , supporting mods better and starting to actually get rid of some of the disgusting subs around reddit without trying to cram those deletions through loopholes . 
  those are all great changes . 
  just so we 're clear - you think that banning subreddits who harass other users or act in ways that makes reddit unwelcome for others , on a private website , is the same as a government forcing people to change their language at risk of death ? 
  it 's clear alexis was making a joke there . 
  are you also making a joke or are you genuinely making allusions to 1984 ( the edgiest of all allusions ) ? 
  next question : do you believe what you say or is this some brilliant colbert-esque character ? 
  they should 've been smart enough to not be disabled like you . 
  stupid disabled people . 
   you know what helps with steroid related anxiety ? 
  steroids !, 
  so you want to create a massive incentive for people to be involved in a ` destroying their long term health ' arms race just so you can look at better abs at the weigh in ? 
  that makes you an asshole .

   i think the toxic attitude towards anti-vaxxers, 
  i 'm a big fan of live and let live and everyone is entitled to wrong opinions sort of attitudes but when health is involved it 's different . 
  you can make a case that we can reach them better by more civil discussions or something but people die because of this stupidity . 
  it 's not like believing in horoscopes , this has serious implications .

  seriously , it 's like once per card we get the `` x only made y for this fight '' and it 's bullshit 99 % of the time . 
  also , ** if ** nate could only get 20k per fight it 's because he 's a massive pain in the ass to deal with and no one offered him more . 
  sure you can . 
  it 's just potentially wrong . 
  in general , opinions about facts can be either right or wrong . 
  in that case it 's wrong . 
   for example , the flynn effect skews the peak up a bit, 
  which is why it 's re-normed regularly .

  there are many evolved individual and cultural mechanisms that have downsides . 
  hierarchies are very functional in a lot of ways but they obviously have limitations . 
  this is very interesting in the context of some [ recent research ] ( http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/9/1207 ) that shows egalitarian beliefs require mental effort . 
  it seems like we naturally tend towards hierarchical structures . 
  i wonder if the decreased investment relates to a greater expectation of egalitarianism as the norm in modern society . 
  if you found that interesting , you might enjoy this - https://psycho.unibas.ch/uploads/x4epublication/40308/kayetalpsprcompensatorycontrol.pdf, 
  [ enjoy ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/99/5/725/ ), 
  that would be extremely difficult to control in a study . 
  not sure how you could do it . 
  what about this ; you have a group of people all working together on a task , in an egalitarian manner , and rig the task to make them fail . 
  would those people then be more likely to endorse hierarchy ? 
  i do n't know of any work doing that and i think it would be pretty interesting .
