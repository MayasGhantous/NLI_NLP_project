  not at all and you 're still welcome to post it on / r/everythingscience . 
  our aim here is to promote new research which is why we have a hard cutoff of 6 months .

   all we have to do to completely control the content of the subreddit is to report anything that contradicts scientifically-discovered truth . 
  because the bots will just sweep up anything reported , right ? 
  incorrect . 
  reporting something hides it for you but it is n't removed unless a moderator takes an action . 
  you should also be aware that misusing the report button is something the admins take very seriously . 
  it 's referring to banning users , not removing content . 
  normal scenario :, 
  mod bans a user, 
  user receives a message, 
  user responds to message with abuse which sends to mods . 
  mods can either respond or mute the user for 72 hours . 
  shitty users then go on to start abusing again after 72 hours or start pming mods . 
  user ( sometimes ) then gets banned sitewide for harassment, 
  new scenario :, 
  mod bans a user, 
  user receives no message - mods do n't get harassed , users do n't get provoked into saying/doing things they may regret . 
  it 's not a good solution but until the mods have better ways to ban there is n't really a better one . 
  i do n't know what you mean - angry anonymous people on the internet are always kind and lovely . 
  i was under the impression that , like a vending machine , if you say m ` lady 10 times she 's forced to suck your dick . 
  is that not true ? 
  is chivalry truly dead ? 
  researcher adam waytz discusses recent research into empathy and why simply trying to create more empathy in people can backfire . 
  well , waytz is a psychologist and researcher in this area himself but if you want a non-business perspective , paul bloom talks about the limits of empathy in a podcast with sam harris . 
  this is n't new information to the field , empathy is problematic . 
  compassion is a much better goal . 
  right . 
  i moderate multiple subs . 
  if i mute you for abusive messages , i then ca n't see if you 're making rulebreaking comments on my other subs ( likely given your previous character ) . 
  we 've asked for this to be changed many , many times . 
  the only solution is global banning before blocking but for some reason i 'd think you 'd agree that that 's a less reasonable option .

  right . 
  highlighting the absurdity of what he said by making it even more absurd is one form of satire . 
  john oliver satirised televangelists by being an even more absurd version of a televangelist . 
  lol totes weird,
