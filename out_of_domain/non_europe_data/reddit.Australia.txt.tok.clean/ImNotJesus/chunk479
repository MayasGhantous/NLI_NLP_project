   if you are proficient at baiting specials . 
  how does one do that ? 
  [ full paper ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.14/epdf ), 
   it down to simple blaming or shaming , victimizing or ostracisation ? 
  do n't forget the ** most ** important one - dehumanising . 
  dehumanisation is an extremely powerful tool . 
   funny how we have free speech but if you say something some people do n't agree with they try and silence you, 
  that 's the entire point of free speech dingus . 
  the government ca n't stop you from speaking your opinion but that does n't mean that you 're immune from criticism . 
  you 're free to have whatever speech you want and i 'm free to judge you accordingly . 
  not trying to be a dick but i think you mean complicit . 
   no need to make it a conspiracy theory . 
  it 's really easy to see politicians as crooks but the vast majority think they 're doing the right thing . 
  there are very few people who consider themselves evil , instead you have people who are either misguided by ideology or use cognitive biases to reconceptualise self-serving acts as morally good . 
  i never get sick of rich , white , middle aged men complaining about political correctness . 
  when the biggest problem you 've got is other people saying that you 're not sensitive enough about disadvantaged groups , you probably do n't understand being from a disadvantaged group . 
   or selling government property to rent it back off the market later . 
  yeah but we delivered a surplus !, 
  howardnomics 101, 
   and so it continues , the destruction of medicare . 
  ftfy, 
   i asked her how 'd she feel about going out on an official date a few weeks ago and she said that she wanted to just stay friends . 
  she wants to be your friend , not your girlfriend . 
  she may change her mind in the future but you 're not being a friend to her if you are only friendly with the intention of manipulating/guiding her into more . 
  you asked her , she said no , respect that . 
   this is really bothering me because its annoying to hear about this but i also feel jealous as if she is rubbing it into my face about how i did n't have a chance with her even though i felt like i did, 
  she is a human being with free will and welcome to make any mistakes or otherwise she wants . 
  that being said , do n't assume you know what 's best for her . 
  if you respect her enough to want to date her , you should respect her enough to be her own person . 
  if it bothers you too much though , you can always try to define your relationship in such a way that you do n't talk about deeper things . 
   so here is my dilemma , i have to sit next to this girl every day in class and hear her complain about other guys while i 'm stuck in the freindzone . 
  you 're not stuck in the friendzone , she just is n't attracted to you . 
  that 's okay . 
  not everyone is going to be . 
  she wants to be your friend , you can choose to be her friend or not , that 's up to you . 
  if you find it too difficult , just do n't be her friend . 
   its so tempting for me to feel like she is just a ` dumb bitch ' who could n't recognize a good guy that liked her but i know thinking this is ridiculous . 
  and it 's great that you recognise that . 
  it 's much easier to blame her than to feel disappointment . 
   i have no idea how to deal with a girl i 'm going to be sitting next to until june especially when i still have some feelings for her . 
  ask yourself whether you 're happy being `` just friends '' . 
  if the answer is no , distance yourself from her . 
  if the answer is yes , enjoy what there is to be gained from your friendship . 
  as a guy who was n't very confident with girls in high school , i gained a lot of my confidence from having awesome female friends in my early 20s . 
  it made me realise that women i found attractive and cool * could * want to be close to me but that i just had to find one that also found me attractive , so i did and married her . 
  that 's totally your right and you can define the relationship however you like - she then has the right to decide if that type of friendship works for her . 
  it 's normal to have feelings . 
  he should be commended for noticing them and wanting to act appropriately * despite * having feelings of disappointment . 
  i do n't see how you can possibly interpret it that way . 
  nothing he said indicates that she 's rubbing in nose in it more than talking to a friend about things friends talk about . 
  if he does n't feel comfortable talking about those topics with her , as i said , he should tell her . 
  well then it sounds like this deal is working well for both of us !, 
  i have been extremely critical of the greens for their biggest anti-science stance ( i 'm not a fan of their anti-nuclear attitude but i think there is more grey in that question ) . 
  it takes maturity to admit when you 're wrong and they should be commended for changing their stance , not ridiculed for flip-flopping . 
  this is the kind of politics we need , not desperate clinging to bad nbn because you 're scared of looking bad . 
   the anti-science streak in the greens , while probably no larger than the one in the coalition, 
  on balance , it 's significantly less . 
  i think they receive more criticism because they * are * pro-science in so many ways and so loudly declare it . 
  are you implying that only a woman would get into a slapfight on twitter ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  as long as he does n't try it with a k. 
   the regressive left, 
  i 'm so curious about this part . 
  by what definition of the word is an attempt to be more inclusive and sensitive `` regressive '' ? 
   the second part , `` presumable due to where they have posted ? 
  '' , is conjecture on my part based on what some subreddits have begun to do ( like / r/offmychest [ 1 ] for instance ) and preemptively ban people based on which subreddits they post in ( even including / r/european [ 2 ] and / r/undelete [ 3 ] ) . 
  / r/science mod here - we do n't do that , no . 
   these are the kind of people who are big fans of censoring opinions , even without the person ever posting in the subreddit the mod is modding . 
  we `` censor '' anti-science comments because we 're a science subreddit . 
  if you 're looking for an opinions subreddit , askreddit is a better option . 
  absolutely . 
  the ability to grow and learn is something i want in a progressive party . 
   one mod does . 
  i 'd love to see your evidence of a mod banning someone before they made a comment . 
   but there is one mod that was trying to censor any discussion about the existence of white privilege, 
  i saw the ** 3 ** stickies about it on / r/subredditcancer and they were pretty ridiculous . 
   despite the fact that social sciences do n't have the same rigor and reproducibility that ` real ' sciences require . 
  i have like 6 problems with that sentence . 
   then you 've removed this person , correct ? 
  if not , ridiculous might not be the right word . 
  i think you misunderstand which part i found ridiculous .
