   peer review and reproduction of the experiments and results is one of the cornerstones of the scientific process . 
  if you have problems with that sentence , it sounds like they are on your end , not mine . 
  do you , per chance , know the average rate of replication for cancer research ? 
  taking that study as evidence that psychology is unscientific simply betrays your lack of knowledge of how ( a ) probability statistics work and ( b ) the scientific method . 
  i would be happy to have a discussion and explain it to you but i get the sense that you 're not one to change your opinion with new information so i 'd rather save the effort for people who want to learn and grow . 
  either way , every single major journal and university in the world considers psychology a science so i feel little pressure to convince someone on the internet ( clearly with no scientific training ) of this fact . 
  atm fees are regulated in australia and interest rates are `` suggested '' ( which pressures banks to not put them exorbitantly high or collude ) and neither has caused a banking collapse . 
  how will a mysterious amount of money go to an undisclosed charity if this guy ca n't buy the book ?

  was just a joke , and not at your expense . 
  no one in this sub will be able to help you though , best to contact the admins directly or e-mail team amplify as it was their project .

  nope . 
  just an / r/iama mod . 
  the iama mods have kept in touch with her . 
   i 'm here with victoria from innovate, 
   a diversity hire that ca n't spell . 
  614 ... wait a minute !, 
  she has a full-time job . 
  this is just a fun side project . 
  the important thing to remember is that this study is another data point in a long line of studies on the topic . 
  with such a complicated and well researched area , we really need some quality meta-analyses and reviews to parse the data . 
  it 's worth noting that when looking at confounds of other drug use , the authors included smoking cigarettes which seems like a bizarre and potentially bad decision . 
  hopefully someone closer to this topic can advise but that strikes me as a red flag immediately given the large effect size they found for cigarette use . 
  while i understand this is a topic that a lot of reddit users care about and are interested in , please take a moment to read the [ comment rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ) before replying . 
  we would love for this to be an educating and interesting comment section and not simply a graveyard of deleted anecdotes and opinions . 
   and what exactly does `` robust '' mean in this case ? 
   it also sounds like they 're saying that there is a correlation , even if there is n't a causative relation . 
  correct . 
  i 've only skimmed the paper but basically , the authors are arguing that the correlation you can find between iq and weed use is better explained by other factors . 
  it really is true that we get everything america does , just 10 years later . 
  we got our own bush and gitmo now , yay ? 
  because our aim here is to have science discussion and anecdotes/jokes distract from that . 
  we 'd rather have far fewer , higher quality comments than a lot of opinions . 
  if you want opinions / r/askreddit is a more appropriate sub . 
  your post has been removed because this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama .

  i would love to be a conspiracy mod because i 'm very experienced in dealing with conspiracies . 
  from the age of 12 i suspected that my parents were n't my real parents and it turned out that i was right . 
  they tried to censor all of the information but i managed to uncover the truth ... eventually . 
  i had to do some things that i did n't want to do but that 's the point , i 'm committed to the truth and fighting censorship , even if it 's my own parents . 
  i 'll stop at nothing and no one to fight with you . 
  sometimes the admins remind me of my parents will all of their lies and censorship . 
  i ca n't wait to take them down too . 
  the issue is that there 's no theoretical reason , as far as i know , to assume that smoking cigarettes could have causal relationship with iq . 
  the aim of controlling for confounds is to exclude the variance of other factors having a causal relationship . 
  by including variables that correlate highly with the iv ( smoking tobacco and cannabis ) , you simply consume variance without explaining the data , thus helping to get a fully mediated relationship . 
  they only need to say that they were pressured and feared for their jobs to get by that . 
   theoretically , sure . 
  go on ... 
  even without the data i 'd be fascinated to know your theory that will objectively quantify `` quality '', 
  not even / u/frankenmine is this dumb . 
  i think that 's still fairly up in the air . 
  it 's definitely outside my area but i have heard some very strong claims and also some skepeticism about the whole area of [ ego depletion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ego_depletion ) . 
  fascinating area though .
