  hi xiroth , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/41bkbn/the_stanford_professor_who_pioneered_praising/ ) . 
  do you think anyone would ever sign up for a mortgage if they thought that they * could n't * pay it off ? 
  it 's not uncommon to not show statistics in an abstract , there generally is n't space . 
   the result of this paper is n't really that compressible , though , and since the statistics are n't that great i would posit that the author knew he 'd get more attention by not adding any statistics . 
  i think it 's just a difference in how fields do things . 
  more often than not you do n't see them in psych abstracts . 
  not sure why the conventions are different but i really would n't assume about the author . 
  this is kind of awkward but your comment is actually removed . 
  it does n't show you on your end that it has been removed unless you log out . 
  you are welcome to send us a modmail and criticise all you like but as per our comment rules , we only allow on topic discussion . 
  itt : nobody actually reads the article . 
  if that 's all you saw in that fight you 'd probably be happier watching fights on worldstar . 
  better knockout ratio and they just bang bro, 
  sincerely , by what criteria are you claiming that text analysis is n't a real form of science ? 
  this was considered real science by scientists who are working for respected universities , in a science faculty and submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific journal , considered good science by a reviewer and an editor who are also both scientists . 
  what is your argument , other than that you disagree with the outcomes of a paper you likely did n't read , that this ca n't possibly be a valuable contribution to the field ? 
  it might be worth considering , before assuming others are incompetent , that there may be things you do n't have sufficient knowledge or training to understand . 
  i know it 's easier to disregard things outright but you may find more personal growth and knowledge is available when you consider that others might know more than you about certain things . 
  which is quite big for psych . 
   the bell curve makes a very good case . 
  it is also highly controversial because of findings related to race , but i have n't been able to find any criticisms of substance . 
  i 'd be very interested if anyone could provide some . 
  sure , the racial differences have been consistently shown to be better explained by environmental factors ( e.g , parental literacy , education , nutrition etc. ) . 
  there is a huge amount of research on that . 
  another way to show it is that the flynn effect is actually slowing down in many educated/wealthy parts of the world but not in poorer areas . 
  someone more in the area may be able to provide links but my understanding is that it 's completely accepted in the psych community that there 's no meaningful iq difference between races that is due to any genetic component . 
  i like it because it 's a really original and relevant response . 
  technically .3 is actually a `` moderate '' correlation but in the context of predicting such a complex outcome , having one variable relate so strongly is very meaningful . 
  average effect sizes in social psychology are more like .21 -.24 . 
  from memory , the wiki article on this is fairly decent . 
  have a read and let me know if you get stuck on anything - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect, 
  it 's meaningful in research about humans because the effect sizes tend to be really small . 
  there was a brilliant paper ( i can fish out the reference if you need it ) about 10 years that looked at the effect sizes of things that we assume to be true in humans ( things like smoking and lung cancer ) and showed the effect sizes were all surprisingly small . 
  as an example , what do you think the correlation is between the skill of a mlb batter and the chance to hit on a single at bat ? 
  most would assume really high but it 's something like .06 . 
  the moral being that humans are insanely complicated and finding things that explain complex human outcomes , like achievement or even cancer , end up having dozens of real variables . 
  edit : fished out the paper - http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/56/2/128/, 
   oh , and social science is n't real science . 
  i was wrong on the number actually . 
  here are a few i wrote down in my notes :, 
   aspirin and reduced risk of death by heart attack ( r = .02 ) , general batting skill as a major league baseball player and hit success on a given instance at bat ( r = .06 ) , calcium intake and bone mass in premenopausal women ( r = .08 ) , antihistamine use and reduced runny nose and sneezing ( r = .11 ) . 
  and i assume you 've read the paper and seen their discussion on possible fake answers ? 
  why would i debate someone with an ideological position that is considered wrong by everyone who matters on the topic ? 
  name a single top journal or university that considers social science to be not a real science and i 'll concede . 
  he wants to believe that it is n't a real science for whatever reason and i 'm not going to waste my time and energy arguing with him . 
  i love teaching people about science but i 'm not going to yell into the wind for the sake of it . 
  so , let 's be clear then . 
  without reading the paper you can say , with certainty , that it 's bad science ? 
  even though actual scientists wrote it and reviewed it . 
  you may want to consider whether your position is an ideological one or one based on the evidence . 
  i was referring to his comment specifically . 
  if you 'd like to discuss any other comments you are welcome to modmail us . 
  right , which the authors addressed in several ways . 
  again , you ca n't know this because you 're just guessing that they 're wrong . 
  my point is , whether you 're actually right or not that they made mistakes in their study ( spoiler alert , no study is perfect , especially when researching topics where it 's difficult to get disclosure and this is one more piece of data in a whole field of research ) , you need to recognise that your position is entirely ideological . 
  that 's okay , it 's a totally normal thing to do . 
  i 'm just suggesting that perhaps you can see crticising a paper as `` not science '' when you ( a ) are n't an expert in that area and ( b ) have n't even read the paper probably betrays your bias . 
   i 'd like to discuss the premise of not allowing a link to the original data in a supposed discussion on a study of that `` data '' . 
  which is discussion of our policies , not the paper . 
   and here 's my comment which has been deleted . 
  while many comments remain that are not on topic , my comment is on topic has has been shadow-deleted . 
  send us a modmail . 
  i 'm not going to get into an argument in the middle of a random sub about it . 
  because i do n't really care for the input/opinions of the rest of the sub . 
  if you have specific questions , we would be happy to address them . 
  if you want to soapbox in a sympathetic sub , i 'm not interested . 
  the data is n't available in almost all published scientific work . 
  as was explained in the post * and has been explained to you here as well * , we took advice from professionals and banned links to the data . 
  sorry but we care more about the well-being of our users than your crusade against `` censorship '' . 
  likely , yes . 
  but , it gets a lot more complicated than that depending on where that .3 number came from . 
  there may be things that explain both iq and income that were n't accounted for statistically ( they may have been , would have to see the analysis ) . 
  theoretically though , it may contribute far less than that . 
   i 'm criticising their methods . 
  what were their methods ? 
  i 'm not arguing at all , i simply explained why an action was taken . 
  there is no argument to be had - those are the rules and they were enforced appropriately . 
  if you think the rules are wrong , you are welcome to discuss it with the mod team .
