  for what exactly ? 
  you notice the negative more than the positive . 
  the vast , vast majority of users on reddit are decent people , you just do n't see them because they do n't post horrible things . 
  the frustrating thing is that the votes seem to have shifted though . 
  horrible comments used to be less indulged . 
  it 's definitely getting worse . 
  the admins really messed up by not dealing with the disgusting subs sooner . 
  unfortunately the culture has shifted quite a lot on reddit as a result . 
  just to be clear : your theory is that a porn website decided that the best marketing it could do would be to have someone on their website claim to have been raped ? 
  i know there are some bad marketing people out there but on what planet is that anyone 's best idea ? 
  by planting a rape story about themselves ?

  remember that the aim of psychology papers is n't to say how the world * should * be , just to explain how the world * is * . 
  there may be implications of these findings that suggest how to create a world that maximises human flourishing but the aim of the research is n't to demonise comic book heroes , just to describe the effect that these heroes have on the way humans relate to the world .

  alvarez had tuesday night sex with his wife of 20 years . 
  just laid on top of her while they both waited for it to be over . 
  he 's always tempted to cheat on righty with lefty but he does n't because chivalry lives on . 
  but he 's the `` world 's most renowned intellectual '' / s, 
   you can poke fun of the title , and disagree with his view on politics : but he is indeed incredibly renown . 
  i do n't disagree that he is indeed famous . 
  i just hate the clickbaity title . 
   a public modlog 's fine too . 
  there 's a big difference between `` this is how we moderate the sub '' and `` please critique each individual comment removal and ban '' . 
  one is transparency , the other is a nightmare . 
   wait , why does automod remove top comments with 20 or less characters ? 
  those are reported , not removed . 
  the vast majority i see the modqueue are terrible though . . 
   if a comment is removed , does the user get informed why ? 
  no and for multiple reasons . 
  the main reason is simply that we do n't want to have an argument in modmail about every single removal . 
  with the sheer number of low quality comments we get if only a small percentage mailed us about it , it would become too onerous . 
  also , when a top level comment is removed , we also remove all of the children ( with some exceptions ) . 
  this is because it will otherwise spawn dozens of `` what was deleted '' comments which then need to also be removed . 
  when nuking a whole chain , it is n't possible to leave reasons . 
  lastly , it takes moderating comments from a boring job to an even more boring and tedious job having to select/write out reasons each time . 
  which is why they 're reported for checking instead of automatically removed . 
  it * could * be a good comment but it 's a flag that it likely is n't . 
  anecdotally , they 're not good comments more often than not .
