  what specifically do you mean by that ? 
   could you please release the full source code of the automod ? 
  no as that would only encourage people to try and avoid the filters . 
  that 's literally the opposite point of this post . 
  we 're happy to talk about the types of things that are removed and if you message us about a specific comment or post we can get more specific but we are n't going to release the full automod code because that is entirely counter-productive . 
  because the reddit system was designed around popularity . 
  we are n't interested in popular comments , we 're interested in high quality , on-topic comments . 
  what ? 
  the rules are there . 
  we just are n't telling you the specifics of how we find people who break the rules . 
  i do n't really understand your point . 
  to be clear though , the rules are laid out for you in the wiki . 
  we are n't hiding any rules . 
  all we 're hiding is the triggers we use to find the rule * breaking * . 
  there is 0 value in hiding the actual rules . 
   would n't a lot of those comments have genuine value as individual snippets like case studies though ? 
  there 's a big difference between a case study and an anecdote . 
  an anecdote is my interpretation of my own experience . 
  a case study is a formal or semi-formal discussion , by an expert . 
  calling your own opinions a case study is like calling something peer-reviewed because your friend on facebook gave it a ` like ' . 
  they 're data , they 're just not particularly good data when uncontrolled . 
  unfortunately , reddit 's voting system is designed around popularity , not quality content and as such we have to help to curate .

  hey benny shwa , love you on house of pies . 
  it seems like clyde evolved from a lovable goof in the early seasons to being a more deep and nuanced character as time went on . 
  was it fun for you to show off your dramatic muscles a bit more ? 
  is that something you requested or just a natural evolution of the character ? 
  ps : please do more televised improv . 
  we get no live improv in australia . 
  why wo n't anyone love the 1/4 of me that still remains ? 
  even though the brown ones are n't real people ? 
  voting third party does make a difference . 
  even if your preference goes to the slightly less shit ones , it provides a lot of leverage for someone like the greens to swing them back towards the middle .

   i get that harassment is an issue , but it 's an online forum not a nursery, 
  right , i 'm not exactly calling my therapist to talk about the harassment but that does n't mean it 's good or that we should n't try to curb it . 
   mods can just use the shared account to stay anonymous, 
  which is a pain in the ass . 
  i do n't want to have to change accounts every time i respond in modmail . 
  it also then does n't show the other mods who make the comment . 
   the problem is we know a lot of shitty mods have turned it into some kind of ironic honour to be labelled a `` cancerous mod '' . 
  who would do that ? 
  ooo yay . 
  can i choose any flair ? 
  oh that was n't my end goal , i was just excited by the idea once you brought it up . 
  also , it was n't a troll post , i 'd love it . 
  did anyone actually read that drivel of an article or just upvote the headline because they hate the tpp ?

   i 'm curious to see if this research could be expanded to help explain that particular `` gender gap '' . 
  there are lots of answers to this question but to my knowledge , the biggest reason seems to be that men are far less likely to seek help .
