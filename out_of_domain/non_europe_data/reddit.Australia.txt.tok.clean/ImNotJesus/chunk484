  while you may feel better , the research says that it does n't work . 
  in fact , besides the risk of serious injury it 's also related to increased risk of stroke .

  still loaded because it assumes that they are vote manipulating . 
  it 's also not open ended . 
  irrespective of whether or not i agree with you it does n't make a difference , it 's still a loaded question and not open . 
  try / r/answers . 
  it is ** disgusting ** that we allow the ignorance of individuals to get in the way of basic healthcare for children . 
  we should be ashamed of this . 
  ashamed . 
  yeah , i would be changing my name personally . 
  the whole notion of `` criminal justice '' is already archaic . 
  everything we know about psychology and neuroscience says that the entire model needs to be scrapped and we have to start from the beginning . 
  that 's before we even talk about how disgustingly flawed the trial process is ( nature of bias , false memories , almost no actual science going into forensics etc. ) . 
  then we lock people in cages with other criminals , treat them as subhuman and expect them to turn into good members of society . 
  the whole thing is ludicrous and horrifying . 
  i really hope we 're ashamed of it in 100 years . 
  as a meat eater , i really ca n't find a good ethical justification for it beyond that i just want to . 
  i know i 'm not really living up to my principles on it . 
  just think about how bad it would be if we * did n't * scrap the carbon tax . 
  those poor women trying to manage the household budgets !, 
  thank you minister for women . 
  that sounds fantastic . 
  thank you !, 
   there are a lot of strange cases with that sort of thing , where different preferences/features can cause mods to have posts in their own subreddits hidden from them , which is n't generally a good thing . 
  i feel like there are far fewer cases of mods deliberately hiding posts in their own sub than missing posts from blocked users and settings .
