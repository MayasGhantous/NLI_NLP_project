   i just do n't understand how you can be considered ` gay ' when you 're designed to want to have sex with the opposite sex . 
  i 'm not against anything people want to do with their body . 
  i encourage anyone to live out their dreams . 
  but if you have a penis , you should want to put it in a vagina . 
  if you have a vagina , you should want a penis in it . 
  the way it 's going i reckon just drop sexualities all together and refer to everyone as humans . 
  ftfy, 
  gender is more complicated than xy = male , xx = female . 
  it would be really nice for the people who struggle with their gender identity for it to be that easy but you do n't get to choose these things . 
  just as for decades people cried out `` being gay is a choice '' , we just know it 's not true . 
  it 's no different to gender . 
  if the issue is labels , you should consider why you actually care so much . 
  if it helps someone feel more who they are , how does affect your life in any way to call them a she ? 
  correct . 
  so what ? 
   get outta here with your silly biology, 
  he 's not wrong that she has x and y chromosomes , it 's just not relevant to the question . 
  jordan is n't denying the existence of a y chromosome . 
  celia pacquola would like to have a word with you . 
  yes , your attempt at edginess is really cringey . 
  [ sure ] ( http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html ), 
   gender describes the characteristics that a society or culture delineates as masculine or feminine . 
   so while your sex as male or female is a biological fact that is the same in any culture , what that sex means in terms of your gender role as a ` man ' or a ` woman ' in society can be quite different cross culturally . 
  these ` gender roles ' have an impact on the health of the individual . 
   in sociological terms ` gender role ' refers to the characteristics and behaviours that different cultures attribute to the sexes . 
  what it means to be a ` real man ' in any culture requires male sex plus what our various cultures define as masculine characteristics and behaviours , likewise a ` real woman ' needs female sex and feminine characteristics . 
  to summarise :, 
  roundup does n't cause cancer . 
  if you think it does , you need to stop getting your science information from naturalnews and mummy blogs . 
  just because the who says that it technically causes cancer , that does n't mean that it is dangerous at any dose . 
  apples contain cyanide , bananas have nuclear radiation . 
  [ more information on glyphosates ] ( https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/glyphosate-the-new-bogeyman/ ) . 
  you 're welcome to downvote me based on your personal opinion but that does n't change what the science says . 
  dosage and base rates matter . 
  just because something can technically increase your risk of cancer , that does n't mean that it 's a realistic concern .

  there is no good reason to think that glyphosate in our food is a problem , even at the higher doses found in gm crops . 
  [ more information on glyphosates ] ( https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/glyphosate-the-new-bogeyman/ ), 
  there are two types of people who take drugs . 
  the first are people taking drugs to have a good time and are able to control themselves . 
  if they are able to control themselves , they pose no risk to others and we should n't need to worry about them . 
  the other type of people who take drugs are those who are using it to self-medicate or have lost control of their lives . 
  while it may be scary to think of the latter group as a sick person in need of help , not doing so forces us to dehumanise victims and treat them as moral failures . 
  they are victims . 
  they are sick and need our help but instead we treat them as a dehumanised other , not realising that the only difference between `` us '' and `` them '' is a bit of luck . 
  some different genes , a few different experiences and you could be that person on the street desperate for a fix . 
  no one * wants * to end up there , it happens because a sick person does n't have a better way to cope . 
  i do n't use drugs . 
  i have absolutely no desire to take pills and hit up a rave but the evidence is totally overwhelming - treating drug use as a criminal act has horribly backfired everywhere in the world . 
  meanwhile , portugal are showing everyone that compassion and education are ( shock horror ) much more effective tactics . 
  personally , i was strongly against drug legalisation until i heard an interview with johann hari . 
  here is a [ ted talk - everything you think you know about addiction is wrong ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong?language=en ) - he did but i do recommend finding a longer interview if you can . 
   but despite di natale 's insistence otherwise , providing free pill testing kits absolutely condones the use of illicit drugs . 
  of course , some people were always going to do it anyway . 
  for others , the prospect of getting a bad batch was a very real disincentive that will be removed with the availability of pill testing . 
  we should n't * need * seatbelts . 
  if everyone did the right thing it would be completely unnecessary . 
  i would defintely be less likely to speed if i did n't have seatbelts in my car . 
  should we remove my seatbelt to create a `` very real disincentive '' to speed ? 
  if anything , that makes more sense since me speeding is actually dangerous to others . 
   since the greens no doubt want this pill testing paid for by the government , essentially we are taking taxpayer money and using it to stimulate the black market . 
  if he is serious about harm minimisation , i would prefer he focus his efforts on legalisation . 
   using tax payer 's money to promote illicit drug use is not sensible . 
  and abstinence only sex education works too right ? 
  it 's the exact same argument used by critics of both . 
   we ca n't teach teenagers about safe sex , they 'll just have more sex !, 
  that 's why abstinence only education happens . 
  pill testing is like teaching your teenager about safe sex . 
  so taking pills safely is bad because they 're illegal . 
  and because it 's bad we should n't try to increase safety when people are going to use them anyway . 
  correct ? 
   it 's not the taxpayer 's responsibility to weave a safety net under the activities you partake in outside the confines of the law . 
  should the public hospital treat them if they get sick from a pill ? 
  which part of the analogy does n't fit ? 
  right , the who is n't wrong , the person in that interview just does n't really understand how statistics work . 
  glyphosate probably does increase the rate at which people get cancer , so does cooking your toast for too long . 
  bananas also are full of radiation but they 're not dangerous because of the amount you actually eat . 
  what matters are three things ( a ) base rate incidence , ( b ) effect size and ( c ) dosage . 
  there is absolutely no reason to think that glyphosates , used appropriately , are any risk at all . 
  so if it 's your own actions that cause you to need the help then we should n't give it , right ? 
  should i be able to get public hospital treatment for lung cancer if i smoked ? 
  how about if i 'm overweight and have health problems ? 
  what if i 'm in a car accident that was someone else 's fault but i was speeding a little bit ? 
  what amount of `` you deserved it '' means that someone no longer deserves public help ? 
   by this logic , why should i pay for you breaking an arm when on a jetski ? 
  you chose to drive a car knowing there was a risk . 
  i have an antimatter garden .
