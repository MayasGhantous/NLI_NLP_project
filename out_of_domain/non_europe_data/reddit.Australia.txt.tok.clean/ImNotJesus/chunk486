  hi cathal __ haughian , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 5 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5 - ) and appears to be soap-boxing , or otherwise is a rhetorical or loaded question . 
  you 're welcome to rephrase it and post again in a way more inviting of real discussion .

  i 'm sorry to hear that you 're in such a dark place . 
  askreddit ca n't help you and i 've removed your submission . 
  there 's / r/suicidewatch where well-meaning and sympathetic people will try and help , but be aware they are n't trained . 
  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  also , this relates to some important information about askreddit that we announced previously . 
  [ click here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3dbhkt/important_news_about_the_future_of_askreddit_1/ ) for more info . 
  i would totally vote for a k banner, 
  i try not to drug the women i kiss . 
  always . 
  oppressing the masses is a laugh a minute . 
  sure let me just ... wait a minute !,

  two . 
  feeling generous . 
   i had 3 askreddit questions removed recently because they did n't end in a question mark . 
  did you not think to add one after the first 2 times ? 
   are you going to take it on yourself to remove this post ? 
  it breaks many other rules too . 
  the three things i hate most are, 
  mods who distinguish their comments when they do n't need to . 
  lists, 
  yeah but if they do things then they 'd need to do stuff and the admins do n't like having to do stuff . 
  unless that stuff is random projects that are abandoned 8 months after they 're announced . 
  thunder could have been better . 
  imagine if they had durant , westbrook , ibaka and harden on the same team . 
  right but it 's clearly not working . 
  most defaults have inactive top mods . 
   tl ; dr : the world is predatory ; not securing your website or doing anything about inactive mod accounts is dangerous . 
  ftfy, 
   still hoping that whole `` we 're working on it '' was n't just the platitude it 's starting to feel like . 
  they 'll do it right after they fix modmail . 
  * starts holding breath *, 
  2 of my 3 subs are the same colour . 
  i asked them to change it , they did , then it reverted randomly . 
  but all that money you save by not driving anywhere should go into your investment properties . 
  credit to : `` the simpsons against the liberals '' on facebook, 
  there 's a very well established literature showing that theists do n't trust atheists . 
  so there is prejudice against both homosexuals and atheists . 
  but , the prejudice against atheists seems to be driven primarily by distrust while the prejudice against homosexuals seems to be more driven by disgust . 
  happy to send you some literature if you 're interested in the topic . 
  happy to help but you should credit will gervais , azim shariff and ara norenzayan since it 's primarily their research . 
  [ full paper ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/tessa_dover/publication/283314948_members_of_high-status_groups_are_threatened_by_pro-diversity_organizational_messages/links/5633f5e608ae758841121d51.pdf ), 
  firstly , a basic regression by definition does n't control for confounds because it only has 1 predictor variable . 
  second , a regression would be a bizarre way to analyse that sort of data since your key iv is categorical . 
  third , what confounds are you concerned about ? 
  i get that you 're trying to sound really smart but you achieved the opposite pal . 
  i agree in theory that companies should hire the best person for the best job . 
  but , i think there are 3 good arguments for diversity hiring policies ( which are a blunt solution to complicated problems ) . 
  1 ) bias exists . 
  everyone is biased all the time . 
  it is simply an empirically verifiable fact that certain groups are likely to have bias hold them back for all sorts of reasons . 
  easy example of this ; ceos are disproportionately tall . 
  there 's no logical reason to believe that ceos need to be tall to be good at their job and i do n't think hr groups are writing `` tall '' on their wishlist . 
  there must be some underlying unconscious bias that taller people are somehow dominant or leaders or the like and thus they have an advantage . 
  unfortunately , it 's also true that women and minorities face bias when it comes to placement in many positions . 
  the number of women in orchestras ** skyrocketed ** when they started blind auditions . 
  2 ) ** on average ** , the path of someone of a minority is likely to be harder until that point in time than someone who is n't in a minority . 
  using college as an example , if you have a black kid from a poor community against a white kid from a good community with the same marks and no other information , you can assume that the black kid faced more adversity in getting that same result and thus is more deserving . 
  3 ) finally , there is intrinsic value in having people other than white men in positions of power . 
  there are lots of reasons for this but not least of which is that it makes others in that group more likely to aspire to higher positions . 
  the data on black kids who believe that they could be president one day before and after obama was elected is staggering . 
  perhaps we 're not seeing the best minority and female politicians because they do n't genuinely believe they have a shot ? 
  that really depends on what you mean by safe spaces . 
  i find that whenever the topic comes up , both sides are talking about very different things . 
  as for trigger warnings , they 're about decency and respect for people 's difficulties . 
  if you find it so patronising , you may want to consider what that says about your ability to empathise with other people 's situations . 
  even if you have been through something extremely traumatic , it 's also worth remembering that everyone heals differently . 
  yeah this post is super offensive and condescending . 
  all we need to do is educate them poor black folk and tell them why we know what they want better than they do . 
  ironically , it 's virtually identical to the `` women should vote for hillary '' stuff that this sub rails so angrily against . 
  the whole attitude is condescending . 
  you 're talking about black people as some group who do n't know what they want and need to be educated by the smart white man who knows what 's best for them . 
  do n't assume you know what 's best for other people , especially in the context of something you do n't have experience in . 
  also , do n't assume that any member of a minority is a one issue voter . 
  they may be black and respect bernie 's civil rights record but disagree with him on any number of issues . 
  is n't the latter necessarily true if the former is ? 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/1386/ ), 
  my fellow australians . 
  as a young boy , i dreamed of being a football ; but tonight i say , we must move housing prices forward , not backward ; upward , not forward ; and always twirling , twirling , twirling towards freedom !, 
  where where ? 
   it 's great how there are still wars going on , but there is plenty of time for political grandstanding . 
  that 's an absurd false equivalence . 
  it 's also not just irrelevant but highly insulting to the people who care about something as insignificant as not being able to afford a house . 
  those selfish monsters . 
  but you 're right , we should vote on the single most important issue at any given time and only ever talk about that one thing . 
   edit : lol , insult m ` ludlam ? 
  imply that the greens are political demagogues ? 
  make a point about politicians ignoring large issues while playing stupid personality games ? 
  time for the / r/australia pile on !, 
  all anger , no substance .
