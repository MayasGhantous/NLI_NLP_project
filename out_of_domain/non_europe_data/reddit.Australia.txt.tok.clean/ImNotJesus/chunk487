  yup there 's literally no reason that anyone would ever think you 're a donkey except for `` circlejerking '' and bias . 
  there 's just not a single reason to think what you said was ludicrous . 
  top notch self-reflection there pal . 
  would n't it make more sense for the greens to use it since it implies that you 're fucked either way with liblab ?

   fegan forgot one of the most important values of being a players agent and that is , do n't let your client be the one to look bad . 
  and in the dj situation he was the one who * deserved * to look bad . 
  dude put his relationship with cuban above his client . 
  fegan is not a good guy .

  as an / r/nba fan i love the idea . 
  as an / r/askreddit and / r/science moderator , i caution that having comment rules is massively labor intensive and would likely require a significantly larger mod team . 
  there are different ways to handle the workload effectively but it 's not as simple as slapping on a tag and comments improve . 
  but he 's one of the / r/niceguys . 
  if that bitch michelle did n't friendzone him she 'd see that he 's one of the good ones . 
  which is kind of the point . 
  if 1-1 replications were a perfect test of whether the original results were correct , this whole conversation would be a lot simpler . 
  exactly . 
  you put the same two chemicals in a beaker and they will react basically the same way each time . 
  you get two humans and even if you control for 100 different things ( religion , age , ses , political persuastion , gender , ethnicity etc. ), 
  they 're still wildly different people . 
  that 's why when you look at research on humans , effect sizes are [ much smaller ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/56/2/128/ ) . 
   ok so if i refuse to date black girls , asian chicks , or muslims then is that alright if i 'm not attracted to them ? 
  or is that bigoted ? 
  both can be true . 
  you 're right , my weird stalker . 
  posting about my opinions on a website designed to discuss opinions is * way * weirder than following around a stranger commenting on what they comment on . 
  what a bizarre obsession i have with my own opinions !, 
  you should n't date people you are n't attracted to . 
  it 's totally okay to not be attracted to certain types of looks . 
  that lack of attraction can also come from bigotry . 
  the two are n't mutually exclusive . 
   you simply appear like batman, 
  as opposed to what ? 
  that 's literally how commenting on websites works . 
  would you prefer to see a video of my looking through different posts and deciding to comment ? 
  ironically , you must spend as much time on `` white knighty '' topic posts as i do to see me so often . 
   there was a point not long ago where the moderators here were actively doing promotional work for monsanto in the form of iama 's etc framed in a very pro-corporate light . 
  just to be clear , we host amas from hundreds of practicing scientists in almost every field of science . 
  you were upset by a small handful that were on a topic that you have particular issues with . 
  monsanto scientists are world leaders in what they do and your personal perception of their business practices has no bearing on whether or not the science should be discussed . 
  if anything , the perceptions of monsanto are even * more * reason to be bringing in industry scientists to discuss the myths and realities of an incredibly politicized field .
