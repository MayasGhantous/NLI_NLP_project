  hi arin32 , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  * it violates [ [ rule 2 ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2 - ) : it is an overly specific advice question too limiting in opportunities for discussion or community involvement . 
  you can include loose context to how you relate to the question , but the question should focus on the community 's input , and not be for your benefit alone . 
  for personal matters , consider / r/advice , / r/needadvice , / r/relationships , or / r/self .

  social psychology should be proud as hell that we 're leading everyone else in efforts to peer-review right now . 
  peer-review does n't end at publication . 
  this is science working as intended , even if the process is hard or you take some knocks from a public that do n't necessarily understand . 
  if you became a researcher to prove things you already believe , you 're kind of missing the point . 
  if you came to discover the truth , you should be happy we 're getting better at discovering the truth .

   way too many questions for an unpaid job, 
  it 's a big time commitment to mod a default and if that does n't interest you , it 's best for both parties to not apply . 
  which is part of the point . 
  the vast majority of people do n't want to spend their time moderating . 
  for those that do , a handful of questions is n't really a problem . 
  you mean over or under the table ? 
  hey everyone ,, 
  just a reminder that while we understand it may feel helpful to talk about your experiences with depression , the aim of this sub is to keep discussion on the science itself and away from personal anecdotes . 
  this is partly because these chains are mostly descending into pseudoscientific advice and partly because we aim to have scientific discussion on all topics , even when it is a sensitive area . 
  if you are unfamiliar with our commenting rules , please read more about them [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ) . 
  there are several communities on reddit where you can discuss your mental illness experience with like minded individuals . 
  if you have n't seen a professional , i recommend consulting one if you feel that you may suffer from a mental illness or if psychological distress is affecting your day to day living . 
  there is certainly room for personal anecdote in qualitative research . 
  this post is n't a research piece and we 're not collating opinions . 
  the express aim of this sub is to proliferate scientific knowledge and personal opinions/anecdotes run counter to that aim . 
  personal anecdotes are okay on literally 99 + % of reddit .
