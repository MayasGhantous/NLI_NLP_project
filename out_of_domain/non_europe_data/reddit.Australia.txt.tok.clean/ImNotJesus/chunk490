  she 's politically extremely similar to obama who has clearly been a net positive for america . 
  it would be great for someone to come in and shift some paradigms like bernie would hope to but steady forwards movement is good . 
  so because you do n't personally believe something that is widely accepted in science despite having never actually studied the issue you 're ready to dismiss professionals who understand the topic ? 
  cool . 
  security theatre gets votes and it always has .

  do those proton collisions cure cancer ? 
  sex , penis , vagina , sex , fart , sex , super heroes lhc scientist, 
  sorry , i thought we were doing ifl science headlines . 
  how so ? 
  if a study kills a certain cancer cell in a petri dish , you ca n't make a headline saying `` scientists cure cancer '' since that would be misleading . 
   rr , ci , and p-values, 
  we 've talked about things like this but then there are issues with journal access .

  [ john oliver explains why it matters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmoax9f6moc ), 
  says this opinion piece on a news site that contains only stolen material . 
  this is one of those spam websites that steal content from news sites and then spam them around social media hoping something hits . 
  the whole article is a copy-paste from https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/03/29/hillary-clinton-must-face-the-music-and-the-fbi/, 
  i waned to do a fake `` safe space '' post where i made fun of people complaining about `` muh free speech '' . 
  basically , from time to time we ban people for being giant , unrelenting assholes and they always respond with some version of `` whatever happened to free speech '' ( generally after lecturing us on what science is `` supposed to be about '' ) . 
  to which i like to reply, 
   let me be the first to apologize on behalf of the entire mod team . 
  i understand that this must be difficult for you but allow me to explain . 
  i 'm sorry that you wanted / r/science to be a safe space for you but it 's just not possible to provide that . 
  it 's clear that you wanted us to create an environment where there are no repercussions for your actions but the world does n't work like that . 
  we ca n't wrap you up in cotton wool and protect you from the repercussions of your actions . 
  i know you 're disappointed but there are safe spaces out there that you could go to . 
  have you considered voat ? 
  they 're very tolerant of people like you . 
  so basically i wanted to do a modpost version of that . 
  this is like the anti-vax of pokemon opinions . 
  motion to remove sifav6 as mod . 
  you mean the hilluminati right surf ? 
  as long as she swallows i do n't mind . 
  i 'm ethically against it and morally for it . 
  tl ; dr more monsanto, 
  we still have posts that are n't social science but we 're headed in the right direction . 
  no it looked terrible . 
  you ? 
  trojan, 
  would you settle for a hoverboard that does n't actually hover ? 
  i was studying business and realised that i was spending my spare time reading about psychology . 
  yes . 
  nazism and crushing dissent . 
  because people do n't post/upvote it enough . 
  and you 're one of my favourite users voaqlezia2iu, 
   what , in your opinion , is the worst part of moderating r/science ? 
  the idiots in modmail, 
   what , in your opinion , is the best part of moderating r/science ? 
  the idiots in modmail, 
  fun fact , the mod team , as a group , had the tie breaking vote on that . 
  i replied to kerovon 's comment already !, 
  i 'm buried because of racist timezones .
