  as a parent of a young child and someone with a knowledge of psychology , i was really struck by how attachment parenting seems to lead to the exact opposite of secure attachment . 
  from my anecdotal experience , it seems like the all three popular myths you listed , and attachment parenting in particular , are propelled by the incredibly damaging sense that women should have everything they need to make their baby happy all the time . 
  it seems that the most anxious mothers are those who do n't allow their children to deal with distress in small , controlled doses and thus constantly confirm their need to be overbearing with their children because of their inability to deal with distress . 
  firstly , do you agree that these myths are attractive to women for that reason ? 
  if so , how do we fight against the guilt associated with not being able to fix all of your child 's problems instantly ? 
  finally , for the anxious parent how do you short circuit that cycle of deskilling their child leading to greater anxiety ? 
  you would n't expect that to be common enough to add more than a little noise to the data . 
  it 's a valid criticism but with randomised groups it 's unlikely it had a big effect . 
  the article is n't the best so hopefully this clarifies what they found a little bit . 
  basically , there 's a commonly used test called the `` go/no go '' task where words are flashed up on the screen for the participant . 
  the challenge is to either press a key ( go ) when a word matching a certain criteria pops up ( normally in under 700ms ) and to press nothing when a word that does n't match pops up . 
  in this case , they gave half of the participants tylenol and half had a placebo . 
  they found that errors were not significantly different for the `` go '' items but they were for the `` no go '' items . 
  they also found that less activation in specific areas of the brain were associated with the greater rate of error . 
  they argue that it takes participants * longer * to register an error item when on tylenol . 
  whether this has any real word effect outside of a tiny difference in latency is impossible to say from these results but it does suggest this is worth further research . 
  it 's definitely not quite that simple . 
  this is more due to very minor differences in brain activity due to the effects of the medication . 
  apparently these authors have found some other differences too . 
  perhaps if you do n't know enough about the dsm to know which volume we are up to , it could suggest you are n't knowledgeable enough on the topic to comment on a giant collaboration worked on by thousands of practicing scientists .

  where do you think most grant money comes from ? 
  hey everyone ,, 
  this is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings . 
  if you are feeling like you are not coping , please know that there are resources out there available to you . 
  there are [ crisis services worldwide ] ( https://www.iasp.info/resources/crisis_centres/ ) that are trained to provide support . 
  these centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems , can help you get through a tough hour/night/week . 
  otherwise , if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope , i strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area . 
  just as you would see a doctor when you are sick , you deserve to take care of your mental health . 
  stay safe people . 
  i think one of the challenges in dealing with racial/gender bias is that people are generally unwilling to admit that they are capable of implicit bias . 
  in reality , we are all biased all the time and stereotypes about race and ingroup biases obviously make a difference . 
  assuming that these judges are all good people who genuinely believe themselves to be acting fairly ( which is likely true for most ) , how do we combat an issue where people do n't realise , and are unlikely to accept that , they 're doing the wrong thing ?

  i think you are overestimating how rational you and others are in discussion of deeply held beliefs . 
  humans are estimation machines that work on rules of thumb . 
  it 's fantastic to be aware of bias and try to discuss things as rationally as possible but never assume that a certain method makes you immune from bias . 
  the most important thing is just to be aware of your own biases . 
  assume that you are interpreting the world in a biased way and make every effort to assume that others * could * be correct . 
  there 's no panacea here though - humans are biased . 
  i think the fantastic point there is that everyone assumes that it 's * others * who are biased . 
  as for different countries , i ca n't assume it 's any different to america . 
  we have decades of evidence that shows that all you need to do to create ingroup differences is just tell people that they 're in different groups . 
  you can literally show the particiapnts that you 're drawing names out of a hat and immediately people will show preference towards their ingroup ( [ some reading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimal_group_paradigm ) ) . 
  the vast majority of human history was living in tribes . 
  we are a tribal species that learns young to preference our ingroup . 
  great example . 
  one thing i always teach my undergrads is that you should n't think of our brains as calculators , they 're estimation machines . 
  we work based on useful ` rules of thumb ' that are mostly right . 
  the problem is that these rules of thumb were developed in a very different environment to the one we live in now and they were built for speed , not accuracy . 
  the rule of thumb `` more calories = better '' , is n't a good strategy when you can walk to shops . 
  in the same way , the strategy of assuming that you are mostly right about strongly held views is a fantastic rule of thumb when you 're on the plains of africa . 
  it 's not adaptive for a hunter gatherer tribe to be constantly questioning everything they hold as true . 
  if , however , you live in a world where mass communication means that it 's really easy to seek out confirmatory evidence and argue with others who hold strong opinions , it leads to being wrong about things . 
  cognitive biases are estimations that provide ** quick ** answers .
