  changing your opinion is antithetical to that . 
  every single person in the world is biased about countless things and in a range of different ways . 
  the problem is n't that people are biased , it 's that people are n't aware that they 're biased and how ( [ some fun reading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases ) ) . 
  which is true of most `` the world sucks '' kind of claims . 
  by almost all objective criteria we live in the best world that has ever existed . 
  the fact that you 're constantly outraged by things tells you that we are * moving forward * and you now have higher expectations . 
   political participation and political deliberation are both desirable , but they may be mutually exclusive . 
  is it good for discourse if the only people involved are those with the most extreme views ? 
   does this mean being biased is always bad ? 
  ca n't an individual be biased and right ? 
  absolutely . 
  you are probably right about most things . 
  biases are generally adaptive . 
  it 's adaptive to believe yourself to be right about most things . 
   so i know im biased and if you believe that we are n't hairless apes , you are wrong . 
  right ? 
  we could quibble about definitions but i would agree with this . 
  bias can help to maintain good * or * bad beliefs .

  curious about what precisely ? 
  correct . 
  heuristics are the ` rules of thumb ' i was referring to which leads to biases in outcomes . 
  to what extent do you think knowledge of one 's genetic disposition affects behaviour both positively and negatively ? 
  i can imagine that in some situations , knowledge of a likelihood to have certain illness would lead to better health choices but for others it may lead to `` fuck it i 'm going to die of x anyway '' . 
  hey everyone ,, 
  this is just a friendly reminder that discussion of suicide can be really difficult for those who are going through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings . 
  if you are feeling like you are not coping , please know that there are resources out there available to you . 
  there are [ crisis services worldwide ] ( https://www.iasp.info/resources/crisis_centres/ ) that are trained to provide support . 
  these centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems , can help you get through a tough hour/night/week . 
  otherwise , if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope , i strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area . 
  while it is * common _ * to experience periods of mental illness , that does n't make your experience normal or inevitable . 
  just as you would see a doctor when you are sick , you deserve to take care of your mental health . 
  stay safe people . 
  [ full paper ] ( http://www.skatherinenelson.com/uploads/2/7/1/7/27172343/nelson_et_al._2016_emotion.pdf ), 
   there is a very large body of work , conducted in humans , non-human primates , and other animals that directly contradicts these results, 
  actually there are quite a few studies supporting this . 
  the general consensus in the subjective well-being ( swb ) / happiness literature is that people have rough swb set points and do n't deviate drastically because they habituate to what they have . 
  if you buy yourself an amazing new tv , it does n't take long until you 're used to that tv and it 's no longer giving you happiness . 
  there was a very famous study showing that after 6 months both amputees and lottery winners return to their midpoint of happiness [ great but slightly outdated ted talk on the topic ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy?language=en ) . 
  there is , on the other hand , plenty of evidence that doing positive things for other people can increase swb , at least temporarily , far more than doing nice things for oneself . 
  the first paragraph of the introduction has a sizable list of some of those references .

  it 's been done lots of times before . 
  not sure exactly how it works but there are a range of studies on it . 
  correct . 
  [ relevant ted talk ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en ), 
  what this study added is putting that in the context of moral foundations theory ( see the ted talk i linked above ) . 
  in short , the idea is that different people have sensitivity to violations of specific moral domains and these can be drawn out to some degree on party lines . 
  as conservatives are more concerned with the binding foundations ( ingroup , authority , purity ) the aim is to see whether appealing to those domains makes environmentalism more appealing, 
  while `` patriotism '' is certainly in the spirit of the binding foundations , it 's not traditionally one of the subscales . 
  interesting choice to include it . 
  the relationship between religiosity and the binding foundations is actually one of the bases of how it was developed . 
  that being said , a study came out only a few days ago saying that it was n't very predictive of religiosity in the black community - [ link ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/110/4/e23/ ), 
  ** background ** : this paper is extending a model called [ moral foundations theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_foundations_theory ) ( mft ) . 
  mft is the idea that individuals are going to be more or less sensitive to violations of specific domains . 
  for example , conservatives tend to moralise the purity domain that includes things like deviant sex . 
  what haidt and graham found ( the two creators of the theory ) was that the foundations split on party lines . 
  liberals tend to be concerned with harm and fairness while conservatives are equally concerned with all domains ( ingroup , authority and purity ) - ( [ ted talk ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en ) ) ( [ image ] ( http://geraldguild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/moral-divergence-by-political-identity.png ) ) . 
  ** this paper ** : the aim of this paper is to see whether appealing to values that are relevant to conservatives ( also know as thew binding domains since haidt argues that they serve to bind communities ) can change the views of conservatives on the environment . 
  as liberals are less concerned with these domains , appealing to values in those domains * should n't * have an impact . 
  they found that presenting a binding pro-environmental frame significantly moderated the effects of political orientation on conservation intentions , attitudes about climate change , and donations to an environmental organization . 
  in short , when framed the right way , conservatives were almost as likely as liberals to act in an environmentally conscious way . 
  ** what does this tell us ? 
  ** while it is n't surprising that different groups have different values , what this paper does is further reinforce that the standard framing of issues can tend to polarise people on party lines because individuals tend to appeal to values that they care about . 
  importantly , it shows that attempts to bridge party gaps on sometimes partisan issues needs to be done while considering the values of other groups . 
  everyone is biased towards their ingroup . 
  the difference is that conservatives tend to moralise violations of the ingroup to a greater extent than liberals . 
  of course . 
  the stated aim of mft was to try and capture the moral concerns of not just liberals which can often be treated as the normative position by researchers . 
  anyone who claims that liberals are not subject to bias does n't know the first thing about basic human psychology . 
  for what ? 
  moralising different domains ? 
  that research has been around for 10 years . 
  [ this ] ( http://geraldguild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/moral-divergence-by-political-identity.png ) is taken from the seminal paper on mft . 
  data comes from [ this paper ] ( http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/ghn2009.pdf ), 
  [ here you go ] ( http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/ghn2009.pdf ), 
  that 's a good question and probably depends on why people are anti-vax . 
  i would suggest that the answer is likely no since it falls equally across party lines . 
  it 's likely that some other underlying factor is driving anti-vaccine beliefs .
