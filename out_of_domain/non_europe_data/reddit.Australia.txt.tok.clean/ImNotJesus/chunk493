  average correlation in social sciences in .27 , similar to that in medical studies . 
  humans are complicated . 
  this is a really good example of a situation where some hesitation should be taken about inferring causation from a correlational relationship . 
  for those who are n't aware , a correlation between two things means that , on average , people who score high on one of those traits ( psychopathy in this case ) , also * tend * to score high on another trait ( creativity ) . 
  when there is a significant correlation ** and ** other reason to think a causal relationship may exist ( one occuring before the other , extent theory etc. 
  ) , we can sometimes make hesitant claims that one thing may cause another . 
  in this case , the title implies that psychopathic like thinking * creates * better creativity but there is no evidence of that in the data as the results are purely correlational . 
  it is certainly possible that it does but we would need much more evidence to make that claim . 
  at best , we can say that the two * tend * to co-occur which * may * still be meaningful . 
  it ** could ** tell us that being psychopathic leads to being more creative , it could also mean that being more creative leads to greater psychopathy . 
  it could also mean that both variables are caused by a range of other variables . 
  it 's really important to remember that each study ( or set of studies ) is just another data point in a series of conversations about how these ideas fit together . 
  this study is n't a silver bullet but nothing is , it 's just more information . 
  so , do n't disregard the findings but try to understand them in the correct context . 
  tl ; dr correlations are meaningful and sometimes indicate a causal relationship but in this case there is insufficient evidence to make a causal claim . 
  of course . 
  the important thing , however , is to find good reasons to critique a study and to understand it in an appropriate context . 
  if you sit in a room of academics discussing a paper , you wo n't find a more critical audience . 
  the difference to what we often see on reddit , however , is that learning comes from both picking the good * and * bad parts out of a paper . 
  a nuanced view does n't reject a finding for a single methodological concern . 
  you 're absolutely thinking about it the right way . 
  normally you do a few descriptive studies first ( describing the world as it is - not manipulating anything ) . 
  once you 've done that , you can start to vary the moving parts to see what it changes . 
  it 's not always possible for this kind of individual difference work however .
