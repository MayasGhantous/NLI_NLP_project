  this is a generic sticky that we 're trying out in an attempt to improve the discourse . 
  it relates to this study in that it 's the way we should approach all studies . 
  considering different options . 
  a huge proportion of our users navigate from the front page so while it may be ignored by regular users , they 're not necessarily the ones we 're trying to reach . 
  thanks . 
  the bar to entry is already very high in this sub with strict headline rules and the general lack of access for non-academic users . 
  it also adds a huge amount more work for the mods, 
  definitely worth considering . 
  thanks . 
  how ? 
  every door of opportunity that the previous generation had is being shut behind them . 
  ignoring how patently wrong your comment is ... to be clear , your argument that it is n't true is that lots of people think it is true ?

  it really does n't seem to be an issue of experience or quality of researcher/journal . 
  for example , a huge effort recently tried to replicate the ego depletion findings of baumeister and colleagues and were n't able to do so . 
  baumeister is one of the biggest names in all of psychology research . 
  a similar issue happened with some priming work by john bargh , another extremely famous and well respected researcher . 
   it plays a big role in getting tenure and so drives fraud and negligence . 
  i think doing science is hard enough that we can assume this is well-meaning , honest research . 
  there are dozens of factors leading to the current replication rates , none of which require malicious intent . 
  there are obviously diedrick stapels out there but no one gets into academic psychology for money and prestige . 
  absolutely . 
  every research finding is a probabilistic statement where you are claiming something is ** likely ** to be true . 
  if you do n't / ca n't account for the times that something ** did n't ** happen , you get more error . 
  to put it another way , assume i have a 20 sided die and have a theory that every time i roll it with my left hand i get a 20 . 
  if i roll the die 1000 times but only tell you about the times i get a 20 , i 'll get roughly 50 by chance alone . 
  if the only information you have is that i rolled it 50 times and got 50 20s , it may start to seem plausible . 
  which is what makes this issue so complicated . 
  the other reality is that it 's really easy to convince yourself of something you want to be true . 
  [ check this out ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/ ), 
  they said that bernie was n't going to win the nomination so obviously they 're biased . 
   there are real problems here with deliberate fraud . 
  what evidence do you have for this extremely large claim ? 
  i 'm not really sure what point you 're trying to make . 
  i was responding to a claim that the level of researcher might be relevant and i was saying that it is n't necessarily . 
  it 's a journal issue . 
  which is true in theory but not reality . 
  in reality we have what are called `` researcher degrees of freedom '' . 
  all research requires making decisions and assumptions and those decisions and assumptions change results . 
  there 's no such thing as `` pure '' research , it 's a human endeavour . 
   the problem with biology is that everything can change based on the lighting of the room , what day it is , and what mood you 're in . 
  i mean , this is genuinely true . 
  how sunny it is can affect happiness research . 
  humans be complicated . 
  to some degree . 
  the equation * can * be changed elsewhere but if we are talking about * publishing * null results the thing we need most is journals to actually do it . 
  exactly . 
  this issue is n't one that affects psychology alone , psychology are just doing the best work right now at self-policing . 
  it 's also not a new problem or one * only * identified by psychology . 
  only 3 years ago there were articles about the [ `` replicability crisis in cancer research '' ] ( http://www.scilogs.com/next_regeneration/the-replicability-crisis-in-cancer-research/ ) . 
  criticising psychology for doing science the way it should be ( with rigorous replication testing ) is like yelling at your child because they rechecked their homework and found a mistake . 
  and in my previous comment i acknowledged that it obviously happens . 
  to call them anything but outliers is silly though . 
  you wo n't find a more skeptical group than scientists .
