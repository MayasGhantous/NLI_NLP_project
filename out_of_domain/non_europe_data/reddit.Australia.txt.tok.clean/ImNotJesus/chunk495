  unfortunately , we 're also still human beings . 
  hi thesecondasfarce , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4ikhfd/another_study_finds_link_between_pharma_money_and/ ) . 
  please remember that anecdotes , jokes and off-topic comments will be removed . 
  we are a science subreddit , please keep your comments based on the science and not your personal opinions as per our [ comment rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ), 
  it 's also worth pointing out that comments like `` durr '' or `` we needed a study for that '' are n't just not useful , they also betray significant ignorance . 
  firstly , even if something seems logical , we do n't just assume things to be true in science . 
  if we did that , it would just be our opinion and not something empirically tested . 
  second , lots of things we ** assume ** to be true actually are n't . 
  if we just assumed the world worked the way we thought it did , we would never know where are wrong . 
  finally , research shows that people often respond to psychology findings by believing that they already knew those results ( even when they 're made up ! ) . 
  this is because psychology feels much more intuitive to us than other sciences . 
  no one believes they intuitively understand what a proton is but most feel like they understand themselves or those around them - [ link to the full paper ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/charles_bond3/publication/247745091_that's_completely_obvious..._and_important_lay_judgments_of_social_psychological_findings/links/5534e4810cf2ea51c13353a5.pdf ) . 
  while asking about directionality can be a useful question , they pretty explicitly tested a specific direction . 
  if you [ read the abstract ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12120/abstract;jsessionid=4379616da8a775c1690c0f3346482168.f04t02?systemmessage=wiley+online+library+will+be+unavailable+on+saturday+14th+may+11%3a00-14%3a00+bst+%2f+06%3a00-09%3a00+edt+%2f+18%3a00-21%3a00+sgt+for+essential+maintenance.apologies+for+the+inconvenience . ), 
  it shows that they tested the effect of storytelling * on * attractiveness rating . 
   study 3 suggested that the effect of storytelling ability on long-term attractiveness for male targets may be mediated by perceived status . 
  this is perhaps the really key part of the finding . 
  when you look at the bivariate ( between two variables ) relation between storytelling ability and long-term attractiveness , the relationship is significant and of moderate strength . 
  that relationship is * no longer significant * when you account for the change in social status . 
  this ** possibly ** means that it works like this : being good at storytelling --  perception of high status --  perceived as attractive . 
  [ here is a visual representation from the paper ] ( https://i.imgur.com/f2gvmrg.png ), 
   with all due respect to your profession, 
  that 's never good . 
   many published psychology studies in recent years have been debunked for their bad science . 
  there 's a big difference between failing to replicate and being debunked . 
  i recommend reading this post from the other day - [ link ] ( http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/failure-is-moving-science-forward/?ex_cid=538fb ) . 
   i wonder if these studies hide behind paywalls because they know their process is flawed . 
  paywalls are common in basically every field of science . 
  the papers still go through rigorous peer-review by actual experts and everyone who is likely to be able to `` debunk '' or refute a paper appropriately has access to journals . 
  you 're assuming that failures to replicate are n't just because doing science is really hard but because people are maliciously doing bad work - that 's a really bold claim . 
   and the fewer people that read beyond the abstract , the more likely the authors will get to keep this notch in their belt . 
  while scientists certainly care about esteem , overwhelmingly they care about the esteem of their peers , not the public . 
  unless you 're posing some hidden agreement where all psychologists decide to do poor quality work and then never call each other out on it , the idea just does n't at all hold . 
  remember that science is a competitive field , i get ahead in my career by doing better work than you . 
   it may be just an indirect factor . 
  perhaps not an indirect factor as much as a signal * of * high status . 
  there may be cues involved in good storytelling ( confidence , intelligence , humour etc. ), 
  that indicate high status which then leads to perceived attractiveness . 
  that fits quite neatly with [ their findings ] ( https://i.imgur.com/f2gvmrg.png ), 
  oh there are definitely issues that need to be talked about but you wo n't find a group readier to do that than those in the field . 
  this issue is n't one that affects psychology alone , psychology are just doing the best work right now at self-policing . 
  it 's also not a new problem or one * only * identified by psychology . 
  only 3 years ago there were articles about the [ `` replicability crisis in cancer research '' ] ( http://www.scilogs.com/next_regeneration/the-replicability-crisis-in-cancer-research/ ) . 
  criticising psychology for doing science the way it should be ( with rigorous replication testing ) is like yelling at your child because they rechecked their homework and found a mistake . 
  or even the abstract in this case . 
  yes . 
  214 is a large enough sample for most things . 
  good question and possible way to follow up the study . 
  yes , by every major university and journal in the world . 
  the ideas are related but not necessarily the same thing . 
  one can be charismatic but not a good story teller or a good story teller but not charismatic . 
  i 'm sure charisma helps story telling in general though . 
  that 's definitely possible and something we could empirically test . 
  almost certainly . 
  exactly , hard to be on your high horse when you make most of your money from selling vitamins that virtually no one needs . 
  the vast majority of rapes are perpetrated by men . 
  do you think it 's more appropriate to use `` one-at-a-time thinking '' or should we assume that there 's something intrinsically wrong with men that makes them rapists ? 
  and virtually all of the same are in the bible . 
  hi herrerausagre , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  the referenced research is more than 6 months old .

  my point is that it 's silly to ** only ** consider it an issue of the religion itself since we know from very recent history that terrorism can happen in any religion . 
  hell , look up buddhist extremism , you may be surprised . 
  i did n't say otherwise ... 
   6 if your very own brother , or your son or daughter , or the wife you love , or your closest friend secretly entices you , saying , `` let us go and worship other gods '' ( gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known , 7 gods of the peoples around you , whether near or far , from one end of the land to the other ) , 8 do not yield to them or listen to them . 
  show them no pity . 
  do not spare them or shield them . 
  9 you must certainly put them to death . 
  your hand must be the first in putting them to death , and then the hands of all the people . 
  10 stone them to death , because they tried to turn you away from the lord your god , who brought you out of egypt , out of the land of slavery . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+13%3a6-10 ), 
   2 if a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the lord your god in violation of his covenant , 3 and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods , bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky , 4 and this has been brought to your attention , then you must investigate it thoroughly . 
  if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in israel , 5 take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+17%3a2-5 ), 
  even if we ignore that jesus specifically stated that `` not a jot or a tittle '' should be changed , there are plenty of acts of barbarism in the new testament . 
  either way , i never said that all ideas are equally bad . 
  clearly there are lots of bad ideas in the quran . 
  all i 'm saying is that making this issue ** primarily ** about the ** type ** of religion instead of the sociopolitical climate that allows religion to have this sort of power is missing the point of the issue . 
  we know from very recent history , and all over the world , that it does n't take islam to create terrorists . 
  [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhism_and_violence ) . 
   the left does n't believe that brown people do things fire the reasons they say . 
  i mean that was literally the first thing i said . 
  iq scores are [ literally going up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flynn_effect ) . 
  we also live in , by all objective measures , the best world that has ever existed . 
  in no time in human history have people been safer or had better access to education/care/medicine . 
  the world is getting better , the fact that you do n't personally like the kardashians does n't mean the world is going to shit , it just means that you have no fucking perspective on how bad things used to be only like a few decades ago . 
  hi avogadros_number , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it is a repost of an already submitted and popular story . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4jagla/misperceiving_bullshit_as_profound_is_associated/ ) . 
   44 people is even questionable . 
  it 's literally not and `` as a grad student , you should know better '' . 
  you also need to consider that it 's actually unethical to run human trials with more subjects than you need since you have an ethical duty to reduce harm . 
  since all trials have potential risks , getting a sample that is much bigger than you need just to satisfy someone on an internet forum that does n't understand power is not really the right thing to do . 
  sample size is relative and depends on the type of research you are conducting , how big the effects are and how you plan to analyse your data . 
  if you have lots of groups of people , with small differences between groups and really complicated analyses you need a huge sample . 
  if you 're comparing two quite similar groups , the sample can be much lower . 
  you can do what we call a `` power analysis '' , which the authors did . 
  this tells you what sample size you need to have enough power to find the result .
