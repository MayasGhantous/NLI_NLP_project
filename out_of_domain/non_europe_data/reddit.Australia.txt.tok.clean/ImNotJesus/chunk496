  please remember that anecdotes , jokes and off-topic comments will be removed . 
  we are a science subreddit , please keep your comments based on the science and not your personal opinions as per our [ comment rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ), 
  it 's also worth pointing out that comments like `` durr '' or `` we needed a study for that '' are n't just not useful , they also betray significant ignorance . 
  firstly , even if something seems logical , we do n't just assume things to be true in science . 
  if we did that , it would just be our opinion and not something empirically tested . 
  second , lots of things we ** assume ** to be true actually are n't . 
  if we just assumed the world worked the way we thought it did , we would never know where are wrong . 
  finally , research shows that people often respond to psychology findings by believing that they already knew those results ( even when they 're made up ! ) . 
  this is because psychology feels much more intuitive to us than other sciences . 
  no one believes they intuitively understand what a proton is but most feel like they understand themselves or those around them - [ link to the full paper ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/charles_bond3/publication/247745091_that's_completely_obvious..._and_important_lay_judgments_of_social_psychological_findings/links/5534e4810cf2ea51c13353a5.pdf ) . 
  who do i tell if a mod has been harassing me ? 
  i 'm so sick of these mods having their own rules that they live by but expect us to do differently . 
  i do n't want to say that they 're like nazis but if the ss uniform fits . . 
  that costs extra, 
  how do i get there from your momma 's house ? 
  then what happened ? 
  objection , hearsay . 
  did you become a mod because you love ruining other people 's day or because you hate freedom ? 
  sure . 
  you probably just added that . 
  typical ...

   would n't `` all genetically modified crops are safe '' count as a sweeping generalization ? 
  remember that genetic modification is a method , not an outcome . 
  it would be bad to say that `` all gm products are safe '' because the method could be used to make unsafe products . 
  in the same way that planes are really , really safe unless you use them wrong . 
  what they can say is that in the current state of gm products , they are overwhelmingly safe , effective and well tested . 
  importantly , because this is descriptive data ( describing the world as it is instead of manipulating variables ) it is impossible to determine the direction of this effect . 
  it is possible that ( a ) using social media causes depression , ( b ) having depression causes people to use social media more , ( c ) both depression and social media use are caused by other , unmeasured variables or ( d ) some combination of a , b and c. 
  while it 's unsatisfying to not be able to make bold claims about causal mechanisms , this sort of descriptive research is an important * first step * in discussing complex phenomena .
