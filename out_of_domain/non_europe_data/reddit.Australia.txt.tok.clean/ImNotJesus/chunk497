  hi dave , thanks for doing this ama . 
  in my somewhat limited exposure to political psychology , i have found myself very frustrated at the incredible amount of research that assumes liberal views as normative . 
  obviously , academics are overwhelmingly liberal ( including myself ) but my concern is that this treatment of conservative views as `` other '' may be introducing bias into the discourse and leading to certain views being ignored . 
  do you believe this to be a problem and if so , how should it be addressed ? 
   that is , they do n't think their ideas are the norm , they just think they are better . 
  this might be a terminology confusion here . 
  by normative i mean that liberal views are seen as the ` normal way to be ' where deviations from that are treated as interesting . 
  a prominent example would be the work of john jost who created a whole theory around why conservatives become conservative called system justification theory where he basically tries to predict why someone would be conservative . 
  the entire model is based on finding traits ( generally negative ones ) that predict conservatism . 
  inherent in that view is that the homeostatic position is liberal . 
  woah grats rb . 
  i 'm super jealous . 
  why ?

  ( ignoring that you did n't read the article anyway ), 
  well , what pediatricians do is they specialise in taking caring of children . 
  they do this not because they ** hate ** adults but because specialising in a specific area allows you to better understand and care for the ** specific needs of that group ** . 
  the `` all live matter '' or `` why not call yourself an egalitarian '' arguments are silly because there are fundamental differences in the struggles of each group . 
  having someone who specifically understands the needs of the lgbti community working with them , simply makes it easier for them to become better at it . 
  it does n't mean that they do n't care about heterosexual or cis people , it just means that they want someone to be an expert on that specific thing . 
  edit : just saw your edit to add the second question and i 'm hoping you 're just being obtuse . 
  either way , i 'll leave my sincere answer up . 
  when they had a different leader . 
  also , while their policy was shameful , i feel that we should be in the business of congratulating parties that evolve on issues . 
  mexican people ca n't be racist ? 
  they ca n't both be pandering . 
  either they were really pro-equality before and pandering to the conservative base or they 're not really pro-equality and pandering now . 
  you ca n't have your pander and eat it too ( or something ), 
  hey everyone ,, 
  this is just a friendly reminder that discussion of some of these harrowing problems can be really difficult for those who are going through a tough time and may bring up some scary feelings . 
  if you are feeling like you are not coping , please know that there are resources out there available to you . 
  there are [ crisis services worldwide ] ( https://www.iasp.info/resources/crisis_centres/ ) that are trained to provide support . 
  these centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems , can help you get through a tough hour/night/week . 
  otherwise , if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope , i strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area . 
  while it is * common * to experience periods of mental illness , that does n't make your experience normal or inevitable . 
  just as you would see a doctor when you are sick , you deserve to take care of your mental health . 
  stay safe people . 
  it 's almost like past actions and moral character count for something . 
  if i said that your mum kicked a puppy would you be as likely to believe it as if i said that some person you despise did ? 
  have you ever spoken to someone about it ? 
  it may be possible to help lessen those anxieties .
