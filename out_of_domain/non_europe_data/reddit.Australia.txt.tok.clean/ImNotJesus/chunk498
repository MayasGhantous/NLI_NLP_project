   `` today we 're going to apologise on behalf of parliaments and governments past for the laws we made , the lives we wrecked . 
  it 'll be the first full and formal apology of its kind anywhere in the world . 
  and it wo n't make things right , but it 's the right thing to do , because in our state , equality is not negotiable . '', 
  i do n't have words for how inspiring this man is . 
  also worth pointing out that matthew guy , the opposition leader , has also presented a great speech in support of this apology . 
  [ full speech now available ] ( http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/apology-to-those-convicted-under-unjust-laws-against-homosexual-acts/ ), 
  on the use of pesticides ; what do you think effect of the trend towards `` organic '' produce is ? 
  are the `` natural '' pesticides used any better for consumers or is it leading to heavier use and/or less regulated products ?

   after answering a list of questions testing objective knowledge of gm food , subjective , self-reported knowledge declines somewhat and beliefs about gm food safety increase slightly . 
  results suggest that consumers think they know more than they actually do about gm food , and queries about gm facts cause respondents to reassess how much they know . 
  very interesting .

  hawkeye is very underrated for aq/aw because his l1 lets you control power without baiting specials . 
  unless you 're playing the highest tier aw your bleed should out-tick willpower at 4/40 in most cases . 
  ( massive oversimplification coming ), 
  you seem be confused about the difference between [ sex and gender ] ( http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html ) . 
  one 's sex is about whether they have xx or xy sex chromosomes , one 's gender is about masculinity versus femininity . 
   then the concept of gender by that definition is nonscientific, 
  in what way is it not scientific ? 
  we do n't remove studies based on personal beliefs . 
  if it 's published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and the title/summary are unbiased , we would absolutely let that paper stay up . 
  your situation would n't happen for a large number of reasons however . 
   is there a science sub you can suggest that is less interested in identity politics and the censorship that often follows , and more interested in hypothesis , exploration , and truth ? 
  y' know , ` science ' . 
  i believe / r/scienceuncensored was set up for that reason btu you 're welcome to make another . 
  however , this is a question of science as much as protons are . 
  the fact that debates around trans rights are often politicised does n't change that . 
  we remove bigotry in this sub and transphobia applies . 
   for those members of the / r/science community who believe that transgender is a mental illness more than anything , what space are they given here , again in the scientific spirit , to discuss this ? 
  none . 
  we 've long held that we wo n't host discussion of anti-science topics without the use of peer-reviewed evidence . 
  opposing the classification of being transgender as not a mental illness is treated the same way as if you wanted to make anti-vax , anti-global warming or anti-gravity comments . 
  to be clear , the `` scientific spirit '' is using empirical evidence and theory to guide knowledge based on debate ** academic journals ** . 
  yelling at each other in a comments section of a forum is in no way `` scientific discussion '' . 
  if you wish to act in the `` scientific spirit '' i encourage you to do the work and publish something on the topic . 
  until then , your opinions are just that - opinions . 
  this is true but i thought i 'd start simple . 
   there is no room in science for feelings . 
  there 's no `` stance '' to take . 
  that 's the irony here . 
  our stance is that irrespective of the personal feelings of bigoted users , we will not treat that anti-science positions that being trans is a mental illness or some how not `` real '' in the same way that we would opposition to vaccines or gravity . 
  this is a science subreddit and the science is clear . 
  your personal feelings about whether or not it 's `` okay '' or `` real '' does n't actually make a difference . 
  the questions being removed certainly are n't innocent . 
   the apa believes it 's a mental illness . 
  citation required, 
   so / r/science , is this stance based upon scientific evidence or a reflection of the moderators feelings ? 
  whether or not it is a mental illness is a scientific question , not a moral stance , and therefore up for debate . 
  it 's up for debate ** in the science ** . 
  it 's not `` up for debate '' in a scientific forum where we allow on-topic debate about science . 
  it is the stance of every relevant body that it 's not a mental illness and thus we conform to that . 
  if the evidence changes , our stance will change too . 
  absolutely . 
   isnt it defined as a mental illness where the best treatment is transitioning ? 
  it 's not considered a mental illness . 
  he speaks on behalf of the whole team . 
   i honestly have no idea what that means . 
  are you saying that this sub is intended only to enforce the current thoughts on a given subject and disallows any debate to the contrary ? 
  to some extent , yes . 
  the current scientific consensus is that global warming is real . 
  you are welcome to * discuss * global warming but simply stating that global warming is n't real without evidence to show that , your comments are anti-science and worthy of removal . 
  it is , in fact , just your opinion . 
  the science continues in global warming however and it 's still `` up for debate '' in the literature . 
   ok , fine , but when did i ever suggest that ? 
  i have said over and over that reasoned and factual debate on any subject should be allowed, 
  we certainly allow reasoned and factual debate . 
  the standard is just higher when you 're opposing well established science . 
  ama tomorrow ( as per the bottom of the sticky ) . 
  we want to be very , very clear about what we will tolerate so no one can claim ignorance . 
  to the extent that the opinions of individual transgender people do n't change the science . 
  that being said , we are still a forum and we expect our users to act towards others with respect and decency .
