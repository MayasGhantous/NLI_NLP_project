  to clarify , we are ** not banning the discussion of any individual topic ** nor are we ** saying that the science in any area is settled ** . 
  what we are saying is that we stand with the rest of the scientific community and every relevant psych organisation that the overwhelming bulk of evidence is that being trans is ** not ** a mental illness and that the discussion of trans people as somehow `` sick '' or `` broken '' is offensive and bigoted ^ 1 . 
  we wo n't stand for it . 
  we 've long held that we wo n't host discussion of anti-science topics without the use of peer-reviewed evidence . 
  opposing the classification of being transgender as ` not a mental illness ' ^ 2 is treated the same way as if you wanted to make anti-vax , anti-global warming or anti-gravity comments . 
  to be clear , this post is to make it abundantly clear ** that we treat transphobic comments the same way we treat racist , sexist and homophobic comments ** . 
  they have no place on our board . 
  to be clear , scientific discussion is the use of empirical evidence and theory to guide knowledge based on debate in ** academic journals ** . 
  yelling at each other in a comments section of a forum is in no way `` scientific discussion '' . 
  if you wish to say that any well accepted scientific position is wrong , i encourage you to do the work and publish something on the topic . 
  until then , your opinions are just that - opinions . 
  ^ 1 some have wrongly interpreted this statement as `` stigmatizing '' mental illness . 
  as someone who both has devoted his life to psychology and had a mental illness , i can assure you that is the last thing we are trying to do here . 
  what we are trying to stop is the label of `` mental illness '' being used as a way to derogate a group . 
  it 's being used maliciously to say that there is ** something wrong ** with trans people and that 's offensive both to mental illness sufferers and those in the trans community . 
  ^ 2 there is a difference between being trans and having gender dysphoria . 
  [ since there are a lot of questions about it , here is the excerpt from the apa ] ( http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx ) :, 
   a psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability . 
  many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling , which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder . 
  for these individuals , the significant problem is finding affordable resources , such as counseling , hormone therapy , medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination . 
  many other obstacles may lead to distress , including a lack of acceptance within society , direct or indirect experiences with discrimination , or assault . 
  these experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety , depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons . 
   according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) , people who experience intense , persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of `` gender dysphoria . '', 
  some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated . 
  others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care . 
  the international classification of diseases ( icd ) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as `` gender identity disorder . '', 
   but gender dysphoria is still considered one , right ? 
  it 's as much a mental illness as depression . 
  or are we going to split hairs and say it is just something that is normal but causes depression ? 
  right . 
  so being a transgender person makes you obviously more likely to suffer from gender dysphoria but that does n't mean that they 're the same thing . 
  you 're ** more likely ** to suffer from depression and anxiety if you 're neurotic or introverted but that does n't mean that neuroticism or introversion are , in and of themselves , mental illnesses . 
   is it ` he ' or ` she ' ? 
  who are you referring to ? 
   nor are we saying that the science in any area is settled . 
  reread what i what . 
   there you go , mental health issues . 
  up to 18 % suicide rates after gender reassignment . 
  what 's your point ? 
  rates of depression and anxiety are higher in people who are more neurotic . 
  is neuroticism a mental illness ? 
  yes and if we were talking about gender dysphoria that would be a relevant link . 
   furthermore , the statement that mental illness is `` derogatory '' or `` hate speech '' , works to further undo efforts to normalize the discussion of mental illness , and polarizes discussion . 
  that 's really not a fair take on what we have said . 
  calling otherwise healthy people mentally ill ** as a weapon ** only serves to stigmatise mental illness and members of that group . 
  as someone who both has devoted his life to psychology and had a mental illness , i can assure you that is the last thing we are trying to do here . 
  what we are trying to stop is the label of `` mental illness '' being used as a way to derogate a group . 
  it 's being used maliciously to say that there is ** something wrong ** with trans people and that 's offensive both to mental illness sufferers and those in the trans community . 
  the issue comes when the label of mental illness is used as a weapon . 
  it demonizes both sufferers of mental illness and trans people and is not okay . 
  right and we continue to study and try to understand the nuance of gravity but we 'll almost certainly never overthrow the idea of gravity completely .

  i 'm cisgendered too so if someone wants to correct me please go for it but from my understanding , it 's generally best to refer to people by whatever they identify as unless they 've told you otherwise . 
  so if they 're genetically female but identify male , you would use he and him . 
  that being said , from my experience , most trans people are very happy to tell you what they prefer if you ask genuinely .

  hey guys , thanks for taking the time to do this ama . 
  we hear a lot about thyroid conditions being linked to obesity in some cases . 
  what i 'm wondering is whether there is much natural variation in thyroid function such that it may be * harder * for some people that others to lose without it necessarily being a diagnostic concern . 
  is there natural variation in how well thyroids function ? 
  does that natural variation impact weight management ?

  can we just pretend for one fucking second that the people in detention are ** actual fucking people ** and stop trying to score political points . 
  take a drink, 
  how can you be xenophobic when refugees are n't real people ? 
  turnbull saying that the people smugglers are advertising that `` it 's back on '' if labor wins is possibly one of the single most disgusting tactics i have ever seen in my life . 
  how fucking dare you turnbull , how can you treat the lives of human fucking beings as pawns to scare the public into voting for you .

   whereas politicians are unbiased , apolitical , scientifically-literate long-term thinkers who are trusted and respected by the australian public with a proven track record of international innovation and a source of national pride ? 
  that 's the point - scientists work from the basis that everyone is biased and the best work is down with as few assumptions and a priori decisions as possible .
