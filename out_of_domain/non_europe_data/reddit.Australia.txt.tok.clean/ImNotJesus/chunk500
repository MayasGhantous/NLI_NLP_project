   `` would n't it be a much more useful allocation of taxpayers ' money and research capacity within csiro to allocate its resources to an area where the science is n't settled ? '', 
  i really hope he was being disingenuous . 
  the science is settled that climate change is real - there 's still a hell of a lot we do n't understand about it that could potentially , you know , save the fucking planet .

  it 's literally not . 
  what are you arguing though ? 
  let 's say it 's 1 in 15 instead . 
  assume that all error is in a specific direction despite a huge literature showing that sex crimes are horribly underreported . 
  does that figure ** meaningfully ** change the results ? 
   i 'm not arguing anything i 'm questioning the data like a critical thinker should when presented with new information . 
  right , i 'm not saying that you should n't question the data . 
  what i 'm saying is that your critique is unlikely to have a ** meaningful ** impact on the results . 
  there are likely reporting biases in both directions ( some false positive and some false negative ) but i would n't expect the difference to be drastically different from the result they found unless you have evidence that a large number of people misreported . 
  there 's nuance involved in critiquing research . 
  so far your evidence for people misreporting is your own personal opinion and one much smaller study . 
  the actual paper that site talked about is also a self-report so has the same biases you 're concerned about . 
  with their smaller sample ( which is very relevant with something that is n't so common ) , 1 in 19 of their participants had their drinks spiked . 
  note that 1 in 19 includes ** both men and women ** . 
  when you account for gender differences the number is probably very close to 13 . 
  there is noise in all data and any study is an * approximation * of the world . 
  i 'm sure the exact number is n't 13 but , again , i do n't think there 's really a meaningful difference if the `` true '' value is slightly higher . 
  i have no agenda here - two different psychologists are telling you that your criticism is off the mark here but instead of trying to learn something you 're accusing me of having an agenda . 
  are you ** really ** thinking critically or are you trying to find evidence that supports your already held views ? 
  genuinely , have you stopped for a moment to try to see whether you might be wrong ? 
  i never said they were the same . 
  i 'm saying that given that victims of sex crimes under-report for all sorts of reasons , it 's not unrealistic to assume that drink spiking , which you yourself have linked to societal beliefs around sexual assault , is also * somewhat * under-reported . 
  it 's just an example of why there would be biases in both directions .

  please remember that anecdotes , jokes and off-topic comments will be removed . 
  we are a science subreddit , please keep your comments based on the science and not your personal opinions as per our [ comment rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ) . 
  there are already some good questions and comments here , let 's not hide them with low effort content . 
  edit : to clarify , we do n't ban low effort content because we hate fun or think that humour is antithetical to science , we do it because low effort content is low effort . 
  the rate at which people can post their opinions and stories massively outpaces the much small number of higher quality comments we get . 
  high quality comments take time to write and , in big posts , are often hidden by jokes and stories that provide mass appeal . 
  to be frank , our aim is to make the sub ** as educational as possible ** . 
  if your aim is jokes and personal anecdotes , there are places all over reddit to find them . 
  this is a science subreddit , not a that guy 's opinion subreddit . 
  asking questions is fine as long as they 're reasonable and not loaded . 
  no that 's entirely reasonable . 
  loaded means a question that does n't pressupose certain truths . 
  `` why is the government so corrupt ? '', 
  is loaded because it implies the government is corrupt but that 's a specific statement of fact that requires evidence . 
  hi verdunkeln , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

   i 've yet to hear a compelling argument against it except for the cost . 
  there 's also no real positive evidence that it 'll work though right ? 
  i like the idea of it but it 's basically just an unknown how everything would happen . 
  is n't that ** exactly ** what a top mod currently is ? 
  even if it 's the best one ever . 
  for questing , cage , for arena , yj . 
  wolvie is a beast . 
  awesome for questing and aq . 
  pretty equal - use whichever has synergies . 
  always focus more on your 4 * s. mk is your strongest . 
  that 's not a `` deconstructed '' latte . 
  it seems like what they 're trying to do is allow people to make their coffee to their own taste , adding as much milk or water as they like . 
  a deconstructed drink would mean that you are expected to drink all three parts separately which i doubt is the case . 
  this is wanky but it 's not ` drink a beaker of boiled water ' wanky . 
  biodynamic means something different to free range . 
  it 's basically an even more wanky version of organic ( somehow it 's actually possible ) . 
  it 's just a marketing gimmick . 
  yeah , you think there would be a mug to pour them into . 
  or have the coffee shot in a mug and the others in beakers or something . 
  it 's also quite a large amount of coffee so maybe it 's like when they bring you a whole teapot and you make a few cups ? 
  the irony of ordering something just to take a picture of it for social media and complain about hipsters . 
  it seems like science communication is largely a struggle to balance three factors : accuracy , digestibility for a lay audience and actually getting people to read it . 
  do you think it 's possible to balance those three factors ? 
  how do we appeal to consumers of science news without destroying the integrity of science ? 
  oh i 'm not having a go at you , just being pedantic . 
  what 's the point of the internet if not to try and make yourself seem smart to anonymous strangers for imaginary rewards ? 
  reminds me of this [ xkcd ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/atheists.png ),

  for questing , he 's very strong because he has massive physical resist and high stats ( do n't know them off the top of my head ) . 
  much higher hp than spidey . 
  he also has a stackable debuff ( which makes him terrible for aw and arena ) that helps reduce damage taken and the ability to stun . 
  he does n't clear content quickly but he does n't take much damage . 
   it seems to help , the link between religiosity and charitable giving is well-studied . 
  it certainly is .
