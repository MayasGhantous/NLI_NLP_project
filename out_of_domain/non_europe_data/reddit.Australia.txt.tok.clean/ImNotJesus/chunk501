  do you know what those studies find or do you just like making vague statements that sound authoritative with no evidence to back it up ? 
  spoiler alert : there 's a huge amount of literature and it 's still unclear whether there 's a difference . 
  to what extent is global warming affecting the number and intensity of hurricanes ? 
  are we likely to see more on the coming years as our climate warms ? 
  bonus question : do you think we should be giving hurricanes male names to [ reduce the associated death toll ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8782.abstract ) ? 
  [ huge meta-analysis on it from 4 years ago ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/138/5/876/ ) . 
  answer : it 's complicated but probably not . 
  do you think there are any potential futures uses for this research ? 
  for example , could this help to create more rain in drought affected areas ? 
   the link between charity and religion is totally undeniable ( except by people like you who are blind to facts ) . 
  i have read the paper . 
  in full . 
  twice . 
  well done though , you disingenuously read the introduction where the premise for the paper is laid out and ignored the conclusion of the paper . 
  if you look at sociological data , it does * appear * that religious people , on average , give more money to charity . 
  the whole point of that paper was to say that the relationship may be ( a ) illusory and ( b ) driven by prosocial behaviour ** only towards members of the ingroup ** ( and by the way , more aggressive behaviour towards outgroup members ) . 
  either you read that entire 30 page , dense , systematic review in less than 20 minutes and did n't understand it at all or you skimmed the first few paragraphs for something that agreed with your already held beliefs and copy-pasted it . 
  in either case , calling anyone who ** agrees with a large systematic review published in one of the best psychology journals int he world ** `` blind to facts '' when you acted like that is beyond ironic . 
  but hey , definitely complain more about people downvoting facts . 
  please tell me more that i 'm misrepresenting a paper ** that you have n't read ** based on concepts that you are misusing and clearly do n't understand . 
  yes , your original statement was in the context of a claim that religious people * give more * . 
  that ** is n't necessarily true ** . 
  as i 've said several times , if you actually read the paper instead of just constantly stating what you imagine it says , you may learn something . 
  either way , i 'm done arguing with you because you clearly have no desire to engage in a genuine discussion and just keep stating your already held beliefs . 
  hi erniepotts , your post has been removed because :,

  please contact the mods if you need further assistance, 
  i mean , when you 'd rather have them in literal concentration camps than help them out , it does kind of suggest a lack of caring . 
  what 's your favourite ali gif or video ? 
  [ dodging 21 punches in 10 seconds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrzwzn5.gif ), 
  also that the research overwhelmingly shows that refugees are a net positive to a country 's economy . 
  that , and you know , remembering that they 're human beings . 
   they 're not `` literal concentration camps '' you fucking idiot . 
  charming . 
   further , unless you support completely unrestrained immigration eventually you 'll need to lock people up , you 'll need to send them back - so unless you 're for completely open borders we 're just arguing numbers , not methods . 
  no middle ground exists . 
  it 's simply not possible to humanely treat refugees while processing them . 
  if you do n't personally support torturing refugees you have to agree to wanting every single refugee settled immediately . 
   i 'd question that research, 
  ahh the sign of good critical thinking . 
  assuming research is false purely because is disagrees with what you already believe . 
   they 're not literal concentration camps and making that claim is absolutely disgusting . 
  you should be ashamed of yourself for doing so , completely ashamed . 
  google it dingus . 
   i do n't agree with torturing refugees and i want them treated as humanely as possible . 
  at the same time , i do n't support open borders or encouraging people to make a dangerous journey to australia , so some of these people will need to be locked up , some of them will need to be sent back , some of them we will be unable to ascertain their identity with any sort of certainty and thus will have to wait a long time . 
  i do n't support er 's treating people who are in car accidents , it will only encourage other people to drive quickly . 
   the reality is that under the lnp you 've seen less children in detention , less people in detention , less people dying at sea while the refugee intake has been roughly steady or increasing . 
  yes because they changed the definitions . 
  also , since we 're getting pedantic about word choice , it 's ** fewer ** . 
   the sort of plan the left usually spouts in response to this is to just let anyone claiming asylum into australia after a very quick processing time . 
  that is de facto open borders and would lead to massive costs to australians . 
  it 's literally not . 
   another claim i often hear is that refugees are good for the economy - that our standard of living only increases with refugees . 
  if that is true ( i do n't think it is ) then why not support open borders ? 
  if 20,000 refugees a year are a net positive for the economy why wo n't 50,000 a year ? 
  100,000 a year ? 
  welfare is good for the economy but that does n't mean we should give everyone 40 million dollars . 
  eating carrots is good for you , that does n't mean you should 94 carrots a day . 
  it 's almost like , you know , normal rational adults can talk about things in reasonable ways instead of strawmanning what everyone else thinks . 
  now now , if we were allowing people in based on iq you 'd be gone already . 
  probably not a good criteria for you to be pushing . 
  because i do n't keep a current lit review on hand at all times . 
  i 've read several studies and un reports on the topic . 
  if he had asked me to find something i gladly would but simply stating you disagree with a finding based on nothing but your own personal opinion is the antithesis of critical thinking . 
  sure . 
  i 'm happy to control the flow . 
  there are all sorts of reasonable ways to control refugee influx that do n't involve torture . 
   i do n't know why the government treats refugees so poorly when they 're locked up . 
  but they are not torturing them . 
  perhaps not actively but the treatment is tantamount to torture . 
   and they are not putting them in concentration camps . 
  they literally are - http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/concentration%20camp, 
   full definition of concentration camp, 
   : a camp where persons ( as prisoners of war , political prisoners , or refugees ) are detained or confined, 
   treating people who may be unsure of the refugee issue with sarcasm and hostility is not going to help shift public opinion to where you believe it should be . 
  he had already responded to other comments of mine in a completely disingenuous ( and rude ) way . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  it might be lost because who i was replying to deleted their comment . 
   that 's the way it seems to me . 
  in fact , i would be surprised if iq was n't correlated with race to some extent . 
  spoiler alert : this bell curve bullshit you 're spreading has been widely disregarded for decades . 
  while genes are important for iq ( roughly 50/50 depending on which meta-analysis you read ) , there 's absolutely no evidence that any iq differences are better attributed to race than differences in environment . 
  simple things like the flynn effect basically stopping in developed countries while it continues to happen in less developed countries is one of many lines of evidence . 
  spend a little less time on the_donald a more time in the real world bud . 
  that seems like a logistical nightmare .

  the [ befrienders ] ( http://www.befrienders.org/ ) website is a global list of local suicide help charities . 
  use it to find an organisation in your country , you should be able to call or email them for free and they 'll speak to you and try and help you without being judgmental . 
  what makes qgj so good ? 
  his speed ? 
  right . 
  so sex is your sex chromosomes , gender is the social expectations of masculinity/femininity . 
   like , what 's the word for people who : eat meat do n't have cancer do n't have allergies can not play the piano . 
  by that logic heterosexual should n't be a word . 
   ` cis ' is doubly ridiculous if you 're claiming ` trans women are women ' .
