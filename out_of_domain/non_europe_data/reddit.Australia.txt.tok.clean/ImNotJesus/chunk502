  if they 're women then they 're cis women , or they 're not women . 
  women with red hair are still women , that does n't mean we 're not allowed to use the term red haired woman . 
  it seems like you have a very strong desire to find issue here, 
  the basic gist of this paper is that how parents talk about intelligence and failure matter . 
  there 's decades of research showing that if you praise intelligence over trying , it teaches the child that you 're either good or bad at things and there 's nothing you can do a bout it . 
  when you praise effort , they tend to persevere more . 
  ** in short , if children think intelligence is fixed , they see no reason to try ** . 
  what this study adds is saying is that these messages are n't being sent by parents views on intelligence but by their parents views on * failure * . 
  they find '' overall , parents who see failure as debilitating focus on their children 's performance and ability rather than on their children 's learning , and their children , in turn , tend to believe that intelligence is fixed rather than malleable . '',

  so the common misconception of this area of work is that you 're supposed to treat every goal as possible and achievable `` if you work hard enough '' . 
  it 's not necessarily about assuming that everything is achievable , it 's about teaching your child that ** the best way ** to increase your chances of attaining your goals is through effort . 
  growth mindset . 
  lots of research on it . 
  which , for the record , has no relationship to the bastardisation of it known as `` attachment parenting '' . 
  at least not the disgusting attachment parenting stuff i 've read . 
  carol dweck , the co-author on this paper and really the most prolific researcher in the area has a bunch of books on the topic . 
  hi grahamsantander , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  which would be meaningful if the entire article was n't incoherent nonsense . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm not saying there ** was n't ** fraud , i 'm just saying that this proves literally nothing . 
  the entire thing is based on massive assumptions that have no basis . 
   one can also search for trends to check for fraud . 
  one of the most revealing methods , the cumulative vote share analysis , searches for a correlation between the size of a discrepancy ( between recorded vote and exit polls ) and the size of a precinct . 
  when no fraud has taken place the trend tends to be quite regular . 
  to establish that , one would need a significant number of fraudulent primaries to use as a baseline measure . 
  the other assumption is that doing better in larger districts means she 's cheating somehow . 
  i have no idea how/why anyone would assume that other than wanting it to be true . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm not saying there ** was n't ** fraud , i 'm just saying that this proves literally nothing . 
  which would be meaningful if the analysis was n't entirely nonsensical . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm not saying there ** was n't ** fraud , i 'm just saying that this proves literally nothing . 
  just because you want to believe it 's true , does n't make it so . 
  i 've read it , i understand it , it 's based on impossible assumptions with no evidence to back them up . 
  i have taken many . 
  which part has merit and is n't based on assumptions with no empirical support ? 
  right but my point is that this is n't evidence - it 's some guy really wanting something to be true and making a whole heap of baseless assumptions to try to prove it . 
  but thanks for making a whole range of assumptions about what i think purely because i do n't accept shitty evidence that agrees with your personal view .

  i love that they could have used a picture of ** any ** product and chose one with a woman in a bikini . 
  what does her race have to do with anything ? 
  if you had no fraudulent elections to compare to , how could you possibly conclude that non-normal results are fraud and not some other cause ? 
  how can a human have anthropomorphic features ? 
  damn that human looks very humanlike . 
  superficially humanlike .

  why are n't you charging more now then ? 
  is n't this the * exact * opposite of protecting their own interests ? 
  instead of sticking it to the libs they 're giving their preferences to someone who is n't a guy from tv . 
  this is n't like playing wii at a party , it should n't be that anyone who wants to just gets a go . 
  as much as you hate tony ( and i really , really do ) we should n't be giving ministerial spots to people whose claim to fame is throwing to ad breaks in a singing competition . 
   edit : downvote brigading , noice . 
  it 's not some conspiracy , people just think you 're an idiot . 
  yeah , people realise you were being sarcastic , they 're just not impressed by the super edginess of your comment . 
  meanwhile , labor are proposing cutting [ $ 704 ** million ** worth of rebates to alternative medicine ] ( http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/06/10/labor-scraps-rebates-natural-therapies ) . 
  note for those who do n't bother to read articles , it 's $ 180 over 4 years , $ 704 million saved over 10 . 
  this comes in the wake of them increasing funding to hospitals and i know which i 'd rather my money go to . 
  i 'm sure there is also massive savings involved in people going to real doctors for medical conditions instead of fake ones . 
  the harm of seeking alternative medicine [ definitely is n't 0 ] ( http://whatstheharm.net/ ) and there are risks associated with ( a ) dangerous treatments and ( b ) delaying appropriate treatment . 
  these savings would be hard to quantify but someone 's cancer getting worse because they delayed chemotherapy to get acupuncture costs the public health system money . 
  also , obligatory tim minchin `` do you know what they call alternative medicine that 's been proved to work ? 
  medicine '' . 
  they can use their tears for homeopathic solutions . 
  dara 's is a bit different but same idea . 
   `` i 'm sorry , ` herbal medicine ' , `` oh , herbal medicine 's been around for thousands of years ! '', 
  indeed it has , and then we tested it all , and the stuff that worked became ` medicine ' . 
  and the rest of it is just a nice bowl of soup and some potpourri , so knock yourselves out . '', 
  i 'm sure neither are the first though . 
  i 'm just glad to see a reference to that movie that does n't make me want to punch the person . 
  yes . 
  very much so . 
  [ also potentially dangerous ] ( http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chiropractic-adjustment/basics/risks/prc-20013239 ), 
  i want to bully myself for saying this but technically it 's not actually a strawman . 
  a strawman would be if he presented a weak argument on labor 's behalf and then argued against it . 
  this would be closer to a red herring fallacy but depends on what his conclusions are . 
  at this point it 's just an irrelevant statement . 
  just ones that are sold in the guise of medicine i think . 
  yeah , even if you concede that acupuncture does work in some situations ( it does n't in studies with fake acupuncture ) medicine should be regulated by doctors , not people who pretend to be doctors . 
  i 've never seen a study that included fake acupuncture where it outperforms placebo . 
  really ? 
  i 'm liking sid !, 
  who should i aim for instead ? 
  i 'm f2p, 
  makes sense , thanks, 
  makes sense . 
  thanks, 
  thanks, 
  semi related , how important is it to have a healer in each unit ? 
  what about aiming for a droid team for my darkside ? 
  rey seems like she 'll take forever . 
  would hk , ig-88 , ig-86 , genosian + magnaguard be strong ? 
  i ca n't get grievous or b2 as f2p so i 'm not sure who else it would be .
