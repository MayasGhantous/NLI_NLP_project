  really ? 
  what makes him so good ? 
  very interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  is it okay if i come back with more questions later ? 
  han 's taunt ca n't be dispelled ? 
  sorry another question . 
  so i just got my gs to 4 * , should i keep using my cantina energy to promote it or use it somewhere else ? 
  i do n't see anyone worth farming until later one . 
  i could try to reach magnaguard but a few people said he was n't that great in this post . 
  makes sense . 
  thanks, 
  the problem i 'm having is that i have too many people to farm with arena shipments and gw rewards . 
  for gw i want lumi , 86 and poggle . 
  for arena i was hk and 88 ( people keep saying i need han as a tank too ) . 
  then in the cantina store i 'm getting qgj but unless i get another strong light character i ca n't see myself getting far enough in missions to get the gear i need so should i farm 5s as well ? 
  it just feels like it 'll take forever to get anyone to 7 with so many needs at once . 
  poe makes more sense for farming since he 's cantina instead of a 3rd arena . 
  that does take off a bit of pressure . 
  would a light team of poe , finn , rey , lumi , qgj be alright ? 
  ahh it 's tricky trying to plan out synergies when you do n't know who is shit yet . 
  who would be a good fifth with that team ? 
  another jedi ? 
  hmm i guess that makes sense . 
  not even worth getting old ben with my cantina energy ? 
  he seems like a pretty easy farm and quite strong . 
  spez it 's all well and good to ** say ** you oppose those things but what are you doing ? 
  there 's a very popular subreddit regularly brigading other subs and harassing mods and despite constant begging by default mods to do something the admins stay silent . 
  what 's more , in your last q&a your own response to a question was partially responsible for the harassment of a mod that left that mod needing to take a break from reddit . 
  as a default mod ( who has never personally been the victim of mass harassment ) , it seems like we hear ** a lot ** more about what you think than actually doing something . 
  when are you going to start taking the people who ** run your website for free ** seriously ? 
  do we need to blackout every time we need some fucking support ? 
  why would n't they ? 
  a gay person can be still perform a hate crime . 
  it does n't lessen the fact that these people were targeted as a result of their sexuality and thus victims of a hate crime .

  can we hurry up and legalise gay marriage so i can marry daniel andrews ? 
  you 're right , supporting marginalised groups publicly definitely does less than being a cynical ass on the internet . 
  you keep doing you pal, 
  but like one of those jokes on scrubs where you laugh at first and then feel really sad for a while . 
  not me . 
  must be someone else who also is n't jesus . 
  we 're narrowing it down . 
   you are literally and factually incorrect . 
  transgenderism ( gender identity disorder ) is classified as a mental illness , and has some pretty terrible consequences like a very high suicide rate . 
  that 's actually not true . 
  it was removed in the latest dsm because not all trans * people suffer from gender dysphoria - http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx, 
  the ship has sailed on that . 
  it would 've been an awesome idea 30 years ago but massively investing in renewables is ( a ) a better long term solution and ( b ) positions us to have a thriving industry for the new economy . 
  thank you so much for doing this ama and for all of your important work . 
  i find that when educating others about psychology , the hardest topics are always those where people have a sense that their brain works effectively ( e.g. , people are hesitant to believe they are biased etc. ) . 
  as most people assume their memories to be a recording of previous events and mostly reliable , how do we best educate society about the immense flaws in memories and the ramifications that has for criminal justice ? 
  obviously not the op but there have been people working on this for quite a while now , the most famous being elizabeth loftus . 
  as a starting point i recommend looking up the `` lost in the mall '' study . 
  because ( a ) it 's not easy to fire permanent staff and ( b ) there are time/money/skills issues with doing that . 
  relatively new ftp player , started fresh after getting to lvl 45 and now in the top few on my server ( against some serious whales ) so i really want to keep it that way . 
  so far , i 'm really determined to do a rebel team with aa ( l ) , leia , st han . 
  from there , i 'm really not sure how to go . 
  i think i want to bring in rey eventually ( happy to reconsider ) but i 'm not sure who to take in that 5th spot . 
  these are the options i 'm thinking through currently : luke , lumi , old ben , qgj , another tank ( rg ? ), 
  or even hoth rebel scout ( heard he 's pretty good with an aa lead ) . 
  totally open to any other suggestions too . 
  what would you guys do ? 
  i do n't really have any end game experience and need to make sure i 'm building to a really good combo since there are a few guys spending really big . 
  so i already have 3 * leia ( she was my starting character ) and am half way to st han . 
  i was worried about that same problem of all being from arena though . 
  should i forget about aa even though he 's so good with han and leia or just be patient ? 
  that makes a lot of sense . 
  finished 2 yesterday ( 4 the day before ) and those crystals are really nice . 
  i was planning to get lumi to help with gw anyway so i could just use her in my arena team until aa is ready and focus on han/leia ? 
  i 've also been working on daka with cantina shipments so that could be another option or is she terrible for arena ? 
  yeah i started working towards her because i 've already got a glut of strong ls characters to choose from but almost no ds . 
  i know it 's not worth focussing on the missions too heavily but you at least need some ds characters to finish enough missions to gear up . 
  if i do eventually end up with something like aa-leia-han-rey do you think luke is a usable 5th ? 
  it seems like it 's either him , gs or ben that i can farm with cantina energy and the synergy with aa lead is so , so strong . 
  from what i 've read , people say luke 's biggest weakness is his speed but he hits like a train when he crits . 
  if he 's getting crit from leia and speed from aa . . 
  is it actually necessary to allow voting on announcements ? 
  i was hesitant but really happy to start fresh in the end . 
  i made lots of mistakes first time ( restarted around level 50 ) so it was nice not being so wasteful and actually being able to compete .
