   this screams `` third variable '' to me, 
  well it 's longitudinal research so i 'm sure lots of variables are involved . 
  which particular variable do you think better explains this relationship and on what basis ? 
   i have n't read anything about a select few stressors 25 years in the past having any current effect ; i 'd like to know the mechanism they propose . 
  have you tried reading the article ? 
   what 's likely true is that men experiencing these stressors 25 years prior have different life trajectories than men who do n't experience these stressors . 
  why do you think this is true ? 
  what evidence do you have for that assertion ? 
  how would that actually change any of these results ? 
   in addition , we ca n't talk about `` effects '' of stress because the researchers did n't manipulate stress . 
  are you implying that no longitudinal research is valid even if it 's theoretically coherent and fits with other literature ? 
   i personally think this specific study is an example of that . 
  which part of the methodology do you think lacks in scientific rigor ? 
  i never said otherwise . 
  you have boldly claimed that this published and peer-reviewed piece of work is an example of a study that is `` less scientific '' . 
  i am curious to know what specific part of their methodology you think is `` less scientific '' and what that actually means as a concept . 
  by what criteria can you define something as more or less scientific ? 
  what do you mean by the way it is going to be used ? 
  how are the researchers responsible for how other interpret their research ?

  and then i can access the account on my phone ? 
  sorry , i 've never used bluestacks before so have no idea how it works . 
  download bluestacks on my pc or on my phone ? 
  thanks !,

  i know it 's not as much of a thing here but the pun is great . 
  have you been on the internet for less than 5 minutes ? 
  that 's the only bit i did n't get about your rant . 
  i thought the whole thing was hilarious but on what basis do you assume he 's an `` sjw '' instead of just some obnoxious and self-righteous twat ? 
  that could fit a lot of different obnoxious and self-righteous groups . 
  there are a lot of people in between `` sjws '' and right wing fascists . 
  many of which are really obnoxious . 
   green corrected a few things she said , there could have been a more knowledgeable host . 
  to be fair , green could correct almost anyone on election and constitutional matters . 
  the telecast was great except for scomo spending the whole time campaigning and no one letting penny speak . 
  her genuine contempt for scomo was pretty entertaining at the start but she did seem to ease after a while . 
  so edgy, 
  i think you might be talking about a caricature of toxic masculinity .

   it would be funny if he announced 3rd party run . 
  well , one can dream . 
  your dream is a trump presidency ? 
  except the ag had nothing to do with the fbi investigation or what comey said today . 
  he , once again , shows he has no idea of what 's actually going on around him . 
  to recap , on the day where hillary gets slammed by the fbi for her handling of emails and exposes that she was n't entirely truthful ( even if not criminally responsible ) , he responds by ( a ) calling the fbi and ag corrupt and ( b ) making a terrible gaffe that will draw all negative attention back on him . 
  this guy is definitely a savvy politician and not just some racist old guy rambling incoherently . 
  sorry , because of the title rules i ca n't add `` in victoria '' but hopefully the url is enough to tell people . 
  i 've seen aa , sth , hrs , lando and phasma before where phasma is used to help lando crit . 
  i could try move towards that but with leia instead of hrs . 
  rg seems so far away still since i ca n't even really farm him effectively and i 'm really like han as a tank . 
  is there any benefit to double tank or better to get qgj to help me with all of the rgs that these whales have at 7 * already ?
