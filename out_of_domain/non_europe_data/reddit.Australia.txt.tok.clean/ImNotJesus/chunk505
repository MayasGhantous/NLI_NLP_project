  i 'd be more than happy to help !, 
  the problem is that when you actually try to measure people as not on that continuum , the data ends up really messy . 
  there are some arguments that we should split things into 4 poles ( economic x social ) but you tend to only capture a few percent that are n't right/right or left/left . 
  [ the world is getting better all the time , in 11 maps and charts ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8908397/11-charts-best-time-in-history ) . 
  we 're ( a ) much more aware than we have ever been and ( b ) have much higher standards . 
  while these tragedies and civil wars are horrifying on a micro level , at a macro level ** a better world has never existed ** . 
  at no time in history have people been more safe , more equal , better educated , had better access to healthcare etc. 
  global warming is terrifying because ** we give a shit about global warming now ** . 
  coups in turkey are terrifying ** because we know what 's going on in other countries ** . 
  mass murder in nice is terrifying because ** it 's a rare event ** . 
  yes . 
  you should punish people for actions , not thought crimes . 
  for example , you believe in deporting people for their religious beliefs and i think that 's disgusting . 
  should ** you ** be deported for having those values ?

  yeah but at least now there 's money in the budget for corporate tax cuts . 
  all these lazy diabetics need to do is to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and sell some $ 6000 toasters . 
  yes but unfortunately it clearly does . 
  if women are 50 % of the population but are significantly less represented in the government that means there 's a * systematic * bias that is stopping them from being there . 
  if you accept as a premise that women are n't innately less capable , that means there must be an uneven playing field in some way . 
  i literally never said any of those things . 
  you said that gender , race and religion should n't matter but just wanting them to not matter does n't change the fact that certain groups already face disadvantages . 
  i 'm not telling you i have some perfect solution , i do n't think one exists . 
  but just wishing away the problem is significantly less useful than at least admitting one exists . 
  i mean , i know you 're joking but there is evidence to say that how women in power are treated does affect their desire to get into powerful positions . 
  what evidence do you have that the difference is desire ? 
  even if you did have that evidence , there 's actually quite a lot of research showing that the way women in power are treated * is * a deterrent for other women going for political positions . 
  so even if you could provide evidence of trait differences in desire , it would n't mean that there 's a non-systematic answer . 
  charming . 
  in what way do you think it would have an effect ? 
  i can think of many positive possibilities, 
  you do n't see any reason to think that women might face explicit or implicit bias against them when trying to go for jobs in power ? 
  it sounds like you might not have the most well rounded perspective of the differences in how other groups are treated pal . 
  that 's a great question !, 
  partly , probably . 
  although i think there are some specific challenges for going into powerful roles . 
  we certainly should encourage more women to get into traditionally male jobs just as we should encourage men to get into traditionally feminine jobs . 
  it really does n't seem like you know what some of those words mean so it 's better to avoid using them rather than looking silly . 
  in terms of statistics , a systematic bias is when something you are n't measuring explains a specific result . 
  so , by definition , if the gender ratio is n't 50/50 then there is some systematic difference that is changing the ratio . 
  if so , the implications are either that ( a ) they are less capable in some way or ( b ) there are societal factors making them less likely to be there/succeed . 
  no one said we should force women to become mechanics , just that we should look to see whether societal forces are affecting both genders in seeking out the best career for themselves . 
  right , no one is saying you should . 
  again , the premise is that if the representation is n't 50/50 then there must be some factor pushing men and women towards/away from certain jobs . 
  i 'm not saying we should push anyone to be something they do n't want to be , just that we should be making sure that society is n't doing that unknowingly . 
  you 're making a lot of assumptions about what my approach is . 
  i 've never once said that quotas or hiring shitty people is a good idea . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's not a good thing that there 's a gender gap . 
  do you not agree with that ? 
  why do you think men typically go for certain jobs more and women typically go for other jobs more ? 
  i 'm not saying individuals , i 'm just saying that the way a society is set up puts all sorts of pressures on individuals to act in different ways . 
  as a man , you 're given a whole series of messages about what it means to be mascline , women the same about being feminine . 
  those messages affect the way people think/feel/act . 
  i 'm not rearranging anything , i 'm actually just being consistent with what i 've said the whole time . 
  you just want to argue against a strawman which i refuse to be . 
  as i 've said in other comments , i do n't know * the * solution , i do n't think a perfect solution exists . 
  but , just because you do n't personally like one possible solution that does n't change the nature of the problem . 
  all i 'm talking about here is the nature of the problem , which , for the record , many people in this post disagree with . 
  except that , as i just said , multiple people in this thread are arguing with me purely about that premise . 
  if you do n't think equality is a worthwhile value there 's nothing i can do to convince you that you should care . 
  they could use your comments . 
   no thought crimes kids !, 
  do you not actually know what the word thought means or are you too busy jacking off to your copy of 1984 to think about what you 're saying for more than a fraction of a second ? 
  i dis ** d ** ain lots of things , that does n't mean that i think rights should be attributed on the basis of one 's belief system . 
  for example , i think people who make judgments of over 1 billion people on the basis of a statistically insignificant sample to be fuckwits but you do n't see me trying to deny you or sonya citizenship , do you ? 
  it 's almost like , and i know this sounds crazy , that we should judge people on their actions and not whether or not you personally like their thoughts . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  nothing justifies murder . 
  that being said , we can make sensible statements about what is more or less likely to lead to more violence . 
  for example , isis is n't ** justified ** but we can sure as shit say that the iraq war was terribly executed because it was responsible for helping to create that environment . 
  i do n't really get why he 's talking about depicting mohammad specifically however . 
   is there a guide to what we are and are n't entitled to have opinions on ? 
  things he agrees with are fine , things he does n't agree with are sjw thought crimes . 
  did you even listen ? 
  smug cynicism aside , anyone not desperate to do the exact thing he 's complaining about realises that circlejerking about the new outrage of the day does nothing but increase division . 
  group polarisation is a thing and it 's scary . 
  it 's also getting worse . 
  study after study is showing that . 
  so you can make your snide comments about hugging a terrorist or you can stop for a second and realise what social psychology has known for 60 years now , groups are really shitty . 
  the more you identify with one group , the shittier you are , the shittier you treat other groups and the shittier they treat you in return . 
  the worst part is that that only makes you identify with that group more , which makes you act shittier etc. 
   why fear radical islam, 
  because if you 're read a single history book you 'd know that what 's happening right now is n't new or exclusive to islam . 
  hell , read the wikipedia page on buddhist terrorism if you like . 
  if you swapped every muslim to christian and christian to muslim , the current issues would be fundamentally identical . 
  sure , beliefs matter but to blame islam is to miss the point entirely . 
  it 's true of all groups in all contexts . 
  ingroup-outgroup dynamics are so strong that even if you * show people that the groups are being randomly drawn out of a hat * , they 'll still instantly show bias towards their team and against the other team . 
  in terms of islam specifically , we need to remember that these people are literal outliers . 
  by definition , islam is n't ** causing ** them to be terrorists , even if we can say that it is having some impact . 
  the more we promote equality , welcoming of all groups and stop bombing the shit out of people in the middle of the desert while actively harming their ability to rebuild safely by mass firing teachers , killing local industry with raegonomics and disbanding local law , we 'll be able to cut the number drastically . 
  there are always going to be people who want to harm others but no happy and healthy person shoots other people . 
  yeah , no one has tried violently opposing other religions before .
