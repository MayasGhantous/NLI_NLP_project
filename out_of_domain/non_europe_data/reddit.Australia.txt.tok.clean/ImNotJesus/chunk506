  well obviously , i like my team because they 're the best but that 's the exception that proves the rule . 
  i never said beliefs do n't matter . 
  i certainly think that the world would be better off if people did n't follow ideologies like that but that does n't make it a cause . 
  just because drinking is involved in alcoholism it does n't mean that alcohol causes alcoholism . 
  there are no end to the ideologies people are willing to die for , blaming the current flavour misses the point . 
  i do n't think otherwise happy/healthy people with access to opportunity take meth . 
  smug cynicism aside , anyone not desperate to do the exact thing he 's complaining about realises that circlejerking about the new outrage of the day does nothing but increase division . 
  group polarisation is a thing and it 's scary . 
  it 's also getting worse . 
  study after study is showing that . 
  so you can make your snide comments about hugging a terrorist or you can stop for a second and realise what social psychology has known for 60 years now , groups are really shitty . 
  the more you identify with one group , the shittier you behave , the shittier you treat other groups and the shittier they treat you in return . 
  the worst part is that that only makes you identify with that group more , which makes you act shittier etc. 
  it 's really easy to be cynical but by doing so you 're doing the exact thing that he 's talking about . 
  social media should n't be about who can be contrary or outrageous the loudest . 
  it is , because that 's human nature , but that does n't mean we should n't strive to be better . 
  you do n't think a victim of * these * attacks calling for compassion instead of vitriol means anything ? 
  edited for clarity . 
  speaking generally about him being the victim of people constantly attacking him for the colour of his skin and belief system . 
  just look at the letter to the editor from the story , someone literally said that him and his family should be in prison just because they have the same religious belief as a handful of really , really , really evil people . 
  sonia is just one of the people he talked about . 
  if you actually watch/read it instead of just the headline you would know this . 
  we should ban men from getting married since they 're disproportionately likely to commit domestic violence . 
  you know what , almost all white collar crime is committed by white men , perhaps we should ban all white men from high level business roles . 
  * or * , you know , we could just not claim that an entire group is evil because of what are literally statistical outliers . 
  they 're really , really , scary outliers but the number of terrorists as a proportion of muslims is ** tiny ** . 
  far smaller than the proportion of men who have committed sex crimes . 
  keep doubling down buddy . 
   so sonia shares an opinion and waleed puts her and her comment into a basket with real bigots to make it seem worse than it was . 
  it would be like us putting `` all muslims '' into the basket containing terroists and saying there you go , you are all the same . 
  except that she said something really shitty . 
  lumping muslims in with other terrorists is blaming them for others in their group . 
  people are blaming her ** for what she said ** . 
  if she was being criticised because other white people had said shitty things i 'd agree with you . 
  she 's entitled to have her opinion , she 's just not immune from criticism just for having it . 
  she might not be ** as bad ** as some other people but , again , his entire point was to be compassionate towards her . 
  you would know this if you had watched it . 
   we know that is not the case , just like her comment is not the same as the other people he was talking about . 
  no one said it 's the same . 
  this is something you 're throwing in as you flounder to recover from clearly only having read the headline before you started vigorously jerking yourself off with smug indignation . 
   if you keep shutting down peoples opinions on this because it offends , then we are going to get nowhere . 
  no one is shutting her down . 
  she said something and people responded . 
  no one has silenced her , she 's facing the natural consequences of saying something shitty . 
  ** also , ** again , waleed is saying the exact opposite of what you 're accusing him of . 
  perhaps try digging up instead . 
  yes and i have no problem with efforts to stop that person . 
  but i should n't be put in jail because some other white guy is likely to commit a crime at some point . 
   islam is particularly divisive as the text has different rules for believers and non-believers . 
  so do christianity and judaism . 
  does n't matter ; felt self-righteous, 
  it 's literally not . 
  source : have a psychology degree , not an / r/atheism degree . 
  i 've noticed that every time that guy makes a comment it 's obscenely stupid . 
  only 2 data points so far but a correlation of 1 !, 
  do you think that you believe any incorrect things ? 
  every single thing you believe ? 
  and it 's all really high quality evidence right ? 
  for example , you would n't just have the * opinion * that religion is a mental illness without bothering to look up what the criteria for being classified as a mental illness right ? 
  you 'd probably have a really good answer for why the dsm specifically states that cultural context is important and that a classification structure that identifies 80 + % of the world as mentally ill would n't be particularly useful ? 
  i also assume that you 've identified how it 's both maladaptive and distressing since they 're two pre-requisites for mental illness . 
  unless , of course , you 've just got that opinion on faith . 
  you jumped through a lot of hoops to justify that one . 
  there 's no evidence of higher incidence of mental illness for religious people . 
  there 's also quite a lot of evidence that average levels of subjective well-being are higher ( read : happiness ) although that seems to be conflated by in-group factors . 
  okay then , since you did n't get my exceedingly subtle point , what is your evidence that it fits the criteria for a mental illness ? 
  at what mental illness and religiosity ? 
  dozens .

  what is wrong with the first sentence ? 
   it is generally thought that science helps good ** ideas ** triumph over bad . 
  ( emphasis mine ), 
  which is definitely true . 
  people obviously vary in how they act across situations . 
  when i 'm teaching , i have to act extraverted even though i 'm normally an introvert since the class would be really boring if i sat there silently . 
  what personality talks about is n't how people act ** in all situations ** , it measures a tendency to act in a certain way . 
  so an extravert will act in an extraverted way in more situations than an introvert . 
  that 's why either extreme of ( a ) personality explains everything or ( b ) the situation explains everything are both silly positions . 
  which is the point of interactionism . 
  it 's an interaction between tendencies and the situation . 
  right which is the point of the article . 
  mischel was arguing against a strawman and i think the reality is that almost all personality psychs have advocated for an interactionism for a long time . 
  mischel 's more recent work is actually a form on interactionism too ( just an overly complicated version ) . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by that . 
  i do n't know much about it but not sure how it relates to this debate . 
   personality could be less fixed and more situational than we realize and this would still be very interesting, 
  interactionism does n't argue for a 50/50 split though . 
  good and bad in terms of quality . 
  they 're not judging morality , just quality of argument . 
  how else would we discuss it ? 
  which did n't work on * all * people . 
  if all that matters is the situation , 100 % of people should have turned it all the way .
