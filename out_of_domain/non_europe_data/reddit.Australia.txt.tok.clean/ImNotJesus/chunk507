  later studies also showed that personality relates to likelihood to turn the knob all the way . 
  i think you 're getting a bit confused here . 
  situationism argues that it 's 100 % situation and 0 % personality . 
  some early personality theorists ( at least according to mischel ) claimed that it was 100 % personality and 0 % situation . 
  interactionism is the idea that there is some combination of the two that varies . 
  you do n't need to cast off the importance of the situation to dismiss situationism as a wrong estimate . 
  i 've read a bit of penrose and it 's basically all just wishful thinking from what i can tell . 
  you 're literally describing interactionism . 
  thanks for clarifying where the confusion is . 
  i 'll make another comment . 
  it seems like there 's a bit of confusion here stemming from seeing personality and situationism as an either/or proposition . 
  in reality , almost all personality psychs advocate for what 's called `` interactionism '' . 
  interactionism is the idea that personality * tendencies * dictate how you 're likely to act * on average * . 
  it is the underlying assumption of virtually all personality research . 
  so an extraverted person will act in an extraverted manner in more situations than an introvert . 
  at the same time , they wo n't act like an extravert in ** every situation ** . 
  i 'm more of an introvert but when i 'm teaching it does n't make sense to sit quietly . 
  so there 's an interaction between my tendency and the situation that predicts my behaviour . 
  i have no idea what you 're arguing for or about , sorry . 
  to preempt some confusion coming up in the / r/everythingscience post . .

  in contrast , situationism basically argues that personality ** does n't matter ** . 
  so in interactionism , an extraverted person will act in an extraverted manner in more situations than an introvert .

   people are sick of being branded as racist , nazi , vile and despicable for expressing concerns about islam - while innocent people across europe are literally being slain in their homelands . 
  there are plenty of nuanced ways to talk about islam that ( a ) do n't blame over 1 billion people for the actions of literal outliers and ( b ) still accepts that beliefs matter . 
  none of the comments below are that . 
  common mistake . 
  my thesis is a combination of personality and social psychology . 
  it 's pretty silly to pretend they do n't influence each other . 
  i 'm honestly more confused after reading it . 
  i mean you could n't be more ignorant if you tried . 
  do you think terrorism is some new thing and that it only applies to islam ? 
   they 're saying that they believe that there are enough terrorists in islam for it to be a concern , or that they believe that islam incites terrorism . 
  let 's follow that logic then . 
  if we assume that there is a higher proportion of muslims who are terrorists ( which i do n't concede but for the sake of argument ) , should we take that approach to other issues ? 
  men are disproportionately likely to commit sex crimes . 
  perhaps we should disallow immigration of men ? 
  white men are disproportionately likely to commit white collar crimes . 
  should we not allow white men to be ceos ? 
  hi locomotiontomorrow , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ), 
  it does not include references to new , peer-reviewed research . 
  please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience . 
  * if you feel this was done in error , or would like further clarification , please do n't hesitate to [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fscience&amp;message=my%20post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4u679n/da_vincis_irrelevant_doodles_actually_contain_his/ ) . 
  i am so fucking sick of people in this sub complaining about people `` silencing others '' in this debate . 
  sorry but you being downvoted for making sweeping statements of over 1 billion people because of literal outliers is n't you being silenced , it 's people thinking you 're a fucking idiot . 
  `` free speech '' does n't make you immune to criticism , the fact that you can say and it and i can then call you a `` fucking idiot '' is literally free speech working as intended . 
  we both get our say . 
  personality is a combination of nature and nurture . 
  it 's a very complex relationship though . 
  for example , if you 're a small child who shows extraverted behaviour , your parents are more likely to give you extraverted activities to do , thus increasing your proclivity for those activities . 
  not really . 
  i think mischel was kind of arguing against a strawman there . 
  all of it . 
  there 's no `` personality '' gene . 
  humans are complicated and we interact with the world in complicated ways . 
  how is it irrelevant ? 
  terrorism is n't some new thing that islam is doing . 
  if it 's not specific to * islam * , then it 's not * about * islam . 
  blaming islam is missing the point . 
  will fix . 
  yet almost none in indonesia . 
  funny that when you cherry pick it makes it easy for someone else to do the same . 
  it 's not though . 
  one 's genes matter too . 
  the `` blank slate '' notion has been dismissed for quite a while . 
  what 's more , the interaction has downstream affects in both cases . 
  for example , a child that is showing a lot of extraverted traits , is likely to have their parents put them in situations that reward and encourage extraversion . 
  similarly , if i 'm neurotic and sensitive to the threat involved in social engagement , i may be less likely to engage in social situations and thus feel more threat . 
  in short , the subtext to any discussion in psychology should be `` humans be complicated '' . 
  well , yes , but now you 're talking determinism and redefining situation so broadly that it loses all descriptive meaning . 
  because , dingus , opening a single history book would tell us that this issue is n't ** about ** islam but about what happens when you have ** the sociopolitical situation that allows terrorism to thrive ** . 
  blaming islam for terrorism is like blaming the car when a drunk driver hits a wall . 
  nurture is about how you were raised , situation is about how you respond to dynamic change in your environment . 
  which is what makes it interesting that there are still professors fighting for it, 
  yeah but saying unpopular things and complaining about it being unpopular is like kicking a dog and then complaining when you get bit . 
  at least own it . 
  scientists are human after all . 
  of course you 'd say that you pinko communist nazi sjw racist islamophobe . 
  joking aside , i do think high effort middle ground stuff does okay on here , at least compared to most subs . 
  so more lax commenting rules is one big part . 
  the other is that not all posts need to be about new peer-reviewed research . 
  this post would break the rules of / r/science but does n't in / r/everythingscience, 
  do you have a source for that , i 'd love to read it . 
  you 're not being silenced , people just do n't like your opinion . 
  there 's a difference . 
  you can be an ass all you like , no one is stopping you . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  if only the racist nutter is representing your thoughts then perhaps it 's time to view them through a more critical eye . 
  that gets rid of christians and jews too . 
  i can fish out some verses pretty easily if you want . 
  so your answer to a small subsection of 1 religion is to say that you want the entire world to be atheist ? 
  personality is still predictive , it 's just not a perfect prediction because humans are really complicated . 
  dbt is also more commonly used for personality disorders which are historically very resistant to treatment . 
  with worn out underarms from all the pit stains,
