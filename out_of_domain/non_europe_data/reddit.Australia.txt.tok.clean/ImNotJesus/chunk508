  you 're getting downvoted because you 're essentially calling for a huge number of people to be put into abject poverty because you personally know one person who you do n't like . 
  to be fair , both jawas seem fun .

  i have a rebel team that uses a 7 * lumi for gw and am currently working on lando . 
  so once my lando is stronger i do n't need to get many other scoundrels ? 
  what should i aim for ? 
  i was hoping to be able to do the mod challenges too . 
  what about for the mod challenges ? 
  so i 'd have to invest too heavily if i wanted to get all 3 done ? 
  my main team is rebel ( level 67 ) and i want to be able to do more tier 3 challenges . 
  jedi seems the next easiest but defence is n't that great so i 'm just trying to work out what else i can clear as f2p . 
  would be easy to clear with my squad but does n't really seem worth the effort , right ? 
  just hard to know who i can build as f2p that would clear . 
  i 've got rg and vader from empire , phasma from first order and not much else of use outside of my rebels and jedis . 
  as f2p , which is easier out of empire and first order ? 
  i 've got phasma almost 7 * , rg 3 * and vader 4 * . 
  i know this research was done in america but it seems relevant to the safe schools debate . 
  i have hk 4 * and 88 6 * with rg , 86 and about to get je . 
  i 'll definitely 7 * my 88 before getting nebit but should i also 7 * my hk first or start on nebit next ? 
  he has been immensely classy and conciliatory since the primaries wrapped up . 
  it 's also not ** that ** atypical . 
  comments are the point of many of the biggest subs . 
  i would argue that it 's also true of askreddit , iama , askscience etc. 
  why those particular characters instead of all tanks ? 
  do they have higher base armor ? 
  oooo that 's fantastic . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've thought about that too . 
  would be really fun . 
  i think you 'd want a tank and/or someone who gives tm so st han could work for both . 
  other option could be someone like old ben to to counter aa/healing . 
  apparently people who have jobs and feel somewhat hopeful for the future are less likely to steal and/or throw their life away . 
  i am personally ** shocked ** by this . 
  hi ramonvillasante , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  but how do we feel morally superior if we see it as a public health issue and not druggy scum with no personal control ? 
  thanks  !, 
  and anyone not living in an echo chamber knew that was extremely unlikely . 
  so , the comment still stands . 
  i know / r/politics , s4p and t_d really wanted it to be true but mens rea is still a thing and does n't disappear because you dislike hillary . 
  wait , the group of thin-skinned , angry , white nationalist bullies who support a thin-skinned , angry , white nationalist bully is n't receptive to outside opinions and can be occasionally hypocritical . 
  call ripley because i ** do not ** believe that . 
  it 's almost like having actual policies is better than grandstanding in front of the press all day . 
  there 's a difference between her not having policies and trump simply stating that she will do something different to her stated policies . 
  just because it 's not playing well in the polls does n't make it untrue . 
  he has filed for bankruptcy 6 times after being born into immense wealth and opportunity . 
   the tpp is a singular issue , and it 's the only one where she might flip flop after being elected . 
  it 's also not flip flopping to change one 's mind based on new/better information . 
  the tpp is one of the most complicated trade documents ever written . 
  obama supports it and i 'm sure he has great reasons to . 
  it 's entirely possible that she may support it with more time and consideration . 
  the tpp is such a weird one to talk about too because it 's not even an ideological issue as much as just a complicated trade deal . 
  nah , pretending that it 's not a first past the post ( effectively ) two-party system is definitely better . 
  it 's like that time i went to the store to buy some cake and they did n't have any so i hit myself in the nuts with a hammer because i refused to buy cupcake on principle . 
  what evidence do you base that on ? 
  it runs counter to the stances of every major psychological body in the world so i 'm really curious scientific evidence and qualifications you have for * your * claim . 
  the content ... 
  what about the tpp ? 
  her policy is that she 's against it . 
  never heard of them . 
  you may not believe her but that 's not what i said . 
  and drastic changes in foreign policy should n't happen as a result of literal outliers . 
  sometimes being a leader means standing up to populist fear and doing the right thing anyway . 
  i like the part where you make up things i think and say . 
  is it easier to feel self-righteous that way or do you do it because you do n't have a rational argument ? 
  no , it 's the mentality of ** representational democracy ** . 
  where those who are elected to make good decisions based on best available information do so . 
  germany just needs an ocean on all of its borders , off-shore concentration camps , to make sure that all boats sink in international waters and refuse all requests for information on how many boats are actually coming . 
  it 's like they 're not even trying . 
   so you admit it 's happening, 
  when did i deny terrorist attacks occur ? 
   at least it 's progress . 
  progress from what ? 
  it 's an entirely different question . 
  i did n't tell you to vote for her , i just said that she 's made clear statements about her policies . 
  whether you personally think she 's telling the truth is entirely different . 
  and this was n't one so why does that matter ? 
  i would n't say that they have * nothing * to do with islam . 
  i would say that given that terrorism is an outlier it would be statistically incoherent to call it a causal factor though . 
  yes , within the group of islamic people terrorists are outliers . 
  so ... opinion crimes ? 
   no , not opinion crimes . 
  hiding and protecting terrorist crimes , giving material support to terrorist crimes, 
  and you have evidence that this is a ** significant ** portion of all muslims ? 
   yes , of course i do . 
  go on then . 
   and when you 're talking about a population of 1.2 billion , any percentage over .1 is a large number . 
  which is why proportionality matters . 
  if .1 % of white men are rapists that 's quite a lot of rapists . 
  should we not allow white men to enter certain countries as a result ? 
  it 's not a head in the sand to not be constantly panicked . 
  i just do n't think you 're appraising the risk or causes very rationally . 
  you claimed that they were actively harbouring and helping , that 's different to attitudes . 
  do you have proof of your actual claim ? 
  hi all ,,
