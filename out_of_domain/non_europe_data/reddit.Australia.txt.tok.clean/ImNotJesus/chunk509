  they need to go back to their / r/the _ donald safe space where dissent is banned . 
  need to run back to their / r/the _ donald safe space . 
  yeah , it 's pretty tough to write a negative article about what trump says because he 's always so meticulous with his words . 
  how do they keep coming up with these new `` hit pieces '' where they repeat the things he says . 
  they called him out for the things he has said or done . 
  almost all of which were factual , even if you have different values . 
  you ca n't deny that he mocked a disabled woman , even if you think it 's not that big a deal . 
  he responded by , instead of commenting on what was actually said , mocking a grieving mother . 
  it 's not even close to similar and it 's no surprise that someone who likes donald ca n't tell the difference between thin skinned bullying and genuine opposition . 
  also , he was `` attacked '' in the dnc ** far ** more respectfully than was done to hillary the week before . 
  yeah , the point of what i said was definitely the extent to which the mother is grieving versus just really , really sad . 
  excellent point to pick up on and super relevant to how shitty what he said was . 
  yeah but why would he argue with substance now when he can just call names and mock people like the thin skinned bully he is ? 
  yup . 
  point out the fact that islamic terrorist are literally outliers and you love dead children . 
  mention that there 's no rational reason to believe that if you swapped every muslim to christian and christian to muslim that there would be an appreciable difference and you 're an evidence ignoring lunatic . 
  blaming islam is just laughable if you have ** any ** sense of perspective on the matter . 
  sure , beliefs matter and i wish large parts of islam were different but there is sufficient doctrine in almost any religion to justify those sorts of atrocities . 
  it 's the sociopolitical issues that cause terrorism , not the flavour it comes in . 
  hell , google `` buddhist terrorism '' if you do n't believe . 
   jihadists , fundamentalists and islamists comprise of around 400 million muslims ( pew research ) , they basically want non-muslims dead and sharia law installed . 
  pope logic , 400 million = small group . 
  also , the pope logic : be nice to muslims or they 'll kill you . 
  why then are only a tiny percentage of those violent ? 
   you know the ira was and is still a thing , right ? 
  [ buddhism and violence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhism_and_violence ) . 
  belief in islam is neither sufficient or meaningfully predictive of being a terrorist . 
  it would be statistically ludicrous to say otherwise . 
  anyone who think this is n't about sociopolitical conditions and nationalism needs to read a fucking book . 
  it 's almost like people use dogma to justify their nationalist or otherwise already held beliefs . 
  the boy who lived above the rim, 
  yes because the sociopolitical situation improved . 
  i wonder if there 's any relationship between the decimation of iraq , dismantling of all their industry ( in the guise of raeganomics ) , firing a large portion of their teachers , dismantling their major political party etc. 
  has anything to do with isis . 
  could n't be , it must be the doctrine . 
  are you arguing that there is n't sufficient justification in the bible of any of the acts we 're seeing ? 
  because , you 're just wrong . 
   christianity is mostly active in developed nations , where reasons to pick up arms are fewer . 
  and when they were n't there were very similar problems . 
   not according to any branch of christianity with any level of political control either formal or informal . 
  right , so why do you think `` modern '' christianity is different to the crusades christianity ? 
  this new character rey seems to be doing really well with speed buffs . 
  matthew 5:18 for i tell you truly , until heaven and earth pass away , not a single jot , not a stroke of a pen , will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished . 
  that is , until the second coming not a word of the old testament is to be disregarded . 
  in case anyone is interested , the myers-briggs is about as accurate as your horoscope and is entirely disregarded in academic psychology ( which does n't stop overpriced hr consultants suggesting it ) . 
  you may find it interesting but my statement is still true . 
  it 's not respected at all ** in academic psychology ** . 
   but it certainly works , and is n't nonsense . 
  how do you know ? 
   afaik , academic psychology uses big 5 , which as an extra axis , a bit of stuff relabeled and made explicit , etc. 
  mbti indeed lines up with big 5 in a variety of ways , as people with the same mbti type will end up getting similar big 5 results . 
  the big 5 is common but there are other variations . 
  the reason that it 's useful is that it predicts behaviour and other psychological constructs ( which the mbti does n't ) . 
   either way , it 's important to distinguish the model ( thought up by carl jung ) and the test/typing quiz ( by myers-briggs ) . 
  how can we say something is a good model without empirical evidence ? 
  a model without evidence is just an opinion . 
   the test is nonsense and does n't work at all, 
  i thought you said it predicts big 5 ? 
   the model is pretty interesting , even if it 's not standardized and rigorous enough for academic psychology . 
  people also find horoscopes interesting . 
  the problem with the whole top half is `` how do we know ? '', 
  the reality is that , scientifically speaking , if we ca n't measure something we ca n't know that it 's true . 
  it 's fine if you * want * it to be true or even that you think it is true but to claim it as anything other than pseudoscience until there 's some shred of evidence that it 's a useful model ( and ** plenty ** have tried ) , it 's just wishful thinking . 
  in terms of the bottom half , it 's all anecdotes . 
  which is fine if you want it to believe it as true but when you start making claims that something is true about the world , it becomes an empirical question . 
   i do n't think you understand it . 
  mbti is a preference indicator . 
  i 'm doing my phd in personality and social psychology .

  i also think this is a blatant `` us vs them '' move , which is a huge part of his campaign . 
  it 's a remarkable combo of `` we 're the greatest '' and `` the whole world is against us '' . 
  but muh copypasta, 
  if you had an unlimited budget and total control , where would you want to see the next few large missions headed towards ? 
  but i ca n't be a libertarian , i 'm not a first year econ student with no human emotions . 
  i know a great [ immigration attorney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khizr_khan ), 
  do n't forget their main criteria , `` not brown '' . 
  just like commu ... never mind . 
  and we all know that basing ideologies off of fiction has never ended badly , just ask the scientologists . 
  this simple pamphlet will explain why you deserve the opportunity you were born into and that poor people always deserve to starve . 
  they should have chosen to be born with bigger bootstraps . 
  of course it can , my comment was intended as a joke . 
   stein is n't an option if you value science . 
  what if i value science but only the `` science '' you find on infowars ? 
  scared of the wifi signals i 'm projecting ? 
  it would be really hard to make a word with 7 ds in words with friends . 
  the grand irony being that the photos causing this new information were leaked to distract away from ... a fucking immigration lawyer . 
  is it possible to overdose on schadenfreude ? 
  i believe the technical term is `` not brown '' . 
   nonetheless , the cascade to the precipice continues .
