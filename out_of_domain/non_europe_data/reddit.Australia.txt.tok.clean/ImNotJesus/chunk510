  if the last 2 weeks have taught us anything it 's that trump does n't deal well with opposition and criticism . 
  this is only going to lead to worse decisions/comments . 
   he is n't trying to become president . 
  while i would always caution away from diagnosis at a distance , his behaviour is entirely typical of someone with narcissistic personality disorder . 
   good lord , they 're not cockroaches . 
  good luck with your inbox . 
  say anything vaguely positive about muslim people on reddit these days and you regret it . 
  does that mean dead black people are coming back to vote hillary ? 
   well the only white demo he was doing good with were non educated white men . 
  but that does n't fit with t_d at all !, 
  hi muhammadshoaibqadri , your submission has been removed for the following reason ( s ),

  i love how your complaint about lack of nuance is basically the least nuanced statement on the topic . 
  well done . 
  i wish for a second you could get off your high horse to see how ironic everything you 're saying is . 
  i could n't agree more that there should be more nuance in the discussion but you 're arguing it by throwing out insane statements that characterise everyone else as extremes . 
  you 're literally doing the exact thing you 're complaining about . 
  if you subjugate an entire group for generations it takes more than no longer subjugating them for things to become vaguely even ground . 
  arena shipments : hk and 88, 
  use hk ( l ) , 88 , 86 , rg and poggle in arena until you get je and then drop poggle . 
  for gw , use hk , 88 , 86 , je and poggle . 
  do n't start farming nebit until your 88 is 7 * . 
  yeah , you can basically alternate poggle/je buffs so that you have one for each battle or save both for a harder node coming up . 
  this guy is correct . 
  it 's why humans are naturally bad at doing science . 
  think of it this way , if you flip a coin 10,000 times , you 're going to have periods of lots of heads in a row . 
  if happen to look at those heads , you could be easily convinced that the coin was rigged . 
  humans are really bad at estimating probability and have all sorts of [ cognitive biases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases ) as a result . 
  yup . 
  i never invite and am always glad when they do . 
  thanks for the inbox notification to check rankings . 
  potator ? 
  really hard to say but so far it looks like trump is really hurting republicans downballot . 
   if even one of his supporters reads into that statement 's worst possible intent and takes it seriously , we have a very real problem . 
  yup . 
  it only takes one person . 
  his campaign is built on dog whistles , conspiracy theories and white nationalism and when you 've whipped up a rabid base on the idea that the whole world is against them , it does n't take a lot of `` suggestion '' for someone to take it way too far . 
  in a vacuum , this is a dangerous statement . 
  in the context of everything else he has said , we should be legitimately worried . 
   i suspect that the more gop members will take this as a chance to jump ship . 
  it 's coming . 
  i think the reality of how different this statement is to everything else will set in soon . 
  we already all agree speech is no longer free when it incites violence and while i do n't think what he did was technically illegal , it crosses a very real boundary . 
   the idea that this is `` dishonest media '' , and that he 's really talking about the nra lobbying and getting people to vote for him , that 's all spin and does n't even fit with what he said . 
  even if we 're ** absurdly generous ** and say that he was loose with his words and did n't mean it , any rational person would ** immediately ** apologise profusely and blame being tired from campaigning on some poorly chosen words . 
  i would n't spend too much time on mod battles until you can 3 * one of the challenges . 
  that being said , it 's better to get mods than farm a character you do n't need . 
  is there anyone you * need * from cantina right now ? 
  the problem you have with that team is that you need to give people a reason to not focus on lando straight away . 
  i would be looking at someone like jka instead . 
  do you have speed mods on rey and jka ? 
  you still wo n't be faster than a je but should help . 
  i 'm in academia ( the other major pathway to clinical psych ) and could n't love it more . 
  it 's insanely competitive and underpaid for how competitive it is but if you 're interested in going down that path it 's just really fun . 
  my job is literally just thinking/reading about the world and then testing those ideas . 
  you wo n't earn anything without an advanced degree but you can certainly make a * reasonable * living if you make it to a phd or become a clinician . 
  just an undergrad degree in psych wo n't get you much though . 
  i 'm currently running aa , leia , sthan , lando , phasma and regularly finish # 1 on my shard . 
  i try to have lando going early and then coming up again immediately after aa 's first turn . 
  jka lead with that squad would be a nightmare to deal with . 
  newer shard , i 'm level 75 . 
  drop to 15 max overnight . 
  plenty of p2p accounts that are beatable . 
   if your change of name application is successful , you will receive either a new birth certificate ( if you were born in victoria ) or a change of name certificate ( if you were born overseas ) . 
   your certificate will show your previous name , your new name , and a history of your name changes . 
  i mean you 're literally wrong and it would 've taken you less than 8 seconds of googling to find that . 
  people also try to claim pastafarianism as their religion . 
  golden `` i use terms i do n't understand because the hate subs on reddit i like use them '' slumbers, 
  it 's an imperfect solution to a complicated problem . 
  realistically , people are n't changing their sex ( since you ca n't change your chromosomes ) but because the system is already built around conflating sex and gender , it 's easier to continue conflating the two than fixing that larger problem . 
  your birth certificate is used as a basis for virtually all other id , that 's why you get a new one when you change your name too , even though your name at birth did n't change . 
   why change the sex ? 
  i literally just explained why . 
  well i was speaking shorthand , there are obviously variations in sex but chromosomes are one of the standard ways to define biological sex . 
  stop being the most edgy man on the planet . 
  they really should n't have changed the rules so that the government can only ever worry about 1 issue . 
  oh well , hopefully next year they 'll pick something different . 
  that stache is never going out of style, 
  how easily did you get through stage 7 . 
  wondering if i 'll be able to do it with level 75 toons at slightly lower gear . 
  ahh i wo n't have either at 7 . 
  i 've got 7 * han ( g8 ) , lando ( g9 ) , leia ( g8 ) , luke ( g8 ) and working on biggs as fast as i can but there 's no way to get aa or lobot there in time . 
  first 4 are level 75 . 
  would it be possible to add in gw shipments ? 
  biggs is faster for that reason . 
  i 'm convinced he 's trying to court the black vote by negging . 
   why do you think he keeps doing ` black outreach ' to entirely white crowds ? 
  who else is goes to his rallies ? 
  dat persecution complex, 
  i do n't have a moff . 
  i 'm contemplating getting one to go with palp but the order he uses them makes a big difference for how viable that is . 
  much rather get rid of 5s to add in a second tank . 
  ahhh that 's a shame . 
  the other way around would be so much better with palp lead, 
  so you 're running a palp lead ? 
  what team and are you liking it ? 
  is moff worth the farm then ? 
  i do n't have him at all .
