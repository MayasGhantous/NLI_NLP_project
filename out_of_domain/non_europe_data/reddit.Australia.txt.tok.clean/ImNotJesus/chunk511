  have you tried palp as non-leader ? 
  do you know if his unique works with 88 lead ? 
  was thinking of trying it out . 
  that seems like a powerful interaction right ? 
   jawa engineer ? 
  he was already consistently first without speed mods . 
  yup . 
  am australian and that fits my experience, 
   it 's saying there 's no evidence it does . 
  there is no evidence it does n't . 
  which is why it 's a controversy . 
  please provide evidence that i ca n't speak german . 
  the onus of evidence is on the person making a * positive * claim , that is , the one that saying something is true about the world . 
  that 's even more important when you 're dealing with people 's health . 
  the minimum standard should be above `` you ca n't prove that it does n't work '' . 
   although i do agree with your stance here , it 's worth noting that such anecdotal evidence still has value ... 
  there are many qualitative research articles that use such nothing but anecdotal evidence . 
  so really , people 's stories can be a great source of information , it 's just important to hear them using common sense . 
  qualitative research is n't just `` people 's opinions '' though . 
  anecdotes are data points , they 're just not reliable data points for some things . 
  have you considered that if he received evidence based treatment his back might have actually improved by now ? 
   but here 's the deal , some of what they do is not only medically beneficial , it 's seen as medically necessary by the medical field in general , and by doctors who specialize in recovery from injuries specifically . 
   sometimes spinal adjustments are needed . 
  which is why your insurance will almost always cover them , at least in a limited fashion . 
  sorry but anecdotal evidence , even from medical professionals , is still anecdotal evidence . 
  without positive evidence that chiropractic adjustment is clinically beneficial and safe , it should n't be given to anyone . 
   obviously the researchers who have devoted their life to studying spinal injuries knows better than you . 
  ftfy, 
  i submitted a ticket asking for reimbursement , you should too . 
  this is obviously false . 
  anyone can see that she was corrupt and committed treason to solicit donations to a charity that she does n't take an income from / s, 
   cops responded to the fight and found red marks on her left wrist and the right side of her neck , according to a police report released by santa monica officials friday . 
  are there police reports of you assaulting her ? 
  if so , she probably has reason to think you 're a dick .

   trump never owned slaves . 
  he has a long history of racism though . 
  not owning slaves is n't exactly the benchmark for a decent human being . 
  it 's also `` patriotic '' to support a presidential candidate whose entire platform is `` everything is fucked and only i can fix it '' . 
  i guess you 're only allowed to be unhappy with the status quo if you 're white ( or orange ) . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  he 's literally negging black people . 
  `` never worry about dogwhistles when they all become bullhorns '', 
   but rex still does . 
  what a weird and totally unremarkable coincidence that both rex and fun sack are both popular pay to win characters . 
  nebit is still better for gw i think , so it 's not a total waste . 
  you already know my feelings on the soon to arrive tusken raider raid meta . 
  it 's even in the name !, 
  they 're the `` i do n't like rules that tell me i ca n't do things '' type of libertarian . 
  wait , you 're saying it is n't corruption for the democrats to internally want the actual democrat to win ? 
  but muh e-mails and hillary 's super cancer .

  you mean brown . 
  you do n't want any random * brown * body . 
   here is the crazy thing ... the center of his campaign and all this energy is about something that in reality will have very little impact on the us , relative to other issues, 
  it will have an objectively negative benefit . 
  most estimates are that a wall would cost between 10-15 billion dollars . 
  billion . 
  add the massive detriment to diplomacy and international standing and it 's not even close to no effect . 
  it 's called `` dehumanisation '' and is the basis of a lot of study in moral psychology . 
  basically , you need to pose a person or group as lesser to justify them not being deserving of moral care . 
  first they came for the mexicans . . 
  all cuisines matter, 
  i only like games where i can instantly finish all content . 
  that 's why i spend my day google imaging `` you win '' screens . 
  dm does n't even gain anything ( edit : of much value ) from ep lead . 
  yeah a little health but but no use for potency and does n't get tm . 
  so out of 3 leader benefits he gets the least useful one ? 
  colour me excited . 
  oh , and besides that you 're relying on a rework . 
  cool !, 
  also , fun fact , being snarky and condescending does n't make you right , it just makes you a dick , even if thinking about how edgy you are allows you to get that semi you 'd always hoped for . 
  no the warmth of your smug self-satisfaction is more than enough .

  can andrews please be our pm already . 
  exactly . 
  we should expect a release of comprehensive medical records like trump ga. . . oh ... well at least we know about his ta . . nevermind . 
  at least we * know * he would never improperly use a founda ... 
  i thought hillary 's latest tweet was really on point about this - [ link ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/crs7iudweaaoidu.jpg ), 
  yup , you really have to ignore a lot of natural instincts . 
  there 's no end of people telling them what to do , someone just listening and normalising their feelings is what makes the difference .
