  well done being there for someone who needed you !, 
   that being said , even if someone did ask me i 'd lie and say i 'm fine because no one wants to talk about mental health , especially blokes . 
  it 's changing but slowly . 
  sorry to hear you 've been going through a rough time .

  exactly . 
  they had penises to make them strong and mighty . 
  would you say that it makes you want to * scream * ? 
   anyone , regardless of gender , who is smarter than you ( or appears to be ) will usually seem intimidating . 
  while true , there 's a decade of research that says that women who are more competent are seen as less likeable , especially when they do so in typically male roles . 
  cuddy and fiske in particular have done some extremely influential research on the topic . 
  so while it may be true that people generally do n't like feeling stupid , we have a lot of evidence that it 's simply not the same between genders . 
   a basic evolutionary explanation would be that women who are better than men they seem less accessible and thus a turn off . 
  this is not limited to intelligence , there are many cases where men do n't approach women because they are very good looking . 
  this seems like baseless speculation to me . 
   ( a ) results of such studies should not be overgeneralized . 
  not getting close enough does not mean decreased interest per se . 
  also , men should not suffer from decreased self-esteem when they are told that the potential partner has higher emotional intelligence . 
  this is expected ; both culturally and biologically . 
  and most of the time being emotional is a negative thing for men anyway . 
  there 's a decade of research on the topic . 
  women who are seen as more competent as seen as less likeable , especially when they are competent in traditionally male roles . 
  if you do n't think that answers your question you did n't understand the references ( which you obviously did n't read in that time ) . 
  in short , the research shows that women who are seen as competent ( read : smart ) , tend to be seen as less warm ( read : liked ) . 
  this * does n't * happen to men . 
  if you put all of those pieces together then by definition , when a woman is smarter , she is less liked . 
  when a man is smarter , he is not less liked . 
  you do n't see a difference between commenting on something subjective like politics and something objective like medicine ? 
  on what basis do you think that evaluations of how `` likeable '' a person is does n't relate to their suitability for a romantic partner . 
  do you think that people tend to date people they * do n't * like ? 
  if i said to you that i like women who have blonde hair more than brunettes , do you think i would be more likely to date a blonde or a brunette ? 
  please point to the place where i said that . 
  you do n't think it 's worth caring about the difference between opinion and fact ? 
  do you think your thoughts on the efficacy of vaccines is equivalent to your thoughts on which music is good ? 
  on what basis ? 
  keep in mind that your opinion and feelings are n't a source . 
  thank you for being a perfect example of why this is a problem !, 
  sir , i 'm going to need to see your depasturing license . 
  also , marriage is about having babies which is why sterile people are n't allowed to get married . 
  swing and miss, 
   i 'm a deliberately barren married woman . 
  well there 's your problem . 
  as a good , godfearing woman you should 've known that your role was in the home caring for children . 
  it 's weird that you think your life can have purpose without being a mother . 
  because if you call it `` evolutionarily adaptive '' you do n't need evidence . 
  only soft sciences . 
  in the real sciences it does n't work because 100 % of their studies replicate .

  if you just keep pressing and not looking you can easily do it while watching a tv show . 
  nothing says my station in life is secure better than `` let 's blow up the system to send a message '' . 
  yeah i met a psychologist once . 
  i asked him what number i was thinking of and he was n't even close, 
   they think they 're being oppressed if they have to drink out of a plain red starbucks cup , ffs . 
  it 's not even them , these are the people that genuinely think `` do n't be racist '' is an attack on white people . 
  there is one mod there that is clearly not well educated at all . 
  i keep stating that she is wrong but she just keeps posting random stuff on subjects she clearly knows nothing about . 
  i get that giving up is the easiest solution . 
  but i think that my solutions could at least improve science subs . 
  wait . 
  so you 're having continued interactions with someone who has expertise in a topic and your entire proof that they 're incompetent is that * you * think they 're wrong . 
  may i ask what qualifications you have in psychology ?

  well that 's very vague . 
  can you give me an example of a time that they were wrong and you were right ? 
  i 'd love to see something specific . 
  that 's typical of a thin-skinned alt-right bigot mindset . 
  take an individualised joke about a party that has campaigned on denying women rights and expand it to be an attack on all bigots . 
  pathetic . 
  ... you 've never heard of abortion ? 
  i 'm entirely willing to say that i 'm intolerant of people who are intolerant . 
  and show me where i ever mentioned the constitution . 
  yes and if you ca n't see a difference between being intolerant of racist/sexist/homophobic people and actually being those things , you probably deserve to sit in the basket with the rest of them . 
  again , i never mentioned the constitution . 
  it would be strange for it to be in there given the timeline . 
  but , fun fact , something does n't need to be in the constitution for it to be a good value . 
  your problem is not seeing those as problems . 
  oh yeah , i love abortions . 
  i try to kill as many fetuses as possible . 
  ca n't get enough of it . 
  you do n't go out on the weekend just slaying as many unborn children as you can for fun ? 
  actually , the data says that she was wrong and it 's 58 % , not 50 % . 
  yes , we should make murder legal since it being illegal did n't stop all murders . 
  it 's such a non-starter as soon as you substitute in any other group .
