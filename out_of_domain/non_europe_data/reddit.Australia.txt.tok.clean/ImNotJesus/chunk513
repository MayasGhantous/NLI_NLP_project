  if more than 50 % of the public wanted to not allow aboriginals to use the same drinking fountains it would still be abhorrent to take it to a vote . 
  the only reason it does n't feel abhorrent to these cunts is that on some level they think of gay people as less deserving of rights . 
  breaking news : pauline wants to build a wall between australia and muslemico . 
  i want to build a wall around your spelling . 
  milo responds and has his comment removed by mods . 
  it 's still visible from his userpage and basically just says `` trust me '' : https://www.reddit.com/user/yiannopoulos_m/, 
  worth noting that milo has a history of stealing charity money : http://www.mediaite.com/online/breitbarts-milo-yiannopoulos-raised-100k-for-charity-deposits-it-in-his-bank-account/, 
  they were up all night getting scammed by milo and a mysterious tax avoiding overseas millionaire that definitely exists . 
  i assume that most people who make their career bashing marginalised groups and bullying people are otherwise exemplary moral characters . 
   her foundation accepted money from bad countries , so she should drop out !!, 
  she 's so corrupt . 
  she literally committed treason with her foundation just to solicit donations to line her pockets with all the 0s of dollars she takes as salary . 
  i think he just did . 
  i think your sarcasm detector is on the fritz, 
  read it again, 
  yeah but hillary 's campaign were slow to tell people that she had pneumonia so it 's about equal . 
  nose candy daddy, 
  if i had a bowl of cheetos and i told you just three would ** set up a foundation to spend other people 's money , including to buy a gold statue ** . 
  would you take a handful ? 
  that 's our ** foundation ** problem . 
  if i had a bowl of cheetos and i told you just three would ** mock a disabled person ** . 
  would you take a handful ? 
  that 's our ** candidate ** problem . 
  wait , so * because * he knows hillary well the endorsement means less ? 
  interesting logic . 
  well the bigger problem is that it trivialises what is actually important terminology in trauma treatment . 
  while it 's really fun to bash pc culture ( apparently ) , the aim of `` trigger warnings '' is to give approprtie warning to ptsd sufferers that a topic being covered may cause them to reexperience their trauma in a situation that could be very difficult to dealt with ( e.g. , in a lecture theatre ), 
  hillary has [ pages and pages ] ( https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/ ) of in depth documents about what her policies are . 
  she 's a notorious policy wonk and was brought in as secretary of state by the guy she lost to in the primaries . 
  she is ** really ** , ** really ** good at policy . 
  you may not like her but the comments in here pretending that she 's just some populist whose policy goes where the wind blows needs to get their news from somewhere other than breitbart or ha goodman . 
  the media have fucked up this election . 
  they 've done the american public a horrible disservice by buying into the circus and false equivalence . 
  if you like trump , good luck to you . 
  but to pretend like this is anything populism vs an actual policy expert is obscene . 
  edit : you can keep pming me your talking points and conspiracy theories but unless you can tell me why both a conservative former president and a socialist opponent both endorse her without a handwaving rant about corruption with no evidence , i 'm probably going to ignore you . 
  people who give a shit about policy want her to win . 
  if you do n't care about policy , that 's fine , but again , do n't pretend this is vaguely equivalent . 
  edit 2 : i stand corrected , [ trump wrote an op-ed today detailing his plans to help america 's poor ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/opinion/hillary-clinton-my-plan-for-helping-americas-poor.html ), 
  trump is also not a fan of the first , unless of course he 's the one talking . 
  as someone with family affected by the holocaust , i have absolutely no problem with it . 
  i have far more of a problem with my jewish friends and family not seeing that the way muslims are being talked about right now is virtually identical to what was said about jews . 
  i meant in general , not trump specifically . 
   just saying both are so terrible that theres no hope for the future, 
  please give me one impeachable offense that is n't cited with breitbart or that she was n't already cleared by the fbi for . 
  melania was the only bidder, 
   a business will never value something more than its bottom line, 
  right , which is why we ca n't rely on the `` invisible free hand of the market '' to make sure people do n't starve to death . 
  i 'm sure the trump foundation will just pay off the debt with other people 's money . 
  that trickle you feel is them pissing all over you, 
  do they in any meaningful way ? 
  and do they do it more than trump 's pacs ? 
  add me please, 
   they 've just decided that a well-regulated militia simply means white people . 
  and free speech is speech they agree with . 
  and the right to vote is the right for not poor black people to vote . 
  and the freedom of religion is the freedom to be a christian . 
  i get that you 're trying to annoy people by parroting their language but you should know that using the term triggered to denote mild emotional upset is actually really offensive to people who have experienced significant trauma . 
  it also trivialises what is actually important terminology in trauma treatment . 
  a trigger being something that is likely to cause a re-experiencing of trauma ( e.g. , a gun shot for someone who developed ptsd at war ) . 
  while it 's really fun to bash pc culture ( apparently ) , the aim of `` trigger warnings '' is to give approprtie warning to ptsd sufferers that a topic being covered may cause them to reexperience their trauma in a situation that could be very difficult to dealt with ( e.g. , discussing rape in a lecture theatre for someone who was traumatised by rape ) . 
  talking about being `` triggered '' by something that is merely annoying is actually quite cruelly mocking . 
  i like the idea of bernie but many of his policies are at best unlikely , at worst ghastly in execution . 
  my favourite example is that he wanted to refuse to trade with anyone not paying the same minimum wage as america . 
  that would literally cause countless people in south east asia to starve to death . 
  instantly , entire economies would be crushed and millions of jobs of the poorest people in the world would disappear overnight . 
  you know who is n't getting $ 15 us/h ? 
  some unskilled labourer in indonesia . 
  nor should they , $ 15/h would make them obscenely rich by local standards . 
  it 's a wonderful idea and trade deals should ( * and do * ) impose standards on international workers but the mindless rhetoric that sanders used * at times * was immensely frustrating . 
  he 's obviously nowhere near the level of trump but he just does n't understand international policy particularly well . 
  i get that they did n't mean to offend but that does n't mean people ca n't strive to do better . 
  i did n't call them any names , i did n't impugn their character - i assumed they did n't know why it is hurtful and tried to explain . 
  they can choose to do with the information what they feel is most appropriate , as can you . 
  which part do you need a citation for ? 
  because dog whistles are so 2000s, 
  credit for being willing to change . 
  you rock . 
  do n't be silly . 
  black people 's rights are n't the same as white people 's rights . 
  i 'll add in an / s because apparently the admins let this site become a recruiting ground for white nationalists and that 's a thing that needs to be clarified now . 
  awesome !, 
  fair point but you could say that about half of the ongoing trump dramas ( rape allegations , trump university , trump foundation , christie and bridgegate etc. ), 
  seriously , go buy a grunge record and be a normal teenager . 
  why do these damn teenagers need to be white supremacists to rebel . 
  because he 's a man of the people !, 
  i 'm sure she 's thought of both of these things . 
  cuban knows that a trump presidency would do far more to his businesses by crashing the economy . 
  so you accept that one candidate is objectively less dangerous than the other * and * that a third party vote is essentially meaningless . 
  does n't that make you obscenely selfish ? 
  in the reason that a bunch of teenagers on t_d are white nationalists ? 
  go on . . 
  please do explain, 
  and thinks wifi causes cancer, 
  i 'm not telling you what to do . 
  i 'm telling you that your words have consequences you may not realise . 
  you can do with that information what you please . 
  that 's entirely up to you . 
  i 'm not telling you what your values should be . 
  i did n't tell you what to say .
