  you can certainly feel free to ignore it . 
   i 'm ** hoping that this explanation ** can lead some of you to be a bit more careful with your words . 
  literally never told you to change your words , just that i thought some of you may if you understood the term better . 
  trumplethinskin, 
   by the way , fucking kudos to op for taking what they knew would be an unpopular stand in defense of what they felt is right . 
  thanks !, 
  people do n't really like being told to reconsider some things . 
  just look at the one long comment chain . 
  i do n't want no scrub . 
  i 'm sure the trump foundation will be happy to pay the fine . 
  well , yes , given that you ca n't be president unless you 're over 35 years of age not being born then is kind of a big deal . 
  i actually think he 's right . 
  every time his mic was used incoherent drivel came out but it did n't happen with hillary 's mic . 
  i think he assumed russia would find something else by now ... awkward ...

  yes . 
  that 's the entire point . 
  you do n't get deplorable eyes with stories about reality . 
  i doubt there was much gagging with those tiny hands, 
  his 10 year old son is helping him with the cyber . 
  please do n't algo, 
  he checked and the guy was extremely white . 
  background check passed . 
  this campaign is a trumpster fire, 
  apparently thin skin is contagious, 
  we 've had some really fantastic discussions here about some difficult issues so i have high hopes that the users can be trusted on this . 
  as / u/nate alluded to , there are respectful and incisive ways to talk about challenging issues that does n't marginalise or derogate others . 
  we are more than happy to have healthy disagreement , just make sure it is ** respectful ** !, 
  as a rule of thumb , would you get up at a conference and ask that question/make that statement ? 
  if so , it 's probably fine . 
  well there are actually tests of implicit bias ( things like the implicit association test ) but you 're right that one should be more skeptical of things measured more indirectly . 
  implicit testing allows us look at issues where it 's much harder to get an honest answer out of people ( like racism ) but require converging lines of evidence . 
  some implicit testing is better than others . 
  as an example , implicit racism measured by the iat predicted voting in the 2008 election [ link ] ( https://www.projectimplicit.net/colintuckersmith/gssbn2009.pdf ) . 
  there 's [ quite a lot of literature ] ( https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=iat+%2b+race&amp;btng=&amp;as_sdt=1%2c5&amp;as_sdtp= ) on it . 
  i 'd encourage you to keep an open mind about methods you do n't understand before disregarding them !, 
  that seems like an entirely valid question as long as it 's done respectfully of course . 
   subjects were also asked to report their voting intention . 
  only those reporting intent to vote for obama ( scored 0 ) or mccain ( scored 1 ) were included in analyses . 
  it tested the relationship between implicit bias and who they intended to vote for . 
  of course it does n't ** necessarily ** generalise to the entire population but no study does . 
  this is going to be [ hard to explain ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/dylanbyers/status/780608777062117377 ), 
  i knew keeping this link would be useful https://mobile.twitter.com/dylanbyers/status/780608777062117377, 
  he ca n't help himself . 
  one of the really sad stories not talked about with the trump foundation is that he never really seemed to actually try to do good with the foundation . 
  i 'm sure lots of foundations use dodgy tax evasion strategies ( likely less brazen than this ) but the fact that he did n't even care enough to ** try ** and use the money funelled through it for good is really telling . 
  for all the conspiracy theories about the clinton foundation , no one can say with a straight face that they did n't try to use it for the good of humanity . 
  when t_d come , they 're not sending their best . 
  i 'm sure both of them had a good time . 
  i 'm sure the trump foundation will be more than happy to cut them a check . 
  well he is a noted anti-vaxxer himself . 
  perhaps this is the most we 've ever seen him donate money in line with his own values - even if they are disgustingly misguided ones .

  thank god someone is saying this . 
  the third party options are ** terrible ** . 
  i 'm not opposed to voting third party on principle but voting for stein because you `` do n't like hillary '' is the definition of cutting off your nose to spite your face . 
   trump 's rhetoric will almost assuredly lead towards inciting violence that could have someone fucking killed, 
  possibly the first female president . 
  i 'm sure more than one person will be inspired to have a second amendment solution . 
  imagine he was also promising to randomly search people and take their guns, 
  hi all ,, 
  while we understand that this is a hot button issue , please remember that we are a science subreddit and not an opinions subreddit . 
  please keep all discussion to the substance of the paper or other relevant research and not personal anecdotes , soapboxing or opinions . 
  you know , i 'm starting to think this trump guy has a bit of a track record of being a hypocrite . 
  i 'm not ready to judge just yet though . 
  oh , also , because i 'm on a younger shard i 'm at a huge disadvantage . 
  fuck me for not playing since launch right ? 
  wait , a charity she receives no income from took money from a foreign government and spent it on curing people of deadly illness . 
  when is the treason trial ? 
  imagine if obama had 5 kids with 3 wives , ran on a platform of random searches to take away people 's guns and lost so much money in a single year he lived tax free for 2 decades . 
  i 'd like to see a reasonable source first . 
  you do n't think ** anyone ** in the mainstream media would be willing to write a story about something this big ? 
  perhaps no one is touching it because it 's a conspiracy theory that only blogs are writing about . 
  or , perhaps , you like to believe silly things with bad evidence and then concoct conspiracies to confirm your already held beliefs . 
  occam 's razor says mine is more likely right . 
  that 's just what the mainstream media wants you to think . 
  you ca n't trust the msm, 
  how do you know, 
  this article says they 're wrong, 
  how do you know you can trust that article, 
  it agrees with what i believe to be true, 
  how is it a `` gotcha '' moment to not know where you are ? 
  you mean the entirely appropriate security step of destroying a phone used for confidential purposes . 
  maybe i 've got super pneumonia induced parkinson 's affecting my memory but is n't that the opposite of the normal attack that she is n't security conscious enough ? 
  your link is as broken as your logic . 
  thank you so much for taking the time to do this ama . 
  how dangerous do you believe the lack of regulation around alternative medicine to be ? 
  do you think that the market is mostly full of products that are unlikely to help or harm or are there real reasons to be concerned that products sold as `` natural '' could have really sinister effects ? 
  what a shame that if he bankrupts the us his dad ca n't just buy poker chips to solve the problem .
