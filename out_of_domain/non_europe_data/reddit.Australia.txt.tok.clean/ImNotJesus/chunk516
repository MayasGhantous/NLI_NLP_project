  that 's why i get the guy who works at the corner store to fix my car , i 'm so sick of establishment mechanics telling me to replace my fan belt . 
  postus ? 
  and the trump faithful will vote for him no matter what . 
  who cares ? 
  trump has been appealing to the same 35-40 % of the country since the primaries and has n't for a second shown the ability to court more than that . 
  i 've heard he does like to grab under the hood to have a look . 
  we do n't see nearly enough non-establishment engineers . 
  of course . 
  just like their extremely genuine concern for the lgbtq community after the pulse bombing . 
  it 's just like when i watch sport and i know what every coach should be doing . 
  remind me when his favorability went noticeably over 40 . 
  how so ? 
  if only there was some sort of process where the accuracy of claims from both sides could be tester . 
  you know , like we get experts on the law to discuss what actually happened and then someone senior can `` judge '' what happened . 
  yes , yes , everything that does n't conform to your worldview is a conspiracy yada yada yada, 
  assange making grandiose claims about foreign actors without evidence ? 
  i 'm ** shocked ** . 
  how the hell could he possibly know that it was severed by a state actor ? 
  do n't forget that he 's literally on the run from rape charges . 
  he 's definitely not in bed with putin , he just seems to get his leaks from russia and have coincidentally similar political motivations . 
  is he though ? 
  i honestly think he 's an amoral opportunist . 
  i do n't mind the * idea * of wikileaks but he has never done it with a shred of ethical integrity . 
  they do n't even pretend to strip personal data anymore . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  maybe he saw a guy with an `` i 'm with the american state department '' t-shirt on ? 
  we need [ paul anka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slkao_pox5a ) to help us . 
  literally comments about `` seeing obama in prison in our lifetime '' with hundreds of upvotes . 
  the thing in most shocked about is assange recklessly acting without regard for truth or harm caused by it / s, 
  is there a piece of information you feel is inaccurate ? 
  imagine someone so lacking in alpha-ness ( totally a word ) that they need to physically assault women to get what they want . 
  what a sad , weak , disgusting person that would be . 
  some more fun to add to your quotes, 
  oh it 's very clear that there are attempts to [ rig the election ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_and_the_gop_are_openly_attacking_the_legitimacy_of_black_voting.html ) . 
  i think there 's pretty clear evidence of an [ attempt to rig the election ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_and_the_gop_are_openly_attacking_the_legitimacy_of_black_voting.html ) , it 's just not by the dems . 
  trump 's supporters really hate riggers do n't they . 
  this party is a trumpster fire . 
  why do you hate free speech , eagles and freedom ? 
  what a trumpster fire of a party . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8exub29z34 ), 
  maybe his 10 year old son helped with the cyber, 
   i 'm sure the admins are aware of all that . 
  they 've learned from fatpeoplehate and european . 
  the headache and irritation , and probable death threats , they 'd have to deal with if they shut down the_f\u00fcrher is n't worth it . 
  better to just ignore them . 
  except that the problem has become demonstrably worse by waiting . 
  months ago it was a fraction of the size but the admins never deal with anything until it 's * way * too late . 
  that video is a really tough watch . 
  this is a wonderful step in the right direction . 
  hopefully it can work towards healing a lot of wounds . 
  i 'd love to see her take congress , lord knows the gop congress deserves to lose their jobs , but i just do n't see it . 
  america is just too partisan and the swing too massive . 
  i really do n't buy it . 
  hillary is a phenomenal policy wonk and has had to deal with a mudslinging only campaign where people do n't even know what she stands for despite abundant brilliant policies . 
  none of this has played to her strengths, 
  well it would be closer because trump is the worst candidate in modern history , not much of a bar . 
  lest we forget that trump has made this entire election about mudslinging because ** he has no coherent policies ** . 
  his entire strategy is to bring hillary down to his level and claim that his lack of expertise and knowledge are better than the ( ( ( global powers ) ) ) who run the clintons . 
  trump is n't just a shitty person though , he 's a really shitty politician and has policies that range from stupid to morally abhorrent . 
  seriously , one of the defining moments of brexit was one of the key leave campaigners saying that the uk was [ `` sick of experts '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggigtjk7ma ) . 
  no they just fetishise the widely debunked la times poll, 
  yet people still ask `` why did n't these women come forward earlier ? '', 
  he has also shown an absolute inability to see women as anything other than objects . 
  like startlingly so . 
  think about how often his comments on women are about their physicality . 
   these people just do n't know when to shut the fuck up . 
  the profoundly depressing and telling thing is how much all of it reveals about how they actually see women . 
  let 's break this down because your statement is profoundly telling in so many ways, 
  let 's say that this is just `` virtue signalling '' - in your mind , you believe that celebrating the condemnation sexual assault is nauseating ? 
  how bizarre are your values ? 
  and why is virtue signalling something that you respond so strongly to ? 
  the fact that you see the strong reaction to his horrible , horrible words as only virtue signalling says something remarkable about how you feel about what he said . 
  do you not see any reason why reasonable people would call him disgusting without it being able projecting some image to a group ? 
  only because the code was `` cracked '' and it 's too obvious now . 
  it 's mostly used ironically to show where dogwhistling is being done . 
  right , to be more specific , he has no policies that show the slightest understanding of how foreign affairs or economics actually work . 
  he has goals , he just has no fucking idea how to get there . 
   i guess ecuador does n't like pissing off the future potus . 
  it 's not just that , they 're literally protecting someone interfering in a superpower 's election . 
  that 's not exactly a great foreign affairs move irrespective of who wins . 
  i have a lot of sympathy for snowden and manning - they 're whistleblowers who were in a really tough position and did what they thought was right . 
  assange is an amoral opportunist who is trying to leverage the indiscriminate and reckless release of unchecked personal information to avoid a rape trial . 
  that 's like movie villain shit . 
  he 's not a freedom fighter , he 's a disgusting person . 
  ca n't wait to see your evidence that they rigged anything . 
  i 'll wait here why you prove election fraud , go . 
  hypothetically , even if they did ( which there is no evidence of ) , why ** would n't ** they put diplomatic pressure on a country protecting a man meddling in foreign elections ? 
  you 'd think the more pressing surgery would be transplanting cruz a spine . 
  yeah , early days it was around a bit . 
  first time i saw it was when we had a jewish person doing an ama on / r/science . 
  a mod did some googling and we worked it out - after that i saw it used on t_d until it got covered in the media . 
  the ** democratic ** national convention internally discussed their preference for the democrat over the independent . 
  shocking . 
  now provide a single piece of evidence that they took any actions to `` rig '' the election . 
  so edgy !, 
  it 's not a maybe . 
  voter intimidation is a type of election rigging . 
  he 's specifically saying and doing things to stop people who do n't support him from voting . 
  that 's even before you consider things like racist voter id laws and gerrymandering . 
  here 's another [ good article ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_and_the_gop_are_openly_attacking_the_legitimacy_of_black_voting.html ) on the topic .
