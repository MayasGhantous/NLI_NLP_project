  pretending that that 's true , how does any of that relate to what i said ? 
  that 's one of the few things that i 've seen that were on the unethical side . 
  that being said , if it 's the worst thing the campaign did in a year they 've done pretty well . 
  that 's ... that 's not how paying off debt works . 
  if you have a large mortgage on your house it does n't get easier to pay it off if you lose your job . 
  you did n't say less government spending . 
  i 'm also not clear that cutting government spending is the best way to reduce debt . 
  austerity as a debt reduction strategy has been widely criticised . 
  it 's not a victory lap , she knows how hard it has been for obama to get anything done with such a hostile house/senate . 
  this is n't as good as taking the house as well but taking the senate will make it more possible to actually enact her vision . 
  right , we really want to make downballot republicans either condemn trump and take a hit from the 85 % of republicans who still support him or not condemn him and burn their bridges with anyone except uneducated white men . 
  well they 're coming very late in the race and are almost impossible to actually pass but i think both are good ideas . 
  that economic anxiety !, 
  poor little things , they 're not racist/homophobic/sexist / islamophobic , they 're suffering from the terrible disease * economic anxiety * that just makes you say/think/feel all of those things . 
  to be fair , was n't he technically impeached for perjury and not the affair ? 
  if you 've ever laughed at the term rape culture , i really hope you now see it . 
  this is what people mean when they talk about rape culture . 
  i did n't read this thing that i 'm commenting on but i 'm really sure that i 'm right . 
  mostly importantly i 'm ** really ** angry about it . 
  as a progressive man i 'm learning how badly i underestimated the problem, 
  i 'm still holding out hope he finds a way to lose texas . 
  or meddling with the american election . 
  it does n't matter if ecuador would want hillary or trump to win , it 's a ** terrible ** look for them if someone they 're protecting is trying to influence foreign elections . 
  sniiiiiiiiiiifff, 
  wrong . 
  only freedomtruthblog is safe !, 
  even putin gave up on trump after that debate . 
  quick unskew the fauxll, 
  the technical term is fauxll, 
  guy who was completely incompetent and out of control continued to be incompetent and out of control . 
  i am personally ** shocked ** . 
  and you 're saying he did n't get more stable after 9 women publicly accused him of sexual assault ? 
  what is the world coming to . 
  bleeding heart lefty here - i think it 's bad for democracy when republicans have a trainwreck of a nominee . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm really glad hillary will win and i think she 's going to do a fantastic job but conservative values deserve a better voice than that monster . 
  that 's what you say when you 've been taught your whole life that making money is the only measure of worth . 
  i think they were sour skittles . 
  think about the values daddy imparts . 
  no sense of civic duty , no sense of pride in taking care of others or making the world a better place . 
  no , the only way to measure self worth is through making money . 
   thats the scary part . 
  has n't changed since day 1 though . 
  he has consistently received 40 % of the vote . 
  he 's really , really good at rousing his base but has never done a thing to convince anyone outside of that base . 
  guy who was completely incompetent and out of control continued to be incompetent and out of control . 
  i am personally ** shocked ** . 
  and you 're saying he did n't get more stable after 9 women publicly accused him of sexual assault ? 
  what is the world coming to . 
  next you 're going to tell me that you need to be vaguely qualified to have the most important job in the world and that being a scumbag millionaire does n't suffice . 
  hey now , be fair . 
  he was up at 3 after a debate and did n't tell a single person to check out a sex tape of someone he was accused of denigrating . 
  that 's progress !, 
  i think you 're giving him way too much credit honestly, 
  he gave the money 17 months ago as well so it was n't even a political move . 
  does he not know what a foundation is supposed to do ? 
  at this point i 'm pretty sure snopes are just refreshing t_d to see what their next insane story to debunk is . 
   he lives in a carefully assembled bubble of tweets , sycophants , cocaine , and positive reaffirmations . 
  there is no vision in trump 's head where anything comes up other than sparkling victory . 
  anyone who says that he `` never wanted to win '' or this was all a plan to launch trump tv have n't been paying attention to the abundant clues about this man 's character or insight . 
  the guy is a monster . 
  ca n't remember . 
  must be having an aleppo moment, 
  seriously , if the best you have from 40 years in the public lie is a bit of gilding a personal experience and/or misremembering she must be a fucking saint . 
  if you 're anything but a white male you should be terrified that 40 % of the country will vote for someone who outwardly disdains you . 
  if you 're a white male who gives a fuck about equality you should be horrified too . 
   i mean no disrespect to sanders supporters , but when he started asking his followers to vote clinton , he was largely ignored . 
  that seems to be changing somewhat now though, 
  yeah that 's just not true . 
  something like 90 % are voting hillary and most of the rest were just anti-establishment votes and never would have voted hillary anyway . 
  fair . 
  that guy is a hideous monster . 
  sorry i should have specified straight and cis too, 
  so you have personally never exaggerated a story or misremembered an intense situation ? 
   separate from the lane closures , kelly testified that christie bullied her . 
  she broke down in tears twice on the stand friday describing christie 's reaction to a roundtable she set up in the aftermath of a fire in seaside heights . 
   `` he had a water bottle in his hand , and he said , ` what do you think i am , a f ** king game show host ? ', 
  and he threw the water bottle and i moved out of the way , '' kelly said . 
  i 've never seen the word `` trolls '' in a news headline and not cringed . 
  everyone has the right to their own opinions , people do n't have their own right to science . 
  the science is clear that being trans * is a natural variation in our species and there 's nothing inherently wrong or mentally ill about it . 
  every single respected psychology association says the same thing . 
  so while you can hold whatever opinions you like , those opinions do n't change the facts of the case . 
  that 's also not only true for matters of fact . 
  there are things that used to be considered morally okay that we now consider abhorrent . 
  history has certainly demonstrated this to us , where debates for people 's rights that seemed like mere differences of opinion at the time , now have clear `` incorrect '' sides ( e.g. 
  slavery , 19th amendment ) . 
  the people who are upset about the struggles trans * people face are often of the opinion that history will eventually show something similar for trans * issues . 
  i 'd also contend that some opinions are worthy of ridicule . 
  for example , if i were to make a racist comment you would be right to tear me down for doing so . 
  arguing with hateful opinions ( a ) spreads knowledge about what should/shouldn ' t be considered within the continuum of culturally accepted values ( e.g. , it 's okay to differ on conservatism but not on racism ) , ( b ) signals to members of marginalised groups that hate towards them wo n't be tolerated and ( c ) indicates to the person having those opinions that they will pay a social cost for expressing them . 
  you might not like those things but they all serve social purposes and i think you 'd agree with all of them if it were a context where the values were abhorrent to you . 
  while you are still personally entitled to hold any view you like , when you put them in a public space you are doing so in a way that allows others to respond . 
  your freedom of speech or freedom to hold whatever values you want , does n't deny others the freedom to respond to those values and judge you accordingly . 
  if you often find that your opinions are out of step with what other people think are reasonable , perhaps it 's an indication that you need to at least consider whether those are morally good values . 
  looks like op already gave you a great reference so i 'll just respond to this :, 
   the only thing i could argue with in your `` people ca n't argue with science '' is that 50 years ago 9 out 10 doctors recommended camel cigarettes , so the science can always change . 
  i do agree with you that all persons regardless of sexual orientation , or perceived gender should be protected and valued , i just want to read more about it . 
  sure , it 's entirely possible everyone is wrong . 
  nothing in science is set in stone and there 's nothing that * could n't * be overturned . 
  what i would say is that science is much better than it used to be .
