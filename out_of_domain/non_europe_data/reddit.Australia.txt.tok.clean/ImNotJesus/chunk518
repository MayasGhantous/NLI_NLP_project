  we 're not just more knowledgable than we used to be but we 're much better at knowing how to do science well ( even if there is a long way to go in perfecting it ) . 
  it 's also worth pointing out that while the edges of science get changed constantly , the odds of really well established theories being overturned is low . 
  obviously it 's not quite at this level but there 's so much evidence of evolution now that it would require a remarkable amount of evidence to show evolution as a whole to be wrong , instead we would refine small parts of the theory ( e.g. , relativity did n't prove gravity wrong , it improved our understanding of it ) . 
  in the same way , it seems very unlikely with the weight of the current evidence that we will ever revert to a 2 gender model of human psychology . 
  i 'm sure there will be lots of changes in how we define/study/understand gender but the odds of that being entirely overthrown are incredibly small because it would require so much to be wrong . 
  i have no idea what you 're actually arguing for . 
  what case are you trying to make here ? 
  you have a right to your opinions but freedom of speech does n't entitle you to immunity from those consequences . 
  that 's the whole point of freedom of speech . 
  you have the right to say what you want ( in public spaces ) and i have the right to judge you and respond as i see fit . 
  but , as others have pointed out . 
  this is a private website and if they wanted to ban anyone with an ` e ' in their username they can . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  i accept your right to have a different opinion but i do n't accept that some positions should be immune to criticism, 
  you say narrative , all of the scientists say science . 
  so hard to know who to believe, 
  go find me one respected scientific association , journal or university that agrees with you . 
  his point is that your personal discomfort has no relevance to the science of how other people should live their life . 
  i 'm amazed you can claim to have the science on your side when you do n't seem to know what science actually is . 
  its almost like you 're a bigot who is trying to use justify their own values by making claims you have no evidence to make . 
  but what would i know , i just actually study science instead of pretending to on the internet . 
  i 'll make it easy for you . 
  you 've claimed that all of the most respected relevant science associations are wrong and that the science is on your side . 
  by what evidence did you come to this conclusion ? 
  on what basis do you think it 's more likely that all of those experts are wrong than that you 're wrong ? 
  awesome . 
  let 's break this down . 
   for example , the mri 's on trans individuals showed only some parts of some areas of the brain are not related to the birth gender , they are in between . 
  this contradicts the scientific consensus that a trans person just has the opposite brain of the sex they were born as . 
  if we assume you are correctly interpreting this study , ** at best ** it says that gender is n't binary . 
  it tells us that trans * people have differences in their brain to cisgendered people , which is exactly what we would expect . 
  trans * people are n't just the exact opposite of their birth gender , it 's not quite that simple and i 'm not sure anyone claimed it is . 
  your conclusion is based on a faulty assumption . 
  on balance , i would say that those findings , as you 've described them , are actually in support of everything i 've read from the apa and other relevant bodies . 
   mostly on the basis of the evidence that 's been done not supporting what this supposed consensus is , one you have n't actually shown yet . 
  so you personally believe that in the few hours or few days you spent looking at people describing articles i 'm guessing you may not even have access to , you think that you 're qualified to make that claim ? 
  may i ask what formal training you have in neuroscience or psychology ? 
  because the far more parsimonious and likely conclusion is that you do n't know why you 're wrong and that ** all of the experts ** know more than you . 
  let me put it another way , your ideas sound really smart to you because you do n't know how wrong you are . 
  it 's the equivalent of sending a perpetual motion machine to a physicist or thinking that vaccines cause autism because you `` did your research '' . 
  at best you 're ignorant and too arrogant to accept it , at worst you 're an ideologue who has convinced himself that he 's much smarter than he is . 
  like really , just stop for one moment and consider the immense arrogance it takes for you , as someone with no formal training in any relevant field , to think you know more than people who have devoted their life to studying the topic . 
  it 's considered a science by every major university , journal and scientific body in the world . 
  by what evidence did you decide that it is n't a science and on what basis do you feel more qualified to make than claim than every relevant body ? 
  i really still have very little idea what you 're trying to say . 
   it 's just gentle ribbing, 
  you know locker room talk , when you tease your friends about their non-normative gender and struggle for rights by invalidating their very sense of self . 
  guy stuff . 
   definitely not what people expected to find . 
  it flies in the face of what people believed and expected , and still believe and expect . 
  in fact those studies found that homosexual 's brain more closely resembled the opposite gender than any trans individual . 
  what did they expect to find and how do you know ? 
  what brain differences specifically were they looking for and how that does differ from what was found in the study ? 
  even if it was different to what they were expecting , that does n't change that the results ( as you 've described them ) fit with the idea that trans * people have different brains to cisgendered people which seems to support them if anything . 
   `` man/woman in a woman/man 's body . '', 
  is the expression that came from this . 
  guessing by the number of times i 've seen this on reddit , and in lgbt forums ( for fucks sake ) , it seems to still be fairly commonplace . 
  it 's almost like your whole understanding of gender is from discussion in online forums and you do n't understand the nuance of non-binary gender and gender identity but that ca n't be true . 
  your claims suggest that you 're an expert in the topic . 
   there is n't an assumption on this point , what are you talking about ? 
  i have n't even made a claim outside of what the studies represented . 
  your conclusion was based on an assumption - if you had basic training in science it would be easier to explain this to you . 
  arguments are constructed with multiple premises leading to a conclusion . 
  your premise requires an assumption that anything besides an exact opposite brain would be evidence that being trans * is n't a real thing . 
  that 's a faulty premise and assumption . 
   none . 
  should i just refer you straight to the people my information and evidence comes from ? 
  they clearly have decades more experience than you . 
  please , you 're yet to provide a single drip of evidence that you know more than everyone else . 
   this is the rhetorical equivalent of `` nuh uh , my dad said so '' . 
  the best you 've done so far is appeal to some consensus you have yet to prove . 
  not in the slightest . 
  you 're making a claim of truth about the world and that claim of truth runs counter to established theory . 
  therefore , the onus is on you to provide positive evidence of an alternative theory . 
   condecension will get you everywhere but in my pants . 
  i do n't plan on getting int your pants but thanks for the offer . 
   so you are implying now that the research i 've provided is false or incorrect ? 
  except in this case the research i 've referenced is very accurate , as apparently confirmed by you . 
  you 've raised no issues with it . 
  if it were as poor as the `` vaccines cause autism '' research , i would assume you would bring some sort of evidence or argument to suggest that . 
  no i 'm saying that it 's more likely that ( similar to someone who believes they 've developed a perpetual motion machine or have proof that vaccines cause autism ) it is your very ignorance on the topic that obscures your ability to see that you 're wrong . 
   i 'm only as smart as the experts i 've referenced are . 
  if you would like to pick a bone with their qualifications , have at it . 
  what experts ? 
  stop making vague claims . 
   you 're right , i should know my place and not question what 's handed down from on high . 
  you definitely should n't assume that everything someone else tells you is correct . 
  you absolutely should assume that if you 're a person with no knowledge or training on a topic it 's ** more likely ** that you 're wrong than the overwhelming majority of experts . 
   to re-iterate for something like the 5th time now , you seem to be under the impression the argument is me against all of science , instead of mri scans vs your claims . 
  no , you do n't seem to understand that, 
  ( a ) a single study is n't enough to overturn theory, 
  ( b ) even in your probably biased recounting of the study it does n't provide any evidence for your claim, 
  ( c ) you simply do n't have the knowledge or training to make ** any ** of the claims you 're making . 
  you can be skeptical , you can say that you do n't understand but the arrogance of baldly stating that you know more because of a single study that you do n't even understand is galling . 
   i 'll admit , in spoken word your red herrings and appeals to authority might win over your audience . 
  i do n't know where i 've made a red herring but you should know that an appeal to authority is claiming that x is true simply because y authority believes it . 
  i 'm not saying that . 
  i 'm saying that it is ** more likely ** that people who have devoted their life to studying a topic and have reams of evidence you refuse to read are correct and you , a person who does n't have any formal training in neuroscience or gender . 
  i 'm genuinely astonished you do n't see the sheer arrogance of your position . 
  i would n't say they 're necessarily afraid of trans people but they are either profoundly ignorant , a bigot or both .
