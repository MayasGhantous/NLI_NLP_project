  i 'm arguing with the people i 'm arguing with for the others who will read it . 
  i know that there is n't a single thing i could say to convince you and that 's okay . 
   and that 's important , because most people in our society agree with me . 
  it is indeed sad and i will keep advocating for better publican understanding of science but more people believing in angels than evolution does n't make angels any more real or evolution less ( note : that 's an analogy since you do n't seem to notice them ) . 
  website is down . 
  please modmail if it goes back up, 
  now that i can click on it , it does n't look like this is peer reviewed research so it 'll have to stay down , sorry . 
  if you were on a date with someone , had a sip of your drink and woke up several hours later what would you think happened ? 
  there may or may not have been physical signs in their cases but i 'm asking as a blanket hypothetical . 
  i 've already replied that it 's not peer reviewed research so it has to stay down . 
  i 've seen it posted on t_d but it was also tweeted by michael cohen the `` what polls '' guy - [ link ] ( https://twitter.com/michaelcohen212/status/788398258070679553?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ), 
   trump , ali and parks were among 80 people honored at neco 's first awards ceremony on ellis island on oct. 27 , 1986 . 
  only four of the 80 winners were black . 
   in the original , uncropped version of the photo that cohen shared , there are six people : baseball legend joe dimaggio , humorist victor borge , singer and anti-gay activist anita bryant , ali , parks and trump . 
   since 1986 , more than 2,000 people have been awarded the ellis island medal of honor , including then-first lady hillary clinton and sen. john mccain ( r-ariz . ) . 
  officially , the medal criteria are broad and inclusive : winners should `` uphold the ideals and spirit of america , '' while `` maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage . '', 
  but he was endorsed by a guy on ice . 
  black people, 
  all of them, 
  [ quick , someone photoshop maga onto the hat ] ( http://www.therichestrappers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vanilla-ice-net-worth-2.jpg ), 
  to be fair , no one can avoid throwing their heart at jt, 
  which is clearly their plan right now . 
  they want downballot candidates either disavowing trump and pissing off their base or not and pissing off moderates/swings . 
  oh my god , thank you . 
  thank you so much . 
  i 've been desperately waiting for someone who just finished intro psych to finally speak truth to power on this and get us out from under the oppressive regime of the feminazi left . 
  i had to say all those things , there was one standing _ right behind me _ before . 
  i really do n't believe any of it but i have to argue for it on social media because they 'll kill my career otherwise . 
  you know the prophecies spoke of you ; finally the unbiased one will return balance to the psychology . 
  i still remember my master telling me of you `` edgy , he will be '' . 
  we 're just all so lucky that ** you ** , the guy who has done a small handful of psychology subjects and is clearly the only one immune to the biases that afflict us all , has come along to write the truly meaningful work . 
  because of course it 's not possible you 're wrong . 
  you 're a psychology student and you see all and know all about the field . 
  your in depth knowledge of what is good and bad for careers and what work does and does n't get published . 
  you read the inscription on our sacred texts `` do n't rock the boat '' and you now have perfect vision of all . 
  thank you for seeing that i only agree with almost every expert in the topic because i believe in the same sort of garbage because i , unlike you of course , allow my own personal opinions to pervade my mind . 
  ugggghhhhh , if only i could be you . 
  the only other possibility is that you 're wrong . 
  no , it could n't be , you appear to be the chosen one . 
  but maybe , maybe you are wrong . 
  it could n't be that you already had an opinion and when you read or heard about what the science says you disregarded it because of confirmation bias and concocted an elaborate conspiracy to justify why you are right and most of the people who know a lot more than you are wrong . 
  no , that 's just too simple . 
  it definitely could n't be that as an undergrad you greatly overestimate your own knowledge and understanding of complex phenomena because if that was a thing there would definitely be a name for that already . 
  maybe , just maybe , you 're not quite as smart as you think you are . 
  but if that were the case you probably would n't take this in anyway . 
  because if you were that sad , pathetic person that i think you might be you would read all of this and see it as confirmation that you hurt my feelings or won in some weird way instead of realising that your entire sense of smug superiority is built on a facade of being smarter than everyone else . 
  that would be far too threatening to your self of course because how else would you compensate for dad not caring enough without being an asshole to random strangers on the internet ? 
  no , no , better stick to pretending to know everything and calling people slurs because that 's truly how you break the shackles of those feelings that you 're desperately squishing down . 
   now he 's bringing out the big buns . 
  now that 's a political move we do n't need to see . 
  it has been done literally hundreds of times . 
  what are you on about ? 
  johnson 's poll is getting flaccid, 
  he loves poland and goes there to visit aleppo all the time . 
  ooo fun . 
  let 's play this one out . 
  lots of fun threads in your 4 comments but let 's do this one . 
   why do n't you do one the right way ? 
  what would be the right way ? 
  in your opinion , what flaw have you identified in the iq literature and how would you address that with a new study or series of studies ?

  ** lock him up , lock him up **, 
  you know , family values party stuff . 
  exactly what trump has been telling us all along . 
  the media are rigging the elections . 
  `` it 's a change election '', 
  yeah , changing republican states blue . 
  yeah but all guys do that, 
   i am not saying donald trump hates jews , but the thinly veiled anti-semantic dog whistling is only coming from supporters of one candidate . 
  i genuinely do n't think trump hates jews . 
  i think he 's far too stupid to know that the people who he likes to get his news and information from hate jews and parrots the information . 
  it 's also so shortsighted . 
  you know who does n't buy a new television and help grow businesses that sell televisions ? 
  people who ca n't afford food . 
  she also did n't take money from the saudis . 
  a foundation that she is on the board of took money from the saudis . 
  if it worked like this dingus thought the people running doctors without borders would owe a lot of political favors !, 
  they 've made it pretty clear in the past that guild hopping for raid rewards is n't okay so people doing it knew that they were doing the wrong thing . 
  it being possible to cheat does n't excuse people from cheating in my opinion . 
  perhaps that 's fair , you 've been around a lot longer than me and i was n't really aware of that . 
  i was more referring to when they fixed the system . 
  maybe we need some trickledown bootstraps to fix all these lazy poor people / s, 
  lets bury these assholes in the elections . 
  such a perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with the current crop of republicans in that video . 
  next you 're going to say that he does n't understand military strategy and his `` surprise attack '' strategy wo n't win the war . 
  are you saying that in 2016 it 's not okay for a `` news '' anchor to go on tv and tell the first black president to essentially `` go back to africa '' ? 
  where 's the racism ? 
  that 's pc culture gone mad !,
