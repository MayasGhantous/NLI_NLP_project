   it might violate the geneva convention, 
  like most of trump 's other ideas . 
  just imagine the sheer arrogance of someone to think that no military expert has every thought about a surprise attack before him . 
  i ca n't even comprehend how a brain like that would work . 
  it 's just a ~ ~ prank ~ ~ metaphor bro, 
  maybe it is a `` change '' election ; changing red states blue . 
  as someone who was instantly outraged and wanted comey 's head , [ this explanation ] ( https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/792120000773431296 ) made a lot of sense to me ( make sure to click through to see replies ) . 
  basically , if the e-mails were uncovered in the investigation of the weiner case , there may not be a court order allowing them to open them . 
  if they intend to get a court order to do so ( which is reasonable ) , it would be very difficult for that not to leak and seem like comey was hiding things . 
  the reason he was vague is that ( in theory ) no one should have read those e-mails if they 're not pertinent to weiner 's case .

  3 new e-mails , that were likely already turned over and no indication that there was any intel . 
  what a story !, 
  just imagine the sheer arrogance of someone to think that no military expert has every thought about a surprise attack before him . 
  i ca n't even comprehend how a brain like that would work . 
  tell me more armchair quarterback , what strategies * should * they use and what do you base that idea on ? 
   you 'd think at a certain point that people would get wise to the scheme , but , no , it keeps working . 
  it gets clicks/viewers so why would the media stop ? 
  it riles up the base and distracts them from how ghastly they actually are so why would the gop stop ? 
  because each feeds into the next . 
  she now has an air of untrustworthiness about her so the next scandal confirms the previous one . 
  it 's so weird that i 've never heard him call any white protesters `` thugs '' . 
  so , so weird . 
  did you guys hear something ? 
  my dog is going crazy . 
  are you a rigger ? 
  because he really hates riggers . 
  they 're just experiencing economic anxiety !, 
  it 's not their fault , it 's a horrible disease that makes them say and do racist , sexist and homophobic things, 
  ooo maybe we 'll get another james o'keefe video that definitely is n't edited out of context . 
  for a group of people who are so obsessed with conspiracies you would think that you care that the trump foundation donated a large amount of money to project veritas or that breitbart paid whatshisname black to disrupt the primaries and film it . 
  unless , of course , you only care about while conspiracies that confirm your already held beliefs because you do n't actually are about the truth you just care about circlejerking about how much you hate hillary . 
  could n't be though . 
   disallowed submissions, 
   us internal news/us politics, 
  it 's literally the first point of the first rule on the sidebar . 
  former [ doj spokesman ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/2016/10/former-doj-spokesman-loses-it-over-new-fbi-probe-comey-flagrantly-violated-doj-rules/ ) disagrees with you . 
  i agree the media ** have ** been irresponsible in how they covered this story for the first couple of hours . 
  luckily we 're seeing better coverage since . 
  glad we found some common ground . 
   in trying to strike that balance , in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season , there is significant risk of being misunderstood, 
  so i 'll be as vague as possible and i 'm sure no one will run away with the story . 
  thank god he spent all that campaign money launching his new hotel . 
  will the personal profit outweigh the massive damage done to his brand ? 
  hypothetically , if a group of muslims took over federal land with assault rifles demanding a change in federal law how do you think the situation would end ? 
  what do you think the odds of them making it out of the shootout ? 
  did n't lebron get a 50-10-10 at msg and then they stripped a rebound on replay ? 
   if that group had all the same situations as this group ? 
  hopefully similar . 
  yes i would hope so too . 
  do you ** really ** , in your heart of hearts believe that it would be though ? 
  really truly deep down if you ask yourself honestly whether the police would treat them the same or their trial would go the same or the people who campaigned for them to be released would be the same or whether the media narratives would be the same , what do you come up with ? 
  the important part of the story is not that she was a trump supporter though , it 's that in person voter fraud does n't happen because it 's really easy to catch people . 
  you did n't answer my question though . 
  as a penis haver who is happily married and has never considered cheating or using it inappropriately - rest assured that it says far more about the person using it than having a penis itself . 
  i think for them it 's more about power/domination than just getting off . 
  ugh , those thugs in the ghetto are a bunch of riggers . 
  pretty sure my dog just went deaf . 
  from other tweets immediately following ... 
   if comey does n't get ahead of this , going to have a mutiny at @fbi . 
  `` this is why u say ` we dont talk about investigations ' '' one told me ... 
   ... his original decision to lay out info on clinton case , then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings , infuriated these folks . . 
   ... to begin with , because it was inappropriate precedent set . 
  then it set him up for what he did today , and because he knew how angry ... 
   ... people inside were with him , he was trying to play to two audiences -- updating his testimony while not revealing too much . 
  but that ... 
   ... just made everything worse . 
  edit : this is his full ( and very good ) article on today - http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-comey-donald-trump-anthony-weiner-huma-abedin-514918, 
  there goes me , thinking with my dick and missing that one . 
  no , i just needed the joke womansplained to me . 
  here 's the [ full - about to be pulitzer prize winning - article ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html ) . 
  as a progressive `` sjw '' ( since caring about groups other my own makes me a monster ) , i 've been blown away by watching in real time what all my female friends and family are telling me they 've experienced their whole life . 
  and i literally say this as a psychologist who studies prejudice . 
  the funny thing is , is that if mras like you stopped screaming at how horrible feminists are for 5 minutes you 'd realise that you actually share a lot of goals . 
  do you really think * most * feminists are cheering for the rape of men in prison ? 
  what you 're missing is that some of the biggest mens right 's issues ( e.g. , suicide rates due to masculine norms that make it not okay for men to seek emotional help ) will be worked towards if feminists are successful . 
  but i guess it 's more fun to be angry . 
  can you point me to a single pediatrician publishing work on the health of adults ? 
  do n't you hate cardiologists who are organist against livers ? 
  it 's almost like people specialise in certain issues and we do n't need to assume they hate not x , just because they fight for x. 
  yes i 'm sure your three examples from tumblr are all * terrible * people, 
  yup . 
  i made my point , no sense in trying to convince ideologues . 
  they 're just experiencing economic anxiety !, 
  it 's not their fault , it 's a horrible disease that makes them say and do racist , sexist , anti-semitic and homophobic things, 
  they 're just experiencing economic anxiety !, 
  it 's not their fault , it 's a horrible disease that makes them say and do racist , sexist , anti-semitic and homophobic things, 
  i ca n't imagine how a nativist could seize economic anxiety to demonise outgroups and any media who disagrees, 
  sorry - first time posting here and it seemed to fit the type of content i normally browse but i apologise if it missed the mark . 
  keep up the awesome work , this is a great community . 
  as a person who ca n't think of a single reason to care about groups other than your own except for wanting to look good to strangers on the internet , i 'm concerned you lack fundamental human emotions . 
  how so ? 
  i heard he was supposed to play a game of civilzation but dodged it . 
  in the basement . 
  your mom 's basement . 
  not to mention that despite being the most corrupt person of all time she has managed to evade any criminal wrongdoing for 3 decades . 
  if she 's that good , imagine what she would do for the country .
