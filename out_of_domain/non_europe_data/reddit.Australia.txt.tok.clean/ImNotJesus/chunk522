   he probably felt in light of what he did before , he had to bring this out . 
  quite frankly -- because he had done the press conference and all the things he had before -- he probably did have to send a letter to congress like he did last week , '' he added . 
  `` but i would argue all of this has been wrong from the get-go in the way it 's been handled . 
   the agency tasked with judging other people 's information security practices has sure leaked a thing or two in the past 48 hours .

  i missed rewards, 
   as mr. ulukaya has stepped up his advocacy -- employing more than 300 refugees in his factories , starting a foundation to help migrants , and traveling to the greek island of lesbos to witness the crisis firsthand -- he and his company have been targeted with racist attacks on social media and conspiratorial articles on websites including breitbart news . 
  nothing says privilege like being willing to `` blow up the system '' to send a message . 
  it says pretty loudly that your rights are n't under threat . 
  hypothetically , even if there was actual proof that the dnc acted to swing the election for hillary , how would that affect ** her ** character . 
  would n't that necessitate proof that she wanted/asked for it ? 
  huh ? 
  do you know what the dnc is ? 
  the article never claims otherwise . 
  it just says that him campaigning about being transparent does n't match his business practices - even before you consider his medical records and tax records that he refused to release . 
  please provide a link to the paper itself - linking to the journal on phys.org does n't show us which paper is being referenced .

   despite all the press the national tracking polls are getting , the state level polls are still clearly showing that donnie is totally fucked . 
  yup show me one path to victory that does n't include penn for trump . 
  yup . 
  trump 's misogyny is just bringing it all to the fore so let 's not pretend that gender has played no role in this election . 
  the party of trump [ ** hates women ** ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/23/how-sexism-drives-support-for-donald-trump/ ) . 
  of all the terms to use , of course it was one that refers to a woman 's genitalia . 
  if only it was just him . 
  let 's not forget that attitudes towards women are a better predictor than [ authoritarianism , ethnocentrism and anxiety about economic stagnation ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/23/how-sexism-drives-support-for-donald-trump/ ) of support for trump . 
  america has a sexism problem and trump is just too dumb to use the usual gop dogwhistles . 
  are we still pretending gender is n't a factor in many people 's disliking of hillary ? 
  i believe he has a financial stake in the company making it so probably not . 
  country before party . 
  like a grown up . 
  hi sweaty_pete , your post has been removed because :,

  please contact the mods if you need further assistance, 
  that 's a great question . 
  there are a few different approaches and it really depends on the type of measure , your theoretical perspective and how much effort you want to go to . 
  i think the gold standard is generally a data driven approach which involves starting with a really large number of items that you test and retest to see how well they fit together . 
  for example , the first proper personality inventory ( the big five ) was created by going through the dictionary and finding every adjective that people use for humans . 
  they then had participants rate themselves with those adjectives and use factor analysis to see which of those adjectives hung together to create relevant subscales . 
  in the end , they found that there were 5 statistically coherent categories and picked the items that statistically best represented those subscales . 
  on the other hand , if you 're making something small for a quick study you might just create something `` face valid '' , which basically means that on the surface it seems to measure what you think it 's measuring . 
  a data driven approach can take a huge amount of time and money so if you 're wanting to measure something more simple you can try to just come up with items based on theory . 
  in that case you would normally then test your results to see whether those items are reliably a part of the same construct ( using cronbach 's alpha and/or a factor analysis ) . 
  to further complicate this issue , almost all mental illness symptoms are extreme ends on normal continua . 
  for example , it 's totally normal and fine to experience sadness sometimes . 
  if you experience significant sadness very often , it 's depression . 
   just a cool piece of history , i still find it hard to believe that such an insanely stupid hypothesis led to what we now see a whole range of people taking very seriously today . 
  and the big five is one of the most studied and valid questionnaires int he world now . 
  great example of why science is n't about getting it right the first time always . 
  it 's a constant gradual process of refining , not huge homerun hits . 
  how would you test traits in a naturalistic setting ? 
  fleeson has done work looking at frequency of extraverted behaviour over time and it has very good reliability and related to big 5 measures, 
  what specifically ? 
  there 's a huge amount of large scale and cross cultural work on the big 5 . 
  do you have a reference ? 
  right well one of the ways to judge self report measures is how they predict behavioural outcomes . 
  that is done all the time . 
  great question . 
  there could be some lists but i do n't know of any . 
  but to answer your question , there are certainly some best practice methods to improve reliability and accuracy of questionnaires . 
  it really depends on the nature of the construct . 
  it 's generally useful of things are normally distributed but some things are n't and that 's okay . 
  psychological distress is positively skewed because most people do n't experience a lot of it while happiness is negatively skewed because most people rate themselves as happy . 
  the skew itself is a form of information because it tells us what the population is like and helps to define a normative range . 
  / u/fsmpastafarian can give a better response for that . 
  i 'm really not sure what you 're asking . 
  but how do we know what they relate to without getting self-report ? 
  the brain does a lot of things !, 
  there 's a difference between the science * of * the subjective and subjective science . 
  if you score 7/10 on a scale your score is objectively 7/10 . 
  we can argue about whether there is error in how well that maps onto your subjective experience but the score itself is an objective measure . 
   clearly you do n't know the parameters that define science ... 
  and what are those parameters by your estimation ? 
  and in what way do you think most psych studies are n't `` rigorously testable '' . 
  virtually all studies ( excluding reviews ) have clearly stated hypotheses , data collection and analysis . 
  what is the field as a whole missing ? 
  what issue of validity do you have with the big 5 ? 
   i 've only done a year of psych, 
  and in your now clearly expert opinion , why do you think nature , science , the nih , every respected university in the world etc. 
  call it a science but you do n't ? 
  do you believe that essentially every relevant body is biased or do you think you have access to information or logic that they do n't ? 
  you still have n't told me about any specific concerns you have with the big 5 . 
  so , to be clear , i do n't think the big five is a perfect model - nor is any trait taxonomy . 
  i do however resist vague and unsubstantiated criticism of a very important model . 
  personally , i 'm more of a fan of the bfas and i think deyoung 's recent work on the cybernetic model is really cool ( even though i hate the name ) . 
  do n't forget the wall and the fact that he believes having parents who are mexican disqualifies you from being a judge . 
  i think this all assumes that the civil war breaks towards the old guard which i do n't personally believe . 
  there 's no just pretending this did n't happen and reverting back to the cutting taxes and welfare party . 
  literally, 
  breaking news : campaign discusses strategies that work with young voters . 
  perhaps we need a wall on the slovenian border, 
  opposition to letting non-white people vote is trump 's most orthodox gop position . 
   it knocked a few percentage points off her mandate,
