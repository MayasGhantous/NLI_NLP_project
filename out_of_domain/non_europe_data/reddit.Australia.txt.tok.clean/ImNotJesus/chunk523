  fwiw that 's not actually a real thing . 
  because dog whistles are so 2000s, 
  you 'd think the candy inside it would tip him off . 
  for someone who thinks that facts matter you have a very tenuous grasp of reality . 
  when all you 've got is conspiracies and racism it does n't leave you with much else to talk about . 
  hillary did n't say no to donations to a charity that saves lives . 
  trump sought out business opportunities with them . 
  one of these things is n't like the other . 
  a foundation that shares her name did n't say no to money from people that are in a country that has terrorists . 
  what a scandal !, 
  so what ? 
  well , she 's not . 
  a foundation that shares her name and uses the money to save lives receives donations from a foreign government . 
  also , no . 
  you poor oppressed little thing . 
   these are questions of fact , that should be based on evidence . 
  he 's also demonstrably wrong . 
  this has already happened in mexico and many studies have shown that it worked very well . 
   the mods ca n't stop free speech . 
  racism is ( unfortunately ) free speech . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png ), 
  we can and do ban hate speech on this subreddit ( source : am a mod here , wrote the rule we added to ban users who use hate speech ) . 
  if you see any , report it . 
  yes . 
  the article is referring to sex . 
  like they 've left the house before . 
   ethnic identification . 
  ethnic identification was assessed with the four-item identity centrality scale ( luhtanen & crocker , 1992 ; \u03b1 = .91 ) . 
  participants indicated agreement with items such as `` the ethnic group i belong to is an important reflection of who i am . '' on a 7-point scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 7 = strongly agree ) . 
  nothing because the study was on white people . 
  presumably that 's a different mechanism . 
  the rate at which his entire campaign is being whitewashed as economic populism is fucking insane . 
  in that case reminding you of the increasing minority population in america would be unlikely to make you worried about the status of whites . 
   well , yeah . 
  if the arab world was facing the same change in demographics i 'd imagine we 'd be witnessing the same phenomenon there . 
  or anywhere else in the world , quite frankly . 
  that 's possibly true but also an empirical question . 
  i guess the implication of your comment though is that doing so is normal and fine . 
  it 's worth pointing out that the aim of science is n't to judge people , just to accurately describe the world as it is . 
  so the implication of this is n't that strongly identifying by your whtieness is bad , just that it has certain implications and is possibly related to the election result . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  do n't be snarky , what if we were going to learn something in the 15th month of coverage that we did n't in the first 14 ? 
   would we see similar results if the same was happening in mexico ? 
  if white or blacks were becoming the dominate population ? 
  i have n't seen any data but based on the theory presented in this paper i think the authors would argue yes . 
  specifically , this paper is n't trying to say that white people are racist because they 're white , it 's that they identify the country as being white and so any shift away from that feels threatening to their group identity . 
  that item did n't relate to specific ethnic groups and i ca n't see anywhere else that they looked at it from a brief skim . 
  right . 
  the aim of this study is n't to demonise white people , it 's to help our understanding of this phenomenon . 
  ingroup bias is very much the norm . 
  if you want a society where that does n't happen , it takes constant and external pressure to do so . 
  also worth pointing out that the aim of the study is n't to demonise white people . 
  ingroup bias is the norm and we know that people are biased towards their group based on tiny differences . 
  it 's important to make sure we understand ** where ** bias is affecting us and take steps to correct it .

  how would they do the same study with a different majority ethnic group in america ? 
  only if your aim is to understand all of prejudice in a single study . 
  the aim of this study was to look at a specific population and a specific phenomenon . 
  well if you do n't like the way people write about the project - do n't fucking read what people write about the project . 
  is it really that hard to understand ? 
  very possible . 
  not sure if it has been done but probably worth a study .

  in-group bias generally ? 
  probably not . 
  implicit and explicit racism you can certainly reduce it a lot .

  i have that user tagged as [ css thief ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking/comments/2hvg0x/rcooking_gets_css/ ), 
  because they 're a hate group . 
  i 'm totally fine with a community talking about trump . 
  i 'm not fine with a hate sub . 
  editt : [ some examples ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/5bp4a3/i_have_been_collecting_examples_of_hatred_from/ ), 
  few people have harassed the admins more about this than me , it 's not happening . 
  sorry to burst bubbles but they have no plans to ban them any time soon . 
  not based on what admins have said to me today . 
  same guy asked for a mod position on a tiny sub in exchange for giving them a new css which he promptly copy-pasted from askreddit . 
  - [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking/comments/2hvg0x/rcooking_gets_css/ ) . 
  best part being that reddit 's code changed a few months ago so instead of being able to fix the css himself the whole sub just entirely removed custom sheets - [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking/comments/54tftx/css_issues/ ) . 
  honestly , you 're the dick in this story and i say this as someone who has never been within a mile of that subreddit . 
  they 're mourning the loss of someone and you go onto their subreddit to try and shit on them , acting incredulous when it happens . 
  think what you want to think but you literally set out to upset other people and then when it happened pretended like you 're some innocent victim . 
  grow up . 
  sure it will . 
  if you 're 50 + and rich you wo n't see a single consequence yourself . 
  hi claudia-sofia-j , your post has been removed because :, 
  this topic is n't suitable for / r/iama . 
  try posting in [ / r/casualiama ] ( http://reddit.com/r/casualiama ) instead . 
  please contact the mods if you need further assistance, 
  what do you base that projection on ? 
  there 's not really good empirical evidence to show that yet . 
  it 's great that there are trials but you should try to divorce your views of mdma from the actual science .
