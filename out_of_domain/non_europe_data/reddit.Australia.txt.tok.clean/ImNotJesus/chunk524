  there are lots of anecdotes that astrology totally predicted my future . 
  anecdotes and science are distinct . 
  yeah and when i go to my tarot reader it 's a super controlled setting !, 
  my tarot reader definitely is n't biased towards tarot working well so any anecdotes i hear from her are untirely unbiased . 
  nope . 
  i 'm just a scientist who cares about empirical research not being conflated with ideological pushes to medicalise recreational drugs as a backdoor into legalisation . 
  i 'm very much pro weed being legal , i 'm very much against bad science being pushed to pretend it 's some miraculous cure-all . 
  same goes with mdma . 
  different questions . 
  bad regulations mean that it has n't been tested enough . 
  i oppose that . 
  i do n't support giving untested medicine to people whatever it is . 
  it 's a cop-out that scientific evidence should be a precursor to using things as medicine ? 
  it 's not going anywhere because you ignore what i say in an effort to maintain indignant . 
  let me ask you then ; what do you think the criteria should be before something can be prescribed as a medicine ? 
  if you were in charge , where would you set the bar ? 
  maps do a lot of things that make me very uncomfortable like parading study subjects as advocates . 
  i never said you were ... 
  either way , can you link to some published papers for me ? 
  played for a month to get the feel for it , then made two different free to play accounts in the two following months . 
  both regularly go # 1 in arena . 
  it 's all about making a plan and being efficient . 
  start fresh .

   because moderate white people do n't all share a doctrine that calls for inequality and violence against everyone else . 
  there 's sufficient justification in the bible to do just about anything mandated in the koran . 
  if you think muslim extremism is n't the result of sociopolitical issues and not some innate `` badness '' of islam you need to buy a history book .

  amazing they managed to get a photo of the average mra 's girlfriend for the aritcle thumbnail too, 
  i care about male issues . 
  i 've just never met an mra that cares more about male issues than their disdain for women . 
  nice to meet you too .

  make sure at least 1000 of those words are on which boxers from the 30s they each best resemble . 
  the thing that scares me is that he is n't smart or well informed enough to know that this is what russia would want . 
  that means he 's getting the info from somewhere . 
  now we ca n't know whether he 's getting instructions straight from russia or someone like flynn has his ear but either putin or someone very close to him is telling him what to say . 
  surely this will improve the lives of rural whites . 
  i 'm sure trump will tweet any minute with his plan to stop them at all costs . 
  i 'm sure trump will tweet shortly with his plan to `` work this all out '', 
  they should be scared of a social cost for presenting racist views . 
  their political arm is actually excellent . 
  therein lies the problem , flynn is clearly the go-between . 
  i just love the idea that soros ( obviously it has to be a jew ) spent millions setting up an elaborate illegal voting system that no one can find traces of to ... run up the score in california and ny ? 
  did no one think to send any illegal voters to michigan or pennsylvania ? 
  curious to know what power analysis tool you used to get such a large sample . 
  also , how can you know the sample required without seeing the type of analyses done ? 
  right but my point is that sample sizes do n't exist in a vacuum . 
  it 's good to have a big enough sample but a sample of over 1,000 is entirely excessive for most things . 
  how so ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  yeah i mean you can get angry about wanting a big sample but you ( a ) did n't bother to look at what the sample size is and ( b ) do n't seem to know how one would derive what an appropriate sample is . 
  it 's also probably worth pointing out that the `` humans are complicated '' probably is n't as much of a revelation to psychologists as you seem to think it is . 
  when you 're experimenting on humans you actually have an ethical responsibility to not get too big a sample for no reason because all studies contain risk , especially studies on big issues like this . 
  to have a bigger sample just to satisfy online commentators who do n't know what a power analysis is would actually be obscenely unethical, 
  how are you defining a `` stasticially safe sample size '' and how would you calculate that here ?
