  if you feel like you ca n't enjoy / r/science without a sprinkling of racism , you are more than welcome to create your own , new , racist science subreddit . 
  as far as i know i 'm not being cuckolded but i appreciate the sincere concern . 
  so there 's a massive literature on stereotypes and why they matter for judgments we make . 
  for example , we know that women who are seen as likeable are generally seen as incompetent and women who are competent are generally seen us unlikeable , especially in a role where they hold power . 
  understanding the types of stereotypes that exist and how they impact on judgement is * really * important and what this work is trying to do . 
  the problem is when you start making claims that imply x group acted in a way that they deserve said stereotype . 
  if i said that women who are nice tend to be shit at their jobs and therefore the stereotype is valid , that would be really offensive . 
  also , if anything , this study gives us a really good glimpse into ** why ** crime rate differences exist , since there 's far more reason to blame non-genetic differences . 
  for example , we know that black and white americans smoke weed at very similar rates but blacks are 4x more likely to end up in prison for it . 
  yep . 
  nuance matters . 
  we are n't banning any data , we are banning users who misuse data to promote a racist agenda . 
  no and we certainly are n't banning anyone who mentions crime rates , they matter both as an iv and dv when thinking about this issue . 
  but , people are responsible for their words and they do n't exist in a vacuum . 
  nuance matters . 
  well , if you feel like it needs to be said i 'm happy to explicitly state that the mod team are against all forms of racism . 
  thanks for asking the questions !, 
  thanks !, 
  care to clarify what you think i missed ? 
  well i 'm not sure how they would know it 's dealt with less harshly since they ca n't see who we ban . 
  please feel free to report any racism you see though . 
  it 's literally not . 
  reddit , where saying `` be slightly less racist '' is controversial . 
  of course i do n't mind !, 
  how so ? 
  yeah that 's not how words work . 
  there 's lots of great discussion happening too . 
  we always try to stop the assholes ruining the learning for everyone else if we can . 
  i was giving some examples and have now linked to a longer discussion . 
  it 's difficult to know in advance which will be the parts that need further explanation . 
  you 're literally replying to a psychologist in a post about psychology . 
  correct . 
  we censor racism in / r/science . 
  if you feel like you ca n't enjoy reading about science without racism sprinkled in you are welcome to create your own racism-friendly science subreddit . 
  back off , i 'm taken . 
  that seems like a mutually beneficial decision . 
  so it 's my wife that needs to worry about being a cuck, 
  yep , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  well done . 
  do you have a science degree ? 
  sorry the whole mod team have at least a bachelors . 
  appreciate the interest though . 
  you can absolutely discuss any statistics , as long as they are accurate and the ** discussion ** of them is n't thinly veiled racism .

  typical powertripping mod, 
  the vast majority of papers are unfortunately behind paywalls . 
  i could n't find a good summary so i linked the abstract .

  aghababaei , wasserman , & nannini , 2014 and saroglou , pichon , trompette , verschueren , & dernelle , 2005 both look at religiosity and hexaco . 
  what were you hoping for in particular ? 
  speaking of getting conspiracies started , did you hear all the talk about hannity and cats ? 
  unless you 're a `` thug '', 
  i run rex , dt , dn , zarriss , gk and regularly finish # 1 . 
  it 's really nice . 
  i tried exactly that ( without the zeta ) and dropped similarly overnight but struggled more on offence . 
  r/everythingscience is the sister subreddit to r/science !, 
  we welcome all forms of new scientific content ( apart from videos ) regardless of if it 's peer-reviewed research or not . 
  yes , anecdotal stories are welcome . 
  think of it as the after party to r/science . 
  for example , this post is full of deleted comments because we have high standard for comments in / r/science . 
  the same discussion in / r/everythingscience is less curated and thus open to anecdotes and the like . 
  high openness to experience correlates with being liberal . 
  not sure about religiosity off the top of my head but i assume it relates to irreligiosity . 
  edit : very small negative correlation with religiosity , slightly bigger negative correlation with religious fundamentalism . 
  sources - [ religiosity ] ( https://cdn.uclouvain.be/public/exports%20reddot/psyreli/documents/2002.paid.relibfive.pdf?spncategory=525&amp;spndomain=17&amp;spncontent=23&amp;spncontent=28&amp;spnid=41022 ), 
  and [ conservatism ] ( http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/jost.glaser.political-conservatism-as-motivated-social-cog.pdf ), 
  this was posted to promote some of the fine content we have on everythingscience . 
  most people do n't open comments sections , 90 something percent iirc . 
  everythingscience has more lax posting and commenting rules . 
  essentially , it 's a place for more casual discussion of science . 
  a little outside my area but if i remember correctly it 's about 50/50 nature/nurture . 
  as mentioned in the last paragraph there is also some new research showing that openness can be increased . 
  technically his work does n't look at personality characteristics but wrongness judgment of different types of moral violations but it 's related and very interesting . 
  actually , [ that was different ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/dressgate-why-we-lost-our-minds-over-a-dress-20150227-13r5bs.html ) . 
  no , i 'm basing that on the research that shows a .3 correlation . 
  religiosity -,

  conservatism - [ link ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34149497/jost_et_al._2003_political_conservatism_as_motivated_social_cognition.pdf?awsaccesskeyid=akiaiwowyygz2y53ul3a&amp;expires=1496124411&amp;signature=6%2bs%2bzmig%2fokjftnkhn1ic4uwdbq%3d&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3b%20filename%3dpolitical_conservatism_as_motivated_soci.pdf ), 
  no the mbti is all about making vague horoscope-like descriptions feel sciencey . 
   there is mounting evidence that personality is malleable , and increases in openness have been observed in cognitive training interventions and studies of the effects of psilocybin ( the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms ) . 
  from the linked article . 
  nope , that 's what it means . 
  there are always exceptions . 
  oh god . 
  wow . 
  just above average for social or personality psychology . 
  did you look at the reference in the same comment ?
