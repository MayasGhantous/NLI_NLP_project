   users online tend to focus on specific narratives and select information adhering to their system of beliefs . 
  such a polarized environment might foster the proliferation of false claims . 
  indeed , misinformation is pervasive and really difficult to correct . 
  to smooth the proliferation of unsubstantiated rumors major corporations such as facebook and google are studying specific solutions . 
  indeed , examining the effectiveness of online debunking campaigns is crucial for understanding the processes and mechanisms behind misinformation spreading . 
  in this work we show the existence of social echo chambers around different narratives on facebook in the us . 
  two well-formed and highly segregated communities exist around conspiracy and scientific topics -- i.e. , users are mainly active in only one category . 
  furthermore , by focusing on users interactions with respect to their preferred content , we find similarities in the way in which both forms of content are consumed . 
   our findings show that debunking posts remain mainly confined within the scientific echo chamber and only few users usually exposed to unsubstantiated claims actively interact with the corrections . 
  dissenting information is mainly ignored and , if we look at the sentiment expressed by users in their comments , we find a rather negative environment . 
  furthermore we show that the few users from the conspiracy echo chamber who interact with the debunking posts manifest a higher tendency to comment , in general . 
  however , if we look at their commenting and liking rate -- i.e. , the daily number of comments and likes -- we find that their activity in the conspiracy echo chamber increases after the interaction .

  the post is more of a summary of a few studies than an individual new finding . 
  meta-analyses are fine as they are new research in and of themselves . 
  just not review work .

   just what the rogue one squad needs , more synergy ... 
  because people are clamouring for that k2 and cassian squad ? 
  [ link to a preprint of the full paper ] ( https://psyarxiv.com/m53y7 ), 
  i added a link to the full paper as a separate comment . 
  careful with all that edge dude , you almost nicked me . 
  i miss the days of arguing about substantive conservative economic policy . 
  modern australian and american conservatism is just white christian identity politics and invoking culture wars . 
  tell them that the dirty lefties are ruining the country and you wo n't notice while we privatise telstra . 
  i 've been running a version of this for a few months now - not boring . 
  i have han in the spot where r2 is there . 
  i definitely kill people outside of annihilate , especially with 2 different full team assists . 
  i 've been thinking about dropping thrawn for cl or leia . 
  how do you like it ? 
  so it 's gk , zarriss , rhan , dn , leia ? 
  does her zeta help much ? 
  disagree on nihilus - he gets a big prot boost going from xi to xii . 
  all of those voters whose core issue was email server management must be really regretting their vote now that trump is using an unsecured phone to talk national security with someone / / / / / / / / s, 
  why ? 
   we 'll redo our home kitchen next year and i 'll be going for a four burner induction plate next to a double gas plate . 
  if i really had to choose one it would be induction . 
  in what situation would you use one cooker or the other ? 
  they 're a bunch of cunts and you deserve better . 
  being pro equality is more than just being anti-inequality . 
  you have to actually want change and do your part . 
  you * could * dip your hat to our strong banking regulations or you could agree with the series of nobel prize winning economists who said it was the stimulus package . 
  i 'm pretty sure the only way to manage an economy is to sell off assets and then pretend that all that matters is a surplus . 
   honey i lost 5k gambling today but i sold the car for 10k which means we 're in the black !, 
  stiglitz did n't get a nobel prize for praising wayne swan you donkey . 
  if you 're going to make silly accusations at least make ones that follow logically from what i said . 
  if your position is that we can tell nothing of the quality of an economist who won a nobel prize because one time a politician was given a symbolic peace prize , i do n't feel the need to argue with you at all . 
  have a nice day . 
  is n't he by definition at some point going to be an ex-president ? 
  thanks for doing this ama on such an important topic . 
  one element of suicidality there 's a lot of confusion about is suicidal ideation . 
  i was wondering if you could speak a little about the different types of suicidal thoughts people may have and how indicative they are of risk . 
  are all thoughts of suicide the same ? 
  you can quantitatively measure subjective things . 
  have you tried krennic lead ? 
  are you liking tarkin lead ? 
  that seems like something a psychologist would be more qualified to say than some guy in tech . 
  why do we care ? 
  i have n't had time to look at the data so i wo n't comment on the rest but, 
   i am not a fan of including unpublished studies here . 
  crap in , crap out . 
  i 'd want to see some sensitivity analysis on what would happen if certain `` low quality '' studies were removed from the analysis . 
  are both common and good practice . 
  seeking out unpublished data reduces the file-drawer effect which is especially important in a meta-analysis . 
  second , researchers always have to make inclusion decisions based on quality . 
  better to do so and state it clearly ( although hopefully they 've explained somewhere which and why ) than to either include poor quality research or not say they did .
