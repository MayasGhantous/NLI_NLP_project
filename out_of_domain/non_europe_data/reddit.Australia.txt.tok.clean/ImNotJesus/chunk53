  i could n't believe my luck when i 'd been feeling so down . 
  the genie told me that i could have three wishes but they would only be things that i could use today . 
  since i was already very drunk , i thought to myself , that 's fine , i 'll just have the best night ever . 
  so i said , `` i know , i want a huge bottle of martini , loads of coke ... ummm , hmm , i want a never before used hole . '', 
  with a puff of smoke the genie was gone . '', 
  that sounds amazing the first guy replied , why are you so depressed ? 
  the depressed man opened his plastic bag to show 2 coke cans , a bottle of martini and a fresh pack of socks . 
  magnificent, 
  do you have data to say it has or do you just think it has ? 
  if you just think it then it 's probably due to an availability heuristic, 
  i pee from outside the shower , aiming for the drain , while the water heats up . 
  i ca n't not do this . 
  too ... much ... cuteness ... ca n't ... hold ... on, 
  by that definition there is n't a huge difference but the connotations of the term are often different . 
  it 's just safer not to say it 's proven because it makes it sound like it 's an irrefutable fact . 
  really ? 
  you hide your feelings on the topic so well . 
  arrogance . 
  if you think you 're better than me , we probably wo n't get on . 
  if he cheated on you , no matter what had happened between you or how good looking she is , he is a massive dick and you 're better off without him . 
  no matter how amazing he was , you 're better off without someone willing to cheat . 
  i do n't know , it sounds like there 's * many *, 
  thanks folks , i 'll be here all week . 
  try the chicken, 
  it 's entirely likely but it 's no way to start a relationship . 
  you do n't . 
  it 's there to avoid reposts . 
  if you ** really ** think it 's that worth seeing , take a screenshot and host that on imgur, 
  i do n't . 
  but i 'm sane . 
  i 'm sure you 're being highly considered for the role . 
   for example , a link to someone 's twitter, 
  joe biden is a cyborg from the future at a bare minimum . 
  i have no idea why you 're randomly talking about streams in response to my comment . 
  i was replying to the op . 
  memes should have a 1 sideboob minimum, 
  shit where 's that michael jackson gif . 
  i want on this karma train . 
  god does n't exist and belief in the supernatural holds you back in life . 
  draw between pokemon and dbz, 
  make a list of pros and cons and post it . 
  which is you ? 
  must google pretty girl picture, 
  enter the dragon, 
  thread over, 
  i really like aspirins, 
  just in case anyone is wondering or wants to read up on them ; losing old memories is called retrograde amnesia and not being able to make new memories is anterograde amnesia . 
  i 'd personally choose retrograde because the videos i 've seen of a guy with anterograde looks horrible , not just for him but for his wife who has to look after him . 
  ** edit ** : clarity also [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwigmktix2y ) the link i was talking about . 
  ignore the title because it 's simply wrong ( and the word short-term memory is n't really used anymore - it 's called working memory ) . 
  that 's how retrograde amnesia works , yes . 
  no need to apologise sir , most people do n't know much about how memory works . 
  according to my mother , when i was 2 i told her `` when i 'm older i want to be a mommy '', 
  being a man got in the way of this so i 'm studying psychology instead . 
  so do most teachers, 
  could n't find the right sugar daddy so you 're looking for doctors now ? 
  same . 
  i was 5 '10 when i was 13 and then stopped growing . 
  thanks , 
  there 's an off button , you just ca n't turn them back on afterwards . 
  would n't want to use it . 
  i 'm not monogamous only because i fear getting in trouble . 
  if * you * are , then you 're missing out on one of the best parts of being in a relationship . 
  pants, 
  there are actually three kinds of people in this world . 
  those who can count and those who ca n't . 
  woah , that 's crazy . 
  came here to post when my uncle was about to die and told me that `` great powers come with great responsibility . '', 
  tact would dictate you do n't . 
  regardless of legality . 
  what if i do n't actually care but want to get to the front page ? 
  about 18 . 
  i 'm 24 and i 'm heading quickly in the wrong direction . 
  i think i might propose to my girlfriend to lock her in before i lose it all , just in case she sees me bald and changes her mind . 
  as for family history : neither side is over endowed with follicles, 
  i 'm gay, 
  i come from a jewish family and my girlfriend comes from a christian family . 
  we 're both atheists and use the religious events as chances to spend time with our extended families . 
  i sit quietly while they pray or do rituals and then just enjoy the experience . 
  also , it 's worth noting that christmas did n't originate with christianity , it 's a pagan festival based on the winter solstice . 
  put it into term deposits . 
  studies show that fund managers are barely ( if at all ) better than chance . 
  we had a smoking ban in basically all indoor public places here ( australia ) and there was outrage for about 2 weeks and now everyone is used to it . 
  i think it 's great , i 'm all for rights but not when they impinge on others . 
  if you really want to smoke , do it in the privacy of your own home . 
  clearly that one girl you met is representative of all women . 
  meet more girls , if they like the fact that you 're intelligent they 're the kind of girl you want to be with . 
  if they do n't like it , you 're better off without them . 
  depends on the kind of person you are . 
  some people peak in high school . 
  for me , university has been way better ( not that i hated high school ) because it 's given me so many more chances to be an individual and grow in whichever way i wish . 
  because you have a relatively mild form of the aversion that has n't generalised to similar experiences ( fake blood - interestingly one case study i read there was a girl who fainted at the term ` cut it out ' ) . 
  if it 's seriously maladaptive you should seek cbt treatment with a gradual exposure to more and more real viewings of blood . 
  you phobia may get better/worse over time , it 's hard to say . 
  i know that 's more info than you asked for but thought it may help you . 
  yes, 
  there are no health issues with me masturbating in the restaurant , why ca n't i do it ? 
  because at some point we have to decide that it 's not fair to inflict your personal choice on other people . 
  if i 'm swearing excessively i 'll get thrown out of the restaurant , same as if i 'm throwing out racial epithets loudly . 
  what would give a smoker the right to make my experience worse by smoking ?
