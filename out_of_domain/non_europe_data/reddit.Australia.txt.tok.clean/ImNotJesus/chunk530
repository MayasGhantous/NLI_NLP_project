  too soon ? 
  my dvr is almost full :(, 
  to those without reddit enhancement suite ; get it . 
  if so , did you do anything crazy in response ( stockpile food , get a bomb shelter etc. ), 
  this changes every second week for me but at the moment it is :, 
  `` be kind , for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle . '' - philo, 
  so far the leading candidates are masturbate furiously and eat stupid amounts of ice cream, 
  i think that we 'll start to understand mental health a lot better as a disease and start treating it as such . 
  it seems like demonoid has a bunch of good ones but i need an invite :( any other ideas ? 
  i 'm an undergrad psych student and am looking to expand my repetoire . 
  ( happy for it to be neurosci too ), 
  i understand that small amounts of moon rock have come to earth but is there any chance of a substantial enough hit that it destroyed or knocked it off its orbit ? 
  i 'm an undergrad student who spends a lot of time reading up on theories outside of our text . 
  i really like tmt and found a large meta-analysis that supported a moderate effect of mortality salience but i was wondering if anyone can tell me about how widely accepted it is or some major criticisms . 
  here is your challenge : what is the most obscure thing you can search for in google images that gets you a naked picture in the first page ( not animated for extra points ) . 
  obviously you will need to turn safe search off . 
  good luck !, 
  as a non-american ( australian ) , yes, 
  i know it 's a dumb , but i always write `` suprise '', 
  if so , how did it happen ? 
  who propositioned who ? 
  what 'd you get ? 
  i 've got a lecturer who comments when people do n't find her jokes funny . 
  `` oh , i thought that would get at least a few laughs '' . 
  what did you get ? 
  how did it happen ? 
  how did it happen ? 
  who instigated ? 
  what was traded ? 
  if so , how did it happen ? 
  who instigated ? 
  what was traded ? 
  it could be a secret about yourself , something you did to one of your friends you do n't want to tell them about , something nobody knows about you etc. 
  torn between :, 
  [ just the way you are ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi03ncndhha ) and, 
  [ hit me with your rhythm stick ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wgvgfjnlqc ), 
  if you think that your comment is funny purely because you 're doing what it says in your username then please refrain from commenting . 
  if you 're going to make an account that says what you 're going to do and then just post everywhere doing it , please do n't . 
  if you have a silly nickname and something refers to it it 's fine to make a joke about it but for the love of god please stop it with these terrible , terrible novelty where the only joke is that you 're doing what your name says . 
  kind regards ,, 
  i 've seen a great meta-analysis on mortality salience and they found a moderate effect but i was wondering how accepted the theory as a whole is . 
  my favourite is niggard or niggardly . 
  to explain ; she goes straight from stage 1 to stage 5 and i wanted to research that element in itself so i was hoping there was a name for it . 
  do you also find this incredibly stupid ? 
  unfortunately mine is [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjurt0o7uy ) ( do n't ask me how it got there ), 
  came up in a different thread and was pretty shocked to see how many people think it 's okay . 
  i 've always called myself an agnostic atheist but recently i changed my point of view on this because i do n't think it 's absurd to say that you 're an atheist who is gnostic about specific gods . 
  obviously you can never prove a negative so it 's impossible to say that no gods exist ( especially with how ill-defined the term is ) but i think it 's not a stretch to say that we can prove the god of the bible does n't exist . 
  all you need to do is accept that if there were an omniscient/omnipotent god then his book would be perfect . 
  therefore , the fact that the bible is clearly historically and scientifically wrong means that either it is not written as intended ( therefore , the god of the bible is different than explained ) or the god does n't exist at all . 
  i 'm currently leaning towards a tandoori chicken pizza with double meat . 
  any ideas ? 
  it is n't very common ( in my experience ) in australia and have never found any reason to have anything but admiration for the people that protect me . 
  are cops notoriously bad overseas or are some redditors sensitive because they 've had cops not allow them to do what they want ? 
  edit : to summarise most answers so far :, 
  * they really are dicks because power corrupts, 
  * availability heuristic - examples of abuse are much more noticeable and we do n't hear much about good cops, 
  * people do n't like being told what to do . 
  my top 5 are all from wow , i no longer play . 
  i 'm currently leading towards what 's your homepage because at least questions about girls may help someone . 
  i 've been looking for some research on this but struggling to find a good comparison of cbt against longer forms of talk therapy for patients with more complex emotional issues . 
  i 've heard this more than once from practising psychologists and wondering if that 's a relic from their old training or if there are some cases where it is superior .

  i 've always done this anyway but i was recently told that you also remember more . 
  hey askscience ; my so was wondering if any of you know of any negative side effects or long term damage from laser hair removal . 
  thanks in advance, 
  seriously , i 've seen like 15 posts about fast walkers today, 
  i get too distracted from shows with storyline if i reddit while i watch so my # 1 choice is qi . 
  thoughts ? 
  i often hear that harris/hitchens/dawkins do n't really convince anyone but the moderates who may have changed their view anyway and that they only serve to reinforce the views of the extremely religious . 
  i 've been thinking about this recently and i 've come to the conclusion that this is the best thing we can do long-term . 
  i think that in the last decade ( more so than ever ) religious and secular perspectives are being polarised and it 's forcing the religious to take more and more absurd positions . 
  i think we 're headed towards a tipping point where the religious are represented by fringe views and the apologists have less and less voice . 
  while this may be a dangerous situation in the short run we ** want ** it to be a situation where it 's intelligent design or atheism . 
  we want people to feel like believing in a god is a fringe belief . 
  if we take out the moderate middle , the people that make it palatable for unsure people to believe , we make it so much harder for the next generation to start believing . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** polarisation is a good thing because it makes religious views seem more ridiculous, 
  okay , so i was thinking about how i could explain a lot about the last 5 years of my life by the songs that felt like they perfectly struck me at that moment in time . 
  i do n't know how well this will work as a thread but let 's try it . 
  i 'll start :, 
  in the last 5 years i suffered and major depression and slowly recovered from it . 
  started feeling depressed : [ gary jules - mad world ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n3n1mlvvc4 ), 
  feel lost : [ monte montgomery - wishing well ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppmv7w9nqy8 ), 
  started therapy and was feeling hopeful but could n't handle feeling that way : [ newton faulkner - uncomfortably slow ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oelwf_jd3hy ), 
  realise what i want in life but know i have to be patient and i 'll get there eventually [ billy joel - vienna ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozdixvdu4p0 ), 
  realise that i can have what i want but that it terrifies the fuck out of me [ newton faulkner - something to believe in ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpanipkxbwa ), 
  now i feel like a million bucks [ queen - do n't stop me now ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgzgwkwlmgm ),

  as addressed [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i3m9z/seriously_guys_the_front_page_of_reddit_looks/ ) some people are having issues with the quality of submissions that reach the front page . 
  what i think we should do is create some sort of system where people can vote on what they want to see . 
  perhaps , if someone upvotes a submission it can be seen by more people and downvote something that is n't worth viewing . 
  here 's where the idea get 's crazy ; what we then do is create smaller communities for people to post more obscure things in and have more control over the type of content they want ( if it does n't agree with the consensus ) .
