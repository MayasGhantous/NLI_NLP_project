  eventually she realised that i had no idea and just kissed me herself . 
  tl ; dr apparently if a girl invites you in at 1am she does n't actually want to sit there watching some old jamie lee curtis movie with you, 
  ** edit ** : badly worded title is bad, 
  why do n't their daddies just give them more money ? 
  if it helps , like most people on this planet , i loved freakonomics and subscribe to their pod . 
  i can understand if you 're unaware that you need to pee and hearing the water makes you think about it but why do you need to pee * more * when you 're already desperate and hear some water ? 
  what would you offer to do for the money ? 
  `` of all tyrannies , a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive . 
  it would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies . 
  the robber baron 's cruelty may sometimes sleep , his cupidity may at some point be satiated ; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience '', 
  what is this cruel torture ? 
  i 'd like some perspective from lessons you 've learned in your fields or just your personal opinions :, 
  i come from a jewish family but am an atheist myself . 
  even when i was religious there was one thing that i always found very difficult , it was very common to talk about jews as being superior , preferable ( in terms of patronising their stores/services , supporting etc. ), 
  and an us v them mentality . 
  it would n't be at all uncommon for someone to say you should go to x 's store because they 're jewish but this was never seen as racist . 
  my position was always that if you could n't say the same sentence with the words `` not black '' without it sounding racist , then it 's wrong . 
  am i overly sensitive to this ? 
  is it normal for minority cultures ( in modern times ) to have an ` us vs them ' mentality that suggests one should support an ingroup member over an outrgoup member ? 
  do you think it 's right ?

  i was just at the supermarket and they have a promotion where you get a $ 1 voucher for a school of your choice for every $ 10 you spend . 
  as i have no kids i did n't need the vouchers . 
  instead of saying no when they were offered to me i asked the cashier to give it to the next person who asked for it . 
  the women behind me in line was so appreciative , even though it was no effort . 
  here are the rules :, 
  firstly , you get to choose your leader 's educational background . 
  you can choose their major area of study and two minor areas of study . 
  for example ; major economics , minor fine arts and dance . 
  it can be anything you would be able to study . 
  next you get to pick 3 main attributes . 
  these can be things like intelligence , integrity , charm etc. 
  lastly , pick your leader 's major and two minor platforms . 
  the can be things like ; major civil rights , minor conservative economics and church/state separation . 
  for years i 've been seeing a guy that does remedial massage . 
  he is a great masseur and a nice guy . 
  however , he is very passionate about chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture . 
  he convinced me to do acupuncture a few times ( a few years ago when i was less into the skepticism community ) and has tried to sell me herbal supplements a few times . 
  here 's my issue : i like the guy . 
  i think he gives great massage . 
  however , i resent people who push alternative medicine . 
  we 've had a few arguments about it and he knows not to push it on me but could you financially support someone when half of their business is pushing medicine that does n't work ? 
  i 'm starting to think that i ca n't . 
  am i being overly sensitive ? 
  with a crowbar, 
  i 'm sorry , i know this is n't the place for assignment help but i 've been looking everywhere and ca n't seem to find it . 
  does anyone know ? 
  you 're ... you 're not getting how this works are you . 
  it 's kind of like a hippy threatening to punch me in my aura . 
  where can i find a website where i 'll be in the majority ? 
  note : i 'm aware of strategies like mnemonics and chunking but i 'm curious about whether there are effective neuroplastic methods for increasing baseline ability for working memory . 
  wake up sheeple, 
  ** not - adverb **, 
  ( used to express negation , denial , refusal , or prohibition ) : you must not do that . 
  it 's not far from here . 
  ** give , gave , giv \u00b7 en , giv \u00b7 ing , - noun , verb ( used with object ) **, 
  1 . to present voluntarily and without expecting compensation ; bestow : to give a birthday present to someone . 
  ** a - indefinite article **, 
  1 . not any particular or certain one of a class or group : a man ; a chemical ; a house . 
  1 . an act of sexual intercourse . 
  because he only comes once a year, 
  i 'm definitely telling the truth . 
  does my bum look big in this ? 
  so refreshing that i do n't have to think anymore, 
  an extra fuck you to gay teens who want to share their experiences because they 're struggling with ostracism . 
  you 're the worst kind of monsters, 
  assholes, 
  please leave all personal opinions about it out of this thread, 
  it 's not the car i drive or the house i live in , but knowing that my children will never experience what it is to go a night without upvotes like i had to as a child . 
  if you want my opinion on economics i 'll be happy to link you to someone 's blog, 
  but i realised philately would get me nowhere, 
  i recently took a 9 hour flight that involved some pretty horrible turbulence and i 'm now getting a bit anxious about my flight home . 
  i was hoping that if i understood more about the process i would n't be as anxious . 
  1 ) what is turbulence ? 
  2 ) does bad turbulence mean you 're any more likely to crash ? 
  3 ) is flying at night more dangerous because it 's colder ? 
  4 ) is a slightly cheaper plane much more likely to crash ? 
  5 ) what are my odds of being in a crash ? 
  i 'm definitely a christian . 
  how awesome are atheists . 
  i 'm still definitely a christian though . 
  this was the first holiday i 'd had in years and had an absolutely amazing time . 
  i 'm pretty scared of heights though and as it turned out we had quite horrific turbulence ( if you 've never felt it before , it feels like the plane just starts dropping ) . 
  i was pretty terrified when it was at its worst but managed to grit my teeth and get through it . 
  about 30 minutes after the worst of it i was looking out the window and noticed the clouds below us . 
  all of a sudden i realised how absolutely absurd it was that i was sitting there . 
  i was in a chair , inside a metal box , flying through the air at insane speeds . 
  i was able to do that , incredibly safely and for not that much money . 
  there are n't many times that i 've been more blown away by how lucky i am to have more opportunities than the vast majority of people that have ever existed . 
  i know this story does n't seem very lifechanging but it has provided me with a wonderful perspective on my life . 
  or muhammad . 
  muhammad would be good too, 
  there is an entire subreddit for them .
