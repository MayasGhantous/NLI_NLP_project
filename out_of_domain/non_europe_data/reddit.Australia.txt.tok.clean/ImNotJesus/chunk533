  1 - how bad is caffeine for you ? 
  2 - is it really a diuretic . 
  if so , does simply drinking more water compensate ? 
  3 - are all caffeine delivery systems of similar danger ; is coffee better than an energy drink ? 
  grow up, 
  for example , if an average person walked briskly for 1 hour , how many minutes would that person have to jog to burn the same number of calories ? 
  a few questions , i 've tried to do some literature searches but come up with mixed results . 
  i do n't know a lot about organic produce but from what i have read , it seems like there is little to no benefit but i want to make sure i 'm informed in my opinion . 
  1 ) i 've read that organic farming requires the soil to be tilled up to 10x more , in turn releasing far more methane into the atmosphere . 
  is this true ? 
  2 ) have any large-scale studies been done to compare the healthiness of organic and inorganic produce ? 
  3 ) are there any other benefits/consequences of organic produce ? 
  in cooking , several items greatly change in their properties , do their calorie contents ever change ? 
  if that 's the case , would a regular diet cola habit significantly increase the risk of depression ? 
  what you do is get a small amount of pure rubbing alcohol and give it a normal homeopathic treatment . 
  keep diluting it and making it a smaller and smaller trace amount and then drink . 
  if you die of alcohol poisoning it proves that homeopathy works !, 
  oh well , guess jihad to be there, 
  long story i wanted to tell people, 
  also , if you can add any other info about the communication with deep space probes that 'd be great too . 
  i 've done lots of reading and it looks like i 'd be under general for 2 hours during the procedure . 
  i 've heard that there 's `` always a risk '' with general but i want to know what the risk is to make an informed decision . 
  so , what are my odds of a complication and how severe would that complication be ? 
  i have heard before that all surgeries that use anaesthesia have a level of risk due to complications . 
  ** i am not asking for medical advice ** however i would like to know more about the frequency of complications , what those complications involve and how that danger changes the longer the surgery goes ( for example , is a 2 hour surgery twice as dangerous as a 1 hour surgery ) . 
  faith in humanity restored, 
  i feel so full of brave juice right now,

  not a very strong swimmer and i stupidly went into strong waves on a windy day and started getting pulled out by a rip . 
  struggled to swim against it for a while and started having a panic attack because i was n't getting anywhere and was struggling to breathe . 
  managed to remember that you 're supposed to swim sideways and got just far enough out of the rip to be okay . 
  while i was in the the moment , felt like it was very possible that it was the way i was going to die . 
  fuck the mainstream media, 
  i 'm completely blanking .

   the most convincing studies of a casual effect of malnutrition on intelligence are derived from identical ( mz ) twins born with different birth weights . 
  such differences are generally attributed to reduced blood flow from the placenta to one twin leading to a reduced supply of nutrients , retarded growth and small size at birth . 
  since the twin pairs are genetically identical and experience the same family environment the only difference between them lies in nutrition received in the uterus . 
  the question is whether the twin experiencing the nutritional deprivation indexed by low birth weight has impaired intelligence later in life . 
  edit : my concern with the quote is as follows : the general article is about improved nutrition leading to increasing iq scores . 
  in an attempt to prove that better nutrition causes higher iq , they argue the above . 
  my concern is that it i 'm unsure whether the * only * effects of reduced blood flow from the placenta is decreased nutrition . 
  i would assume that it would also lead to other issues ( reduced oxygen ? ), 
  that would impact development , therefore making the point significantly less persuasive .

   in * the political brain * , drew westen ( 2007 ) argued that successful political movements must have a story that explains the origins of present problems and shows why the movement offers a solution . 
  he pointed out that coherent stories usually have an initial state ( `` once upon a time ... '' ) , protagonists , a problem or obstacle , villains who stand in the way , a clash , and a denouement . 
  these ideological narratives , as we call them , are clearly like life stories in most ways . 
  for example , they always incoroporate a reconstructed past and an imagined future , often telling a story of progress or decline . 
  but they are different from life-stories in one key respect : each person must be the first author of her own life story . 
  more than a little bit of plagiarism would be shameful . 
  but when people join together to pursue political projects - from the demand for civil rights to violent revolution to genocide - they must share a * common * story , one that they accept as true without having authored . 
  ideological narratives , then , by their very nature , are always stories about good and evil . 
  they identify heroes and villains , they explain how the villains got the upper hand , and they lay out or justify the means by which - if we can just come together and fight hard enough - we can vanquish the villains and return the world to its balanced and proper state .

  ** tl ; dr ** you ca n't ever let yourself forget that when discussing political ideology , the larger narrative is immensely important and often restrictive .

  unfortunately , there are a lot of dangerous people out there in the internets and we ca n't know if you 're one of them . 
  ** it is simply never acceptable to post or ask for personal information in this subreddit ** and it will result in your post getting removed and potentially a ban for the submitter .
