  1 ) * can you post your own personal information ? 
  we have no way of verifying whose personal information it is . 
  any identifying personal information is banned . 
  2 ) * can you post publicly available information ? 
  * that depends on the context . 
  if you 're posting a famous person 's twitter account , it 's clear that there is no intention of privacy . 
  if you post their home phone number , that 's crossing a line . 
  again , if you 're not sure , message the mods . 
  3 ) * my username has my full name in it , are you going to ban me ? 
  * i 'm not going to ban you ( unless i see blatant abuse of this exception ) but i ** highly ** recommend you change it anyway . 
  ** note ** : there is no way to * change * your username , you need to delete it and make a new one if you want to change names . 
  4 ) * does this apply to x subreddit ? 
  * / * what about what they do on y subreddit ? 
  * i 'm a moderator for / r/askreddit only and have no control over what any other subreddits do . 
  posting personal information * is * against reddit 's user agreement but it 's reliant on mods of individual subreddits to police it . 
  i know there have been some negative posts recently about mod-community relationship so i wanted to take the opportunity to give everyone a really big thank you . 
  a post that was just on the frontpage was editted to include a phone number . 
  in the 5 minutes before i saw it , the post was reported 180 times and we received a flood of messages to the mods . 
  ** thank you ** . 
  we ca n't possibly see all of this stuff and without you , the post would still be there and incredible damage could have been done . 
  just a reminder : if you ever see the sidebar rules being broken , report the post and send us a message if it 's important . 
  the more support we get from you , the better we can make sure this remains a top quality subreddit . 
  ** edit ** : inb4 `` this is n't a question '', 
  for example , caramelised onions become far sweeter when you cook them in that manner . 
  i know that they 're becoming sweeter because the molecular structure is changing but does that equate to more total calories or is it just more sweetness per calorie ? 
  sorry for the typo , i meant so * much * liquid . 
  i added a multi-subreddit link to my res bar at the top and i mis-typed one of the subreddits . 
  i ca n't work out how to remove it . 
  i 'm not sure if this information exists but i 'd love to know what it is , if it does . 
  i 've come to realise that my feelings on the topic are n't really supported by any evidence and more of a gut instinct . 
  hey , i was hoping to get some ( much more informed than mine ) opinions on [ this ] ( http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/18/11757222-nurses-yes-nurses-lead-charge-for-wall-street-sin-tax?lite ) . 
  would the change be positive ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/05/19/how-one-flawed-study-spawned-a-decade-of-lies/ ) a terrible and anti-scientific article written by someone who clearly has very little understanding of psychology and the history of research , as explained [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/tw21d/how_one_flawed_study_spawned_a_decade_of_lies/c4qc0fr ) . 
  i 'm pretty disappointed at how many upvotes this got and how little skepticism was visible in the comments until an hour ago . 
  it may be silly but i 'm very keen to do a filled pasta since i figure that i 'm more likely to forget that quickly than non-filled . 
  however , i also have my heart set on doing a duck ragu . 
  can i make this work or do i need to yield on one of those plans ? 
  ** please note : this is a self-post so i receive no karma for this , assist me getting the information out by upvoting it to the frontpage . 
  *** pancreatic cancer post ***, 
  there was a post about someone claiming to have pancreatic cancer on the frontpage that asked for advice . 
  it originally had a youtube link that featured her friends , this link was editted out . 
  there was some concern about the post being real so i said that if the youtube link goes back up , i 'll deal with it . 
  so , the link went back up ( despite op saying they went to bed ) and i decided to message op giving them 5 minutes to remove the link or i 'd be forced to delete the thread . 
  they deleted the thread themselves , essentially showing it was a scam . 
  the reason i bring this up is two-fold :, 
  i wanted to make sure there was no mis-information or backlash as a result of the incident . 
  this is a situation where someone tried to game the system for their own benefit and it was quashed . 
  in the thread i asked people to message the moderators if the link was put back up . 
  this was done , within 2 minutes , by about 6 people . 
  i wanted to give a big ** thank you ** to those who did this . 
  the mods ca n't possibly see every post/edit that comes along so we need your help . 
  reporting is brilliant and useful but in the following situations , please send us a ** message ** because we see that much faster than reports :, 
  personal information . 
  people asking for money . 
  iii . 
  requests for medical/legal advice . 
  general lynch-mob like behaviour ( asking people to downvote a person , raid a subreddit etc. ), 
  *** the proper use of downvotes ***, 
  from the [ reddiquette page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ), 
   please do n't downvote opinions just because you disagree with them . 
  the down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion . 
  everyone is guilty of this from time to time but i want to take this opportunity to ask you to please try and avoid doing this . 
  askreddit 's popularity is a result of the * discussion * that it generates . 
  if we want discussion , there is no better way to make this happen than having differing opinions and ideas throughout the thread . 
  if we use upvotes as a test of popularity of ideas , all we will get is the same , popular opinions at the top of every thread and miss the interesting and different ideas . 
  so , please , even if you disagree with someone 's idea/belief , if the post is ** adding to the discussion ** , please upvote it accordingly . 
  i know this is n't askscience and i 'm certainly not expecting you to downvote jokes or anything like that . 
  i 'd just love to elevate the brilliant discussion and melding of ideas we get here even further . 
  what about you jumps out at people ? 
  what impression would i be left with ? 
  due to the incredible response i got to the initial idea , myself and some ( amazing ) organisers have really gotten the ball rolling on this idea and i think you 'll like what we have in mind . 
  to start with , he 's a rough idea of what it 's going to look like :, 
  so , i read a lot of feedback from that initial thread and there were a few common problems - ( i ) people were ineligible to donate or ( ii ) had recently donated . 
  to make this inclusive , ** i want to make it so that anyone who wants to help people can be involved and enter the draw . 
  i want everyone to have the chance to be involved and feel proud of what 's going to be an amazing community effort ** . 
  i want it to be a positive and inclusive experience . 
  as a result , `` being involved '' may constitute any of the following :, 
  1 ) donating blood/plasma/platelets / ( signing up for ) marrow/organ donation . 
  2 ) supporting groups that are donating - organising a meet-up , going along for support , baking cookies , making prizes etc. 
  3 ) donating funds to a secular , non-donation related charity ( i 'm thinking doctors without borders since it 's quite universally liked but i 'm open to suggestions ) - ** any value donation will constitute involvement ** . 
  our aim is to have a month-long drive ( probably starting in august ) where we promote blood/plasma/platelet / marrow/organ donation . 
  the organisers will support the efforts in the following ways :, 
  1 ) have a large draw of all of those involved where people can win small , fun , redditor-made prizes - more to follow on the prizes . 
  2 ) help organise reddit meet-ups, 
  3 ) provide information about donation - why it 's important/how to do it - and support those wanting to donate . 
  ** how it will work ** - my image is very similar to the steam give-away . 
  for those who do n't know , all that you do is fill in your username and which game you want to win . 
  i think we can do roughly the same thing . 
  our prizes are going to be ** fun ** and ** not ** of high value ( expensive prizes bring a lot of ethical and logistical issues to the table that are n't necessary - the last thing we want is people pretending to be able to donate just to win prizes ) , we can work primarily on the honour system . 
  the image in my head is that redditors open the page ( at any stage during august ) and tick boxes based on their involvement :, 
  [ x ] blood donation, 
  [ ] platelet donation, 
  [ ] plasma donation, 
  [ x ] signed up for bone marrow, 
  [ x ] signed up for organ donation, 
  [ ] supported meet-up, 
  [ x ] provided a prize, 
  [ ] donated to x charity, 
  [ ] ineligible to donate due to recent blood donation, 
  the number of boxes ticked would have ** no impact on their chance to win ** , it would be purely for our stats at the end .
