  i think that all entrants should have an ** equal chance to win ** . 
  again , this only works if the prizes are fun and redditor-made . 
  i think that our primary aim should be to be fun and inclusive with the prizes making it more fun , not being an individual draw . 
  it will also be really fun at the end to have stats on how much was donated , how many people were involved etc. 
  it would make it really rewarding . 
  ** tl ; dr : fun , inclusive donation drive where we try to all band together to help people in need and win fun prizes ** . 
  ** other important news ** :, 
  * the admins have contacted us and are very excited about getting involved . 
  i ca n't make any promises yet but they 're going to be offering some great rewards . 
  * we 've already got an [ ** incredible , ever-growing list of fun redditor-made prizes ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ar_blood_drive/comments/vb60h/official_donation_prizes/ ) . 
  if you 're keen to donate a prize , make sure you post to that thread . 
  note : all prizes should be low financial value ( nothing you can sell for a lot of money ) but something fun for another redditor to win . 
  * our subreddit ** / r/ar _ blood_drive ** is alive and kicking . 
  the best place for up to date information is on there as well as lots of opportunities to get involved . 
  * if you want to find or organise a meet-up [ ** here is our official meet-up post ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ar_blood_drive/comments/vb9sq/official_organizing_meetups/ ) . 
  see if there 's already one in your area . 
  if there is n't , start one up !, 
  use your local subreddits to find people and make the experience fun . 
  * some prizes are too valuable or too location specific to be given in a random raffle . 
  as a result , we 'll be having an auction for some really fun prizes . 
  one such prize is an all-expenses paid day out with some troops to anywhere you want to go in southern california - sea world , san diego zoo , bar hopping , legoland , fisihing - anything you like . 
  these auctions will raise money for administration costs ( like mailing out prizes for the prize givers who ca n't afford to do it themselves ) . 
  * lastly , we 're adding amazing new activities features constantly . 
  this is just what we 've come up with in only a few days . 
  please make sure to sign up to ** / r/ar _ blood_drive ** to make sure you 're getting the most up to date news . 
  let 's start with a hypothetical . 
  you 're hiring someone to sell a product to a demographic that you know to be prejudicial . 
  if you hire a african american , homosexual or female , you know for a fact you 'll sell lose of your product . 
  is it okay to only hire straight white males ? 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm talking about ethics , not legality . 
  i think i 've got a handle on the straight pastas but i really want to start experimenting more with filled pastas . 
  i know the technique but i 'd love some ideas for different interesting fillings you can use . 
  whether they be classics that never fail or crazy ideas that seem to work , i 'd love some ideas . 
  so , what are you favourite filled pastas to cook/eat ? 
  so far my training has been incredible and it seems like a brilliant program . 
  i was wondering if anyone had any good/bad experiences that they would n't mind sharing so that i could learn more from the parents and recipients ' perspectives . 
  hi all ,, 
  just wanted to let you all know about some exciting news . 
  the moderators of / r/science have created a sister subreddit called / r/everythingscience to increase the science news , learning and entertainment you receive . 
  the idea behind / r/everythingscience is that it has a less restrictive rule set than / r/science . 
  on a daily basis we remove incredibly interesting news articles , educational videos , cool space photos and summaries of research that deserve a home . 
  however , / r/everythingscience will still be heavily moderated to ensure that all topics are about science and come from reputable sources . 
  please come [ have a look ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/everythingscience ) and help us get the ball rolling with some of your best science content that does n't fit on / r/science . 
  if you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to ask it here . 
  warm regards ,, 
  the mod team, 
  wow !, 
  what an incredible launch . 
  almost 2,000 subscribers in under a week is an overwhelmingly brilliant response . 
  thank you to all of you who have jumped on board so early and filled / r/everythingscience with content . 
  we 're going to keep promoting this subreddit on / r/science and i have no doubt that / r/everythingscience will be a huge community in no time . 
  a few people have been asking me what they can do to help support the subreddit 's growth . 
  the main aim right now is to have as much quality content as possible . 
  that way when people visit the subreddit , they want to hit that subscribe button . 
  that means the best way to help is to post and comment as much quality content as you can while upvoting others who do the same . 
  lastly , since you early adopters are key to making this subreddit work , i want your feedback . 
  \u2022 what do you like ? 
  \u2022 what do n't you like ? 
  \u2022 what could we do to make it a more enjoyable or better learning experience for you ? 
  feel free to respond with your feedback in this post or pm me if you wish to remain anonymous . 
  hey ,, 
  having a warranty dispute about my laptop and they 're claiming that they 're not responsible for software faults . 
  my laptop has overheated since day one and i want to claim that it 's a result of the extremely poor design ( fan replaced 3 times in just over 2 years ) . 
  is that reasonable ? 
  can regular overheating cause software issues ? 
  thanks for any help !, 
  edit : if it makes a difference , i 'm running windows 7, 
  if blake had been averaging these numbers all season , he would be 2nd in the league in points and first for power forwards in assists and field goal percentage . 
  there really is n't any functional reason why a user should be able to send 15 different modmail messages in 2 minutes . 
  i understand that this is bannable but even if the account is shadowbanned , they still have the ability to message us . 
  a rate limit would stop that . 
  [ click here to find the ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1yj3o7/science_ama_series_im_michael_e_mann/ ), 
  not sure how hard it would be to implement but there are several times a day where i end up looking through a user 's history to see whether they 're a good reddit/subreddit citizen to try and assess whether their rule breaking is habitual or a blip . 
  generally this means wading through page after page of history and with people who post a lot , you really ca n't see more than a day 's worth of history . 
  it would be ** amazing ** if there were a tally at the top of their user page ( or somewhere else where you could find it ) that tabulated the number of removed comments/links they have from subreddit 's you run . 
  this would allow moderators to identify habitual rulebreakers and thereby improve reddit quality overall . 
  let 's say that hypothetically i own a lot of 90 and 95 % pure stevia extract ( roughly 200x and 250x sweeter than sugar respectively ) and was curious what would happen if i tried to make caramel . 
  would this be the most insanely sweet caramel of all time or would it just burn ? 
  if it is possible , what would i need to know ? 
  would the process be any different to creating a normal caramel ? 
  hi everyone ,, 
  the mods thought that since we have n't for a while , it would be a good chance for some housekeeping . 
  there has been a small change to the wording of a rule , a few reminders about current rules and also a chance for you to give us some feedback about where the subreddit is now and where you want it to head in the future . 
  ** change to rule 8 **, 
  this change is n't drastic and it 's mostly to reflect how we already moderate the subreddit . 
  the rule was previously :, 
   ** mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users ' posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others . 
  ** content solely intended to offend or inflame will not be allowed . 
  and has been changed to, 
   ** mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users ' posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others . 
  ** all users are expected to be ** respectful ** to other users at all times . 
  personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans . 
  as you can see , we want to make it extremely clear that we wo n't tolerate personal attacks . 
  to be clear , you 're still allowed to make jokes and you 're still allowed to express opinions but comments may be removed when they 're malicious or only designed to be inflammatory . 
  examples :, 
   i dislike republicans because they do n't seem to understand that the privileges they received greatly impacted on their ability to have the success they now enjoy . 
  is fine because while it may be against a group of users , it 's an actual opinion that is posed as such . 
   fuck you republican scum . 
  is clearly an attack on a specific user/group of users . 
  it adds nothing except for making reddit less enjoyable for a subsection of our users .
