   republicans are a bunch of cunts . 
  is generic and not targeted at anyone but is still clearly just designed to inflame . 
  it adds no value . 
  at the end of the day , we do want this to be a free and open forum . 
  however , while it 's important to respect your right to open discourse it 's even more important to respect people 's right to have an abuse free reddit experience . 
  we ca n't promise to remove all nasty comments ( we receive tens of thousands of comments per day ) but we should all be striving to make askreddit as enjoyable for ** everyone ** as possible . 
  if you ca n't contribute without using slurs or getting into fights with everyone you talk to , perhaps you should consider whether you are adding or detracting from the subreddit . 
  ** rule 1/2 reminder **, 
  there is sometimes confusion about rules 1 and 2 so we wanted to try and clear some of it up . 
  the purpose of rules 1 and 2 is to make it so that questions get up/downvoted own their own merit , not based on the story or personal context from the op . 
  ** askreddit is for discussion questions ** , if you want advice , / r/advice is a better place to go . 
  if you only want to tell your story , there 's / r/self or / r/rant . 
  what we want to encourage in askreddit is genuine , open questions that allow for a range of responses and personal experiences . 
  in short , if the question is about * you * , it 's not appropriate for askreddit and you need to find a way to depersonalise it or find a more appropriate subreddit . 
  ** personal information **, 
  just a reminder to everyone that all personal information , made up or real , your information or someone else 's , will result in a ban without previous warning . 
  we ca n't possibly verify where a phone number comes from so if you post a real number , you ** will ** be banned . 
  the only context where it 's okay to post a phone number , address or e-mail address is publicly available information and is for an obvious , stated purpose ( e.g. , providing someone with a suicide helpline number ) . 
  of course , while identifying a specific user by their name is doxxing , it 's different to use the full name of barack obama . 
  as a good rule of thumb , do n't post information about anyone who does n't have a wikipedia page about them . 
  our top priority is the safety of users and posting pi can have very real implications for people . 
  we have zero tolerance for it and so do the admins . 
  that 's it for the rule changes and reminders . 
  we would really like to hear your feedback about where the sub is right now and where you 'd like it to go in the future . 
  you can always leave us suggestions at / r/ideasforaskreddit which is checked regularly by the moderators and has led to some ideas being implemented . 
  sidebar size is a significant roadblock for us in both / r/science and / r/askreddit which has involved moving the rules to the wiki for / r/science and shortening some in / r/askreddit . 
  additionally , we 're so out of wiki space in / r/askreddit can we ca n't use modtools tagging . 
  i know that it ca n't be unlimited but the defaults ** need more space ** because we have to cover a lot more ground and are dealing with the newest users on reddit . 
  a couple of quick points :, 
  * while you wo n't be ignored if you have no modding experience , this is an extremely difficult subreddit to moderate as a first one . 
  if you want to mod here in the future , we strongly recommend getting some experience in smaller subreddit - / r/needamod always has openings . 
  * every time we make an application post , we have applicants all of a sudden messaging us with rule breaking posts when they 've never done that before . 
  trust me , if you do n't already message us regularly , it will only make it seem like you just started paying attention to askreddit now . 
  that 's not to say that you ca n't message us , i just want to be clear that that strategy is ** extremely ** transparent . 
  * the questions are long and involved because moderating requires a lot of time and effort . 
  if you 're turned off by the questions or have limited time to commit , please do not apply . 
  * this post will be in contest mode and ** votes will be ignored ** . 
  do n't waste your time or effort downvoting other applicants .

  a couple of quick points :, 
  * we are looking for moderators with a ** science background ** . 
  if you are n't , as a minimum , in the process of a graduate degree , your application will not be considered . 
  * it is very common after an application post to see applicants all of a sudden messaging us with rule breaking posts when they 've never done that before . 
  trust me , if you do n't already message us regularly , it will only make it seem like you just started paying attention to / r/science now . 
  that 's not to say that you ca n't message us , we just want to be clear that that strategy is ** extremely ** transparent . 
  * the questions are long and involved because moderating requires a lot of time and effort . 
  if you 're turned off by the questions or have limited time to commit , please do not apply . 
  * this post will have all comments instantly removed by automod . 
  the reason for this is that we 're asking for information about your schooling history and do not want anyone publicly revealing personal information . 
  rest assured that only the moderators will see this .
