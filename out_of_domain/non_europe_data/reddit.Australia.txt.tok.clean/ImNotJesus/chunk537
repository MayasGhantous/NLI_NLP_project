  8 ) what should the role of moderators in general be ? 
  should moderators `` let the upvotes decide '' ? 
  9 ) what do you consider to be a bannable offence in / r/science ? 
  10 ) how should comments promoting pseudoscience or that are scientifically inaccurate be dealt with ? 
  why do you think that approach should be taken ? 
  11 ) what experience do you have with css and creating automod conditions ? 
  if you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to message the moderator group about it . 
  if you ask your question in this post , it is very unlikely to be seen . 
  we often hear people asking for accountability on reporting because it can be so annoying for moderators to have people misuse the report button . 
  however , adding names to reports is very problematic . 
  if we instead reward people who report bad posts ( maybe even a trophy for outstanding reporters ? ), 
  it will only make moderators lives easier and increase user engagement with the rules . 
  as an added bonus , it will make it abundantly clear when people are report spamming ( and therefore easy to pass on to the admins ) as well as giving an extremely helpful metric when assessing new moderator applications . 
  for example , if i am a new or expecting parent , i would search for `` parenting '' and find / r/parenting or / r/daddit or lots of other useful subreddits that i 've never heard of because we do n't have this function . 
  hey all ,, 
  thanks for taking the time to read this . 
  we do n't do modposts often but we do have some important information and reminders . 
  as always if you have any general feedback for us , you can always [ send us a message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit_mods ) or just reply below . 
  please keep it civil and constructive though . 
  ### ** new mods **, 
  in our continued effort to improve the quality of the subreddit we 've added a large group of new moderators . 
  please make very welcome , our new moderators dr_peach , firedrops , dommaggot , feedmahfish , glr123 , icebean and ubiquitinatedkarma . 
  they were all selected based on their activity , quality of their application and background in science . 
  if you also have a science background and want to help improve the commenting quality in / r/science , [ please send us a message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2faskreddit_mods ) . 
  thank you to everyone who applied , we had an extremely high quality of candidates which is why we invited so many . 
  ### ** commenting rules **, 
  this is just a reminder to everyone that / r/science is a ** moderated subreddit ** . 
  our primary purpose is to bring * new science findings * to people as well as having a * high level of discourse * where people can learn more about the topic . 
  there are thousands of subreddits devoted to personal anecdotes/opinions and jokes/memes . 
  / r/science does n't need to be another one . 
  the full list of rules can be [ found in the wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules ) but they are as follows :, 
  comments must be on topic and not a meme or joke . 
  comments must strive to add to the understanding of a topic or be an attempt to learn more . 
  abusive , offensive or spam comments will be removed and repeated or malicious offenders may be banned . 
  while anecdotal evidence will not necessarily be removed , comments that are unscientific or promote pseudoscience without proper evidence will be removed . 
  references to peer-reviewed papers in your comments will always be better received so always try to reference your comments . 
  arguments that run counter to well established scientific theories ( e.g. , gravity , global warming ) must be substantiated with evidence that has been subjected to meaningful peer-review . 
  comments that are overtly fringe and/or unsubstantiated will be removed , since these claims can not be verified in published papers . 
  at the end of the day , we want the comments section to continue to be an environment where experts can teach others more about their field . 
  the fact is though , that low quality content outnumbers good quality content because , well , it 's much easier . 
  if we do n't remove the jokes , memes and unfounded personal opinions , the often extremely valuable information provided in the comments can be missed . 
  additionally , if you 're someone who wants to take the considerable time to write a well-informed and cited reply , you 're not going to be motivated to do so if a dumb joke gets more votes than you . 
  in sum , if you 're not adding to the discussion , you 're actively taking away from it . 
  as a good rule of thumb ; ** would you say that statement or ask that question if you were in a science classroom ? 
  ** if the answer is no , please take the comment to a more appropriate subreddit . 
  however , we do get wonderful support from our regular users who support high quality content . 
  if you want to help , please make sure to only upvote quality content and hit that report button if you see anything bad . 
  ### ** post headlines **, 
  we 've received a lot of complaints about post headlines and unfortunately , we have to agree that we do see some very low quality headlines from time to time . 
  in an effort to reduce baiting and improve the overall quality of submissions , we 're instituting a new rule about post headlines . 
  for your headline to be allowed , it must be one of the following :, 
  a ) news article title, 
  b ) title of original research or, 
  c ) your own title that is * more * accurate than the news article title, 
  if the title does not fit these criteria or the article you are linking to has an overtly baiting/editorialised title , we will remove the post from listing . 
  if you see a poor title , please make sure to hit that report button . 
  ### ** ama series **, 
  thank you to everyone who has been commenting and discussing ideas in the new ama series . 
  there 's a calendar on the sidebar and you can read some or all of the older amas [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/search?q=flair%3a%27ama%27&sort=new&restrict_sr=on ) . 
  if you know any seasoned scientists who you think would be interested , please encourage them to contact us . 
  ### ** / r/everythingscience **, 
  for those that are n't aware , our sister subreddit / r/everythingscience has blossomed over the last few months and is now more active than ever . 
  in short , the purpose of / r/everythingscience is to provide a general science based subreddit that does n't have as strict submission rules as / r/science . 
  however , all posts are still required to be from reliable sources and on the topic of science . 
  in fact , the top 5 submissions at any given time can even be seen on the / r/science sidebar so please head over there and check it out . 
  there 's lots of good science content that we wish we could fit on / r/science . 
  alright , we 've made you read * more * than enough . 
  as always , if you have any questions or ( constructive ) comments , please feel free to reply below or send us a message and thanks for helping us continue to improve the subreddit . 
  thanks ,, 
  the mod team, 
  ah , gary johnson 's ama . 
  you knew it was going to be full of jerking but this is a whole new level . 
  victim blaming someone who is mentally ill because he ca n't afford healthcare . 
  libertarianism 101 - if you 're not rich enough to get healthcare , it 's probably your own fault . 
  let 's have a look at some of the charming responses . 
  [ the op asked the following ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/23qbtl/ask_gov_gary_johnson/cgzkbvj ) :, 
   gary johnson , i can not afford the therapist i know i need and overall feel as if i have no future . 
  i am just another poor person being squeezed out and left to dry by the ultra-rich . 
   as someone wanting to run for president , what hope can you give me that the country being ` fiscally conservative ' is going to help me and my family reach that american dream of upward mobility ? 
  what will individual freedom and liberty do to help my situation ? 
  seems like a reasonable question , mental healthcare is expensive and a significant percentage of americans ca n't afford it . 
  let 's see how other redditors and the governor respond :, 
   there 's a fuckton of things available for you to do right now . 
  nobody owes you or me shit . 
  charming . 
   your problem is that you keep waiting for the world to change rather than changing your own world . 
  i 'm pretty sure the problem was his untreated mental illness but hey , have you considered just not being sick ? 
  it worked for my cancer . 
  i just decided to stop having it . 
   he did n't mention it , but a cut in taxes would allow you to spend more of your own money , assuming you make 30000 + per year . 
  if not , charities , privately funded ( and receiving more donations for the same reason ) could also help you out . 
  not insensitive , just the usual `` do n't worry , the free market fixes everything '' with no evidence to support it . 
   if you want to succeed drop this entitled attitude . 
  successful people are not the cause of your failure , and its not the governments job to make you succesful either . 
  it takes hard work and dedication . 
  seriously , snap out of that mental illness . 
  stop being sick , you idiot . 
   ya what can the country do for me ? 
  screw what i do for country . 
  that 's right , no one should ever expect support from their country in their time of need .
