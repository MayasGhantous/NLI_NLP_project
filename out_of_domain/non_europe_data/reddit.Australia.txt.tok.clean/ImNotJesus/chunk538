  if you ever ca n't afford to take care of feed yourself you should choose to die instead of taking from your country . 
   wow , that sense of entitlement , `` how are you going to make my families lives the american dream '' . 
  this is what libertarianism specifically opposes ; governments purpose is not to hold your hand . 
  individual liberty means having the freedom to determine the course of your life through your decisions . 
  stop being entitled !, 
  just choose to not need mental health care anymore and choose to make millions of dollars . 
  just decide it , it 's easy . 
  and , of course , the man of the hour himself . 
  here 's the wonderfully empathic and concerned response of a presidential hopeful to someone who ca n't afford basic mental healthcare :, 
   the best chance you have to reach the american dream is through entrepreneurship . 
  individual freedom and liberty will better allow you to do that . 
  ** create your own job -- do n't be a victim . 
  take control of your own future !, 
  ** [ emphasis mine ], 
  there you have it ladies and gentlemen , just decide to stop being a victim and become an entrepreneur . 
  it 'll fix what ails you . 
  oh , and if you ca n't because you 're too ill ? 
  well , fuck you , stop being a victim . 
  just received an anova from my incredible wife for my birthday - yay !, 
  however , i do n't have a good heatproof tub yet so i 'm just using a large stainless steel pot . 
  of course , the pot is getting quite warm and i 'm just wondering where i should leave it . 
  i 've got it on the stove but it 's a small stove and is prohibiting me from cooking other things ( i 'm scared of too much heat next to the unit ) . 
  where do you keep your circulator while cooking ? 
  to be clear , by illegal activity i mean promoting the activity itself like subreddits devoted to child porn , not discussion of an activity itself like / r/opiates . 
  most large mod groups use private subreddits to discuss ideas and vote on proposals . 
  while there are workarounds , polls based on votes are inaccurate due to fuzzing . 
  however , there is little need for fuzzing in private subreddits due to their size and * extremely * limited scope for spam so workarounds * should * be unnecessary . 
  please disable it , thanks !, 
  just finished a really fun game where i was playing korea on a large pangea . 
  i only had 4 cities but my capital had all of the best wonders and i had a big science advantage . 
  my plan was to be everyone 's friend until i can start pumping out planes and strike then . 
  it was all going well until china was starting to get too big - they mass expanded and were catching me in science/starting to get some of the wonders i coveted . 
  i realised i needed to slow them down but did n't want to sacrifice my tech advantage by converting to building a large army so i paid china to go to war with ** everyone ** near them ( cost barely anything - that should have been a red flag ) . 
  anyway , about 15 turns later they had completely taken out venice , taken dido 's capital and a few of catherine 's city . 
  they basically won wars against 4 neighbouring civs at the same time and gave themselves a huge boost in the process . 
  still managed to win because of the computer 's inability to fight once planes are involved but it got very hairy . 
  i had a game recently with isabella where i settled my city immediately since i had a nice desert area with lots of hills/luxuries that was going to be killer with petra . 
  my warrior moves and 1 tile outside of my vision - within a 3 tile range of my city - is the barringer crater ( 500 gold ) . 
  i make a scout and send him off north where i discover an area with 2 city-states and the only access to the area is through my capital . 
  it 's a large open area with plenty of resources that i can expand into without challenge . 
  my scount goes to the edge of the landmass only to find , you guessed it , great barrier reef ( 1000 gold ) with two sea resources next to it . 
  it was jut obscene . 
  since modnotes are for subreddit only , i 've sometimes had a terrible run in with someone in one default and that information would be useful in another default ( generally because they 're a terrible human being ) . 
  it would be very useful if it were marked somewhere that they are banned in another subreddit so i could investigate that and use the information accordingly . 
  please note : i have less computer knowledge than most grandmothers so i apologise if this idea is entirely impossible . 
  edit : in case it 's relevant , i 'm doing a psychology phd and working with large data sets that contains multiple levels ( e.g. , country , religion , individual variables ), 
  the current system is broken . 
  the old defaults are topped by inactive moderators and people who are n't involved anymore . 
  please help the people who actually run the subreddits to take back their subs and avoid the ** huge ** range of issues involved in having inactive mods with power over active mods ( account break-ins , dramas like the one seen in ** omitted subreddit name ** , removal of active mods due to grudges etc. ) . 
  default subreddits are the face of reddit and it is in the admin 's interests to make sure that inactive people who are not in touch with the subreddit are removed . 
  i 'm sure it has been mentioned before . 
  it would be extremely helpful in allowing us to give some valuable information to people who are banned ( e.g. , most bans in * subreddit name * are temporary , do n't respond to this message by calling us slurs and things wo n't get out of hand ) . 
  i do n't really see any downside , especially because people who do n't post in your sub do n't see ban messages so there 's really no room for abuse . 
  it does n't need to be customisable for each banning - just let us have a default message that gives the relevant information we want to get across to a banned user . 
  cavs - wiggins, 
  bucks - parker, 
  magic - exum, 
  jazz - gordon, 
  celtics - randle, 
  lakers - smart, 
  kings - payton, 
  hornets - mcdermott, 
  ** edit ** - picks 11-15, 
  nuggets - saric, 
  magic - stauskas, 
  wolves - lavine, 
  suns - t.j. warren, 
  unfortunately , people misuse edits in malicious ways that may lead to bannings . 
  for example , some people like to wait until significant voting has occurred on a popular post and then edit their comment to ( a ) promote something ( b ) add a horrible message or ( c ) manipulate how the votes are viewed by drastically changing their message . 
  in sum , being able to edit allows them to manipulate the voting system after the fact and use that visibility maliciously . 
  please allow moderators to see previous versions of the comment so we can better assess what has happened in those situations as it is sometimes unclear and we are reliant on other user 's comments . 
  i 'm guessing the obvious objection here is that users should have a right to remove their own pi . 
  i agree . 
  however , moderators are already trusted to see removed and/or shadowbanned comments and to not act on it maliciously , i do n't think this would be any different . 
  i really want to get started on smoking but have a pretty low budget . 
  the cheapest unit i could find was [ this ] ( http://www.usafoods.com.au/sauces-and-spices/bbq-sauces-marinades/old-smokey-bbq-smoker-14 ) which seems like it might be big enough for most of what i want to do but i 'm not sure . 
  do i definitely need to start with something bigger ? 
  also , it seems like that unit only takes charcoal and not wood chips . 
  is there any point in using something that only uses charcoal or do i ** need ** something designed for wood to do any real smoking . 
  if it helps , i 'm mostly looking to cook things like boston butt , bacon , ribs etc. 
  lastly , do you have any good beginner 's guides that i should look into ? 
  i love the temporary change to sorting feature because i rarely want to change my sorting preference permanently . 
  in the same way , i only want to sort by top/alltime when i find a new and interesting subreddit . 
  while it is only a minor inconvenience changing it back , it could be a useful feature . 
  would it improve discussion or make it worse ? 
  it 's obvious to any regular user that karma changes behaviour . 
  while reddit normally unduly encourages low-effort , high quantity posts , this would disincentivize that behaviour by drastically reducing how much karma the person can get . 
  that being said , if karma is the carrot , do people who try to make high quality posts have less incentive to do so ? 
  since we have so many scientists ' expertise and millions of users interested in learning more about science , the / r/science mods want to trial a regular feature where trained scientists will explain important concepts to help you understand science better . 
  the posts will cover questions of ** how science works ** and also try to give you a guide to important ** basic concepts in different fields ** . 
  so , please help by letting us know the following :, 
  1 ) which areas of ** statistics , study design and the process of research itself ** are commonly misunderstood or would be valuable to you in understanding science research better ? 
  example : what are significance tests and what do they tell us ? 
  2 ) which ** key concepts ** in different fields of science are commonly misunderstood or would be valuable to you in understanding science research better ? 
  example : what are vaccines and why are they important ? 
  ** rationale ** : once a user has been banned , the moderators have no recourse to stop a user harassing them in modmail . 
  if they continue to spam ( very ) excessively , the admins will eventually step in but there 's nothing to stop them from sending multiple slur filled and harassing messages . 
  also , particularly nasty users will sometimes create a stream of day old accounts to keep spamming the modmail . 
  lastly , even after the admins have shadowbanned a user , the messages are ** still ** received . 
  since moderators are expected by the admins to read modmail regularly , we are then forced to constantly see their vitriol .
