  ** proposed mechanism ** : the obvious issue with this is misuse by moderators who want to ` hide ' things they 've done to a user . 
  i think this would be a pretty rare case since they could pm other mods but to account for it anyway , i think it could work like this : have a ` block user ' button in modmail that can only be used after the moderators have received a message from the user and only after a message has been received . 
  it would then reply to the user with a form message that says something like `` the moderators have blocked you from further contact . '', 
  it would also then show that as a reply in modmail with the username of the person who blocked them ( but only show the username to other mods like with ban messages ) . 
  that way , it is clear to the user that they have been blocked and also makes it abundantly obvious to other mods as well , thereby reducing the ability of individual mods to abuse the system . 
  ** additional benefit for the admins ** : by allowing moderators to block users to are spamming them , it will cut down on the messages admins receive about abusive/spamming users . 
  thanks to one of the many brilliant [ suggestions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2bi3rp/what_could_the_mods_do_to_improve_raskreddit/cj5kftu ) we received from a feedback post we put up [ 2 weeks ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2bi3rp/what_could_the_mods_do_to_improve_raskreddit/ ) , we 've decided to ** trial ** a new type of question tag . 
  as always , we really appreciate suggestions and regularly read and respond to posts in / r/ideasforaskreddit . 
  ### the way it works, 
  all you need to do is add [ stories ] before or after your question and it will be automatically flaired . 
  in a [ stories ] post , all * top level comments * ( top level comments are replies to the original question , replies to replies are not counted ) must contain a story that has been fleshed out and explained . 
  we 're not checking veracity , we just expect effort be put in ( that being said , things like tree fiddy will be removed ) . 
  automod will remove any top level comments that are n't at least ~ ~ 750 ~ ~ 500 characters long and we will also be checking the posts manually as much as we can . 
  additionally , the question * must be * appropriate for a [ stories ] tag or it will be removed . 
  for example , '' [ stories ] what is your favourite colour ? '', 
  is impossible to answer with longer comments and would therefore not qualify . 
  we hope you enjoy the new feature and please keep in contact with us on / r/ideasforaskreddit about any other new ideas you have . 
  based on the wildly successful [ job fair ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/29oykm/reddit_can_we_have_a_reddit_job_fair/ ) post from a month ago , the askreddit mods would like to run a semi-regular feature where we allow you to field questions about your job/career . 
  the way this works is that each top level comment should be ( a ) what your job/career is and ( b ) a few brief words about what it involves . 
  replies to each top level comment should be questions about that career . 
  some ground rules :, 
  1 ) you always have to be aware of [ doxxing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doxing ) on reddit . 
  make sure you do n't give out any specific information about your career that could lead back to you . 
  2 ) we are not taking any steps to verify people 's professions . 
  any advice you take is * at your own risk * . 
  3 ) this post will be in contest mode so that a range of careers will be seen by everyone . 
  make sure to press the ** `` show replies '' ** button to see people 's questions !, 
  enjoy !, 
  i have a lot of small subreddits that i try to keep track of . 
  some are social while others are mod related or were created for a specific purpose . 
  as they only have posts made very rarely , i do n't check them constantly for new posts . 
  as such , i often do n't see things for long periods of time ( i know there are tools like modmailer but there are limitations on those ) . 
  anyway , what i was hoping to suggest is the ability to elect to receive an inbox notification whenever a new post is made in a specific subreddit . 
  you could limit it by size ( obviously someone ` subscribing ' to askreddit would put too much pressure on the system ) but it would be immensely useful for smaller subs and allow people to keep track of them . 
  hey guys ,, 
  struggling to find any consistent answers on this but i want to run a multiple regression ( in spss if that matters ) and two of my variables are very skewed . 
  one is negatively skewed , the other positively . 
  how do i proceed ? 
  i keep reading different things . 
  thanks, 
  or the original model chubby for that matter .

  probably worth limiting to subs over a certain size to reduce abuse . 
  [ removed ], 
  problems :, 
  1 ) some new users do n't understand the difference between receiving modmail responses and pms . 
  as a result , when they receive a modmail response they then pm back the person who replied to them , causing much confusion . 
  2 ) although muting has helped to some degree , mods still get harassed by users , a lot . 
  in my experience , what tends to happen is that the user will tend to blame the first username that has responded to them , taking things to pms or harassing via anti-mod subs . 
  3 ) many users believe modmail to be a 1-1 communication system when they receive a reply and are confused when they get replies from multiple mods . 
  solution :, 
  the vast majority of large subs work in a team system where there is n't a functional difference in who 's replying in modmail . 
  as a sub , it matters to * us * who responds ( so that we know who is saying what ) but the message comes from us as a team . 
  therefore , add a subreddit setting or tick box on individual replies that allow subs that functionally work like that to send all modmail messages as a team , instead of individuals . 
  in doing so it would, 
  a ) reduce confusion from users . 
  b ) reduce duplicate messages in modmail, 
  c ) portray that messages are coming from an entire team , not an individual and, 
  d ) drastically reduce mods being harassed via pms and anti-mod subs . 
  thank you for taking the time to read this .

  hey , quick question . 
  are you able to use a trap support gem with active gems that are already traps ( e.g. , fire , ice etc. ) ? 
  i 'm just wondering because i never see people use it but it 's a really nice more multiplier . 
  sorry if this is covered somewhere , i read through the faqs . 
  also , worth noting that i have a 3 * stormtrooper - should i try to upgrade him or work on getting someone better ? 
  edit : thanks all !, 
  level 45 : my main arena team is different combinations of chewy/sid/jedi consular/talia/qgj / gs/ig86 . 
  i find that if i try to focus on other characters he taunts but if i focus on him it takes too long and i lose someone in the process . 
  what are the best ways to counter ? 
  so i 'm trying to make a second account and restart until i get someone i like but google is starting to put up blocks . 
  my process was this :, 
  sign out in the game, 
  go into the play games app, 
  create new account, 
  sign into that account in game, 
  the problem i 'm having is that google started wanting to send me text verification and has now cut me off from using the same phone number . 
  is there some better way to create new accounts or reset the guest account ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  hey guys ,, 
  so i 'm a relatively new player ( compared to all of you ) running a rebel squad . 
  i 'm level 58 and my current arena squad is aa , st han , leia , luke and lumi . 
  the team is going great and i 'm consistently top 3-5 ( despite some huge whales ) and not dropping too heavily in between my fights . 
  however , now that most of the top squads have protection and more dps , it seems like the value of healing is going down and it 's time to replace lumi ( i had always planned to at some stage ) . 
  these are my current leading candidates , please let me know what you think . 
  * qgj - all of the other top teams use rg and i do n't currently have a way to remove taunt . 
  plus , he 's quick and extra attacks with my squad seems very useful . 
  * hrs - gains speed from aa , tm to all teammates seems crazy good and his special looks great . 
  * phasma - thought he might be useful to sub in since he * is n't * a rebel , meaning that i raise the chances of my free attacks being from luke/leia . 
  also has a nice team buff and group slow . 
  plus , my lumi will be 7 * in a couple of days so my gw shipments are free . 
  * lando - seems very rng based but crazy damage when things go well . 
  another rebel so nice speed boost for him . 
  i 'm open to other suggestions . 
  i also have a 5 star daka , 4 star dooku , 3 star gs and 2 star rg . 
  it seems like you can get some key parts from f2p farming spots ( lando , phasma , 88 ) , would a team like that be viable long term ? 
  how would you fill it out ? 
  ( f2p if it matters ),
