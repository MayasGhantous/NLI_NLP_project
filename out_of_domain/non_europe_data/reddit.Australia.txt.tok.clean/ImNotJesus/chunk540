  everyone talks about lando 's moustache but biggs has a wonderful stache too, 
  thoughts ? 
  i think customisation is the most fun part of games like this and would love more options to customise my squad . 
  hi all ,, 
  i used to volunteer for a call centre that shall remain nameless but rhymes with shmifeline . 
  anyway , as r u ok day is today , lots of people have questions about how to support others who are n't okay so i was hoping to be a resource . 
  here are some faqs from my experience but feel free to ask questions below and i will try to respond . 
  ** can asking someone make them feel worse ? 
  it 's certainly possible . 
  bringing up sad feelings can be tough to deal with sometimes . 
  however , it 's important to remember that you 're not going to * make * someone suicidal by talking about suicide . 
  if anything , they will feel less suicidal after getting some of those thoughts outside of their head . 
  they might feel sad afterwards but if they 're suicidal or otherwise not coping , they 're probably feeling sad pretty often anyway . 
  if you listen and are compassionate , you will help them overall . 
  ** i 'm scared i 'll say the wrong thing **, 
  the number one mistake you can make is thinking you can fix anything they 're going through . 
  you ca n't . 
  if there was a pearl of wisdom or some answer to their problem , they 'd probably have worked that out by now . 
  even if it seems glaringly obvious what they need to do , trying to fix a deep emotional issue will only lead to the other person feeling like you 're not hearing them . 
  ** resist the urge !, 
  ** what do i say then ? 
  ask them how they 're going . 
  ask them why they feel so sad . 
  ask them what 's changing in their life and how they wish things were different . 
  the key here being that the best support you can provide ( unless you 're a professional which you 're not if you 're reading this ) is to just provide support . 
  provide what we call `` unconditional positive regard '' . 
  they 're not bad or wrong or broken , they just feel how they feel and * that 's okay * , even if it does n't feel that way . 
  phrases like `` oh wow that sound tough , i 'm so sorry you 're going through that ? 
  is anything else going on too ? '', 
  ** how can i help them moving forward ? 
  there are lots of useful things you can do . 
  if you managed the conversation okay , you can offer to be a resource if they start to feel especially down . 
  you can offer to help them find more help if they want to do so ( looking up therapists , making a booking for them etc. ) . 
  even just being a friend and offering to come and watch tv sometimes so there 's someone else around can be a huge difference . 
  this was all written a bit stream of consciousness so please let me know if something is unclear or you have any other questions . 
  it 's incredible that as a society we 're starting to have these conversations and your bravery in talking about it with a friend or family member could literally be the difference between life and death . 
  most importantly , i ca n't emphasise enough the effect of warmth and compassion on someone going through a hard time - do n't underestimate how much you can help . 
  hi guys and gals ,, 
  i quite enjoy reading the sub and generally teasing the nazi cheeto and his supporters . 
  that being said , in the spirit of wanting to be ** better ** than them , i was hoping to point out the potential damage done by using the word `` triggered '' . 
  i know that it 's done to mock them , but i think this sub is capable of better . 
  using the term triggered to denote mild emotional upset is actually really offensive to people who have experienced significant trauma . 
  it also trivialises what is actually important terminology in trauma treatment . 
  a trigger being something that is likely to cause a re-experiencing of trauma ( e.g. , a gun shot for someone who developed ptsd at war ) . 
  therefore , the aim of `` trigger warnings '' is to give approprtie warning to ptsd sufferers that a topic being covered may cause them to re-experience their trauma in a situation that could be very difficult to dealt with ( e.g. , discussing rape in a lecture theatre for someone who was traumatised by rape ) . 
  talking about being `` triggered '' by something that is merely annoying is actually quite cruelly mocking . 
  so while i know the intention is n't to mock any ptsd sufferers , i 'm hoping that this explanation can lead some of you to be a bit more careful with your words . 
  [ removed ], 
  the / r/science discussion series is a series of posts by the moderators of / r/science to explain commonly confused and misunderstood topics in science . 
  this particular post was written by myself and / u/fsmpastafarian . 
  please feel free to ask questions below . 
  a cornerstone of scientific study is the ability to accurately define and measure that which we study . 
  some quintessential examples of this are measuring bacterial colonies in petri dishes , or the growth of plants in centimeters . 
  however , when dealing with humans , this concept of measurement poses several unique challenges . 
  an excellent illustration of this is human emotion . 
  if you tell me that your feeling of sadness is a 7/10 , how do i know that it 's the same as my 7/10 ? 
  how do we know that my feeling of sadness is even the same as your feeling of sadness ? 
  does it matter ? 
  are you going to be honest when you say that your sadness is a 7 ? 
  perhaps you 're worried about how i 'll see you . 
  maybe you do n't realize how sad you are right now . 
  so if we ca n't put sadness in a petri dish , how can we say anything scientifically meaningful about what it means to be sad ? 
  ** subjective experience is worthy of study **, 
  to start , it 's worth pointing out that overcoming this innate messiness is a worthwhile endeavor . 
  if we put sadness in the `` too hard '' basket , we ca n't diagnose , study , understand , or treat depression . 
  moreover , if we ignore subjective experience , we lose the ability to talk about most of what it means to be human . 
  yet we know that , on average , people who experience sadness describe it in similar ways . 
  they become sad as a response to similar things and the feeling tends to go away over time . 
  so while we may never find a `` sadness neurochemical '' or `` sadness part of the brain '' , the empirically consistent structure of sadness is still measurable . 
  in psychology we call this sort of measure a ** construct ** . 
  a construct simply means anything you have to measure indirectly . 
  you ca n't count happiness in a petri dish so any measure of it will have a level of abstraction and is therefore termed a construct . 
  of course , constructs are n't exclusive to psychology . 
  you ca n't put a taxonomy of a species in a petri dish , physically measuring a black hole can be tricky , and the concept of illness is entirely a construct . 
  ** how do we study constructs ? 
  to start , the key to any good construct is an operationalized definition . 
  for the rest of this piece we will use depression as our example . 
  clinically , we operationalize depression as a series of symptoms and experiences , including depressed mood , lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities , change in appetite , physically moving slower ( `` psychomotor slowing '' ) , and thoughts of suicide and death . 
  importantly , and true to the idea of a consistent construct , this list was n't developed on a whim . 
  empirical evidence has shown that this particular group of symptoms shows a relatively consistent structure in terms of prognosis and treatment . 
  as you can see from this list , there are several different methods we could use to measure depression . 
  self-report of symptoms like mood and changes in appetite are one method . 
  third party observations ( e.g. , from family or other loved ones ) of symptoms like psychomotor slowing are another method . 
  we can also measure behaviors , such as time spent in bed , frequency of crying spells , frequency of psychiatric hospital admissions , or suicide attempts . 
  each of these measurements are different ways of tapping into the core of the construct of depression . 
  ** creating objective measures **, 
  another key element of studying constructs is creating objective measures . 
  depression itself may be reliant in part on subjective criteria , but for us to study it empirically we need objective definitions . 
  using the criteria above , there have been several attempts to create questionnaires to objectively define who is and is n't depressed . 
  in creating an objective measure , there are a few things to look for . 
  the first is construct validity . 
  that is , does the measure actually test what it says it 's testing ? 
  there 's no use having a depression questionnaire that is asking about eating disorders . 
  the second criteria we use to find a good measure is convergent validity . 
  convergent validity means that the measure relates to other measures that we know are related . 
  for example , we would expect a depression scale to positively correlate with an anxiety scale and negatively correlate with a subjective well-being scale . 
  finally , a good measure has a high level of test-retest reliability . 
  that is , if you 're depressed and take a depression questionnaire one day , your score should be similar ( barring large life changes ) a week later . 
  ** that all still sounds really messy **, 
  unfortunately , humans just * are * messy .
