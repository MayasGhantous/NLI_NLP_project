  i call my girlfriend primcess . 
  yes it 's odd . 
  no it 's not a typo, 
  disintegrates from the heat, 
   shakira implies truthful hips, 
  ftfy, 
  agreed . 
  also , quit posting without telling me how erect you are . 
  i want constant updates damnit, 
  this is breaking news ? 
  have you seen fox news ? 
  you do realise that i 'm going to call you babygirl from now on right ? 
  9pm in aus . 
  prime time for me . 
  my ex got me a job where she was working . 
  about 2 months later , we split up and despite me asking my boss to just roster us at different times he stopped giving her shifts because he wanted to keep me and not her . 
  i felt ** horrible ** . 
  breaking news : girl who lied over and over kept lying . 
  seriously i begged him . 
  i told him that he should just cut my shifts so it did n't hurt her but he said that he 'd been `` planning to talk to her anyway '' . 
  sam badcock, 
  oh . . well i guess that 's true actually . 
  north korea, 
   he also said if i had any black tarry stool i should come back . 
  do n't be an idiot . 
  if you 're trying to find a street or do n't know where you 're going please pull over . 
  do n't drive really slowly while trying to work it out . 
  you seem to know a lot of guys, 
  stop and look it up or let me pass . 
  do n't make me sit behind you while you look . 
  yeh , if people in that lane want to speed it 's their choice . 
  let them pass you if they 're going faster , even if you 're driving at the speed limit . 
  yes and do n't try to skip ahead of the traffic when everyone is ** clearly ** waiting to get through the same single lane point . 
  someone will let you in but you 're still a massive cock . 
  it 's a very , very unsafe place to be and you 're not allowed to * do * anything . 
  same . 
  i 'd rather hit the person in front of me from driving too close than give them a gap . 
  because people get disappeared there . 
  hitchens did a great talk at the commonwealth club about his experiences visiting there ( and iran/iraq ) , was pretty enlightening . 
  except in australia . 
  october is very wet in thailand , especially early in the month . 
  there 's two different ways to do thailand - parties or resorts . 
  just make sure you know where to go for whichever you want to do . 
  anyone who does n't constantly worship the dearleader, 
  it does n't matter what you say , it 's not worth it for them to risk it . 
  you 're at school and have a kid ? 
  so you have to copy-paste to use correct grammar ? 
  and women steal shit using a stroller or her handbag * all * the time . 
  my parents own a retail store and they 've caught a bunch of people shit stolen and sitting under their baby , inside the stroller . 
  why would they add more risk ? 
  `` i lost my scalpel '', 
  change positions, 
  really good fresh vanilla beans . 
  tip of the penis ... do n't ask, 
  hahahahahah ... no, 
  i do n't think you know what coon means . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm more confused by op or this reply, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=pet+peeves&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  because you sorted by ` top ' not by ` new ' . 
  change it to notjesus, 
  which of them is a politician ? 
  breaking news :, 
  michele bachmann is still a backwards fundie . 
  who 's going to be the janitor ? 
  the opposite sex 's genitals, 
  never doing any work . 
  combination, 
  that show is like watching a car crash, 
   climate change is undeniable . 
  it 's not a debate . 
  it is undeniable that climate change is happening . 
  the mechanisms involved ( especially the feedback effects ) and how to best combat are very much up for debate . 
  it 's really important that moving forward we do n't take a knee-jerk reaction and use best scientific practices to fix the problem . 
  while your point about how society views science is valid it does n't change op 's point that it is n't a debate , in the same way that evolution is n't a debate . 
  we need a conversational intolerance of people who espouse clearly false beliefs ( like we would to someone that told us they believed elvis was still alive ) but the ` debate ' about climate change is over . 
  there were a lot of consolations with the carbon tax but at least we 're moving in the right direction . 
  i think the point is n't that the money changes the facts but it affects how laymen understand the science . 
  i need context for this immediately . 
  i 'm torn on this because in what context would someone else compliment her cervix ? 
  you do n't exactly get a great view from the outisde . 
  from your dad ? 
  i do n't have evidence for this but i would assume that some primitive cultures have/had more of a eat when there is food system . 
  my step-dad 's mum came to australia to visit us and we took her to the cricket where there are often chants of `` you are a wanker '' . 
  anyway , after the game we all went out for dinner and while we were all silently eating she asked ( quite loudly ) `` what 's a wanker ? '', 
  correct which is why we have brilliant climate models that track the changes . 
  these models show us that global warming is definitely occurring . 
  exactly , which is why you follow the science . 
  the science is unclear about some factors ( best way to fix it , some of the mechanisms involved , how much damage it will cause etc. ), 
  but it is ** very ** clear that a global warming is occurring . 
  let us know when you work it out, 
  i do n't think it 's absolutely a bad idea but it is generally worth waiting or at least making sure both of you are on the same page ( ie. , what you 're expecting , if you want a relationship or if this is just for fun ) . 
  the point i was trying to make is that it moves in a somewhat predictable pattern ( remember climate is different to weather ) . 
  saying that climate fluctuates implies that you think the issue is that we 're in a current high trend or that it will sort itself out , both of which are patently wrong . 
  did you have a different meaning that i misunderstood ? 
  pmarie has . 
  well the pictures should be arriving in the mail any day now . 
  it wo n't change your life . 
  it 's nice to have in the same way that it 's nice if people laugh at your jokes/find you interesting at a party but if you 're relying on it for your self-esteem you 're in trouble . 
  as i said ... weather and climate are different . 
  climate is about overall trends and we 're actually good at predicting that .
