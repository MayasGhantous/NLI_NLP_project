  also , there 's no evidence it 's healthier and several studies that show the taste benefits are placebo . 
  sustainability and locally bought produce can make a difference but organic is not better . 
  ** edit ** : grammar, 
  thanks . 
  i did understand the metaphor , i just do n't agree with it for many reasons . 
  they 're from new zealand . 
  the interactions with adults are edited out i believe, 
  in that case i humbly apologise . 
  it 's not that it uses mmore it 's that it needs to be tilled several more times . 
  each time you till it gases are released . 
  inner east, 
  i think you 're confused between intelligence and neuroticism, 
  without you i 'd still be a virgin . 
  i have come to clean ze pool, 
  you 're the ** one thousandth ** person to reply that to one of my posts . 
  please click [ here ] ( http://kitten-pictures.com/photopage/fullsize/action-kitten.jpg ) to collect your prize . 
  i do n't know what that stands for . 
  no prize for 1,001 . 
  also , she has significantly increased my seat choosing speed by forcing me to question my beliefs on the issue . 
  * something something something * her inbox . 
  i 'm taking all of the masturbation feats . 
  not really . 
  i honestly think it has value for people who are n't interested in statistics at all . 
  you should also read it if you 're into skepticism , psychology , economics or just want to understand the world better . 
  take mount olympus , and make it better . 
  i 'm not the messiah , i 'm just a very naughty boy . 
  i did when i was single . 
  yeh but having my face stuck on it is just creepy . 
  if you take life too seriously you 'll never make it out alive . 
  this probably requires context/details, 
  almost 24 hours, 
  both days ? 
  my first date with my so, 
  i almost always recommend people seek professional help when they ask mental health , physical health or anything with sufficient gravitas . 
  if you accept relationship advice from anonymous people on reddit it 's almost certain that you 're just listening to what you want to hear anyway . 
  for anyone interested , relationship counselling can be very effective but requires both partners to be invested in the experience and partially responsible for where the relationship is . 
  start some work for college now , get ahead . 
  if you can get your textbooks early , doing 15 minutes a day could put you way ahead of everyone else . 
  otherwise , find small ways to self-improve ; learn to meditate ( ucla has some great instruction for mindfulness meditation ) , learn about some topics you find interesting , get a hobby or hit the gym .

  please consult a professional before you try to do this as hormones have many effects , most of which you probably do n't understand well enough . 
  my point still remains . 
  i 'm not saying that because i thought you were going to operate on yourself , i 'm saying that because you have fairly little idea what effects lowering testosterone will have . 
  for example , if you lower it too much you 'll kill your sperm count and motility . 
  i 'm guessing you do n't want to be sterile . 
  the level of training that personal trainers have varies a lot and are not necessarily experienced in hormones . 
  please see a medical professional if you 're genuinely concerned about it . 
  playboy sales would go through the roof . 
  betamax is the best thing ever, 
  probably . 
  also , realise that your physiological arousal is due to an increase in adrenaline and is not representative of your mood . 
  psych studies have shown that people misattribute physiological arousal for emotions and i think that 's what is happening here . 
  no because like any good jewish family they just all argue loudly over dinner every week . 
  reddit , what 's your biggest pet peeve ? 
  fifth gear is crap, 
  no i think it 's really important that people talk about it . 
  mental disorders are a disease and the stigma attached to seeking treatment ( especially for depression ) stops a lot of people getting help . 
  if me talking about my experiences on reddit helps one person get help for themselves i 'd be ecstatic . 
  sock puppets, 
  i made my so meet my family for a big jewish friday night dinner ( 20 + people ) . 
  if you make it out alive , you 're a keeper . 
  i do n't think any guy considers it cheating if it 's another girl . 
  there 's some seriously freudian shit going on right here . 
  close your porn, 
   does it really mean anything ? 
  i want to be a painter . 
  his brother was a better actor . 
  `` bacardi 151 is never the answer . '', 
  such a relevant username, 
  natural forces , most likely the big bang . 
  do n't be ridiculous , it 's far more likely that a guy who cares about whether or not you touch your penis did it . 
  does he cuddle ? 
  so your way of spiting them is handing them free business ? 
  the year level above us got really out of hand so we were n't allowed to ( anyone participating was n't able to sit exams there ) . 
  hey everyone . 
  this guy makes 103k a year, 
  i 'm partial to an appletini myself, 
  i agree op . 
  american has had more time to develop characters and narratives than the british office , if it had continued it may be a different story . 
  people can just check out my posts on gonewild if they want, 
  it 's not a choice . 
  that being said it 's really important to understand that sexuality and gender are n't binary and exist on a continuum . 
  make sure he knows that you support him and suggest that he sees a professional . 
  tell him that there 's nothing wrong with having a down period and speaking to someone about it can help . 
  i do love a well placed cunt, 
  knob jockey, 
  oh i recognise you . 
  i saw a comic about you the other day . 
  huh ? 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  having a tumor is less of a choice than smoking lots . 
  clearly it exists on a continuum . 
  we need 2 dds, 
  stat, 
  new studies show that being warm ( especially a warm bath ) will make you feel less lonely .

  he 's right people . 
  what if something is in the bible but you think it 's wrong .
