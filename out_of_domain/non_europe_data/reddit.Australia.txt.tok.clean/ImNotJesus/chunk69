  how do you decide what to do ? 
  you do have regular one night stands with tequila bottles though . 
  it 's great to have plans and can be a really good tool but making them too rigid is a way to avoid anxiety and uncertainty . 
  sometimes it 's healthy to have a little bit of unknown , even though it 's scary for people like you and i. 
  melbourne , australia, 
  i believe you 've just described me . 
  the shower head is your friend ? 
  no it just means you need to be more inventive . 
  if desperate , just pretend you 've got stomach issues and head to the bathroom . 
  ca n't i be a creepy brother ? 
  there is a lot of variation in sex drive and he may not have much of one . 
  that being said , there are several factors that can reduce it ; anxiety ( performance issues , intimacy issues etc. 
  ) , hormonal imbalance , stress , overtiredness and some others . 
  you know what they call alternative medicine that has been proven to work ? 
  medicine . 
  take for example tree bark , it actually worked on headaches and therefore became aspirin . 
  if they * could * mass mark it and make billions of dollars why would n't they ? 
  do n't post that , people will know i stole half my answer from it . 
  i 'm not saying he should be sent to jail but the dad claiming he did nothing wrong pisses me off . 
  does n't change the intent . 
  if 10 people spray paint the wall , one extra person does n't make it significantly harder to clean off . 
  does n't make the arbitrarily chosen 10th person any less culpable . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7e-isbgwpk ), 
  i saw the movie of choke , it was pretty terrible . 
  [ this ] ( http://jwsokol.com/scc/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/500full.jpg ) guy is really good . 
  i was tossing up between that and ` high crimes ' but thought that link would be more recognisable . 
  no , just the contraction . 
  the dog chewed on its bone . 
  it 's a bone . 
  edit : used a terrible example . 
  i 've done it before and feel no shame doing it . 
  i have an so but love eating a meal by myself occasionally . 
  sit there with my ipod in and playing on my phone , it 's really nice and relaxing . 
  it will go * okay *, 
  false . 
  this should be upside down . 
  laugh and then nothing . 
  what convinced you of the truth of catholic theology ? 
  i come out of genuine curiosity . 
  i think religion , as a natural phenomenon is absolutely fascinating ( i say this with absolutely no disrespect ) . 
  that 's simply not true , sorry . 
  not trying to say you should define yourself in any particular way but atheism literally means lack of theism . 
  you do n't need conviction that no god exists and most people consider that position impossible anyway . 
  i said that many people take that certain position . 
  personally , i think one can say with sufficient certainty that a certain god does n't exist but not enough to say that no god exists , mainly because of how badly defined the term is without specific characteristics . 
  edit : also , there is n't the same amount of evidence for both . 
  one comes with certain predictions . 
  for example , for the christian god to be real , the earth would have to be 6000 years old . 
  for a lack of belief in god , one must only believe that an omniscient and omnipotent god would n't create a flawed book . 
  it 's a completely different question to say that ` no ' god could possibly exist . 
  a ` cure for cancer ' does n't exist , it is a wide range of diseases . 
  we have good treatments for some and weak treatments for others . 
  ** on ** reddit, 
  that 's so weird , i 've fapped on your grandma 's bed . 
  the weirdest thing is that the priest was fapping at the same time too . 
  i know it sounds random but i finished eating my cereal one morning . 
  calmly walked to the bathroom and started rinsing my bowl in the bathroom sink . 
  i was pretty much finished cleaning it before i realised what i was doing . 
  how old are you ? 
  yeh , it 's simply not true though . 
  research happens in slow concentric circles and while funding is very important no amount of shoving money at the problem creates an instant solution . 
  technically during . 
  how ? 
  oh well in that case it 's just retarded then . 
  i once left a year 12 exam and fapped in the bathroom instead of actually going to the toilet . 
  most reddit downtime can be explained by this . 
  someone told me about listening to ` friday ' by rebecca black . 
  i 'll allow it . 
  i love your ** c ** omparative ** lit ** erature one . 
  hard science, 
  soft science, 
  maths, 
  creative arts, 
  humanities, 
  law and politics, 
  teaching, 
  philosophy, 
  languages, 
  you could even leave a couple of those out since they fit under humanities . 
  i did n't get off from head for ages . 
  there can be big skill disparities and you also need to try and stay relaxed , which is hard if you 've not had great experiences . 
  just try to lie back and focus on the sensation , rather than your thoughts . 
  i 've had a handjob during a crowded harry potter session at the movies . 
  that was awesome . 
  always look on the bright side of life, 
  hard = physics , chem , bio etc. 
  soft = the rest, 
  details please . 
  what book ? 
  there 's plenty of books on ` subconscious stuffs ' that is full of pseudoscience and bullshit . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm a psych student and consume a fuckload of psychology books . 
  i do n't think that anything that says ` subconscious ' is bullshit but some certainly are . 
  the subconscious is all mental function that we are n't aware of . 
  what we 're realising at the moment is that our conscious awareness takes in very little of what we process . 
  for example , if you looked at two pictures of the same girl , one with her eyes artificially dilated , you would consider he significantly more attractive but not know why . 
  the subconscious is super important for psychology because it 's pretty much what does everything , our conscious thought just comes along for the ride . 
  does that make sense ? 
  have n't seen the show so i ca n't talk on specifics . 
  there are some theories that say that we remember everything that we convert from working memory ( you may know it as short-term memory , the name changed a while ago ) to long term memory . 
  however , if that were the case , the problem is that our memories are very fallible because of several factors ( our limited eyesight , added meaning , cognitive shortcuts etc. ) .
