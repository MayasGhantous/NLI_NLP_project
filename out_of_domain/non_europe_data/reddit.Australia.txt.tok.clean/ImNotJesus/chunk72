  quit smoking bud ? 
  while we 're at it ; i really , really , really do n't care who you just visited unless it 's someone famous and interesting . 
  if you went to your friend 's house , it 's fair to assume no-one cares . 
  so meta , complaining about not being able to complain . 
  i commend you sir . 
  it 's a government conspiracy to keep the libertarian , pro-drug and anti-cop redditors from spreading their messages .

  i read that as `` colour you nude '' and thought you were asking for a painting for me naked . 
  words can hurt too, 
  yes they change and no that does n't downgrade them . 
  the great things about morals is that they ** are n't ** finite rules that fit in every situation . 
  rules that are inflexible are do n't change is called dogmatism , not morality . 
  we need pics of this ... for verification . 
  online dating . 
  worked for me . 
  i worked with a guy named sam badcock . 
  i ca n't remember the surname but i once called a guy at work whose first name was `` hardeep '' . 
  get ready to fight ... a lot . 
  if that has happened between women successfully we 'll need pictures for verification . 
  that if i were ever in the military , opposing 13 year olds will probably kill me . 
  nice try . . 
  the best part about zeitgeist is turning it off . 
  a blue one and a green one . 
  context ? 
  irrespective of the legality , having tattoos will change people 's first perception of you and in most cases negatively affect your chance of getting a job . 
  sock puppets, 
  glitter, 
  do n't take it too personally . 
  i suffered from a really severe depression and although some of my friends knew and were really supportive they occasionally said insensitive things because they did n't think . 
  do n't let it get you down . 
  and it was reddit + the day before . 
  because my first name is far more common than my surname . 
  are you sure you 're looking in the right places ? 
  where are you meeting girls ? 
  it 's far worse to wait until september than it is to do it over the phone . 
  having worked in an office with 4 mormons , i really would n't like to go to a state full of them . 
  your grandmother is amazing . 
  i lightly tease my grandparents and it always makes them giggle . 
  my current one .

  also , they 're a charity so i 'm earning money for a charity and pay significantly less tax . 
  you have n't sabotaged ours . 
  i still love you . 
  are you seeing a psychologist at the same time ? 
  me too . 
  i 'm on reddit a fair bit and went through a long depression . 
  happy to help out if needed . 
  maybe they 're just in a different stage of life to you now . 
   what 's kraken with you ? 
  i 'll let myself out . 
  i realised how easy this is to perpetuate a couple of days ago . 
  i was talking to a girl in my tute and we got on really well . 
  later that day we had a lecture together and she did n't sit next to me . 
  i instantly assumed it was because i was n't good looking enough even though she walked in with a friend , i have an so and we 'd only talked for about 5 minutes . 
  i ** love ** my cruise control . 
  you 're a champ, 
  for how erect you are ? 
  do you mind me asking if you 've seen a psychologist about this ? 
  i get about 80 `` nice try , jesus '' replies a day . 
  it 's relatively annoying . 
  it may be different in america but i 'm fairly sure you do n't legally have to tell them . 
  doctor/patient privilege . 
  anyway , it worked wonders for me when i was depressed so if you ever want to talk about it feel free to pm me .

  i understand but the offer stands . 
  sorry to hear that . 
  really hope it gets sorted out . 
  i do n't really understand the question . 
  is she asking if the universe is like a bubble ? 
  also , a lot of mental disorders have symptoms that make it harder for the person experiencing the symptoms to realise what 's going on . 
  schizophrenia for example often comes with delusions ( there is a fairly big range in schizophrenia ) and by nature it can be hard to realise they are delusions because they feel real to the person experiencing them . 
  you have schizophrenia ? 
  uhhh ... name one . 
  i had tonsilitis for my birthday this year . 
  had to cancel a reservation for one of the best restaurants around that my so made for me .

  how is that spreading like a disease ? 
  also , why would you want to ? 
  anti-psychotic meds suck . 
  do you say this to someone who has just tripped ? 
  i know ... 
  i can see . 
  wow, 
  if one more person replies `` nice try , jesus '' to my post i 'm going to headbutt myself in the face . 
  or that community episode, 
  there 's something fishy about your account name . 
  hmmm ... probably should 've seen that coming . 
  it 's not weird . 
  it 's my standard reddit boner . 
  hannibal movies, 
  seriously , i post helpful and well researched shit all the time on askreddit . 
  my highest upvoted post was about peeing in the shower . 
  they love you and would want you to talk to them . 
  i know it seems dark down but you 'll find a way through . 
  i had some really tough times and had some similar thoughts and now i 'm happier than i 've ever been . 
  please just hold on , it wo n't ever feel as hard as it does right now while it 's all so fresh .
