  going back to 0 would be really , really hard though . 
  why so angry ? 
  who hurt you ? 
  much appreciated . 
  thanks !, 
  does n't bother me . 
  i do n't care about the karma itself , i was more just thinking about how much time it means i 've spent on here . 
  going to phuket in a couple of months !, 
  so excited . 
  a few people seem to be doing that as a response ( i 've now hit 50,000 3 times ) . 
  i really do n't care about the karma itself , it was just making me wonder about how much time i spend on here . 
  haha thanks . 
  i think we 're staying near kata for the first week and then we 're going to coconut island for the second . 
  the highest honour !, 
  oh man , my dad is exactly the same . 
  the only difference is that he believes that he 's `` really good at finding spots out the front '' . 
  i 'm so risk averse when finding spots now , i take the first one i see , especially if it 's one of those awesome spots where the opposite one is free and you can drive through to be facing the right way . 
  i swear i cum a little every time i park in one of those spots . 
  i 've had weird looks from people for thanking the bus/tram driver . 
  you are evil . 
  the crowd were surprised but not totally against his over the top touchdown celebration . 
  we always hurt the ones we love . 
  i get that a lot . 
  typing `` jennifer anniston 's boobs '' into yahoo after my auntie 's wedding . 
  really ? 
  you looked at naked girls first ? 
  do you still think about lesbians some times ? 
  listen . 
  repeat key words . 
  ask open questions . 
  have you ever been with a lesbian ? 
  might need pics for verification . 
  no you do n't get it . 
  it 's really important to listen to them . 
  details ? 
  for ... for science, 
  i 'm going to need a moment alone . 
  nice try , out of ideas macdonalds marketing guy . 
  this is n't what most brothers talk to their sisters about ? 
  well , you see , some people are cocks . 
  words can hurt too you know . 
  i could call you an alcoholic right now but i 'm going to take the moral high ground . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm a really good person . 
  i have no doubt that there is an endless supply of people who want to know what my biggest pet peeve is . 
  any holes a goal, 
  people asking what my pet peeve is . 
  that 's okay , i have a special place in my heart for alpaca farmers . 
  yeh , from experience you also want to warn her if you 're going to yell out `` ka me haaaaaaaa me haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa '' as you cum . 
  do n't say corporal punishment is bad on reddit unless you want to get downvoted into oblivion . 
  it 's kind of bizarre . 
  nice try , fbi guy . 
  mom , you 're drunk . 
  dad left years ago . 
  you need to stop drinking . 
  totally different . 
  long haul , i 'm choosing marriage though . 
  my parents had unprotected sex and conceived me . 
  how the fuck are you sitting on the toilet that that happens ? 
  mom , i love you no matter what . 
  i 'll stand by you . 
  the meaning of life is that there is no meaning , it 's just what we create . 
  it 's frighteningly arbitrary and the odds of me having ever existed are cosmically small . 
  yet here i am , typing on my laptop , having feelings . 
  my life has meaning because i feel . 
  that * is * the meaning . 
  i keep telling people that . 
  flowers by irene ? 
  your wishlist for santa, 
  huh ? 
  who said it 's boring ? 
  that 's fucking exciting to me . 
  i 've got a whole life to play with , to make meaning and change the world . 
  i 'm really glad there 's no higher order , i get to make my meaning . 
  this is mean . 
  i said there is no ** greater ** meaning . 
  i said that we do n't need some universal truth for it to mean something . 
  what if me having day to day experiences is meaning ? 
  what if me changing the world for the better and creating a legacy is meaning ? 
  what if loving and being loved is meaning ? 
  does n't that mean so much more ? 
  is n't that ** so ** much more real ? 
  just a naughty boy . 
  you like science and ufos ? 
  most science podcasts i know make fun of people that like ufos . 
  oh god this annoys me so much . 
  if you 're producing * better * content people will upvote that . 
  reddit has close to 800,00 accounts ( i know there are some double ups but still ) and not everyone has seen that same post from a month ago you saw . 
  if it gets to the top , enough people want to see it . 
  get off your internet high horse . 
  people who say : `` i know i 'm going to be downvoted to oblivion for this but ... '', 
  if you say something interesting/funny/thought provoking i 'll upvote you , if you put 18 caveats on what you say i 'm going to downvote you regardless . 
  the saddest thing is that it seems to work . 
  eat stem cells, 
  losing my faith in god . 
  worked out for the best though . 
  rent money is dead money !, 
  find ** good ** scientific information on the internet . 
  when i was 17 i was waiting in line to use a shower at a music festival . 
  a woman ( in the line for the men 's bathroom ) , after saying nothing to me for the 5 minutes she 'd been standing in front of me in line and brushing her teeth , poked me in the stomach with the back of her toothbrush and said `` bit chubby there are n't we ? '' .
