  try to think of something special for her . 
  i had my anniversary with my so yesterday and she ** loves ** slurpees , especially in the morning . 
  all i did was wake her up with one and she was ecstatic . 
  do n't worry baby , i 'll do the dishes , you just go to bed . 
  melted, 
  i 'd never changed a light globe until i moved in with my so . 
  she laughed . 
  a lot . 
  ** edit ** : light globe = light bulb, 
  * not sure if culturally specific word or being trolled *, 
  nice try , creepy stalker guy, 
  same thing ... woops . 
  editted . 
  god i hate you . 
  because then i ca n't listen to you pee and it makes it take longer for me to masturbate . 
  i think i could enjoy 24 hours straight of punching dr. oz in the cock . 
  fine !, 
  i do n't hate you . 
  also , i 've learned that you ca n't go to the bathroom in an elevator . 
  that was awkward . 
  then why does he need to avoid a breathaliser ? 
  i 've done it before . 
  my ex had mild ocd and it was the only way i could get head . 
  my bank balance had four 0s at the end of it . 
  most likely it 's a way of protecting yourself by ensuring you ca n't get too close to a guy . 
  either that or you 're trying to prove your self-worth by wanting a guy to leave his so for you . 
  either way it 's going to hurt your long-term happiness and should talk to a psychologist about it . 
  it 's also called dollars and it 's stronger than the american dollar right now . 
  no disagreement , just seemed like a good place for an anecdote, 
  it wo n't help . 
  sorry for your loss but this will probably make you feel worse, 
  sounds like anxiety . 
  if you have a chance , go focus on your breathing with your eyes closed for a minute . 
  if you 're already making out try focus on the sensations . 
  the more you 're in your own head the worse it will be . 
  narrow your focus, 
  what are tomorrows lottery numbers ? 
  i 'm straight and have ... 
  there is some human interaction , it 's just over very quickly . 
  living the dream , pal . 
  living the dream . 
  in fact , the concept was pretty much thrown out years ago .

  some of what he says is brilliant . 
  other parts are ludicrous and sensationalised . 
  it was making it really easy to do nothing with my life, 
  i 've read his basketball book cover to cover . 
  i 'm a huge nba nerd . 
  he 's so polite, 
  a fresh vanilla bean is amazing . 
  south park, 
  what the fuck ?? 
  either he 's setting world records or he 's getting some seriously overpriced stuff .

  i would assume in some cases it 's due to the anxiety involved in life changes but you 're making a huge assumption that that pattern exists and i highly doubt it 's supported by data . 
  yeh . 
  became a really easy way to quieten the world . 
  i know it is n't the same for everyone but that 's why * i * quit . 
  yeh but one extra zero is like $ 36 for the next few days, 
  buy some good pots and pans . 
  makes cooking and cleaning * much * easier ( plus you need less oil ) and will actually save you money in the long run . 
  i win cuz my self esteem is so low that i need validation from people on the internet despite having someone who wants to be with me, 
  from my experience `` nice cans '' gets you slapped a lot . 
  because i handwrite things once every few months, 
  this is askreddit . 
  you 're looking for r/lamejokes, 
  i almost always use my best grammars . 
  atheism/religion questions tend to not get that highly upvoted on askreddit . 
  i think pro-reasoning is a very loaded term ( equally so with anti-god ) . 
  it 's a shame that people misunderstand the terms atheism and agnosticism so much . 
  if you 're religious , you 're still an atheist in respect to thousands of other gods . 
  it does n't mean you can prove a specific god does n't exist , it just means you do n't believe it . 
  atheist is a great term , it just needs to be better understood . 
  i wanted cookiedoughcooter for obvious reasons, 
  very much my experience, 
  it does work in some ways but not in others . 
  stage hypnotism is bullshit . 
  it 's just suggestion plus compliance due to social pressures . 
  past-life regression and all that woo bullshit is obviously crap too . 
  however , hypnotism as a form of guided meditation is very valuable and has clinical applications . 
  i 've learned how to do this form of hypnotism but have n't tried it on anyone yet . 
  if you 're interested , read/listen to derren brown 's book on hypnotism . 
  you need to seek clinical ( psychologist ) help . 
  there are aversion therapies that can be very effective for even the most severe phobias . 
  i just threw up in my mouth, 
  that really depends on how important it is to you . 
  there 's a form of aversion therapy that only takes 3 hours ( it 's very intense though ) . 
  basically what happens is that you 're slowly moved towards being able to interact with your fear . 
  let 's say you have a fear of spiders . 
  the first step is to get you to think about a spider . 
  if you get anxious you 're encouraged to breathe and relax . 
  once you 're calm again you might look at a picture of a spider . 
  again you 're encouraged to breathe and relax . 
  slowly you work towards touching or being right next to one . 
  it does work but it 's pretty challenging . 
  that 's a terrible idea . 
  firstly , it would disrupt your sleep . 
  secondly , it would n't still be affecting you in the morning . 
  they 're often used in different sorts of therapy and can be of good value , not just in dealing with upset but also planning for the future ( ie .
