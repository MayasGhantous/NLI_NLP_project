  in fact many , many studies have even shown that you 'll enjoy spending your money on other people more than you will spending it on yourself . 
  this one is common on reddit and i 'll be buried quite quickly for saying it but ... that spanking your children is okay . 
  from the apa 's ( american psychological association ) compilation of ** 62 years ** of studies ( emphasis mine ) :, 
   while conducting the meta-analysis , which included 62 years of collected data , gershoff looked for associations between parental use of corporal punishment and 11 child behaviors and experiences , including several in childhood ( immediate compliance , moral internalization , quality of relationship with parent , and physical abuse from that parent ) , three in both childhood and adulthood ( mental health , aggression , and criminal or antisocial behavior ) and one in adulthood alone ( abuse of own children or spouse ) . 
   gershoff found `` strong associations '' between corporal punishment and all eleven child behaviors and experiences . 
  ** ten of the associations were negative ** such as with increased child aggression and antisocial behavior . 
  the single desirable association was between corporal punishment and increased immediate compliance on the part of the child . 
  in fact , they go on to say that the only defence of corporal punishment is that * less * corporal punishment is * less * bad for the child . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : please do n't hit your kids . 
  you 're not supposed to give your time and then all of a sudden feel amazing . 
  it has a small effect that makes you feel generally better about yourself . 
  i had an fwb situation that i tried to convince myself was awesome ( because guys are supposed to want to be able to have lots of carefree sex ) . 
  i felt shit about myself . 
  i hated it . 
  i think if you 've experienced loving sex , you can tell there 's a difference . 
  wait . 
  what ? 
  how ? 
  i think it 'd be great if , as a culture , we were n't okay with people talking about objective truths as a matter of personal opinion or being ` open minded ' . 
  if you want a midget to spank you while you spin in circles singing ` hakuna matata ' that 's your personal choice and i hope you have a wonderful time . 
  if you tell me that homeopathy works or that you can talk to dead people , you should be laughed at . 
  steer clear folks . 
  you do n't want to be hit with the downvote shrapnel . 
  if being gay is a choice , so is being straight . 
  prove it 's a choice by sucking another guy 's cock ... go on . 
  oh ... well ... in that case . 
  that certainly is more sensitive . 
  she said that she loves you too and that you should probably get tested for chlamydia, 
  it seemed mean . 
  i 'm too mean to you . 
  learning to communicate and accomodate two different people 's wants/needs/habits / eccentricities . 
  ( according to my relationship psych subject ) the best predictor of a satisfying relationship is n't the number of conflicts , it 's how good the couple is as fighting that matters . 
  they 'll be too busy writing shakespeare to help her, 
  answer the door naked or try to sell them a toaster, 
  pantry always worked at my grandparents house , plus there were plenty of snacks if it was a long game . 
  do n't invite anyone and tell him that it 's full of ninjas, 
  not true at all . 
  the forefathers were very secular by the standard of the time . 
  most of them would 've been considered deists ( which is an understandable position given we had almost no knowledge of how the universe started ) . 
  practice . 
  it 's all practice . 
  they feel better over time . 
  jewish . 
  yes , i 'm now an atheist . 
  god is a combination of wishful thinking and the leftovers from a time where we did n't have better answers to the big questions . 
  no , i am my brain . 
  when my brain stops working , i no longer exist . 
  `` i do not fear death . 
  i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born , and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it . '', 
  suffered from a severe depression . 
  it made me believe , even stronger , that i need to take control over my own life and supernatural belief takes away from my own strength and meaning . 
  my atheism has helped me through many times by helping me define myself in a positive way . 
  i thought i 'd had a few prayers answered as a kid but they 're very easily explained . 
  none , now . 
  damn , i used the american spelling , think i 'd be all sneaky and pretend i was american too . 
  apparently , i 'm not very bright or way too sleepy to realise what i did . 
  grey cubicles . 
  i have a nice window and a spare computer for redditting though . 
  shhhh . 
  i woke up at 5:30 this morning to get to work . 
  my brain no work so good, 
  you do n't want to rush into an orifice too fast . 
  people who do n't respect scientific knowledge drive me up the wall . 
  i do n't care if you * feel * like your homeopath is good , if he 's not using science based medicine he 's an asshole charlatan, 
  i assume which one i am changes every 30 minutes or so ? 
  you need to tell her that a therapist-patient relationship is about finding a good match . 
  if that one did n't work for her she should try to find a new one ( it sounds like the therapist was n't very good ) . 
  also , there are different styles of therapy and some work better for certain people than others . 
  a lot of therapists will only know how to use psychodynamic therapy or cbt when the reality is that she should know both . 
  you ca n't ` try ' the placebo effect . 
  either something works or it does n't work . 
  relying on the placebo effect to fix a patient still makes you a lying asshole even if they receive minimal benefit . 
  also , the placebo effect is very hard to measure because we have many cognitive biases and a faulty memory system that will sometimes overrate the actual good done . 
  it would bounce, 
  because you have absolutely no idea what you 're receiving . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://whatstheharm.net/ ) why you do n't ` give it a try ' . 
  by definition , none . 
  if it 's proven , it 's no longer supernatural . 
  a homophone is a gay hotline right ? 
  eating a handful of pepper . 
  funniest i 've ever seen though : covnince one of your friends to try and swallow a tablespoon full of cinnamon without any water . 
  i promise you will piss yourself laughing . 
  racism is always funny , especially when it 's a dominant group because no-one thinks it 's racist . 
  penis, 
  do what i did . 
  find someone who looks friendly , sit down next to them and say `` hi , i 'm ceilingcatisnotwall . '', 
  why not just eat a teaspoon of sugar ? 
  it 's much cheaper and at least you wo n't be supporting someone who is misleading * other * people . 
  if it 's proven to exist and we do n't know the natural cause it is n't assumed to be supernatural , we just assume we do n't know the natural cause * yet * . 
  by your definition we should consider a bunch of physics supernatural until we know the exact cause . 
  heights . 
  even thinking about it makes me feel nauseous . 
  therapy is somewhat more productive than throwing yourself in front of a train . 
  there are several types of reasoning people use . 
  the one i best understand is the idea that we have very little understanding of our unconscious mind . 
  for example , if you were to look at two pictures of the same girl , you 'd be more attracted to the woman whose eyes are slightly dilated and have no idea that that 's why you were doing it . 
  since we identify our free will by our conscious awareness , it makes sense that our free will is an illusion or at least limited . 
  my stance is that free will probably * is * an illusion ( to some degree anyway ) but that the illusion of free will is indistinguishable from genuine free will ( whatever that actually means ) so it 's moot anyway . 
  quantum phsyics does through a spanner into the works of biological determinism though . 
  i think about 30 .
