  i highly recommend talking to a professional about this because anxiety issues can be very debilitating . 
  however , treatment normally is n't that complicated and you can be helped . 
  if that 's not affordable , try some mindfulness meditation . 
  you can get some great intro level stuff through ucla . 
  i do n't hate religious people . 
  i hate religion and i hate religious people who try to convert/affect public policy or pretend they know things that they ca n't with absolute certainty . 
  there 's a big difference . 
  edit : to be clear , when i say affect public policy i mean that it 's not okay to say `` i think we should n't allow gay marriage because it says so in the bible '' . 
  the conversation should n't end their and your opinion should n't matter simply because you believe it to be true from a religious text . 
  if you say that we should n't allow gay marriage because it says so in the bible ** and ** give me valid reasons , then i 'll listen to you . 
  akathisia is normally associated with side-effects or withdrawal and is n't generally found as a syndrome by itself ( from my understanding and your wiki link seems to agree ), 
  i would 've lost my virginity at a much older age if i never had sex while my parents were home . 
  use internet explorer, 
  have nice food and beers . 
  people will have a good time . 
  leading question is leading, 
  while technically you 're right , for all intents and purposes it is . 
  there are n't articles refuting global warming in any reputable journals . 
  to some extent yes but our change in global climate is outside the predicted range that is due to natural factors . 
  what does he not agree with or not believe ? 
  you have n't given us anywhere near enough information . 
  if it is seriously hurting your chances of having a happy relationship please seek professional help instead of consulting anonymous strangers on the internet . 
  it 's called an avoidant attachment style and it 's something you should talk about with someone who knows what they 're doing . 
  [ enjoy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=bucket&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  quality life lesson, 
  i was saying enjoy the link, 
  well then show him a scientific paper and if he does n't believe it then give up , you 're not going to be able to convince him . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/search?q=pet+peeve&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance ), 
  there 's really fascinating research on attachment theory and how it relates to coping styles, 
  so many things wrong with that statement . 
  1 ) atheism is n't faith , it 's a lack of faith . 
  does it require faith to believe that there is n't an invisible pink unicorn orbiting the earth ? 
  2 ) inductive logic is better than no logic . 
  it 's also objective and quantifiable . 
  3 ) atheists are n't a homogenous group . 
  i have no issues with christians affecting public policy . 
  i have issue with christians using their religion as a reason public policy should be changed . 
  wrong, 
  [ video it 's actually from ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypvvnrv1tow ), 
  besides the fact that christianity is demonstrably false , it 's because it 's not your job to tell me how to live my fucking life . 
  you 're lucky, 
  nah , i have a bunch of reasons why someone should like me . 
  mainly my humility . 
  do n't try to fix her . 
  be consistent and supportive and let her get there in her own time . 
  the more you pressure her , the longer that will take . 
  truth : why are we playing this game when we 're not 12 ? 
  i get that . 
  my so used to be pretty jealous but she * is * getting better over time and at least recognises it now . 
  i get why you would take it personally that she does n't completely trust you too , even though you intellectually understand why . 
  unfortunately , there 's no amount of convincing that will change it for her , you just need to be consistent in showing her that she can trust you . 
  if you love her , keep trying . 
  i know it 's tough mate , sorry . 
  try to stop him from masturbating so i can give him some advice . 
  that 's like saying : `` if people believe cannibalism is unethical , why do we eat animal meat ? '', 
  hi , i 'd like to nominate you for the ` worst thread of the month award ' . 
  anti-psychotics have very bad side-effects and that 's why a lot of schizophrenics stop taking them . 
  that being said , you ** must ** go off them under the supervision of a professional . 
  there are side-effects and withdrawals and you will need help/support and you may be better off slowly reducing the dose to see if your psychotic symptoms are being treated by the meds or are gone . 
  please , do n't just stop taking them . 
  no they do n't . 
  not in their lifetime . 
  edited my post to address it, 
  no one is proposing a change in the name of atheism . 
  there 's a difference between that and a separation of church and state, 
  it feels like you 're a truly loveable and valuable person . 
  there are n't many feelings more amazing than feeling genuinely loved . 
  and i have absolutely no problem with you . 
  i hope you live a long and happy life and if christianity is the best way for you to do that , best of luck to you . 
  my quibble is with people who say the bible is evidence for scientific fact or sufficient to affect public policy and with people who proselytise , not with you as a person . 
  that 's why i ** specifically stated ** who i do and do n't have a problem with ... 
  you 're going for ` entrapment ', 
  not hang out with them anymore ? 
  so just ignore him, 
   i do n't hate religious people . 
  i do n't really know how much more clear i could have been . 
  then we can be friends !, 
  at least we 've narrowed it down a bit, 
  clambake ? 
  `` that 's okay , we can just cuddle '', 
  [ for those who do n't know what a daisy chain is ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=daisy+chain ),

  one old lady does n't get the message and decides the election, 
  i helped out a nigerian prince, 
  well , it all started when i got an e-mail from this nigerian guy . 
  if you 're genuinely suicidal please seek professional help . 
  what are you doing with tha ... 
  i do n't believe that, 
  worst thread idea ever, 
  my phenomenal humility, 
  you almost certainly do n't have cancer . 
  do n't diagnose yourself with terminal illnesses on the internet , it 's really stupid . 
  jeans too tight ? 
  did he ? 
  does she have proof ? 
  it 's kind of important . 
  yeh but i 'm a 16 year old girl in other personas, 
  i just got so angry from reading that . 
  think about the task . 
  stop and do something cognitively taxing ( like anagrams or a stroop task if you can find one on the net ) and then go back to the activity .
