  also , get a piece of art that has several arrows pointing in one direction and then one pointing in the other direction . 
  if you ca n't find it , paint it yourself . 
  ( both proven to work in experimental conditions ), 
  it 's generally accepted in psychology that sexuality and gender are both on a continuum . 
  well , then he 's probably fucked . 
  nice try , my creepy uncle, 
  i breast fed until i was 12 . 
  i started getting erections and it got weird . 
  i like you because you spell it colo ** u ** r, 
  i 'm at work right now . 
  i think about answers to askreddit questions, 
  am i allowed to wish for money and then give some away ? 
  just kidding , of course it is n't, 
  it 's not about conscience , i would genuinely enjoy my wishes more if they were also somewhat charitable . 
  ca n't i be selfishly charitable ? 
  if she refuses to deal with it herself then you have no other choice . 
  exactly !, 
  fluid , bed rest and antibiotics if the doctor recommends it . 
  it could be an anxiety issue . 
  maybe talk to a therapist about it ? 
  they even talked about it on this documentary i saw ... shit what was it called ? 
  modern family , that 's it . 
  that 's good of you , we do n't want to make this issue any harder to talk about . 
  he 's right guys , do n't cock around with the issue . 
  it desensitized me to all sorts of horrors and nakedness, 
  [ bora bora ] ( http://www.fourseasons.com/images/generated/property/borabora/landing_pages/basics_welcome.jpg ), 
  probably , depends who it was and chances of getting caught .

  they 've probably cavity searched each other many times . 
  are you imagining your uncle 's hand inside your auntie 's vagina ? 
  flying cars . 
  at least, 
  by having an intelligent and well-formed opinion, 
  my so likes it because i occassionally use it to read her funny shit or show her pictures of cute animals . 
  sorry baby , i 've got a headache, 
  because it goes too far and denies a basic tenet of humanity - people need incentives to work hard . 
  i do n't rock up to my job for the good of the state and it 's certainly not the reason i work hard at it . 
  some social support is ** integral ** to a working democracy and capitalist system but too much breaks the system . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i have actually heard `` i 'm really sorry , i swear i was tested recently '' . 
  luckily it was curable . 
  right . 
  read the texts and develop a well-formed opinion , not get talking points from people on the internet . 
  his teacher would destroy him if he did that . 
  turn up, 
  call the cops, 
  it certainly is a basic tenet that people need motivations for their actions ; they 're conscious creatures . 
  also , i never said that socialism has * no * incentives , i just said that people need incentives to work hard and not enough of them hurts the economy . 
  people kept getting me confused . 
  any exercise but make it regular . 
  omega 3 . 
  cut out animal fats , only use olive oil . 
  red wine is good but only small amounts . 
  ** if it does n't go down , take the pills . 
  do n't fuck around with high cholesterol . 
  i wish i could say something cool like rock climbing at 90 but there 's a fairly good chance it 'll be heart attack/stroke . 
  i ca n't remember which comedian said it , but if they really worked you would see guys walkign down the street using shopping trolleys to cart around their cock . 
  twilight . 
  it 'd be kind of awkward for her, 
  hannibal movies with a nice chianti, 
  ice cream out of the tub for dessert ? 
  have you been drinking more regularly ? 
  new studies show that regular drinking further decreases activity in the prefrontal cortex ( planning and morality area ) . 
  also , do you have more rage at the moment ? 
  please stop drinking before you really ruin your or someone else 's life . 
  same actually . 
  when i broke up with my ex i exercised like a fucking madman . 
  put out my back really badly too haha, 
  macbeth, 
  i fart in front of her all the time . 
  loud and proud baby . 
  she does from time to time but farts far less than i do . 
  then stop drinking right now . 
  it is ** not ** a good coping strategy and you 're going to make your situation worse . 
  please see a professional if it 's possible or find a more productive way to deal with your stress ( exercise , mindfulness meditation , new hobby etc. ), 
  because you 're going to sink deeper . 
  easiest question ever ? 
  and you 're a condescending cock, 
  it 's a complicated question because most mental illnesses have symptoms that affect all people but to different degrees . 
  for that reason , they are normally defined by whether those symptoms ( ie. , prolonged sadnses ) affect the day-to-day life of the sufferer . 
  so , by the dsm 's ( diagnostic and statistics manual - the bible for mental health people ) definition one can be cured of depression , yes . 
  however , even a ` cured ' person will have down days and will have times where they do n't feel like themselves , as all people do . 
  one of the hardest things about being post-depression is the constant fear that you can go back there . 
  in summary though , yes it can be treated and essentially cured but no-one is ever completely free of mental health symptoms . 
  tl ; dr it 's complicated but yes . 
  psychology , the mind and teaching other people about them . 
  one day i 'll be a clinician and probably write a few books too . 
  best : meeting so many new people, 
  worst : so many distractions from all the new people you meet . 
  `` just keep playing playstation , i 'll cook dinner '', 
  `` oh shit , i ca n't believe it 's [ time ] , i got ta head off but it was nice chatting to you '', 
  my so bought me fallout : new vegas as a present for finishing my exams despite having glandular fever ( mono ) during the semester . 
  i 'll marry the shit out of her . 
  beat up the kids from cobra kai, 
  because i think you 'll get violent again . 
  also , if you 're drinking * because * of the bad shit that 's going on in your life , it will make the bad shit worse . 
  it 's a terrible coping strategy .
