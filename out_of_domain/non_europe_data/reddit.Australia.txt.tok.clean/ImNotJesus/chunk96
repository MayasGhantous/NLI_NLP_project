  fuck that . 
  i only work weekends and get paid 1.5 x and 2.0 x pay on sat/sunday . 
  it rocks, 
  it 's from an episode of angel called ` epiphany ' . 
  if you watch the episiode knowing the joss whedon is an atheist it 's really clever . 
  i 've done worse , it just was n't technically a first date . 
  they would need a decent sized team to read through them all but there would be enough to get me convicted of several international felonies .

  you have to be happy in yourself . 
  it depends on whether they have free will and the capacity to feel . 
  people stop complaining about reposts and the quality of the content . 
  reddit is not there just for you . 
  it 's not your personal page where people only link things you want to see all the time . 
  it 's a very pure democratic system where the ** majority ** see the content they want to see . 
  i do n't care if you 've seen it before and i do n't care if you 're sick of that meme . 
  you 're not the king of the internet and not everyone sees all the content that 's on reddit , it 's not possible . 
  if it gets to the front page ** it means people want to see it ** .

  you would n't even feel general satisfaction for your achievements . 
  how boring . 
  that really depends on the medication . 
  benzodiazepines do to some extent but ssris , snris and maois should n't . 
  if someone has that reaction , unless they 're suicidal and it 's necessary , they should reconfigure their treatment plan . 
  search for ucla mindfulness on itunes and they have some guided meditations you can try .

  who says life is a competition ? 
  also , i could give you 100 studies that say you 're happier and healthier with good social relatinships . 
  good luck having them as a sociopath . 
  go to r/politicaldiscussion, 
  you 're taking a very narrow view of the word . 
  if you 're talking just from a survival perspective you 're ** far ** better off with functional communities than having people who cheat . 
  that 's why we have evolved to dislike cheaters .

  babe : pig in the city, 
  you can keep it if you were there on a date or got some sort of sexual pleasure as a direct result of going . 
  there are some great intro guided meditations you can get through ucla for free ( just go to their website or look them up on itunes ) .

  just started . 
  it takes a lot of practice but i think so . 
  good job threatening me but you 're going for my nuts ? 
  tsk tsk tsk . 
  you 've got a long way to go . 
  do your own homework, 
  one big thing to look out for is what 's called the [ availability heuristic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/availability_heuristic ) . 
  basically what it means is that we over-estimate the prevalence of something based on how quickly examples of it come to mind ( for example , do you think there are more words starting with the letter ` r ' or with ` r ' as the third letter . 
  because it 's easier to think of the former we naturally lean towards it but the truth is the latter by a huge margin ) . 
  the reason that it 's very important is that we have an over-saturated media presence where we constantly hear about all the ills of the world and we naturally assume that it equals a high prevalence . 
  as with most issues , you should try to find the most objective measures you can . 
  i know that did n't directly answer your question but i 'm hoping a bit of theory can help guide you . 
  he would 've had a heart attack due to the increased stress and sarah palin would be president . 
  that picture seems mildly racist,

  also , there are definitely things you can do to lower the reduction and you gain more enjoyment in other parts of the relationship . 
  he was at the client 's house at the time . 
  always liked it , just more proud to admit it now . 
  i assume that he had naked pictures on his phone that he was masturbating to . 
  pfft , do you know nothing about masturbating at your client 's house ? 
  well if you 'd just masturbated in the first place , you would n't have that problem now , would you ? 
  i hate when the sodium pentathol starts wearing off .
