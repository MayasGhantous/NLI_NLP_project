  i 'm really sorry . 
  you [ can !, 
  i believe there 's a 2 conviction minimum to buy a membership, 
  because your religious belief should be completely separate from what they do as a politician . 
  i would never not vote for someone if they said that they were a christian . 
  however , if they said that they used the bible as a source of guidance for public policy there is no way i would . 
  let me put it to you this way , would you vote for me if i told you that when i was unsure about what i should do , i read through lord of the rings and think `` what would frodo do ? '', 
  it 's so funny because he did that thing it said in his name . 
  so clever . 
  no-one on reddit does that . 
  * bark *, 
  just commentate on what you 're liking . 
  `` ooo i love when you touch me there '', 
  `` yeh , i love how you ... '', 
  `` you 're so ... '', 
  positive way of dealing with the issue . 
  negative way of dealing with the issue . 
  hi , you must be new . 
  we ran out of things to talk about a while back so it 's pretty much just commentary on the front page and circle jerking, 
  it 's never lupus . 
  ps : if you 're seriously worried , go see a doctor . 
  we are n't professionals and ca n't examine you . 
  the strongest feeling for me is one of safety . 
  it 's like , no matter what i do , she 'll still love me and it 'll all be okay . 
  because of that safety i feel stronger to try new challenges and be vulnerable because i know i 'll have her to hug me at the end of the day . 
  i could n't be half the man i am without her . 
  ** edit ** : i think that being loved feels a little bit different for everyone because the other person fills in the gaps of what you feel like you 've missed . 
  i 've never felt safe to be vulnerable with anyone else so that 's the strongest feeling for me . 
  for others , they may feel powerful and sexy because that 's what their partner gives them . 
  neither is better or worse , it 's just each person feels it differently . 
  like a blowjob for your heart ? 
  while i 'm also a die-hard atheist i really think you should n't be misusing the term schizophrenic like that . 
  it 's a very severe mental disorder and there are enough misconceptions about mental disorders already . 
  none . 
  dead people are bad conversationalists and generally smell bad . 
  please do n't commit suicide if that 's what you 're considering . 
  ( psych student who has studied this but do n't have my texts on me right now ), 
  i do n't know a holistic term but there are a collection of self-serving biases and heuristics that keep up our own image of being the ` good guy ' ( actor-observer bias , hindsight bias , confirmation bias and others ) . 
  not sure if this is what you meant by studying them in respect to depression but one of the hallmarks of depression that the self-serving biases are n't used ( or used to the same extent anymore ) . 
  for example , we commonly misremember our memories to be better than they were . 
  it is very common for depression sufferers to not do this and actually remember as worse than they were . 
  ** edit ** : [ cool list of cognitive biases ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases ), 
  he 's battery operated . 
  r/askscience will get you a better answer, 
  learn to communicate . 
  create ground rules for fighting . 
  always make sure the other person knows that you love them , no matter how angry you are . 
  find different activities to do together . 
  remember that different people look at the same situation in different ways . 
  you would n't always find a way to meet in the middle but the important thing is understanding , not conforming . 
  do the little things to make them always feel loved . 
  try to make sure they know how you feel . 
  do n't be scared to be vulnerable . 
  it seems like you 're lying, 
  chilli increases your metabolism and releases endorphins . 
  there may be more benefits but they 're the only 2 i know of . 
  listening to the terrible t.v show my so is watching while i reddit, 
  i just swear because i 'm not 13, 
  starfox 64 was one of the all-time greats imo, 
  what an odd question, 
  it 's not about an urge to talk about your day , it 's an urge for socialisation . 
  i assumed that he wanted them * taken care of *, 
  suddenly , midgets . 
  confidence and arrogance are two different things and many people who appear or feel arrogant are actually not very confident at all ( like yourself ) , and it 's a way of compensating for their confidence . 
  try to find things that make you feel good about yourself that are n't reliant on being better than other people ( aim for satisfaction , not being the best ) . 
  it also may be valuable to look at why you 're not confident ; do you think that you can only be confident if you 're the best ? 
  do you feel that you have any fatal flaws ? 
  note : these are all issues that a good therapist can be valuable in helping you deal with . 
  socialising is idiotic ? 
  it actually does . 
  social bonding is incredibly important psychologically and strong correlates with good physical health . 
  yes but not every conversation can be a sharing of deep secrets . 
  part of it is getting to know each other - learning about their lives ( most of which is mundane ) . 
  when was the last time you met someone and the first thing they talked about was their deepest darkest secret ? 
  sorry , i forgot we agreed at the meeting, 
  he 's an asshole for making me feel bad about myself by being a far better person . 
  actually i 've heard his son interviewed . 
  he said that he did n't realise how rich they were until he was about 18 and that his dad was incredibly supportive . 
  i either support the poster 's genuine cause or his ruthlessness in using a mental disorder to get to the front page . 
  either way , well played sir . 
  i know you said certain emotions notwithstanding but it 's worth noting that several mental illnesses have correlations with physical illness because it leads to decreased activity ( which has a feedback effect ) . 
  do n't have my textbook with me but i do remember reading that general emotional well-being does seem to correlate with better long-term physical health , especially , as others have mentioned , because excessive cortisol is bad for your health . 
  if today is your first day and you 're already lacking motivation are you sure you 're in the right area ? 
  mahmood imadinnerjacket, 
  it only is in some parts of america . 
  the rest of the world found it fucking hilarious when people called them freedom fries, 
  because he gives 99 % of his earnings to charity, 
  right now , 5 years ahead in my studies and having more money . 
  would n't change anything else . 
  braveheart and rocky, 
  cats , memes , liberals and reposts, 
  i always smile at people . 
  i use nice manners and take opportunities to compliment people . 
  most importantly , i ask lots of questions .

  i 'm about 0.3 rumba instructors right now,
