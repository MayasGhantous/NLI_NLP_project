  i didnt mean it sarcastically m8, 
  its a story . 
  a story you told your self better than you had lived it . 
  pray to the seven , child . 
  that your burdensome love may be released . 
  i 'm curious . 
  do you have a source for that number ? 
  yeah i like the show better after reading this . 
  i ship this, 
  an apply a day ... 
  god dammit you gave me a flashback to the eragon movie . 
  anything but a feature length block buster * shudder *, 
  i felt this a bit too . 
  ever since they ran out of books theyve been murking bitches for nothing . 
  this season weve had dorne stabbing , iron islands stabbing , roose bolton stabbing , osha stabbing . 
  she 's gon na bring him back . 
  how could you possible take that as an insult ? 
  lighten up m8 . 
  why do they have to be old now ? 
  there not children of the forest anymore : / #petpeeves, 
  whats her name natalie dormer yeah shes giving off the vibes but not the character . 
  the non book readers , such as myself , dont have any expectations i guess it must be hard to see the story get warped and cut so badly . 
  by ai speech do you mean catch phrases or text to speech ? 
  you should n't have to feel obliged to play a game just because its a cool concept . 
  i can only imagine how a space engineers full release would have felt but i was personally unaffected by bugs . 
  i 'm all played out and that 's normal i think to move on . 
  keenswh thank you so much for giving me what i always wanted . 
  i thought realistic sound was going to have to be a mod !, 
  it is n't scriptable in the pb, 
  you need to convert wavs and make a workshop mod in order to play them through a sound block . 
  here 's the tutorial . 
  good luck !, 
  i have a mod for that coming out sometime soon tm . 
  watch this space, 
  haha thank clang for jetpacks, 
  soon \u2122 is a product of hasbro terms and conditions apply, 
  thanks for this . 
  i was on sansa 's page ( not sure why littlefinger did it ) but now it makes total sense . 
  the lannisters will not ride in defence of the boltons . 
  unless bloodraven knew he had to maintain the timeline . 
  but who got inside aery 's head and told him to burn them all ? 
  the strongest of plot armor : time itself . 
  oh right ty, 
  make it stop, 
  got would live forever in infamy if it ended with a giant fuck you to the fans like that . 
  theyve fucked with us so many times why stop now ? 
  the riot would be global . 
  run very far away before its too late . 
  i believe he is only capable of past travel because the weerwood roots have grown all through westeros and obtained a memory spanning a number of mellenia . 
  got is a massive franchise now . 
  maybe its possible they go even further beyond and milk it faiw ? 
  give em a hazardous work site injury . 
  neanderthals were dwarves woah, 
  but surely they are not immune to explosions ? 
  bruh they created the horde which makes them more evil than the lannisters . 
  with great magic comes great memory dulling alchoholism . 
  because we like more story not less : ^ ], 
  youngest man ive ever seen !, 
  its probably all coral now aka how i learned to love global warming , 
  no please god no hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngg, 
  pun intended, 
  your use of properties , sir , is fantastic . 
  might i recommend you stay consistent in this pattern and make all of your fields accessible only through properties ? 
  for example :, 
  public list < animal  animallist = ui.readfromxmlfile < list < animal   ( @ '' \\ \\ vmware-host \\ shared folders \\ biurko \\ animalsheltermenager \\ animalsheltermenager \\ data.xml '' ) ;, 
  becomes :, 
  private list < animal  animallist = ui.readfromxmlfile < list < animal   ( @ '' \\ \\ vmware-host \\ shared folders \\ biurko \\ animalsheltermenager \\ animalsheltermenager \\ data.xml '' ) ;, 
  return animallist ;, 
  nz here . 
  i never got porridge though my mum loves it . 
  every time i try it i want to throw up wtf ? 
  why are you being brigaded ? 
  plus most servers need to wipe every so often which makes any progression and sense of achievement hollow . 
  me too id love to see this !, 
  are you writing this in a suite or just notepad or something ? 
  anyways good luck with your project mate im looking forward to your release just dont hurt yourself by not using an ide . 
  i learned this the hard way :d, 
  mate antenna detection block would add a lot of cool stuff . 
  you could send a binary command based on if the antenna is on or off , broadcast 1 to many instead of the 1 to 1 we have with laser antennas , vanilla drone formations , etc etc. 
  also i want to build small blocks on large grids . 
  this could approximate compound blocks , 
  its worth going through all the obvious steps again even if you 're 100 % ; you just never know if you had split second lapse in concentration or something . 
  go into the in game script editor and load up the workshop script . 
  copy it into your suite of choice so that you can compare it with your source . 
  compare them by using https://www.diffchecker.com/ and if they match 100 % then id say there 's a high chance your users are making mistakes of their own . 
  in game scripts dont automatically update ; people need to double click the ingame scripts menu to load it again . 
  another note is if your ide does not convert tabs into spaces , your script will have no indentation ingame . 
  the only trouble ive had with the workshop is with uploading a mod . 
  i would get an error while uploading saying something along the lines of ` failed to upload ' . 
  it turns out , when steam is having a bad day , it sometimes decides to prevent the update if nothing has changed in your mod directory . 
  thanks to the modding community , they told me to try changing the format of the thumbnail from jpg to png every time i update ; this fixes the rare problem . 
  thats pretty unrelated but i hope i helped you get this sorted !, 
  my advice : if you want to finish your project then nows the time to learn programming . 
  if you want something done then do it yourself . 
  name the blocks in a simple pattern ( for example : `` leftshoulder p1 '' as piston naming pattern , `` rightshoulder r1 '' as rotor names ) and then put these components into lists . 
  heres my attempt at psuedo code . 
  its been a while since i did the ingame script shindig so there 's gon na be a few mistakes here :, 
  list < imypiston  leftshoulderpistons = new list < imypiston  ( ) ;, 
  list < imypiston  allpistons = gridterminalsystem.getblocksoftype ( < imypiston  ) as imypiston ;, 
  for ( int i = 0 ; i < allpistons.count ; i + + ),
