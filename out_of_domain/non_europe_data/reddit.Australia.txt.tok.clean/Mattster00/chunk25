  final fantasy . 
  it 's explained that he got his climbing skills from working on the rigging of both navy and pirate ships . 
  not the best explanation but still . 
  * spoiler *, 
  in the end of the novel adaptation and the start of 3 's novel adaptation , edward starts assassin business back in england , and was planning on training haytham , which implied that he was training others too . 
  maybe the people who think hitler did nothing wrong were actually referring to hitler 32-z . 
  he 's taking the water for a 2nd flood , probably because of the gays . 
  i think there 's a chrome extension that does it for you , but you have to custom input the words yourself . 
  i do n't think on mobile . 
  you know , i heard of a country called afghanistan that shares this * exact * same view on marriage . 
  maybe you should check it out . 
  virtual console probably boosts those numbers significantly , if they were counted in this . 
  i 'm just salty that ds and gba games got released on wii u vc instead of 3ds where they belong . 
  i 'm pretty sure either crabbe or goyle became black in deathly hallows part 2 . 
  no , because he is a straight cis white male , he can only be the messiah of the allies . 
  working on ii , iii and xiii . 
  if you do n't like sprites then play the ds/smartphone remakes of iii and iv . 
  they did n't remove the casinos in oras as a holdover from when some kids sued nintendo for alleging that they turned them into gambling addicts , and they were removed from newer games and remakes . 
  out of eso and xiv , xiv is by far the better game , but it has a subscription fee , whereas eso gave up on that and now only has the initial purchase fee . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20001022030204/http://www.nypost.com/news/14579.htm ) a link i found . 
  i do n't think they actually won , but nintendo just decided to remove them anyway . 
  my bad , i was thinking of the wrong problem . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/02/pokemon_lose_the_slots_from_their_heart_and_soul ) is the actual event , and it was actually to comply with european union law . 
  either way , still no game corner :(, 
  til that only american soldiers die in war . 
  probably a tie between buster sword , masamune ( ffi version ) and vajras from ffxiv, 
  i 'm pretty sure cid ( if you mean the vii one ) was given that name as a reference to kain . 
  kain himself got the last name from ricard highwind from ii , and some think he 's implied to be kains father , but iirc that theory was disproved . 
  can confirm , am now in space . 
  xenoblade chronicles was [ incredible ] ( https://youtu.be/v4vcehpv6hg ), 
  bravely default ( if that does n't count as its own thing ) , theatrhythm curtain call and dissidia . 
  one who gets in the way , engage the enemy , mechanical rhythm ... 
  i do n't think there 's a single bad song in the entire game . 
  i hope xenoblade x can live up to it though . 
  dae le bubonic plague better than le ebol ( g ) a ( y ) !, 
  why ca n't my generation appreciate such lethal killers ? 
  a dog . 
  one of my favourites is [ primal judgment ] ( https://youtu.be/nmll98a0v8k ) from ffxiv . 
  if you have the money for the subscription fee and time ( the game requires serious hours put into it for it to be worth it ) , go for it1, 
  the nascar wall does n't stretch across an entire border though . 
  judging by some grandmas , obama is big gay . 
  most people advocating for changing the laws of america do n't care about the laws of god . 
   our christian fight for liberty, 
  the liberty to own slaves . 
  if god wants his rainbow back he 's welcome to take it . 
  it must be that hacker 4chan again . 
  the death star was an inside job . 
  this is basically the plot for harry potter and the methods of rationality , except in that harry uses magic and science together . 
  tam tara deepcroft hm from xiv . 
  deepcroft hm had such a good atmosphere and sidestory . 
  i felt bad for edda ... at least until she tried to kill me . 
  pc version - superior resolution , custom controller support, 
  3ds - portability , 3d ( it looks really nice in 3d and does n't make your eyes very sore ) , touch screen item switching, 
  * cough * iran-contra * cough *, 
  i think the one you 're talking about is [ laveyan satanism ] ( https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccgqfjabahukewjz5uamvidhahuh2kykhfvpdcq&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2flaveyan_satanism&amp;ei=pti4vdnpbqgwmwx7n7egda&amp;usg=afqjcneqs-bjw5blzkj1jwcxo6br3pmrpg&amp;sig2=ehrty8xbfcl9uc2gezjkga&amp;bvm=bv.98717601,d.dgy ) , a group that is basically atheists ( hence the not believing in satanism ) , who see satan as a positive role model due to their perception of his beliefs in freethinking , non-conformism etc. 
  [ through the gloom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brwk610u9cw ) from xiv . 
  after i saw this , i asked my cousins dog if he wants to industrially kill humans for food . 
  he barked a couple of times and then walked away , so there 's that . 
  / u/user _ history_bot @mattster00, 
  i do n't think so , as they were optional side content in 2.0 and have n't been changed , but they are required for coil . 
  in hyrule warriors you can get rupees in the tens of thousands per mission without upgrades , so there 's that . 
  is this aware that 99.9 % of all species to ever live are extinct , and the majority of those were n't caused by humans ? 
   killed over 150 people, 
  well there 's your answer . 
  speaking of final solutions ... 
   this is the reality of the relationship between nyc police and ethnic minorities . 
  they see all of us as immediately suspicious . 
  you 're the ones seeing them as suspicious though ... 
  well maybe we would accept them if planned parenthood stopped murdering babies !!!! 1 !!!! 1 !! 111 !, 
  benghazi !!!!!, 
  if isaac newton can be wrong about matter affecting gravity , then chomsky can be wrong about schools creating brainwashed sheeple .

  final fantasy vii remake . 
  i 'm protecting mine with an illegal immigrant . 
  if bernie sanders is elected with neil smoke degrasse tyson as his vp i will gild everyone of your posts . 
  iirc abortion is illegal after about 26 weeks ( except if the mother would die from the birth ) since after that point the foetus can feel pain . 
  i am aunt petunia-kin and that triggers me . 
  the muslim must have had a monster dong to do that . 
  ( iirc ) to the crusaders , they were n't stealing , they were recovering stolen property ( the holy land ) from the muslims . 
  of course , most of the crusaders gave up on that and pillaged like shit , but that was the official stance . 
  defeated ramuh ex in df with 3 dps after three tries ( first try we had 4 dps ) .

  i thought it came from the fact that many freed slaves after the civil war were still poor , and watermelons were cheap and easy to farm . 
  i am the guy from terraria in wall-e , so that would work out . 
  maybe i 'm just reading this wrong , but i 'm pretty sure the last line has 6 syllables ( ra-il on the met-ro ) .
