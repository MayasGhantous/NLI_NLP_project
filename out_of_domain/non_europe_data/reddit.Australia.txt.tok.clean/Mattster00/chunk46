  they 're bringing chitauri . 
  they 're murderers . 
  and some , i assume , are good rulers . '', 
  sometimes i feel like sanders ' plan is to slowly draw everyone in by acting all peaceful and social democrat-y , and then one day just seize the means of production overnight, 
  that should really be ` hiring top level business executives to positions in the government so they can meddle for free ', 
  sometimes a bash is too good for a fash, 
  well i 'm not burning * their * flag, 
  what if sophia is the cloud of darkness looking to destroy all existence by causing an endless chain of balance and rebalance all the way until zodiark kills hydaelyn and then kills himself, 
  if anything comparing a wii game to a ps3 game is more unfair, 
  it 's possible the lagos event could have gone different with qs there ( eg he could have ran crossbones out of the city before he could explode ) , so wanda never would have lost public image in the first place, 
   the end result of this is alienating the moderates, 
  if insults were enough to sway moderates trump would have only gotten like 25 % of the vote, 
  he 's joking that since they 're mexican , they 're illegal immigrants and thus do n't have proper immigration papers , instead of rolling papers for weed, 
  the dsi was n't , and dsi enhanced games like pokemon bw2 were locked, 
  i believe the 2010 model did n't have a dedicated mobile gpu , but i ca n't look it up to confirm, 
  we did it reddit !, 
  i do n't think asgardite is a thing in the mcu, 
  still more draconic than a palm tree, 
  no need to lobby when you put the billionaire executives in government positions instead, 
  i just hope final fantasy 7r makes it on, 
  gulags are highly intelligent though, 
  prediction for infinity war : the first shot will be thanos getting his phd and md at the same time , to drive the connection home, 
  in sephirot ex i was the last one alive with the boss on the verge of death , i tried shukuchi-ing to negate the knockback from fists of mercy and ended up right under a fist instead, 
  bee too thanks, 
  it 's only human nature that he 'd betray people for money , i mean , it happens in the wild !, 
  unless noah and his family was descended from cain then they would have died by default, 
  to be fair , he was literally murdered, 
  tentacles/rotten '20, 
  perfect for children with no necks !, 
  star of the nickelodeon classic drake and jon, 
  how many of 'em ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with changing your name to the superior candidate, 
  i mean ( assuming you believe both the literal bible and the cain people = black theory ) if that were the case the entire world would be black , since all the people descended from noah 's family , or at least the bible/book of mormon would have to explain that, 
   cute girl answering my questions honestly while lap pillowing, 
  r/absolutelynotanime _ irl, 
  do n't let your dreams be dreams, 
  i think there are isis based twitter accounts for recruitment , but they 're kept up so that intelligence services can use it to track them down ( one time a terrorist posted a selfie that led to his location getting drone striked or something ), 
  tony ` stop the boats ' abbott is nowhere near trumps level , however, 
  i do n't think the alt right knows what the alt right means, 
  that ` spoonful of sugar ' was probably paid for by welfare, 
  i should let you know hillary lost the election so you ca n't keep using her to keep deflecting criticism of trump anymore, 
  i think there 'll be a * lot * of randoms playing botw at 4 am on launch day, 
  yeah , it was so if the ds flopped it wouldnt damage the game boy name, 
  yeah , the black panthers do n't wear ridiculous costumes, 
  well yeah but those were socialist countries so it 's all ok, 
  because they 're inherently not going to be fairly treated when you have managers , executives and ceo 's preventing them from receiving the full value of what they produce, 
  for an example , in 2014 the ceo of discovery communications ( david zaslav ) made $ 156.1 million , which is almost 1951 times the average yearly wage of someone at his company ( ~ $ 80000 ) . 
  considering how it would be physically impossible to do 1951 x more work than someone in a year , that means he 's taking money from other workers who are n't being fairly compensated . 
  and while he may be an outlier , the average is still 204x pay for ceo 's compared to average worker , which still does n't leave much room . 
  you 're right in saying that higher level employees do work , it 's just that they do n't usually do enough to justify how much they make ( managers usually do , i did n't think that hard when i wrote it ), 
  [ source ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/research/ceo-pay-ratio/ ), 
  you 're not going to be finding many liberals supporting castro, 
  mobile games are free to play , pay to play is ( i think ) subscription based games like some mmo 's, 
  that 's not really an accomplishment, 
   everything that exists in the universe exists because of an equal-and-opposite force/idea . 
  the very possibility of winning a democratic election shows that opposite ideologies are n't equal, 
   everyone 's taught to think by ` demonising ' things . 
  it could be anything from an outcome in life , people group , or behaviour . 
  there 's no way around that because it 's how society is still alive . 
  society owes more to being able to accept rather than to demonise . 
   the left 's rhetoric is centred around misleading certain people ( sjws ) that everyone should think and feel how they do, 
  literally every major political , religious and social group wants more people to think and act like they do . 
  you ca n't exactly win elections if you 're unconcerned with whether or not people think like you enough to vote for you, 
   if they do n't then they 're a bigot and should be demonised ... does n't this sound like tyranny , not free speech ? 
  free speech only protects your freedom of speech from direct government censorship , individuals are free to criticise and insult whoever they want, 
   when they used rich celebrities like katy perry , jayz , and beyonce to appeal to a generation who 've practically been bred to follow whatever feeds their attention alone , and i personally find that move disgusting . 
  considering the right wing literally elected a rich celebrity to the presidency , they ca n't really talk about celebrity influence in politics, 
   you 'll see that same trend in the media , which majorly fucked up this election . 
  yeah , breitbart and infowars were pretty shitty, 
   the divides we see in america right now are actually a product of the left 's rhetoric , which is closer to breeding tyranny than any other instance in america 's political history . 
  there was that one time america had slaves, 
   a political system of at least two equal-and-opposite parties is essential to the health of a democracy . 
  if the two parties are equal nothing would ever get done . 
  actually making change ( whether to the right or left ) requires that one of the parties ( in a party based system ) necessarily has to be unequal, 
   they meant illegal immigrants who are practically feeding off the system that the rest of americans ( including other registered minorities spend their life working for, 
  illegal immigrants ca n't claim welfare . 
  additionally , the jobs illegal immigrants work are shitty enough that no one else wants them , for pay far below minimum wage , since they ca n't exactly report it to the police, 
   they also get to vote in a system that they do n't have to contribute towards . 
  illegal immigrants ca n't vote , still pay taxes such as sales tax , and provide services via working jobs no one else wants, 
   the black panthers supported obama , so by your definition of a racist leader we 've been under a racist regime for 8 years . 
  remind me when the black panthers committed mass nationwide lynchings and got away with it ? 
  that was fake frank who married max, 
  it 's george soros apparently, 
  mike ` turning fruits into vegetables ' pence ? 
  it 's about the subversion of expectations, 
  a game theory, 
  this is only from the 2013 reboot , not the original one, 
  when reagan said ` fuck the berlin wall ' , that 's not what he meant, 
  now look at this net, 
  you can use the global trade system to trade online with other players , so you can breed the unevolved version of your exclusives and trade them for the ones you need, 
  which is why he 'll work on a prequel, 
  possibly / s, 
  clash on the big bridge , fight with seymour , force your way, 
  an iphone can play game boy games better than the game boy could, 
  overall it would be v to me , although i though vi had the better story, 
  i took the even even easier route and visited the planet in person, 
  they probably just did n't think to add it , given it was the first version, 
  i remember how shitty team based games were before priests were added, 
  personally i relate to the suit of armour in the background, 
  there 's actually both .
