  and we have killed him, 
  boku no pico, 
  ` south -- america ! ', 
  it might be the after credits scene for guardians 2 ( since thanos/the stones were confirmed not part of the story ) . 
  could be that it has the nova corps in panic mode as an unidentified threat shows up , cuts to thanos standing at the bridge of his ship or whatever with the gauntlet on his hand, 
  that might be good , and it gives a reason for thor to come to earth to protect the mind stone , realising that it 's next on the list, 
  stunfisk wants to have a word with you, 
  ` become ' implies i was once not good-for-nothing, 
  i 've transcended worrying about life and death to just not caring about anything in general, 
  even if you only consider monotheistic religion , i think zoroastrianism was first , so idk what he thinks that could mean, 
  but when soviet russia banned christianity it was proof of the ebil socialism, 
  he once held an american flag , checkmate libtards, 
  if he was serious , he would n't have both more and less regulation together , just one, 
  except catholic, 
  ask why they did n't call it life 2, 
  g o l f i n g, 
  it 's only a matter of time until bernie advocates seizing the means of production, 
  based on the subtitle ( historical ties between homophobia in communities of colour and colonisation ) , the title is probably just meant to be attention grabbing and shocking , which it certainly is given the cheeto disciple breakdown, 
  if there is even a 1 % chance of zack snyder directing another batman movie we need to take it as an absolute certainty, 
  i do n't think loki will 100 % save the day/provide the means to save the day , but i think that he might decide to become good and fight thanos on his own , dying in the process , thus still giving him redemption and giving thor a personal reason to fight thanos, 
  since it 's mentioned that apparition between continents is incredibly difficult , travel to the moon would be borderline impossible , if not just flat out impossible, 
  not necessarily . 
  i ca n't remember where i saw this , but apparently rich white and black people face roughly the same amount of discrimination ( that is , not much ) while poor black people face eons more discrimination than poor white people , likely because it fuels the stereotype of lazy black people . 
  there are exceptions ( e.g colin kaepernick ) but for the most part poor black face far more discrimination, 
  i think you mean ( ( ( financially elite ) ) ), 
  apple did nothing wrong , bananas deserved worse, 
  by most definitions god would n't count as alive anyway, 
   maybe, 
  i do n't think there 's any 3 billion year old bacteria alive today, 
  uh , yes , are you going to finish that holocaust ? 
  i ca n't tell whether normanisbeyonce is faking it or genuinely believes, 
  featuring dante from the devil may cry series, 
  final fantasy 7 remake, 
  the freedom to work 40 hour work weeks for minimal pay until you die under a boss who makes thousands of times more money than you is * definitely * one worth protecting, 
  social programs are only inefficient because the republicans vote to slaughter their funding , hold them up as a standard of why big government is bad , and then use them as examples to vote down even more programs, 
  the poor , poor , millionaires . 
  i 'm sure the 25 million people who die every year from starvation related causes are just * clamouring * for more tax cuts, 
  because they vote out every government method designed to help them since taxes should n't support welfare queens ? 
  when the millions of people who die every year from starvation stop , you can claim charity is more effective than taxation, 
  i mean , it 's in that area where objectively you know it 's fake , but deep down in the lowest depths of your mind you 're thinking ` what if it 's not ', 
  they 'd probably rather leave it ambiguous so that if undeniable proof is found they can say ` see !, 
  we did n't * really * lie ! ', 
  while trump may be their preferred candidate , it 's still them over him, 
  yeah sure, 
  is it thelionheart27 ? 
  yeah , because it 's not the parents that are at fault here, 
   human, 
  does not compute, 
  right wingers : we need guns and the 2nd amendment to protect from government tyranny !, 
  black people : ok then how about when thousands of people are murdered by the police yearly ? 
  we could use some protection from that . 
  right wingers : nah that 's just the boys in blue doing their job , we mean like when people who burn down government farmland get arrested, 
  so glad i grew up as a movie character, 
  is 3 from xenoblade chronicles/x ? 
  is it a theme heard during a battle ? 
  here 's list of all the xeno songs in smash ( since the url has a bracket in it hyperlinking text does n't work ), 
  http://www.ssbwiki.com/list_of_ssb4_music_ ( xenoblade_series ), 
  additionally , is it [ tragic decision ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umfc69vlaf4 ) ? 
  looks like the only thing that 's a ` criple ' here is your spelling, 
   kaepernick is at it again !, 
   what did he say this time ? 
   ` some police officers are n't nice people and america is n't a perfect nation ', 
  for a communist sleeper agent , obama sure has n't seized many means of production yet, 
  what about foreign steak makers ? 
  do they deserve to die because they were n't born in the right country ? 
  and yet 99 % of that * highly diverse * population speaks the same language , wears the same clothes and likes the same things, 
  to be fair , one time we saw him standing up from his chair, 
   i 'm american, 
  certainly could n't have figured that out from your posts anyway, 
  well he certainly ca n't use his own, 
   can you blame me, 
  yeah kinda, 
  score one for christianity then, 
  fully automated luxury * gay * space communism had to start somewhere, 
  yeah , because a false flag * islamic * terror attack is surely going to make american * christians * look bar, 
  seize the means of egg laying, 
  no surprise that the more right wing the country , the worse their media is, 
  ` at least i have corn ' - neeroy krushchev, 
  but then you have the problem of every other nation on earth declaring war on you , which would be far more catastrophic than a few terror attacks, 
  black , bitter , preferably fair trade, 
  if he becomes the final boss of ffv he 'll have to charge up his kanye almagest, 
   after zero layers in, 
  ftfy, 
  in order , probably 8 , 6 , 7 , 14 , 10, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_casualties_in_the_war_in_afghanistan_ ( 2001 -- 2014 ), 
  my favourite one was on some music video where the first one was ' i really like this song , it 's one of my favourite pieces ' , and 42 comments later we get ` and in conclusion , that is why world war 2 was inevitable even without hitler in power ', 
  just a patriot defending his homeland from the judeo-bolshevik hordes, 
  the jews are everywhere, 
  that entire thread is a goldmine for nocontext posts, 
  ` be honest . 
  do you really think it matters ', 
  actually scratch that , i do n't want to know, 
  ` evil empire ' ? 
  sounds like something a traitor who still lives in the 50 's would say !, 
  i mean , in ( canon ) goblet of fire ron brags that he has a broom that can reach jupiter , so the concept of space travel is at least known to them , even if so far it has failed, 
  dudley was born before harry ( i think by a year ) so his 11th birthday would have come first , thus the letter would n't be familiar to them, 
  and remember what * great * event happened 7 years after that date ? 
  more like atlas shrugged, 
  is that meant to be a really wispy trump hair , or is it just me, 
  silly rebels , they should have just signed a change.holonet petition to disarm the death star instead,
