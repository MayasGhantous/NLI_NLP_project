  the, 
  the secret to interstellar flight is to set up a portkey to a spaceship , and when it reaches its destination an astronaut could just pick up the portkey and save decades of time, 
  well i thought that was implied, 
  so i told the mandarin to come attack me at my house ... he actually did it the absolute madman hahaha !, 
  well , someone with the username deathtocommunism is an unbiased source of information, 
  all those deposed south american governments would have something to say about american ` justice ', 
  plus shiva and garuda, 
  my theory for the omega raid title ( bend of time ) is that you fight various forms of omega at the end of each raid chapter , he uses the interdimensional rift to escape to the future each time , and the final chapter has you venture into the rift to stop him for good . 
  you forget , they do n't hate jews , they hate ( ( ( financial elites ) ) ), 
  omega , the recurring superboss ( first appeared in ff5 ) , and the star of the new 8 man raid series, 
   your mum, 
  hey , it says 90 kilograms , not 90 megatons, 
  my theory is that thelegend27 had his arms replaced with trebuchets , which is why he 's the best game of war player ever, 
  but can a trebuchet launch darth sideous 50 cm into a death star pit ? 
  yes, 
  means of production, 
  ` it 's just a prank bro ' - trump, 
  uh , well technically , ah , nah, 
  did you just use a low quality outdated joke, 
  well here 's one american browser, 
  when you consider not murdering minorities in the street a racial achievement the bar is set quite low, 
  the bc/ad dating system did n't exist during jesus time , so when it was developed it was made around jesus ' assumed birth year , rather than the other way around, 
  just like god is known for causing torrential weather every single time someone deconverts, 
  the best part is in the 3rd book where the mc goes to the past to stop butt dinosaurs from bringing about armageddon, 
  yeah , you have to pay for prostitution, 
  [ it 's all too real ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bumageddon:_the_final_pongflict ), 
  tbh i actually kinda liked the series when i was younger , but it 's far from a literary masterpiece, 
  i think there 's a vague reference to the ` morning star ' as being similar/the same as satan , which then became lucifer ( light bringer ) . 
  idk this is all probably wrong, 
  ayn rand , is that you ? 
  the upgraded leviathan weapons would be similar, 
  the only thing vader did wrong was killing the emperor, 
  nintendo is what genesis n't, 
  people who decided the republican party was n't right wing enough, 
  considering this is the 50 's , probably being kicked off buses, 
  they 're probably entitled millennial shitlibs / s, 
  oh , you like vikings ? 
  name five of their conquests, 
  modern day china is in no way socialist, 
  i agree , sand is coarse , rough , irritating , and to top it all off , it gets everywhere, 
  they 're also not communist, 
  `` communism is when the government does stuff , and the more stuff it does the more communist-er it is '' - you , apparently, 
  that was deimos iirc, 
  i think the ewoks in 6 were specifically derived from vietnam , but not the series as a whole, 
  on the one hand , being against corruption does n't necessarily make you good , albeit possibly better . 
  in universe , many of the original separatists had legitimate concerns about incredibly high taxation , crushing tariffs , oppressive laws from the republic that ignored local needs , etc , but was co-opted from behind by palpatine into basically becoming an ayncrap ` lol we do n't want taxes ' society, 
  on the other hand , double the hands equals double the toothbrush seizing , so i think we give this one to grievous, 
  25 dimensional backgammon, 
  in vii , leia remarks ( about kylo ) that he ` has more of vader in him ' ( or something like that ) , implying her image of vader is as something evil/dark . 
  of course , it 's possible that meeting the reformed anakin could have changed her mind , but this is just based off what is confirmed, 
  the battle raps in these instances act as substitutes for war , where the loser , as decided by votes from a neutral ` third dimension ' , has to surrender a designated tribute . 
  the challenging party makes the claim of what they want e.g hitler from the naziverse might claim a district in coruscant from the star wars-verse , they then fight , and either, 
  a. hitler then claims his new coruscatian land , or, 
  b. vader claims something of equal value from the naziverse e.g the city of munich, 
  in this way , vast scale interdimensional wars that could see billions of deaths are avoided , restricting war to local conflict within dimensions, 
  iirc hermione says right after ` how are they getting the potions in , filch blocks weasley bought things ' , to which hermione replies ` they disguise them as cough potions ' , so it * was * likely a weasley potions , and the school does n't seem to have any special rules against love potions, 
   avatar : the last airbender/korra, 
   anime, 
  normies get out get out, 
  i can confirm that it is indeed not korea, 
  for the finale , replace ozai with trump , the earth kingdom with the middle east and sozin 's comet with nukes, 
  tell that to kanjiklub !, 
  whale hello there, 
  xenoblade chronicles, 
  obviously the plan to introduce sharia law and nationwide gun control , duh, 
  are you implying that skin colour is the only factor of diversity ? 
  he 's using simon 's machine from the episode ` betty ' to view his mother in the past . 
  the line ` come mom , grab your friends ' is warning her to stick together in a group with others , as she was killed on her own, 
  ( the line is actually ` come on , grab your friends ' ), 
  iirc it was specifically written in black speech , a language made by sauron for the whole of mordor, 
  for padme , one theory i saw was that palpatine was using the force to drain her life force to fuel anakin ( darth plagueis 's ` secrets of life ' ) , or that anakin was doing it unconsciously himself . 
  since most medical machines are n't built to detect the force , they could n't tell what was really killing her . 
  with obi wan , he knew that if there was even a chance of his survival luke would stay to rescue him , possibly leading to luke 's discovery as a force sensitive at the hands of vader , so he sacrificed himself to force luke to flee, 
  and here i thought we 'd be safe from death stars, 
  if you support trump you 're already losing at life, 
  ca n't be that shitty a country if they did n't elect donald trump, 
  baby , i might not believe in christ , but i can still give you a second coming, 
  the event technically never needed to be released , since it only requires an arceus , and not an azure flute one specifically , so it can be done with a global downloaded one, 
  i mean , i stole it as well , so i ca n't really claim ownership, 
  if it 's always on the other side of the sun from earth , would n't it just collide with the sun and burn up ? 
  because god is in on the conspiracy as well , and created the flat earth in order to hide the fact that he does n't know how to make spheres, 
  the events of the actual overwatch game are considered non-canon , and i do n't think mercy kills in any supplementary material , although i have n't read it all, 
  some of these guys even have faaaaaaaa ... . 
  * gary *, 
  but you can call me tiffany, 
  he guarantees krennic 's death and establishes the power of the ds against rebels, 
  if you could defeat far right viewpoints with political discussion the nazis never would have made it past stage one . 
  not all viewpoints are created equal , and to pretend they are is delusional, 
  a young , inexperienced surfer, 
  3 words or less ? 
  now what phrase does that remind me of ? 
  oh i know !, 
  bash, 
  alas poor secure connection , i knew he well, 
  should have had soviet russia and china arguing about how many kulaks were killed , then shifting to comrade pingu, 
  thanks b0ss, 
  and only the part that does n't mention a well regulated militia, 
  considering r/leftwithsharpedge got banned , it probably would n't work, 
  master goebbels , there 's too many of them . 
  what are we going to do ?
