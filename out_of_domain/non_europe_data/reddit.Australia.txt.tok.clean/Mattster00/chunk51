  * cocks pistol *, 
  correct me if i missed something , but was n't that just torture instead of killing ? 
  i s l a m i c h o r d e s, 
  because the word of a bunch of old white people 230 years ago is obviously superior to anything people from the modern day could think up, 
  i do n't know about anyone else but personally that 's my fetish, 
  i 'd honestly have to question the mental state of someone willing to violate the law on rape but * not * the one for bathroom entering, 
  a voice pack where terry crews just voices every single character would be great . 
  i remember seeing that comment in the wild , they grow up so fast, 
  common wealth ? 
  sounds pretty socialist to me, 
  all those hobbits can get pretty annoying,

  not enough supply lines and victors writing history, 
  donald trump : shit businessman , coming soon to the nintendo 3ds, 
  j o b s,

  seize the means of guacamole production, 
  automated, 
  we did it reddit !, 
  is mayonnaise an instrument ? 
  mountain climbing prank gone wrong gone sexual, 
  i guess that means china must be a pretty good country if trump hates them, 
  anyone who voted trump because left wingers said mean words to them online was never a staunch hillary/third party supporter to begin with, 
  except he literally called himself a modern day crusader, 
  well not if you want to be a psychopath you dont, 
  south america just loves the us military, 
  well the first time i saw anything about it , yeah , because it 's possible to feel negative emotion * without * collapsing into a catatonic heap on the ground , although someone who eats batteries should n't expect to be able to feel higher order thinking, 
  according to his wikipedia page he does n't believe in god/jesus yet still admired christianity and directly strove to protect the christian values of the west with his attack , so his attack is more christian than not, 
  even then they do n't advocate torture as a method of execution, 
   obama is a marxist, 
  do n't you all remember that time he tried overthrowing capitalism and establishing the ussa ? 
  this is the same world where a cult that wants to destroy the universe only warrants a single intelligence agent , so they do n't really make sense,

  l e t i t d i e, 
  yeah , it 's pretty terrifying to spot an australian in the water, 
  add ` double mudras ' ( ninjitsu 's that use the same mudra twice ) so nin can get more actions without having to sacrifice button space, 
  if the deaths of four military personnel is enough to destabilise relationships no country in history would have ever allied with each other, 
  it 's hilarious seeing how much americans think other countries care about benghazi, 
  well considering your first comment said you wished obama did n't ` make america appear weak to our allies ' , it seems you do care what they think of you, 
  why * are * different * words * randomly * coloured * ? 
  because ther not reel americans !!!!! 1 !!!, 
  funnily enough , in the master quest for oot they actually made the water temple * easier * where every other level was harder, 
  technically dsi enhanced games ( eg pok\u00e9mon black/white ) were region locked , but they were such a small number it did n't really matter, 
  plot twist : the ` you 're ' here actually refers to anime, 
  half of those planets do n't even have a solid surface for humans to live on, 
  the institution of marriage , duh, 
  you know , there 's more drug dealers in the bottom set than the top one , but apparently it ok if you do it to fight communists, 
   polite to women, 
  except al capone literally got his scars after he told a woman `` honey , you got a nice ass and i mean that as a compliment , believe me '' and her angry brother attacked him, 
  so you 're telling me a 1970 's tv show * is n't * well known by people born years after that decade ? 
  colour me surprised !, 
  funny how they were on their way to fight a nation as right wing as they get , but do n't dare bring that up unless you want a 20 page essay on why the nazi 's were really communists, 
  i do n't know , just ask putin 's states of america why nationalists never work together, 
  more like the serial killers of the world, 
  but ' 1000 ' people getting raped by refugees is cause for genocide,

  roses are red , kenobi is ben, 
  ' i am the senate ' ` it 's treason , then ? ', 
  brits out, 
  are you implying that amd was once not dank ?

  rip my statistics, 
  touch controls are generally godawful though, 
  technically pc has zero first parties , barring a few microsoft games, 
  first party means it was made by the manufacturer of the device , not just exclusive to the device , so something would need to be made by microsoft/apple or the manufacturer of the physical hardware e.g. 
  nvidia , amd , intel . 
  peer pressure, 
  unless russia strikes a deal with alien invaders , no country on earth will ever pose a threat to the us at a level that this military would be required for,

  1800 's : i got shot because some guy with a gun got offended, 
  1900 's : i got thrown in prison for striking because my boss was offended,

  there was that one with lisa and a simpsonised version of michelle obama where lisa decided to attack her for trying to make school lunches healthier while still eating bacon in private - the epitome of government evil,

  i 'm still preparing for the hacked dk bongo drums run, 
  according to the [ know your meme ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/fire-emblem-fates-localization-controversy ) page for fire emblem fates , several minor side stories ( some of the supports ) had their dialogue somewhat altered , as well as the removal of a minigame ( though you still gain the benefits for free instead ) , but none of the main story was altered in any way . 
  but they did capture him in the shack , it was only when lupin turned into a werewolf outside that he escaped , and ( like in the movie iirc ) snape would probably focus on protecting the trio over catching pettigrew . 
  i 'd say it 's that the sages reincarnate in the same way as link does , except into different species , considering that some of them go back to non-human in albw,
