  like the time a holocaust denial group [ offered $ 50,000 to anyone who could prove jews were gassed at auschwitz , and then refused to pay up when someone did ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com.au/amp/www.jta.org/1985/07/26/archive/holocaust-survivor-wins-50000-reward-offered-by-revisionist-group/amp ) where 's * your * proof the holocaust never happened ? 
   americans made deals with natives for their land who , mind you , were nomadic tribes that did not have towns or cities and moved around based on the season . 
  there was no ` conquering ' . 
  does the trail of tears ring a bell ? 
  deals made at the barrel of a gun are not valid deals . 
   besides , if you want to move goal posts to america , black americans contribute to over 50 % of violent crime in the us despite only being 13 % of the population, 
  you are literally making the same argument jon did , completely ignoring economic and social status, 
   `` muh british empire was mean '' again , natives made deals with the settlers for land . 
  there 's a reason the phrase ` indian giving ' exists . 
  actually , the phrase [ ` indian giver ' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_giver ) refers to someone who gives a gift and later expects something of similar value back . 
  dismissing millions of deaths and suffering as ` muh british empire ' is an incredibly shortsighted viewpoint , but on par for the course with white supremacists, 
   america and canada were established as white nations . 
  for america , it was written in the original naturalization act of 1790 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naturalization_act_of_1790 , and this was overturned with the immigration act of 1965 , which no us citizen voted for , had a say in , or was even aware it passed , which lead to the grand shift in american demographics . 
  and canada was a british colony who only accepted in those in the empire . 
  looks like we do n't have to go anywhere . 
  so when europe is established as muslim only in the first caliphate naturalisation act of 2046 , you 'll be fine with that ? 
  the native americans had no say in the naturalisation act of 1790 , why does that not render it invalid ? 
  there was a study done ( on mobile so ca n't link ) where two identical resumes were sent in to various companies , the only difference being that one had a ` white name ' and the other had a ` black name ' and guess what ? 
  the ` black name ' ones were 33 % less likely to be accepted . 
  black people receive more time for the same crime , are more likely to be picked up for petty crimes like drug use , face more police discrimination , so explain how all of that is expected to fade away in a span of only ~ 50 years, 
  ` laziness is a trait in blacks ' - the 45th president of the usa, 
  more like proof that hitler was utterly incompetent as a military leader . 
  and you still have n't proven that the holocaust never happened, 
   the indian removal act was in 1830 dude - not exactly 1776 , is it ? 
  so apparently not a single native american was forced off their land until 1830 ? 
   you think economic or social status excuses somebody committing a violent crime ? 
  please justify this to me . 
  apparently violence towards native americans is justified because they did n't have the right system of government , so why would n't that be the case ? 
  violent crime is a spectrum that spans all the way from stealing a load of bread at knifepoint to avoid starvation all the way to serial killing , and it 's impossible to condemn such a spectrum without considering all the possible situations, 
   and yes , the settlers made deals for the land , now natives think they 're entitled to it after their ancestors traded it for beads and booze . 
  even the indian removal act was to * negotiate * native resettlement , and signing removal treaties were voluntary . 
  pointing a gun at someone 's head and demanding they sign over their house is n't voluntary , and neither is the dominant military power of the land demanding a minority racial group leave their own land for meaningless trinkets, 
   edit : when it comes to islamic invasion , these are nations which are already established ; they are not unclaimed lands . 
  you are drawing a false equivelancy between anglo-european settlers creating a nation where there once was none , and islamic invaders trying to take over a previously-established nation , their native population , and system of government in favour of their own . 
  european governments are the only real system of governments , got it, 
   p.s. 
  i noticed how you 've completely failed to acknowledge how much crime non-germans create in germany . 
  i 'll consider that you conceding to my point . 
  a site that uses the term ` american negroes ' is hardly unbiased . 
  [ what about mass crime * against * refugees ] (, 
  https://www.google.com.au/amp/amp.dw.com/en/bka-2016-crime-rates-show-germany-continues-to-be-dangerous-for-refugees/a-37394946 ) , do you support mass deportation in those cases ? 
  put it this way - you 're standing there , minding your own business , when someone starts beating the crap out of you , continuing for several hours until you have multiple broken bones . 
  eventually , the police arrive and take the guy away from you , yet they do nothing to help you get back up . 
  with both arms and legs broken , you 're expected to make your way back home on your own , and to make matters worse you get people condescending about how one time they got poked in the eye and were still fine, 
  i was n't talking about chinese or jews , i was talking about white people who think being called a cracker once is equivalent to decades of institutional racism, 
  weird , because a group that was once legal to enslave is worse off than a group that was never legal to enslave, 
  what is it with your bullshit talking point that natives did n't inhabit their land ? 
  just because there were no skyscrapers does n't mean no one lived there, 
  [ men commit 90 % of murders despite being 49 % of the ( us ) population ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expandhomicidemain ) , where 's your outrage over that ? 
  so ` men have committed the super-majority of crime for all of human existence ' is a-ok , but ` black people commit a barely-majority of crime for ~ 60 years ' now warrants mass deportations and population limitation ? 
  also , china 's gender selective abortion rates ( as in , females were far more likely to be aborted than males ) ended up working quite well for causing a major male-female imbalance in newer generations , so there 's no evidence to suggest that the opposite could n't work . 
  a society that prioritised abortion of males would be far more sustainable than one prioritising female abortions , since one male can impregnate multiple females , whereas multiple males ca n't impregnate one females . 
  so , while a society ca n't exist without men , it can exist with dramatically reduced amounts of men . 
  of course , such a society where men were routinely aborted and expelled from the country for no good reason would be utterly despicable , but so would one where black people have the same done to them . 
  considering sjw apparently covers anything from clinton democrats to far left communists , it 's not ridiculous to use the opposite,

  karl marx : ayy capitalism is pretty bad, 
  you : socialism was made by the capitalist elite, 
   wall or gulag, 
  idk , i 've seen plenty of good battlefront and clone wars tv memes, 
  so how does that justify kicking them off their own land ? 
  why do your standards of land ownership deserve to be paramount over all others . 
  someone without the concept of land ownership can not in good faith sign away their land ownership . 
  if you asked a 12th century serf ` hey , i 'll trade you this barrel of ale for your ` agricultural production output area ' they 'd most likely accept , unaware that they just sold away their farm and livelihood . 
  likewise , when native americans ` traded ' away their land they likely assumed that the colonists wanted to * share * the land , rather than take control of it for themselves . 
  your ancestors sweat , bled and died to end toxic white nationalism , not support it . 
  if all it takes for the white race to die out is interracial marriage and legal immigration , it 's a wonder that it ever survived to this point in the first place . 
  i have more in common with a black straight cisgender male than a white lesbian transgender female , so why does the latter deserve my respect more ? 
  why ? 
  why is a white person on another continent who i have never met , never will meet , and share almost nothing in common with , more deserving of my respect than an asian who i see every day , share very similar viewpoints with and actually know , based solely on skin colour ? 
  to me , actions and beliefs are * far * more important than race , because how people act is a choice , whereas the colour of someone 's skin is not . 
  and men committing nearly 2x their population rate in murders * is n't * disproportionate ? 
  i do n't hate white people , i just do n't like them inherently more than non-white people . 
  some white people i like more than some non-white people , some white people i dislike more than some non-white people . 
  who i like is n't dictated by race , it 's by actions .

  haha yeah , because the rich elite * definitely * are n't in control now or anything, 
  you 'd expect a group of marxists to be * against * an organisation promoting free capitalist trade, 
  if being a communist was against the rules why do they have a flair, 
  i do n't think there 's an exact number out there , but in the scene klaue looks at his phone and we can see multiple payments in the billions and hundreds of millions , so it was probably something like 3 or 4 billion usd,

  killing six people in a mosque is probably up there, 
  well it 's a good thing you did n't ask for offensive * non-violent only * things then, 
  you said ` what 's more offensive than fake aborting jesus ', 
  i said ` murdering 6 muslims to send a message ', 
  you said ` no that does n't count ', 
  while to the direct victims and family the violence may take priority over any offence , to the muslims ( and other religions in other terror attacks ) , the shooter is implicity saying `` i and others like me hate and despise you so much that we are willing to kill you ' , and the action behind is far more offensive than the empty threat of fake-abortion,
