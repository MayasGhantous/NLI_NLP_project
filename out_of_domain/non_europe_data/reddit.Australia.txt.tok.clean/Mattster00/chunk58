  1800 's : my slaves want basic rights, 
  1900 's : negros want to be treated like human beings,

  i ech you, 
   if praising colonialism is white supremacist then you 'd be right, 
  no mercy to r/sequelmemes, 
  south america is technically america, 
  not from a millenial, 
  probably that calling for the genocide of muslims is a-ok but stepping on a flag deserves deportation, 
   workers of the world unite !, 
  we have nothing to lose but our coalition seats !,

  well , he 's bringing sas together against him, 
  maybe if germany * had * hate speech laws in the 20 's and 30 's hitler never would have gotten that far,

  you were supposed to bring balance to politics , not leave it in the right wing !, 
  [ jontron if he was a big fan of the disney renaissance ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/lthvl ), 
  he did indirectly justify the deaths of millions of black people though, 
  i do n't have the exact quote on me but to paraphrase , he said ` colonialism was essentially a good thing for black africans ' , colonialism obviously including atrocities such as the [ congo free state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atrocities_in_the_congo_free_state ) , which resulted in up to 15 million deaths on its own , not to mention all the other colonies . 
  he said plenty of other racist/alt-right shit too , this is just what i was referring to specifically . 
  did n't lilith only appear in spinoff books and not in the main canon ? 
  it certainly did n't benefit the 6 million jews it killed, 
  racism ca n't be that taboo if trump can get elected, 
  probably because you were n't alive for hitler , which explains how you can have such a level of cognitive dissonance regarding his policies, 
  this from someone who believes the holocaust was a good thing, 
  just because you feel the desire to commit a second holocaust does n't mean you need to downplay the first one, 
  you are a mistake, 
  someone who supports the holocaust has no justification to call * others * hitler, 
  terra from final fantasy 6 as a playable character, 
  rich al bheds commit more crimes than poor spirans, 
  man , if supporting colonialism and race-based anti-immigration rules does n't make you racist , i 'd hate to see what you consider to actually be racist ( and it 's probably something mild like affirmative action or the movie get out ), 
  you did n't originate in america, 
  no one 's asking japan to let in more non-japanese people because they do n't have the power to do anything about it , compared to their own country where they could vote , protest or rally about it, 
  ironically trump 's country ban would have prevented his father from coming to america in the first place, 
  you might be joking , but i 've seen people legitimately argue this point, 
  so when the dae islamic hordes take over europe and transform it into the first european caliphate you 'll be ok with that ? 
  if that 's the case , then why did n't he ban saudi arabia , you know , the country that 15/19 of the 9/11 hijackers came from and that * actually * works to spread radical islam across the world ? 
  because he might stand to lose a bit of money in the process ? 
  so much for making sacrifices for the country . 
  well you have to be ok with it , because according to you land belongs to whoever is able to fight for it, 
  unless of course a muslim takes it, 
  if that 's the case , let 's go over major terror attacks in the last 16 years and see where they came from :, 
  san bernadino ( the attack that first prompted the idea of a muslim ban in the first place ) : rizwan farook , native born citizen , and tashfeen malik , born in pakistan , lived in saudi arabia , neither of which are on the ban list, 
  new york and new jersey bombings : ahmad khan rahimi , born in afghanistan , not on the list, 
  pulse nightclub shooting : omar mateen , born in afghanistan , not on the list, 
  boston marathon bombings : tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev , born in kyrgyzstan , parents from chechnya , not on the list, 
  9/11 : hijackers from saudi arabia , egypt , lebanon , united arab emirates , none of which are on the list . 
  bin laden himself was saudi born , fought in pakistan , and operated out of/hid in afghanistan , not on the list ( although he never tried to enter america personally ), 
  in terms of raw deaths from terrorism ( cutting out the 9/11 countries for being an extreme outlier ) , the top 5 sources for islamic terror deaths in the us are kuwait , cuba , kyrgyzstan , pakistan and palestine , none of which are on the list . 
  in fact , not a single terrorist from * any * of the banned countries has caused the death of a us citizen domestically since 9/11 , and some of them have n't even produced failed terrorists either ( syria/libya have n't produced a single terrorist , sudan/yemen/somalia / iraq/iran have produced terrorists that failed to kill anyone ) . 
  let that sink in . 
  if trump 's muslim ban had been in place the day after 9/11 , not a single american death would have been prevented . 
  yet , strangely enough , trump 's financial streams in the middle east would have been unaffected . 
  and what 's stopping isis from using the internet ? 
  or from isis members travelling to unbanned countries that do n't have bans of their own ? 
  and if places with isis are that much of a danger to the west , why have n't they actually done anything to the us ? 
  and ? 
  i can declare allegiance to isis right here right now , that does n't make me affiliated with them . 
  it 's a common tactic for terror groups to tack themselves onto attacks they had no role in ( where the motives are ambiguous ) in order to make themselves look more fearsome , it does n't mean they helped orchestrate it . 
  additionally , many individual terrorists will often associate themselves with terror groups in order to add credence to their actions , that does n't mean they were actually in contact . 
  even disregarding that , cutting off countries with the highest proportions of isis action does nothing to stop ( domestic us ) terror if the terrorists killing us citizens did n't come from the cut off countries . 
  even if a country is literally 99 % isis , banning them wo n't do a thing if they were n't even planning to attack the us , while a 10 % isis country planning to send 1 % of their units over * would * be a threat ... . but not if you ban them , and not the ones content with lording over their swathe of the middle east . 
  tl ; dr ( because you seem incapable of grasping it ) : banning countries where no terrorists come from while ignoring countries that terrorist * do * come from does n't work, 
  if that 's so , then they must be pretty bad at it seeing as they have n't * caused * any death to america in 16 years, 
  if you did n't play tennis for two then you 're not a real gamer, 
  n2 mines are described as ` nuclear bombs without the fallout ' ( not an exact quote ) in terms of power , which would be highly unlikely given that even the little boy used on hiroshima had a payload of 15,000 tons of tnt , so a non-nuclear device with that power would be incredibly large and heavy , making them very impractical for combat uses . 
  not from a gerudo, 
  one thing i think would have worked better would be to have the blood moon revive some spectre of calamity ganon off on a deserted island or something ( maybe link and zelda create it somehow to hone link 's skills further ) , so you can replay the fight while enjoying your success, 
  they 're obviously in a timeline where ganon seizes permanent control of the triforce and forces link and co to live out their own personal hell forever, 
  hopefully they make it freely toggleable ( choosing one at the start ) , while giving you two stars on your save file if you never switch to normal mode, 
  something i 'd like to see the dlc add is a mannequin that you can put armour on , and have pose with a weapon or bow, 
  something else i thought of would be some kind of elemental shields that convert damage dealt of the corresponding element into hp , yet instantly break against the opposite element ( for balance ), 
  i 'd rather they put a cap on how much you can eat over time ( eg 1 food and 1 elixir every minute ) so you do n't have to keep darting back to storage for food, 
  i also like how one of the female hylians in the town sees through your disguise but decides not to tell on you because hylian bro-ship . 
  future expansion location ? 
  with regards to your third point , [ a green tunic variation ( called the set of the wild ) is a reward for beating all 120 shrines , so if anything they 'd die that ] ( / spoiler ), 
  maybe they could be some kind of ` sticky ' gloves that increase grip at the cost of speed , or a special set bonus for all 3 climb speed up pieces, 
  well , they share the same language , the same government , the same foods , the same pop culture, 
  science victory : america has n't been to alpha centauri , they 're dependant on russia ships to get to space, 
  domination victory : america does n't have the ability to conquer the capital cities of the entire world, 
  diplomatic victory : this requires actual diplomacy rather than invading countries for their oil and pulling out of nato, 
  cultural victory : america does n't have that largest amount of proportionate tourists in the world ( that 's france ) , which is what the cultural victory is dependant on ( so despite the blue jeans meme , the prevalence of american media is n't a point in their favour ), 
  religious victory : christianity and islam ( two largest religions ) have their holy cities in the middle east , while native american religions are n't widespread, 
  time victory : america may be the best at some of these , but it 's unlikely they 'd lock them all down by 2050, 
  or just apply for a private healthcare job , which did n't go away under obamacare and would n't go away under, 
  universal healthcare . 
  i 'm convinced that republicans and libertarians believe that the government literally chain doctors to operating tables under gunpoint if they refuse to work in public healthcare, 
  a dead hand boss where the hands drag you down from literally any height in the sky while gliding would be great, 
  probably people assuming that since 99 % of the time sex equals gender that sex must always equal gender , and not applying the scientific method to the idea and putting proper research into transgenderism to study it, 
  til that vaccinations cause transgenderism, 
  do n't knock animated incestuous armpits like that man , they * change * you , know what i 'm saying ? 
  i think that 's more than quality of life, 
  is n't the requirement for heaven basically ` do n't be an asshole and say sorry if you are one ' ? 
  that 's hardly extreme vetting . 
  it took hitler 6 years to invade poland , hopefully trump will be out a couple of years before then, 
   thou hast undone our mother, 
   villain , i have done thy mother,
