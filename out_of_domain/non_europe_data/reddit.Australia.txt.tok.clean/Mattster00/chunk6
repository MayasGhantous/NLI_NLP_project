  [ * / u/mattslaughing * ** all atheists = scientists ** ] ( / / #phd ), 
  i 'm really feeling it !, 
  checkmate fundies . 
  rekt, 
  i have that extension , and your comment looks like it 's saying nicolas cage to nicolas cage , which made me confused for a second before realising it . 
  that 's just young earth creationists . 
  this post was based on * not * taking the bible literally , as it assumes the evolution of humans at a scientifically based point in time , and methods of dating the bible verified by science and history . 
  of course . 
  my mistake . 
  there was no one moment that made be go `` right , i 'm an atheist '' . 
  i was raised roman catholic and stayed that way until my adolescence , when i began thinking about some of the weirder parts of the bible . 
  that led me to question it , and i began doing research on the internet , and came out the other side an atheist . 
  then why is there no record of such interactions until around ( geological ) recent times , which is only about 1/66 of humanity existing ? 
  how did god talk to humanity if they had n't yet developed language ( or at least a language sophisticated enough to have the sort of conversations in the bible ) ? 
  did god talk in caveperson ( sidenote : it would be hilarious to hear god talking in grunts ) ? 
  that 's not an absurd rule , that 's a common sense rule . 
  can i procreate now ? 
  all wars will be settled by 12 year olds playing call of duty over xbox live . 
  ( i am assuming that by your use of ` median ' , that she is at the middle of the road ) well , since i 'm sitting in my house posting on reddit , my decision would not really save her at all . 
  however , assuming i was watching from the sidewalk , i would still likely not be able to reach her since i am notorious amongst my friends for being incredibly slow . 
  a more practical option rather than running to save her would be to throw some kind of solid object at her , to gain her attention and distract her from trying to walk into traffic . 
  i would then call out to her and say that walking into traffic is incredibly stupid , and that she should wait there until the traffic slows . 
  if she is deaf , i would make a stop sign with my hand and use gestures to get my message across , and if she is both blind and deaf she would be likely to have a seeing eye dog to help her . 
  however , i have one point to raise . 
  how did she reach the middle of the road in the first place ? 
  if traffic is so bad on one side , it would stand to reason that the other side is bad too , therefore she never could have made it over in the first place . 
  unless she arrived at the critical moment before traffic , or was waiting there for several minutes before traffic arrived . 
  however , i now realise that none of this reasoning is common sense , and therefore i am unable to procreate . 
  please forgive me my lord . 
  my lord is merciful !, 
  in total , all these consoles probably have thousands of exclusives between them .

  what i also meant is , what were these humans before god ? 
  did they have souls ? 
  did they go to heaven or hell since they had no concept of sin ? 
  i 'm not really sure how you can have a love sponsored anti gay rally .

  he would have had a lot less employees in the modern day . 
  that was not cool dude . 
  i almost had a heart attack from hearing we might lose you to the fundies ( it definitely was n't because of all the mountain dew and doritos i ingest ) . 
  everyone knows that 2 deaths every 3 weeks is literally the soviets . 
  get your facts right shitlord . 
  atheism does n't really allow or disallow anything . 
  it 's up to the atheist to decide what is right or wrong . 
  mfw when i lose an argument . 
  there is no face because i have never lost an internet argument .

  this kinda sounds like extreme voyeurism . 
  i am personally more offended that there have n't been any genderfluid , genderqueer , and non binary gender presidents .

  yeah but you 're a cis het white male so your opinion is immediately invalid .

  mariana trench, 
  `` hey i 'm an angel . 
  oh my god '', 
  i see what you did there . 
  something that can only be the work of god , such as raising the dead , regrowing a limb , or time travel , that can independently be verified and tested multiple times and viewed directly by me , and not through an ancient book . 
  a better example would probably be with something like unicorns or dragons . 
  you might go `` oh but i do n't see any dragons '' , then he would go `` but only i can see , feel , smell , hear and taste them '' , and then you would most likely not believe a dragon was really there , since in your eyes , there is no proof of the dragon . 
  i think shitlady works better that shitlordess . 
  dps queues in ffxiv will be largely unchanged . 
  fairly certain knights were always cool . 
  nice meme though . 
  also , in cases like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_james_bulger ) , and others children have committed vile and cruel crimes in the past . 
  10 years old would generally be seen as age of accountability ( some believe that the age of accountability is 13 , based on [ this ] ( http://www.gotquestions.org/age-of-accountability.html ) ) , so should they be held accountable ? 
  and if they are , then why not the others ? 
  what he said . 
  and if you argue `` well then i 'd go to hell '' , then would n't it be truly moral to sacrifice your own shot at eternal paradise to help others get theirs ? 
  from that same wikipedia article :, 
   sociologists robert bartholomew and erich goode offer the zeitoun apparitions as a prominent case of mass delusion : `` it appears that the marian observers were predisposed by religious background and social expectation to interpreting the light displays as related to the virgin mary . 
  after all , would you really be the one to say , in a crowd of theists `` lol nope guys it 's just a light '' ? 
  so no . 
  still not convinced . 
  some laws i follow because i want to , and feel good about doing them e.g. 
  not murdering , not raping . 
  some laws i do n't really want to follow , but i accept that they 're necessary and do them anyway e.g. 
  paying taxes . 
  but really , what is the difference between a christian and an atheist following rules ? 
  atheists have the law to punish them , christians have god to do it . 
  the only difference is that atheists have to answer to the lawmaker sooner . 
  it 's not impossible , but there 's no reason to believe that unicorns exist without evidence . 
  ` gamers are literally isis ', 
  while we may never know for certain if there is or is n't a god , the logical step from there would be disbelief . 
  because we ca n't also know for certain that harry potter does n't exist , or the fsm , or nathan drake . 
  we can look at the evidence , weigh it up , and decide with reasonable certainty that there is not a god . 
  after all , absence of disproof is not disproof of absence .

  there is no good or bad atheistic government . 
  it 's not like there 's a book of rules atheistic governments have to follow . 
  it 's the leader 's decisions that make him , based on your own standards , a good or bad leader . 
  nothing has any objective value . 
  it 's like asking if gold has any intrinsic value . 
  because the the person said why ca n't science and the b ( lie ) ble mix ? 
  the answer ? 
  because god do n't real .
