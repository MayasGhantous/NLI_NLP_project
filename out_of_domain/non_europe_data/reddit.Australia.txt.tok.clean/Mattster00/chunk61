  [ this is america ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2017/02/16/national-politics/images/botsford170216trump12205.jpg?uuid=1r67dvsjeeafss2pp8na7q ) . 
  not a single native in sight . 
  this is population replacement :, 
  your weeabooism and your lust for waifus has already done that, 
  remember when trump was a voice of peace trying to avoid military confrontations and hillary was the warmonger ? 
  nice,

  assuming they were part of the ` initial wave ' of lilith/adam beings they may have had some sort of advanced power supply provided by the black/white moons , which was simply transferred to the geofront when gehirn/nerv was installed there . 
  all but 3 ( technically 4 ) characters were recast for the dubs , barring spike spencer for shinji , allison keith for misato , tiffany grant for asuka and john swasey for gendo ( tristan macavery was his original va , but for the directors cut in 2004 swasey redubbed him ) , so if you had any particular attachment to another english va 's work or dislike it when dub actors get recast you might be disappointed . 
  overall , as someone who watched the original series + end and the rebuilds i 'd say the rebuilds are superior in terms of the acting skill of the returning characters , and for recast characters i 'd say it was about 50/50 whether or not i liked them better in terms of acting and the way their voice sounded ( kaji was someone i liked better , while kensuke was someone i liked worse ) . 
  in a world where witcher 3 exists , no idea can be called objectively fresh, 
  i have absolutely no idea how it would work but i 'd like to see a doom anime somehow . 
  maybe a prequel to doom 4 set in argent d'nur ? 
  huh , i guess that copy of shovel knight and super bomberman r i bought must have been a fever dream, 
  early on it got games like assassins creed and call of duty , but only the ones that were on ps3/360 too, 
  8 years ago the ps4/xb1 did n't even exist, 
  i feel like yaoi would be better off replacing lust in this comment, 
  maybe he ends up joining yui in eva-01 with 01 jetting off into space like in eoe ? 
  just one idea , probably not likely . 
  and the ds was meant to coexist with the gba ( and gamecube ) , but ended up supplanting the former . 
  there 's no reason for nintendo to continue to support the 3ds for more than a few months after the switch 's release unless switch suffers a major flop . 
  you 're missing the real benefit here , and that 's that america is n't sliding into a degenerate welfare state by using socialism to feed school students, 
  it 's the literal nazis , for the majority of people propaganda is n't necessary to hate them, 
  i hoped it would be obvious , but now i realise that nothing in the presence of t_d can be conclusively satire, 
  it 's not an argument , it 's literally a quote from iwata `` i expect it to become a third pillar , next to gamecube and game boy . '', 
  ` dispite ', 
  i do n't remember the name , but it was the korok trial shrine where you need to stealth follow the korok through the lost woods to reach it,

  he 's got magical beasts on his side too , and probably has people equivalent to the snatchers who followed the same views but were n't a part of the privileged inner circle , kinda like how even at it 's peak only 10 % of nazi germany were official members of the nazi party . 
  i think rowling said somewhere ( no source tho ) that there were about 1 million wizards in the entire world , which based on the uk 's population over the world population ( 64.1 million / 7.5 billion = 0.008 ) would give the uk around 8000 wizards , although it would be less in the 90 's when hp is set . 
  it might be that he does n't want to risk anyone divining a vision of lupin that happens to have him as a werewolf, 
  they could come out with gamecube themed joycons instead, 
  not if it 's voluntary ^ ^ tm, 
  for games purchased on the eshop for other regions , do any problems arise when you play them on your main account ? 
  just bought disgaea 5 on the jp eshop ( normally aus account ) , and was wondering if i still have to play using only the jp account or not, 
  witcher 3 in japanese is the best jrpg of all time, 
  surely the muslim hordes bent on overrunning france would raise diversity a bit, 
  because it 's not in hd rumble, 
   religion is the opiate of the masses , except for islam guys that 's pretty cool, 
  you are a bold one . 
  you want to go home and rethink your kenobi, 
  i think project octopath is going to be taking that spot since it 's being made by the bravely default team iirc , but i agree bravely third would be great, 
  it 's a dad legend, 
  xenoblade warriors would be pretty cool , if x and the upcoming 2 were included, 
  you 're stupid for thinking climate change is a hoax and if joe rogan ( idk much about him ) thinks that then he 's an idiot too, 
  in cast ( le ) vania 2 : simons quest for the nes enemies lie to you too, 
  you know what else does n't have split screen ? 
  the witcher 3 . 
  and since witcher 3 is objectively perfect , that means that lack of split screen is a good thing, 
  are we blind ? 
  deploy the legion !, 
  it 's the schrodinger 's white : white people are simultaneously the master race that deserve to dominate society , and yet are always at risk of being outbred by something as simple as immigration and interracial marriage . 
  it 's a tough life , i tell you . 
  good thing that trump decided to stop destabilising the region with drone strikes , right ? 
  considering that your op was talking about benghazi , * libya * , asking about syria is n't the right question . 
  overall , [ trump has authorised drone strikes at a rate of approximately 4x that obama had ] ( https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/25604-drone-strikes-up-432-percent-under-donald-trump ) ( although his raw numbers have yet to surpass obama 's due to time ) , so it 's hard to claim he 's taking a more peaceful approach than obama .

  what the right sees, 
   he never * really * meant that mexico was going to pay for the wall , it 's all 4d chess you cuck globalists . 
  i think it 's meant to be symbolic of his lovelessness rather than the actual physical cause,
