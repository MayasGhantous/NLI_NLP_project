  final fantasy vii ( merging viii as my next spot ) : yes, 
  subnautica : i 'd * like * to see it , but the game utterly shreds the xb1 now due to unoptimisation ( they intend to optimise once the game leaves early access ) , and i 'd be hesitant to see how a switch port would fare, 
  shovel knight : already on platform, 
  terraria : confirmed for platform, 
  doom 4 : unsure how well it would run even at 720p , but yes if it would run well . 
  evangelion was the first anime i watched knowing it was anime ( as opposed to something like pokemon or dbz where i thought it was just a cartoon ) , though this was a long time after either of those shows released . 
  death note and mario kart 8 deluxe . 
  first place is in for a rough time, 
   open the warp pipe doors cappy . 
   * i 'm sorry mario , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that *, 
  given that the bishop is concealing the true reason for the demons arrival and lisa 's death , he is effectively ' a miserable little pile of secrets ' ( this may be a coincidence ) . 
  this is a nice meme and all , but what about the demon attack on the gresitians ? 
  instead of koopa shells he 'd just throw shinigami realm apples, 
  gabriel belmont if los is included , soma cruz otherwise, 
   i embrace god and satan equally, 
  i think those guys are kinda opposites, 
  lem me get uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh orrectly endered, 
  he kinda looks like a magic werewolf with spines , which i do n't recall in any game , so he 's likely a netflix original, 
  that just sounds like a plus to me, 
  what about that time dylan roof shot up a church ? 
  considering that big rigs : over the road racing is objectively the best non-witcher game of all time , and fallout 4 is a g with no rp , that 's a poor comparison, 
  understanda le have a nice day, 
  for your second question , i 'd say that yuki * thought * he was imagining his conversations with deus when he was in his head , and deus did n't feel the need to correct him since it gave him a chance to hear things from yuki that he 'd never tell a real person, 
  finished this week :, 
  ** death note ** : 10/10 . 
  a phenomenal show . 
  unfortunately for me , i went in knowing a couple of the big spoilers , yet still managed to be thrilled and surprised . 
  found the show dropped a * tiny * bit in quality from [ episode 25 ] ( / s `` when l died and was replaced by near '' ) , but overall it was still great . 
  overall preferred english ( brad swaille as light , brian drummond as ryuk and alessandro juliani as l were standouts , but the rest were decent ) . 
  ** netflix castlevania ** : short and sweet . 
  felt it lagged a bit in eps 2/3 with the speakers/church taking up too much focus , but never got particularly bored . 
  the fight with [ trevor and ] ( / s `` alucard '' ) in ep 4 was beautifully animated , but trevor could have shown a bit more class . 
  disappointed that none of the classic castlevania themes have shown up yet ( a good bloody tears in the credits would have been nice ) . 
  overall 8/10 , hopefully season 2 improves . 
  currently watching :, 
  ** durarara ** ( 4 eps in ) : so far enjoying it . 
  good cast so far , johnny yong bosch as izaya the standout . 
  visuals and sound decent so far , and curious to see where the story goes from here . 
  tentatively 8-8 .5 / 10 . 
  there 's more than one way to interpret that, 
  i believe the song you 're looking for ( i have n't done the sam quest but i looked at it on youtube ) is [ fury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctb0l1msq-m ) , which also appears in brayflox hm and a couple of other places . 
  so is it ` we need guns to overthrow the government ' or ` we need guns to protect the government ' ? 
  i think you can see abraham erskine somewhere too, 
   knock knock , er , clank clank, 
   it 's the people with the knightmares . 
   and they made an empire . 
   and then everyone else copied their knightmares, 
  it 's an orphanage called wammy 's house , founded by quillish wammy ( watari ) to train gifted orphans , and later to train a successor to l. 
  for question 1 , light specifically wrote that naomi would commit suicide without causing a fuss/making a disturbance , and yelling out ` hey this guy here is kira ! ', 
  would certainly fall under that umbrella . 
   hot psycho bitch and people like hot psycho bitches in anime, 
  that 's yuno , yuki 's the other guy, 
  durarara , madoka magica and chivalry of a failed knight ( all in progress ), 
  but remember , gay people are the * real * sexual degenerates, 
  to be fair on se , none of the mobile ports have added micro-transactions , it 's just their new mobile games ( brave exvius , mobius , all the bravest ) , that do . 
  they are on youtube for individual renting , but if you have it then they 're also on netflix, 
  must be all the fallout from the tritium reactors !, 
  no , australia ( probably should have specified ), 
  except if you just did some deep soul searching and need people to congratulate you, 
  there 's spider-man 1-3 as well as amazing spider-man , but idk about anything else, 
  yeah , the ancestral white home of north america , with white ancestry dating back millenia, 
  symphony of the night, 
  rondo of blood/dracula x chronicles ( tie ), 
  aria of sorrow, 
  portrait of ruin, 
  lords of shadow, 
  mirror of fate, 
  dracula 's curse, 
  dawn of sorrow, 
  12 : harmony of dissonance, 
  13 : simon 's quest, 
  14 : circle of the moon ( only a little bit into this one ), 
  have n't yet played enough to judge : lords of shadow 2 , legacy of darkness , harmony of despair , judgment , spinoffs . 
  in evangelion , episode 1 ( sachiel ) , 19 ( zeruel ) , 22 ( arael ) and 24 ( kaworu ) are the ones i usually go back to, 
  early on ben 's comics were more along the lines of ` new world order , republicans and democrats are both bad ' conspiracies , but then 4chan edited the ( ( ( financial elites ) ) ) into jews which made him upset and go full trumpet eventually, 
  the sub is pro-meme , and is for or against parts of christianity based on their meme potential, 
  maybe he can get it treated by the ahca he tried to vote in ? 
  political maneuvering , mecha battles and eye magic, 
  more like nietzsche-jou, 
  i think that was only in certain regions ( us was one ) . 
  just like todd killed rp mechanics in fallout and elder scrolls ? 
  he may be trying to punish voldemort for trying to use horcruxes to escape him ( similarly to how the objects he gave the first two brothers led to their deaths ) , but does n't wish to directly intervene this time and so gave harry the chance to do it for him, 
  dark haired teen gets given pinkeye , uses it to work out his parental issue and take over the world while negotiating product placement with pizza hut, 
  [ madder sky ] ( https://youtu.be/t2tgeiyu9ku ) - code geass, 
  i think the maximum amount of time you can make someone live for is 24 days ( as in , they die in that time no matter when you write ) , so you 'd get a lot of unwarranted attention not long after that if someone notices the transaction, 
  cc would have probably chosen suzaku over me , so i 'd just end up shot by generic brittanian grunts, 
  because fuck you, 
  `` except donald trump though , he 's an outsider '', 
  to be fair it was at infinity-1 before then, 
  is this a political compass meme ? 
  dude wtf i love satan now, 
  ` the only people who should kill are those prepared to die themselves ' - lelouch vi brittania , code geass, 
  code geass r3 , overlord s2 , evangelion final, 
  that depends on whether or not light would get the death penalty, 
  not necessarily never , they could have had a job but could n't cope and quit/got fired, 
  [ suleiman the magnificent had a pretty good one ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_imperial_harem ), 
  they just disrupt other country 's democracies, 
  axiom verge and bloodstained, 
  is this the food version of my dad can beat up your dad ? 
  day one definitely :,
