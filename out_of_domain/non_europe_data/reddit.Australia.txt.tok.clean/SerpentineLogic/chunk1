the income you need to replace ships is lower than you think . 
  for instance , a tech 2 fit rifter tops out at [ about 8 million isk ] ( http://yar5k1.blogspot.com/2011/09/bad-run.html ) , and a tech 1 fit is substantially cheaper . 
  phew , lucky that eve is not a game that glories in messing with other peoples ' fun , then . 
  is n't being in test punishment enough ? 
  a few things . 
  * bombers are for killing battleships . 
  attempting to kill anything smaller will be frustratingly difficult . 
  * bombers can be flown solo , [ if you know how ] ( http://eve-search.com/thread/1202308/page/1 ) . 
  * generally , gate guns will kill you before you kill anything else , so they 're best used in nullsec, 
  * conveniently , [ dreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/ ) lives in nullsec, 
  both those implants ( the imperial navy & republic fleet ) come from low-sec cosmos . 
  the republic fleet one is a possible drop from the same mission that drops the shaqil 's speed enhancer . 
  learning from the [ mistakes of others ] ( http://yar5k1.blogspot.com/2011/09/bad-run.html ) helps . 
  a bit of reading will save you a lot of exploding . 
  alternatively , hook up with agony empire , red vs blue , the tuskers or whoever and learn small-gang pvp where there 's less chance of a single mistake causing you to go home in your pod . 
  listen to the fc , try to anticipate their orders , and , when you inevitably do screw up and explode , listen to what you did wrong . 
  as i 've said [ elsewhere ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/vagabond-pilots-read-this/ ) , having pvp experience is fine and good , but learning the right lesson from your mistakes is not guaranteed . 
  you must really hate your friends . 
  the last eve newsletter said that the power of two promotion ( six months subscription for $ 50 , provided it 's a new character ) will be returning ` some time in october ' . 
  ( note : not * real * bot ), 
  hoping that [ this one ] ( http://lh5.ggpht.com/-vtfvq0r9d1i/twmbc87a_qi/aaaaaaaadlk/dtvv3ganpl8/s912/endymion_by_thorionart-d30lcj2.jpg ) is the gallente one ... 
  fit a cloak to the carriers and send them slow-boating in a random direction . 
  switch to an alt until you can get enough support to evacuate them . 
  or just accept that ships die in w-space , and that if you 're any good at killing sleepers , you 've recouped your isk tenfold . 
  cultural victory !, 
  some links to corporations who can help :, 
  * [ eve university ] ( http://www.eveuniversity.org/ ) for help and advice, 
  * [ project halibut ] ( http://projecthalibut.org/about/ ) for those who are a little more advanced than eve uni caters for , but still need some tips and friendly people to fleet with, 
  * [ red vs blue ] ( http://altruist.azual.co.uk/2011/10/rifters-are-red-merlins-are-blue-whats.html ) for instant-action pvp on tap , only a few jumps from jita . 
  * [ agony empire ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/agony_empire_%28player_alliance%29 ) or [ ouch ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/ouch_%28player_corporation%29 ) for nullsec pvp training ( agony even runs pvp courses ), 
  of course , you could always jump into the deep end and join dreddit , but some people like their level 4 pve backbone . 
  alternatively , get your faction standings up by non-obvious methods :, 
  * do all the noob career agent arcs ( there 's three noob systems per faction ) , since they provide hefty standings boosts on completion . 
  * do the sisters of eve epic story arc , which can provide good faction standings increase , depending on who you choose to ally with . 
  * do the old features that ccp has neglected to update , like the circle routes etc. 
  * pay isk -  hand in tags at a data center -  receive standings, 
  that is * so * accurate in an attenborough voice . 
  rate of fire, 
  i hear systems in omist are going cheap . 
  of course , your landlord changes every week or so , but that just adds to the compelling user-generated content we love . 
  lots of * other players * ? 
  in * my * mmo ? 
  you 're better off with an amarr frigate or something with lots of low slots . 
  fit some inertial stabilizers/nanofiber internal structures and a bunch of overdrive injectors to slowboat between gates and you 're set to win at ~ ~ eve ~ ~ autopilot, 
  we believe you , and would never gank you just to check . 
  then roll with a [ podla drake ] ( http://nashhkadavreveblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/help-desk-4-how-to-fit-drake.html ) and accept that your tank will suffer . 
  watch [ this introductory video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0m7jkv3xkq ) . 
  [ choose a fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/vagabond-pilots-read-this/ ) then take off a medium neut for a cloak . 
  [ basic guide to incursions ( 4 part series ) ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/08/guide-introduction-to-incursions-part-1.html ), 
  i 'd take off the damage control , then . 
  replace it with a reactor control unit , fit some shield tank rigs instead of acrs , call it a day . 
  do you want the map on your wall ? 
  then buy it , otherwise use [ dotlan maps ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net ) for real-time data . 
  do n't know about the hardcopy of the guide , but if it has more than the pdf , get it . 
  if it does n't , then give it a miss ( unless you want to buy it for potentially giving to someone else and get them hooked too ) . 
  you can , of course , unsubscribe , which will prevent subsequent subscription fees from being charged . 
  ( you can still play until your sub runs out ), 
  not sure whether there 's an option to `` stop my account right now but let me keep the playing time for later '' .

  grr . 
  i 've been in a few null sec alliances ( all of which ended in a spy dissolving them but none directly attributable to mittens ) and there 's a constant friction between the pvp players and the industry guys . 
  zulu mentioned his aim to make null sec alliances more independent from high sec ( but encourage trade between alliances yeah right ) . 
  looking at the sheer volume of stuff manufactured and invented in high sec vs the distinct lack of raw materials and willing miners in null , it seems incredibly unlikely that this is achievable ( you 've already heard mention that a single fleet fight goes through all of deklein 's ammo manufacturing capacity every six minutes ) . 
  do you think that changing the focus towards economic incentives to produce in null ( or disincentives in high , such as scaling manufacturing and research costs ala office rent ) would prove an easier alternative than more drastic measures ? 
  living in australia is like living in canada , except bitterly hot when canada is bitterly cold . 
  there are more jobs than people due to the mining boom , and we spend most of our time complaining about how the houses we live in are worth too much money . 
  multi-coloured , [ washable plastic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banknotes_of_the_australian_dollar#current_series_.28polymer.29 ) money . 
  it 's even different sized and coloured so you do n't accidentally tip strippers c-bills instead of fivers . 
  not that i would know . 
  because i use dollar coins instead . 
  evidence : australia is literally the [ second-best ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-03/australia-is-second-best-place3a-un/3620398 ) place to live in the entire world . 
  nope , still [ world-class ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/m4249/til_that_the_australian_minimum_wage_is_about/c2xy39m ) place to live . 
  that 's because the minimum wage scales up from ~ 50 % at the mimimum legal working age ( 14yrs 9 months ? ), 
  up to 100 % at age 18 . 
  this is true . 
  australian 's health care system is a two-tier system , with universal healthcare for all ( but with inevitable waiting lists ) , and/or private health insurance that the government encourages with a rebate if you have it , and extra tax if you do n't . 
  private health insurance sounds expensive , but it starts at maybe $ 10 per week , since there 's no bull -- with pre-existing conditions since the health care providers ca n't refuse insurance the same way the us hmos did . 
  all societies set their own limits on what is and is n't acceptable . 
  australians have evidently taken the view that a working wage that 's high enough to live off without resorting to a second job or questionable means is worth the higher unemployment and lessened business growth that it costs . 
  as an australian , it 's called giving people a fair go . 
  sometimes it floods . 
  i was quite put out that university tuition ( hecs ) rose from $ 2500 to $ 4700 per semester while i was enrolled . 
  then i realised that it was ridiculously cheap anyway , and it was basically the cheapest no-interest loan i 'd get in my entire life and quit complaining . 
  also [ many jobs ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/business/bhp-tips-jobs-bonanza-20110928-1kxbt.html ) if you 're up for it . 
  an alternative point of view is that it * removes * a large set of people being paid less than their marginal value . 
  i guess we 'll have to agree to disagree and let the economists sort it out . 
  by the way , how 's your economy doing lately ? 
  bondi beach . 
  * eight kilometres from sydney cbd, 
  * awesome sand and surf, 
  * topless sunbathing allowed, 
  apparently , eight of the top ten deadliest snakes live in australia . 
  sometimes i think aussies try to be competitive with * everything * . 
  [ confirmed ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/7/7a/saxtonisgoddamnedmanly.png ), 
  sorry to disappoint , but we have terribly dangerous spiders . 
  fortunately , the poisonous snakes or dive-bombing magpies eat them .
