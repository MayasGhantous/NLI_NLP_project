  this includes your own client ; when you make a portrait change , it puts a medium-resolution portrait into your local cache , and picks up the high-res one when the server gets around to making it . 
  eve vets do n't die ; they just retire and build supercaps . 
  it was about the time they started flying backwards . 
  killboards use data from [ prices.c0rporation.com ] ( http://prices.c0rporation.com/ ), 
  . . besides them being really uncomfortable to wear ? 
  now i know why i 've never seen an infamous cod ; they all died in the war . 
  mining towns . 
  ** tech 1 **, 
  for speed ? 
  generally , the less skill required to get into , the faster an industrial will go . 
  the fastest would be the amarr sigil , which can go even faster when nano 'd up . 
  for tank ? 
  industrial ships shield tank ( hello expanded cargoholds ) so you want ships with lots of mid slots ( ofc the more mids a ship has , the fewer lows , so there 's a trade-off ) . 
  this means badger mk ii , mammoth and iteron v , although the badger and mammoth have fewer low slots than the itty . 
  note , however , that t1 industrial ships tend to die fairly easily regardless , since they do n't have enough power grid to fit extenders or plates . 
  i once survived a single-tempest suicide gank in highsec - if it was a tornado , i 'd have been dead . 
  to this end , most people fit for cargo instead of tank , and just do n't haul expensive stuff in them . 
  oh , i suppose you could use a lot of reinforced bulkheads to make an industrial ship tank fairly decently ( perhaps to the same level as a battlecruiser ) at the cost of all your cargo room . 
  obv this is best achieved in an iteron v , since it has the most hull hp and the most low slots ), 
  ** t2 transport ships **, 
  in general , all the blockade runners are decent , and all the deep-space transports are not really decent . 
  all the transport ships have something going for them , although a few stand out :, 
  * prowler can fit cloak + probe launcher for w-space fun times . 
  it can not fit a repackaged cruiser though , even with max skills and rigs . 
  * mastodon and prowler have nice shield resists , being minmatar . 
  * amarr ships have enough low slots to haul a huge amount , or in the case of a blockade runner , be nano 'd up while still hauling a decent amount, 
  * nobody really uses the active tank bonuses . 
  best for autopilot ? 
  [ fenrir , no question ] ( http://www.whiteroseconventicle.com/technology/83-freighters/926-minmatar-fenrir-fast-efficient-freighter.html ) . 
  best for cargohold : caldari charon . 
  only really matters if you are 100 % full * all the time * . 
  all of them are decent . 
  whichever one you want ; the differences are not very pronounced , compared to other stuff like dreads or carriers . 
  in a vacuum , i 'd go for the amarr freighter line-up . 
  amarr ice is interdiction-proof because there are belts * everywhere * , the performance is pretty decent , and imo they look the best . 
  if it has a decent tank , ~ ~ most many ~ ~ some will survive a single alpha strike . 
  it 's doubtful whether any could survive a second volley though . 
  * clear your cache, 
  * contact customer support ( the portrait change might have stalled on the server . 
  i do n't know how rare this is , but it 's possible ), 
  nope , because then you start using scourge fury for the +30 % damage boost . 
  cloud ring is pretty neat . 
  look at [ this fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) and adjust to your budget . 
  the person i got the fit from said that the faction items were just whatever he 'd picked up over the last few months . 
  walls of text arent informative just because someone spent the time to write them . 
  usually theres $ 5 deals around expansion time . 
  i think you may have missed the last one . 
  1.1 patch is tomorrow btw . 
  you may already know about shift-moving the probes , but alt-moving is even better . 
  not in lowsec ~, 
   having to pee ** in ** a complicated costume . 
  start by getting into the smaller 5-man incursion sites , building up your fc skills and learning what roles need to be filled and which ships are best at it , then move onto the 10-man and higher sites . 
  sometimes more than 100 % replacement . 
  in any jump freighter , you get enough 425mm railguns to make a supercarrier . 
  not on my main . 
  upvoting for good book recommendation . 
  blindfolds probably fell off quickly anyway . 
  your overview, 
  well , flying that cnr looked like it was more exciting . 
  did you run out of cap boosters or just forget to reload ? 
  bet you were tractoring wrecks like crazy , hoping for some to have dropped as loot . 
  [ http://eveprincessbride.wordpress.com/] ( http://eveprincessbride.wordpress.com/ ), 
  < x  furies are a 30 % damage buff . 
  * kinda * worth it ... 
  and yet , while we as a community have common ground on what is in need of fixes ( fw , assault ships , nighthawk , slave vs crystals , pos , sov , supercarriers , mining etc ) but when it comes time to make suggestions on how to fix them , we go full retard . 
  ** tldr ; ** players spot problems but are terrible at solutions . 
  [ 1 ] and you * never * go full retard, 
  an entire state away . 
  if only it were possible to change your name . 
  but clearly this is impossible . 
  i can see how you 'd be paranoid , since every computer you login to , you suddenly have * root access * . 
  25 % better , in fact . 
  ... and that quality is -20 to access them , but +20 for rewards . 
  it 's standard ammo for my tengu , without which i would never have broken 750dps . 
  allows me to two-shot battlecruisers instead of three-shot them and ten-shot battleships so i get exactly four battleship kills per reload . 
  all for , what , a couple of million isk per hour ? 
  maybe they 're federation navy gardes vov, 
  oh , is * that * why the call them tenderloins ? 
  my cycle time is closer to 3.4 seconds , but yes , it 's still worth an extra million isk per hour to clear anomalies faster . 
  ejects in structure, 
  even flying freighters, 
  and my axe !, 
  [ my thoughts on the subject ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/nullsec-noob-training-plan/ ) ( long ), 
  passive shield , otherwise you run out of cap boosters . 
  i once got almost kicked for being too knowledgable and thus must be a spy . 
  prometheus was totally under the radar until it turned out he suggested the assault frigate changes . 
  still might not be enough to get him in . 
  the third high slot of a covert ops frigate is for a cyno , not a * gun * . 
  probably easiest to read the goonswarm shrugged [ campaign introduction ] ( http://www.kugutsumen.com/showthread.php?11617-goonswarm-shrugged-the-gallente-ice-interdiction ) . 
  some of the links you 'll need gsf wiki access to view , but the fits ( in particular , the catalyst fit ) should be what you 're looking for . 
  oh , and pick up a [ cerebral accelerator ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=2838 ) for the character . 
  i hear +20 % damage is pretty nice . 
  how 's it for isk generation tho ? 
  skirmish warfare specialization v checking in, 
   and i felt like such a fool . 
  that 's a * good * thing . 
  if you felt bad losing space pixels , imagine how bad you 'd feel gambling away real money . 
  do n't ~ ~ fly ~ ~ gamble what you ca n't afford to lose . 
  i [ wrote a thing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) about it , once . 
  it 's much more profitable in low-sec though , since i only pay 1 % tax instead of 10 % .
