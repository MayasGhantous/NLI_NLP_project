  jester has a series of incursion articles on [ his blog ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com ) . 
   pain , suffering and reactions, 
  but you repeat yourself . 
  just follow #tweetfleet and you 'll pick them up soon enough . 
  last time i went to the argyle mine , they mentioned their product line was, 
  * pink diamonds ( apparently one shoebox-full is mined per year ), 
  * ` white ' diamonds ( three dump trucks full per year ), 
  * ` champagne ' diamonds ( clear-but-yellowish ones they have to market themselves ), 
  * ` cognac ' diamonds ( clear-but-brownish ones they have to market themselves ), 
  you forgot, 
  step 14b : stop your alliance taking your titan off you after its built . 
   with a little luck , what we leave behind might be preserved for the future as well . 
  we 'll need more than luck . 
  i ca n't even play my beatles tapes any more .

   shit like this has no place in a game like eve . 
  so , who made you spokesman for eve 's society ? 
   again , in a video game when you are given all the tools necessary to get away from it should it be your issue , why are you not taking the steps to prevent it ? 
  why do kids get bullied when they are given all the tools necessary to change schools ? 
  or maybe they should put the effort into stopping the bullying instead . 
  ` just walk away ' does n't solve anything . 
  go to low sec , kill one battleship rat , change systems , rinse , repeat . 
  as quickly as possible . 
  the traditional w-space build is a rr tengu blob . 
  in k-space , an rr dominix blob works well . 
  ishtars take less damage but fitting the reps can be an issue . 
  ah yes , i saw [ the tweet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wes6n.jpg ) . 
  what about all the other au tz corps out there ? 
  my alliance is full of them , as are many others . 
  are you dead set on fw or is nullsec small gang acceptable ? 
  hmm well if you base out of stacmon or similar , its easy to roam into syndicate . 
  let us know and i can arrange a fight or three . 
  if this just happened now , that explains why time dilation in lonetrek was at 10 % . 
  or a picture of a door . 
  i came for the spaceships , but i stay for the drama . 
  to be fair , it happened a lot more in the upper class , since they were the only ones with continual access to sugary food . 
  confirming that if i was n't already in a kick-ass alliance , i would join those guys . 
  they 're in there somewhere , 
  although if you want just the original score , you can check out the [ downloads ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/download/music/ ) . 
  most of the time , it 's quite empty . 
  when i lived in lowsec , we 'd have about ten in local , of which perhaps one or two were n't blue to us ( mostly , they were cyno alts ) . 
  occasionally , a bunch of neutrals ( usually from redvsblue ) would arrive , so we 'd reship and chase them around the surrounding systems , or crash into them and start exploding ships . 
  occasionally , a few hundred ncdot or ev0ke players would set up a staging point , so we 'd harass them while they were there ( i must have killed so many cyno ships , judging by the number of overpriced replacements i sold them ) . 
  the main difference between highsec and lowsec is that * you know * that either you 're hunting them or they 're hunting you . 
  in highsec , the wolves hide within the herd of sheep . 
  would you * also * prefer guns to always hit but just with ` reduced effectiveness ' ? 
  that makes just as little sense as for electronic warfare . 
   i think that 's how australian actors are so often able to infiltrate hollywood : they grew up hearing american and british accents in the media and got a feel for it from a young age . 
  not necessarily ; the australian accent is very easy to turn into other accents by ` crisping it up ' and ' [ speaking properly ] ( http://timstackpool.blogspot.com.au/2010/02/australian-accent-for-foreign-actors.html ) ' , which is a lot easier than the other way around . 
  most americans still retain their strong accent decades after moving to australia ; australians moving elsewhere usually pick up the accent of where they 're loving within a few years .

  i 'm not saying it 's a good fit , since i 've never used it , but it 's what you wanted . 
  just put them on public contracts then nopenopenope your way out of the area . 
  no , a sell contract . 
  sell it all , get isk , buy replacements later . 
  you only have to look at the leading actors of avatar , the mentalist and without a trace to see australians doing whichever accent they need for the role , 
  yes , heavy missiles have been nerfed . 
  it 's mostly range though .

  welcome to the unbearable lightness of upvotes that is life . 
  do all the tutorials . 
  read the [ eve university wiki ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/main_page ) . 
  never fly what you ca n't afford to lose . 
  even if a new mmo doesnt suck , these days people just go ` ill just wait until it goes f2p ' which is a real kick in the nuts for revenue . 
  unless you 're doing an escalation chain , you should be able to knock off most exploration sites in an hour or two . 
  if not , you can hand off the coords or get people in fleet to warp to you , then ask them to split the rewards if you have to go before it is finished . 
  alternatively , you can explore in low-sec , where the sites can all be done in a strategic cruiser .

  scordite is 228.49 isk/m ^ 3, 
  a max hulk is 25.77 m ^ 3/s = 5888 isk per second = 21.2 m isk/hour . 
  an orca ganglink style gives -32.3 % cycle time and +15 % yield , thus boosting a hulk to 36m isk per hour . 
  so , sixteen hours for each plex , assuming infinite rocks , 100 % efficiency , and ignoring the extra plex that the orca pilot needs,

  you could probably get a lot of mileage from mining the spod in sov null . 
  that rock is massive .
