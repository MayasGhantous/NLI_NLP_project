  i should message sindel about that . 
  sure you can do it in a t1 cruiser , but why not go with the easiest ship ? 
  \\* shrug \\* you were going to be training for something anyway , why not t3s ? 
  fit an ancillary current router . 
  problem solved . 
  a gtc splits into two plex , and is generally a bit cheaper ( $ 35 vs $ 19 for a single plex ) you can get them from any of the [ authorized resellers ] ( https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx ) . 
  ( personally , i like evetimecode.com since the ` lostineve ' discount code gives 5 % off ), 
  many of the $ 15 deals are only for starting new accounts , which is not really what you want . 
  when i were a lad , i lost quite a few ships in lowsec , and narrowly avoided quite a few more ( including an unintentionally-neut-proof shield myrm when i was attacked by a curse , oh what lols ) . 
  frankly , it was still more profitable and fun than highsec , so keep at it . 
  one radar site and you 'll have completely paid for your ship . 
  re [ tash-murkon prime ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/tash-murkon_prime/agents ) : you 'll probably be looking for [ tash-murkon family agents ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/npc/tash-murkon_family/agents ) . 
  every 16 normal missions will be a storyline mission , which will give standings towards the corp + faction . 
  re : jita . 
  scamming is not a bannable offense . 
  running bots that spam local is , however . 
  bounties : do n't worry about it . 
  people put bounties on each other for any old reason . 
  i 'd rather lose a trimark than not be able to neut people outside of 6km . 
  well , aint nobody else gon na clench it * for * you , son . 
   though i am leery of pouring something called cyanoacrylate on any of my open wounds . 
  that 's what it was * invented * for . 
  you 're probably flying an amarr ship , since you 're new , and deep in amarr space . 
  you might like to read up on their [ ship line ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/amarr_basic_ship_and_skill_guide ) . 
  there are links to articles on each particular ship . 
  anchor some cans . 
  get everyone in noob ships . 
  run a race . 
  tldr ; a bunch of fixes plus this . 
   ** user interface **, 
   the safety level setting is now persisted on the server per character and will be restored when logging on . 
  no , approach each can in turn , like yacht racing . 
  ok im going to stop handholding you now . 
  this is the worst article i have read on tmdc since the * last * article he wrote . 
  tldr ; americans either have a higher [ tolerance for fear ] ( http://economics.com.au/?p=9546 ) , or possibly a higher [ tolerance of liberty ] ( http://economics.com.au/?p=9551 ) , and foreigners [ find it hard ] ( http://economics.com.au/?p=9554 ) to decide which . 
  not if you like void, 
  ( you do ), 
  especially when salvage prices are [ going up ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/week-in-life-trips.html ) .

  then put your * alt * in the rp corp.

  mirrorgod wrote this , and i agree completely :, 
   i 'm open to believe that what was broken about logis was n't the fact that a corp/alliance could bring 10 guardians, 
   but that smaller/noobie alliances could n't, 
   with more proliferation of logis you 'll see another layer of tactics required, 
  the technical term is `` pay to not wait '' .

    do you agree that you can still philosophically be an anarchist while working inside the system to try and improve things now ? 
   yes , i still consider myself to be an anarchist . 
  or libertarian socialist like chomsky calls it . 
  for me it 's first and most a job . 
  i am not an anarchist because it 's the perfect political theory . 
  i am an anarchist because there is no such thing as the perfect political theory . 
  welcome to anarcho-capitalism , where business contracts are ultimately enforced by the threat of 1400mm artillery . 
  it 's time to lock and load cargo . 
  i admit to have attempted to tackle freighters in highsec :(, 
  under most circumstances you will be better off making them into rigs . 
  which rigs and what size ? 
  well , that 's what iskperhour and other similar apps will tell you . 
  i have a blueprint business ; it 's fairly profitable , mostly because the corp has a bpo library already , so members do n't have to recoup the outlay themselves . 
  even at the lower end , a copy job of 20x max-run hobgoblin blueprints takes maybe 3 days . 
  ten research slots = 200 bpcs @ 150k each = 10 million isk per day . 
  that 's still 8 million after fuel costs ( small tower ) and that 's copying the lowest of the low blueprints . 
  it 's a lot better when you 're making more exclusive stuff , or happen to have some mates sharing copy/research lines . 
  some things i have learned , or internalized rather than just understood intellectually , are, 
  * the importance of planning a few steps ahead ( next-level thinking ), 
  * being aware that input materials can change in price a lot , just because someone else is being a prick, 
  * the critical importance of knowing what is changing in the next patch , and applying next-level thinking to it . 
  one example : we knew that the new destroyers were being released , so we made sure we had enough stockpiled minerals at least a month before the patch . 
  then we identified which minerals are over-represented in those hulls , and bought extra , then sold it a few days before patch time when everyone else realised it . 
  meanwhile , we were furiously inventing light missile launchers and rockets ( we bought a lot of meta-level ones for the new players , but bittervets will go straight for tech 2 ) and other stuff that got a buff , like drone damage modules . 
  oh , and we arranged for a cyno chain from outer ring to empire for the venture bpos , but connection issues meant we lost the first mover advantage ( venture bpo sales are unsustainable anyway - the venture is nowhere near as universally-popular as the noctis was ), 
   yesterday it prevented me from shooting a guy who was about to shoot me in lowsec .
