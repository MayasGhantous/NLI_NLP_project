  buy them back , melt them down , and make them illegal . 
  we got rid of large-calibre handguns the same way . 
  it was expensive , but sometimes you got ta spend a little to buy a better society . 
  if only you lived in the usa that sent men to the moon , instead of the usa where everything is just too hard and should n't be tried . 
  til to judge things on how * easy * they are , rather than how * worthy * . 
  i wonder what she is trying to tell you .

  by law , companies in oz must set aside annual leave in a separate account so that even if they go bankrupt they can cover them . 
  i have you tagged as ` does not understand `` minimum '' ' . 
  retirement funds are different , and in oz are owned by each employee . 
  change jobs , keep same retirement plan . 
  our inequality ratio is a lot better though . 
  that figure for oz counts public holidays too , btw . 
  there wasnt a mining boom back when the laws were made though .

  if you wait until the 27th of december , you can pick up [ all the gifts ] ( http://www.eveonline.com/holiday/ ) when you activate hours 4 plex ...

  if you just want to use hours for plex , then after dec 27 and before jan 4 . 
  i 'd rather have my flight grounded , than to find out the plane was unsafe and lose my entire family in a plane crash . 
  what the hell is he doing putting bpos in his lab ? 
  bpos go in * station * , then scientific networking should be trained so they can be used in a lab . 
  if you 're that low on cash , use tachyon oracles and stay out of range of the pos modules . 
  push industries is great . 
  i just send them courier contracts . 
  try the missile turrets ; they 're delicious . 
  i would so fit this module . 
  theyve never needed to care before . 
  sounds like you should be doing self-education while at work , then . 
  ah , in many countries , non-competes face a reasonableness test . 
  past about 6 months , if they want you to not work in your field , they must pay you the salary that you 're missing because of the non-compete clause . 
  it is profoundly socialist , from an american viewpoint . 
  from a global viewpoint , it 's centrist , and moving to the right over the past decade . 
  are those companies gaining loyalty , or exploiting desperation ? 
  depends on your viewpoint , really . 
  unskilled labour and highly-skilled labour both charge by the hour . 
  it 's only the semi-skilled white collar work that stays on salary , chasing the elusive carrot of promotion . 
  the promise of a carrot , to go with the certainty of the stick . 
  american companies in australia often give out paid healthcare , in some sort of ` best of both worlds ' scenario . 
  i guess it makes sense , since giving free healthcare but taking away vacation days is a quick way to weed out all the smart candidates for your job vacancies . 
  god i wish reddit had enemies as well as friend lists , because youd be on it .

  i 'm a contract software developer . 
  i did my time as a permanent staff member ( 7 years or so ) , then i realised that my loyalty to the company was not going to be reciprocated . 
  people deserve loyalty ; corporations do not . 
  so , i looked around at contract positions over the next few months , looking for one that would suit me . 
  i saw one for 40 % more than my current salary and decided to go for it . 
  it has been a couple years now , and i 'm on my third contract , but it 's going quite well . 
  there 's no illusion of permanence to my employers , and the minimum 40 % i charge over what a permanent staff member costs pays for annual leave , downtime between contracts and whatever premium i set for risk . 
  i 'll probably settle down at a permanent position when i 'm in my 40 's , but in the mean time i get to see the best and worst that a succession of companies have to offer , learning how to deal with various situations and hopefully taking the best ideas from each gig and putting them into my professional toolbox for if the situation crops up in a future job .

  the rorqual is also really useful for refuelling pos towers , and jumping stuff around . 
  it can also carry a tower in its cargo hold so you can easily jump into a system and set up a tower along with a few mining ships .
