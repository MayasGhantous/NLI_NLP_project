  everyone installs a clone in the rorqual then chills in highsec until everything is set up . 
  no , no i do n't . 
  confirming your insanity . 
  at your skill level , the third bcs will do less for you than a nanofiber internal structure or overdrive to get in range sooner . 
  the range nerf is actually not a new issue for hams , which were already short range . 
  tactical strike is new . 
  no mindflood ? 
  even synth would have saved you ... 
  if you 're a newbie , just leave it in station until you need it , or if you 're really keen , repackage the ships and load them all into the industrial ship you received from the career agent missions . 
  that really depends on who set up the market orders , does n't it ? 
  oh , i thought you wanted accurate answers . 
  in that case , refinery efficiency iii and ore-specific refining skill iii . 
  message me if you want manufacturing tips . 
  i do a fair bit of that kind of thing . 
  worth reading . 
  incursions . 
  it will be rough until they get into t2 ships so you will likely have to run lots of t1 logi , but it will get you flying together in semi pvp fits while earning money . 
  safeties to amber , then . 
  i 've been to the pilbara . 
  it is literally too hot for grass . 
  for a newbie : radar sites i believe . 
  you can trade gtcs fine , but trading plex for out of game stuff is a good way to get permabanned . 
  good thing you did n't post on somewhere popular like reddit then . 
  sending stuff from australia is not a problem . 
  perhaps we can set up some sort of steam games for food export business . 
  so , more like breaking bad news . 
  tried creating both fits in eft then applying the reps from the logistics ship onto the other one ? 
  evidently nobody gets that joke . 
  do chores for your brother , he pays you with game time . 
  isnt that updated each downtime ? 
  he 's already been rejected from dreddit . 
  the major difference between other mmos and eve is that you do n't suddenly become the hero just because you paid your subscription fee . 
  eve at least has the rl exploits of nullsec alliances as an alternative to the static mission arcs of empire pve , but whether it 's killing dragan for the 100 000th time , or interdicting gallente ice fields , it 's a glaring flaw in the sand box that the npc factions do not react beyond the most miniscule , fine-grained standings changes to the actions of the * actual * live actors of eve : the players . 
  nice try , aiden . 
  i remember mark hamill . 
  also recognising one of the actors as a porn star . 
  i name all my characters by different ways to not tell the truth . 
  creddit would be an industrial and trading corp though . 
  broke credditors . 
  i believe subdreddit is a thing now . 
  tbh i do n't care what it 's called , as long as you choose a [ viable system ] ( http://evesp.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/how-lowsec-became-viable.html ) to base from . 
  try failheap , then . 
  [ fine then ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ), 
  i like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ) , myself . 
  link 404s now . 
  gf gf . 
  xylitol is pretty good for dental health though . 
  i like drone interfacing v for the carrier prereq . 
  this is fairly bad advice if the gate is bubbled competently . 
  personally , i wouldnt respec for drones at all . 
  theyre about the same ( adequate ) speed with int/mem and per/will so its not really worth spending a remap on . 
  civilian ancillary bucket booster , even . 
  it 's not terrible but it 's not particularly good in many ways . 
  hit up [ fail heap ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?9780-pvp-dragoon ) . 
  probably delivering rifters to own alliance . 
  thats a fair bit of investigatiin there . 
  it also explains how imperial 0rder kept throwing isk around while being actively terrible at eve . 
  * [ eve uni ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/main_page ), 
  * [ project halibut ] ( http://projecthalibut.org/about/ ), 
  kestrel , corax , caracal , drake , raven maybe . 
  long rang missiles for pve and short ranged for pvp . 
  those are the missile line ; blasters have their own separate ships . 
  if you go cloaky youll likely be using a manticore and falcon . 
  i 'd tell you , but i wo n't do it pro bono . 
  eve uni wiki already has an article about 51 day alt miners . 
  interestingly , navy launchers have 14 % more dps than meta 4 , so if you never use t2 ammo it 's still better than tech 2 , even with max skills . 
  sadly , faction turrets are worse than t2 :(, 
  some call it ` blue intel ' . 
  others call it ` creating compelling game content for other people ' . 
  no , mostly it was the germans shooting at them that kept them fighting . 
  still , easier to make isk in a non pimp incursion fleet than level 4 missions . 
  too soon . 
  if he 's a friend of yours , he should send you a free month 's subscription . 
  after all , he gets it back .

  * everyone * is more likely to be extorted by a police officer . 
  australia has something * [ slightly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minerals_resource_rent_tax ) * similar , which kicks in at $ bond_rate + 7 % :, 
   the minerals resource rent tax ( mrrt ) is a tax on profits generated from the exploitation of non-renewable resources in australia . 
  one can take the position that profiteering over the bodies of american soldiers is far worse than profiteering over mountains with high rust content . 
  do n't be a tease . 
   a former assistant prosecutor and onetime executive director of the state parole board , mcgreevey describes himself as `` wed to the status quo '' of corrections until he took a turn at jailhouse ministering as an academic requirement of his episcopal seminary training . 
  doing it right . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/15ows1/new_player_seeking_advice/c7ofy00 ) . 
  not if you squander it . 
  military experts are calling this a falungongisaural field . 
  is your corporation at war or something ? 
  which one are you in ? 
  i recommend you hold off on using those skill points for the time being . 
  ccp does n't exactly hand them out like candy . 
  i also recommend taking tiinpa 's advice and immediately training destroyer and battlecruiser skills ( along with the minimum frigate and cruiser skills of a couple of racial types ) . 
  once all the ccp devs get back from vacation , things are going to get * hectic * . 
  i think eve uni would be a great help to you . 
  do n't be afraid to ask for advice in their public channel even if you have n't been accepted yet . 
  no big surprise .
