  mvn wasnt always in - a - though . 
  - rep , nerd bragging alert, 
  if i had a windows install on my mac i 'd play even less eve and a lot more < other games i have on steam but do n't have mac ports  . 
  are there reps for the intaki syndicate ? 
  test and gsf worry more about their players switching games than fail cascading . 
  shield upgrades v is quite good . 
  why do you need a character with 15m sp if you 're going for industry ? 
  most of the industry characters i see for sale are way more sp for way more isk , and below 15m sp it 's easier to pick up a [ power of two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/14tsf1/psa_power_of_two_is_back/ ) account instead . 
  yes , then can scan you except in these circumstances :, 
  * you are flying a tech 2 blockade runner transport ( items will still drop when they pop you ), 
  * when you put stuff in a container then courier contract it , or if it wo n't fit in a container you can courier-wrap it twice ( called [ double-wrapping ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/hauling_101#advanced_hauling_topics ) ) , scanners can only see the container ( but will suspect that it is full of juicy stuff and may pop you to find out ), 
  ha , they 're secure because they can be locked , not because they ca n't be x-rayed or stolen . 
  i believe any audit or secure container can not be repacked for ~ 30 days if there was stuff in its audit logs . 
  * constellation gate recorders should be hackable to disable them for a while, 
  * it would be awesome for gate recorders to be read from corp api , with timeouts based on sov level ( level 1 = once per 24 hours , sov 5 = more often ), 
  * directional scanner results should be added to system iff beacon results . 
  once one person scans someone , everyone who is not red to the iff beacon should get that intel . 
  * d-scan should be automated , even if it 's less often than manually bashing it . 
  * it would be awesome if d-scans also got saved in fleet , as a sort of distributed iff beacon of everything that 's in scan range of someone . 
  depending on sig radius , could be 25 + . 
  xr terrible posting while unsubbed . 
  eve does . 
  people have been playing tribes games since quake was the new hotness . 
  expect to be schooled quite comprehensively by those players . 
  considering pathfinder devs have stated that their intention is to create eve 's sandbox play style using the familiar setting of swords and sorcery , it 's pretty obvious there will be a large amount of ` borrowing ' of game mechanics . 
  eve has nothing to fear from pfo , but other fantasy mmos might have more to worry about . 
  perhaps the ports that eve uses are blocked by your isp . 
  ccp has had problems in the past with isps thinking its traffic is file-sharing . 
  try a few of these options and see if they work :, 
  * follow [ these steps ] ( http://support.eveonline.com/pages/kb/article.aspx?id=119 ) ( especially the traceroute bit ), 
  * [ change port ] ( http://support.eveonline.com/pages/kb/article.aspx?id=405 ), 
  this started days ago !, 
  slowest . 
  ever [ . 
  clear your eve cache and try again . 
  if that does n't help , you 'll probably have to raise a petition with customer support . 
  honestly ? 
  nobody knows for sure , although i am certain that you will not lose skill points during the changeover ( you may not get 4x the sp of incompletely trained battlecruisers v , but you will get something ), 
  most major shipping services do this , but sometimes you and 15 of your friends get bored and decide to try your luck ... 
  100mb/s is * fine * . 
  i dont know about you , but ill be putting hams and neuts on mine . 
  they 're called corp buy orders . 
  [ repost ] ( / r/eve/comments / 167d7n/retribution _ point_release_combat_battlecruisers / ) . 
  for those who have n't been following , there 's been quite a lot said about nullsec industry . 
  themittani.com has a few articles ( well worth reading ), 
  * [ the ` vision ' thing ] ( http://themittani.com/features/vision-thing ), 
  ** tldr ; ** nullsec should be about empires and should be more desirable than highsec, 
  * [ creation and destruction ] ( http://themittani.com/features/creation-and-destruction ), 
  ** tldr ; ** people should * live * in nullsec , working farms and fields for ` us ' to set fire to, 
  * [ destroying shipyards ] ( http://themittani.com/features/destroying-shipyards ), 
  ** tldr ; ** it 's hard to set fire to stuff when everything is jumpfreighted from jita , and this is bad . 
  * [ addressing the tritanium problem ] ( http://themittani.com/features/addressing-tritanium-problem ), 
  ** tldr ; ** nobody wants to mine trit in null , so obviously we need super-veldspar . 
  cautionary analysis also exists :, 
  * [ the farms and fields misdirection ] ( http://fiddlersedge.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/the-farms-and-fields-misdirection.html ), 
  ** tldr ; ** if you think industrialists want to move to null and risk their farms and fields without better ways to protect them than now , you 're gon na have a bad time, 
  * [ a question of labor ] ( http://www.fiddlersedge.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/farms-and-fields-question-of-labor.html ), 
  ** tldr ; ** mining low-ends in null is n't economically feasible ( from risk , , outlay , labor or even isk-per-hour ) and superveld wo n't fix this . 
  what 's wrong with buying from highsec miners anyway ? 
  and of course a few people chiming in like this guy , a summary of which is, 
  ** tldr ; ** if you want more manufacturing in null , do n't make super-veldspar , ** make normal trit 10 times smaller ** , so it 's better to ship it from jita and build in null than bring down entire ships . 
  also , make t1 stuff build slower so a single industrialist ca n't supply the entire alliance .

   please send isk if you find this useful !, 
  have you considered moving to australia ? 
  my dad trains loco engineers for bhp in western australia , and those guys are on ~ 140k/year . 
  ha , no i do n't work for bhp . 
  but the pay is real . 
  you ca n't even get good coffee in half the country because who wants to wait tables for minimum wage when they can go to a mining town and make bank ? 
  have you considered using a tool like [ drk ] ( http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com ) to track these jobs ? 
  i make capital ships . 
  yeah it 's pretty neat to have an industrial pos or two . 
  for capital ship * production * , all you need is a station in lowsec though . 
  [ some pvp guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) for new players, 
  tldr ; pick some [ high volume pvp items ] ( http://k162space.com/2012/11/02/high-volume-pvp-items/ ) , fly to somewhere out of the way like agil , then seed the market . 
  well , a few billion worth of blueprints as well . 
  rigs , especially small rigs , can be profitable with me 0 . 
  you have just described super-veldspar , 
  the problem with super-veldspar is that nullsec does n't really have a shortage of low-ends : it has a shortage of people willing to mine low-ends ( in fact , they have a chronic shortage of people in general ) . 
  if you seed super-veldspar , they 'll still mine ` just enough ' to handle their immediate needs , because there 's a lot more interesting and rewarding things they could be doing in null . 
  compare that to highsec , where veldspar is a great choice of something to mine , and heaps of people actively seek out low-ends . 
  this enables a legitimate balance of trade between nullsec and highsec . 
  players in each region are doing what they enjoy , rather than highsec player feeling useless compared to the trit romneys of nullsec , who are less bitter but still overworked trying to supply the mineral needs for an entire alliance . 
  the idea about making trit smaller in size is because at present , you physically can not bring enough low-ends by volume into nullsec to feed its markets . 
  by making it easier to transport minerals , you make it more attractive to make stuff in null instead of transport the finished ships down instead . 
  my eve online habit has paid off ; i now work with spreadsheets all day . 
  hit up the syndicate thread on failheap and they 'll be sure to ambush you en route . 
  people do it all the time , whether immigrating or just on a work visa , 
  ha yeah i noted the lossmail on my killboard . 
  that guy is big on experimental fittings . 
  oh , i can provide [ house music ] ( http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn407/milkohol/videogifs/house-boombox.gif ) .

  light switches are for lights . 
  power switches are for power sockets , when you want to turn something off at the wall but do n't want the hassle of pulling the plug . 
  i do n't know about you guys , but australian 3-pin plugs are quite secure and hard to pull out .
