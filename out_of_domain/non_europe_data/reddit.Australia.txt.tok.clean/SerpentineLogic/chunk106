   responsibilities :, 
   * using an in-house 3d engine to compose , frame and capture video game screenshots , that `` capture the moment '' and tell a story in a single panel,

  ccp has a machinima app called jessica that uses high-res eve textures plus extras . 
  i hear it 's powered by icelandic elves and powdered lens flares , but nobody knows for certain . 
  you know what is a great way to get over the fear ? 
  not caring about losing the ship . 
  get in a corp with a reimbursement policy , or faction warfare where isk rains from the upside down triangles , and you 'll never worry about losing a fight again . 
  mate , your terms of acceptance of that beta key mean you ca n't sell it . 
  probably sony places ? 
  sig radius should always matter :(, 
  that does n't sound very useful . 
  while it 's probably annoying in australia if you have arthritis and have problems pulling the plug out , it 's equally annoying if you 're vacuuming or ironing and accidentally unplug yourself . 
  does n't matter . 
  it does n't belong to you ; it belongs to ccp . 
  you ca n't sell , only give it away .

  but everything he has ever posted has been in the test build at the time . 
  you do n't know anyone you could borrow a ps3 from ? 
  dreddit didnt want you .

  i set up google docs to use ` isk ' , because it allows it . 
  thats not a proposal , thats a throwaway line . 
  peace in our time .

  faction warfare alliances drop capitals a lot more often these days . 
  at least 10 % of the spinal unit patients in my local hospital are attempted suicide cases . 
  oh , * charmed * , or as my wife calls it , ` the booby show ' . 
  being a train driver is n't much fun either .

  well we cant all afford capital bpos , so we started a corp , 
  and posting here achieves what , exactly ?
