  i will also make the attempt to increase the communication between the csm and you , the players with regular reports and posts right here on this forum . 
  i will not hide these communications away on a blog , they will be here , on record , where you can respond to them . 
   ** what is my philosophy **, 
   i believe in eve . 
  i think it 's something special in the gaming world , and i think that what makes eve special is worth protected and supporting . 
  i believe in the freedom of players to interect with each other , and the right of players to determine how those interactions result with the minimum of npc interference . 
  i believe in making changes to eve that increase the possibilities of player ineraction , and that provide gameplay opportunities . 
  if you send me to reykjavik , you will be sending a message to ccp that you want that emergent , player-driven narrative to be the core and centre of eve . 
   if you like , you can get a [ more ] ( http://themittani.com/features/xnym-or-everybody-needs-somebody ), 
   [ detailed ] ( http://themittani.com/features/eve-real-not-real ) idea, 
   [ of my ] ( http://themittani.com/features/gold-rush ), 
   [ thoughts ] ( http://themittani.com/features/outsider-one-players-perspective-goons ) about eve on the articles i have written for themittani.com . 
  please note that i am completely unaffilated with the cfc , and there is no specific goon input into my campaign , nor will there be in my actions as a csm . 
   i also wrote a [ hi-sec manifesto ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=26049 ) in this forum , which specifically laid out my thoughts on hi-sec . 
  i think it also showcases my general philosophy on eve . 
   ** what 's your alignment ? 
   my election campaign has no official standing in any eve coaltion . 
  i am a member of the initiative. , which is currently in the hbc , but i have not sought permission or asked support from anyone in the hbc to run for election . 
  i believe the hbc will run their own `` official '' candidate . 
   enough about me : ask questions . 
  soil carbon sequestration is a thing , you know . 
  sequester carbon in soil, 
  actually nope , sequestered soil carbon is more like activated charcoal . 
  [ instead of decomposing ] ( http://www.csiro.au/en/outcomes/environment/australian-landscapes/soil-carbon.aspx ) , it acts as a shelter for microbial nitrogen-fixers . 
  this is true . 
  i quit after 21 days . 
  five times . 
  the sixth account stuck :p, 
  i did . 
  the best idea would be to not sequester c02 , but to sequester via a [ biochar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biochar ) process , preferably by using stuff like corn cobs and sugarcane mulch that costs money to dispose of . 
  csm 8 : good posting, 
  in the finest reddit tradition , lolnope . 
  csm impeachment process . 
  why did n't you get your shit together and propose one or two fully-fleshed out proposals instead of arguing in iceland instead of over skype ? 
  its not as if you were waiting on ccp - it was csm that didnt deliver on that session . 
  this goes for the csm election topic too , where at least trebor had something to push . 
  modular starbases are ' a thing ' with me . 
  i saw a great example of tying them into a theme on failheap . 
  the ** theme ** was ` intel and surveillance ' . 
  the ** idea ** was that you can anchor watchtowers that will log the comings and goings of players that turn up on grid with it . 
  the watchtowers will be anchorable anywhere ( * ) , which ties into the pos rework . 
  the intel would be spooled out via crest , which ties in that aspect . 
  the intel could also be seen when someone found them on d-scan ( ` last seen 24 hours ago in hed-gp in drake ' ) , which ties in d-scan intel improvements . 
  this intel could also be sold to someone who has a ` surveillance contract ' on that player , which would be like a bounty but instead of killmails you get player-generated locator results . 
  this ties into the demand side of intel by reusing some of the same concepts of retribution . 
  is this the kind of ` hook ' that ccp is looking for ? 
  \\* cough \\* sadistica \\* cough \\*, 
  believe me , not all npc null is broken truesec . 
  he 's an achiever in the [ bartle model ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bartle_test ) . 
  it 's just how he is vov . 
  you dont get killmails , but you do see the delicious damage notifications scroll past when you nuke someone from orbit . 
  i 'm afk cloaking until jester and malcanis burn out , ha, 
  it 's too hot for grass to grow up there :(, 
  `` but it 's a dry heat '', 
  socioeconomic factors , mate . 
  there are other pockets , you know . 
  i would love to deploy one of those in my home system . 
  it 's on the test server : sarmatiko [ found it ] ( https://twitter.com/myronik/status/292387686524792832 ) . 
  btw looks like those pirate faction rookie ships are there as well ... 
  possibly mission locations . 
  ccp said theyre trying to move away from rightclicking in space to get warp ins . 
  on , or before february 12th , i would guess . 
  it 's only a matter of time before people post screenshots of the ` swastika route ' , or more likely ` destination : penis ' . 
  the stars are on top of the prerendered nebula . 
  mate , killboard stats are a thing ... 
  just close ones . 
  battlecruisers to v. do it now . 
  drama . 
  a myrmidon should do level 3 missions fairly easily , provided you have t2 drones and drone interfacing iv . 
  you could also use a gila if you like drones + missiles . 
  level 4 missions probably require a dominix ( or rattlesnake if you want mkssiles ) though . 
  they can be done in a battlecruiser but it takes too long to do compared to blitzing level 3 missions . 
  it does n't compare to * come to daddy * though . 
  tier 3 , and also because of the skill change in february . 
  too long . 
  i 'm [ not joking ] ( https://twitter.com/myronik/status/292385289387790336 ) . 
  you have 24 days ... 
  the traditional way is to post a screenshot of your hangar full of exploration loot :-), 
  you must not get many battles with so many blues . 
  it 's probably just a ruse to flush out spies , 
  east khanid trading . 
  and by that , i mean that corp does mining operations in khanid and you could join them or have your corp join their alliance . 
  to be fair , they were negotiating down from '80 hours a week , plus we pay you in scrip that you can only redeem at the company store ' . 
  so , quit your job and start consulting . 
  you 'll get that rush back quite quickly , 
  failheap is good . 
  phoneposting ~, 
  my < type  shield compensation backbone ;(, 
  forever alone . 
  if i feel a bit burnt out from eve , what i do is this :, 
  set up some long industry jobs ( make some freighter bpcs , or whatever ), 
  do n't login for a month . 
  so , win-win . 
  ( cobbled together from eve and dust trailers , because of nda ), 
  wonder if they 'll do preference deals with julian assange . 
  they should call it `` free pirate sex party '', 
  timbers status : shivered . 
  actually , we had a [ bit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joh_bjelke-petersen#rise_to_power ) of gerrymandering in australia , and that has been pr since federation .
