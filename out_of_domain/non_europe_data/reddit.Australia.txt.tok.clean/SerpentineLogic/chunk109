  6 launcher tengus are quite cap unstable , so its good to be able to turn off one booster if you dont need it . 
  also small deadspace boosters are generally a lot cheaper than mediums . 
  my 5-launcher fit can run stable with an lsb , which makes it quite easy-mode , 
  bonus points for using fof missiles so you do n't even need to target stuff . 
  not very . 
  its mostly for elite cruisers and frigs that get close . 
  yes , rigors work . 
  sounds like a great way to spend a * friday * . 
  meh , its only one slot . 
  incoming repswont be affected much . 
  catch up ? 
  * nobody * will have the skill , so who would you be catching up to ? 
  so , get it to iv then move on ? 
  that argument is something that can be applied to any skill that does n't open up an entirely new class of ship , and even then , older players will have better support skills ... 
  there 's a few ways , but the easiest is :, 
  1 . go into jobs, 
  1 . select corporation from the dropdown on the top right, 
  1 . click on each job and it will tell you at the bottom of the window where it is installed ( and which hangar division ), 
  compile a list of which labs are being used, 
  unanchor everything else ~ ~ and sell it in jita ~ ~ . 
  prowlers are great for clutch probe launchers too , 
  \\* pfft \\*, 
  still fresh . 
  goldberg , spielberg , iceberg , what 's the difference ? 
  you might want to update op :, 
    i may have goofed with the maths , but the nanobot overcharger rigs look distinctly underwhelming . 
  on an unrigged ship , heating a rep increases your hp/second by 29 % ( 1.1 x rep amount/0 .85 x cycle time ) . 
  with an no , that goes up to a 40 % increase on heating ( 1.13 x rep amount/0 .805 x cycle time ) . 
  unless i 've done the maths wrong , that means there 's never a situation where the no is better than an auxiliary nano pump outside of potential edge cases where you 're running into massive stacking penalties ( triple nano pumps ? 
  does anyone do this ? 
    unheated rep , no rigs : 1x rep amount, 
    unheated rep + heat rig : 1x rep amount, 
    unheated + auxiliary nano pump i : 1.15 x rep amount, 
    heated rep , no rigs : 1.29 x rep amount, 
    heated rep + heat rig : 1.4 x rep amount, 
    heated rep + auxiliary nano pump i : 1.48 x rep amount ( 1.29 x rep amount for heat times 1.15 x rep amount for the nano pump ), 
   your math is correct , my math was wrong . 
  i had been approximating the rigs in our internal test server using stat changed modules and had gotten the math wrong on the bonus . 
  to hit the benefits i was aiming for , the rig will double the heat bonus at tech one . 
   that 's what i get for posting before all the authoring challenges are worked out , but thanks for catching it now instead of someone having to catch it later . 
   i 've updated the op :, 
   ** armor rigs ** * updated formerly incorrect bonus on the overcharger . 
   * new rig called the nanobot overcharger that increased the overheat bonus on your local armor reps by ** 100 % ** ( ** 120 % ** for t2 ) . 
  so with one of the t1 rigs overheating gives the rep 20 % more rep amount and 30 % faster rate of fire instead of the default 10 % and 15 % respectively . 
  this effect is stacking penalized and gives no bonus when the reps are not overheated . 
  same calibration and build costs as a aux nano or nanobot acc rig . 
  i would n't go over ~ 50m . 
  after all , a couple of * catalysts * could pop that . 
  even some of the ` passive ' proteus fits squeeze in a sar . 
  check whether your passive sp is working ( stop and restart it just to be sure ), 
  if you play a lot of games , your sp will be capped at ~ 50 for a while .

  not 100 % sure ( have n't logged in for ~ a while ~ ) but there should be a ticker with your current skill point total , and it should go up as you watch it .

  well , a look at the killboard shows it was worth four or five times what a gank tornado costs . 
  yes , heaps . 
  in the cfc , c0nvicted also has a ton of aussies . 
  you should never have anything in a conquerable station that you cant afford to lose , anyway . 
  you have to run around the outside of your house with no pants on . 
  tell that to the dusties who were paid ridiculous sums of money to help flip the last few caldari systems . 
  money paid in contracts piles up in a corp wallet that is n't accessible in dust . 
  it still gets paid though . 
  realistically , either scout in a shuttle , or just fit four warp core stabs and refit in a low-sec station once you get past the camp . 
  something like this should do the trick :,
