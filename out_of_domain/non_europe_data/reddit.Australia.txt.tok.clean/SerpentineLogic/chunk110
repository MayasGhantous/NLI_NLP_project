  it does n't help all that much . 
  perhaps a rapid light missile launcher would be better . 
  the cap booster is there to keep your cap up if you have low skills , since it 's assumed that you 'll dock up or move your loot to highsec from time to time and can replace ammo and booster charges there . 
  you can replace it with a cap recharger if you prefer . 
  `` you 're either with us , or against us . '', 
  -- george `` montolio '' bush, 
  it 's useful but not a requirement for low-sec , especially if you 're not particularly interested in chasing other people around the place . 
  in nullsec it is mandatory , since you may need to get out of range of a warp disruption field during combat . 
  dominix , maybe the moa , the rest would be ok with better textures . 
   resist bonuses on t1 ships are a bit op, 
  i wonder what would happen if the resist bonus was changed to +7.5 % more hp per level instead ... 
   new skills are fine !, 
  new skills do n't do * that * much . 
  training to iii will be fine for newbies . 
   ganglinks are being nerfed , but not yet, 
  as they said in the minutes , as soon as masterplan and his team of merry optimisers can do on-grid boosting without causing massive server load spikes every time people warp , then they 'll do it . 
   the overheating rig was nixed because it was n't effective enough . 
  more likely ` too ineffective ' , then boosted to ` too effective ' , then removed for being ` too inelegant ' . 
  i 'm willing to wait for that . 
  there 's more important things that can be fixed first [ . 
  mixed guns ? 
  why not switch crystals instead ? 
  it is much more suited to pve than pvp , hence the cloak . 
  generally , the only activity that a pvp ship can engage in without needing any fitting changes is belt ratting , or cosmic anomalies ( preferably with someone else repairing them ), 
  you should be ok . 
  if you 're worried , take off another dda for an eanm , and fit a tracking disruptor or two instead of the exploration mid slots . 
  that should cut down the damage you take , while also keeping your drones alive by generating more threat . 
  try something like this :, 
  imperial navy heat sink,

  heat sink ii, 
  large ` accommodation ' vestment reconstructer i, 
  armor thermic hardener ii, 
  tracking enhancer ii,

  large capacitor control circuit i, 
  kill anything within 60km . 
  actually , the aec is only mandatory for federal elections . 
  each state ( and , i think each local government ) may elect to use the aec for their state elections , or go it alone via another provider , e.g. 
  [ these guys ] ( http://www.myvote.com.au/ ) . 
  not everyone trains drone skills to v , and besides , what else are you going to put there . 
  ancient grudges best grudges . 
  you can adjust the script of any tracking computers to improve tracking , but generally cruisers should die before they get close , leaving only frigates to be cleaned up by drones .

  that is the biggest `` fuck you , dominion '' i have ever seen . 
  the cynic in me says that the entire reason that this block war is happening is to prevent interruption of technetium income , which of course would be the first thing both sides would go after . 
  both mittens and shadoo have been around long enough to realise that , while dominion sov is a pain in the ass , it 's still better than the previous systems they had . 
  the ` oh dominion sov sucks ' line is a cop-out . 
  ** tldr ; ** ancillary armor repper to use nanite paste instead of cap boosters , most battlecruisers rejigged to get a utility high slot again , cyclone powergrid given a light kick in the nuts . 
  7 weapons * 1.25 = 8.76, 
  6 weapons * 1.5 = 9 plus a utility high ... 
  is n't that why we 're on reddit ? 
  daily . 
  note that your agent will still research even if you do n't run them . 
  eve has a finite topology , so resources are never safe from competition and you will be forced to interact with others at some stage ( unless your aim is to never buy or sell anything , this is impossible to avoid anyway ), 
  as far as exploration goes , there are many hidden sites throughout the new eden cluster that can only be pinpointed by scanning them down with probes . 
  the move about , as well , so it 's a constant search for the next site . 
  in addition , wormholes can be probed down that could send you anywhere ( * ) in the cluster , or even into wormhole-space , which obeys different rules to knownspace . 
  about 9 % of eve players hang out in w-space , so you may find the remoteness to be suited to you . 
  if not , there 's small pockets of high-sec surrounded by low-sec space that are relatively unpopulated . 
  these high-sec islands are pretty laid-back to do industry or whatever it is you like to do . 
  if you were in a player corporation , you could tag along on level 4 missions , and your corpmate could share the standings boost when you complete them . 
  doing that , and training social and connections skills a few levels should catapult you into level 2 or 3 missions fairly quickly . 
  of course , that presupposes you can handle level 3 missions ... 
  probably nerfing their bonuses while also making them easier to fit . 
  tech 1 ships wo n't be bonused for links . 
  it 's more about nerfing the compounding bonuses of t2 links + ship + skills * multiple links . 
  if you [ run the numbers ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/tag/command-ships/ ) , they get quite big . 
  welp . 
  actually , i misread that . 
  data centres can only be used once per character . 
  bubbles are equal-opportunity disruptors . 
  only aussies are allowed to use mate unironically . 
  ** tldr ; **, 
  fc makes a fleet composition with suggested fits/doctrine and ratios required, 
  other people can see which fits they can fly and which skills they 're missing, 
  fc posts an op with date and doctrine to fly, 
  other people mark themselves as attending , and with which ship, 
  shopping lists can be made from lossmails or manually,

  i ca n't take credit ; it 's written by [ wacktopia ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/wacktopia ) of [ noir . 
  ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/corporation/noir._ ) , so as long as your corp is n't actively hostile to black legion you should be ok . after all , you can get a fair bit of this sort of intel already from doing data analysis on killboards , so it 's not really as much of a secret as you 'd think . 
   i saw it was something like $ 30 for 1 plex ( 30 days right ? ), 
  actually , it 's ~ $ 35 for a 60-day time card , which can be redeemed for two plex . 
  unless you do massive amounts of carebearing or station trading , probably 2-3 months before you can pay your way . 
  even then , it 's likely that you 'll get tired of expending your * entire * wallet each month to buy a plex , so realistically you 'll pay for 6 months in the first year . 
  after a certain point , it 's just easier to mow lawns for your subscription ... 
  as if eve-kill data mining did n't exist already ~, 
  well , they do n't have much choice ,
