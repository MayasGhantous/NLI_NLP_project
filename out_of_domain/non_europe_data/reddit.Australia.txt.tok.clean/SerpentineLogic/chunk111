  also , nobody like charles and camilla much . 
  now kiss . 
  better sounds , apparently . 
  then again , all those accounts are paying at least $ 11 per month to ccp . 
  heaven knows how many dust characters are needed to earn the same amount . 
  feel free , 
  / spacetyrant, 
  yes you can . 
  i believe the minmatar ships are best at this , since they are more agile . 
  agility matters when you 're piloting a gigantic freighter . 
  judging by recent reports , it 's because `` grinding sov is hard work '' . 
  just use drk industry tracker . 
  petition . 
  ccp can remove accounts , but it does have backups . 
  try any corp in sadistica alliance . 
  not sure . 
  it would help if you knew the credit card number you used to pay the subscription though . 
  you might also want to check out [ what has changed since then ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  mate youll love eve , then . 
  which other game has an internet browser built in ? 
  well , mabrick seems to do okay . 
  tldr ; nanites and jovians . 
  mwds also work for burning out of bubbles , even if youre in a gank brutix that can only operate in scram range . 
  `` military stations are calling this an expert '', 
  / r/fweddit, 
  i wonder . 
  i used to think that mattered , but it 's a very rare situation where the difference in cargoholds means less trips . 
  what , a man cant have a hobby ? 
  can you show the skills at zero anyway ? 
  i would love this for / r/eve as well . 
  essentially , yes . 
  modules can be repaired in station or by using nanite repair paste . 
  if yourmodule burns out or is being repaired , it cant be used until fixed . 
  you can do it in station - it 's much easier . 
  that 's not exactly a trial if you have to pay money , is it ? 
  bad articles from there still get down voted though . 
  dont autopilot freighters unless youre ok with your journey taking half an hour extra . 
  autopilot drops you 15km from each gate , which takes forever to cover at 85m/s . 
  what could possibly go wrong . 
  you have learned two very important life lessons . 
  do n't blindly trust other people with your money, 
  grinding for more money is pointless . 
  it 's how you spend it that makes you happy . 
  so , incursions . 
  the other games i play provide more immediate gratification but less long-term appeal . 
  * team fortress, 
  * faster than light, 
  * rebuild and other android games, 
  * lately , dust 514, 
  my wife . 
  thats a * very * personal question to ask someone . 
  have you identified weekly cycles in any of your items ? 
  yes there is , assuming its worth paying 15 bucks a month for . 
  if you want to get into cap building , message me . 
  i have enough in-game money to pay for the next year 's play time , and i 'm not especially wealthy by eve standards . 
  yes , i did the sums [ a while back ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/freighter-pilot-implants/ ) . 
  the usa pioneered representative democracy and the world owes you their gratitude . 
  having said that , we 've made some improvements since 1788 that you might like to merge back to trunk , so to speak . 
  sounds like the redistricting is n't the problem ; it 's the endemic corruption . 
   realize that at the very top ranks the gop is only about one thing : power . 
  fyp, 
  well , aura for eve is a good android app but if you want to change skills youll need to remote desktop into your home pc using your phone . 
  splashtop is a very popular rdp app , maybe that will suit . 
  2b wo n't buy you a dreadnaught ... 
  it did n't work - relogged a few times , then went to bed ha . 
  also , you pay even more tax if you 're over 30 and do n't have private health insurance ... 
  i like [ elegant backgrounds . 
  ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/wallpapers/01/01_1024.jpg ), 
  generally that stating money is best spent on some +3 implants and useful skill books , btw . 
  get a 21-day trial from someone in the 21-day thread, 
  buy a 60-day game time card from an eve gtc reseller such as evetimecode.com ( discount coupons may be available if you google it ), 
  in the eve client , [ redeem ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/30_day_pilot's_license_extension#how_to_create_them_from_an_etc ) the code into two plex, 
  do not undock with them, 
  rightclick to apply a plex to your account , which adds 30 days to your trial ( you now have 51 days ), 
  save the other for now, 
  receive gifts from your trial buddy, 
  1 . buy and train the cybernetics skill to i, 
  1 . buy and implant a set of +3 basic attribute enhancers, 
  1 . do all the tutorials, 
  have you read isk : the guide yet ?

  about $ 32000 if you used real-life money to replace the losses . 
  people sometimes logoff to avoid losing their ship .
