  however , this works less often than you 'd think , because the unpiloted ships can be scanned down with probes then pounced on anyway . 
  i found that it was close to impossible to mine enough for an industry alt 's needs . 
  having said that , once you submit your ten manufacturing jobs , what else are you going to do for the rest of the day ? 
  might as well mine . 
  sure . 
  patch speculation . 
  think of it not as losing a great pvper , but gaining a dev who is a great pvper . 
  a good , trusting corp ? 
  what an oxymoron . 
  i hear test loves goats . 
  in many senses of the phrase . 
  awesome alliance tournament coverage too . 
  database magic . 
  sounds ominous .

  i would bet 100m isk that he will be the one doing the battleship rebalancing , with fozzie advising him . 
  it will be fairly straightforward to do , and frankly fozzie needs another person to help or he wo n't be finished until 2015 . 
  i hope your tablet has fire insurance , then . 
  wait until you discover the ship spinning counter . 
  its entirely possible they will rip out the code and replace it with code from dust 514 ... 
  upvote for seth godin reference . 
  sons of alexander is full of kiwis . 
  does that count ? 
  yes , because military hospitals are known for bending rules . 
  well , many cities have gyms for people in wheelchairs or other problems . 
  they also accept memberships from abled people . 
  fees are usually ridiculously low . 
  income tax is federal . 
  any state taxes ( for workcover insurance , payroll tax or whatever they sneak in ) are paid by the employer . 
  local government gets the rates for owning land , plus fees for trash , water etc. 
  state government gets stamp duty on buying real estate , and gets some arcane proportion of the goods-and-services tax levied on its members . 
  a lot of that is because australians believe in keynsian economics and sailed through the gfc unscathed . 
  plot twist : there 's no dole, 
  depends on the industry . 
  if i get a contract at $ 75 per hour i feel a bit disappointed . 
  2 plex via ccp is more expensive than 1 gtc from eve time code . 
  com . 
  also if ou get a subscription you ca n't turn that into plex . 
  so start with a gtc but if you like the game , subscribe for 3 months via ccp . 
  le software . 
  i dunno , i figure 220 billable days per year . 
  still annoyed at chruker for not updating his site :-(, 
  the easiest way to get in ( working visa or immigration ) is via the skilled worker scheme . 
  well , you did miss two lacklustre years , but the last year has been * spectacular * . 
  you do n't * have * to mine with them . 
  it 's not a fucking job . 
  on the other hand , if there are fleet boosts , you could be mining 33 % faster than without their help . 
  yes , there are corps for everything as well as thousands of 3-man `` we do everything '' corps which generally suck . 
  and similar corporations are well known for their mercenary contracts . 
  there are many industrial corps out there . 
  aideron robotics is one industrial corp that does hire players to make stuff on their behalf - most other corps ( like mine ) will instead give you the infrastructure and let you loose . 
  you then get all the profit , but assume all the risk . 
  generally , it 's best to keep the combat and non-combat roles on separate characters , so you can have a character in two different corps if you prefer . 
  we also did what krugman suggested in 2009 so we sailed through the gfc unscathed , so that may have helped . 
  you know you * can * pay more than minimum wage , right ? 
  sure , are you mining in a retriever ? 
  otherwise you may have to haul ore back to station a lot . 
  fair enough . 
  procurers and retrievers are quite a step up for mining . 
  it 's a lot easier to be gracious when you just won the presidency .

  if you can lock them in time , sure . 
  export fees in highsec are quite high . 
  i do all my processing past p1 in lowsec with 1 % tax . 
  if you cash in a plex , invest in your character . 
  buy +3 attribute implants and skillbooks , not expensive ships that can be lost easily . 
  check market, 
  click ` buy ' . 
  supercapital ships are somewhat more intricate , since they cant be put on the market due to not being able to dock in a station . 
  the mittani has a sideline in accepting escrow from people for a supercap trade , then absconding with the payment . 
  perhaps the tuskers ? 
  fly a vexor instead . 
  note that you will need to work on your tank , whether you shield tank it or armor tank it it should be tech 2 . 
  google the eve uni wiki for what a tech 2 tank entails . 
  actually , i misspelt [ september ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternal_september ) . 
  imicus would work , since it has a probing bonus which you will need with low probing skills . 
  ( probably also has gravitational capacitor rigs ), 
  vexor has more slots , though , so it can handle tougher rats . 
  its called a nightmare . 
  combat skills and industry skills dont have a lot of crossover , so its good to have a second character for it . 
  once that is decided , why not make a new account ? 
  then they can both be online at the same time , and you can train skills on both at once as well . 
  just keep making new trials ... 
  anywhere from 15 to 11 dollars depending on how many months you add at once . 
  sure . 
  i 'll message you ; it 's bad reddiquette to post links in this subreddit . 
  well , it 's also because bots will get your account banned , and tiny miner , being a bot that 's famous enough for me to recognise , has likely been analysed by ccp already and the ban will happen even sooner . 
  i 'm not , but i will . 
  the carthum conglomerate npc research corporation has many distribution agents around [ shemah ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/kador/shemah#sec ) in amarr space . 
  high standings with carthum conglomerate also unlocks r&d agents with them .
