  faction warfare . 
  / r/fweddit, 
  you could try ( people pvp in sabres , and they 're interdictors too ) but they 're not any better than tech 1 destroyers for actual combat . 
  depends what you want to do with it . 
  if you want a pvp frigate brawler , then the merlin is a solid ship , with the harpy and hawk being two flavors of tech 2 assault ships that you can upgrade to . 
  if you want a fast tackler ship , then the condor is your go-to ship , with the upgrade path to tech 2 interceptors available to you . 
  if you want the ability to provide area effect warp disruption , then the flycatcher is what you want , but if you 're in faction warfare , you wo n't be able to deploy the bubbles in lowsec so it 's not very useful for you ( if you are in nullsec , flycatchers are awesome ), 
  dude , posting buddy invites is bad reddiquette . 
  just point them at the [ 21 day trial thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/14tgh5/21_day_trial_thread/?sort=new ) . 
  i assume you have all racial frigate and cruiser skills at iii , and destroyers and battlecruisers v ? 
  i usually buy ; unless you 're exceptionally hardcore and logged in always , you ca n't meet the needs of a manufacturer if they 're doing anything except modules . 
  i have about 1.4 b worth of mineral buy orders outstanding , and i can go through that in 12 hours of production if i 'm making ships ( it usually takes a lot longer because i do n't have ten identical bpos to run simultaneously ), 
  even if you build small stuff , you may not have access to all types of minerals so you 'll need to pick up at least a few mineral types . 
  i sell some stuff direct ; i chose a couple of systems and put some sell orders up there ; usually i buy minerals or have some other reason to go there , so my hauler does n't come back empty . 
  of course i also put up sell orders on some things in the station i make them in , just because . 
  if i have made something that is too slow to move , i can use the bulk trade mailing list . 
  a lot of stuff goes to jita , though . 
  prices are high on the weekend , which is generally the best time to sell . 
  which systems are you in ? 
  perhaps you should move somewhere more out of the way . 
  no , serpentine logic is my pvp main ; i have an industry alt that is rapidly becoming my main because i so rarely have time to login for long stretches . 
  industry , along with trade , is very high isk compared the amount of logged in time i spend , but it caps out faster than trade , because you only have ten manufacturing or research lines , but you can have hundreds and hundreds of open trade orders . 
  someone like / u/blakea combines manufacturing with trade , so it works out pretty well for him . 
  bored ? 
  well , sometimes , but that 's eve ; sometimes you feel like doing x , sometimes you do n't . 
  i do enjoy building things , so it 's pretty neat putting together a batch of stealth bombers for my alliance mates to explode in . 
  i contribute to my corp by researching their bpos , and generally coming up with hare-brained schemes to make everyone rich . 
  they then throw some isk into a wallet division and i come back in a week with a thousand gank-fit catalysts or whatever and sell them in systems full of miners that annoy us . 
  then we sell them replacement mining barges when someone kills them ha . 
  i had a good day selling coraxes during the retribution patch , and am continuing to have a bad day every time i try to offload the hundreds of procurers i made , ha . 
  also , just because you bought an expensive ship does n't mean you 'll keep it . 
  blowing up other ships first . 
  read everything . 
  read [ full disclosure ] ( http://fulldisclosureeve.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/the-purpose-of-this-blog/ ) , i hesitate to suggest reading gevlon 's blog but you can , read [ k162 ] ( http://k162space.com ) , read [ md ] ( http://eve-search.com/forum/3515-253 ) and learn to filter out the lies and manipulation , read patch notes and dev blogs ; anything that will give you an edge . 
  heck , in the last month , at least two people on reddit started trading so maybe track them down and ask them what they 're doing . 
  use tools . 
  for manufacturing , i use [ iph ] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/eveiph/ ) and [ drk ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/drk-industry-planner/ ) , for trading there are tools like [ mentat ] ( http://www.evementat.com/ ) and of course [ ec ] ( http://eve-central.com ) . 
  ` making lots of isk ' is n't a [ smart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smart_criteria ) goal . 
  ` making my first billion by easter ' is . 
  perservere . 
  always be building/trading something . 
  isk that sits in your wallet does nothing, 
  good to see another blog from wrote kapelle . 
  i got your back . 
  it is hard without a corporate blueprint library or other hand up ; module blueprints are cheap , but researching them is difficult to do in high sec due to 20 day + wait times on research spots . 
  having a corp research tower gives you essentially zero-wait research slots , which is a big advantage even if there 's no blueprints you can use . 
  some corps ( like aideron robotics ) will give you jobs even as a newbie industrialist . 
  they give you the materials and a blueprint and expect you to give the the finished product , and pay you x million isk per week . 
  it 's good income , but you do n't keep any of those extra profits . 
  other corps ( like mine ) offer a blueprint library with a small amount of support and say `` have at it '' . 
  this is good for the more ambitious industrialist , but can be daunting . 
  as for professions in the interim , it helps if you have some active isk-gaining income to match your passive industry income . 
  a common active task is mining , since , well , you 're going to use a lot of minerals anyway . 
  another option is to take hauling contracts , either for your corp , public contracts , or doing distribution missions for npc corporations . 
  courier missions have the advantage of raising your standings with a corporation that you might be doing a lot of trading , refining or manufacturing out of , which will decrease your ongoing costs . 
  also , some corporations have r&d agents who will give you free data cores , which you can pick up and use in tech 2 invention or sell . 
  a third option is to go into trade , which you will probably have as a sideline anyway because your finished goods need to be sold somewhere . 
  sometimes you can sell it to your corp or alliance , in which case you will need a couple levels in contracting and that 's it , but other times you want to put it on the market so some basic trade skills are useful . 
  and then you start thinking ` well i need some tech2 materials anyway , let 's put up a buy order ' and soon enough you 're doing a bit of trading on the side . 
  you can , of course , do all of these at the same time . 
  my alt can fly a mining barge , haul in a freighter , and has non-trivial trade skills , so i always have something to do ( except hard-core combat , since it can only fly frigates ), 
  tldr ; join a corp. 
  step 0 : take all the corporation shares and put them in your personal wallet , unless you like being on the receiving end of a hostile takeover . 
  i 'm not serious about it , judging by the amount of : effort : i consider changing characters is , 
  btw thanks for those maps of moon goo ; it must have been a lot of work to compile and make visualisations of them . 
  well , the pos system has been neglected , and since dominion cored out the pos forest strategy , the only major use for them is industrial . 
  `` do n't fix what is n't too badly broke '' has been the triage motto of ccp , and while the industry code base is n't the best , it is clearly showing its age . 
  small bones being thrown , like new bpos for the new ships that come out can sustain the industrial player base , but really it 's the recent changes in the ( meta ) game that have spurred interest lately . 
  if ccp rebalanced the t2 component chain , then you 'd see a spike in industrial activity as people scramble to adjust . 
  jester wrote a series of posts a while back on the balance between harvesters , builders and destroyers in mmos and it 's clear that the balance is somewhat out of whack , if not for numbers , then for support of their playing styles . 
  as far as playing styles go , industrial management works well for players who consider themselves ` enablers ' in ccp parlance and i think there 's a case to be made for supporting that play style ( the ui affordances made in the last year make it a lot easier to prepare fitted ships for contract , which i know has eased the lives of many logistics people ), 
  learning about the tech 2 production chain . 
  `` you mean i have to do this step , and make all these decisions , then go to this step , but then realise i need to decide whether to buy or build all these other components , then factor that into my profit oh wow '' . 
  another was the pi production chain . 
  `` oh , i 'm gon na need a spreadsheet for this '' . 
  and another was my first capital ship . 
  `` i built that . 
  and now it 's all gorwn up and it 's going to go out into space and cause so many tears . '', 
  the constant disconnect between corp-owned and personal-owned jobs . 
  they 're in separate screens in the jobs menu , i ca n't easily use personal assets to run corp jobs and have them go back into a personal hangar ( luckily i have my own corp hangar division but this does not scale ), 
  the ` choose which production line ' screen is a massive pain when you switch between personal and corp jobs , too , since corp jobs have to be type : corporate , range : constellation , but personal jobs are usually type : mine , range : station where blueprint is, 
  the fact that the invention screen offers decryptors that are invalid for the job you 're trying to set up, 
  ca n't see the ttl in the jobs window ( i do n't care what the date is when the job finishes , i care * how long * until it finishes ), 
  there 's lots that bug me about the trade ui too but nothing that comes to mind . 
  a lot of the time i pick products based on non-metrics-driven data , like patch speculation , or doctrine change for my alliance or others . 
  other times , i try to balance isk per hour and sale velocity with : effort : sometimes , i just cbf making the trip to jita under wardec so i just sit in station and crank out a few hundred hobgoblins instead . 
  i lean on eve-market-guide for ideas , even though the site is incredibly unreliable - if fuzzworks came out with a similar tool i 'd be all over it . 
  as far as hours i spend per day , i can do a lot of work out of game using drk , so usually it 's a case of `` fly to jita , buy everything i need for this production run , make buy orders for the next production run , fly back , set up jobs '' so while it can take an hour a day , i 'm usually sniping people in the head in dust at the same time so it 's not a drag . 
  i am a big , big , big proponent of using crest to make my logged-in time as efficient ( i.e. 
  low ) as possible while achieving my production goals . 
  it might not be the play style that ccp envisages , but it 's what i like . 
  i do , after all , have a life outside of game , no matter what my reddit stats show . 
  not sure about mining corporations ; i used to be in [ east khanid trading ] ( http://eastkhanid.co.uk ) , they did a lot of mining and mission-running . 
  [ tfone ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/trade_federation_of_new_eden ) also does a bit of mining , and they accept new miners . 
  [ push industries ] ( http://www.pushx.net/index.php ) has a micro-push freight service that uses smaller haulers ; perhaps newbies can start there . 
  [ yes there is ] ( http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/16229/10/5/1/5 ) . 
  fairly low levels , all told . 
  i have a hundred ships in build at the moment , but that 's a corp job so i only have 1 bill of my own money invested . 
  if i had less money , i 'd go all-out doing t2 module invention because the rewards-vs-clicking would be better ( assuming i chose the right thing to build , otherwise disaster ) . 
  i 'd also do a lot of blueprint copying and selling them - some of the guys in corp make capital ship blueprint packs which bogart the bpos but sell fairly well .
