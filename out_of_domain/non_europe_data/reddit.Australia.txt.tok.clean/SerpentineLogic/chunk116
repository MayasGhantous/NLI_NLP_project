  new planerary types, 
  high level plans for lava , gas , ocean planets . 
  internal cloud city demo created . 
  not anytime soon , at all . 
  map layouts, 
  maps are sewn together from ` recipes ' with socket types, 
  sockets can contain different infrastructure . 
  each district will contain it 's own unique ` recipe ' , so returning to the same district it should look the same each time . 
  environment shaders , terrain types , etc give more variation across planets/districts . 
  sorry for the format im on a phone, 
  / u/lockefox wrote it . 
  tldr : words :, 
  mix with ham bellicose for target painting action, 
  tldr ; you must balance jump ranges based on the range of the * first * cyno , be cause it doesnt matter how many cynos it takes to move long distances - you just throw more people at the problem . 
  even works when you drag people into fleet to invite them : they accept and go straight where you dragged them . 
  if youre worried , inject the skills now . 
  actually , a range nerf for combat caps . 
  nobody cares if you hot drop someone with anshars . 
  to be fair , jump freighters have killed nullsec industry , or perhaps have just allowed nullsec to cope without it . 
  anyway , these days without jump freighters you can still get access to empire via wormholes . 
  jump freighters appeal is the volume moved large distances with minimal effort , not the fact that you can cyno to empire at all . 
  worth a try . 
  there was . 
  it was called the northern coalition . 
  it got soft , invaded the russians and got shattered by them . 
  nope ; corp taxes do n't include transaction fees . 
  that 's why traders usually hide inside npc corps . 
  largest market hub in the game . 
  with max skills you can only launch 8 bombs at once , assuming ship bonused bomb type . 
  here 's something i whipped up [ earlier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/zztd0/any_advice_for_a_first_time_player/c6953ba ) . 
  tanked procurers are quite tough . 
  of course , they have no guns to fight back with , so that doesnt help much in lowsec . 
  industry isnt subject to corp taxes either , although there are clear benefits to joining a corp for industry . 
  society . 
  faster than light . 
  it has pause . 
  i would imagine that newbs would benefit the most from attribute implants . 
  i do n't care how long jump drive calibration v takes because i have a perfectly capable character already . 
  a newb could spend a month just training essential skills up to iii so each day of training is of crucial importance . 
  yeah no . 
  i pvp in +3 s and only get podded once a.month or so . 
  nova knives . 
  nova knives everywhere . 
  agreed . 
  it 's best to concentrate on activities that have little to no downside risk . 
  that basically means production instead of processing . 
  * mining, 
  * planetary management ( assuming you do n't buy any input materials ), 
  * blueprint copying, 
  next major release, 
  * robustness, 
  * accessibility, 
  * context of battles improved ( revamped starmap ), 
  * iterations to fw, 
  * planetary conquest v1, 
  * fixes to spawnpoint problems, 
  * new dropsuits ( factions variants ), 
  * new weapons ( faction variants ), 
  ** dropsuits **, 
  big change to system in the next release/expansion . 
  new roles . 
  skill and suit progression is changing drastically . 
  much more closer to eve ship roles ( unlock suits and then racial variants ) . 
  pilot . 
  covert ops . 
  ** playercounts **, 
  48 players . 
  24 vehicles . 
  eventually plan to expanded further and further . 
  ** graphics **, 
  still being upgraded . 
  big stuff for next release , especially for the map textures . 
  news shaders for guns , suits , environments . 
  improved loading times ( reduced texture popping times ) . 
  sir , let me introduce you to [ localscan ] ( http://raynor.cl/eve/localscanrecive.php?id=28 ) .

  `` csm8 : i hope you like : words : '', 
  the nightmare ? 
  a true blood raider ship . 
  hauling in highsec doesnt pay.much except fir rush jobs or if you do multiple contracts at once . 
  hauling contracts outside highsec doesnt exist , except via jump freighter . 
   i do n't know how using a jump clone will allow you to safely use expensive implants, 
  buy +4 implants, 
  swan around in highsec doing : stuff :, 
  3 . jump clone to an elcheapo +1 implant clone, 
  4 . pvp, 
  cruisers are pretty cool , but i would n't pvp in a cruiser unless i have tech 2 guns .

  and worth it , for the not-bad faction standings increase . 
  carriers are great for logistics in low-and null-sec space , but , as with any ship that big or expensive , you only buy one when there 's no alternative . 
  i believe judaism does , too . 
  only if there 's also placental blood for the placental blood throne . 
  it was 2v1 . 
  on an even footing , he 'd be pretty fucked regardless . 
  you must be new .
