  the old tutorial really was that bad . 
  `` here 's a red plus . 
  oh it 's attacking you . 
  good luck . '', 
  i have never had a pos attacked by dreads in lowsec , and they 've been there years . 
  it really depends where you put them . 
  [ yes ] ( http://outofcake.wordpress.com/about/ ) . 
  choose a set of [ pvp items ] ( http://k162space.com/2012/11/02/high-volume-pvp-items/ ) to make, 
  check the [ profitability ] ( http://www.eve-market-guide.com/invention.php ) ( ps that site has inaccurate prices , but it 's in the ballpack ), 
  sort out your blueprint me ( and pe if you can ), 
  furiously crank out bpcs, 
  1 . order the materials you 'll need, 
  start inventing, 
  safe , sane and carpentry . 
  it 's a list , rather than a tree , but how about this ? 
  i assume you 're crouching while using a sniper rifle ? 
  the sway also decreases a few seconds after you stop moving . 
  i have contacted eve-bet . com about setting up a pool for the matches . 
  and eve online . 
  just wow . 
  usually it takes a ship costing * at least * $ 1000 before we cut someone 's electricity cable . 
  yes , yes you did . 
  a raven ? 
  maybe $ 4 if he chose to use real money to replace it . 
  tell him to skip his next coffee and drink a teaspoon of cement , because it sounds like he needs to harden the fuck up . 
  no , that 's pretty much the least risky way to earn money . 
  i do n't think so . 
  remember that you can easily salvage faster than a player can generate wrecks , so you 're already above the curve . 
  ( also , salvage drones are pretty good ), 
  i read that in my head with a british accent . 
  `` are you mahd ? '', 
  and that person would be pretty sore after a few days . 
  looks like it was [ a cnr ] ( http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=18744293 ) . 
  i once tackled a neutral freighter in sobaseki . 
  it did n't turn out well . 
  account names do nothing ; only character names can be contacted . 
  lots of people go the trading route ; generally they then spawn off another account to train a combat character , then proceed to spend extravagant sums of isk on shiny ships for them , because there 's more where that came from , 
  an example of someone who trades :, 
  * [ full disclosure ] ( http://fulldisclosureeve.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/the-purpose-of-this-blog/ ), 
  gevlon also has a blog , but he alternates his [ good articles ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.hu/search/label/isk ) with objectivist ranting , so it 's a bit hit and miss . 
  however , he does have a good guide to [ starting out trading ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/p/newbie-guide-for-riches-in-eve.html ) and it 's hard to argue with someone who can donate 20 billion isk per month to an alliance just because he likes the cut of their jib . 
  technically , it was an awox . 
  i just wish i could batch - ** submit ** jobs . 
  generally for the first x months you 'll be doing a mix of electronics , engineering and mechanics support skills as well as gunnery and spaceship command skills . 
  support skills use int + mem, 
  combat skills use per + will, 
  so max int , with the rest in per makes sense from this perspective . 
  ( also navigation skills are int + per so you 'll get max training on those ), 
  after a few months once you consider your support skills to be ` good enough ' , you 'll probably remap for per/will and train combat skills for a year solid . 
  you 're mixing business plans . 
  1 . selling stuff to your alliance, 
  1 . handing out loans and charging interest, 
  one of these business plans is supported by the eve contracts system . 
  one of these is not , and relies on good faith and is thus doomed to failure . 
  dont call us ; we 'll call you .

  p11 doesnt have ps3 audio piped into the headset along with voice comms . 
  way more cars are happy than sad . 
  get your made-up statistics straight . 
  generally , passenger cars are designed to be smiling because buyers unconsciously prefer them . 
  sports cars , on the other hand , are preferred if they have an aggressive look , which includes any anthropomorphic features they may have . 
  but [ true ] ( http://www.livescience.com/5118-people-love-angry-faced-cars.html ) . 
  using attribute enhancers will increase the training speed of any skill that uses those attributes . 
  the majority of skills use intelligence or perception as their primary attribute . 
  in fact , when i got my sign-up bonus many years ago , the first thing i did was install all five basic attribute implants ( i had plans to train many types of skills , otherwise i 'd only have implanted four ), 
  ** tldr ; ** cfc pissing in hbc 's oatmeal . 
  ** tldr ; ** `` mistakes were made . 
  by boat . '', 
  i do n't think it 's held up indefinitely ; perhaps 12 hours or so ? 
  what if hbc did it to delay dissemination long enough to make a fortune ? 
  what if * cfc * did it to frame the hbc ? 
  what if * hbc * did it to blame the cfc for trying to frame * them * ? 
  such is life in the metagame , 
  ... invented in australia . 
  commonwealth high-five !, 
  if so , it would be more accurately called a lobbyist union . 
  if he truly does n't know , he 's not as good at politics as i originally thought . 
  i 'm [ not the only one ] ( https://twitter.com/ccp_fozzie/status/298848586656006144 ) who thinks that . 
  hmm , i suppose you could go back in time . 
  strangely , i find i 'm doing a lot of playing eve while waiting for my next dust514 match . 
  tldr only corpmates will accept random bookmarks . 
  the best you can hope for are tips . 
   freighters can not pick up jet cans . 
  tried recently ? 
  because : popcorn :, 
  this is true . 
  i was made director , and looking in the corp wallet , i was like `` if i stole everything , all it would give me is a few more year 's worth of plex . 
  if a firefight breaks out in jita i 'll be all over it . 
  for extra points , link them to the [ valv ^ e company handbook ] ( http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/04/read-valves-employee-company-handbook-its-amazing/ ) . 
  i once fit a 1mn microwarpdrive to my vexor . 
  i was wondering why it only went 10 % faster than normal ... 
  it only needs to be bne-syd-mel-cbr to be worth it . 
  in the mean time , make sure your first drop suit has a drop uplink . 
  a drop uplink is a piece of equipment that you can throw onto the ground ( preferably somewhere in cover ), 
  five seconds after deployment , it activates , and allows you to respawn at the uplink instead of in a random spot , if you prefer . 
  this is the same functionality has having a clone reanimation unit , except it 's a lot easier to destroy . 
  many countries , most of them first-world countries , limit political donations and in return give funding to every political party based on the number of votes they got in the last election ( provided they get above a certain low threshold ) . 
  it works quite well .
