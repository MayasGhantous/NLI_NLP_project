  the alliance tournament ? 
  thank heavens for a text summary . 
  try not to look at it while you type . 
  rates [ like this ] ( http://forum.eve-wtf.com/index.php?topic=2510.0 ) are fairly typical . 
  still posting here , i see . 
  merc pack is $ 30 in australia :(, 
  ( that 's almost $ 31usd ), 
  i once read a blog about a guy who picked up an obvious bait contract , then just before delivering it , refit his iteron for max tank ( shield extenders , damage control , reinforced bulkheads everywhere ), 
  when he undocked and got shot at , every ganker died and he nopenopenoped back to station with a bunch of kill rights . 
  ccp usually sends at least one speaker to gdc each year . 
  last year was also dust-related , iirc . 
  login to your account via the eve web site . 
  they often have deals available for returning players . 
  i 'm sure ccp will have * some * sort of deal for you . 
  `` let 's see , our options are :, 
  1 . let the guy pay us to play eve, 
  1 . not get any money, 
  hmm , what to do , what to do ... '', 
  a lot of people i know have had success with the walk on project . 
  generally that amount of shield regen benefits from buffing shield resistances . 
  the bonus of a shield recharger is n't actually that good in comparison . 
  i paid for the last two months of playing by logging in three times , for five minutes total . 
  your results , as they say , may vary . 
  marlona sky loves his battle iterons . 
  dbrb would lead ratting fleets like some sort of deranged pied piper . 
  a mathematician i know does that . 
  of course , she * also * only plays lottery when the jackpot means the expected value is  1 . 
  depends . 
  if they have to cash in loyalty points with interbus to get their corporate paint job , then i guess it really * would * be an interbus catalyst . 
  ... the dutch ? 
  ah , the singapore solution . 
  or a [ rap group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stutter_rap_%28no_sleep_til_bedtime%29 ) . 
  i used to trust other people . 
  then i started playing eve online . 
  a bottle of jaegermeister is the going rate, 
  you do know that corps of ten players + can have private forums on the eve forums ? 
  y u no link, 
  it 's 25 % higher now , 
  always primary ~, 
  do you consider 50k isk per jump lucrative ? 
  well , hauling rakes in less isk per hour than highsec ice mining unless you are working for a freight company ( in which case it 's still probably similar ) . 
  you do n't talk back to - a - ( wox ), 
  in asian cultures , pale skin is a sign that you do n't work outside for a living and are thus well-off . 
  flight centre used to make bank in the ' 90 's by doing something like this . 
  the deal was that flights from australia to the uk were really expensive compared to booking them in the uk , so what the flight centre reps did was :, 
  take down the details ( flying ex syd on december 1 and coming back january 1 ), 
  ring up the uk office and get them to book a ticket ex london on january 1 and coming back whenever ( let 's say february 1 ), 
  ring the airline and say ' a mistake has been made , my client is n't flying back on feb 1 , he 's flying on * december * 1 ', 
  flight is now organised from sydney , while paying uk ticket prices . 
  fairly certain you could pick it up in la and save yourself some more money . 
  it 's an [ eve ] ( http://www.kugutsumen.com/showthread.php?41813-kugutsumen-com-eve-faggot-awards-2012-nominees-for-the-dhd-quot-general-faggotry-quot-award ) [ thing ] ( http://themittani.com/news/nulli-secunda-alliance-update ) . 
  why are you building ships in a pos anyway ? 
  the hassle involved in getting the minerals to low-sec and the ships out dwarfs any issues you may have with manufacturing wait times in highsec ( assuming you do n't just choose an out-of-the-way station that nobody uses ), 
  i mean , capitals i can understand , but subcaps ? 
  i suggest you use a type 1 logistics suit , but you can roll with a militia suit although i do n't recommend it . 
  as always , downgrade to militia if required . 
  high slots :, 
  * basic shield extender, 
  * basic shield extender ( possibly shield recharger if you 're tight on fitting ), 
  low slots :, 
  * basic armor plate, 
  * basic armor repairer, 
  grenade :, 
  light weapon slot :, 
  * assault rifle, 
  equipment slots :, 
  * nanite injector ( or drop uplink if the team has no uplinks yet ), 
  the standings requirements is too much : effort :, 
  for your entire corp ? 
  are you the same guy who used to post articles to slashdot ? 
  spies . 
  that 's a bold statement to make . 
  overcoming adversity for its own sake is pointless . 
  a beginner training hard to improve at basketball is one thing . 
  doing it when you do n't actually like playing basketball is another . 
  sadly , in pub matches you need an assault rifle because you ca n't rely on your team mates , and you do n't have a sidearm to get you out of situations where your primary weapon is ineffective . 
  same [ surname ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katz_%28surname%29 ) implies shared ancestry ? 
  or perhaps male pattern baldness is common among males , which the name jon self-selects for , 
  equipment slots . 
  importxml ( ), 
  generally you 'll find the same corporations fighting in autz , [ including mine ] ( http://www.southernlegion.net/ ) , so feel free to apply to any of them . 
  well , actually there are low slot shield tanking modules ; the shield regulators . 
  you seem upset . 
  perhaps you should have written your reply two years ago like i did , to give you time to calm down . 
  do n't worry , i read it the same way . 
  buy a procurer and fit it out with tech 1 strip miners . 
  i wrote a thing about [ some fits ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ) you might want to try . 
  upgrade to a retriever . 
  ideally , keep the procurer around because sometimes you just want a lot more tank on your ship . 
  aim for a mackinaw , or maybe leave it at that for a while and explore other aspects of eve . 
  ice mining is often lower-profit than ore mining , because the blocks of ice are huge so you can leave [ your ice harvester ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/new-mining-barges-ice-harvesting/ ) on the same block for ages . 
  this makes it ideal for mining while you 're away from keyboard , which drives the price down ( less effort -  more supply available -  lower prices ), 
  kinda not an option for an existing corp with locked down bpos . 
  oh god bacon was so good . 
  not as good as sphere , or as ubiquitous as ap0 , but still awesome . 
  in fact , i think a legal version of bacon could be a cornerstone of an intel/scouting rework , if ccp wanted to take it on . 
  wow , you really * [ are ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/18erii/citadel_cruise_missile_sentrys_how_do_they_work/c8e8p74 ) * mad . 
  i have posted * nine * submissions from my blog in the past two years . 
  the rest have been as comments and judging from the upvotes , have been fairly well-received . 
  if other people have a problem with it , they know where the blue arrow is .
