  medium capacitor control circuit i, 
  not sure if the tank would hold up under the harder lvl 3s with your skills but it should be fine if you manage aggro and can perma run everything except for the ab with 3/3 or 4/4 cap skills although with max skills everything perma runs , carry a range script and a tracking script for the tracking computer and carry antimatter and lead ammo and do n't forget to change hardeners to suit the mission damage type . 
  you can run with a mwd + blaster fit for more dps at the expense of more risk , but since battlecruisers are a bit more expensive than cruisers , it 's probably best to use rails in pve for the time being . 
  i stole the fit from [ prometheus exenthal ] ( http://promsrage.com/ ) . 
  he appears to be * fairly * good at spaceships . 
  wow , that 's ... suggestive . 
  scorpions are already primary . 
  painting it hello kitty wo n't make it worse . 
  what were the differences in the parenting styles ? 
  how incredibly passive-aggressive of them . 
   science or abuse ? 
  yes . 
  giant tracts of it . 
  will smith 's wife has one . 
  look up the tv show the gruen transfer . 
  1.86 carat sapphire engagement ring checking in . 
  the short answer is that it 's under threat from technology that can make perfect diamonds , and are holding out by insisting that natural diamonds have pedigree over equivalent created diamonds . 
  oh , and diversifying , like the kimberley pink diamonds . 
  if you consider my advice advertising , then yes . 
  the gruen transfer is a show * about * advertising , with the managing directors of advertising agencies on the panel , so , yes , they 're quite good at this sort of thing . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/garmon123456?feature=watch#p/u/45/chlarfm4_zi ), 
  let 's just say that 1.86 carats of diamond would have cost many thousands of dollars more than the sapphire . 
   we are just using small metal bands . 
  to be fair , there arent a constant stream of newbies that ccp can afford to piss off , ljke blizzard can . 
   wow , best summary of wtf is happening in 0.0 i 've ever read, 
  you are mistaken . 
  wtf is [ nowhere near ] ( http://aggten.blogspot.com/2012/01/winter-sets-in-on-easter-front.html ) deklein . 
  that fit you posted is not going to work well , then . 
  oh , and learn what the shift and alt keys do when you 're moving groups probes about . 
  [ http://evenews24.com] ( http://evenews24.com ), 
  they 're biased and gullible , but amusing . 
  a rail ferox is not going to help this man 's quest to fly a deimos . 
  also , some corps are a bit anal about new pilots being willing to man up and shoot stuff , so having a bunch of kills ( and losses ) in your combat log is helpful . 
  recruitment officer receives unsolicited resume ; shocking , i know . 
  a standard booster can turn a losing fight into a winning fight using a t1 frigate . 
  i do n't see why expecting the same to be true for a 150m isk ship is so offensive to you . 
  such a tease . 
  i miss him so . 
  it 's like a mutual friend who sees you and your girlfriend fighting and does n't want to take sides . 
  except with more asciiart of penises . 
  they turn up to goon ops ; they just warp in and pick off the 30 % of the enemy that is n't blue to them . 
  send a petition to suspend your account . 
  that way you 'll be able to pick up with 75 days left when your pc gets fixed . 
  so , go swapsies with someone else . 
  the skills required to fly a kronos are applicable in wh space . 
  step 1 : get into a moros , [ shoot sleepers ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/how-dreadnaughts-kill-stuff-in-w-space/ ) . 
  ignore core targeting though . 
  that one is a trap . 
  some birthing centres are attached to hospitals , so you get all the couches and whatever , but if shit gets real , they put you on a gurney and wheel you over to theatre . 
  alternatively , get into a cloaky proteus and do pvp . 
  a lot of small corps would really benefit from this feature . 
  it 's automatically api-controlled to the corp , which is a huge plus , it looks easy to set up , and of course the price is right . 
  let 's just wait until ccp proves that the corp forums are secure before we start complaining about alliance forums , yeah ? 
  something for the bittervets to train , 
  what happens to the ex-crocodiles you handle ? 
  handbags ? 
  boots ? 
  invention requires datacores , which might be logistical issue . 
  still , it might be worth doing some r&d , especially if your pos is n't tight on cpu . 
  start with an advanced mobile lab ( cpu-heavy , which competes with hardeners but does n't compete with guns ) , which gives you, 
  * 3 copy slots, 
  * 2 me slots, 
  * 2 invention slots, 
  copy slots and me slots are what you 're looking for , since these are the ones in most demand . 
  invention does n't take anywhere as long as blueprint copying . 
  so , you want to make bpcs from three of the slots , and research me on the other two . 
  two advanced labs will keep your alt producing full-time . 
  as for what bpcs you want to copy ? 
  whatever you can afford and think will sell . 
  if you 're just starting off , buy cheap unresearched bpos for ammo that you use in the wormhole , or commonly-used pvp and pve modules and guns . 
  eventually , you can do ship bpcs ( ohgod covetor bpcs during hulkageddon ) but start with the basics for now . 
  research me on one while you make bpcs on the other for sale via contracts . 
  then swap , until they 're both researched , then sell one for isk . 
  do that for a while and you should have some good bpos and a stack of bpcs that invention people will pay money for . 
  how bout [ later this month ] ( http://blogs.crikey.com.au/whitenoise/2011/11/16/danger-5-i-want-you-in-me/ ) ? 
  well , you could do the ` year of support skills ' thing but perhaps the first year is best spent with max int , rest perception , because the first six months will be all over the place . 
  support skills are important , but it must be balanced with ship and gunnery skills or you will hate yourself and unsub . 
  after x months where you train support stuff up to iv , you then remap perecption/wisdom and do all those t2 ships and guns you just got the prereqs for . 
  if only there were a way for * clones * to * jump * around . 
  from what i 've seen , the avenues are :, 
  * ** internship ** : join established nullsec coalition as pets/guests/citizens , then prove worthy of getting sovereign space . 
  * ** political shmoozing ** : move to providence and make enough friends to get a system or two, 
  * ** opportunistic ** : hone your skills in npc nullsec then carve out some nearby territory , preferably those of someone terrible , while their coalition is busy elsewhere . 
  if you can hold it , you deserve it . 
  if you ca n't , try again at a later date . 
  * never * pvp with your missioning ship . 
  it wo n't be optimised for pvp * or * pve , and you will lose it, 
  when you lose it , how will you make the isk to replace it ? 
  in fact , a good rule of thumb is : ** do n't pvp in any ship you ca n't afford to replace twice . 
  having said that , it 's a decent t1 fit for pvp ( a mwd will be better , since you 're short-ranged ) , but it would benefit from some light drones in case you need to fight frigates . 
  it 's especially important since you do n't have a web . 
  everyone should have a hobby . 
  this was his . 
  more to the point , * nobody * can then claim to be the next dalai lama . 
  especially a puppet of another country . 
  i 'm no buddhist scholar , but i think you 'd have a hard time convincing them that you had a mind to change in between reincarnations . 
  maybe for * apple * ( 35 % margin in last financial year ) . 
  in general , corporations run at less than 8 % margin ; in manufacturing , often much less . 
  there are nine stations with cloning facilities in stain .
