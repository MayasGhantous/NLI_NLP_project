  limiting factor in what way ? 
  i believe ccp changed the logserver to not log entries and exits any more . 
  the only way to get it now is by python injection of the eve client , which ccp takes a dim view to . 
  a dim view like `` if we catch you , you 're banned permanently '' . 
  ah , yeah , pandemic legion had a suite of tools that could pinpoint anyone within scan range etc. 
  i do n't think they still use it any more . 
  just wow . 
  if it involves python injection , its bannable . 
  if it involves cache reading , its bad but ccp wont ban you yet . 
  if t involves in game browser javascript , it is ok . 
  probably easier to use remote explosives or prox mines . 
  i lean on grenades as my sidearm . 
  fit agility rigs and warp core stabs ? 
  tldr ; renters are great if you 're a landlord . 
  poach the good players ; get paid by the rest . 
  cache reading was fine until ccp sreegs declared it verboten . 
  i suspect he doesnt have the pull to get it banned because there 's no alternative he can give players to accomplish the same thing without cache scraping . 
  retrievers are really quite fragile in the hands of a newbie . 
  i almost lost mine a number of times before i got my tank and drone skills up . 
  stacking penalties mean there 's only so many modules you can stack on before it 's useless . 
  also there 's no difference between a 5.1 second align time and a 5.9 second align so after a point it 's not worth it . 
  i got into armour in my retriever mining in 0.5 space with 4 drones vov . 
  so , a higher minimum wage wo n't affect your store but will affect walmart ? 
  seems good . 
  i-stabs make you easier to target . 
  probably not a good idea . 
  pick a fight with a bloc and show how worthy you are by killing them repeatedly . 
  they are then meant to tap you on the shoulder and invite you into their secret clubhouse for flirty fishing . 
  it 's a bit like how boys are mean to girls they like . 
  it ' still a hassle when you get wardecced . 
  the guy from fulldisclosu.re has his api key linked in his first post . 
  it 's always tim tam time . 
  damps : already in game , in reverse . 
  you disappear off the enemy 's mini map . 
  tracking disruptors : smoke grenades . 
  ca n't see -  ca n't hit . 
  or just hide his posts if you have res . 
  um , perception + willpower remap plus implants ? 
  it 's ccp 's way of compensating au tz players for downtime being right in their prime time . 
  that 's the idea . 
  of course , there 's a lot of work that needs to be done first , so work gets done when it can . 
  ( not really ; ccp is n't that nice ), 
  i put some skill points into mass drivers i. i 'm liking it so far , although the physics still takes some getting used to . 
  better injectors are useful too , since it stops them falling over again immediately . 
   * the minmatar republic has gathered for its historical tribal council , the first since being subjugated by the amarr empire over a thousand years before . 
  however , there is still strife within the republic , as not everyone wishes the minmatar people well . 
  the starkmanir tribe , so-recently rescued from the brink of extinction , is setting up a colony on the planet vard vii with the assistance of the sebiestor field sappers . 
  but someone , perhaps a sinister amarr holder or a representative of one of the more conservative heirs , has hired the bragian order to destroy the settlement . 
   fight for the ** sebiestor field sappers ** ( defenders ) and protect the starkmanir settlement , or lay waste to them as part of the ** bragian order ** ( attackers ) on behalf of the amarr empire . 
   starting today at ** 04:00 gmt ** you will find multiple contracts issued in the `` mercenary '' tab of the battle finder between the sebiestor field sappers and bragian order . 
  the contracts will run until ** 08:00 gmt ** . 
  the outcome of these matches will impact the future of both sides . 
  indeed , and i suspect that something like that will happen for larger sorts of orbital bombardments or off-map artillery or whatever . 
  i must admit it 's amusing seeing people duck behind crates , as if that will save them from the splash damage i am liberally applying to their vicinity . 
  why not both [ ? 
  ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxxgu6dc3i1qzj5ty.png ), 
  there needs to be integrated news feeds into the dust mercenary quarters imo . 
  so , warp in at 100km and cloak up ? 
  all you need is to bookmark a wreck so you can come back later . 
  why not drop it off in aurcel instead ? 
  in the finest spirit of the eve universe , swap to militia dropsuit and start depleting your side 's clones , 
  obviously the mel-hnl flight is more full than the mel-lax flight . 
  eve-o [ campaign thread ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2600439#post2600439 ) for those interested . 
  since hans is n't running for csm8 , there 's a need for a candidate to represent low-sec interests . 
  as an ex-tusker , his pedigree of lowsec violence is pretty decent ; as an editor of tmc , he appears capable of stringing two sentences together without tragedy . 
  as a blogger about low-sec and how to fix it , his ideas are [ not terrible ] ( http://scaurus.com/beginning-the-campaign-in-earnest/ ) . 
  as such , if you 're looking to vote for someone who is interested in helping make low-sec better , he 's a good choice imo . 
  well , [ raw numbers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h0dav8t.jpg ) are fun . 
   how is kb/m ? 
  glorious . 
   and what faction is reddit on ? 
  player-run corps can ( and do ) fight for any faction at any time . 
  no ; it affects your facial features in eve , but so far it looks like dust mercs do n't take their helmets off , 
  you would be surprised how few aussies run missions :(, 
  we 're all in nullsec it seems . 
  i think australia is a better model for an alternative to the way the us ` recovered ' . 
  for one thing , none of their banks collapsed . 
  that doesnt help when other countries stopped buying iron ore . 
  my alliance has so many kiwis its not funny . 
  aussies dont have frats . 
  or bros , for that matter . 
  ca n't srspost , busy dusting, 
  only 260me , scrub . 
  any plans to do multiple blueprints at once ? 
  that way i could input a few likely bpos and have it tell me how many runs of each for minimum m ^ 3 . 
  for extra points , say something about king david . 
  i hope i still have the strength to do cpr when i 'm 92 . 
  but , that 's where the best intel is :(, 
  also , wow , you think about bonjourmadame a lot . 
  i just got sniped, 
  and this is crazy, 
  but here 's my drop suit, 
  so rezz me maybe ? 
  not according to [ these guys ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/salvaging-service-theres-a-corp-for-that/ ) . 
  yes it does . 
  this is as close as you get at the moment, 
  remember that passive skill points are not capped , so if you spend aurum on a passive booster , you will get all of it . 
  and , next week , prophecy . 
  do n't ask me ; i spend my time trying to work out how to login less . 
  i 'm down to twice a week for ~ 1 hour at a time .
