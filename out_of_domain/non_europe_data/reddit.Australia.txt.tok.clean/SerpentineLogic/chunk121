  edit : while still plexing the account . 
  there are microfinance companies in pakistan and burma who literally give out loans for people to buy sharpened sticks ( usually a length of [ star picket ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steel_fence_post ) ), 
  the idea is that , if you have a sharp piece of metal , you can husk coconuts fast enough to have some available for sale , instead of only having enough to feed yourself . 
  that 's how poor some people are . 
  i passed that a few months ago , on the way to getting perfect dreadnaught skills . 
  hmm , useful , but i was hoping for some sort of multi-variable regression based on all the blueprints i selected , rather than one at a time . 
  why cant you guys just fly one jump to highsec from egg ? 
  youre no longer a dust noob when you start running out of ammo before you run out of armor . 
  just one more man ? 
  how many men do you have so far ? 
  most icelanders are . 
  theyve had hundreds of years of kidnapping only the prettiest women , 
  plot twist : she is ccp seagull . 
  if anything , there 'd be a reddit * surcharge * . 
  thats old mans war . 
  peace and quiet . 
  it wo n't be so downsized forever , 
  teaching babies sign language is so helpful . 
  babies attempt to communicate well before they can vocalise words , so being able to express their intentions really helps . 
  my eldest daughter learned a handful of signs at three months ( milk , up , down , hug ) and it really made it easy to work out what she was crying about . 
  seriously ? 
  you 'd fly from jita to amarr with 800m isk worth of cargo for a 3.75 % return on investment , minus taxes ? 
  the ability to sell them stuff . 
  with any luck , chribba will update the page with details about what rank each skill is ( 1x , 2x etc ), 
  but it 's not even * good * money . 
  you 'll lose at least half of your profit to taxes . 
  then the rigs ( small sentry damage aug iis or similar ) are a scam anyway . 
  then again , gevlon comes from a country where 30 hours per month to get $ 15 worth of playing time is actually not bad . 
  i gather he 's up to 200m isk/hour now , which is considerably better , 
  tagging along behind other players and looting the wrecks they make can be profitable . 
  is n't there already data available in the sde ? 
  also if you see chruker , tell him to update his site :(, 
  generally the idea is to wait until they 've killed * everything * then headed off to the next site , then make your move . 
  there 's even a corp that [ arranges it ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/salvaging-service-theres-a-corp-for-that/ ) for you . 
  alternatively , he will get a free month 's playing time which saves him buying a plex anyway , so he should still give you a kickback . 
  i have been known to eat shellfish on occasion :(, 
  prophecies are now really tough arbitrators . 
  they are pretty neat . 
  only since the orca lost its immunity . 
  he can put his stuff on contract from anywhere . 
  a lot of monuments were burned to bring you this info . 
  no , so take a covops frigate instead and warp like the cops are after you ( which they are ), 
  each skill level you train costs twice as much as all the sp you 've put into the skill so far , so you encounter diminishing returns from day 1 . 
  you are * so obviously * not fetch . 
  just hold tight in 3 months time when the armageddon gets the same treatment ... 
  a famous australian tv presenter almost got punched by muhammad ali for saying `` i like the boy ! '' . 
  apparently ` boy ' is a racial epithet in the us ? 
  no , the geddon will be a really big prophecy , just like the typhoon will be a bit like a big cyclone . 
  i dunno ; ask kil2 . 
  he 's the one who will be doing it . 
  apparently its existence is [ news to ccp explorer ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2632802#post2632802 ) , too . 
  i just set the fleet to hierarchical view and let the chips fall where they may . 
  yes , he just started as a game designer .

  a more newbie-friendly take on it . 
  note that it gives you more specific detail about the fits , but does n't really explain why to fit it that way . 
  they could easily make an entire expansion worth of work out of fog of war/intel changes . 
  however , it doesnt have the wow !, 
  factor so it would end up going in piecemeal over twelve months . 
  \\ #highsecproblems, 
  this is why i only use psn cards . 
  barring catastrope , ccp wo n't do any more resets . 
  yes , eve is an ecosystem , but that 's the worst description of the ecosystem i have seen for a while . 
  miners are sheep . 
  they have no teeth . 
  they do n't bite anything . 
  pvpers of pretty much all descriptions are wolves . 
  they prey on sheep , and if none are available , they will pick fights with other wolves . 
  what 's lacking in the eve ecosystem is support for sheepdogs to protect sheep but kill wolves . 
  without support , the sheepdogs turn into wolves and the sheep go back to the high paddock . 
  high minimum wage means fewer desperate single mums . 
  aussies dont have one - or two - dollar notes , so strip clubs get expensive fast . 
  unless you just drop a handful of change down their g-string like , uh , a friend i know . 
  tldr ; op confuses marginal return of highsec vs nullsec with game theory to arrive at a muddled argument . 
  you know how people call the internet the information superhighway ? 
  the nbn is the optic fibre equivalent of the us interstate project . 
  lots of money , huge project , entire country benefits , business calls it socialist but will totally use it anyway . 
  why do companies charge more ? 
  because they can . 
  blame the developers for shitty phone lines . 
  forest lake was built in the 90 's . 
  i talked to awox a few days ago . 
  he doesnt play eve any more :(, 
  everything looks like its on a tv ? 
  thats the * point * . 
  you dont digest it , so bacteria do , which causes massive gastric bloating and the runs . 
  i can tank about half a pizza but i really wouldnt like to try a glass of milk . 
  you can buy lactose free milk . 
  karma hot drops vov, 
  the first rule of freight club ... 
  probably not worth it . 
  if you 're going to go triple dda , just keep the trimarks . 
  i think the first time i went into lowsec , i found a battleship rat and killed it for 500k isk . 
  then i went to the next belt and found another . 
  after that , i was hooked on lowsec .
