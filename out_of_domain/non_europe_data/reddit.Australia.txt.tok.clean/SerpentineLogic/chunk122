  til that the company that made [ my blender ] ( http://www.thermomix.com.au/what-is-thermomix/get-to-know-thermomix.aspx ) also made a [ bitchin ' machine gun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gast_gun ) in ww 1 . 
  i ca n't believe you did n't call it quackbot . 
  shotgun trained to 4 , sharpshooter 2 . 
  perhaps the racial strategic cruiser skill can be left at i ( but why would you , overheating so so awesome ) . 
  all the subsystems should be trained to iv , with the important ones being trained to v ( personally , i think they 're all important but i wo n't judge you if you leave electronics and navigation subsystems at iv ), 
  some amarr ships fit missiles . 
  dust devs have stated that they 'd like to extend orbital bombardment capability to other weapon types , but at this stage they 're not ready . 
  logically , a dreadnaught 's orbital bombardment would cover an area so large that , given the current size of dust maps , everyone and everything would be nuked to hell . 
  they need larger maps and more hardened targets before it 's worth opening up bombardments for larger weapons . 
  actually , ccp devs run development builds of dust514 on their pcs so the chance of dust running on x86 is literally 100 % . 
  i think it 's inevitable that ccp will move to ue4 . 
  ccp has shown over the last ten years that they 're not afraid of tackling mammoth projects to keep their games looking the best . 
  eve has been through at least two major reworks of the entire graphics engine so far . 
   pretty hard , because i do n't think people from sweden have german accents . 
  many swiss speak a dialect of german , so it 's a different accent but can sound similar . 
  which is it ? 
  a corp in 0.6 or lower space , or ** -0.6 ** or lower space ? 
  sounds pretty j4g ... 
  lol i am so terrible / o \\, 
  confirming that industrial corps have essentially zero wait times for research and copying . 
  er , you do know you can do multiple levels of research at once ? 
  sure it will take 12 days to research each blueprint but you can always run different ones in parallel . 
  also , ammo is probably a bad thing to produce anyway . 
  try r.a.m.s or something . 
  about 80 % , give or take . 
   maternal research time, 
  best research time , if you know what i mean . 
  stuck in a door ? 
  there 's an [ algorithm for that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exponential_backoff ) . 
  you require :, 
  a [ pebble ] ( http://getpebble.com/ ), 
  [ aura ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aideronrobotics.android.aura ), 
  [ pebble notifier ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin ) to link them together . 
  thanks to baynex for [ working out how ] ( https://www.aideronrobotics.com/discussion/1870/pebble ) . 
  god * damn * i love living in the future . 
  i get it couriered from the nearest trade hub . 
  an alliance without a logistics backbone is a bad alliance . 
  [ source ] ( / r/eve/comments / 18xydd/so _ apparently_you_can_do_this_now / ), 
  sure , why not . 
  done . 
  learn to fc ? 
  so , turn off that feature for a while ? 
  tbh there should be separate bots for each site so people can hide them using res . 
  1st gen ipods were kinda lame , too . 
  i hear they got better . 
  nah , individual feeds would be too granular . 
  depends on the exact vote count method , but if the one i think will get chosen ends up being selected , the next csm election will be state of the art . 
  of course . 
  then again , the cost of living in russia is a lot lower . 
  boot camp , then . 
  something fast , like an incursus to start with . 
  start by taking on frigates and cruisers and leaving the battleships to last , ideally orbiting them closely with afterburner on . 
  after that , a cruiser would make the whole process more efficient , especially if you ca n't break the tank on a battleship with your frigate . 
  either way , insure your ship and stay alert . 
  as the quote goes , `` there is nothing more exhilarating than being shot at - and missed '', 
  generally the idea is to make alt characters on the * same * account . 
  pi alts do n't take many skill points to make . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://evesp.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/how-lowsec-became-viable.html ) do . 
  something something [ tobin tax ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobin_tax ) ... 
  presumably your watch , too . 
  [ way ahead of you ] ( http://www.eveonline.com/universe/spaceships/ ) . 
  dust514 is free ... 
  tip : you can actually spin the ship . 
  change your shipping address to the usa, 
  buy digital goods, 
  receive email with codes, 
  change shipping address back . 
  in summary , nullsec mining provides sufficient volumes of high-end minerals to supply the entire eve cluster , so the prices are fairly low . 
  since the removal of gun mining via drones and looting , and the ban hammer on mining bots , supply of low-end minerals has dried up , hence the price rises . 
  the price of highsec ores wo n't stay above that of nullsec ores , since when that happens , a bunch of nullsec miners stop mining abcm and start mining the ~ ~ high ~ ~ low-ends which changes the supply , but they can hover close together , precisely because they 're all mined from the same ships so the extraction rates are similar . 
  if there were a capital mining barge that only targeted trit , then you 'd see low-end prices drop , since a nullsec miner could actually supply more low-ends to the market . 
  edited, 
  yes it is . 
  surprisingly , most rl countries do n't have it . 
  sure . 
  going all 4s should only take a couple weeks ; even less if you buy all your inputs and [ only do processing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) . 
  i guess the goal is to increase the supply of low ends somewhat , without crashing the high end market . 
  if there was a super null sec veldspar crystal , trit prices would fall , and everything else would rise a small amount . 
  assuming there are enough veldspar . 
  rocks in null . 
  perhaps you 're just hanging around with people you ca n't stand . 
  perhaps try a [ no teenagers allowed alliance ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/get_off_my_lawn/corporations ) ? 
  3 billion + just from the prophecies . 
  where do you live ? 
  my local butcher has chicken breasts for \\* breaks out imperial units calculator \\* $ 5.40 per pound . 
  i did n't even have sound for the first few weeks i played . 
  aside from missing out on the whizzing sound of bullets flying past me , it was n't too bad . 
  this is a fairly easy thing for ccp to fix . 
  if you 're looking for naked pictures of mintchip , i have some disappointing news for you . 
  ^ & nbsp ; ^ ... they & nbsp ; exist . 
  is your shipping address in the usa ? 
  you should ask on whirlpool . 
  i. e. 
  / r/dust514 that way . 
  yes . 
  i know that feel . 
  really ? 
  my alliance is chock full of kiwis . 
  they even have a . co.nz domain . 
  please tell me when you enter a market , so i know when to exit .
