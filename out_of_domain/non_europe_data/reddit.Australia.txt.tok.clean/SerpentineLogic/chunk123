  in brisbane , the suburbs have late night shopping on a thursday night , but the city has extended trading on friday night . 
  yeah , clones and hardware were p1 items that showed up on the crucible singularity database . 
  there 's a difference between rocking up at coles at 10pm on a tuesday night , and expecting a fashion store to be open then ... 
  so , do n't buy t2 components and make them instead . 
  lol i think i have some gear in axdx too . 
  it really is the arse end of nowhere . 
  i know [ that feel ] ( http://xkcd.com/303/ ) . 
   should n't it be their choice on what food they want to buy ? 
  like op said , if it were their money , then they can spend it on whatever they want . 
  if it 's money given by someone else , be it the government , or a particular charity , then it can come with conditions attached . 
  we 'll update it when it gets wildly out of date , but it 's fairly current . 
  well , i suppose you could head out from torrinos and say hi . 
  there 's always someone in ec-p8r local . 
  lockefox posted his version of a t2 [ industry alt skill plan ] ( http://eve-prosper.blogspot.com/2013/01/everything-you-never-wanted-to-know_24.html ) . 
  it 's comprehensive . 
  note that you can get into tech 1 manufacturing as soon as you have a few levels in mass production and at least production efficiency iv , which can be achieved quite quickly . 
   jaguars w / chain of miner , refiner , and manufacturer, 
  this is your problem . 
  most manufacturers buy minerals . 
  a * lot * of minerals . 
  way more than can be provided by that character mining away . 
  i admit i sometimes undock in a barge on my industrial character , but i have no illusions i can keep up with the mineral demands of even a part-time industrialist . 
  you reach the level of ` screw it , i 'm putting 120 destroyers into build so i can courier them to jita when i login tomorrow ' much faster than you 'd think . 
  r.a.m.s , too . 
  those things take * forever * to produce , so t2 manufacturers will pay a premium to buy them off market and free up some production lines . 
  red text is how long it will take you if you do n't get any sp from playing games . 
  blue text is how long it would take to grind it if you were playing a bunch of ambushes until you hit the sp cap . 
   recommendation for what i need to start out in a logistics role ? 
  logistics suit ( type 1 is fine , militia is not ), 
  assault rifle, 
  shield extender, 
  shield extender, 
  basic armor plates ( not militia ), 
  unless specified , militia grade is ok , but basic grade is a lot easier to fit and/or works better . 
  prioritize shield enhancements iv for complex shield extenders , and field mechanics and shield control for extra armor and shield hp . 
  remember , as a logi , you do n't have a sidearm so always fit grenades in case they rush you while you 're reloading ( or you feel like rushing them ), 
  the gallente and caldari are n't friends , which you 'd expect , since the gallente are space-french , and the caldari are space-germans-with-japanese-system-names . 
  i once lost a tengu to a gang because i was reading reddit while ratting . 
  these days , i just skip the ` undock ' step . 
  i have good news and bad news . 
  good news is that you may well see me on the battlefield . 
  bad news is i 'm not in subdreddit so i will be shooting at you at the time . 
  [ destination unknown ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destination_calabria ), 
  i sometimes put my ( half-empty ) freighter on autopilot and deliver some alliance contracts . 
  not really . 
  people do n't generally gank freighters carrying 250m isk worth of stuff when there are a stream of other freighters flying past full to the brim . 
  never sell your main . 
  getting in on the ground floor . 
  is the j\u00f6kull the same root as j\u00f6kulhlaup ? 
  because i loved that [ card ] ( http://magiccards.info/dm/en/15.html ) . 
  no , the import taxes are n't especially high ; it 's just that most international companies just mark stuff up a lot when selling in the australian market , because they can ^ tm, 
  speaking as an australian , keynesian economics is working * pretty well * for us , thanks . 
   by making the minimum wage `` livable , '' you hurt the people who do n't need a `` livable '' minimum wage , ie . 
  teenagers . 
  most other countries scale their minimum wage down if you 're young . 
   the australian dollar does n't have as much buying power . 
  oh , it 's [ fairly close ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) . 
  depending on the metric you choose , it 's within 15 % of the usa . 
  unless you push for a $ 1.75 pay rise , as you should . 
  you 're correct in that it 's not the fault of minimum wage , but tilian is incorrect about import taxes . 
  it 's about companies charging [ economic rent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_rent ) . 
  [ online ] ( http://sales.starcitygames.com/cardsearch.php?singlesearch=jokulhaups ) ? 
  the internet . 
  where men are boys . 
  where women are men . 
  where 14 year old girls are fbi agents . 
  yes ? 
  does n't explain the cost of imported goods , especially digital goods , or why cars made in australia sell for 20k more than the same cars shipped to the usa . 
  that makes literally no sense . 
  the australian treasurer wrote an article [ expressly attributing ] ( http://www.fabian.org.au/1140.asp ) his handling of the gfc to keynesian economic thought . 
  from the essay :, 
   `` if we are going to be keynesians in the downturn , we have to be keynesians on the way up again . '', 
  also , if you think australia has lower taxes or less fiscal regulation than the united states , you are woefully misinformed . 
  tbh it 's a lot easier to just build small auto cannon and other modules and sell to fweddit . 
  we 'll get up a youtube response soon ( tm ), 
  i sincerely hope that reprocessing stuff lowers the industry index , otherwise there will be a lot of ` build shuttle , reprocess , build shuttle ' action happening . 
  could this be one of the new scout suit types ? 
  it 's also good to have a stash of anchored secure cans to use as fuel dumps . 
  ok , guess nobody here knows about armoooor hacs . 
  as * if * militia junk plus a grenade is worth 15aur . 
  it has to be the suit + modules . 
  anchor it outside of d-scan range of a celestial . 
  the chances of someone finding it are miniscule . 
  even then , they discovered your midpoint fuel drop , so what ? 
  fit a [ procurer with a tank ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/procurer_tank.png ) . 
  guaranteed to be last choice when it comes to being ganked . 
  you can tank a procurer up to 75k ehp . 
  might as well mine in a procurer . 
  similar tank , better yield , 10 % of the price . 
  you also do n't have to jetcan mine , so you have to factor in the avoidance of [ rsi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repetitive_strain_injury ) from moving the ore twice a minute . 
  i 'd mention going into the computer gaming industry , but it 's just as abusive . 
  i do n't know . 
  probably . 
  what is that in utc ? 
  i guess you 'll be playing against a lot of australians then . 
  no , because the best use of insurance is to put it on ships you 're intentionally putting in harm 's way . 
  you 'd be surprised how many ships that are coming up to 3 months insurance die in suspiciously suicidal roams . 
   how long would it take to train a alternate mining character ? 
  [ 51 days ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/creating_an_alt_miner ) . 
   would i have enough time within a 30 day free trial to rack up 600mil ?
