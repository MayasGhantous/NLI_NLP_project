  how hard can it be ? 
  to be fair , practically all prescription medication in australia costs [ $ 35.40 or less ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pharmaceutical_benefits_scheme#patient_co-payment_and_safety_net ) per scrip . 
  do n't forget the [ 11-foot long pigs ] ( http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/05/31/76805_todays-news.html ) . 
  [ seems legit ] ( http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/05/31/76805_todays-news.html ) , though . 
  four spaces at the start of each line enables, 
  i think this is what you want . 
  one or two elutriation rigs make a big difference to cap stability . 
  i 'm sure pl knew [ what they were doing ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/01/attrition-warfare.html ) choosing abaddons over geddons . 
  depending on the meta , you 're probably better off with napocs now though . 
  you 're the only one who 's assuming he meant pve . 
  * you talk about how abaddons are generally pvp ships, 
  * you mention cap stability, 
  * i mention elutriation rigs, 
  * you go off-reservation , talking about geddons , although you neglect to mention you 're now talking about pve . 
  i think it 's safe to say i 'm dealing with someone with issues following his own train of thought . 
  this conversation is over . 
  the first five did n't take . 
  did n't this come through via rss yesterday ? 
  the new omni implant looks interesting ... 
  yes . 
  militia refers to inferior versions that have no skill prerequisites . 
  they 're a bit like civilian stuff in eve . 
  militia suits are generally not useful ; sooner or or later you will want to get in a real suit . 
  being dropped into npc corps between being recruited into player-run corps is usually a sign that they were kicked . 
  if you see that a lot , then they 're probably [ not worth recruiting ] ( http://evewho.com/pilot/aitackleblus ) . 
  are we in a pun thread , or are we just going through the * motions * ? 
  and my axe !, 
  militia grade gear requires no skill points to unlock and is ridiculously cheap . 
  generally it 's either weaker , or harder to fit than basic grade gear though . 
  in that case , a cheap hauler will do fine if the gate is scouted . 
  you 'll still lose it to cloaked gate campers but if you 're only moving frigates the total loss will be low . 
  sure ; it 's how most people do it . 
  i bookmark the customs offices with the name of what gets exported from that planet . 
  try playing dust :( if downtime hits during a match , you get no sp and no isk for it , but you still lose all the gear that you died with . 
  you do n't say . 
  it 's the knockon effects that are most annoying . 
  * nobody does skirmishes within ~ 45 minutes of downtime, 
  * nobody does ambushes within ~ 20 minutes of downtime, 
  * after downtime , it takes ages for the matchmaking servers to come up . 
  in short , downtime makes about 1.5 hours of au prime time a horrible experience . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  down time is very convenient for ccp , since it 's in the middle of the day in iceland . 
  if things go to tits up , the whole company is around to help fix it . 
  well played , op . 
  1 . on the eve web site when it goes live in the next month or two . 
  fourteen people , although only seven go to iceland for summits ( the rest can alarm-clock and attend via skype ), 
  the same as the assault ii , except with a complex damage mod vov . 
  tech 1 logistics frigates and cruisers are always welcome in fleets . 
  they 're also really cheap to fit , which is a bonus . 
  [ rebel wilson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebel_wilson ) would beg to differ . 
  followed up by `` eve online , a terrible game '' . 
  they 're helping the banks a tiny bit , but they 're helping a lot of people get out from under crippling debts . 
  evidently it 's a trade-off they 're willing to make . 
  what about gaming networks ? 
  surely sony , nintendo and ms would be interested in clamping down on that sort of thing . 
  or , better , just force matches to end 30 seconds before downtime , distribute isk and sp , subtract equipment losses , then shutdown gracefully . 
  many apps , like dropbox and google + allow for instant upload of pics and/or video . 
  or you can use apps like qik to upload as you record . 
  yes . 
  range is a bit short , but the damage output is quite good . 
  `` what evidence ? '', 
  you go into low-security space , and wonder why you have a low level of security from being blown up ? 
  please post chat logs ( the eve client logs them ) and we will critique them . 
  i like the idea israel has with organ donation ; organ donors get bumped to the front of the queue if they need organ transplants . 
  in fact , you might already have some stored away in < documents directory  \\ eve \\ logs \\ chatlogs, 
  without an armor repairer , your ship wo n't be very sustainable in missions . 
  still useful in incursions though , since there are other players available to rep you up . 
  well , i suppose there 's always [ techfleet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ki2ov.jpg ) . 
  i bet agil would be a decent-sized trade hub though . 
  well , that 's * one * way to make friends . 
  i guess he really had his picture ... 
  * taken * . 
  aka / u/sarmatiko, 
  you may like to read what he [ said about the nag ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/19pgyg/capital_v3_now_with_actual_link/c8q9pwz ) seven hours ago . 
  however , in this case , raising the minimum wage also means cost savings for the government due to fewer people working full-time yet still relying on food stamps and other forms of welfare . 
  there 's a case to be made that raising the minimum wage will reduce the externality that employers are benefitting from at the expense of taxpayers . 
  probably not worth it for most situations . 
  please , can you make an rss feed for devpostfinder , ideally without the foreign language forums ? 
  the one on the dust forum is polluted with bbcode :(, 
  come to think of it , the same feature would be great for evesearch too . 
  flux grenades do close to a thousand damage vs shields , so a few of those ( ideally thrown by someone standing on a nanohive ) will make an impact . 
  the problem is that shield tanks are fairly zippy so unless you are very well prepared , they 'll just drive out of danger . 
  barring more details , it 's a 2.5 % rate of return . 
  just put the money in a high-interest bank account instead . 
   much less subject themselves to the whims of another capsuleer more than absolutely necessary ? 
  i 've wondered that myself , usually during long structure shoots . 
  it 's fair to say that anyone looking for investment advice on reddit does n't have a million dollars to throw around , let alone a billion . 
  since the crucible expansion ~ 18 months ago , things have [ really , * really * improved ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls6xy ) . 
  player counts are at record-breaking levels , subscriptions are up , bittervets are now bitter about unsubbing instead . 
  you 're probably better off joining an npc nullsec alliance . 
  small corps in nullsec alliances quickly lose their individual identity . 
  i think you 'll find that the dust gms are taking a much more proactive approach to the lore ( technically , it 's many of the same gms as the eve event team ), 
  did you see how the ceo of imperfects got [ written into ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&amp;nid=5045&amp;tid=5 ) an in-game news bulletin , as an npc faction reacts to his player-run event ? 
   when we see an interesting place for player interaction with the lore to be acknowledged , we 're going to try to tie it in when possible in the future . 
  we 've been doing it with our live events in eve , mentioning organizations who got involved in events . 
  we 're not planning on tying things in too tightly , so that if a player organization falls apart or the like , it wo n't negatively effect our lore . 
   it 's definitely a change from how we used to do things , but we feel like dust ( and eve ) are player-driven games so we want to keep that consistent with our lore . 
  another thing to note : if your team loses the match , you lose the tank anyway .
