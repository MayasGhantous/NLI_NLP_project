  nobody knows for sure ; i believe ccp eterne was going to ask the devs to release a bit more information about how they work . 
  just rp for now , although who knows what will happen once districts provide resources of whatever kind . 
   is there anything else i may be missing with regard to uplinks ? 
  has anyone got numbers on how many spawns you get for each uplink type ? 
  you ca n't explain that . 
  it happened to me :(, 
  must be a bug . 
  would doing a transform on the eve forum rss be easier ? 
  your 5 part blueprint guide is now out of date :(, 
  i gained a lot of respect for him from that ama . 
  ship was fitted with ccp dev shield extender , making it unkillable . 
  better yet , concord arrived . 
  many tears were harvested . 
  i will sell you as many 15-run me70 exequror bpcs as you want , for 79m each . 
  do n't let hillary catch you . 
  if i get the drop on someone , i 'm fine but i melt under return fire in a militia suit . 
  these days type 1 is the lowest i 'll go unless it truly is a ` being rolled ' situation . 
  i strongly suggest he has two different ships ; one set up for pvp and one set up for pve . 
  they can be the same hull type , but that fit ( 2 plates , 1 repper , 3 trimarks , no mag stabs ) is not going to be particularly good at pve , not even incursions . 
   to me it tastes like burnt beats in dirt with a gasoline finish . 
  that evokes the delightful image of skrillex being hit by a flamethrower . 
  he can afford to lose at least four taloses for every nmega he undocks with . 
  i always freak out seeing neuts in local . 
  fortunately it has been over a year since the last time i tried to tackle a freighter in highsec . 
  feel free to suggest it on the d514 forums ~, 
  and keep us posted . 
  the eastern front . 
  just like battleships then . 
  here 's one i [ prepared earlier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  [ literally 44 minutes ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/19vm89/thinking_of_reactivating_eve_biggest_changes/ ) . 
  \\  talks about pvp conflict for pages upon pages, 
  \\  wonders why word association is skewed, 
  `` weeerll , you gotcha straight porn , gay porn , trap porn , group porn , my little pony porn -- '', 
  `` my little pony porn ? '', 
  `` rule 34 of the internet , son . 
  rule 34 . '', 
  crucible is where ccp really kicked it up a notch . 
  i believe it was the second-longest patch notes since the game was released . 
  when undocked , you stay in your pod . 
  there were tech demos of exploring outside your ship using the incarna engine , but they 'll probably wait until world of darkness gets all the kinks worked out before they spend any eve time on it . 
  maybe only on the storefront section ? 
  my fenrir brings all the boys to the yard . 
  more likely shotguns with [ beanbag shells ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bean_bag_round ) . 
  blackmail , of course !, 
  mostly , i feel like `` job well done , chaps . 
  light the return cyno and let 's break out the cigars . '', 
  merica . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  does he surf ? 
  to be fair , he has a lot of practice apologising . 
  yes . 
  i hope small missile turrets get updated too . 
  try using [ fleet-up ] ( http://www.fleet-up.com ) . 
  generally you 'd eat the hind legs and tail ( roo tail soup is a thing ) and leave everything else the hell alone . 
  `` sorry we wrecked your car . 
  here 's a voucher for a free coffee . '', 
  z , but it 's usually bugged out of game . 
  game design . 
  the premium cuts off after you 've paid ten years ' worth , btw . 
  no , the people who work out what features they should have . 
  not sure , probably left arrow . 
  check the mappings in the settings screen . 
  yes , this works . 
  assuming a non moving target : [ this ] ( http://www.eve-wiki.net/images/7/72/evefalloffrange.gif ) . 
  if they 're stationary , none of that matters . 
  much ink has been spilled about this over the years . 
  a friend of my dads was conscripted and went to vietnam . 
  problem was that he was of chinese descent . 
  he ended up sewing an australian flag to the back of his fatigues , just so the americans would stop trying to shoot him during join missions . 
  if there 's no station in system , then you 'd need to install your blueprints in a lab to work on them . 
  that increases the risk of speculative destruction by a fair bit . 
  personally , i 'd offline the shield hardeners or run with only three . 
  having said that , there 's a case to be made for dropping to a small tower since it 's only going to be you , and you ca n't realistically defend it , so just run it lean and write it off if it gets blown up . 
  the fuel cost of a medium tower is 80m per month more than a small tower . 
  that adds up . 
  the last time i ran pi , i was pulling in 50000 p0/hour per planet , which netted me ~ 15mil/day per character after processing into robotics , so 5mil/day is actually quite low for ten planets . 
  well , you 're not really gaining anything until you reach 80,000 dollars . 
  ** tldr ; ** no , because you 're buying isk from another player , not ccp . 
  that seems like shaky logic . 
  time zone ? 
  it 's not insane ; perhaps unsustainable , but you 're eating a lot of stuff that fills you up without being insanely bad for you ( yeah , fruit juice is full of sugar , but actual oranges are ok ), 
  did you get charged and have to go to court ? 
  tldr ; he 's not crazy , he is just [ being ironic ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/why-cant-anyone-tell-im-wearing-this-business-suit,11185/ ) . 
  [ crazy ironic ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/why-cant-anyone-tell-im-wearing-this-business-suit,11185/ ) . 
  sample bias . 
  fewer good fits die . 
  i admire what james represents , but i 'm also aware that his changes , if implemented , will kill off all the sheep he feeds upon , leaving only starving wolves feeding on each other . 
  ironically , for james ' ideas to work , he also needs better tools to fight people like him . 
  my experience with university it services usually ran with the following script . 
  `` hi , i ca n't access x because bittorrent . '', 
  `` do you need it for a particular course at this university ? '', 
  `` well ... '', 
  `` then no . '', 
  more like trojan sheep . 
  you might get some training until the next downtime , but that 's about it . 
  actually , you may find that doing incursion sites is a very attractive alternative to running solo level 4 missions . 
  a maelstrom or equivalent would be fine . 
  still less appealing than tanks , and just as impacting to the game . 
  tbh scout sites need a strong buff . 
  scanning skills are the most important , as is being able to fly a cloaked ship .
