  still , it shows that it 's scientifically possible to determine when a vet has turned bitter and is about to unsub . 
  does your professor plan on doing another study on eve 's more recent performance , or is that a job for you grad students ? 
  you certainly could n't have afforded uni , that 's for sure . 
  hence the bachelor of medical accounting degree available at miskatonic university . 
  if she fell ill while working , why did n't her employer foot the entire bill ? 
  what crazy country is this ? 
  of course it pays dividends ; i see wts contracts for 1.5 billion per unit . 
  so far there 's no evidence that they 're anything more than reskins like the various types of catalyst floating about . 
  but do you get plex , or just game time ? 
  you 'd think so , but there 's a lot in the chaos builds that never sees production . 
  heck , there 's an entirely new launcher version that just mothballed so they can put bit torrent in instead . 
  it 's a lot better before down time, 
  i believe fuzzworks also does a database dump . 
  perhaps they have races to see who gets theirs out soonest after a patch . 
  ** tldr ; ** clones , clones everywhere, 
  * move dust clones to a new district for battles , just like a board game . 
  * use clones stored in the district to defend during battles . 
  * if a district hits zero defending clones , it flips . 
  * owned districts grow more clones each day, 
  * excess clones are sold off to npcs for isk, 
  * more info [ on the wiki page ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/planetary_conquest ) . 
  there 's [ this ] ( http://dustboard.com/global/skills/ ) , but that 's about it . 
  also , it 's a really good idea to create a dust character now , even if you have to borrow a friend 's ps3 for a few minutes . 
  characters gain skill points just by existing , so when you finally get to play , you 'll have a lot more than the starting amount of sp . 
  i love your show !, 
  some of the people on the show are * really * not putting any effort into their appearance , though . 
  one word : estonia . 
  many states in australia have licensed brothels . 
  it 's the * un * licensed brothels that cause the problems ( sex trafficking , health issues , organised crime etc ) . 
  skill points are n't wiped after dust went open beta , barring apocalyptic bugs . 
  however , ccp have said that if they remove a particular skill for whatever reason , then you will get refunded any skill points you spent , so you can reallocate them . 
  i got that a few times last night , too . 
  let 's halve it , because i have seen previous statistics that it 's only 30 % . 
  compare that to the rest of the world , where medical bankruptcies are about 2 % of the total . 
  it just * does n't happen * elsewhere . 
  as is usual in ` peasant uprisings ' , nobody listens to the peasants after the uprising . 
  technically it was n't ` the rich ' . 
  it was ' ** everyone he did n't like ** ' . 
  malaria is mostly quinine-resistant now anyway .

  it just happened to me :(, 
  unless you buy and sell to npcs only , you 're still interacting with other players , so that 's okay . 
  he 's not the first to [ call bullshit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/on-stagnation-in-nullsec/ ) on this thing , and he probably wo n't be the last . 
  `` why are you hitting yourself on the head with a hammer ? '', 
  `` because it feels * so good * when i stop . '', 
  you must be doing it wrong . 
  i only login when my mobile tells me to , 
  no , that 's just watching a movie using your imagination . 
  the eve player is * writing the script * . 
  all i know about political rhetoric i learned from eve . 
  you 're asking a guy whose reddit user name is lifted from a region in eve for unbiased advise ? 
  under normal circumstances getting podded only sets you back what it costs to replace your clone and any implants . 
  if you have n't paid to replace your clone , then getting podded can result in skill loss . 
  this is bad . 
  do n't do it . 
  as soon as i got recruiter roles . 
  so many spies and thieves ... 
  `` the future is already here -- it 's just not very evenly distributed . '',

  `` i have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible . 
  however , i have seen the house that it built , and it is terrific . '', 
  -- michael caine , on his thoughts about a bad movie he starred in . 
  that 's because you do n't need to give them roles . 
  oh god put time stamps when the topic changes so i can skip to the ones i 'm interested in . 
  if they get a big enough fleet , they can use 1200mms instead . 
  will you have access to an e-book reader ? 
  presumably a really cheap one , since i hear there are lots of criminals in prison ~, 
  ah , the assange gambit . 
  i guess she 's really good at, 
  delivering little things, 
  when i was a kid , i never thought that magic : the gathering would be around * twenty years later * , so it 's certainly possible , 
  * facekindle * , more likely . 
  tldr ; hedge against inflation by buying plex . 
  logistics suits do have backup weapons . 
  they 're called grenades . 
  i 'm fairly certain ccp really did n't want that to go live just yet . 
  my revised dual lands are older than justin bieber , and have been tapped less often . 
  it 's the skill books that cost you . 
  he 's [ running ] ( http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/assange-looks-to-contest-senate-election-20121212-2ba43.html ) for the australian senate . 
  i do n't think you 'll get a very good dreadnaught pilot in 6 months . 
  having said that , support skills first , then remap for piloting/weapon/drone skills . 
  i agree . 
  we do n't even login , how did we get 6th spot ? 
  hardly active in us time zone , so they are less famous . 
  i carry a mine in every ship , just for the amusing loss mail . 
  remember . 
  you 're a spaceship captain , not a fighter pilot . 
  they 're pretty vicious , too .

  with the isk you need to buy a proteus , you can buy three ishtars . 
  there has to be * some * upside to having downtime right in your prime time ...
