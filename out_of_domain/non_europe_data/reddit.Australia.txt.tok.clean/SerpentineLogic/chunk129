  our $ 2 is thicker though . 
  when i was a kid , i used to glue two 5c coins together in an attempt to buy $ 2 items from vending machines . 
  you know you 're in an upscale restaurant when they do n't even put .00 on the menu prices . 
   rare seared marinated wagyu sirloin s/w truffle mushroom chat potato , stir fry vegetables , onion crisp in a truffle red wine jus : ** 36 **, 
   spices & chardonnay poached golden queen peach w / mascarpone , macadamia cannoli & ice cream : ** 12 **, 
   i ca n't see a reason for the 2 cent coin ... 
  the 1c , 2c , 5c , 10c , 20c and 50c split makes for fewer coins returned as change for any number from 1 to 99 , compared to the us denominations . 
  that 's why there 's a $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 50 split for larger denominations . 
   you do n't get rickets if you stay indoors most of winter do you ? 
  no , but scientific evidence suggests that women with dark skin have reduced fertility in temperate and polar regions . 
   i wonder if their dress standard played a part at all ... 
  they actually got the same test subjects to try again using a few different sets of clothes . 
  apparently business suits or military uniforms raised the chances a huge amount .

  if i were a cynical person ( which i am ) , this is the way i would think it really happened :, 
  jg : rudd 's still sniffing around , and worse yet , everyone knows it . 
  that fucker abbott will be all over us until september . 
  it needs to end , * now * . 
  sc : but how ? 
  jg : simon , this is what i want you to do . 
  act like you 're sick and tired of the leadership contention . 
  people will believe you since you put your hat in the ring last time there was a leadership spill . 
  announce that it 's time for me to let a spill happen , and that you are campaigning for deputy pm . 
  sc : but i 'm not campaigning , julia , i 'm loyal to you !, 
  jg : shut up simon . 
  we want to force kevin 's hand . 
  he does n't have the numbers , and a leadership ballot will put him back into his hole . 
  sc : but what happens to me afterwards , julia ? 
  jg : you piss off to the backbench , having taken a bullet for the party , and proven your loyalty . 
  i 'll get you an ambassador position after the election . 
  now get to it . 
   what was labors excuse then ? 
  they had 2 decades of experence and still fucked shit up . 
  i blame andrew fraser for the privatisation fuckup . 
  the queensland health fuckup was just bureaucrats being bureaucrats , but it happened under bligh 's watch so it 's legitimately her responsibility . 
   how does the commissioning party cast the results into doubt ? 
  depends on the questions . 
  `` in light of the media reports of the newman government legalizing murdering kittens , and bankrupting the treasury via a series of double-or-nothing bets on lance armstrong being clean , have you lost faith in the current state government ? '', 
  fly there and wait . 
  go to sleep early , wake up at 3am ? 
  no , although you may have fewer people to legally shoot at , but that 's ok , you 'll usually have npc actors to ~ ~ shoot ~ ~ interact with . 
  so , wait until people start getting suspect flags , then go for it .

   hi there features and ideas !, 
   i 'm ccp 's newest game designer . 
  as some of you may know , i 've been a pretty dedicated eve player for quite awhile now , and i 'm very excited to start working to improve the game as much as i can . 
  i 'll be contributing to a range of projects i 'm sure , but for the immediate future my biggest focus will be balance . 
  i bring a lot of my own history and experience into this role , but i 'm also the first to acknowledge that eve has an enormous variety of environments and situations . 
  that means you all can always help improve my perspective on the game . 
   at the moment i 'm spending a lot of time thinking about attack battlecruisers and tech 1 battleships specifically . 
  i want to open this thread in the hopes that you guys will contribute thoughts on those topics . 
  i would push you towards more high level/meta discussion rather than hyper specific attribute adjustment type of stuff , we just are n't to that stage yet . 
  if i can validate my own impressions about the state of balance regarding these two classes through your contributions , i 'll feel much more comfortable going forward !, 
   excited to be here , look forward to hearing from all of you !, 
   ccp rise, 
  safe regions make alliances fat and soft .

  the fenrir is the fastest and most agile , which makes a big difference over long hauls . 
  60m/s vs 80m/s is a big difference .

  i do n't know about the us , but in my country , many children of immigrants are hired as teens in fast food joints , presumably because of their work ethic . 
  aussies pretend that they say it all the time , but it 's a lot less commonly said here . 
  sure . 
  australia takes a certain ( low ) number of immigrants each year . 
  it is also one of the countries most biased towards skilled migration ( vs family reunion migration , humanitarian reasons , eu-style reciprocation etc ) . 
  i saw an infographic that illustrates this but i ca n't find it :(, 
  so , generally , successful immigrants self-select for motivation ( or else they would n't bother trying to get in ) and have been screened by the australian government to select the ` most worthy ' applicants . 
  part of this screening is for desire and ability to work . 
  there also have been studies ( in the us ) that show that children ( and to a certain extent , grandchildren ) of immigrants tend to express certain desirable traits , such as a strong work ethic and high regard for education , at a greater rate than the native population . 
  i have only read studies of us immigrants , but i suspect it holds true for most western countries . 
  so , if i were an employer on the look out for highly-motivated teenagers , i will most likely end up with a higher proportion of staff from immigrant backgrounds than society as a whole . 
  just bear in mind that p4 factories can only be placed on temperate or barren planets ... 
  true ; reading about eve politics is a popular pastime for retired eve vets .

  generally combat and industrial skills should be done on separate characters .
