  if it turns out showinfo was wrong and the cloning facilities do exist , i will happy train laser turrets for that phantasm :p, 
  so , they 're basically just changing the operators/administration of the eve servers from cdc to another company .

  slytherin has all the 1 % ers though . 
  proteus does heavy tackle better than the gallente recons ( much like lokis are tougher versions of huginns ) . 
  they 're also the only strategic cruiser that retains a decent amount of dps when fit with the cloak subsystem , which makes them prized for surprise pvp . 
  or money laundering . 
  there 's an option in the esc menu that turns on a visual session change timer , so you know when you 're allowed to , e.g. 
  redock after undocking , or whatever . 
  if a girlfriend wo n't agree to a legal document that says `` at the very least , i 'm keeping the house because * it 's mine * '' then it 's good to find out earlier rather than later . 
  $ 1k consultation fee buys advice * and peace of mind * . 
  so , what you 're saying is either throw caution to the wind or die lonely ? 
  that opinion seems ... insufficiently nuanced . 
  especially with gallente ships and their large number of structure hit points . 
  well , i * do * prioritise houses i own above people i 'm not yet sure i can have a stable , long-term relationship with . 
  perhaps i 'm just conservative that way .

  ** manufacturers in other countries : ** `` i hear that mothers of newborns are touchy about chemicals .

  to be fair , the return on investment for lobbying in the united states is somewhere in the order of 2200 % . 
  taking measures to force businesses to spend less money on lobbying is good . 
  taking measures to make ** politicians ** less susceptible to lobbying is better . 
   how are the t3 battlecruisers doing ?

  get a shuttle bpo and make shuttles in lowsec . 
  mark them up 500 % who cares , they will sell if there is no competition . 
  it 's not huge profits but it 's great marginand exposes you to non traditional markets . 
  search for the eve travel blog . 
  he 's doing exctly bwhat you plan to . 
  where are you situated ? 
  high-sec ? 
  which region/constellation ? 
  what is your local market like ? 
  what reasons do people go there for ? 
  last time i kicked off a manufacturing job , it took almost three days to complete . 
  if you want long-running jobs , ammunition takes ages to make in volume , which is why many industrialists get out of the market . 
  it might be decent volume and decent margin , but the isk/hour/slot rate is low . 
  research can be done anywhere , as long as you 're prepared to wait in a queue . 
  it would help to know which region you 're in ( and thus , which pirate npc types you 'd expect ) . 
  agreed on a carrier . 
  i have been playing for over a year , and last time i put a capital ship into my skill plan , it would * still * be another 18 months before i would feel comfortable flying one . 
  oh , some of the lower sites have been boosted a fair bit . 
  if he runs serpentis ports or whatever , there 's always the chance of an escalation , and all the loot is in one spot . 
  that area is probably a nullsec entry point . 
  find out which system has the most cyno fields ( check the map while you 're online , or check killboards of the surrounding lowsec systems ) . 
  there 's probably a market opportunity for shuttles , liquid ozone , cyno generators , exploration frigates ( the ones with the large cargo holds for cyno fuel ) and stuff of that nature . 
  the volume will be low , but the margins will be high . 
  ok , looks like you 're heavily into caldari , and shield-tanking . 
  on that basis :, 
  prereqs for recon ships , and ecm skills for falcon, 
  prereqs for logistic ships ( at the very least , join some incursions ), 
  prereqs for heavy interdictors, 
  basic leadership boost skills to iv ( ideally siege warfare spec to v so you can run a not-terrible warfare link on your tengu/vulture ), 
  t2 launcher rigs . 
  give your tengu some respect . 
  other rigs you use to iv as well . 
  it 's only a day or two each . 
  missile launcher support skills to iv ( bump to v for the signature - and explosion velocity-related stuff ), 
  navigation skills : very important . 
  they 're a bit on the low side . 
  advanced planeteology trolololol, 
  thermodynamics v would be nice . 
  you ca n't fly any tech 2 frigates . 
  you 're missing out on stealth bombers and assault frigates . 
  you 're not missing much with the caldari interceptors tho . 
  offensive and defensive subsystems to v. do this right now . 
  advanced weapons upgrades iv or higher . 
  consider large hybrid specs for the naga . 
  um , yeah that 's probably enough for now . 
  then you should have picked up a cheap hauler and done itinerant trading , 
  its low compared to making jump freighters i guess . 
  t2 rate of fire rigs and t2 explosion velocity/radius rigs are standard on tengus . 
  hmls are also fairly common , since they can hit out to 100km and use t2 ammo very effectively . 
  thermodynamics is a pvp-related skill , but remember that any skill that reduces stuff ( like cap recharge or heat buildup ) gets better as you level it . 
  the difference between 100 % and 95 % is small , but the difference between 80 % and 75 % means your stuff burns out a fair bit slower . 
  as far as t2 frigates go , gallente have very good assault frigates and interceptors , but since you have no armour skills , perhaps you might start with harpies and manticores ( the nemesis is a bit hard to fit ), 
  this man knows what he 's talking about . 
  he has built more capital ships than i have had lossmails . 
  yeah they do . 
  it 's called [ backscatter x-rays ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backscatter_x-ray ) . 
  minus sales tax and transaction fees , which are probably at least 5 million isk off the top . 
  courier contracts : cheaper than the alternative . 
  upvoting . 
  you ever tried to send an evemail via smartphone ? 
  half the time it wo n't even let you because the html markup it * put there itself * is forbidden . 
  did they scam you in-game ? 
  then that 's allowed . 
  his name was likely not ` ah fook ' , although it 's a common misconception when referring to cantonese immigrants . 
  my family tree is full of such facepalms . 
  an equivalent translation to english would be ` that fook guy , eh ' . 
  or possibly , ` fooksie ' in the common vernacular . 
  best to practice on cheaper hulls then . 
  the short range on many gallente ships means you can not disengage when you 're losing . 
  the ` victory or death ' aspect of the ships takes some getting used to , which is why it 's important to get player experience in picking your fights .
