  a canny csm would already have a blog post ready in preparation for the announcement ... 
  or an even easier way to check :, 
  otec may die , but the isk it raked in remains . 
  i often run assault suits , so a 22/2 kill rate is an indication that i 'm doing my job . 
  one of the episodes introduced the ceo as an elderly man getting back into the workforce after retiring a few years ago . 
  seemed plausible . 
  seems ok now . 
  yeah many of my pub fits do n't even use a gek any more . 
  food is expensive , rent is expensive , cars are expensive , petrol is expensive , * but you can afford it * . 
  ( also health care is cheap ), 
  yes , which is why it 's not packed to the gills with three hundred million people like the us . 
  dust and eve characters must be separate , since the dust recloning technology is incompatible with capsules . 
  it 's worth making a polandball comic about , anyway . 
  dat area effect healing . 
  perhaps ask in / r/subdreddit ? 
  being able to carry a second hive is worth it though . 
  but it fails if you have the skill training queue window open already . 
  essentially , yes . 
  australians [ do n't know how lucky they are ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/21/australians-julia-gillard ) . 
  also , anyone who signs up via a ` recruit a friend ' link will get a free assault rifle blueprint ( not sure whether it 's the same stats as the exile ), 
   my character named pussyfucker sixtynine, 
  i hope you like being renamed gallente citizen 134630523459 . 
  i ` mma let you finish , but [ you 're wrong ] ( http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/affect-versus-effect.aspx ) . 
  saying ` test is effected ' means that someone has accomplished the test alliance , which i can only conclude would result in disbanding the alliance . 
  make sure you 're personally sitting in the ship you most want to get moved ( unless it 's a capital ship , because that 's not getting moved to jita anyhow ) . 
  sometimes the gms only move your current ship , rather than all of them . 
  message sent . 
  for now , here 's some light reading material :, 
  * http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/, 
  * http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46, 
  jackie chan was an extra on a bruce lee film ; not the other way around . 
  depends on the martial art . 
  shao lin derivatives , specifically hung gar , love their forearm strikes . 
  in fact , one of their techniques boils down to ` block so hard your arm gets sore , then you 're forced to use your * second * - best attack '', 
  `` how many boards can you break , mister miyagi ? '', 
  `` do n't know . 
  never been attacked by a tree . '', 
  that did n't come about by magic . 
  singapore worked hard for decades to accomplish it . 
  * add actual eve channels to it , irc style , except capturing back-history, 
  * eve calendar export hooks , so you can export or import from google calendar or whatever, 
  * eve mail hooks , so you can receive and send evemails in gmail . 
  * ideally , integrate eve voice , so i do n't get kicked off voice comms when my client shuts, 
  * integrate notifications in a non-retarded , non-buggy way . 
  basically , nothing eve gate does is actually novel . 
  it 's all solved problems , reimplemented in a lacklustre manner . 
  actually * integrating * eve using existing , publicly-available rl tools via crest is a much better use of time . 
  hell , the eve forums do n't even have tapatalk support . 
  i would kill 3.01 . 
  so fetch . 
  that was a good update . 
  i 'm sure they 've all been suggested three years ago when evegate was released . 
  wait , did i meet you at the brisbane eve gathering on saturday ? 
  i stopped using the injector in pub matches . 
  too few people worth stabbings with them . 
  probably the reason . 
  drop up links are team access when you 're not in a squad , but most are squad access only if you are in a squad . 
  here 's one i prepared [ earlier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/v7d51/eve_drinkscocktails/ ) . 
  australian too . 
  probably commonwealth-specific . 
  also , r.a.m. 
  items have good margins , but they 're slow to build . 
  most industrialists do n't want to build them because they need the manufacturing slots for more expensive stuff . 
  it 's quite a lot like mag . 
  it 's mag-like . 
  smaller games at the moment , but much more resources available in the long-term . 
  ccp does n't make disposable games . 
   the quickest way to be ineffective in dust is to charge at the enemy by yourself , nullifying any chances you can be revived/actually kill a group of enemies . 
  on the other hand , you get to hoard all the glory ~, 
  o7 is more of a salute . 
  current dust matches are 16v16 . 
  that will be raised as the maps get bigger , but you can always choose your match type ( and thus size ) when deploying as an individual or fire squad . 
  true . 
  it takes both skill points and in-game experience to spot and capitalize on situations where the correct choice is to up the tempo and go hunting , vs sticking with your squad . 
  vov ` fuck knows ', 
  i ca n't even use advanced suits :(, 
  it 's a beta ; you 'll fit in fine . 
  there is a strong esprit de corps in a dust corporation . 
  one would think that a 3/3 slot layout would make you pretty tanked up ? 
  finding someone to play with really is n't that difficult . 
  there 's the ** lfsquad ** custom channel that you can subscribe to for pickup squads , or just join a game solo and join squads with empty slots in-game . 
  alternatively , there are any number of corps that you can apply to - i applied to the corp that tends to be at the top of the leaderboard during my time zone ; you may have other criteria , such as / r/subdreddit which accepts active redditors and thus is , well , gigantic . 
  personally i 'd run a codebreaker on a scout suit instead ; most of the time you spend will be getting to the points rather than hacking it ( having said that , i have hacking ii which does cut a couple seconds off a hack ), 
  i find the high level armor plates slow me down too much . 
  if i had 3 low slots and wanted a good mix of armor and mobility , i 'd run an enhanced plate , an enhanced rep and either a second rep or a utility low slot ( sensor booster , shield regulator or whatever ), 
  it 's just a [ funky dance move ] ( http://eyesworldwide.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/walk-like-egyptian.jpg ) . 
  or , as the meme goes [ ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3xyvnac.jpg ), 
  i 'm usually online about 12:00 utc , so maybe , maybe not , 
  as a newbie , you 'll probably find the militia sniper rifle to be manifestly inadequate . 
  if you can , use the charge sniper rifle . 
  you have to hold down the trigger to charge it , so your rate of fire is low , but it does 60 % more damage per shot . 
  for extraction planets : i have an extractor ( 10 heads ) dumping into a spaceport , plus enough basic factories to handle average load ( i.e. 
  if i pull in 47000 units per hour , i need eight factories ), 
  your set up will look a bit like [ this ] ( http://ardentdefense.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pi-1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xlifshtxe_u/t1ckokrnvti/aaaaaaaaafy/te47hcaj8x4/s1600/pi+setup+-+114.png ) . 
  generally , you then process all your p1 materials into p3 at a fifth planet , which usually looks a bit like [ this ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pi_factories.png ) .
