  fit a tracking computer instead ? 
  revelations have enough low slots to roll with capacitor power relays . 
  i approve , even though it pains me to see my talos less overpowered . 
  look up [ atap booster guide ] ( http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/jowen/atap_booster_production_v1.1.pdf ) ( pdf ) . 
  if you only played a trial the first time , then get the $ 5 deal . 
  i believe you can still use it to get 21 +30 days playing time ( although whoever gave you the trial wo n't get the free gifts they normally would if you used a full-price subscription ), 
  ** the southern legion **, 
  mercs : who knows . 
  probably 250 or so . 
  capsuleers : two . 
  not more than two . 
  average member age : very few teens , that 's all i know . 
  about us : we 're arguably the largest and least-terrible au time zone mercenary outfit in dust . 
  as the saying goes , we 're * big down under * ^ tm, 
  there 's a few , but they 're a lot smaller so you usually only see them in pairs in pub matches . 
  if you want to model the changes in eft , switch out all te iis for tech 1 . 
  shield talos w / null : used to be 16 +29 , now 15 +25 . 
  still acceptable . 
  how 's the ping , though ? 
  reddit posting history cares little for confirmation bias . 
  israel has an interesting twist on the situation . 
  * organ donation is optional , but ... 
  * organ donors also get bumped to the front of the organ recipient waiting list . 
  til there exists people who have phones without shazam installed . 
  person a : `` hey guys , hey !,

  * people look up person b 's comment history *,

  use the proceeds from the plex for trading , not hauling, 
  1 . bulk hauling is best done by other people via courier contract, 
  high value hauling is best done in a blockade runner ( or courier contract ), 
  chasing bargains via hauling is often less profitable than concentrating on the trading you 're doing in-station , which is precisely why most people use courier contracts instead of doing it themselves . 
  i remember the days when songs came on cassette tapes , so yes . 
  fair enough . 
  i suggest you look into training for a fenrir then , with a detour for a prowler . 
  aussie poor is like usa poor , but with health insurance . 
  way better . 
  in most countries , this type of scheme is extended to everyone in the entire country . 
  sadly , you ca n't pirate a copy of good healthcare . 
  well , they * are * freighters . 
  ok , i guess if you 're starting from the bottom , you fly with, 
  1 . a probe ( 400m ^ 3 + ), 
  1 . a wreath ( 310m ^ 3 + ) or hoarder ( 5100m ^ 3 + ), 
  1 . a mammoth ( 5625m ^ 3 + ), 
  obviously , those are minimum cargo sizes - you will usually fit expanded cargoholds in the low slots , and shield extenders and shield hardeners in the mid slots . 
  if you need to , you can even fit cargohold optimization rigs , but after a point you 'll probably limit how much you carry because t1 haulers are too easy to lose in a gank . 
  then decide whether you want to go for large cargos using a fenrir , or small cargoes in a prowler . 
  or both . 
  generally , though , you only buy a freighter when you have a clear need to , or you 're on your way to piloting a jump freighter . 
  ** tldr ; ** the math checks out . 
  in soviet eve , groups of people are filled with assholes . 
  your api checks out , which means if you are a spy , you 've at least put the effort in . 
  ps you should put more juicy gossip in your evemails , they were a bit boring to go through .
