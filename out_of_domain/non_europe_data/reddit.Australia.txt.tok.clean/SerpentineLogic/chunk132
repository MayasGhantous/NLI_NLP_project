  edit : oh , * disposable * income , split amongst the entire * household * . 
  back to the middle class i go !, 
  so , i 'm playing [ line harvest skirmish ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/images/2/25/lineharvest_skirmish.jpg ) and so far it 's been a great match . 
  lots of back and forth , great small-unit tactics from both sides , snipers and counter-snipers going hard at it , a tank on each side , the works . 
  it 's a pub match so i 'm not in a squad , but there 's a couple of corpies on each side so i knew i 'd be in for a fight . 
  this match was surprising in that the majority of players on each team knew what they were doing . 
  we 're pushing hard to take point a , and the reds are holed up around a , defending the cru on the hillside and using it to send flanking scouts towards d and b. 
  we 're stuck at the choke point between b and a , so i drop a cistern for the blues to regroup at and follow a heavy in . 
  while the heavy gets everyone 's attention , i pop a couple guys hiding down the side of the building , climb up and clear out a few people from my vantage point on the roof . 
  ( they were taking cover inside the null cannon , since the heavy was hosing down the entire area ), 
  a steady stream of reds respawn from the cru over the next 30 seconds , but i have backup on the roof by then . 
  a red gunnlogi drives down into the area , but does n't survive the barrage of grenades we throw on top of it from our vantage point . 
  at this point , i 'm out of ammo ( again ) so i drop another cistern . 
  over the course of the next few minutes , i 've killed a few more reds but i 'm down to my last ar clip and do n't have much smg ammo left either . 
  the reds arepushing again , and squad of five flanked from d and were pushing us off the point . 
  i rush down to the other building near a to flank * them * and got involved in a messy brawl down the side of the building . 
  shoot a logi wailing on me with a mass driver . 
  switch to smg , kill the assault suit behind him . 
  fall back , reload , kill the next guy , climb the ladder , get caught halfway up , jump off again , throw a grenade that misses , shoot the guy with my smg , he backs off around the corner in low shield . 
  i check my hud :, 
  shields : gone, 
  armor : 10 % left, 
  ammo : 2 rounds left in the assault rifle , half a mag left in the smg . 
  he comes round the corner again and i shoot him with the smg but i know i 'm a goner . 
  suddenly , boom !, 
  the grenade i 'd thrown earlier goes off while he was standing on it and he dies . 
  so i dust off my gloves and head off to a supply depot . 
  final score : 22:2 kdr , 1850 wp . 
  good game . 
  phew . 
  you can bridge a bomber for about 120k isk . 
  good for small , expensive cargo .

  as if that actually works . 
   teach kids how to really win at the pokies,

  oh , [ that thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteen_words ) . 
  anne frankly i would have more people get the jokes . 
  hats . 
  any . 
  just be careful with power consumption . 
  i had to recharge my ds3 on a separate use hub due to the larger power draw of mouse , keyboard plus head set . 
  ds3 is still great for vehicle piloting . 
  areas that tend to a natural monopoly ( such as water supply ) should n't be privatised ( or rather , the wholesaler should not be privatised , who cares who the retailer is ) . 
  areas that are n't natural monopolies ( such as banks ) you can safely spin off and just slap on some regulation to stop them being pricks . 
  so , the commonwealth bank spin-off was ok ; telstra was kinda-ok-maybe , and anything to do with utilities is generally a retarded idea and is basically only a cash-grab by macquarie bank or state government ( guess who gets the lion 's share of the money : hint not the government ), 
  something something health care . 
  probably best to look to failheap for fits than battleclinic . 
  amazing to think about , but telstra is way better now than they used to be . 
  banks are being bad due to not being called to account on mergers , which is due to accc not doing its job . 
  and yeah , privatising water is going to cause headaches in two or three years time , if history is any indication . 
  also , commentary would be nice . 
  at least demonstrate that you have read the full article . 
  they 're a post-pve community . 
  most of the posters do n't have any trouble with pve fits so they do n't make threads about it . 
  feel free to start one though . 
  that you do n't need to be subbed to enjoy eve . 
  it 's a lot less hassle to pilot . 
  no , you 're not . 
  definitely . 
  the recent brisbane meet had a good turn out . 
  http://dust514.info/ has a wiki you can put stuff on . 
  once you get 10 people in corp you can get a corp forum on the eve online forums .

  there is a type of repper with long range . 
  try using that . 
  yeah totally . 
  i was the bald guy . 
  you missed the one that happened last week , then . 
  lol yeah i live in brissie .

  also , she did try to stop him so she was n't merely bystanding . 
  i wish they 'd go back to their own country . 
  which time zone ? 
  so , who 's compiling a list of questions to ask ? 
  seems legit . 
  if you want to rezz me so much , why are n't you anywhere near me when i go down ? 
  i 'm going to pretend this is n't completely accurate :(, 
  it 's all fun and games until you actually implement the thing you joked about in the previous year 's april fools dev blog . 
  and that 's why we did n't have april fools dev blogs for two years . 
  it would help to provide details on, 
  * which region ( and thus , which rat type ) you will be shooting stuff in, 
  * what racial piloting/weapon skills you have . 
  not without comprehensive changes to in-game intel tools . 
  carbon stored in soil is good for plants ( technically , good for nitrogen-fixing bacteria ) . 
  [ biochar plants ] ( http://www.ruralweekly.com.au/news/mobile-biochar-plant-proves-its-worth-western-nsw-/1614601/ ) can take in waste material ( corn husks , nut shells etc ) , extract enough natural gas to power itself , and still produce useful charcoal for sequestration . 
  it 's energy-positive and carbon * negative * . 
  a few things, 
  your entire pocket has no security agents , so missions are out . 
  syndicate is pretty bad for ratting . 
  trust me . 
  i live there . 
  in fact , i 'm probably in bridge range to you , along with 15 % of / r/eve, 
  since you do n't need a huge tank to kill belt rats , you 're better off with something a bit lighter .
