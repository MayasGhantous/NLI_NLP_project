  something like this should be fine for belt ratting :,

  medium anti-kinetic screen reinforcer i, 
  medium anti-thermal screen reinforcer i, 
  medium projectile metastasis adjuster i, 
  just bear in mind you do n't have drones like a talos , so kill all tackle/webbing frigate rats first , probably while kiting them . 
  i was ratting in lowsec domain in my myrmidon when i got jumped by a curse . 
  it was my first battlecruiser ever . 
  `` oh shit '' i thought . 
  `` my first pvp fight and it 's against a tech 2 recon i 'm so dead crap did i insure my ship maybe i can escape nope scrammed '', 
  so i assigned drones and plinked away with my guns which were missing all the time because i had no gunnery support skills . 
  within 30 seconds , i was out of cap and a sitting duck . 
  then i realised that the curse could n't break my passive shield tank . 
  i mean , who passive shield tanks a myrmidon in amarr space ? 
  * this guy . 
  after a few minutes of drone micro-management , i got him down to 1/3 armor and he warped off . 
  victory !, 
  pretty much . 
  if you are a primary producer ( i.e. 
  starting at p0 ) then it 's all profit . 
  if you 're a processor , then you need to check your spreadsheets every few days in case you 're no longer making money . 
  that [ does n't look accurate ] ( http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.aspx?doc=/content/12333.htm ) for australia :, 
  * ** $ 180,001 ** and over : pay $ 54,547 plus 45c for each $ 1 over $ 180,000, 
  ( plus [ medicare levy ] ( http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm ) of 0 % -1.5 % ), 
  sure . 
  maybe he plexed it ? 
  then he already knows how to make isk . 
  truly , is there nothing that spreadsheets can not do ? 
  all hail the spreadsheet . 
   there 's no real way for a corporation to let you get started without also letting you take all their stuff . 
  technically , you can ; you just have to limit your corp to seven industry characters : /, 
  it would melt under the fire of a typical level four mission . 
  you might be able to use it as a sniper but it will still be a bit risky compared to putting it in a battleship and running a remote rep pair . 
  ravens are a lot bigger than a tornado and are thus easier to hit by large turrets, 
  gank tornadoes do high dps at short range ; ravens do medium dps at long range, 
  belt ratting does n't need much tank compared to level 4 missions , so attributes such as align time matter more . 
  your karma is that low ? 
  does csv and xml count ? 
  do n't blame me ; i voted for kodos . 
  then it must be reported , or they will continue to do it to the next person :(, 
  quantity is not everything . 
  you must play eve online . 
   also jump freighters are t2 capitals i believe . 
  they are . 
  they require invention , and need capital versions of the t2 components that go into normal t2 items . 
  a mittani breakdown - is that like a * downfall * video ? 
  he got better . 
  mordu 's legion invents dust cloning, 
  flawed dust 514 clone technology proliferates around the new eden cluster, 
  caldari executor is paranoid , but happens to be right about dust clones, 
  fighting breaks out everywhere ground side, 
  gallente federation tries to capitalise on the unrest by annexing caldari prime, 
  galfed wins space superiority and blow up titan , caldari dustbunnies win ground war, 
  both sides declare truce, 
  mordu 's legion become un peacekeepers of caldari prime ( and the dust mercs stuck on it ) , * just as planned * ^ tm, 
  no need for a pod .

  have to considered mining lyavite in incursion sites , then selling it via contract ? 
  i have no idea , but surely it has to be more interesting than belt mining . 
  that pisses him off even more . 
  i am a member of the upvote cartel . 
  i am not a pirate ; i am a * business man * . 
  what would you do in nullsec that you ca n't do in highsec ? 
  so , fly into venal , stain , outer ring or wherever , and do nomadic exploration . 
  it 's pretty neat . 
  as a bonus , you can scan down wormholes to get back to highsec with your loot . 
  i used to rat a lot , until the grind got to me . 
  every ship i lost was a blow , since it took me x hours of shooting plus signs to recoup , and i was rapidly getting jack of the whole cycle . 
  then i read about the [ philosophy of passive income ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-philosophy-of-passive-income/ ) . 
  ( ** tldr : ** if the isk took no effort to make , then you are n't sad when it disappears in a killmail ), 
  i had to downsize my pvp ambitions to suit my reduced income , but now i do n't have regrets about occasionally wasting it on random crap like bhaalgorns because it 's all profit . 
  ironically , i now have more isk than ever . 
  if they were deprived , they would die . 
  privation implies scarcity . 
  deprivation implies absence . 
  pepper spray for everyone !, 
  outer ring is ore-controlled space , so you can dock at any of the stations . 
  sk has a government department specifically set up to plan for reunification . 
  technically , since venal and stain are the home regions of the guristas and sansha , the rats there are very high quality , regardless of true sec status . 
  50 % of the price of the ship he 's most likely to fly in . 
  no ^ ( r ) way !,
