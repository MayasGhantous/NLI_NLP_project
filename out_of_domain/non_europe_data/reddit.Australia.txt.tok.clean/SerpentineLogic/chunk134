  yes . 
  ccp has to think about the long-term impacts of ancient characters playing in the same game as 1m sp semi-noobs . 
  if the veteran could apply all 40m sp towards his current fit , the rest of the team has little chance against him . 
  however , by doing stuff like splitting dropsuit and vehicle support skills up , narrowing certain skills to only apply to one weapon at a time , and making it so that dropsuit skills apply to fewer suits at a time , it allows a new character to rapidly reach parity with a veteran , since a veteran could only bring a fraction of his total sp to bear at any one time . 
  this seems logical to me . 
  in that case , the * the raincoat corporation *, 
  that 's not making light of rape , it 's making it seem acceptable which is actually * part * of rape culture . 
  outer ring is pretty empty . 
  could be worse ; he could be reposting poetic stanziel . 
  i bet he makes great dub step ^ *, 
  \\* assuming great dub step exists . 
  https://twitter.com/laurieoakes is a famous australian political commentator . 
  that paint job is alpha as fuck . 
  i 'd post it directly to his blog then . 
  [ meanwhile in america ... ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/600x1084xthe-end-of-america.jpg.pagespeed.ic.yeozhbtzq_.jpg ), 
  any plans to attach notifications to job completion ? 
  i 've been stockpiling ; i 'll manage . 
  hostile much ? 
  i 'm unconvinced . 
  there was a fair bit of that in the howard era . 
  except the commonwealth bank , which has done okay since privatisation . 
  the snowy mountain scheme cost a huge amount too , but it was worth it . 
  if all you want to do is salvage , [ there 's a corp for that ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/salvaging-service-theres-a-corp-for-that/ ) . 
  like i said ; i 'm unconvinced that a future liberal government will be substantially different from the howard one in regards to authoritarian policies . 
  but then you would n't be able to read the comment from its ceo . 
  it 's a web app , so you can . 
  eve is breaking records for active subscribers and player count . 
  they are obviously doing something right lately . 
  8 hours too late kane :o, 
  strategically appropriate . 
  a big-ticket item is much-needed - there must be one expansion per year with a big ` wow ! ', 
  factor to bring in new players and bring back vets . 
  ship balancing reduces the pain of existing players but is pretty hard to hook a new player on . 
  yes , i know that boring things have to be done to set up the next : awesome : feature , but it 's generally good practice to have a backlog of ` easy but flashy ' stuff that can be sprinkled on top of even the most boring expansion to tide people over . 
  stuff like autopilot-lines or show-your-market-orders go a long way towards making an average expansion into a good one . 
  tactically : too soon to tell . 
  not enough is known of the details to make a call . 
  possibly , but they would have churned away by now . 
  eve is hard on casual players . 
  is it a bpo or a bpc ? 
  if it 's a bpc and there are none on market , i usually ask corp mates . 
  then i ignore them and stash it away in a container until i forget about it anyway . 
  did someone actually * believe * that ? 
  anyone who even * signs up * for organ donation should get priority if they later need an organ from someone else . 
  note that the module they 're adding actually borrows its code from customs offices , not other pos modules ... 
  post fits in text format ? 
  `` never explain . 
  never apologise . '', 
  anything by lustmord . 
  collateral should be set to whatever you 'd be happy selling it for . 
  generally jita sell price is sufficient for stuff you were planning on selling anyway . 
  add 10-20 % margin if you would rather it get to its destination . 
  reward can be whatever you think you can get away with . 
  i 've managed to get packages moved for 50k/jump . 
  according to [ push industries ] ( http://www.pushx.net/quote.php ) , the going rate for a full freighter load is 450k/jump . 
  if you want cheaper than that , you 'll have to decide how much you can low-ball people before they decide it is n't worth it . 
  contact each corp on an alt , asking them to pull it down ( offer up to 50 % of what it would cost to wardec them ), 
  if they do n't want to pull them down , use the alt to wardec them . 
  if they do n't pull them down even under an active wardec , then you 'll need to * take steps * . 
  if you are willing to pay push rates , you might as well contract it to them , since their delivery rate is really , really fast . 
  exploration is a fairly solo pursuit . 
  have you considered a w-space corporation instead ? 
  you can be the adorable newbie that they leave behind in k-space when the hole becomes unstable . 
  maybe that did n't sell the concept the way i intended . 
  actually , when i said ` take steps ' , i meant [ aerobics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/step_aerobics ) , but your idea sounds a lot better . 
  if you 're looking for e-honourable w-space corps , you probably should have started with [ talocan united ] ( http://talocanunited.com/wordpress/alliance-rules/ ) . 
  so , do n't put stuff in corp that you 're not willing to lose ? 
  you 'll get personal hangar bays in odyssey anyway if you have trust issues . 
  might as well go for a wardec then . 
  this is why i play assault suits . 
  having a sidearm has saved my butt so many times when my habitually-inaccurate firing means i run out of ammo on my rifle . 
  they 're closely related to the famous long pork roll . 
  alliance activity [ seems healthy ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/new_eden_research./events ) tho . 
  call it `` career agent '' . 
  you say this like it 's a bad thing . 
  maybe i should ask for help logging in , then . 
  aura says i 'm fine for the next 17 days . 
  i 'll use the time to psych myself up . 
  well , there 's sadistica over in aridia . 
  [ sadistica ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sadistica+alliance&amp;l=1 ) . 
  all . 
  the . 
  time . 
  industry manufacturing slots are still too damn cheap . 
  ships can be pretty bulky for their price . 
  you will probably need to factor in freight costs . 
  i do buy cheap ships on occasion , but generally i reprocess them into minerals and sell/transport that instead . 
  slots already have congestion-based fees , but honestly the diference between 433k isk per hour and 999 isk per hour is negligible . 
  if slot fees scaled the way office rental does , then you 'd see a lot more stuff being hauled around , and a lot more impetus to sneak into lowsec for some cheap ~ ~ thrills ~ ~ manufacturing . 
  i think we all missed something . 
  best looking freighter tho . 
  it 's fairly easy to get to 99.5 % efficiency for scrapmetal processing . 
  let us consider the [ sigil ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=19744 ) . 
  amarr prices are 729,999.97 sell . 
  highest buy is 614,000.00 , but we 're mostly looking to buy in a newbie system :, 
  * 505,000.01 in conoban, 
  * 500,000.08 in deepari, 
  * 460,000.10 in pasha, 
  actual cost to build a sigil is a minimum of 701k isk , so you can see how it 's better to buy than to build , and also means even with imperfect refining you can still make a profit if you turn them into minerals . 
  if you want to haul those sigils , you will only be able to fit 45 per freighter load .
