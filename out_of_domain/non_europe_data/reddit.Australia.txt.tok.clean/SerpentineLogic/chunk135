  assuming you buy for 500k and sell for 800k in jita , you 're moving an entire freighter load for a measly 13.5 m isk profit so bear that in mind before you buy your freighter .

  well , you got some thinking to do . 
  personally i 'd grit my teeth and vote labor on preferences , but i respect that it 's a very difficult decision to make when both parties have fundamental and catastrophic flaws in their policies . 
  i think that each race will get a ship that handles, 
  * small gang, 
  * large fleets, 
  so just choose the solo one . 
  you 'd think they 'd goebbel it up .

  just undock from the station where you store your fuel and warp to the tower to refuel it . 
  what did you think of prometheus ' comments ? 
  i think it 's worth spending a bit of isk to enable you to keep your blueprints in a station ...

  technically , you 're not paying for * just * their r&d . you 're also paying for the huge medical advertising budgets that other countries [ regulate against ] ( http://www.tga.gov.au/industry/advertising-regulation.htm ) . 
  new zealand and the usa are the only two countries in the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) that allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines .

  priorities ... 
  my advice is to keep industry and non-industry skills on separate characters , barring the basics . 
  often , combat characters end up with negative security status , which precludes them from some sections of high-sec . 
  in addition , aside from fitting skills , there is n't really a lot of overlap between combat and industry skill sets . 
  thirdly , industrial work generally ties you to a base of operations ; that 's where your resources are , where you make stuff from them , and where you pack them into a hauler and deliver them to market . 
  combat characters , on the other hand , often move around the cluster following incursions , or corporate wars , or redeploying to far-off theatres for away campaigns . 
  this makes it really difficult to pop back to base and run some more jobs .

  i taught my kids a few signs when they were a couple months old . 
  they really only used a handful of them , but it reduces a lot of the frustration on both sides when a baby can communicate hunger vs all the other things that they could be upset about . 
  mf tachyons are cap stable with a cap power relay + t2 elutriation rig + t1 ccc rig but you 'll need a rcu ii + acr rig to fit everything .

  i 'm not going to copypaste the entire thing , but for those who ca n't wait :, 
   the brutix navy issue is a combat battlecruiser designed for brutal close-range fighting . 
   ** traits **, 
   gallente battlecruiser skill bonus per level :, 
   10 % bonus to medium hybrid turret damage, 
   7.5 % bonus to medium hybrid turret tracking speed, 
   can fit warfare link modules, 
   ** development **, 
   this ship was born out of the experience gained by the federation after the launch of the talos-class attack battlecruiser . 
  sensing that the brutix hull could be refined further , it was decided to remove all notion of active defense from it to favor improvements to its already significant damage potential . 
  the final outcome of this experiment resulted in the brutix navy issue , a vessel that already shows great potential from the few skirmishes it has been into so far . 
   the drake navy issue is a combat battlecruiser designed as a durable missile platform . 
   ** traits **, 
   caldari battlecruiser skill bonus per level :, 
   10 % bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile velocity, 
   5 % bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile explosion radius per level, 
   can fit warfare link modules, 
   ** development **, 
   after the resounding success tied to the launch of the drake-class battlecruiser , the caldari navy signed up a massive order to acquire a specific version for its own arsenals . 
  the outcome , the drake navy issue , while sharing a similar look with its step-father , serves a completely different purpose on the battlefield . 
  being more mobile , able to project missiles more effectively at range , against smaller targets and on a wider selection of damage types , this ship is ideal to support small scale conflicts and raids . 
   the harbinger navy issue is a combat battlecruiser designed as a lethal laser platform . 
   ** traits **, 
   amarr battlecruiser skill bonus per level :, 
   7.5 % bonus to medium energy weapon tracking speed, 
   10 % bonus to medium energy weapon damage, 
   can fit warfare link modules, 
   ** development **, 
   while the harbinger is a formidable vessel on its own , recent reports have raised its lack of flexibility as a noteworthy concern in the ever-shifting fleet tactic doctrines . 
  working hard to correct this problem , imperial engineers came up with the improved navy issue variant . 
  boasting upgraded tracking systems , enhanced resilience and an advanced medium slot configuration layout , the harbinger navy issue is a radical change over its predecessor , capable of astounding performance in a much wider spectrum of engagements . 
   the hurricane fleet issue is a combat battlecruiser designed for versatility in battle . 
   ** traits **, 
   minmatar battlecruiser skill bonus per level :, 
   5 % bonus to medium projectile turret damage, 
   5 % bonus to medium projectile turret rate of fire, 
   can fit warfare link modules, 
   ** development **, 
   in yc 115 , after much heated discussion , concord issued a decree stating the hurricane-class battlecruiser was far too effective to stay under its current technological label , and demanded the minmatar republic to either cease production or sort it as a more technologically advanced craft . 
  the tribal council grudgingly complied by releasing a simplified version of the hurricane , then quickly exploited a loophole in the legislation and began using the original overpowered hull as part of its active fleet force . 
  and that is how , after a new paint coat and renaming fees that the hurricane fleet issue came to be . 
  sarmatiko never releases price-related stuff . 
  minmatar because of vindicator and machariel .

  i love podla drakes , but they do n't work vs a talos . 
  that is the worst pickup line ever . 
  in a meta filled with tier 3 battle cruisers , a podla drake just does n't have the staying power . 
  use courier contracts , because you evidently ca n't manage it yourself . 
  and frankly , any sov null alliance will tell you to drop corp and join as individuals . 
  as a non american , that does n't happen to me .

  they pay for it from the savings they make on university fees ... 
  when i see a blog like that , it usually means op is already prepared to cash in on the mineral spike he plans to generate . 
  depends on the ship class . 
  tldr ; i have done the math .
