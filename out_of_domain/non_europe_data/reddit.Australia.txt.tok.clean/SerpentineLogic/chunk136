  winsaucerer has done the math . 
  now it 's time for you to do the math . 
  / r/straya , cunts .

  no daylight savings . 
  you can always ease into this whole ` eve ' thing by joining brave newbies or fweddit . 
  if you ca n't handle the shitposting there , you wo n't survive dreddit . 
  if push comes to shove , delete all game content and redownload it . 
  i had to do this once . 
  even apex predators have a nopenopenope instinct . 
  oh , you . 
  hopefully , that person learned a valuable lesson about risk and eggs and baskets . 
  it 's a lot better to be burned in internet spaceships than to lose your 401k . 
  [ not always ] ( http://themittani.com/news/weekend-aridia ) . 
  in [ march ] ( http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/regional-round-up-march-madness.html ) , the least killmail-generating regions were omist , cobalt edge , fade and malpais . 
  say you have a drug that cures tetanus . 
  after 20 years , it 's out of patent . 
  waht do ? 
  turns out that the drug requires calcium to do its job . 
  for most people , that is n't an issue , but hey , we 'll call them the 99 % . 
  solution : make a pill with active ingredient + 500mg of calcium to make damn sure the patient has enough calcium . 
  then you can patent it and away you go for another 20 years . 
  apparently , you can then sue them for selling ' a trivial modification ' of your newly-patented drug . 
  i 'm not sure how that works , but it obviously works often enough that evergreening is worth it . 
  tldr ; lawyers . 
  the trick is to [ keep ` innovating ' ] ( http://donttradeourlivesaway.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/article-from-washington-post-citing-example-of-evergreening-tactics-used-by-mncs-to-continue-monopoly/ ) faster than you can be called to account . 
  it 's even better if you 're watching a movie . 
  imperial navy slicers are * somewhat * good at kiting ... 
  / r/dust514, 
  having said that , piloting drop ships is pretty awesome if you like flying . 
  the next patch will have gunships as well , so you can shoot stuff instead of being a taxi driver . 
  is there a fast way to use the map for targeting on a kb ? 
  type 1 logistics suits have three equipment slots . 
  is the basic plate really worth it when you can fit a regulator instead ? 
  fair enough . 
  note that shield regulators only cost 10 % more cpu than an equivalent plate . 
  oh , i think redditors are stranger than most . 
  he plays dust ; he should already have a corp. 
  just pretend i did n't make a typo in the title . 
  http://fleet-up.com has one . 
  having just eaten avocado on toast , sprinkled with salt and pepper , i can confirm this . 
   ef-f36 -- syndicate ninja unicorns ganks ragnarok, 
   ninja unicorns with huge horns v al3xand3r, 
   so a kind gentle soul from usurper chats me saying one of their carriers is being camped in at ef-f36 station and that a hostile ragnarok from al3xand3r is pretty keen to jump in and doomsday said carrier , we know this from a usurper dude that has a alt in the titan 's alliance . 
  so these al3xand3r folk seem to have eyes several jumps out of the ef-f36 system and the gentle folk from usurper ca n't sneak any hics in without being seen , having no active horn titans anymore and mine having been blow-up in a glorious fireball i quickly scramble horn dreads asap and several ghotsriders for this titan gank within 5 minutes 20 horn members have fleeted up , caps having jumped to a midpoint and subcaps burning through sling bubbled syndicate !, 
   usurper undock their carrier and with a their al3xand3r spy light the cyno for the ragnarok well above station to doomsday the tank fit carrier . 
  ninja unicorns jump in as the titan lands and ghotoriders achieve tackle . 
  unending fate in his new ragnarok being a sporting fellow kindly doomsdays my alt 's moros and accepts his fate . 
   `` unending fate  gj lads '', 
   http://kb.ninja-unicorns.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=28516 -- moros death, 
   halfway through the majestic beasts shields a al3xand3r cyno lights up 30km away to little effect ... . nothing jumps through and the titan is eventually destroyed with a fair number of hostile subcaps buzzing about . 
   http://kb.ninja-unicorns.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=28513 - ragnarok, 
   nothing special or cool just a standard gank but that 's pretty much what happened incase people wanted to know .

  which timezone ? 
  * amplification node : +50 % self-rep , 2 mid slots, 
  * adaptive shielding : +25 resists , 1 high + 1 mid slot, 
  * supplemental screening : +50 % shield hp , 2 mid slots, 
  if you 're running missions , the amplification node is the best choice . 
  unless you 're doing something terribly wrong ( or terribly right in a very narrow role ) , you should n't passive tank a tengu . 
  well , considering you have an extra mid slot with an amp node , it 's pretty easy to work out that it will provide a better tank .

  what 's the deal with refused classification ? 
  under the old old * old * system , anything not classified was ok , which is ironic since it was called the censorship board in those days . 
  now it 's the classification board , but does censorship too .
