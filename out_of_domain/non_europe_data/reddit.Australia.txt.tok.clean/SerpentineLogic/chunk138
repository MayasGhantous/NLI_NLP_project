  edit : also chribba would be a lot happier if he could plug more stuff into dustboard, 
  what is a refrigerator mom ? 
  aw yiss [ . 
  ] ( http://drawception.com/pub/panels/2012/9-17/8zxsz38ade-2.png ), 
  come uprising , you 'll have a deployable shield to hide under , 
  assuage level : julian, 
  like eve board , but for dust characters . 
  without crest it 's somewhat lacking . 
  suddenly , courier contract prices spike . 
  officer fit state raven would get higher . 
  as if you did n't know what was going to happen ... 
  we have light vehicles and heavy vehicles , and light turrets and heavy turrets . 
  when will we get medium vehicles and turrets ? 
  and what about afk farmer farming ? 
  like , with grenades ? 
  they 're not bad from behind . 
  giev squad finder prease :(, 
  combo that with a jump-pack . 
  ccp 's approach can be summed up as :, 
  `` let 's just take the warning labels off everything and let the chips fall where they may . '', 
  nice !, 
   getting more than one squad into the same instant battle and on the same team is not really possible, 
  except in au timezone , where it happens all the time . 
  on the plus side , i have become quite adept at shooting corpmates when they turn up on the * other * side . 
  also toula from * fat pizza * , which you must be australian to understand . 
  i 'll allow it . 
  yes and no . 
  it increases supply , which will put a downward pressure on prices . 
  this is especially important for anything that requires tags , since often the prices are determined more by random tag drop than the lp used to access the offer . 
  i 'm not surprised in the least . 
  if you 've ever used ap0 you 'd know how freaking awesome it was . 
  he is the steve irwin of pygmies . 
  it 's easier than that . 
  there 's a function call somewhere that the eve client uses to warp to ( e.g. 
  when you rightclick warp to -  10km it puts 10km into the function ), 
  there 's also a constant that autopilot uses , eg you click `` autopilot '' but the eve client sends warpto ( next_stargate , autopilot_distance ) . 
  so the ap0 hack finds the autopilot_distance constant , then changes it from 15km to 0km . 
  my wife is still annoyed that the overrun deck i posted to her during tempest block was lost in the mail . 
  this would be a stronger argument if warping to zero took any skill at all . 
  only if they are russian . 
  not many corps troll a director so much he steals 200m isk and rage quits , though . 
  tuskers do n't post in the syndicate thread , so they ca n't be * that * bad ... 
  there 's [ three ] ( http://dialectblog.com/2011/07/10/types-of-australian-accents/ ) major accents . 
  the accent differences between social classes is greater than regional differences though . 
  we 're talking about poutine [ iff ] tags on meme posts , like / r/canada . 
  if it 's a macro , chances are it 's also a meme , or else it would n't be popular enough to have a macro made of it . 
  pre-game ready room or nothin ' . 
  buffing militia suit base ehp but nerfing the number of slots and/or fitting might be a good idea . 
  newbs do n't have the skill points invested to make proper use of each slot , so fewer slots wo n't hinder them as much in practice as lower base shield and armour do . 
  there are militia forge guns ; just not hmgs . 
  which is fair , since there 's also no militia lasers , mass drivers or other weapons . 
  which reminds me ; any news about alternative merc packs ? 
  you 're wasting an opportunity , 
  here 's one i [ whipped up earlier ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sslq3z5dbsk ) . 
  one problem with private sales not being checked is that you end up with a lot of [ straw purchases ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_purchase#firearms ) . 
  it 's like kfc , except without the boring bits . 
  try sorting by best . 
  what was the result ? 
  what salvage did you get ? 
  no question , but please tell the devs that the weekly feedback and bug fix threads are pure gold and they should be proud of the level of feedback they go to . 
  would be better if we saw the story cards they complete each sprint , but that 's probably commercially sensitive anyway . 
  bombs were before that . 
  not even with afterburner ? 
  how else would you get on top of your mcc ? 
  ( aside from the southern mcc on manus peak skirmish which you can just fly up to ), 
   i 'd like to think that i 'm voting for a party , not for the person at the front of it . 
  that has n't been true since keating . 
  the second burn jita should * also * be better than the first . 
  sidearm : your choice . 
  i prefer smg , because i ca n't aim . 
  equipment slot : i like a nanohive , preferably a compact one so it can repair armor ( i usually have profile dampeners in the low slots ), 
  also :, 
   dear players ,, 
   dust 514 community team will be attending fanfest 2013 the next week followed by holidays until may 6th so there will be an hiatus on the weekly updates until may 9th . 
  we will resume the weekly updates around that time . 
  thank you . 
  also the last round of feedback until after uprising . 
  smgs seem to have much better range when scoped . 
  or perhaps weapon spread is lower so more rounds get on target at the same range . 
  i get smg kills all the time . 
  generally i assault rifle someone to death , but run out of magazine before i take down their friend and switch to smg to finish them off . 
  i read an article somewhere that said that the auto subsidies amounted to $ 70,000 per worker to not close down a particular auto plant . 
  i reckon the workers would have preferred to receive a bank deposit rather than have it go to their boss . 
  plus , it 'd stay in the local economy . 
  i use the free toxin smg from the merc pack . 
  it lacks a bit of punch , but then again i have n't put any skill points into making it better . 
  first fosters , now ken ham . 
  deportation : 2 , usa : 0, 
  fair enough . 
  passive skill point accrual means you can easily shelve the game for a few months without penalty . 
  i think most mmos would be happy to be ' [ on its death bed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/macgwkt.jpg ) ' the way wow is . 
  you get 24k per day anyway so it 's not a huge loss . 
  better than the cook having to single-handledly fight mercenaries trying to hijack the ship . 
  although that birthday cake * was * delicious ... 
  and that book would involve sparkly vampires . 
  the sacul of life . 
  [ yes there is ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=34701 ) , and all the cool kids are in it . 
  there 's a lot of corp mates who only do corp squads vov . 
  i 've seen that video . 
  i think you accidentally tweeted .
