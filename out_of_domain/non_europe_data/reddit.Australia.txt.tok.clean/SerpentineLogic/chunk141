  it 's a traditional art style , but only for certain traditional cultures in australia . 
  i 'm not sure why it has spread to practically all of australia ; perhaps because buyers expect it , just like british punters expect their curries to be particular colour so indian restaurants mix in food dye because their patrons do n't believe that their authentic dishes are authentic * enough * . 
  not at launch , but yes , hordes of drones to kill like in the matrix . 
  tell me more ; how does it relate to the dots ? 
  i would bet september , assuming a 3-month release cycle . 
  some people have ten year 's experience . 
  others have one year , repeated ten times . 
  even in countries nominally on ` your side ' . 
  and yet , vietnam invaded cambodia , toppled pol pot then gave them independence again once the political situation stabilised . 
  perhaps they learned a better way to deliver freedom by not repeating the mistakes made when they were the recipient ... 
  and even then , they change it to something stupid like caldari citizen 23678462 , so as to not to encourage them . 
  about 2 expansions ago . 
  we 're still waiting . 
  that 's because those suits do n't exist in game yet so they want to show them off . 
  not so sure about that ; my receipt already has unlock codes in it . 
  hit up mike devoid on failheap . 
  he was in the tournament . 
  at my university , engineers are banned from logic 101 because the philosophy lecturers do n't want to see boolean algebra when they mark exams . 
  also they tended to skew the bell curve for the arts majors . 
  why would it ? 
  most of the population of nullsec is within two jumps of torrinos anyway . 
  jump freight cost is only a couple hundred isk per m ^ 3 so it wo n't break the bank even if prices double . 
  conversely , non-miserable employees directly foster an atmosphere conducive to high-end shoppers . 
  i joined east khanid trading when i was a wee noob . 
  a bunch of massive carebears but their hearts are in the right place . 
  generally , the fastest freighter is the best , since it 's very rare that the small extra cargo capacity can be utilized effectively . 
  meh , syndicate is ok . you basically know where everyone else lives , so if you decide to fly to ired space to pick a fight , you know what you 're going to get ( a fight . 
  also 30 % guardians ), 
  a recent australian university study showed that the same r\u00e9sum\u00e9s had wildly different rates of getting to the interview stage , based on whether the applicant had an anglo vs indian name . 
  a different study showed that skin colour made a sizeable difference about whether a bus driver would let you get on a bus when your e-ticket was n't working ( caveat : wearing a suit or a military uniform largely negated this ), 
  maybe two wrongs do n't make a right , but helping someone up who has been pushed down is a different matter . 
  any chance you could put ` cont ' d or start the posts with 2/3 or something if the blog spans multiple posts ? 
  no , they 're all free . 
  i think a more nuanced phrase is `` maybe it 's inequitable but it 's necessary . '', 
  :18 months :, 
  the official word is it 's permanent . 
  to stop no lifers gaining 50 million skill points on launch day and stomping everyone . 
  active points are meant to be a perk , not a grind to keep up . 
  too subtle ? 
  feel free to hit up the mods for a ccp flair ... 
  i think it looks a lot more sturdy , as befitting an armor tanked battleship . 
  geez , this ` gamification ' thing has really taken off . 
  by that definition , memes are perilously close to being life forms . 
  you ca n't make this shit * up * . 
  eve [ already has ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72069/1751968-650px_ccp_games___eve_chronicles___tibus_heth_caldari_pilot___fd_02.jpg ) mechs . 
  they 'll likely turn up in dust 514 eventually . 
  i should probably make an alt . 
  i could call it serpentine logi . 
  the problem with going logistics is that i 'm a lot better at assault so i feel like i 'm weakening the team by reviving people who go on to get 0/15 when i could have been doing 15/0 instead . 
  tibus heth being a badass as per usual . 
  the best thing about having low standards is that i live my life surrounded by beautiful women . 
  op has some serious pedigree when it comes to nullsec mining . 
  good post . 
  nope . 
  they also have a couple of good dust corporations , although fewer than they used to . 
  hmm , looks like they have # 4 , # 12 , # 17 , # 21 , # 24 and # 25 in the leaderboard so i guess that adds up . 
  technically , salute is o7, 
  warm regards ,,

   i am a crafting fanatic , it has to be present for me to even consider playing . 
  i 've read online that the only game with better crafting was sw : g . if so , why is this ? 
  as an example : see [ how to make tech 3 stuff ] ( http://www.eve-guides.com/ui/tech3.php ) . 
  you have elements of exploration , resource-gathering , manufacturing , market research , * actual * research and procurement from market just to make these things . 
  you do n't buy stuff from npcs ; you buy them from players . 
  you do n't sell them to npcs ; you sell them to players . 
  and at each step of the chain , you need to determine whether you 're competitive with everyone else who 's doing it , because manufacturing is the easy part ; it 's making money from it that 's the challenge . 
  ** industry is pvp combat ** with your wallet being your hit points . 
   on steam it says players can eventually pay for their sub fees through in game money . 
  is this common ? 
  yes . 
  most players who are n't actively terrible at making money usually have assets they can liquidate for at least a year 's worth of game time . 
  heck , i have six months worth just sitting in my hangar and i * am * actively terrible at making isk . 
  having said that , if you 're grinding isk just to pay for your subscription , that 's a bad thing and you should reassess your pastime ( or , like , mow lawns for your subscription instead of slaving away for 50c an hour mining space rocks ) . 
  if , however , you 're doing stuff you genuinely enjoy , and isk happens to fall into your wallet from said activity , then that 's acceptable .

  [ this rss feed ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=rsstopic&amp;pg=search&amp;forumid=898&amp;devbadge=1&amp;gmbadge=1 ) . 
  i like it . 
  this is a good way to launch . 
  there is n't a specialized class for this yet , but a logi would probably be the best fit at the moment ; you can rep up your vehicle , and use its enhanced mobility to drop uplinks and nanohives for your squad mates then get back in and drive off . 
  i learned about the pirate ship log thing a [ couple days ago ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/today-i-learned-about-pirate-ship-logs/ ) and it sounds like a really promising idea . 
  in cantonese , it 's fa muk lan . 
  nice work !, 
  choosing a side is great for live events as well . 
  any news on the uprising info dump ? 
  a few hundred thousand of us have skill point allocations to plan ,
