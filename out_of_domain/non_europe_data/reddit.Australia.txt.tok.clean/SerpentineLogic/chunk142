  i know ; i currently work for an airline . 
  however , non-gds airlines ( in particular ) have significant leeway in their pricing model , and online sales channels offer a lot more context to base pricing decisions on . 
  i personally think that very few airlines worldwide have the capability to adjust online prices based on such personalised rules , but if i were to pick two airlines who would be most likely , it would be easy jet and ryanair .

   hello folks ,, 
   we have long term plans to improve certificates as a whole and we would appreciate your input regarding their public visibility . 
  at the moment it is possible to set individual certificates as public by going into your character sheet , under the certificates  permissions tab . 
   ** initial research has shown a low usage of characters set certificates as public , we thus are considering the following options : **, 
   * remove the ability to set certificates as public, 
   * offer the ability to drag and drop individual certificates , or a whole certificate profile from a character into any kind of text input field ( conversation channels or eve mails for instance -- this already is possible for individual certificates from the planner ), 
   * offer means to compare certificates with a particular individual that give you permission with your own, 
   * for bragging rights , display unlocked certificates publicly on all character show info , but do n't mention to which fields they apply -- for instance , running a show info on character a would list this pilot has 53 certificates to elite , 24 to standard , but do not allow me to know their names or related skills . 
   would you feel comfortable with any of these options ? 
  which ones do you like ? 
  options outside that list may be considered as well , if expressed in a constructive manner . 
   ** as another topic for you guys to voice your feedback to , what information would you feel worried about if it was displayed as public by default and why ? 
   in all cases , please note all of this remains high-level conceptual work that is in no way set in stone or even planned for the immediate future , which is why we are asking for your input in the first place . 
   many thanks for your time . 
  r&d . set jobs , play dust for a month . 
  dust is a tracking shooter . 
  your gun probably only does 300 dps , whereas most non-terrible suits have 500hp , so if you can put rounds on target for a couple seconds straight , you 're going to have a bad time . 
  also once you get a bit of experience under your belt , you can easily die eight times in a match and still make a profit , even while running non-basic gear . 
  well , there 's a few things you can do . 
  * research a blueprint , sell it on contracts . 
  can be high-volume for cheap stuff like catalysts , whereas stuff like capital components is higher margin , provided you can wait the three months it takes to research them . 
  * buy a blueprint , sell copies . 
  useful for filling up free production slots , but not really very lucrative unless you choose your blueprint well . 
  a max-run hobgoblin bpc retails at 150k isk , which is not really awesome isk per hour . 
  * make bpcs , do invention . 
  sites like eve-market-guide . com provide some indication about what to make , as does eveiskperhour . 
  a lot more effort than the previous options , but potentially a lot more lucrative . 
  also easier to lose money on if the market shifts . 
  alternatively , you can join an industrial corp. 
  some of them let you make whatever you want ; others will pay you isk to do stuff for them . 
  isk is earned based on time spent in the match , and contribution to the win i.e. 
  kills ( not deaths ) , war points accumulated etc. 
  item salvage is distributed semi-randomly based on the entire team 's performance , with each high-value kill providing a chance of semi-relevant salvage . 
  incidentally , you do n't need expensive suits to do well ; i often swan around in type-ii basic assault suits with a free assault rifle . 
  however , i use two very good shield extenders , which means i can survive incoming fire for long enough to take down my attacker ( or force them off ) . 
  tldr train for survivability first, 
  i assume you 've [ seen this ] ( / r/dust514/comments / 1do23z/dust _ 514_tutorial_videos_episode_1_character / ) already ?
