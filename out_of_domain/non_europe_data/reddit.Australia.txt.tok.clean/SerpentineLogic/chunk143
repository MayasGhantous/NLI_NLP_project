  thank you . 
   dust 514 development team, 
  which time zone ? 
   in something like java , i 'd multiply it and store as int, 
  yeah , no . 
  use bigdecimal , or if you 're serious , something from the joda money library . 
  we 're autz only , but maybe [ one of our foreign legions ] ( http://forums.riseoflegion.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=899 ) is more your style . 
   replacing all player , corporation and eve names with default names ? 
  `` hi mom , some guy called xxxcunt_destroyerxxx just invited me into his squad ! '', 
  i 'll likely be asleep by then . 
  good . 
  send me a skill plan while you 're at it because i still do n't know what to do . 
  still unable to reconnect . 
  ok that 's it i 'm going to bed . 
  you ** never ** go full metagame . 
  amarr logistics suit is awesome for carrying around light anti-tank weapons , since you have a sidearm and repair tool to cover other situations . 
  same thing , but no perks from the prototype-level skills . 
  which type are you using ? 
  actually some devs have acknowledged that the mouse controls are n't as good as previous build and will be fixing it . 
  germany has massive deposits ( like , half a euro for a 2l bottle ) and you do n't see recyclable litter * anywhere * ; all the poor people pick it up and deposit it themselves . 
  pretty much . 
  i actually meant the turret type , 
  who does n't have barbecue sets at work ? 
  how would they have bacon fridays without one ? 
  cooking 1.7 kg of bacon in a dinky office kitchen would take ages , not to mention the eggs . 
  so , is not just dream of potato in latvia ? 
  i 've worked at places where not only did the monthly parties have thousand-dollar bar tabs , they were * compulsory * . 
  the new zealand branch won the country 's best employer award eight years running ... 
  but yeah , i 'm probably trolling :-p, 
  i really enjoyed that erikson does n't do ` exposition exposition exposition ' in the standard way . 
  the characters in his books take things for granted that the reader does n't understand , and explain things to other characters that the reader only finds out later are completely incorrect or that one side has been blatantly lying the entire time . 
  there 's an apocryphal story about the three gorges dam . 
  obviously , when the dam was built , a lot of people would have to relocate out of the area due to be submerged . 
  a consultant asked how they could possibly move so many people out of their homes . 
  the chinese guy said `` oh , we 'll just send in a few hundred thousand troops . 
  no problem . '', 
  ( turns out china has [ almost 1.5 million soldiers ] ( http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china/china-officially-reveals-the-size-of-its-mammoth-army/article1-1045643.aspx ) , so it 's not as unbelievable as it seems ), 
  i believe the people responsible were later executed . 
  not so much fun if you 're not the guy giving the orders . 
  hopefully in a week 's time , those players will have more important things to do than pub matches . 
  personally , i prefer [ someone else 's retelling ] ( http://www.computerandvideogames.com/180867/features/murder-incorporated/ ) of the heist , but you ca n't go past the story in the original perpetrator 's own words . 
  bear in mind that uprising has some ... contentious aspects to it . 
  it 's understandable that a lot of people are slacking off until ccp fixes stuff and conducts more game balance . 
  i mean , there 's something a bit screwy when the caldari logistics suit is a better assault suit than the * actual * caldari assault . 
  you either like bbq , or you are * wrong * . 
  i 'd rather cap things by the cost of the fits . 
  instant-battle games would have a threat level , and you could only use fits that cost a certain amount ( vehicles would be double the cap ), 
  threat level : 50 would mean each fit would have to cost 50k or less , and each vehicle would cost < 100k ( this precludes tanks entirely ), 
  i do n't know if it 's the best way to do it , but it has its advantages . 
  now i literally ca n't hit anything any more . 
  there 's a greater than even chance i 'll stop playing if it 's made permanent . 
  edit : ah , this is why . 
  to be fair , a squad of players working as a team can demolish a pub match even using standard gear . 
  kbm, 
  try the cycled variant . 
  yes ; aryth and his mates pulled an easy 3 trillion each from the start of faction war . 
  meh , my t2 bpos are n't really more profitable per hour than invention . 
  it 's just convenient to schedule 500 runs and not have to login for a month , that 's all . 
  for some people , their personal wallet is how they keep score . 
  this is also true in eve . 
  i plan to run people over in lavs for a day or two . 
  any plans on updating dustboard 's skill list for uprising ? 
  you can help by curating * and prioritising * all the problems that people are complaining about , providing links to ccp responses so anyone who starts a new thread ` xxxx is broken ' can be sent a link with ` this is where your problem is being tracked , showing how it ranks in importance based on player feedback , and what ccp has said about this problem ' . 
  why bother ? 
  just buy a game time card , split into two plex and list them on the market . 
  instant billion isk , no risk of banning . 
  he 'll , there 's even discounts if you buy in bulk from gtc resellers , if you need to buy so many . 
  not raging until confirmation from a non-gm . 
  i could be more sensational , but this is n't / r/conspiracy . 
  if there were a web-accessible citation for the royal commission on drug trafficking 's findings , i 'd remove the ` probably ' , but it 's a bit difficult to find first-hand citations for something so old . 
  well , he * is * the author . 
  it 's still a poor article though . 
  i , too , would eat your own neck . 
  you 'd have to be 45 + to remember it , 
  you heard correctly , then . 
  technically , it has vk0 fitting and speed . 
  also less base ehp than the old vk1 . 
  [ done ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegemite ) . 
  just like the ' [ four guys in a bar ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/tricks-of-the-ad-trade/2008/05/25/1211653833808.html ) ' device . 
   just why do beer commercials , for example , feature four blokes enjoying their schooners ? 
  why not one guy sitting by himself ? 
   `` ah , that 's because one guy by himself is an alcoholic loner , '' anderson said . 
   `` two guys drinking together are gay , three apparently just looks wrong , but four ... four is a bunch of guys having a great time . '', 
  welp , there goes another 2 million skill points ... 
  baby do n't hurt me, 
  do n't hurt me, 
  no more . 
  if you 're not involved in planetary conquest , then a small corp does n't * have * to make money . 
  the individual members can handle their finances amongst themselves . 
  do stuff together , have a goal , make sure that memorable experiences are shared amongst the entire corp. 
  right now , donations are the only way to get isk into a corp. 
  but again , why do you want isk ? 
  just squad up , carry injectors , and join instant battles together and win the isk war .
