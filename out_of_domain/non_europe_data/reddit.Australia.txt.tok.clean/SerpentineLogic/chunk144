  it 's easier to organise a squad if you 're all on corp chat , and you can send corp mails without having to individually add everyone . 
  plus , when corp taxes come in , you can set your tax rate to whatever you want . 
  plus you all get to have a neat corp name , 
  planetary conquest is the taking and holding of territory for the corporation . 
  if you 're a small corp , you 're probably going to have a hard time ponying up the 80m isk required to get into pc , but if you can put together sixteen good players you can carve yourself a small niche . 
  faction warfare is just like instant battles , except you get to choose which battle and which side from a list of active factional warfare flash points . 
  the rewards are the same as for instant battles , but down the track , the idea is to reward players extra for consistently choosing a particular side ( and winning ) . 
  no , you can even do it solo . 
  he has also been banned from / r/pyongyang ~, 
  my second account is to give me options on which character to not log in with . 
  nope , you can purchase them from the mint . 
  so brave . 
  the mercenary pack will only be available until 5/14 , so if you do n't have those blueprints , it 's a very good idea to pick it up . 
  so , sp respec and some sp-prereq rollback is likely to happen . 
  nice . 
   the bare minimum the coalition is offering, 
  what the coalition 's plan is offering and what its plan can actually * deliver * are two very different things . 
  stats ? 
  good changes . 
  even better communication . 
  in some cases you can work out what the stats would be , based on the type code in the name . 
  for others , not a chance . 
  first i 've heard of it . 
  go find out . 
  depends what they mean by ` fresh ' . 
  commercially-available honey has been heat treated , which destroys some enzymes that exist in raw honey . 
  it 's still absolutely fine for eating , but if you are using it for medicinal purposes ( e.g. 
  burns treatment , or killing golden staph infections or whatever ) then it wo n't work very well . 
  i guess he was really sweet on her . 
  ccp posts eve stats all the time . 
  they just do n't post dust stats because they 're a different team and have n't learned the lessons of the burn jita era . 
  that 's incredibly short-sighted imo . 
  it 's like saying that unless you 're in a competitive league , you ca n't enjoy team fortress . 
   tl ; dr anywhere i can have fun playing the game without immature , annoying and offensive comms ? 
  compared to any corp full of redditors , anywhere else would be an improvement , i suspect . 
  oh , except for those retards from 4chan . 
   it 's an mmo . 
  it 's an fps with a skill point system , not an mmo . 
  it 's probably better if you forget it exists . 
  [ i do .

  do you have enough time ? 
  with one child , you should be okay . 
  with two , probably not . 
  are you willing to spend money instead of time ? 
  you have no time , so grinding for isk is not going to work out for you . 
  if you 're time poor , expect to drop some money on game time cards to turn into plex to fuel your pvp action ( probably ) . 
  so , decide whether to commit to spending more than your subscription , or whether to draw down on your existing in-game assets then unsub once you are broke . 
  watch a bunch of videos on ccp 's youtube channel . 
  are you still excited ? 
  maybe watch some alliance tournament coverage , just to check . 
  read the patch notes , starting from when you left . 
  pay particular attention to the crucible expansion , where ccp stopped working on world of darkness and threw a metric fuckton of developer hours towards fixing eve ( it needed it ) . 
  also , note how awesome each expansion has been since then . 
  resub an account and join faction warfare for a bit . 
  you can pvp in cheap ships , potentially earn a fair bit of loyalty points at the same time , and potentially get a lot of pvp action . 
  / r/fweddit is fairly large . 
  granted , it 's full of redditors , but do n't let that discourage you . 
  if not , then maybe just download dust 514 on your ps3 and play casually . 
  try changing your preferred server ? 
  i 'd go to * their * barbecue , if you know what i mean ... 
  there 's always going to be a small percentage of the workforce that is unemployable , either because they 're fuckwits or they 're witless . 
  economists have pegged that at about 3 percent of the workforce , so 5 percent is actually pretty good . 
  similarly , seven percent unemployment actually means that * twice * as many not useless people are out of work compared to five . 
  but then they have less competition for city jobs , since ` everyone ' is in a mining town . 
  maybe we should read more books . 
  i do n't think that you need to give players a suspect flag if they shoot rocks , even in highsec . 
  i think it 's entirely possible to scan people down from 16au + now . 
  `` mistakes were made '', 
   as a blockade runner , some people will take a chance on you and pop you, 
  in lowsec , * everyone * will take a chance and pop you . 
  just remember that it 's a squad-based shooter , so even on a scrub server , you can still get stomped by six noobs working together . 
  ( this is basically just a cut and paste from the forum post , except with images you can see ), 
  sun , i am disappoint . 
  that 's how it always seems to goeth ... 
  i think the fake sweeteners are added later . 
  just buy angostura bitters and make them yourself . 
  frankly , i could n't be arsed . 
  logging in as someone else is way out of line . 
  gms will ban you for life , and they 'll get all their stuff back anyway . 
  having said that , you could probably get them ( temporarily ) banned for account sharing , if you have evidence .

  fyi pancreatic cancer is a very fast-acting type . 
  if you 're diagnosed , you usually have about 6 weeks to live . 
  so , putting further stress on your pancreas is probably not a thing you should do . 
  he 'd probably say `` no , seriously , where 's your * phone * . '', 
  i think things have moved on from the great leap forward . 
  whatever has the best forum picture . 
  you guys getting into pc ? 
  aldrat is pretty close to molden heath . 
  / r/straya : not dumb , drunk and racist , but # 1 with dumbs , drunks and racists . 
  australians are really good at scientific wine-making . 
  their wines are usually not as good as a good french wine , but they never have bad wine ( except via winemakers ' bad decisions ), 
  so , much like watching question time ? 
  ** tldr ; ** unless you have serious manufacturing skills , just buy them . 
  each race is good ; each suit has a role where it excels , and others that it struggles in . 
  gallente suits tend to have lots of low slots , which means you tend to put some stiff armor and a repairer in , and not worry so much about seeking durability from your high slots ; maybe put some damage enhancers there instead . 
  alternatively , you can go with a shield tank and use your low slots for stuff like sensor boosting or mobility modules .
