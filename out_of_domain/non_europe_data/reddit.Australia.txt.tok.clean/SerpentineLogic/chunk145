  technically , since they 're out-of-game codes , you can only accept out-of-game stuff , like gtcs or whatever . 
  it 's probably worth more than a gtc , btw . 
  generally , any skill can be trained to iii without too much time investment , so if you see something that will help you out , go for it . 
  i think it depends on the type of engineering . 
  civil , mechanical , electrical ( power systems ) have large consequences of failure , and you tend to stick with what works because , well , fuck prototypes and the bedding-in they rode in on . 
  these guys tend to skew right , because `` stop fucking with shit , you 'll just break it more '', 
  environmental and software engineering is all about change , so they skew left , because `` this shit is fucked , let 's fix it , stop getting in my way '' . 
  engineers tend to look at things as black or white , because almost everything they deal with is verifiably right or wrong . 
  on the other hand , those in the arts and social sciences tend to not handle situations that there is a clearly defined right and wrong . 
  ** tldr ; ** people are n't good at stuff they do n't do every day . 
  congratulations on go-live , guys . 
  people hate the concept , but immigration avoids this process of raising a child , and skips straight to the bit where you decide you want to employ them . 
  plus , this way you can deport the arseholes , unlike the ones born here . 
  children are cheap if you neglect to spend money on them . 
  the baby bonus was a howard policy . 
  i. e. `` please have more white babies '', 
  \\  implying that only smart people are rich ... 
  australia does n't take in all that many immigrants , but those it takes in are much more stringently tested for holding a job than practically any other country , especially the usa . 
  conservatives like howard , and would defend his policies , regardless of how good they were . 
  according to opinion polls at the time , yeah . 
  he was pretty damn popular for almost a decade . 
  you missed out . 
  abbott is no howard . 
  then again , you also missed latham , so maybe it evens out . 
  isk not spent does not cause inflation . 
  in australia , they 're mandatory . 
  inglorious cunts . 
   when downtime ends in 30 mins we 're going to start dropping testies . 
  good to see you guys finally experiencing puberty . 
  hep metabolic enhancer . 
  redemption screen is nicer , too . 
  how can you be the power behind the throne if you 're sitting on it ? 
  vehicles are fine with a ds3 , or even preferred . 
  i prefer kbm for infantry work , and i 'm happy to say that ccp has unfucked the mouse controls in today 's patch . 
  no velcro any more . 
  my mouse works fine on 90 % sensitivity . 
  pretty-much all the dust devs , i imagine . 
  [ a common complaint . 
  perhaps he was more of a neocon . 
  they handle like tactical assault rifles . 
  * single-shot, 
  * scope ( not huge zoom , but not terrible ), 
  * can be hip-fired effectively ( i went 4/1 when duelling ), 
  * heat buildup means you 'll only get a dozen rapid-fire shots in before it overheats - amarr suits will make a big difference here, 
  * holding down fire allows you to charge up . 
  you can walk while charged , but ca n't jump or run . 
  the charged shot is pretty nice ; you can take a huge chunk off someone 's shields but it costs you about 80 % heat, 
  * magazine holds 45 rounds with ~ 180 rounds in reserve . 
  you wo n't run out in a hurry because it is n't fully-automatic, 
  * having said that , one of the skill level iv variants has fully-auto fire instead of the charge mechanic , if you like that . 
  tac ar has much longer effective range . 
  scope is a bit better , and it has no heat build-up . 
  however , the kick is a bit greater and it only has 24 rounds in the magazine . 
   dsthedrunk , heavy, 
  if it 's a gay pride parade , it 's probably an acceptance test . 
  scramblers and tactical ar have similar damage per shot . 
   serpentine , logi, 
  ai n't nobody got time for that !, 
  i , too , am the only one . 
  yeah . 
  personally , i 'd drop a couple plex on some alt characters on your primary account first , when the dual training option becomes available . 
  account 1 :, 
  * your main, 
  * a trade alt . 
  needs contracting i + trade skills . 
  park in nearest trade hub . 
  * a cheap pi/tech 1 hauler alt for making money, 
  the rationale is that your primary account will be training on your primary character . 
  the other characters are less-often used , and do n't need a lot of skill points to do their job . 
  a secondary account can be played at the same time as your primary , which is usually where you put your cyno alts , mining characters , scouts or whatever . 
  as a guy on six figures in australia , i 'm a-ok with paying stupid ^ * amounts of tax because that 's the price of living in such an awesome country . 
  i 'm not even mad about high prices for software , because you ca n't torrent good healthcare , or work-life balance , or free elections , or student loans pegged to inflation +1 % ... 
  ^ ( * stupid meaning 29 % of my total income ), 
  29 % is averaged over my entire income . 
  australian tax rates go like this :, 
  * $ 0 -- $ 18,200 : nil, 
  * $ 18,201 -- $ 37,000 : 19c for each $ 1 over $ 18,200, 
  * $ 37,001 -- $ 80,000 : $ 3,572 plus 32.5 c for each $ 1 over $ 37,000, 
  * $ 80,001 -- $ 180,000 : $ 17,547 plus 37c for each $ 1 over $ 80,000, 
  * over $ 180,000 : $ 54,547 plus 45c for each $ 1 over $ 180,000, 
  the capped amounts are basically the sum of the previous tax bracket . 
  why 's that ? 
  you right click a plex and then it allows two characters to have skills training at once , for 30 days . 
  when the time ends , whichever one has the most skill points continues training and the other one stops . 
  drug patents , and the abuse thereof via [ ever greening ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evergreening ) : do you see a need to change australian law ? 
  [ economists are saying ] ( http://economics.com.au/?p=9404 ) that linking our carbon trading scheme to the eu would basically devalue our carbon credits due to a history of rampant fraud generating them in europe . 
  considering that , are the greens in favour of economic controls to limit the rate at which the market can access these really-cheap-but-probably-fake credits ? 
  you still have to build those turbines out of something somebody dug out of the ground . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  like i said , the effective tax rate for me is ~ 29 % , sans tax tricks . 
  perhaps 30 % due to medicare levy . 
  yes , the highest tax rate is 45 % . 
  it 's surprisingly hard to get to that tax bracket though . 
  what people forget when it comes to crest is that stuff that is a neat thing to have for one character can scale out to the point where a single person could use crest to control 400 industry characters without even logging in . 
  ps3 on my desk with a spare flat screen monitor checking in . 
  perhaps you could get 24-hour research and manufacturing queues , just like skill queues , except it will only auto-fill a single slot ( per account ) . 
  good for awkward finish times and fiddly small jobs , does n't scale massively . 
  i had a singaporean flat mate at university . 
  she used to drink milk all the time as well . 
  of course , she used to get a lot of flatulence and/or stomach gas afterwards because she was * lactose intolerant but did n't know it * ; she put that down as ` oh , everybody gets that , lah ' .
