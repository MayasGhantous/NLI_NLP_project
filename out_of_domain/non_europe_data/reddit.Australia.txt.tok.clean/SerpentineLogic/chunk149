  or / r/frugal and save a lot more than $ 1/day . 
  bombings warehouse, 
  even then , probably not . 
  hardly anyone can name any actor from the silent film era besides charlie chaplin , and that 's less than 100 years ago . 
  maybe it 's * you * ~, 
  do n't biomass ; just unsub with a plex in your hangar . 
  tbh my rss feed is the best part of eve . 
  check phone to see how long until i need to login, 
  do n't login . 
  i , too , stock corpses in my wardrobe . 
  i mean , why buy mannequins when you already have them ? 
  two months if you do n't play ; about a month or so if you do . 
  all of the races and suits have advantages ; aside from the amarr logistics suit which has a bit too little power grid , they 're all pretty balanced too . 
  maybe i 'll blog about the various suits tonight or something . 
  since you have the skill trained , you can fly ships that need it , even after the patch . 
  having said that , advanced spaceship command is pretty good for freighters since it reduces their abysmal align time , 
  wait , what ? 
  startup costs : depends on [ which one ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/typesearch.html?search=tower ) . 
  assume 70m for small , 130m for medium , 250m for large . 
  then you 'll need fuel , which will probably cost you the same amount as the tower each month , give or take . 
  benefits ? 
  you get a place to stash things and private industry arrays . 
  the drawbacks ? 
  you 're paying a fair chunk of isk to run them , so you better use it , 
  moon mining ? 
  generally if it 's rarity 8 or lower , you wo n't break even . 
  pretty-much anything rarity 16 or higher will break even , but you 'd best know what you 're doing . 
  defenses ? 
  yes please . 
  skills ? 
  anchoring iii should be sufficient for most everything . 
  sec status ? 
  personally , i 'd put it in lowsec , but then again i have a few friends to help out . 
  rumour is you wear the same * style * of shoes . 
   that fact you 're wanted makes me a little scared, 
  as the [ saying goes ] ( http://www.searchquotes.com/quotation/life_doesn%27t_offer_you_promises_whatsoever_so_it%27s_very_easy_to_become%2c_%27whatever_happened_to..._%3f%27_/70733/ ) , `` it 's great to be wanted '' . 
  i have bad news for you . 
  ** mass driver ammo capacity **, 
  +5 % to mass driver maximum ammunition capacity per level, 
  this means that maximum you can carry around at one time , not the size of your magazine/clip . 
  the only weapons that get + clip size are scrambler pistols , swarm launchers , and any sidearms carried by a minmatar assault suit . 
  79 is the atomic number of gold , btw . 
  when eve players attempt to take control of a faction warfare system , dust mercenary contracts spawn on planets in that system . 
  dusties can deploy on a side of their choice , so they can choose to deploy on the amarr side and win lots , or deploy on the minmatar side and suicide until they run out of clones . 
  either way , districts captured on behalf of a faction make it easier or harder for the system to flip occupancy . 
  as a swarm launcher user , confirming his targetosity . 
  try aideron robotics . 
  if you 're an industry nut , you should know that you ca n't even buy the minerals needed for 125m isk . 
  these people are highly unlikely to run a web site . 
  i like http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com, 
  then again , i already know what i want to build . 
  you may prefer [ iskperhour ] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/eveiph/ ) instead .

   we 'll be making some adjustments to the rifle ranges in the near future . 
  we 're currently testing the rail rifle and combat rifle internally ( the two missing archetypes ) . 
  within the assault rifle class the four weapon types will break down as follows :, 
   assault rifle ( hybrid - plasma ) - short range, 
   combat rifle ( projectile - autocannon ) - short-mid range, 
   scrambler rifle ( laser - pulse ) - mid range, 
   rail rifle ( hybrid - railgun ) - long range, 
   keep in mind though that long range for an assault rifle is not equivalent to long range for a sniper rifle , so while they will adhere to existing category definitions do n't expect massive differences in the distances between these weapons, 
   a lot of the original assault rifle variants ( breach , burst , tactical ) were created to fill the gaps these newer weapons will fill and so might 've felt out of place ( not to mention we just plain made mistakes with some of them ) . 
  the scrambler rifle 's optimal range will be increased and we 'll be releasing an iteration of the tactical assault rifle with a smaller clip and much wider hip-fire spread making it less effective in cqc . 
  if that change alone does not prove enough we will walk the damage of the tar down slowly . 
  no big , sweeping changes this time . 
  it 's a monocle for your pod . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  wait , what ? 
  it 's $ 1.50 at the vending machine at my train station . 
  you must be thinking of the 600ml ( ~ pint ) bottles . 
  it scales with your age , mate , otherwise nobody would employ teenagers , ever . 
  depends where on the supply/demand curve your country is . 
  technically , student loans go up with inflation . 
  then again , you only * have * to pay them back when you have a job . 
  as an australian , canadians and new zealanders are our cultural mates . 
  * dominate a single sport, 
  * have an amusing accent, 
  * still attend the commonwealth games, 
  * no stupid voting systems, 
  * largely avoided the gfc by not being stupid with money, 
  * have lots of actors who make it big in hollywood by having credible american accents . 
  well , it was a nice easter egg . 
  big ups , ccp, 
  where do you live ? 
  cans are a buck fifty everywhere in brisbane . 
  any details on what will be turning up in the storefront ? 
  they have a job , you 'll have a trade . 
  that $ 6.85 per hour buys you a future at a much cheaper price than university . 
  i ordered the cd so i do n't mind either way . 
  it would probably involve a central server that parses the emdr feed , but you could make alerts when a player 's orders are over/underbid .

  case in point : [ continuum magazine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuum_%28magazine%29 ) . 
  / r/evedreddit has all the details . 
  planetary management is pretty neat , and does n't take a lot of effort to bring in a decent amount of isk . 
  some things to read are, 
  * [ newbie guide ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/w/index.php?title=planetary_interaction ), 
  * [ skill point sweet spot ] ( http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/planetary-interaction-skill-sweet-spot.html ), 
  * [ commodities chart ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/planetary_commodities ), 
  the main difficulty with starting planetary interaction is getting access to unspoiled planets . 
  planets in nullsec space are generally untouched , but you 'll be subject to non-trivial customs duties in return .
