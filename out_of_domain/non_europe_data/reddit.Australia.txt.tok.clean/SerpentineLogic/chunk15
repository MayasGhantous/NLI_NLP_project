  get cracking !, 
  is it being around other people that 's the problem , or is it the one-on-one interaction ? 
  i ask because in a nullsec fleet fight , there is n't a lot of back-and-forth conversation between people ; it 's more like a series of orders . 
  you can swap subsystems in station . 
  obviously , you ca n't do the same for the rigs , but you ca n't go terribly wrong with some tech 2 rigor catalysts and a ccc/flare catalyst . 
  well , the hurricane * does * have more slots , so you can put more defence ( and more guns ) on it , so even if you t1 fit it , it 's still a better ship . 
   if you are interested in this bill , i 'll follow up with posts about the subsequent readings , just let me know it 's something worth doing here in / r/australia . 
  more correctly , a hurricane does 50 % more damage ( closer to 80 % since it has an extra low slot for a gyrostab ) compared to a rupture . 
  and the 6 million vs 60 million isk comparison is flawed in some respects . 
  upgrading to a battlecruiser from a cruiser is the * cheapest * way to get that 80 % dps boost . 
  plus , you get to strip your rupture of its weapons and reuse them on the hurricane . 
  in addition , if you add rigs to a rupture , its cost shoots up by another six million isk - money that is arguably better spent on a better ship . 
  i 'm not trying to dissuade you from flying the rupture ; it 's an awesome ship and people with 50 million skill points still fly them in pvp and love it . 
  my point is that , after a certain point which is reached fairly rapidly , you 'll get better bang for your buck by reshipping into a not-very-expensive battlecruiser . 
  the core difference between eve and other mmorpgs is this :, 
  in eve , you are ** not the hero of the story ** . 
  it 's the [ / r/trees ] ( / r/trees ) version of the human centipede , essentially . 
  and that 's why elton john is the best . 
   scrap-heap challenge is gone, 
  there 's a ( not really interesting ) [ story to that ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/evegate-counterdrops-scrapheap-shc-fail-cascades/ ) . 
  only when you can afford & nbsp ; ^ ( to & nbsp ; lose ) it !, 
  what about beards ? 
  well , if you join red vs blue for a while , to brush up on your pvp skills , you can easily lose fifty ships for 100 million isk , and get on fifty killmails .

  come on , +2 s are only 4 million each , and you only need two of them . 
  how jiggly wiggly lovey dovey . 
  til that it 's possible to be overboobed . 
  note to self : build up resistance to overboobery . 
  you can get a free 14 day trial on the eve online web site , or get an existing player to send you an invitation email for a 21-day trial ( see [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/nieri/142160_day_trial_thread/?sort=new ) ) . 
  that player gets valuable prizes when you eventually subscribe , so it 's traditional to split the rewards with you . 
  as far as expensive goes , eve is uncommon amongst mmos in that you can buy additional game time with in-game currency . 
  it can be a high hurdle to amass that much money every month , but many veteran players have enough spare in their wallets to fund themselves for a few months . 
  you enter a solar system cut off from the rest of the galaxy , only accessible through temporary wormholes to other places . 
  you do n't know whether the system has anyone else in it unless they choose to let you know , and it 's inhabited by sentient robots intent on your destruction . 
  or as the more cynical among us describe it , `` like submarines in space '', 
  it has its charms . 
  pretty much everyone went to failheap . 
  many of them are subbed again , although i see viper shizzle sold off twelve accounts worth of his characters . 
  and a houseboat . 
  it 's the only way to be sure .

  might scrape through the rigorous dreddit entrance requirement .

  well , the indians needed the concept of putting a zero on the end of a number to indicate multiplying it by ten for theological reasons . 
  a lot of conceptual thought experiments ( like ` how many years it would be to make a cube of eyelashes ten miles per side if you placed one eyelash every century ' ) involved big numbers . 
  my suggestion : keep farming incursions while the going 's good . 
  you 'll eventually get tired of it , so hopefully you 'll have banked a few billion by the time you quit . 
  unless it 's steroids or narcotics , yeah . 
  ofc if it turns out to be full of melamine and you die , tough .

  the belts count as small incursion sites .

  aaaaarmoor haaacs !, 
   can anyone confirm that 12k is the avg per hour ? 
  if your extractor says it 's getting 12k per hour , then , on average , it will be extracting 12k per hour . 
  it will probably be extracting a lot more at the start , and a bit less at the end of the cycle . 
  if you 're asking whether 12k per hour is the average for a planet , then no . 
  all planets are different , and the best ones are way over 60k units/hour from one ecu . 
  he misunderstood your question .

  [ / r/evenewbies ] ( / r/evenewbies ) -  that way . 
  having said that , the punisher is a good frigate , but not quite so good for tackling since it ca n't use stasis webs to slow a target down ( it can still stop a ship from warping off , which is still important ) . 
  if you want webs , you 'll need to fly an ~ ~ executioner ~ ~ crucifier ( or train for a rifter ) instead . 
  guns are optional on tackle frigates so all you need to do is train minmatar frigate iii then return to your amarr training plan . 
  if you find you like tackling , then amarr has a pretty decent tech 2 interceptor : the malediction . 
   i 'm not quite sure there are enough `` hardcore '' players with 3 + accounts to justify it financially . 
  to the turbemobile !, 
  but seriously , the average number of accounts per player is about 2 . x , so there 's likely to be quite a few people with three . 
  step 1 : you need scanning skills to find mission-runners ( assuming you do * ninja * salvaging ) . 
  get an imicus , throw on some cheap gravity capacitor upgrade rigs and bookmark a likely target . 
  step 2 : reship to another ship fit with salvagers in the highs , and a mwd to zoom about ( a catalyst works fine here , since it 's zippy and has a lot of high slots ) and go salvage the wrecks . 
  change the cans to list view instead of icon view , and make sure you can see the meta level of the loot in cans ( right clicking on the headings and select `` show meta level '' ) . 
  that way you can work out whether it 's worth looting or not . 
  i wish i could post as bitterly as the op . 
  you also might find the [ visual guide ] ( http://www.mylootyourtears.com/?p=1428 ) helpful . 
  after all , it 's from the suddenly ninjas corporation . 
  i bet they know a bit about ninjing . 
  i 'm of the opinion that any time saved zooming around is offset by the extra wait due to having fewer salvagers going ... 
  in rough order of importance :, 
  * jury rigging ( only need level i for gravity capacitor upgrades ), 
  * astrometrics ( v lets you use tech 2 expanded probe launchers ),
