  i think his corp is even hiring pi guys . 
   you may want to look into mining as a source of income and find a good series to watch on netflix while you mine .

  well , for the next five days , you might be able to make a bit of profit making dominixes , armageddons , typhoons and scorpions , since the build costs will rise once odyssey is released . 
  good-value blueprint copies might not be available on contracts so close to patch day , though . 
  you might like to start small ; perhaps aim for the new destroyers , or the large-capacity industrials like the iteron mark v. 
  maybe try using [ eveiskperhour ] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/eveiph/ ) then . 
  not yet ; too busy dusting .

  nope , those are retail prices set by the game publishers . 
  the government has nothing to do with it . 
   i seem to recall reading something about china having hundreds of dialects , but only two recognized ones ( cantonese and mandarin ) . 
  technically , they 're different languages , but since they 're both in the same country , the government of china elects to call them dialects . 
  tldr ; if you do n't have your own military , it 's a dialect , not a language . 
  sure , it 's inequitable , but it 's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things . 
  tbh i just pay for it out of the thousands i save on healthcare compared to if i lived in the us vov . 
  i hear vermont is toying with single-payer healthcare . 
  just like canada , perhaps it will start in one small place then spread across the country .

  i 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make here . 
  you will still need the skills .

  the top-rated fits are n't terrible , but rarely stellar .

  i would n't have gone for < racial  assault iii with only 1.6 m sp , but it 's done now so i guess you 'll have to live with it . 
  i 'd train for these skills :, 
  * dropsuit upgrades ii, 
  * dropsuit core upgrades ii ( eventually v ), 
  * dropsuit electronics ii ( eventually v ), 
  * dropsuit engineering ii ( eventually v ), 
  * dropsuit armor upgrades ii ( eventually v since you 're gallente ), 
  * dropsuit shield upgrades ii, 
  * armor repair systems i +, 
  * armor plating iii +, 
  * shield extension iii +, 
  * explosives i , then grenadier i ( eventually iii ), 
  * handheld weapon upgrades i ( eventually v ), 
  * obviously , assault rifles tree, 
  as far as weapons go , i do n't particularly like the breah ar . 
  try the normal assault rifle , or the tactical assault rifle - you may find them much better . 
  bonus : every fitting thread eventually turns into a bitchfest about warfare links . 
  this is the first non-creepy use of ` groomed ' i have read all year . 
  just ask for any updated fits - sadly that forum has no moderator at the moment or else everything would be pruned back a lot . 
  to be fair to eve , i have been playing quite a lot of dust 514 . 
  if you 're looking for mid-range weapons , you ca n't go past the scrambler rifle ( but you really should be using the amarr assault suits or you risk overheating ), 
  the gallente assault rifle is great for short - to mid-range because it does n't overheat or jam , and you can use the tactical ar for longer-range work , which is the opposite of the sr , where the standard rifle is best for mid-range work , and the assault variant is your go-to for knife-fighting range . 
  however , either weapon is decent in the right hands so you 're not missing out by choosing one over the other . 
  the tar has about the same damage per shot as the scrambler rifle . 
  its magazine size and hip-firing accuracy will be halved next wednesday so use it while you can . 
  to be honest , i tend not to worry much about sidearms since uprising , as the weapon switching is a fair bit slower . 
  i generally just roll with a toxin smg for finishing people off in knife fighting range when i need the spray and pray capability that the tar lacks , but there 's a definite option in the flaylock for punching through the last bit of armor . 
  since you 're a pc gamer , you 're not used to the crutch of auto aim that console gamers lean on . 
   spinfags, 
  i think i 've seen that animated gif . 
  there 's an eve audit program at ride theclown dot com . 
  i 'd link it but i 'm having enough trouble typing on my phone as it is . 
  not bad for a first attempt though . 
  then again , most of dust is a first attempt so it would be nice if they could skip that phase and go straight to the awesome bits . 
  i only use controller for vehicles , tbh . 
  dust is breaking too, 
  way ahead of you, 
  seems ok now .
