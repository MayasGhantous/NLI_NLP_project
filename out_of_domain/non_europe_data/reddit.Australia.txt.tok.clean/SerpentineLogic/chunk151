  i do n't think you 've ever been able to swap suits on a fit . 
  ah yes , * influence * by robert cialdini . 
  if the older one has ever subscribed for more than a month , use it . 
  the number of t2 runs is proportional to the number of runs of the t1 bpc compared to max runs . 
  so if you use a 150 run bpc of a type with max runs of 1500 then it will only produce a 1 run tech 2 blueprint which is a bit of a waste . 
  best of luck , mate . 
  that 's still 70 % better than paying off a loan for a degree you did n't get . 
  there 's a lot of anti oxidants in the first pee you do after waking . 
  i do n't think i 'm that desperate though . 
  does n't brisbane have its own desalination plant that does n't run ? 
  private rain water tanks stopped being banned once the drought hit . 
  i moved from wage , to salary , to consultancy contracts . 
  paid by the hour again : feels good , man . 
  i think there 's a case to be made to revisit the hacs and afs in the same way . 
  there is a * very * effective and cheap treatment for c difficile . 
  it 's [ not pleasant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fecal_bacteriotherapy ) to think about though . 
  well , we all have hobbies ... 
  mine costs a [ third of that ] ( http://www.bupa.com.au/health-insurance/browse-health-covers/ci.top-hospital-with-bronze-extras.phi?excess=excess_500 ) , and even then i think it 's expensive . 
  last time i advertised on reddit , i had awoxers apply for the next month . 
  heck , i still have my eye on three of the recruits that did get in . 
   having no sovereign state means nobody to stop others from taking everything you have . 
  cool , so what stops the banks from taking it ? 
  that does n't count vehicular incidents involving kangaroos , which are a lot more deadly . 
  it 's like hitting a deer that can punch you when it goes through your windscreen . 
  mining barges and exhumers got changed . 
  ice and some ores are getting changed this week . 
  1000 skill points per hour ( plus extra if you have a passive booster ) , i.e. 
  just over 700 000 points per month . 
  at present , it does n't trickle off if you have n't logged in . 
  seems legit . 
  i expect the gallente to have automatic or three round burst pistols , because that 's how they roll . 
  i think the last thing they need is more incoming internet traffic right now . 
  since it 's 545am there , i think they 're justified in having a bit of a nap after a long night fixing stuff . 
  i love that spreadsheet . 
  i should probably donate some isk to mike devoid . 
  remote . 
  obviously it was test so they can retain nol . 
  unless it was actually ncdot so they can blame test . 
  unless it was actually goons , so they can pin it on ncdot and nol is still safe and now test owes them a favour . 
  unless it was actually test , so they can pin it on goons to retain the moral high ground ~ when they lose nol anyway the next day . 
  unless it was actually test and they were aiming at ncdot but were reading their network map upside down . 
  dust too, 
  evegate 's still down . 
  i do . 
  means i have to login less . 
  that 's per planet , with 10 % tax , with refilling silos every 3 days . 
  seems about right . 
  it 's not work if you enjoy it . 
  not to mention the swedes bombing the mines themselves . 
  [ literally 9 hours ago ] ( / r/eve/comments / 1flwy0/eft _ data_files_with_odyssey_changes / ), 
  i went out with a third of the girls in my class at university . 
  the only thing that stopped me getting it higher was the other two girls were taken . 
  i 'm terrible with a controller so without a mouse , i would n't be able to play at all . 
  players with controllers are the best vehicle pilots anyway . 
  dust still down . 
  brb raging, 
  reminds me of the gallente medium frames in dust . 
  i 'd like to see ccp write the chronicle about a templar who bio massed ... 
  aura will need an update . 
  heck , if you buy or sell new items , you 'll probably crash the app when you view your transactions . 
  i do n't even . 
  australia also has this , except [ the stuff ] ( http://www.bountybags.com.au/ ) is provided by companies hoping to sell you more of it . 
  they 're handed out at hospitals or you can order them . 
  also , you get three of them , for different stages of pregnancy . 
  i knew drew from 3kingdoms , back when online games were text-only . 
  that 's right ; i 'm a fark hipster . 
  i did n't get that . 
  old launcher appears, 
  patched successfully, 
  login screen appears, 
  enter credentials, 
  login, 
  change skills, 
  logoff again because loleve, 
  i thought ccp dolan would be a terrible hire , but he has proven to be a better ccp employee than he ever was as a player . 
  here 's hoping mintchip adults up in a similar way . 
  old core2 macbook pro running 10.8 ( i think ), 
  ccp dolan is better than michael bolton iii was . 
  people can improve . 
  i 'll reserve judgement for now . 
  we used to have combined engineering + nursing social events , just to unskew the gender ratios . 
   i also note that no one is crying about the lack of men playing the sims !, 
  well , yeah , because they 're playing every . 
  other . 
  game . 
  i [ wish this ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?9995-devblog-new-year-s-revolutions ) were a real dev blog ... 
  minmatar freighters are arguably the best , though . 
  * fenrir : 36s, 
  * providence : 39.5 s, 
  max speed ( max skills ), 
  * fenrir : 125 m/s, 
  * providence : 109 m/s, 
  sure , the charon carries a bit more , but unless you regularly carry full loads , it 's probably better to go for a fenrir . 
  actually , they warp at 0.75 au/s , and 5 seconds saving represents a 4 % faster speed if manually warping to zero . 
  however , the faster max speed saves an additional 33 seconds per jump when autopiloting , which adds up . 
  i 've [ done the math ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/freighter-pilot-implants/ ) on this . 
  it 's just a softening-up campaign for ccp gevlon . 
  not even once . 
  tuxford , stop pressing the big red button .
