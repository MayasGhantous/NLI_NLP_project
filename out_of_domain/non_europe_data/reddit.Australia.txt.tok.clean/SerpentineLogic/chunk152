  i do n't think mittens is really cut out to be someone else 's employee . 
  most au time zone players tend to be pretty hard core . 
  practically all of us are in null sec alliances or heavy into dust514 in molden heath low sec . 
  there 's a lot of guys who hang out in the eve thread on whirlpool . 
  you could ask there . 
  i meant clicking that link . 
  get out . 
  you do n't even inject isk , because that isk is provided by another player . 
  [ bunker fuel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuel_oil#bunker_fuel ) . 
  if it did n't get used in ships , there 's not much else it can be used for besides making roads . 
  i think they will . 
  they want dust to last years ; that 's not going to work if it 's stuck on the ps3 as the world moves on . 
  nobody is telling at this stage . 
  it 's a lower class thing . 
  i am in favour of changing the armor speed penalty to a - stamina penalty . 
  it means armor suits can still dodge between cover in a fight , but it strongly curtails their long-range ` map mobility ' . 
  just put 1 point into caldari medium frame now , and enjoy the sensation of being shot at and recovering inside 20 seconds . 
  took it out for a test drive . 
  18 shots makes a big difference in cqc . 
  it 's enough to drop someone but not enough to take on 2v1 . 
  the hip fire spread is n't a huge issue if you 're only firing 4 rounds per second like a normal person , even at short-mid range , but probably kicks in when you 're really spamming it . 
  this is the most polite [ citation needed ] i have ever read . 
  * all * your skills ? 
  how much sp do you have ? 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  maybe ratting is op , then ?

  actually , i think i 've seen you around a bit in au tz . 
  you should look up more often . 
  seems op to me .

  cool .

   we 'll be addressing armor tanking with multiple updates going forward :, 
   new armor modules will be released with the ** uprising 1.2 patch ** :, 
   * ferroscale plates ( smaller hp buff but no speed penalty ), 
   * reactive plates ( small hp buff and minor repair rate buff - plates that heal themselves !, 
  big smile ), 
   * we 'll be reducing the movement speed penalty slightly on armor plates in a future hot-fix . 
   - giving proper racial bonuses !, 
  the reason the gallente do n't get ( the very obvious ) bonus to movement speed when armor tanking at the moment is because we use a tag system to confer bonuses to items and currently there is no way to exclude an item from getting a bonus . 
  the only way to do this would be to tag everything in the game that is n't the gallente suit with a tag , which is error-prone and likely to ensure we unintentionally screw up some unrelated skill at some point . 
  this will be corrected as soon as is feasible . 
  basic frames currently have zero bonuses . 
  racial frames ( e.g. 
  assault ak0 ) get 2 bonuses , both of which are based on the racial skill ( e.g. 
  amarr assault dropsuits ) . 
  it is planned that basic frames will get a single bonus , which differs between the races and frame sizes , and specialized frames will get two bonuses - one from the basic frame skill , and the other on the specialist frame skill . 
  a + + + + + + would jump again, 
  i read an article that said that the script for brave was mutilated during production , which is kinda sad because it was the brainchild of the producer . 
  sounds like she 's winning the meta game . 
  we * wish * . 
  it 's the company that owns tmdc . 
  that 's why i always unsub with a plex in my hangar in jita . 
  this is *** serious *** business . 
  tldr ;, 
  * armor tanking and shield tanking are misnomers ; each suit has both armor and shield , even if their focus is on a particular one, 
  * buffer is n't that important , provided you have enough to win a 1v1, 
  * recovery time * is * important , because it decreases the time before you 're combat-worthy to get the next kill . 
  * however , you only need sufficient recovery speed to handle the next enemy ; if the time between enemies is low , you can afford slow recovery . 
  * it 's complicated . 
  actually , two men and one woman lost their jobs . 
  until small rails deal 100 % damage to vehicles again , you 'll have to use small missiles . 
  are you a ceo or director ? 
   i have to say i was hoping to get some more feedback on the map . 
  at this point there 's no technical reason why it ca n't be put into production with a couple more adjustments , but i would like some more feedback first ( even if it 's just some more thumbs-ups ) . 
   however my bigger concern is that i still need someone to step up to the plate and reliably offer to hash out the coalition memberships . 
  raynor 's data is a month old and i would surmise is n't very good in the first place . 
  if someone could periodically compile a good list , then this could go into regular production and that person would be getting the appropriate credit for their work . 
  if you have updates , [ please evemail him ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/verite%20rendition ) , 
  why would you need a third party for a carrier ? 
  tell that to michael douglas . 
  or whirlpool, 
  even then , why take the risk ? 
  so all they need to do is remove the onesecond delay before cooling, 
  nice to see a balanced review . 
  there 's no way to pull the data from your asset api , but this site will pull it from industry jobs you do and update its records accordingly . 
  why should it be a per-shot heating effect when the duration you hold the mouse down affects damage and should also affect heat ? 
  that got fixed in uprising . 
  also , area effect damage covers up a multitude of aiming mistakes . 
  typically , haulers fit expanded cargo holds and cargo rigs . 
  only for ships though . 
   pilots in eve must work for their isk . 
  speak for yourself . 
  once you get a medium frame to skill level iii , you can train racial logistics suits . 
  these have the advantage of multiple equipment slots at the expense of a side arm slot . 
  the bonuses provided by training and using a racial logistics drop suit can be substantial . 
  when i sub using real money , i usually go for 6 months . 
  as far as weapons go , train whatever suits the ships you most want . 
  you 'll eventually train up both turrets and missiles so do n't feel like you 'll be missing out either way . 
  to be honest , i limped along with tech 1 weapons for the first 6 months while i trained support skills up :-p, 
  oh , we can get pretty close , cerbus . 
  if you can find a discount code , you should be able to get 5 % off the price from eve time code dot com . 
  otherwise , pay full price from blink and get isk to gamble with . 
  i 've heard of a village idiot before , but not a neighbourhood mother fucker . 
  procurer is a lot cheaper ( and tougher ) - better to get into a procurer while you 're saving up for a retriever .
