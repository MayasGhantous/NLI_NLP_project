  run it on a pc like the dust devs do . 
  or maybe [ you could ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=kate+norlet&amp;oq=kate+norley ) . 
  confirming that a talos without t2 ammo is nowhere near as good . 
  naturally . 
  phew , i can stop reposting your stuff now . 
  the layout is great for getting the current report breakdown , but one thing that would be nice would be an rss feed or way to link to updated reports as they come in . 
  ** edit : ** looks like you have an rss feed but it does n't have anything in it . 
  `` never not shoot blues '', 
  they must be in your customs office to import . 
  how to get them there is your problem . 
  some systems have actual level 4 agents . 
  tldr ; free 1-day active booster . 
   do you know how almost every other military deals with it ? 
  at the unit level . 
  what if the unit command is the * problem * ? 
  just extend your current one with it . 
  surprisingly not many eve mails . 
  i do have a small collection of extreme butt hurt dust mails though . 
  evoke is still around iirc . 
  it 's because north korea can assassinate an individual citizen , but it 's a bit harder to suppress the entire us state department . 
   wear a sperm suit, 
  way ahead of you . 
  just as good now as it was last month when he wrote it . 
  one million isk for winning , plus salvage based on what your team has blown up . 
  your corp also gets stuff based on clones remaining . 
  try it , it 's a god send . 
  depends on the accent , too . 
  australians are very susceptible to losing their accent in the usa , but yanks retain theirs for decades in oz . 
  fleet-up . com ? 
  great on a proteus . 
  i had a girlfriend like that . 
  i 'm on a mac . 
  what new launcher ? 
  voice coaches will help . 
  it 's pretty hard for yanks to pick up our accent though , compared to the other way around . 
  no , she * went down * in the middle of the day . 
  scale ? 
  so far no . 
  the fall of the nc was waged from kalevala expanse all the way to branch , whereas the fountain war is restricted to fountain + skirmishes elsewhere . 
  number of players involved ? 
  definitely . 
  test+gsf are the largest alliances in eve ; even without allies on each side it 's a major war . 
  length ? 
  not yet ; campaigns against bob would last 6 months + . 
  have you read their employee handbook ? 
  he wants donations from his killers . 
  in the usa , freedom is commonly understood to mean ` freedom to do x ' . 
  elsewhere , freedom is often understood to mean ` freedom * from * x ' . 
  it 's a subtle distinction but it colours a lot of arguments about whether the government should let you do what you want , even if it 's to the detriment of the country . 
  for drunk roams ? 
  tequila , lemon and [ salt made from tears of sorrow ] ( http://www.monstersupplies.org/products/salt-made-from-tears-of-sorrow ) . 
  wait , you 're supposed to * read * the op ? 
  all * i * feel is smoothness . 
  isk , the guide . 
  the eve university wiki . 
  know your enemy . 
  yet another species in danger due to logging in the map of tassie . 
  [ accurate ] ( http://www.technocrazed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/brazilian-amazon-deforestation_2.gif ) . 
  person a : does exploration , eventually shifts to probing down players instead . 
  eventually skills towards recons and/or strategic cruisers . 
  person b : skills up for frontline combat . 
  starts with stuff useful for pve ( incursions are good practice ) . 
  eventually skills into whatever 's best for pvp at the time . 
  so , you both have something to do when you roll solo , and if you fleet up , person a can scan down targets and person b can jump them with a providing electronic warfare of whatever description . 
  depends which nightclub you go to ... 
  fyi , a decent skill plan for a newbie looks a [ bit like this ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/index.php?title=the_newberry%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy#but_seriously.2c_what_do_i_train_first.3f ) . 
   this week on the marketplace , we have the following [ gallente week ] items :, 
   [ ` codewish ' duvolle tactical assault rifle - 50 aur  ( http://i.imgur.com/j59ppym.png ), 
   [ aerial assault pack ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=85449&amp;find=unread ) ( still on sale ), 
  also [ 1 hour downtime on tuesday ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=949542#post949542 ) to deploy the marketplace updates . 
  if you 're only going to have one solar system in your game , why choose anything except poitot ? 
  so , five cents per suit . 
  check the number of players online . 
  i 'm using the time to experiment . 
  i 'm like all `` pew pew active scanner '' and `` zorch zorch scrambler rifle '' and then `` puh-chew puh-chew flaylock '' and `` crapcrapcrap \\* explode \\* '' dropships . 
  note that this review was a bligh initiative , so who knows what will happen under newman . 
  [ the usual . 
  you 're probably not a queensland driver . 
  here , everyone goes 10km over the speed limit . 
  always . 
  coming from sydney , it was quite a shock . 
  well , that , and the fact that nobody knows how to zipper merge up here . 
  why not use [ drk ] ( http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com/ ) ? 
  oculus rift [ just announced ] ( http://www.pcworld.com/article/2041464/eyes-on-oculus-rift-vr-headset-ramps-up-the-resolution.html ) 1080p resolution and unreal engine 4 support . 
  unreal4 also has support for playstation 4 . 
  i wonder whether ~ other parts ~ of ccp will jump on the or bandwagon ... 
  pretty-much everyone i 've fought in the last 2 weeks has done this . 
  `` having trouble getting up in the morning ? '', 
  $ max_players_on_team / 2 would be about right , as long as the map bug is fixed . 
  well , dust players are n't giving them $ 15 a month either . 
  `` we do n't ask for much , and we get it ! '', 
  [ nope . 
  it 's not the weapons ; it 's the suit and modules . 
  a prototype medium frame can sport 600hp ; almost 2 seconds of continuous assault rifle fire to take down . 
  concentrate on survivability and utility to your team while you 're still in basic suits . 
  and yes , there is n't matchmaking at the moment . 
  there 's nineteen uplinks and one person on blue . 
  are you using mouse and keyboard ? 
  good news : [ skill respecs this week ] ( http://dustsearch.com/thread/84418/author/ccp#5 ) . 
  just use a blockade runner .
