   what is the test/goon war all about ? 
  the usual reasons . 
  money and power . 
  when i was a kid , they called rockhampton ` rockvegas ' . 
  i assumed it was just wishful speaking on the part of radio announcers . 
  literally [ 40 minutes ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/1gmvex/what_is_the_testgoon_war_all_about/ ) . 
  i hear it 's a bit of a grind when you start out . 
  if you want to do it solo , it 's much easier to set up some reaction towers in a class one wormhole instead of primary production of moon goo . 
  bonus points if you set up a planetary extraction empire at the same time . 
  a bit like mee ** yol ** nyer . 
  you are my favourite ccp employee named after a desert . 
  well , you could just use a passive shield tanked myrmidon . 
  highs : who cares, 
  mids : 3 large shield extender ii + 2 hardeners or passive resists, 
  lows : 6 x beta reactor control : shield power relay i, 
  that 's because it 's * pronounced * heela . 
  jitta , but with a shorter t. i.e. 
  how the japanese would pronounce it . 
  edited . 
  still in dust mode . 
  the mammoth : not so big after all ^ tm, 
  i could see the mammoth model being sexed up and repurposed into a battleship design though . 
  proto stuff too good and too cheap you say ? 
  brb market speculating . 
  it 's not all stuff though ; just the modules , and not even all of them . 
  for instance , i think they got the weapons pretty-much right . 
  going from standard to advanced to prototype is a minor , * minor * improvement for most weapons compared to the extra cpu and grid they need . 
  similarly for most equipment and some modules , where you do get improvements , but you pay for them with much increased fitting costs . 
  however , for many modules , and hit point-related modules in particular , it 's way out of whack . 
  yep . 
  japanese vowels are [ terse ] ( http://japanese.about.com/od/introductoryjapaneselesso/a/blank.htm ) . 
  if you drag out the final syllable of nagasaki to make it sound like ` tea ' , you 're incorrectly [ happy-tensing ] ( http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=2565278 ) . 
  if you 're going caldari , you need shield extension v and , ideally , shield upgrades v first . 
  complexe shield extenders really are that good . 
  i 'm saying it 's ki as in kiss , not as in keep . 
  so , so much better . 
  still takes some getting used to , especially in heavy suits because their acceleration is lower , but it 's way better . 
  complex extenders are like 4k each . 
  you should be able to run a basic caldari medium frame with blueprint rifle for about 16k isk . 
  shield extenders : 22 -  33 -  ** 66 **, 
  it 's so much better than the others that using anything lower is basically a wasted slot . 
  ah cool . 
  i 'll subscribe to the district report . 
  i was expecting the feed linked to the home page to have stuff , though . 
  [ vehicle shield extenders ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/index.php?title=shield_extenders_%28vehicles%29 ) are nowhere near as bad . 
  there 's a 15 % spread between standard and top-tier . 
  they even have a ` easy to fit but smaller bonus ' module , which is a nice touch . 
  i understand that there needs to be an incentive to spend the sp to get level 5 in a skill , but frankly , the benefit curve for a few modules is too generous . 
  ( when it comes to drawbacks of armor modules , it 's the other way around imo ), 
  i have no idea . 
  i often just join pre-existing squads when i roll solo in a match and say hi . 
  i 've picked up quite a few friends that way , and two entire corps of enemies . 
  or just host the apk on [ eve-files ] ( http://eve-files.com/ ) ? 
  assuming people trust you etc etc. 
  because aura tells me to ? 
  that 's a fair assessment of the current state . 
  this is a critical point for dust , and if we do n't see major improvements month on month , it is in serious trouble . 
  * all ranges are measured from the tower , but gun placement is important , for fields of fire/smartbombing protection etc. 
  * totally up to you . 
  it 's a good idea to keep some anchored but offline shield hardeners though . 
  * yeah , keep some hardeners and guns off lined . 
  accept that you 'll need to turn off your labs if you need to defend those towers . 
  you 're in w-space , so you do n't have the option of disposable towers , because your blueprints ca n't be stashed away in a nearby station . 
  who does n't ? 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  they would have spent the money on vampires anyway . 
  why ? 
  because two games = twice as much income . 
  i would prefer a freemium managed service model like app engine . 
  < x  numbers of notifications per month ; after that , pony up isk . 
  wellllll , it 's a good first try . 
  however , the market does n't have much patience with ` first tries ' in a mature genre such as console fps games . 
  $ 15.96 / hour minimum wage country without backbreaking unemployment checking in . 
  mate . 
  it 's almost as if economies are complex things , and saying ` increased minimum wage inevitably leads to increased unemployment and this is unequivocally bad ' is absurdly simplistic . 
  that has more to do with negative gearing than labor prices . 
   afks have never been anything other than a minor inconvenience to me . 
  when it 's [ five people in one game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wwuwpc0l.jpg ) , it 's more than a minor inconvenience . 
  \\  implying dust would n't flop as hard , or harder in the pc shooter market . 
  `` looks like that driver issue is fixed . 
  fly safe . '', 
  other countries do n't scale their minimum wage , so it 's really hard to get a job until you 're 21 or whatever . 
  there are good reasons to pay youngsters less money , one of them being the effort involved in training them vs hiring someone on the market with one experience . 
  if you do n't meet the system requirements , eve wo n't stop working immediately . 
  it 's just that ccp is giving you a heads-up that the system you 're using now wo n't be able to run eve forever . 
  never unsubscribe without a plex in a hangar ... 
  do you have steam running at the same time ? 
  sometimes they do n't like each other . 
  i bet they 'd play less eve , though . 
  i only have one power 9 . 
  i do , however , have a playset of dual lands . 
  ah , misspent youth . 
  actually , it was originally published on the dust forums . 
  probably better to use an orca in such situations . 
  orcas can carry rigged ships . 
  they 're also faster to align if you give it a kick with a 100mn mwd . 
  it 's just that unpacked ships are huge , but the orca has a ship maintenance bay that can carry them . 
  about 30 % of the non ambush games i play have 2 or more afk players . 
  once , i saw a whole squad join and immediately go afk in mcc . 
  is n't that what time dilation is for ?
