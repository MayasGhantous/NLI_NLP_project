  fleet warp , make melted cheese on toast . 
  so , sounds like the absolute first thing ccp should ask a new player is which control scheme they want . 
  let 's face it , the number of people who would be interested in dust but are n't already familiar with cod or beef controls schemes is vanishingly small . 
  a trading scheme is different to and * better than * a carbon tax . 
  calling it semantics is as wrong as saying ` goldberg spielberg iceberg they 're all the same ',

  there 's eight thousand of them ; that 's a wide talent pool to pick from . 
  yeah , we occasionally gatecrash some fw games . 
  the lag is n't a lot better . 
  in our timezone , instant skirmish is our best bet at getting good games . 
  you are the best ccp employee named after a criminal act . 
  i think being able to change the reinforcement timer of a district was a mistake , especially considering the small size of the region under control . 
  it should have been saved until pc was more widely spread . 
  game of thrones aside , gaining advantage at the expense of your own family often does n't work out in the long run . 
  corn subsidies . 
  i quite like scrambler rifles . 
  just went 7/0 in a 1v1 ambush on the oceanic server with a standard scram . 
  yes . 
  this would make pc less exclusionary , since it will be impossible for someone in one timezone to bogart all the districts or turtle themselves into a pocket without good timezone control , and even then , they ca n't set their reinforcement timers to their strongest tz so their hold is more tenuous . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a cure-all or desirable when it comes to nullsec districts , but it 's an option in lowsec to shake things up . 
  it still needs to be on a timer though , or you 'll see people dropping fivebux as soon as ccp rebalances anything , chasing the newest fotm to the detriment of the game . 
  yes we made our money back . 
  our gross was 120m per day , so we could use our clone reserves instead of buying packs .

  i think i 'll wait for a tldr . 
  tldr ; nexon is running a promotion where a japanese person will be placed in a house for a two-month stint , and the amount and quality of food she gets will be based on how much isk she can accrue while playing eve . 
  the solution is obvious : put food items on her amazon wishlist .

  technically , we gave up * then * hell storm took over , but i can understand the confusion . 
  actually , we just sent in the b team with militia fits . 
  hey , they were in our prime timezone , and it beats fighting squads of afk mccers in pub matches . 
  one match , i got two shield extenders in loot , which paid for all the losses of the entire game .

  five recruits ; zero rewards . 
  at the very least , recruitment links should be corralled into a single thread . 
  ideally , they would be banned from this subreddit entirely unless directly replying to someone asking for a link . 
  probably the same reason you keep logging in . 
  if you do n't like it , you can move out .

  [ reddit has spoken ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1h529o/thinking_about_trying_dust_514_its_free_and_if/ ) , and apparently it 's a-ok to post recruitment links .

  you get booster shots of stuff you got when you were younger .

  generally , you end up with a bunch of injections as an adult because you 're planning on an overseas holiday .

  depends on the type of gear . 
  for drop suits , prototype suits are better than basic suits , but it 's entirely due to the quality of the modules you fit to them . 
  if you fill them with militia grade modules , you 're wasting a large chunk of isk . 
  for equipment , it depends on the type , but generally the standard grade is better than militia grade purely because it 's a lot easier to fit . 
  i strongly suggest using standard-grade equipment . 
  for modules , it can vary wildly . 
  personally , anything lower than complex shield extenders is n't worth it , even though i had to compromise on my caldari medium frame ( 1 complex , 1 enhanced ) due to fitting . 
  generally , though , a good fit will be a mixture of complex where it counts , enhanced or standard where it does n't . 
  for weapons , it also varies wildly . 
  most weapons get very expensive as you go up tiers for marginal benefit , so i often roll with a standard rifle . 
  then again , some weapons really benefit from going up tiers , like complex swarm launchers etc. 
  generally , you run with a standard weapon unless you 're okay with your fit costing 45k isk or more . 
  also , militia weapons and grenades are strictly worse than standard grade so i highly suggest you use standard weapons where you can . 
  you can modify the starter loadouts - probably best to copy them first . 
  after a while , though , you 'll find that the difference between a starter fit and a standard fit is worth the extra 5k isk and run with that instead . 
  it 's probably a bit too early to choose a suit specialisation , but generally getting a basic frame is quite easy to accomplish so do n't feel bad if you change your mind early on . 
  you do know [ there 's a web site ] ( http://eve-live.com/amarr ) for working that out , right ? 
  probably maple syrup .
