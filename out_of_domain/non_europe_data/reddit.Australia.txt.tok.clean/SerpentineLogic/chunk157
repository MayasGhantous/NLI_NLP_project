  [ yes there is ] ( http://evepics.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/epmegafleet.jpg ) . 
  there are a half-dozen outback steakhouses in australia . 
  nobody goes there . 
  the more accounts he gets banned and needs to recreate , the more dust 514 we 're forcing him to play . 
  is n't it delicious ? 
  well , there 's always [ these guys ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fajrulgqloy/ucmoqqnftki/aaaaaaaae1o/pw6h4c40xvw/s1600/sfminiad1.jpg ) . 
  that sounds like a lot of killmails just waiting for an enterprising band of players with spare smartbombs . 
  grenades get a * lot * better as you go up tiers . 
  av grenades are * designed * to kill tanks , just like swarm launchers and prox mines are designed to kill lavs ( they just tend not to ) . 
  i am okay with av grenades losing their homing ability once ( l ) lavs get actual counters . 
  rich people have no problems getting multiple forms of id . 
  poor people may not even be able to afford time off work to get it . 
  the republican party has done its sums and is pushing voter id hard in the us , precisely because it stops poor people voting ( and poor people do n't vote for their party anyway , so fuck 'em ), 
  i do n't see why bpos are worth getting . 
  you 're saving , what , 30k isk per game , but dying more often because you 're running basics instead of advanced , and it 's costing you five or ten bucks for the privilege ? 
  seems like a bad trade to me . 
  on the other hand , sometimes it 's nice to rock some prototype uplinks or whatever without spending the million + sp to use them . 
  9800 aur buys a lot of * good * items . 
  i generally do n't run anything cheaper than advanced if i have the suit skills for a class . 
  it might cost an additional 100k per match , but dying less frequently has some appeal to me . 
  ccp is already turning dust around . 
  yesterday 's patch was feature-light but improvement-heavy . 
  core gameplay is a lot better . 
  triple skill-point week starting thursday downtime ... , 
  *** less *** fatalism ? 
  what have you done with the real poetic stanziel ? 
  protip : even with the addition of ferroscale and reactive plates , there are * still * no good armor mods . 
  however , due to a stacking penalty bug , you can run 3x ferroscale + one complex plate and only suffer -2.83 % move speed instead of -10 % ... 
  hey , it ca n't be all bad ; how many other companies [ have a spouse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erin_hoffman ) ? 
  [ your disguise ] ( http://hacknmod.com/wp-content/old/pics/3128-1.jpg ) does n't fool me . 
  * armor plates slow you down more as you go up grades ; shield extenders do n't . 
  mobility matters more than you 'd expect . 
  * armor plates slow down your turn rate as well as max speed, 
  * armor plates do n't regenerate without choosing reactive plates or repairers ; shield regenerate using zero slots . 
  * shields repair somewhere between 10hp/s and 25hp/s ; armor reps much slower , even using dual reps. 
  this affects downtime between kills , and thus usefulness to the team . 
  * shield take high slots , leaving them with free low slots for a variety of modules ; armor slots must compete with fitting mods , yet the only realistic thing to fit into the high slots is a shield tank, 
  but , antagonizing people is * what we do * . 
  * dropsuit upgrades, 
  * dropsuit armor upgrades, 
  * armor plating, 
  * dropsuit core upgrades, 
  * drop uplink deployment, 
  * dropsuit electronics, 
  * dropsuit engineering, 
  * dropsuit shield upgrades, 
  * weaponry, 
  * light weapon operation, 
  * assault rifle operation ( or an equivalent basic rifle skill , like scrambler rifle operation ), 
  * a basic drop suit frame skill of your choice, 
  see my reply . 
  you wo n't go wrong training each of those skills to ii or more . 
  armor does get more buffer , but it suffers a lot for the privilege . 
  there 's a [ well-written forum thread ] ( http://dustsearch.com/thread/87752 ) that lays out the disparity between shield and armor tanking ; i hope that ccp reads it , because it 's clear from the new ferroscale and reactive plates that they 've low-balled the stats horribly .

  [ the bradbury effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steven_bradbury_\\ ( speed_skater \\ ) # 2002_winter_olympics ) . 
  on vacation in new zealand , i visited a sheep farmer . 
  turns out it 's a relatively common thing to put one goat for every couple hundred sheep , because goats are intelligent enough to learn stuff like, 
  * bell is ringing ? 
  better go to the feed trough, 
  * head is wet ? 
  better go into the barn, 
  and so the sheep herds will follow the goats around . 
  the only problem was that while both goats and sheep respond well to sheepdogs behind them or to the side , but sheepdogs often round up sheep * in front * of the herd to keep the herd compact , which the goats really do not like . 
  i find it amusing that i have zero problems with the extortion of pay-to-play mmos , but am leery of the panhandling style of f2p games . 
  that 's [ not the first time ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/p480x480/999016_492089360864611_566742083_n.jpg ) the comparison has been made . 
  free to play games have three axes of income . 
  * number of players times, 
  * average spend times, 
  * time actively playing, 
  team fortress relies on the first pillar . 
  those shifty exploitative zynga games rely on the second pillar . 
  eve , and now dust , are targeted towards the third pillar . 
  it will be very interesting to see if they can pull it off again . 
  rational ? 
  whoah , let 's not get too hasty . 
  ca n't post , too busy overreacting, 
  i like pay for fashion and pay for convenience . 
  pay to win is not going to do it for me . 
  pay for fashion is obvious . 
  ship skins , station skins , tower skins , tcu skins , special weapon effects , bigger explosions , colored cynos , high heels , the works . 
  i 'd prefer the option of buying them from ccp for aurum , or buying them for isk from someone who did some sort of industry bullshit to make them ( probably involving buying bpcs for aurum ) . 
  pay for convenience is simple . 
  i 'm okay with implants that lower your clone jump timer , or for a target station to light a cyno for me instead of logging on my alt i mean for fuck 's sake just send a janitor out in a shuttle and light one , christ . 
  but pay to win ? 
  i already have that option , and it 's called dropping a couple thousand dollars on plex to buy that shiny ship , or that shiny character , or pay fifty of my closest friends to help me make life hell for that guy who implied my mother was a lousy lay . 
  i 'd prefer not to escalate down that path . 
  also , the government is n't fully funding it , since they just issue bonds to the market for a cash injection and the nbn corporation will pay them off from its profits . 
  good thanks . 
  bit of a stuff up with the armour plates though . 
  disturbing lack of actual range stats . 
  i do n't like it . 
  piloting a ship is for nautical bus drivers . 
  i 'm a captain ; i * command * a ship with the power of double-clicking . 
  i applaud the intention , but it needs a ` coolness ' pass . 
  that sounds fair , considering how english is probably the second language of 80 % of the company . 
  ben stiller does nothing for me . 
  it 's all in the hips . 
   is that official ?
