  i 'm hoping for a gallente flamethrower . 
  player-compiled range stats are [ available here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0apjppa-wprifdgjrc3r5zjvix2m1m0jmefp4s3mzaue#gid=0 ) . 
  not a chance . 
  being * able * to take part in the universe is the biggest draw card to subscribing . 
  you should check out some pc matches . 
  they 're very intense , and everyone brings out the shiny gear . 
  feels good killing people toting officer weps . 
  lasers are actually a lot better in uprising2 . 
  max range 250m is a big deal . 
  well , my tf2 hat collection can be traded in for valuable steam stuff ... 
  does n't matter ; got hats . 
  i have my moments . 
  it was explained already ... 
  deploys happen tuesdays and thursdays . 
  the next question is `` why not change the reset day to tuesday or thursday ? '', 
  the last one was in brisbane vov, 
  `` around '', 
  iceland : a cool place to live . 
  check back with us in a week 's time , 
  if you were talking about cairns , maybe . 
  the great barrier reef is much less of a problem by the time you get down to brisbane and surrounds . 
  the term is [ echo chamber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echo_chamber_%28media%29 ) . 
  there 's a fine line between trickle-down and [ trickle-on ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urination ) . 
  cold and bitter ? 
  i 'm fairly certain eve online players subsidize their economy . 
  bugger . 
  that 's the exact opposite of me . 
  then again i 'm still active in eve until my plex stockpile runs out . 
  tuxford sends [ * his * ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=33020 ) . 
  [ and this is what he looked like then . 
  ] ( http://www.maxim.cz/images/stories/eminem_v_alfim.jpg ), 
   ` reform ' never works . 
  \\* cough \\* [ bullshit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_keating#treasurer ) \\* cough \\*, 
  generally , one gets an orca * after * one decides they need one . 
  at 360 lnoscope \u2143 avenue . 
  i 'd say 20:1 or higher . 
  it 's faster to make 20m isk in eve than it is to make 1m isk in dust . 
  reactive plates are for shield tankers . 
  maybe an increasing bounty to take districts from corps who have held them a long time ... 
   i just started . 
  this is brutal . 
  here 's our fleet comp, 
  so [ fight us maybe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eng-3auyd4u ) . 
  reactive plates have a small amount of reps , which is all you need if you only occasionally dip into armor . 
  if you were going to devote more than one slot to armor , you 're better off with a plate + rep than 2 reactive plates . 
  i learned to analyse behaviour and documents for hidden agendas from eve . 
  this has made me 200 % more cynical but i 'm a lot better at avoiding traps in office politics . 
  if op goes on tilt on real life the way he does in eve , he should never ever play poker . 
  it 's rare to see political ads that , not only do n't encourage people to vote for them , but actively * dis * courage them . 
  frankly , any idealism left after eve got to me was surgically removed [ by this ] ( http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/ ) . 
  i. e. dog whistle politics . 
  get more skill points and move on . 
  it 's all you can do . 
  harbours and airstrips . 
  incidentally , the brits then handed iceland off to us ` peacekeepers ' so they could, 
  * free up manpower, 
  * give the us a staging base in the european theatre should the brits convince the yanks to join in, 
  * force the germans to think * really hard * about whether invading iceland was worth it, 
  there 's a difference between being transparent in your dealings with others , and wearing saran wrap instead of clothes . 
  it was a recurring question in their ama . 
  i thought i had a good swim at a sydney beach . 
  turns out i was just going through the motions . 
  soon ^ tm, 
  i think it 's fair to say you should reassess your approach to advertising . 
  maybe hook up with some guys from the whirlpool forums . 
  yeah there 's a eve thread in there somewhere . 
  i fly with al3x . 
  they 're a bunch of mad kiwis plus one mad englishman . 
  bananas in pyjamas is entirely funded from distribution rights and dvd sales . 
  that 's why there is n't a new season this year ; evidently networks in other countries would rather air reruns than sign up for new episodes . 
  drink a lot of gatorade . 
  i think the most important thing is to have dust players force eve players to care about them . 
  case in point : fw contracts in dust spawn where there is a lot of plexing in eve . 
  and yet , there 's no benefit to the dust players if their side wins ; the territorial control buffs only go to eve players . 
  if dust players could initiate battles and actually flip occupancy of a system , * then * there 'd be an impact . 
  ccp has [ acknowledged the issue ] ( http://dustsearch.com/thread/92763/page/1#3 ) . 
  true ; the entire point of sov is that defense is entirely up to the owning alliance , but a defense * is * possible . 
  i feel your pain . 
  ccp is working on matchmaking at the moment , at least for public matches . 
  i feel a bit bad about encountering people in pub matches then one-shotting them with a scrambler rifle and finding out they were militia fit , but since many good players also run flimsy suits in pub matches to maximise their isk gain , it 's hard to give the enemy leeway . 
  three or four ? 
  try eight :(, 
  improved matchmaking may fix this . 
  lowsec ded sites , obviously . 
  sure . 
  6/10 and up might be a bit rough , depending on the pirate type , but they should be quite achievable . 
  i do n't know if you 've realised it , but vote counting scales really , really well . 
  the aec will just throw more pensioners at the problem . 
  a more exploration-specific fit would be [ this one ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) but note that the shield booster is incredibly expensive so feel free to use b - or c-type instead . 
  personally , i 'd go with a [ 5-launcher fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#tank ) and dial back the tank and gank to free up some mid slots for exploration stuff . 
  voting scales fairly well . 
  just open more booths , or failing that , sit people at separate benches . 
  because every time someone tries this , shady shit starts happening . 
  manually counting physical pieces of paper is cheap to set up and operate , easy to understand , easy to audit , massively parallel and involves lots of people all checking up on each other . 
  it 's a lot better than [ hanging chads ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chad_%28paper%29 ) , [ hackers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premier_election_solutions#security_and_concealment_issues ) , [ security fuckups ] ( http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3449691?headline=diebold~to~settle~with~california ) or [ pressure from the boss ] ( http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0828-08.htm ) to fudge numbers . 
  necessary , but not [ sufficient ] ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?thekenthompsonhack ) . 
  you also need to check that, 
  * that version is the same version that got deployed to the voting machine, 
  * the firmware or hardware has n't been deliberately tampered with, 
  * there 's no way to flash a new version onto the machine when nobody is looking ( which actually happened in the us because the fucking things were networked ),
