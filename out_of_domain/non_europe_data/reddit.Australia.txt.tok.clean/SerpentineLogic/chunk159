  * if the machines * are * networked , you 're basically fucked because the amount of tampering that can be done rises exponentially, 
  if a vegas slot machine is tampered with , the casino gets hit with a loss , slot machine company gets sued and everyone loses money . 
  if a voting machine is tampered with , nothing much happens except the company [ changes names ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premier_election_solutions#name_change_and_acquisition_by_election_systems_.26_software ) to avoid the bad publicity . 
  after all , it 's only * votes * , right ? 
  imo , blueprints for advanced gear is a case of short-term money over long-term health of the game . 
  being able to opt out of the economy is generally a bad idea - far better to directly buy isk with cash ( i.e. 
  plex style ) to keep the economy healthy . 
  this was a good post . 
  ammo via nanohives , drop uplinks for respawning in designated locations , scanners for intel-gathering , demolitions/anti-tank duties etc.

  hmm , how bout [ pc games ] ( http://www.pcgamesn.com/eve/eve-online-ship-worth-309-billion-isk-goes-flames-comms-goes-wild ) ? 
   here 's what pandemic legion 's comms sounded like in the immediate aftermath . 
  i 'd recommend the first part for the exchange that emerges between the `` giddy '' jeffraider and his furious commander , graff , and sixteen minutes in for the moment of realisation . 
  be warned that the language is consistently blue and in places offensive :, 
   jeff : `` no need to totally be super dupe mad . 
  everyone who lost a ship , i 'm sure they feel pretty bad about it . 
  let 's just go play chivalry or something . 
  how about that . '', 
   graff : `` motherfucker , jeff . '', 
   jeff : `` sorry , but i 'm just not that mad about it . 
  it 's kind of fucked to say and it 's wrong , but i feel kind of giddy ` cos we just lost the most money in supers that 's ever been lost in the game forever ... do n't be mad , at least be giddy ` cos you lost a lot of shit fucking quickly . 
  is that about 50 bil a minute that we lost ? 
  ` cos that 's really fucking good . 
  is n't that nice ? '', 
   graff : `` i fucking hate you , asshole . '', 
   jeff : `` we should keep going and see how many titans we can lose in ten minutes , because there 's records to be broken . '', 
   in the event pandemic did n't go back for more , but they 'd already got the attention of ccp . 
   `` that 's a lot of billions of isk to lose , '' the developers tweeted . 
  `` somewhere [ fictional in-game messiah ] sansha himself is shedding a tear . 
  it 's more british than american . 
  well , lots of people [ do n't know about `` smart '' ] ( http://i.qkme.me/3rhlvd.jpg ) . 
  a decade ago ? 
  try last month :-(, 
  zero , because we can borrow at the bond rate and pay it back from the profits . 
  it 's almost as if they planned it . 
  in that case , the nbn is free !, 
  so you 're saying that you 'd need an `` isk fountain '' to pay for it ? 
  dat dps boost . 
  +1 * did * read again . 
  right in the pathos . 
  no word on whether all rails will be buffed , or just medium rails . 
  : popcorn :, 
  fixed aim , plus radius increased from 3m to 4m . 
  does your tool work out the price-per-unit of applying each decryptor ? 
  that would be neat . 
  bonus points if it suggests which one to use without prompting . 
  yes . 
  he married liz hurley . 
  it 's the one thing i miss about eve-market-guide . com . 
  does 1500 count as stockpiling ? 
  true . 
  sometimes i care about isk/hour ; other times i care about unit cost . 
  my personal preference is to buff proximity mines and remove the homing from av grenades . 
  this makes av grenades much better against tanks than lavs , but makes light vehicles much more wary of going through obvious choke points . 
  i would rather unsubscribe than be forced to login to eve once a day . 
  do n't forget the connections skill , which boosts your initial standings a great deal when you 're starting out . 
  but the invention in the middle of my screen so it obscures the totals :(, 
  also it would probably be reasonable to have an extra line in the first table showing the invention cost per run with the current settings , since many products ' profitability is completely erased by invention costs . 
  i heard that ccp are designing speeders ( i.e. 
  one-person bikes ) . 
  presumably they will fare much worse in a collision ... 
  having unlimited bikes seems like a better idea than unlimited taxis . 
  i always downgrade the weapon , except in pc matches . 
  advanced suit ? 
  standard weapon . 
  advanced weapon . 
  keeps advanced fits under 30k , and proto fits under 100k . 
  the guy on the left just graduated from the academy . 
  it 's still not good . 
  normal x-rays will generally go through you ( except for bones etc ) . 
  while they are higher powered , most of the energy is not absorbed by you . 
  millimetre back-scatter x-rays will be absorbed by your skin . 
  it 's lower powered , but you get all of it . 
  i 'd choose a pat-down as well . 
  after all , if i 'm forced into an uncomfortable situation , the least i can do is make guy who 's feeling me up feel just as awkward . 
   back-scatter x-rays, 
   unlike cell phone signals , or millimeter-wave scanners , the energy being emitted by a backscatter x-ray is a type of ionizing radiation that breaks chemical bonds . 
  ionizing radiation is considered carcinogenic even in very small doses but at the doses used in airport scanners this effect is believed to be negligible for an individual . 
  [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] if 1 million people were exposed to 520 scans in one year , one study estimated that roughly four additional cancers would occur due to the scanner , in contrast to the 600 additional cancers that would occur from the higher levels of radiation during flight . 
  however even with this exposure no can can guarantee that an individual would not develop cancer as a result of a scan and that individual would have to deal with the pain and anguish and possible death from the cancer at their expense . 
  if you read the article , there 's a lot of back and forth on the issue . 
  ah yes , [ \u00deorrabl\u00f3t ] ( http://www.tentonhammer.com/eve/news/ccp-video-celebrates-the-thorrablot-midwinter-feast ) . 
  frankly , that 's pretty shit . 
  depends what they were trying to scan him with . 
  the competing technology , [ millimetre wave scanners ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millimeter_wave_scanner ) , does n't cause cancer . 
  a better idea is to say things critical of the other party , and in support , and make sure prospective voters hear whichever statements you want them to hear . 
  that too . 
  i have an undistributed middle , probably from sitting down playing spaceships instead of exercising . 
  it 's just that it 's a modal dialog that ca n't be repositioned or resized , which makes it a bit awkward . 
  nine . 
  hundred . 
  trillion . 
  that 's $ 27m if converted to plex . 
  so , next you tie it into the transactions api ? 
  yeah , i buy farm animals via oxfam for my parents ' birthday presents . 
  `` happy birthday mum . 
  i got you a goat . '', 
  looks like there were contact grenades on both sides .
