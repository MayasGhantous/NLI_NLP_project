  * astrometric acquisition to boost your scan strength towards 100 %, 
  * astrometric pinpointing to stop signatures moving around so much, 
  * astrometric rangefinding to scan faster ( optional but convenient ), 
  when i was ninja salvaging , i just launched one deep space probe and seven combat probes . 
  the deep space probe covered the entire solar system , and i used the other probes to get hits on whichever ship was easiest to scan . 
  i was n't after a tasty ship to bait ; i was actually after the salvage . 
   this game was like , designed by an aspergers patient for autistic people to enjoy . 
  i think you 'll find that it was designed by a sociopath , not an aspie . 
  the key thing about incursions is that the rewards scale with the players involved , rather than being split * n * ways , like missions . 
  putting that game mechanic in more places would be a great way to foster multiplayer pve ( multiplayer pvp is already well-established , although personally i do n't count off-grid warfare link boosters as multiplayer ), 
  for a newbie , getting hardcopy of isk : is worth it unless you have a tablet already . 
  magazine i 'd get the ebook version unless you are a massive eve news junkie and already have inside scoops on everything in the mag . 
  i 'm not saying she 's not a good actor , but the director should n't have been satisfied with her delivery of those lines . 
  unless it 's daniel craig playing bond ; he 's screwed then . 
  if you 're interested in incursions , people will happily take a basilisk pilot , since they ~ ~ rarely ~ ~ never have fewer than two logistics pilots per fleet . 
  in small-fleet actions , you often see t2 gallente hulls , or gank talos fits . 
  in larger fleet operations , not so much , although railguns do have a niche use . 
  being able to fly more than one race makes you nerf-proof . 
   and , do i have to be specialize in one thing ? 
  i like pvp but a also want to explore/mine . 
  probably best to make separate characters for mining . 
  the skill overlap makes it not worth adding mining skills to an otherwise-combat-specced character . 
  you have my permission . 
  til why world leaders [ do this ] ( http://sturgeonface.com/ ) . 
  we must go deeper . 
  whoever gets your first vote gets a small amount of money from the electoral commission ( presumably for advertising ) , once they reach a certain number of votes . 
  so , vote 1 < the party you like  . 
  vegemite is concentrated beer , so your analogy holds . 
   what should i go for and what weapons should i go for, 
   my race is amarr, 
  ( fyi just because your race is amarr does n't mean you 're locked into amarr ships . 
  having said that , [ amarr ships are pretty good ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/amarr_basic_ship_and_skill_guide ) ), 
  the basic amarr ships that are popular are :, 
  * [ punisher ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/punisher ) ( frigate ) . 
  very tough . 
  * [ arbitrator ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/arbitrator ) ( cruiser ) . 
  versatile cruiser , but uses drones . 
  if you prefer to stick with lasers for now , choose an [ omen ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/omen ) instead . 
  * [ harbinger ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/harbinger ) ( battlecruiser ) . 
  very good performance for its cost, 
  * all of the amarr battleships are good , but it will take you a while to skill up for them , since they need quite a lot of support skills else their capacitors run dry . 
  as far as skills required , i suggest looking at the certificates required for each ship you want , then training the appropriate skills . 
  if you want to skip ahead of that plan , prioritise these modules :, 
  * [ medium pulse laser ii ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=3512 ) ( requires tech 2 small lasers ), 
  * [ medium armor repairer ii ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=3530 ), 
  * [ armor < x  hardener ii ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=11646 ) ( although tech 1 are still good ), 
  * [ capacitor recharger ii ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=2032 ), 
  * [ afterburners ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=6005 ), 
  snipe play style : any of the tier three battlecruisers will work for this , although the oracle and tornado are seeing the most use , from what i 've seen ( naga has best damage projection though ), 
  stealth play style : any of the force recon ships will work for this . 
   care to fill me in on what 's happened since ? 
  you know how five years ago , you looked at your bank balance and thought , `` the exchange rate is going to smash me when i move countries '' ? 
  yeah , it 's gon na happen again when you move back to oz . 
  you forgot a step . 
  login to account management, 
  select ` hours for plex ', 
  *** cry at the price of plex on market ***, 
  buy plex , apply to account, 
  nice try , orson scott card . 
  i think you 'll find that forsaken hubs do n't . 
  * [ invention stuff ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=1067 ) needed, 
  * [ material efficiency breakpoints ] ( http://zofu.no-ip.de/bpo?db=cru10b&amp;patt=1mn microwarp ), 
  these days , i open the assets view , the rightclick the heading of where i have my stuff , then click ` set destination ' . 
  i love how you can autopilot all the way into a station now . 
  ( i also stash 1 tritanium in stations as pseudo-bookmarks ), 
  kudos for coming here and asking instead of giving up , btw . 
  perhap something [ like this ] ( http://www.eve-market-guide.com/t2item.php?id=440 ) , then ? 
   people considered slights to their honor to be the greatest form of disrespect . 
  being labelled dishonorable was a big deal , then . 
  need a bank loan ? 
  nope . 
  ask for a man 's daughter 's hand in marriage ? 
  nope . 
  without being seen as honorable , a man is effectively kicked out of the upper class , and their hold on the middle class is only as sure as their financial resources ( which are also now in considerably more peril , because good investment opportunities ? 
  nope ), 
  have you seen the us healthcare system ? 
  it 's already pretty bad . 
  the usa has the best healthcare in the world , provided you can afford it . 
  for the 99 % , it 's worse than a lot of developed countries . 
  on which side ? 
  think carefully ; my upvote is * at stake * here . 
  that 's going straight to the pool room . 
  reminds me of the joke . 
  man hobbles into a doctor 's office , crouched over in pain . 
  in the examination room , he pulls down his pants to reveal that his genitals are swollen to epic proportions , and covered in welts . 
  the doctor says , `` what happened ? '', 
  the patient replies `` i was on my way home and rode my bicycle into a bee 's nest . '', 
  `` ah , '' the doctor says . 
  `` i 'll give you an anti inflammatory and that should fix everything . '', 
  the man exclaims . 
  `` give me something for the pain , sure , '' he lowers his voice , '' ** but can i keep the swelling ** ? '', 
  i hate to break it to you , but time does that already . 
  standard and poors . 
  * `` we have standards , so you do n't have to . 
  your smugness is inspirational !, 
  if i had your character , i would train, 
  * all proteus subsystem skills to v , because they 're worth it . 
  * recon ships v , unless you just roll with a proteus instead, 
  * graviton physics v for tech 2 infinipoint , because i assume you have a phobos in your carrier bay . 
  * hybrid rigging iv for tech 2 rigs,
