  uprising 1.3 is a big balance pass . 
  flaylocks are n't immune from it . 
  if you have marketable skills , you can always get a working holiday visa in another country . 
  try before you buy , so to speak . 
  \\* cough \\* working holiday \\* cough \\*, 
  also , plan to emigrate before you 're 30 . 
  after that it gets a lot harder to get in . 
  protip : nobody lives in the desert parts of australia , except for obscenely-paid mining company employees . 
  just do n't ever get the no added sugar variety . 
  that 's poison to taste buds . 
  south australia was free settlers . 
  they have a slight british accent to this day . 
  an eve player 's `` house '' is called a pos . 
  that 's why we really , * really * want the pos upgrade to be developed . 
  jet packs are go, 
  and a strip club !, 
  tldr overview bug . 
  say what you like about gevlon but a donation board is a great idea for care bears who will never be good on a real kill board . 
  best of luck . 
  from what i can tell , the usa is not a good place to live if you 're poor or sick . 
  there 's one station they wo n't be going to , though ...

  same in dust . 
  the japanese corps have really high unit cohesion and coordination . 
  in a 1v1 fight they 'll often lose , but they make sure that most of their fights are 6v1 instead . 
  that would just make him angry - . 
  i think the * concept * of soil sequestration has real merit . 
  got a macadamia nut farm and do n't know what to do with the shells ? 
  turn them into charcoal and spread it around your farm , maybe run a generator with the biogas it produces . 
  however , the * large-scale industry * of soil sequestration seems a lot more difficult . 
  finding enough biomass , moving the quantity of biomass to where it can be charred , moving the char to where it can be accepted in large amounts , all for $ 24/tonne soon dropping to $ 6/tonne is a hell of a lot of work for little gain . 
  i guess it 's the difference between having a compost bin in your garden to recycle scraps , and running a food-scrap-recycling business where your end product is worth $ 6/tonne . 
  margaret river is pretty nice . 
  it 's a little bit like napa valley . 
  musk lifesavers . 
  ribena . 
  bundaberg ginger beer . 
  four small shield extenders do little to help your tank , by the way . 
   if everyone does it, 
  the detention centres are run by serko , a private company . 
  they 're not doing it out of pure altruism . 
  cheaper for who ? 
  certainly not serko . 
  they 're being paid per inmate per day . 
  i did some theorycrafting that repair hives would compensate for the low regen of armor tanks . 
  in practice , they all died to the first mass driver , grenade or flaylock to come along . 
  welp . 
  unlikely . 
  even the smallest flux will deal 1000 damage to equipment . 
  afaik no deployable equipment has more than 500hp . 
  literally 47 minutes ago . 
  turns out the technical issue is that once a piece of equipment gets deployed on the ground , any bonuses it 's supposed to get from the suit do n't work . 
  this implies that each of the suits will get bonuses to some type of equipment ... 
  maybe, 
  * amarr : uplinks ? 
  * caldari : injectors ? 
  * gallente : hives ? 
  * minmatar : remote explosives ? 
  repair tools ? 
  logistics = equipment , not necessarily repairs . 
  i mean , what would a caldari suit do with a repair tool in a shield squad ?

   mar 17 , 2008 - in this thesis , i examine the economic systems revolving around production ... transaction and production data from the logs of eve online ... 
  or just [ look here ] ( http://www.mendeley.com/groups/555851/virtual-economy-research-network/papers/ ) . 
  highs : 4 extenders , or 3 extenders + 1 energizer, 
  lows : 2 regulators , 1 plate , one stamina module . 
  swap out a regulator for a cpu module if you run low . 
  or maybe it gets a bonus to deployable shield bubbles . 
  there does n't need to be an * exact * equivalent for everything . 
  yeah it seems a bit off . 
  part of the reason people afk is to hit the cap . 
  make the cap roll over if not used in a week and you can be a lot tougher with afk players . 
  it can be expanded . 
  i believe there are even plans to do this . 
  looking up my blueprints is neither here nor there ; i have drk for the actual production tracking . 
  what i use your tool for is speculative investigation , i.e. 
  `` is it worth running off some copies to make siege module iis or is it a waste of time ? '', 
  for this , my skills ( either in cookie or api ) are important , although i guess you can assume all skills at iv if not provided . 
  given the low cost of most blueprints used in invention , the key component i 'm missing is a way to say `` here 's my skills , what should i be inventing to make the most isk/hour and/or per-unit profit ? '', 
  with enough information about buy/sell spreads and transaction volume to avoid cluttering the toplist with small sentry damage rigs . 
  i like failheap , myself , but you might not have reached the minimum bitterness threshold required to post there . 
  i have a staff recruiter assault dropsuit , so i guess my recruit and i can each run around in free militia suits now . 
  fair enough . 
  brb cis male privilege-checking . 
  you have been nominated for best pwn of the day . 
  remember that the melee bonus does not apply to nova knives ... 
  so to speak . 
  when you run out of charges , you have the option of using ( a lot of ) capacitor . 
  then buy from a thrift shop . 
  they get heaps of donated items when they actually need * money * to buy what they need . 
  i did nazi that coming . 
  incidentally , that area has been conquered over and over by franc e and germany , since it lies on the eastern side of the mountains between the two countries and thus is hard to defend by the french . 
  to this day they have a slight accent . 
  most polite ` you 're dead wrong ' ever . 
  you should have been there for the [ heyday of the breach shotgun ] ( http://themittani.com/media/dust-514-gameplay-meet-kr-17 ) . 
  prom was really carving it up that patch . 
  yeah there 's something vaguely distasteful about the whole thing . 
   even if we were losing why would we want to burn ourselves out with : effort : while n3 is doing all the heavy lifting for us .
