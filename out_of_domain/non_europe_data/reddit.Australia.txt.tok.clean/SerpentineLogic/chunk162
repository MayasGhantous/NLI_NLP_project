  i 'll take `` things not to say in public '' for 400 . 
  no ; he 's just being an idiot . 
  the $ 20 mercenary pack is great value , but i 'd hold off on more expensive purchases . 
  1 . stop using expensive weapons . 
  swap to a standard assault rifle , or a free one if you have a blueprint . 
  fit for durability . 
  this means shield extenders in the high slots and a basic armor plate plus basic repairer in the low slots . 
  do n't waste money . 
  do n't spend more than 16k on a basic frame + fitout , or 35k on an advanced frame . 
  fit equipment and use it . 
  if you 're using an assault rifle , that probably means nanohives to resupply your ammo and that of the rest of the squad . 
  also it 's free war points , which is nice . 
  fit different suits for different roles . 
  sometimes , you need to get to the side of the map , so you should have a militia scout suit with a drop uplink and a kinetic catalyzer to run there . 
  similarly , an anti-tank suit with a swarm launcher will help fend off vehicles if they 're causing you grief . 
  skill up appropriately . 
  there 's guides , [ read them ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/index.php?title=the_newberry%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy#which_skills_to_get ) . 
  if you 're not in a player-run corporation , join pick-up squads inside each game and learn the ropes . 
  you 'll have a lot more fun when a firefight breaks out if it 's a 6v6 instead of a 1v6 . 
  get in a corporation . 
  being able to squad up with corpmates is a great thing , and makes things so much more enjoyable . 
  plus , you get to learn a lot about the game from what they do and how they do it . 
  change roles . 
  if you decide that you 're actually terrible at aiming , then choose roles that do n't require aiming . 
  plant remote explosives . 
  use auto-targeting weapons like swarm launchers and repair tools . 
  run around the place dropping drop uplinks and spamming the scanner . 
  heck , drive a vehicle ( i hear they 're much easier on a ps3 controller than mouse and keyboard ) . 
  i 'm sure the sample size would be bigger if people did n't keep stealing the goddamn * spoons * . 
  ^ ( ok i 've calmed down now . ), 
  it 's what we in the antipodes call a ` break room ' . 
  we australians do our breaking in the outback , or [ occasionally in south africa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breaker_morant ) . 
  this week on the marketplace , we have the following items :, 
  \u2022 [ ` neo ' assault g-i - 60 aur ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/carousel_2_neo_assault_std_23072013.jpg ), 
  \u2022 [ ` blastwave ' 9k330 forge gun -- ~ ~ 40 aur ~ ~ 24 aur \\ [ -40 % \\ ] ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/carousel_1_blastwave_forgegun_23072013.jpg ), 
  \u2022 [ ` neo ' logistics c/1 series - 80 aur ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/carousel_3_neo_logistic_adv_23072013.jpg ), 
  \u2022 [ ` fractal ' a/7 repair tool -- ~ ~ 30 aur ~ ~ 21 aur \\ [ -30 % \\ ] ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/repairtool.jpg ), 
  \u2022 [ ` bedlam ' m512-a submachine gun -- 20 aur ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/carousel_5_bedlam_submachinegun_23072013.jpg ), 
  \u2022 [ battle kits promotion ] ( http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/dust/news.control/64934/1/topright_battlekit.png ) [ [ psn bundle ] ( http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/07/22/dust-514-suit-up-and-roll-out-with-new-battle-kits/ ) ], 
  the battle kits being $ 1 and $ 2 is a neat price point . 
  my sin is gas can fit . 
  choose a pi alt instead . 
  you can get one done in about 800k skill points . 
  there 's heaps of low tax customs offices in low sec near jita . 
  you just need to go looking . 
  have you considered doing one for dust ? 
  hmm , was expecting a bit more balancing actually . 
  fingers crossed , then . 
  `` i guess you would call it ... '', 
  `` the spin cycle '', 
  whatever works . 
  you 're at least 4 hours behind europe for sunsets . 
  i mean , i like being stuck inside with a computer for long periods of time , but * come on * . 
  no word on padded headrests or mp3 player yet . 
  need moar to decide . 
  that would work . 
  you 'll have to explain what that is . 
  we do n't have any coin smaller than 5c . 
  i 'm sure you have mountains of freedom , the same way we have mountains of iron ore . 
  nothing new , but nothing especially unpalatable . 
  julie bishops record does n't speak ; it stares hard at you until * you * say something . 
  when things are going to plan , you can drop three orbital strikes in the same match . 
  for some reason , that seems to really piss off the other team . 
  is the graph for the assault rifle substantially different from the scrambler ? 
  `` some butts were hurt during filming of this skirmish '', 
  i was hoping the scrambler would have a bunch more optimal range than an ar . 
  then he should know not to smash wine glasses in a guy 's * face * . 
  it 's usually fairly quick , but if it takes ages ( 24hrs + ) then you have a case for raising another petition once you get unbanned to get the time you lost added to your subscription . 
  i believe the idea is that if your company sends you to another city , you 're on the job until your tax drops you back to your house and thus your employer 's insurance is strictly liable ( workcover insurance is mandatory in australia ) . 
  the idea is that in situations like these , the employer 's insurer goes after the hotel 's insurer and something is worked out , but the employee gets their compensation regardless . 
  the whole point of the compensation claim was that it 's not her responsibility to do that ; it 's her employer 's insurer who should pay her , then it can go after the hotel . 
  yo dawg , i heard you like lasers so i put a laser on your laser so you can scope it out while you 're scoped . 
  workcover is uniformly excellent . 
  i hope you 're bulletproof . 
  or live outside the usa . 
  [ of course not ~ ] ( http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2013/04/frat_party_gone_awry_five_arre.php ), 
  i 'm not convinced you 're fantastic , either . 
  that 's also being fixed . 
  nobody thinks of the poor train driver who has a front row seat . 
  our patience . 
  eight hours seems excessive . 
  sort by best is the [ xkcd-approved choice ] ( http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html ) . 
  $ 75/month seems high . 
  i pay less than that , and i live in australia , home of expensive internet things '' . 
  i see :(, 
  we have two semi-competing cable networks ( it 's very rare that you can choose between one or the other , but both companies have a presence in each city ) , but dsl is a fairly decent market - one company has a monopoly on the line access , but any company can pay them for line rental and charge for actual phone and/or internet access . 
  i think [ churn ] ( http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/what_is_rapid_transfer_or_churn ) is fairly easy too . 
  it 's just the data that 's expensive . 
  usually we get 50g quota and then drop to modem speeds . 
  in 1.4 , all mouse aim assist is gone . 
  my personal favourite things to do in eve in pairs :, 
  * dual-tengu spider tanking in class 3 or 4 wormholes, 
  * running ded complexes with a mate , preferably a marauder or noctis so he can hoover up loot, 
  * running a ship scanner scout + tornado gank combo in highsec, 
  * being the only two logistics ships in an eleven-man incursion fleet, 
  * abusing corpmates until they light cynos for me, 
  the graph is percentage per shot ; not really applicable to real dps . 
  margera !, 
  seventeen hours later , score still hidden . 
  not cool .
