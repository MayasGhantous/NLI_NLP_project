  to be fair , a lot of that legislation came about because she happened to be in power when the rudd - initiated inquiries delivered their recommendations . 
  nope . 
  rudd is facing stiff opposition . 
  i have a few channels you can ask for squads . 
  what 's your character name ? 
  i 'm not sure they stopped that tank , actually . 
  cleared up . 
  only ones left are in this thread . 
  privatisation worked okay for the adsl market . 
  it did n't work for electricity . 
  i wasted mine on five hobgoblin ii . 
  a real apology , or just `` i 'm sorry you 're so bad at this game ? '', 
  sent . 
  i use the back end of the spoon vov . 
  i am tempted to get a chromecast for just this reason . 
  if only there were things called '' [ real estate investment trusts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_real_estate_investment_trust ) '' that you could dump that $ 50k into , instead of buying an actual house . 
  res has you at +16 , so i am contractually obligated to agree with you . 
  i imagine the armor timer is next on their agenda . 
  sure , i 'm up for a random draw . 
  it 's because of all the other ships counting as well . 
  all that counting going on uses a lot of computer power . 
   all that 's required is to stay classy, 
  welp :(, 
  quite frankly , what it would do would be to reduce chicken numbers drastically , especially non-laying breeds . 
  i mean , how many people besides farmers have sheep or cattle ? 
  not too many . 
  is n't that one cyno from stacmon ? 
  you 're sufficiently active to parachute into / r/evedreddit and apply . 
  any alliance on [ the map ] ( http://dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/verite/influence.png ) has a stake in the game of sovereignty . 
  sov warfare is generally at a larger scale than single-corp warfare . 
  ten hours is the traditional threshold . 
  also great background music . 
  rob dougan . 
  every time . 
  ah , the long con . 
  i * wo n't * miss having to ramp up my mouse sensitivity when scoped . 
  i would never consider the first three points put into assault rifle to be useless . 
  i might not go to v , but it 's a useful , generic weapon that you probably already have a blueprint for , so it will turn up on a lot of cheap fits you run with . 
  goonswarm does not recruit from existing eve players ( except for scams ) . 
  dreddit is the largest reddit-based eve corporation . 
  it 's [ fairly big ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/dreddit ) , and involved in sov warfare . 
  there are a [ few ] ( / r/bravenewbies ) [ other ] ( / r/fweddit ) reddit-based corps , but they tend to do different things . 
  they 're old , but [ mirrors ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?pwoaqrxdxqhmy16 ) [ exist ] ( http://www.2shared.com/document/qygmrpua/sarah_overview_pack_024.html ) . 
  standard-grade scanners do n't pick up scouts . 
  [ to every eve newbie : 9 things to know about eve before you jump in ( self.eve ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ), 
  [ fixed ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzv5f0i0pz1qbs6ydo1_500.jpg ), 
  the methods detailed in breaking bad almost but do n't quite work , for fairly obvious reasons . 
  scram is fairly balanced - it 's not as easy to use as the assault rifle , but you can pull off some trick shots with the charge . 
  the assault scram is functionally similar to the assault rifle if you find you need some short-ranged punch . 
  the lr has really bad tracking when scoped ( plus its a bad scope ) , which might be the core of your problem . 
  it also has a really strange damage curve which takes some getting used to . 
  i believe they 're fixing it next month - until then , just practice waving it over people like a wand . 
  more advanced sniper rifles have better zoom . 
  do n't you have drones ? 
  i do n't know about australia , but american congressmen are immune to insider trading laws . 
  not every game will require ps plus to get online . 
  most , but not sll, 
  also , ambush and oms are merged into the same instant battle queue . 
  personally , i think ccp 's concept of `` flaylocks = skillshot weapon '' and `` flaylocks dealing 85 % of their direct damage in splash '' just do n't work well together . 
  would it be possible to dial down the persecution complex please . 
  medics in tf2 seem to do fine being squishier than almost everyone else . 
  they 're a support class and they stick to their role . 
  now , the scram pistol is a skillshot weapon . 
  headshots are ridiculous with that thing , but it 's fairly difficult to pull off at pistol ranges anyway . 
  the flaylock seems to have some weird hodge-podge of abilities for no reason :, 
  * high alpha, 
  * high rof, 
  * splash, 
  * high splash %, 
  * high optimal range , no falloff, 
  all apparently balanced by, 
  some of those attributes are by design ; others , such as the high optimal/zero falloff , are due to fluff reasons `` it 's a small missile '' . 
  ccp needs to have a long think about weapon roles , especially since they know what the missing racial weapon niches are supposed to be . 
  life [ finds a way ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/rorqual ) . 
  * something something +1 hp to dropsuit armor repair rate per level . 
  all logistics suits have this bonus , along with their race-specific bonus . 
  i can barely handle the 4.8 speed of amarr assaults as it is , let alone slowed down by plates . 
  seem fair . 
  i mean , who 's going to rezz the logi if * he 's * the only guy with an injector ? 
  the idea is to compress the heck out of your unrefined ore with the rorqual , then jump to a lowsec system with refining capabilities and refine it with zero corp fees ( or use a jump freighter if you want to keep plausible deniability ), 
  exactly . 
  it just goes to making a consistent game first , then adjusting the story to accommodate it . 
  never bet against the finkel . 
  i take it you lovingly store every grocery store catalog you 've ever received , too ? 
  or perhaps you judge books based on their perceived merit , like everyone else . 
  but putting cats on is what reddit is *** for *** . 
  what do you mean '' ** you people ** '' ? 
  sony learned its lesson : when you have credible competition , do n't stiff your customers . 
  they [ said that ] ( http://www.geek.com/games/blu-ray-laser-led-to-blame-for-ps3-shortage-563113/ ) , but that only affects supply , not pricing , especially at the stupid volumes that sony would order them at . 
  heck , it 's a laser , not a 300dpi screen . 
  boom !,

  worst . 
  michele bachmann 's husband runs a conversion therapy business and , unless i and many other people are badly mistaken , he 's quite , quite gay . 
  i think she 's crazy enough not to notice . 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but if everyone on reddit gave you $ 10 you could buy an airline . 
  this logic appeals to me . 
  nobody told him they drive on the other side of the road in australia . 
  if you believe that , i have a bridge to sell you . 
  nope , dust patch was yesterday .
