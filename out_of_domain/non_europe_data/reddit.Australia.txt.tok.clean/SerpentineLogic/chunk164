  anyway , it 's apparently up now . 
  if it 's * this * bridge , yes . 
  and the decks that came out of the beach housewere terrible to boot . 
  man , i loved donais u5c from that period . 
  \\  implying chris dowd has any pulling power in the us, 
  bandwagoning did n't stop ; people just upvoted or downvoted based on where a comment was sorted on the page . 
  minmatar suits are still good ; you may find that getting complex shield extenders really help your resilience . 
   the curve is no more different than the difference between gonewild and gonewildcurvy once you 're experienced with it . 
  you have a way with words . 
  jaywalking * is too * enforced in brisbane . 
  not necessarily . 
  comments that are new usually show up at the bottom , but they are still getting unnecessary downvotes . 
  incursions work well to start with . 
  after that , move onto real fights . 
  soon ^ tm, 
  oh , is * that * what i feel trickling onto my head . 
  tears . 
  he 's in goonfeet ; it 's not as if he 'll be submitting to en24 . 
  no installations at all ? 
  that seems a bit lame . 
  at least put in a supply depot or a blaster turret or something . 
  your points are , for the most part , quite valid . 
  your character will continue to gain passive skill points ; i hope you come back in a couple months and see how things are then . 
  i do n't always tolerate recruitment links in posts , but when i do , i appreciate the artistry . 
  i would definitely record them , especially if you have something with a pre-record buffer so you do n't miss the last ten seconds of ranting while you turn it on . 
  even if it 's inadmissable as evidence , you capture everything for your own , written record of what happened . 
  you evemail [ namamai ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/namamai ) and send him isk . 
  he will then release a patch for an existing eft install , like he has done for all the other devblogs . 
  ccp have said that there will be no further resets . 
  at most , they might refund you all the points you put into certain skills if they radically change the skill tree , so you can reallocate them in the new structure . 
  his passive sp accrues regardless , so it 's no biggie if he has a break . 
  heck , once uprising 1.0 came out i took a `` holy shit aiming sucks '' vacation , myself . 
  i do n't want much ; just a way to set people on fire . 
  ha , [ neat ] ( http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/23/new-ios-app-lets-you-record-what-you-heard-five-minutes-ago/ ) . 
  [ vov ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=3023205#post3023205 ), 
  maybe probe/cloak/tractor or probe/cloak/salvager ? 
  he clicks everything . 
  this is reddit you know . 
  no , because the water turns into pee . 
  send the video to him anyway , to annoy him :-p, 
  vehicles ? 
  he 's in a c5.i think he 's well set for fights . 
  maybe a hundred a month for middle-tier cover ? 
  i would love a double jump module . 
  also , hats . 
  however , you get your full bonus , regardless of what level of suit you wear . 
  so , with skill level 3 you will get the same bonus with standard or advanced minmatar assault suits . 
  what 's scary is that a logistics suit could probably drop all that in a single loadout . 
  in the rest of the world , musk is strictly a perfume . 
  please post a follow up thread if you can . 
  sounds like he just hated naughty kids . 
  a partial list was `` accidentally '' leaked to a few alliances who were nominally fighting against test in the recent war . 
  i presume those were then forwarded to dotlan . 
  but seriously , trusting public data for stuff like this is a bit risky . 
  chances are that  95 % of the high-ends really are where dotlan says they are ; it 's all the * other * ones that are conveniently forgotten and remain under the radar . 
  why do they need to steal it ? 
  people *** give it *** to them . 
  if they ever rmt 'd it , they could buy a * house * . 
  buying market share is a legitimate strategy , provided you can afford it . 
  work out the cost difference between the cost and sale price of an item you have the bpc for . 
  here 's one for a [ reactive armor hardener ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/4403/0/5/0/1 ) , and another for the [ blood small pulse laser battery ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/27634/0/5/0/1 ) . 
  fiddle with the material efficiency if your bpc has a positive or negative me . 
  multiply the profit by the number of runs on your bpc . 
  this is the ** maximum ** price anyone would be willing to buy your blueprint for . 
  sell it for less than that . 
  ** tldr ; ** sell faction bpcs for whatever you can get ; the rest are practically worthless . 
  graphite 's density is 2.09 -- 2.23 g/cm ^ 3 vs 11.34 for lead . 
  considering that [ ~ 80 % of the weight ] ( http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/2293791 ) of a car battery is because of the lead , an ultracapacitor would definitely be lighter .

  three square males per day . 
  i hope every player who abused this bug gets their account banned . 
  it 's not good to set a precedent for leniency for things like this . 
  i would ask how annoying it is to have the target reticle change from a square to a circle and make your tattoo out of date . 
  then i would ask you why someone so peaceful in eve turns into a cold hearted killer behind the scope of a sniper rifle . 
  also talk about all the omglabs sites , why they were set up , what they do , and what your plans are for them ? 
   what else am i supposed to do while waiting for my morning coffee ? 
  did you leave your phone at home or something ? 
  oh , i 'm going to blow up * so many * installations that week . 
  i would like to know why the weapons in the various vehicle packs are greyed out that way . 
  imo that 's an awful way to grey them out - try a black silhouette with white outline instead next time , [ like this ] ( http://ec.pond5.com/s3/008764106_iconv.jpeg ) .

  the last i heard from him was an apology after the burn jita riots . 
   private debt is different -- you are n't going to be paying it back with other people 's money, 
  unless the ceo owns all the company 's shares , * damn right * he 's going to be paying back loans with other people 's money . 
  for certain personality types , all the ** < x  ** in the world would n't be enough to satisfy them . 
  jon hallur wrote a * lot * of songs for eve .

  absolute idiom made a graph about how many hours it would take to cap out based on a certain number of war points per hour . 
  it 's eye opening how much wp you need to compensate for not having doubled passive in-match sp . 
  you do , however , have to contend with accusations of hypocrisy .

  it is , if you advocate stopping everyone from being educated . 
  the situation is more like my example than yours , and so , yes , he does look like a hypocrite who is attempting to pull up the ladder once he 's climbed it . 
  mine is similar , except i use a damp instead of a rep. 
  i use a compact nanohive if i need repping . 
  they 're still on my shit list for that stunt they pulled on jon finkel .
