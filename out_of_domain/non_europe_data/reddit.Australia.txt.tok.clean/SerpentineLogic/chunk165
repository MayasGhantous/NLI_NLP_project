  nitrogen isotopes were already over 900 when i checked before downtime . 
  i suspect it will work out like this :, 
  customer gives op bitcoins, 
  op gets gtc from ccp via their agreement, 
  op gives code to customer, 
  op frantically sells the bitcoins so they have enough usd for ... 
  ccp gets paid in usd . 
  many gtc resellers offer a year-round 5 % discount code , so i suspect ccp 's wholesale price is at least 10 % below retail . 
  this is how somer blink makes actual rl money - they have so much isk that they can afford to give it away as inducements to buy gtcs from them to get that treee-fiddy in hard currency . 
  because people like discounts ? 
  or get free ships and cerebral accelerators ? 
  or blink credit ? 
  skills shortage ^ tm, 
  eventually links [ here ] ( http://www.kannanir.is/nemendur/index.php?sid=46324&amp;lang=en ) . 
  australian . 
  chances are any snake i encounter is somewhere in the top ten most venomous species in the world . 
  pretty disappointed they ca n't replicate the active scanner jamming bug . 
  my proto swarms with damage mods take of a bare sliver of shields from each hit . 
  it makes me a bit sad :(, 
  i think i would be okay with dust-only corps being hampered in this regard . 
  the concept of a dust-only * corp * makes sense , but not the concept of an * alliance * with no orbital capability . 
  also , if there were more ways to call in off-map support than just bombardments , it would n't be so bad . 
  well , if they have beards on their neck , it should n't matter what sex they are or which gender they represent . 
  yes . 
  next time turn off your mike when you 're logged into mumble . 
  why not subscribe to the dust monthly newsletter ? 
  i would have less trouble believing you if you were n't running a prototype assault rifle as well ... 
  indoor maps would be largely immune to bombardment ... 
  my corp has a fairly laissez-faire approach . 
  * the corp pays for corp assets ( towers , fuel , most blueprints ), 
  * you pay the upkeep ( usually by corp fees for invention and manufacturing jobs , calibrated to pay for fuel ), 
  * if you want a personal tower , we 'll set one up and let you run it , but if it runs out of fuel , tough . 
  all profits beyond the setup cost are yours . 
  [ sons of alexander ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/sons_of_alexander ) is 90 % kiwis . 
  evemail the [ ceo ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/selucid ) , i think there 's other corps in the alliance with less-stringent acceptance criteria . 
  heck , my corp 's recruitment process is pretty simple :, 
  q : do you login more than once a month ? 
  if yes , do n't apply . 
  to be fair , a bunch of us are playing a lot of dust recently . 
  luckily i have corpmates to handle the eve side while i slack off . 
  i do n't understand why you would think that . 
  lots of proteus fits use one . 
  none from us , either . 
  we were n't interested in ditching work all week to play . 
  the circle is complete . 
  strip ii allows use of mining crystals , which boost the yield significantly . 
  people regularly lose combat ships in low sec . 
  mining ships are best used prudently . 
  maybe dip into the water with a mining frigate instead . 
  i was ridiculously good at dust during chromosome , because of the raw mouse input matching my previous experience with tf2 . 
  then they changed the aiming in uprising 1.0 and i started sucking terribly . 
  each patch it seems they adjust the aiming , and it 's getting better , but it goes to show that ccp is n't finished changing the fundamental parts of the game in order to improve it . 
  wikipedia is not infallible , especially when it strays from america centric topics . 
  queenslander here . 
  no , you fucking do not want to see that happen . 
  they patch it twice a week , with major updates once a month . 
  what more do you expect ? 
  as if you could tell a belgian from an austrian without hearing them speak . 
  when someone asks me where i 'm from , i say `` rockhampton , you fuck nut . '', 
  i do n't go around asking white people which european country they 're from ; unless someone has a strong foreign accent , do n't do the same to anyone else . 
  hundreds ? 
  of thousands , maybe . 
  australia exports camels to the middle east . 
  just saying . 
  i had camel in alice springs when i was last in town . 
  it 's pretty good ; a bit like veal . 
  the tactical variant has better sights but loses full auto . 
  12 seconds for control points . 
  he 'd need a lot of them ; those flyers would be pretty small . 
  your pride . 
  it worked so well for fatal ascension ... 
  i thing he 's hungarian , but it might be anywhere in eastern europe . 
  all i see is the goatse man . 
  the american office taught me all about [ sociopaths in the workplace ] ( http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/ ) , though . 
  i 've been on the receiving end of at least two matches like that . 
  the poor and uneducated have the worst teeth . 
  society pays for the dentistry . 
  it 's a shit load cheaper to add fluoride than train extra dentists . 
  australia does too have minimum wage laws . 
  the minimum wage is $ 16 . 
  also , it [ has n't hurt our economy ] ( http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;itemid=74&amp;jumival=10553 ) in ways we do n't like . 
  australia has $ 16 minimum wage , but mcdonald 's [ copes by hiring teenagers ] ( http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;itemid=74&amp;jumival=10553 ) . 
  we did that deliberately , so that young people get a good chance at employment while they 're living at home , but by the time they 're ready to head out on their own , their wages will be high enough to attempt it . 
  taxes * pay for * the ships lost in fleets . 
  i hear that was a problem for test at times . 
  bitchception, 
  i just find it ridiculous that you 're going to low sec instead of somewhere you can actually make money , like faction warfare or pirate npc space . 
  they can , however , look at what 's going on in other countries . 
  houses in australia are really expensive , but that 's due to investment tax laws more than anything else . 
  it will make things better , unless they raise it too high , which wo n't happen because of push back from business . 
  when i get drunk , i tell individual people they 're assholes if i think they really are . 
  it says something that gibson goes off on an entire race of people . 
  when australians murder people , we tend to use things that are easier to find than guns , like the local wildlife for instance . 
  aka `` the nsa '' . 
  amarr logistics : has a sidearm so you can use a light support weapon ( like a swarm launcher for light anti tank duties ), 
  minmatar logistics : moves fast , hacks fast , carries lots of equipment . 
  very good skirmish/deep strike support . 
  caldari logistics : high shields , moves fast , good for being the only logi on the team . 
  gallente logistics : lots of equipment , good for mutual support with a logi pair or being an equipment pack horse . 
  can be retooled to a biotic-enhanced sprinting machine for uplink duties .
