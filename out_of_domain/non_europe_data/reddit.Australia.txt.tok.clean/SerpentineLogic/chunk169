  yeah . 
  that 's a big bug . 
  join a corp with blueprint stockpiles . 
  a decent industry corp has 50 + billion isk in blueprints - good luck doing that yourself . 
  mittens already has his regards llc , just in case . 
  i look forward to the purging of babylon five dot dot . 
  i am an expert at catching core locus grenades . 
  with my face . 
  so say we all . 
  so post the cracked link instead of trying to hide behind wikipedia . 
  internet hard man detected . 
  then i 'd tell those feminists , how come it only applies to women ? 
  how sexist that the libs just assume that the woman will be the one taking time off work . 
  the eureka stockade southern cross is australia 's version of the confederate flag . 
  nice . 
  always good to see good teams go at it . 
  my blog has links in the sidebar for eve and dust sign ups . 
  my primary profession is karma escort . 
  full disclosure : i went to a children 's fair on the weekend and united way was there . 
  i signed some forms , and my kids will receive a free book per month , delivered , until they 're five . 
  so yeah , i 'm pretty amazed . 
  so did she , which is why she set it up . 
  her father was illiterate so there were no books in her house growing up .

  downgrade as necessary for your skills . 
  at least in ' 1984 ' , a chocolate ration * existed * . 
   pc is , and will still be , a joke until there are real consequences for not holding territory, 
  could you explain further ? 
  there 's heaps in darwin ( closest port ) , plus central queensland and all the other places where gold rushes occurred . 
  as far as interracial marriage goes , it did n't really happen much at first , although anecdotally the anglo-australians were okay with it before the chinese-australians were . 
  i 'd say that before about 1950 , most interracial marriages involved a chinese-australian and an indigenous australian , if it happened at all . 
  by the 1960s it was becoming more common , and it 's basically a free-for all these days . 
  most of the aussies of chinese descent are treated like whites by more recent chinese immigrants and consider them to have ` gone native ' , especially since their cantonese would be very bad by the third generation and would be virtually unintelligible by native speakers . 
   nprz : absolutely . 
  as far as subdreddit is concerned , we have gone from having maybe 10 players online during prime time , to having 30 or more . 
  cripes . 
  my * corp * has more players in prime time than that . 
  he especially scared the concentration camp survivors who were on set , watching filming . 
  substantially more than a normal pod ? 
  if i see any pod , it 's a target . 
  this may or may not have gotten me in trouble with blues before . 
  might be cheaper than additional airports in sydney , melbourne and brisbane . 
  this works well for me . 
  i hide behind a box and poof !, 
  disappear from scan . 
  not as much as the melee sprint exploit ... 
  also no aim assist on knives until 1.4, 
  i do n't carry an injector any more . 
  everyone tends to die from grenades or mass drivers :-(, 
  1 enh plate + 1 enh ferroscale = 127 armor for 47cpu +13 pg , with -4.35 % speed . 
  2 x basic plate = 130 armor for 20cpu +2 pg with -5.53 % speed . 
  personally , i 'd go with the basic plates and upgrade your shield extenders and other stuff instead . 
  uplinks are still useful though - you really do n't want to spend all that time getting into a good position every time you die,

   ** company description **, 
   ccp was founded in 1997 with the vision of harnessing the communication potential of the internet and the expressive artistic opportunities born out of ever more sophisticated technology to create new and unique form of collaborative entertainment in the form of virtual worlds . 
  the 2003 launch of eve online was the moment when everything involved in that vision clicked together and became a reality . 
   massively multiplayer games are virtual realities . 
  they are about creating experiences unattainable in any other form of media . 
  a virtual reality is about true human interaction and true human emotions in a living and evolving world . 
  it is ccp 's belief that massively multiplayer games are the biggest revolution in computer gaming history and ccp is dedicated to make the dream of a true virtual reality come into being . 
   ccp encourages respect , dialog , interaction and cooperation on a deeper level between its employees and customers than is common in online games . 
  by this and through this ccp provides a unique way for improving the quality of its products and creates an inspiring and challenging environment for talent to thrive . 
   ccp is comprised of intrepid pioneers willing to push their talents to the limits to create award winning virtual worlds and online games . 
  it is a team that possesses the drive and ability to break through the boundaries of conventional wisdom and hold fast in frontiers that others fear to tread . 
  as a result , we have built a team comprised of 20 nationalities , speaking 30 languages and from every walk of life all sharing the same trait , the capacity to successfully accomplish what many have told them was `` impossible '' to do . 
   those who welcome the tides of change , venture fearlessly into the unknown and bear the abilities necessary to overcome what others consider to be impossible should seek out ccp . 
  ours is the adventure you have been looking for . 
   if you are seeking a job and think you have what it takes apply at : http://ccp.is/jobs, 
  the cynic in me wonders if there was * suddenly * a position available after someone saw the minmatar heavy suit design ... 
  hmm , they seem to also have an [ opening for a game designer ] ( http://www.ccpgames.com/en/jobs/job-details.aspx?jobid=442 ) . 
  the main difference between the readers of the afr and readers of the oz is that when afr readers make decisions based on biased information , they lose money , status or their jobs , so they 're incentivised to keep the circlejerking to a minimum . 
  ironically , many countries outsource their it work there , so working for an american company is actually an option . 
  australia * the country * spends ~ 8 % of gdp on healthcare . 
  the op just mentioned that * he * pays a surcharge of 1.5 % of his taxable income in addition to whatever the government spends out of general revenue . 
  fairly certain that the gun range comment was a deliberate choice by that logistics director . 
  call it `` real life : causality '' if you will . 
  is the bald cat a euphemism or an actual cat ? 
  gives a new meaning to ` wedding tackle ' . 
  he was * very * popular until he got elected , then decided to do wildly unpopular things like [ cut 14000 jobs ] ( http://johnquiggin.com/2013/06/20/non-core-health-promises/ ) but give everyone in parliament 50 % pay rises , use peter costello 's economic report as a basis to cut funding to stuff he did n't like etc. 
  all things considered , i think a lot of queenslanders are coming to the realisation that when you elect a liberal partisan , * that 's what you get * . 
  next , on today tonight !, 
  fozzie said it * would * happen , but not in time for the 1.1 releas .
