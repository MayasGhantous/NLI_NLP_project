  * tactical weapon reconfiguration v for tech 2 siege module . 
  moroses are a lot better than they were a year ago . 
  * tactical logistics reconfiguration i-v because sometimes you need to triage stuff, 
  * capital shield emission systems , because sometimes you need to rep shields . 
  now , officer rats are a legitimate target for a hot drop . 
  and theyd be wrong . 
  each loss is 3 days tops , but an extra level in a subsystem skill is easily worth tens or hundreds of millions to achieve another way , like +5 % hardwires or faction modules . 
  each t3 has at least three subsystems that it 's stupid and wasteful to leave at iv . 
   oracle ca n't fit anything close to a decent shield tank, 
  that 's probably why many of the oracles i see are untanked sniper fit . 
  ** beginner : **, 
  use an exploration frigate to scan , fit with :, 
  * core probe launcher, 
  * 2 x small gravity capacitor upgrade i rigs, 
  then swap to another ship to run the site , preferably ones with spare mid slots . 
  ** intermediate : **, 
  fly an all-in-one ship that can scan and do small sites . 
  many people fly drone ships like the arbitrator , vexor or myrmidon , because they can use high slots for probe launchers and salvagers , and mid slots fo codebreakers and analysers without too much lost of dps or tank . 
  ** experienced : **, 
  scanning harder sites often requires scan bonuses you ca n't get with a t1 all-in-one setup . 
  if you encounter a site like this , you 'll need a covert ops frigate , ideally fitted with :, 
  * covert ops cloaking device ( once probes are out , you can scan while cloaked ), 
  * core probe launcher ii ( or sisters core probe launcher ), 
  * 2 x small gravity capacitor upgrade i rigs, 
  then swap to another ship to run the ( harder ) site . 
  ** elite : **, 
  run an all-in-one exploration-focused strategic cruiser . 
  fly anywhere you want , do any site . 
  an example fit would be an [ exploration tengu ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) . 
  an extra rig slot means , what , 30 % more shield regen ? 
  lucky shield regen is not stacking penalised . 
  conveniently , the rig drawback , sig radius , * is * . 
   fruit picking in the sun sounds like heaven believe it or not . 
  in winter , yeah . 
  in summer , not so yeah . 
  you 're probably just unlucky . 
  i used to do exploration in the teshkat pocket when i were a young lad , and only got killed about once a month . 
  now , imagine if you were a member of a corporation that controlled the lowsec area you were exploring in . 
  want to know if it 's safe to jump ? 
  get someone to scout it in a cloaked ship for you . 
  get jumped in your battlecruiser while running a site ? 
  get backup in a few seconds as everyone in-system fleetwarps to your position . 
  eve is an mmo . 
  do not be surprised when things are easier with friends . 
  then troll them in local until they eject when they meant to self-destruct . 
   ( usually the girls get the job with the stop/go sign for some reason ) . 
  because motorists actually look at them . 
  yes . 
  in fact , without agent quality being a factor , it 's the only thing left . 
  i once narrowly escaped being suicide ganked by a seven-year old . 
   `` that internet spaceship penis game '' . 
  so true . 
  aero -  fisher price, 
  this will end well . 
  try this [ summary ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?231-coming-back-to-eve-don-t-make-a-new-one-use-this-thread&amp;p=354656&amp;viewfull=1#post354656 ), 
  offensive and defensive subsystems skills should go to v , for obvious reasons . 
  not terrible , but not stellar either , assuming it 's as accurate as [ the author ] ( http://mmodata.blogspot.com/2012/02/mmodata-charts-version-36-is-live.html ) asserts . 
  syncaine was apparently [ kinda a big deal ] ( http://syncaine.com/2012/01/16/im-kind-of-a-big-deal/ ) on darkfall and now has an eve corporation . 
  he has a lot to say about eve , but it basically boils down to it being a spiritual successor to darkfall . 
  at least it 's guaranteed to be circular ( within tolerances ), 
  because they did n't bribe someone enough . 
  if only there were [ other countries ] ( / r/australia ) that offered generous incentives for engineering graduates , while having millions of greek ex-pats . 
  australia also benefits from the brain drain from nz , so while it 's advantageous for both countries to forge closer economic and regulatory ties , it 's not good to completely merge them . 
   also , any one got a graph for startrek online ? 
  sto is in the [ 50k-150k subs ] ( http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/charts/subs-3.png ) chart . 
  however , the blog notes :, 
   i am trying to get some numbers for star trek , now that they went f2p . 
  they got a serious boost in active accounts , no doubt about it . 
  i may be able to make an estime ( sic ) for v3 .7, 
  it 's probably down from expecations due to the [ swtor effect ] ( http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/charts/subs-1.png ) . 
  perhaps the numbers will trend better once people run through the tor single-player campaign a few times then realise it 's a terrible mmo . 
  then you really need to work on your fitting skills . 
  * weapon upgrades, 
  * electronics, 
  frankly , i would n't bother with an armor repairer ( or repair rigs ) on most t1 frigates . 
  if you fly gallente frigates , you are guaranteed that 30 seconds after you engage , * someone * is going home in a pod . 
  try with an afterburner for the time being , then . 
  i guess jovian prop mods burn green vov, 
  supercapital ships : how have they shaped fleet composition and doctrines , and what would you do to `` fix '' them ? 
   [ ... ] then it 's time to find a new system to mine in . 
  ... or a catalyst and a handful of caldari navy antimatter shells . 
  plus you can follow people around * by magic !, 
  * if they give you their radar #id, 
  there 's been an idea floated around for a capital ( infini ) point for super-on-super * action * . 
  are you for or against this , and if so , do you think it should be able to be fit on normal caps , or just supers ? 
  it 's never lupos . 
  if you really must do mining , [ mine hemorphite ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/abcs.html ) . 
  incursus does n't have enough cap for it . 
  petition . 
  maybe they 'll cut you a deal . 
   i thought they hit gallente lowsec too ? 
  who mines ice in lowsec , really ? 
  for those at work :, 
   i 'm doing some proof-of-concept work right now which involves exploring possible changes we could make to the combat data we deliver via the api . 
   ** what sorts of data could we provide to make killboards better ? 
  ** i 'm not really worrying about technical constraints at this stage , i 'm just trying to build a list of interesting data we could be providing , so let your imaginations run a little bit wild !, 
   thanks ,, 
   - greyscale, 
  personally , i would like clone grade to be on pod killmails , so i know exactly how much i cost someone with my thrasher . 
   he 's probably autofellating .
