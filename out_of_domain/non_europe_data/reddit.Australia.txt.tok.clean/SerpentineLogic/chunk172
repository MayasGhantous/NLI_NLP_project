  it 's always rough until the matchmaking gets enough data on you . 
  that 's why you * fight * them . 
  besides , they ca n't be as scary as aussie wildlife . 
  sadly , both of those parties are based out of the same office , and bot preference the liberals . 
  i suspect they are political shill parties . 
  bowl and hyperbole do n't rhyme , fyi . 
  well it is election day . 
  they 're probably in the voting booths . 
  i 'd provide a link , but it might be personalised , which would make things awkward . 
  reps : repairs . 
  usually into the context of remote reps from a repair tool . 
  i do n't think abbott approves of man dates . 
  but seriously , just point them to the dust wiki . 
  yeah , would like to see the difference . 
  that 's part of the problem . 
  the shanghai office seems to have a very different company culture that needs to be upgraded . 
  they 're probably still collecting data on the aim assist . 
  i do n't even, 
  that 's what ccp is hoping , too . 
  i 'm having quite a few problems with mousing . 
  my muscle memory had to cope with uprising 1 , 1.1 and now 1.4 . 
  it 's pretty damn hard to hit someone this patch , especially if you scope up . 
  yeah , probably a saving face issue . 
  surely there 's a middle ground where ads sensitivity is lower than unscoped , so i can actually hit someone . 
  that would be awesome . 
  at the moment , i 'm using my strafe keys to aim at long range because mouse is just too sensitive . 
  might want to wait for 1.5 when more more changes are due . 
  because the idea that you can have your cake and eat it too is very seductive , especially if you 're in politics and can use the idea to do whatever you want . 
  and the last six were way worse than the first ones . 
  or screen cap the page . 
  unless you get tagged driving to your mate 's place . 
  some states in the us have cop cars with cameras that look up every license plate they drive past and check against outstanding warrants etc. 
  like / u/flashman said , whether it 's good or bad is one thing , but it 's clear that it 's really *** useful *** if you happen to be a cop . 
  get back to me with this argument when cops have go-pro cameras on duty so we can see what they 're doing . 
  all the sov alliances have huge renter programs . 
  the name of the alliance is designed for marketing purposes rather than social cohesion . 
  well , you can [ go here ] ( http://eve-files.com/media/corp/veritechina/ ) and look at the timestamps . 
  looks like it 's updated weekly . 
  rl politics vov, 
  just for china , because of their firewall . 
  do you * also * have an implant for structure hit points ? 
  +5 % armor is 1000 armor points . 
  +5 % structure is 5312 hull points . 
  make the time grind more palatable . 
  there 's many ways to do it ; one of the popular ones is to have unused active sp roll over between weeks . 
  do fps better . 
  there 's a lot of work to do here . 
  have eve lore affect the players more , and vice versa . 
  normal hp , assuming zero skills . 
  it is . 
   the report concludes that the experiment has been a success overall , with the negatives being outweighed by the positives . 
  it does not make any recommendation for either expanding or contracting the offer in the future , but rather recommends the republic maintain the status quo to continue examining long term trends . 
   labor 's version of the nbn was n't at all perfect . 
  what would improve it ? 
  that 's why i try not to go to / r/brisbane . 
  not in queensland . 
  then again , i only found that out today . 
  100 % not cool . 
  the big red donut , so to speak . 
   can we please make the the phrase `` gillards someone '' a common thing, 
  [ gillardthing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/the_halifax_gibbet_-_geograph.org.uk_-_350422.jpg ), 
  urine theft is a serious offence . 
  jokes on you . 
  i 'm not a real cop !, 
   due to our adjustments , the bonus sp for the event will be delivered after the event rather than live , as with other events . 
  probably tomorrow or thursday . 
  perhaps create a sister alliance `` state-provided tibet , maximum one per couple '' . 
  [ much crying old experts ] ( http://killboard.nl/en/?a=corp_detail&amp;crp_id=3 ) . 
  they often do , yes . 
  i believe an earlier news report quoted kain spero . 
  generally the game-changing events are scripted , but they 're fine with other events making changes to the game world , e.g. 
  minor characters being assassinated by players en route to an event etc. 
  sup / u/jenitive _ case . 
  yeah , but you login . 
  that 's cheating . 
  should be back now . 
  the outage lasted less than a day . 
  warbarge strikes will be removed from all lowsec battles soon . 
  oh , you can get into ceve if you 're willing to jump through some hoops . 
  the failheap guys have a small contingent that have something like 93 % efficiency while soloing in taloses . 
  they 'll be first against the wall come the revolution . 
  not gon na lie , the australian version looks way better . 
  i think you know why . 
  settle , petal . 
  so , what 's the plural of minx ? 
  i 've switched to the assault scrambler because aiming is p hard now . 
  i have no idea whether i even got my sp bonus , since i only pay attention to it when i feel like spending it , which is only a few times a month . 
  you 'd be surprised how little they would cost . 
  60m on an assault rifle is ridiculous tho . 
  what 's missing from the eve-dust connection is [ agency ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agency_%28philosophy%29 ) . 
  there is no way to act independently to affect the other game . 
  he 's still fairly centrist compared to the other independents . 
  at present , aim-assist gets more pronounced at longer ranges , coupled with, 
  60m is an ar 's * effective * range - i think it should only assist out to optimal . 
  the csm are [ also concerned ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/csm8-status-report-week-eighteen.html ) :, 
   the main meeting this past week was about the dust-eve link . 
  as i said in my daily status , both the csm and cpm are a tiny bit concerned with where the link is going and want to express our concerns as a group in detail . 
  it 's not that the plans for the link are bad . 
  it 's just that many members of the csm and cpm are concerned that they 're not bold enough . 
  go to failheap and sign up in the ceve thread , then .
