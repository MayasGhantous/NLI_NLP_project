  i still prefer the failheap one . 
  without ccp zulu , they have to make inflammatory comments manually . 
  ca n't blame aim assist at that range . 
  be sure to read the eulogy linked in the article . 
   is this because its a planetary conquest match ? 
  yes , the base payout for a pc match is a million isk , plus extra for each clone killed . 
  i got my mail too . 
  personally , i 'm not averse to microtransactions in principle , but a f2p eve would be abhorrent . 
  starter lavs run out now . 
  there 's still a few lav blueprints around the place though . 
  please do n't turn it into a competition . 
  he was the guy that family first was targeting with the sad baby billboard . 
  surely they would outsource that ? 
  having it in high sec is pretty convenient . 
  the charters cost like 1 % of the fuel cost , so the only problems are getting standings and finding the right moon . 
  expensive ? 
  the improved hit detection means you 'll be spending twice as much on suits than on vehicles . 
  then perhaps it 's time to win at eve for a while . 
  there 's no shame in it ; i have a year 's worth of plex in jita for when i inevitably quit and resub,

   i really want to know what her political positions are now that she 's not shackled by her backers, 
  i suspect they are considerably more left-leaning than she projected while pm . 
  one can make the argument that it 's an acceptable cost , especially weighed up against the increased gains to the country via improved literacy and education via gonski , not to mention whatever savings there are to be made by paying private schools less per student to funnel the money into the public schools that need it the most .

   a few months ago i bought a visa prepaid card and i could n't use it for eve because the billing for eve goes out of country , and the visa prepaid card only did us transactions . 
  so why do n't you use it at an online [ game time reseller ] ( https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx ) in the us ? 
  some of them have been waiting since the howard years for the liberals to do something decent . 
  hopefully someone will leak * that * too .

  hmm , wonder if good skills and ak0 assault suit mean a laser rifle runs out of ammunition before it overheats ... 
  as an australian , that dsl deal sounds fan * tastic * .

  i read a statistic that ~ 30 % of us bankruptcies are due to medical bills .

  to be fair , romneycare is still far from a working system . 
  it just happens to be better that other parts of the country . 
  cantonese has way more than four tones , but it 's not because they 're missing sounds ; they use different sounds that do n't get used in mandarin .
