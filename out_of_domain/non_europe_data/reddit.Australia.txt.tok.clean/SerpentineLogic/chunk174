  i also have my own blog , but it 's mostly where i repost top-quality stuff i find on the net , so i do n't know if it really counts . 
  keeping up with her blog posts is a full time job : /, 
  soon ^ tm, 
  i do n't feel bad . 
  they made their bed ; now they must lie in it . 
   saved themselves the trouble of lashings , scurvy and sodomy on the high seas, 
  you take all the fun out of life . 
  books given ; goat received . 
  thanks , everyone !, 
  was it [ this guy ] ( http://eveblog.allumis.co.uk ) ? 
  i think i 've been poe 's lawed . 
  i did n't get those skills to v until i was at 10m skill points or so . 
  i 'm following this series vov, 
  more details here :, 
  meh , a bit false equivalency there . 
  even then , i only bit the bullet when i had problems fitting stuff to my advanced suit, 
  sup / u/snapshot _ bot , try http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/2013/09/19/media-release-applause-for-act-marriage-equality-bill-call-on-federal-government-opposition-to-let-a-c-t-law-stand/, 
  edit : will it work if i edit ? 
  / u/snapshot _ bot , listen carefully . 
  i want you to take a snapshot of http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/2013/09/19/media-release-applause-for-act-marriage-equality-bill-call-on-federal-government-opposition-to-let-a-c-t-law-stand/ and i wo n't ask you again . 
  / r/australia please . 
  neat , edits do work . 
  what 's more important ? 
  companies that manufacture cars , or the ultra-critical [ salary packaging industry ] ( http://johnquiggin.com/2013/09/19/saving-the-salary-packaging-industry/ ) ? 
  ... and let 's face it , it 's heaps of fun to go into a match knowing there 's five other players backing you up ( or for you to back them up with ammo or revives or whatever ), 
  you may find this useful :,

  dropping a hundred bucks on a game that you may or may not like seems excessive . 
  the $ 20 merc pack is a much more prudent purchase . 
   1st - calling for the complete removal of a game mechanic because a group found an exploit is total and complete pants on head retarded . 
  bold words from marlona `` remove local '' sky . 
  what time zone do you play ? 
  never been in there ; looked dodgy as fuck ,, 
  hey / u/snapshot _ bot , cache [ this ] ( http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/melbourne-demons-help-dad-give-sixyearold-boy-the-greatest-birthday-gift/story-fndv7pj3-1226723009652 ) so i do n't have to go to news.com.au . 
  ability to easily cache the op of a link submission post . 
  my current headphones are a px 21 and have lasted a bare three months . 
  my next set will be an astro a 40 . 
  it amuses me that the audio purchase far exceeds the ps3 itself , but there you go ;-), 
  some time soon , bombardment beacons will turn up in factional warfare systems . 
  that will be pretty neat . 
  could be a real hearing . 
  could be a witch hunt hearing . 
  hard to keep up at times . 
   a report produced by the australian institute of criminology in may 1990 recommended that prostitution not be a criminal offence , since the current laws were ineffective and endangered sex workers . 
  [ \\ [ 4 \\ ] ] ( http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi22.html ), 
  op will surely deliver , 
  australia does the same thing .

  people are surprised how tough industrial machinery is , i guess . 
  forums imply it 's everyone . 
  it was dolan was n't it . 
  you mean , hockey walked into a door . 
  only modules + ( some ) rigs are stacking penalised . 
  bonuses are multiplicative , except for margin trading which is iteratively multiplicative with itself for some reason . 
  you sure ? 
   and zed, 
  now i know my abc 's, 
  so they 're stuck inside my head . 
  go home far eastern states , you 're drunk . 
  ask us in two months . 
  unlike other games that are released then almost abandoned , dust started bare bones and improves each month . 
  the pub match timer for the mcc has been reduced to practically zero , so you 'll often just get dropped straight into the game if your ps3 is n't ultra-fast . 
  the reason it 's $ 6 in europe is that there 's a lot of forged carbon credits floating around in the market . 
  you might not have noticed , but many countries in the eu have a credibility problem ... 
  it 's a pub match . 
  it 's not all-important to have a few minutes at the start of the match to organise players into squads , work out who has vehicle skills so there 's enough hav and transport coverage , then decide on a rough strategy for the game type . 
  it 's much better to deploy immediately and get the fun started . 
  if someone wants to join an existing squad , they can do it while they 're waiting to respawn or something . 
  where did you get the idea for the lyrics behind * underwater love * ? 
  there 's an interpol report on it . 
  i always try to keep a 7 day active booster in stock , so i can really go to town during double sp weeks . 
  he 's quitting when he runs out of plex . 
  aka ` what any bitter vet does ', 
  if you 're willing to run double t2 acr rigs , then you can roll with t2 reps on your guardian . 
  i 'm all for socks iv . 
  but , that 's the way economies * work * . 
  if you choose your items well , you only need to log in three times a month ;-), 
   surely this ca n't be true ? 
  you must be new to politics . 
  that , with a sprinkle of t2 bpos . 
  it 's pretty neat , actually . 
  space communism : way better than rl communism . 
  not really . 
  a few hundred million a month for any affordable bpo . 
  whatever you want . 
  there 's a [ lot to do ] ( http://www.swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ ) . 
  for [ mining ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ) , i like the procurer because it 's cheap and so durable that it 's not worth attacking , or the retriever because the ore hold is huge . 
  i have n't been tempted to train for the tech 2 mining ships because mining is just a sideline for me . 
  occasionally i undock in an [ ice mining fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/new-mining-barges-ice-harvesting/ ) to mine ice and troll gankers . 
  strip miners are great , as are survey scanners . 
  make sure to fit mining crystals if you use tech 2 strips . 
  mining drones are a bit meh . 
  other players like to pop retrievers so take care out there , 
  you 'll probably need four drones to fend off npc pirates , especially in systems below 0.8 security status . 
  try not to go below 0.5 sec systems unless you have a corp backing you up . 
  has n't happened to me for a while , but usually sprinting , melee or crouching fixes it . 
  what effort ? 
  buy orders happen when you 're not logged in . 
  damage control ii .
