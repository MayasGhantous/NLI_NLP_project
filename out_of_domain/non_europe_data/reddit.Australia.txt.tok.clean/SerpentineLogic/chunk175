  if you 're paying fuel costs to get access to lab slots , it wo n't be a billion profit . 
  we also pay for it with reduced bulk-buying-of-medicine costs and increased productivity from not-being-sick . 
  * standard active scanner : 46 db, 
  * advanced active scanner : 36 db, 
  * prototype active scanner : 28 db, 
  base profile of a light frame is 45db , so you 'll never be caught by an active scanner . 
  add a basic damp and you 're down to 38.25 db ; still not enough to save you from advanced scans , but if you train profile dampening skill to iii you 'll just scrape in under the scan . 
  to get under 28db , you 'll probably need multiple damps . 
  2 basic damps wo n't get you down far enough unless you 're running a scout suit ( in which case you can run an scout suit at skill level iii and be at 27db or lower ) . 
  however , if all you have is a light frame suit , two enhanced damps is just enough to get you there ( 27.95 db ) . 
  so , you wo n't show up on active scanning ( or the equivalent passive scans all suits have ) but you still have to worry about being spotted visually . 
  yes , but your argument is still weak . 
  you 'd die to a scrambler rifle just as easily .

  the cuts were [ not needed ] ( http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/08/01/quiggin-qld-isnt-greece-or-spain-acting-like-it-could-hurt/ ) , and part of his ` solution ' was to sell off a bunch of brisbane office buildings , which injects some quick cash into the books but creates a [ structural deficit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_and_cyclical_deficit ) in the form of office rent . 
  medium frames ( and assault frames ) have 50db profile but 55db precision , so while you ca n't naturally pick up other medium frames , your scan profile is n't much larger than a light frame . 
  so with profile dampening v , your profile is 45 , so a complex module gets you down to 33.75 db and protection from advanced scanners . 
  why not both ?

  yes . 
  the drop suit skills are quite narrow in focus , just like the equipment and weapon skills . 
  points you put into narrow skills are only applicable when you 're using the item in question . 
  having said that , getting a medium frame to skill level three is a good trade off between use of skill points and the number of suits available to train into .
