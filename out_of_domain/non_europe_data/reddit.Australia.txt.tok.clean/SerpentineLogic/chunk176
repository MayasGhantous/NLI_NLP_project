  protip : iodised salt is a good thing to have in your home . 
  we do n't have that in australia ; we do have large-grain sea salt which can be ground like pepper . 
  even so , you can still buy [ iodised sea salt refills ] ( http://www.mckenziesfoods.com.au/product/212/mckenzies_iodised_sea_salt ) . 
  also , advanced suits are generally the most you 'd expect to use in an instant battle , so it 's of little use spending all those skill points on suit skills when there 's so many other places to put them . 
  generally you should be looking at prototype suits at about 10m skill points , but only if you have a good squad at your back to inject you when you drop . 
  running prototype suits and/or weapons is a very expensive proposition otherwise . 
  they have n't even said whether it 's set in * contemporary * new eden . 
  for all we know , it could be set anywhere in eve online 's history . 
  click some cookies instead . 
  i have heard it said that , in the us , freedom means `` freedom to do x '' , whereas in the rest of the world , freedom means `` freedom *** from *** x '' . 
  there 's many consequences to that divide ; perhaps this is one of them . 
  also , as the economies are integrated , you 'll see aurum being sent from eve to dust , which also ultimately gives ccp revenue . 
  vehicle modules are n't so cheap . 
  just saying . 
  easily the best and most-enduring contribution he has made to eve . 
  hugo weaving really gets around . 
  like the federal government , i 'm down with that . 
  factional warfare is a bit more hard core than pub matches . 
  will post more helpful stuff when i find a keyboard ;-), 
  as an australian , i 'd be happy to pay less than $ 30 for a merc pack . 
  personally , i suggest buying a mercenary pack from the online store . 
  it comes with useful blueprints and is very good value . 
  by and large , many of the available blueprints are n't worth spending money on . 
  the veteran and elite packs will stay around for a while ; the merc pack is disappearing in a week . 
  the amarr destroyer used that model during inferno , according to the chaos data dumps . 
  yeah , must be their go-to place holder model . 
  racial packs ? 
  who knows . 
  search for mike devoid pi spreadsheet . 
  the merc pack is very good value for money . 
  * $ 20 of aurum, 
  * 30-day active booster worth $ 14, 
  * blueprints which are nice to have, 
  * 50x various chaff modules , but hey , free . 
  all for $ 20 . 
  wait , hans is alive ? 
  he promised to write a blog post on aim assist , and that was before the devpost extravagana of the last week or so . 
  my comments [ are here ] ( http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/10/01/dust-514-a-new-player-experience-introduced-with-uprising-1-5/#comment-427873 ) . 
  i 'm internet-famous !, 
  elite pack is :, 
  * $ 100 of aurum, 
  * boosters worth $ 56, 
  * various blueprints ranging from meh to awesome, 
  * various items totalling a non-trivial 8 million isk, 
  for $ 100 . 
  disregarding the blueprints ( i suggest that the elite pack 's blueprints are five times as good as the mercenary pack ) , you have :, 
  merc pack : $ 1.70 worth of goods for each dollar spent, 
  elite pack : $ 1.56 worth of goods for each dollar spent,

  you 'll need a usb splitter to put mouse + keyboard + headphones . 
  try to get a powered usb hub , though - my ps3 was flaky with all three connected and drawing power from the console instead of being helped out by the hub . 
  vehicle modules . 
  in australia , each party gets $ 2.48 from the treasury for each vote they get , but political donations are capped much more stringently . 
  admittedly , my karma *** is *** over 9000 ... 
  well , she certainly eliminated all the juice . 
  but rich . 
  not compared to the normal boosters , but yes compared to the booster bundles you can buy . 
  the same could be said for coal or iron ore . 
  the idea is to skim the extra profits and make the country wealthy ( not necessarily the same as individual residents ), 
  i believe norway plans to spend all its stockpiles of cash in the next century . 
  such is life . 
  your / s is showing . 
  the effect of the best workers leaving a company first is called the [ dead sea effect ] ( http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/ ) . 
  from what i 've read , the budget has brought forward the 12,000 job losses so it assumes they all appear immediately , instead of in dribs and drabs over the next 12-36 months . 
  that 's going to come back to bite them . 
  crap , they 're all gone :(, 
  they can satisfy themselves with insulting them in subtle ways , just like this . 
  faster cool down , longer duration . 
  i get overtime or toil because i ask for it . 
  if they say no , i remember , and factor it in when contract negotiations next occur . 
  i 'm all for workplace flexibility , but if it 's a one-way thing and i 'm working 60-hour weeks for no extra pay , then , as a professional , i have the occupational mobility to say ` fuck you pay me ' or find a different employer . 
  yes . 
  it 's pretty nice . 
  i find it interesting that time-based pay is common at the lower end and the upper end of employment ( i.e. 
  lawyers billing in 6-minute increments ) but the middle class gets saddled with the salaried rate . 
  i guess it 's [ true what they say .

  could be worse ; could have been dysart . 
  also , the more times you change jobs , the less worried you are that you ca n't hack it in the next one . 
  future fund is a sovereign wealth fund . 
  one of the howard decisions i was all for . 
  still no [ agency ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/the-eve-dust-link-a-question-of-agency/ ) allowed from the dust end , though . 
  well , how else are we going to get more ammo and our armor repped ? 
  we keep needling you because we love you . 
  also because we like needling people , and you 're handy . 
  you should set up a bot for all news/event/devblog posts , so you can concentrate on just the devposts ... 
  you forgot to reticulate splines . 
  there 's a few stylistic changes i 'd make ( using hamcrest matchers in unit tests , extracting complicated if statements into meaningful methods , not leveraging apache commons for all that string null-checking , not using the enum pattern for singletons etc ) but i 'm basically just bikeshedding . 
  nice job . 
  fair enough . 
  just seems odd that you 're using maven but not using the bits ( dependency management ) that make maven bearable . 
  it depends . 
  you need to think hard about what kind of vehicle you are okay with being cheap and disposable . 
  personally , that means you 're looking for situations where you are totally okay with ejecting from , then doing that walk-away-dont-look-at-explosion thing . 
  * travel-fit lavs, 
  * disposable dropships, 
  i 'm guessing you do n't have children . 
  i could arrange a couch for you guys to holiday in npc null sec . 
  the problem with militia equipment blueprints is that the isk version is so cheap that it 's not really worth the expense vs a booster or whatever . 
  spectacular .
