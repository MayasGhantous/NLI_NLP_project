  i can arrange for [ blues ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net ) . 
  eve at least got the code for ship fitting calculations ( called dogma ) . 
  dust has a similar thing called catma but they have n't released the code . 
  npc nullsec , so no . 
  they were on 160k before the boom , according to the people i know at bhp . 
  you know there 's a bundle in the storethat has a 30 day active and passive for 46k ~ ~ isk ~ ~ aur right ? 
  that 's the same discount . 
  should be anyone under 25k war points imo . 
  er , aur . 
  they still come free in certain packs . 
  just not via the store . 
  [ commons-lang ] ( http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3 ) is ~ 300kb . 
  considered precomputing that ? 
  i mean , how often does new eden change ? 
  heck , make it a maven artifact and include it as a dependency , 
  it 's a good taste of the different types of suit and vehicle , without the hassle of needing the fitting screen . 
  tldr ; it 's * not designed * for you ; the veteran pack is . 
  too good . 
  it would n't have been so bad if it had still existed but as a once-per-account deal , but even then , the blueprints it provided would have distorted the market . 
  i think they 're trying to wean people off the ` buy pack get stuff plus aurum ' idea and onto ` buy aurum , spend on what you want ', 
  he 's had a fair shake of the sauce bottle already . 
  i believe it 's some kind of public school hazing ritual . 
  baked goods too . 
  taught by the french , then enhanced by locals . 
  you should see me in / r/evevalkyrie, 
  it has a * hammer * on its * head * . 
  i 'm sold . 
  i die a lot . 
  i 'm lucky to break even . 
  stillhave 170 mill left . 
  transport bonuses for lavs would be ridiculous . 
  the game would be full of triple heavy packs acting like terminator suicide squads . 
  the price is too damn high . 
  yeah totally . 
  all aurum stuff was stupid cheap in closed beta . 
  the new zealand government did a cost benefit for their version - turns out it would be profitable enough to pay for australia 's nbn , let alone the kiwi version . 
  i think the europeans would love to have our problems . 
  from what i have read , the roma are basically nomadic organised crime syndicates . 
  well , we certainly ca n't ask * her * , can we ? 
  the newman government moved labour day to today . 
  the fuck . 
  i 'm 90 % certain they did it just to [ fuck with ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-31/labour-day-holiday-move-attacks-qld-workers/4343426 ) the labor party , since it originated in queensland . 
  i tend to hand out +3 implants like candy to my recruits . 
  no , they moved the queen 's birthday holiday to october ; queensland labour day has been celebrated on may 1 * since 1891 * . 
  \\* cough \\* the matrix \\* cough \\*, 
  a candy store , obviously . 
  you know you can query multiple items with one call , right ? 
  took [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/7qmbyvil.jpg ) a couple days ago . 
  i have some in my badger . 
  hop in ; it 's totally legit . 
  buy +3 implants for intelligence and perception . 
  you 'll use the rest on skill books , probably . 
  i tend to funnel my out of corp donations through the angel project . 
  `` oh , swelling of your penis you say . 
  wasps , was it ? 
  let me call in dr mike to do the inspection for me . 
  also this is the fourth time this week and i 'm getting annoyed at your implausible stories . '', 
  no , to pick over the corpses of political careers . 
  not if you get it from other places e.g australia . 
  do you not remember the public holiday this time last year ? 
  factional warfare ? 
  june was the one-off . 
  the october holiday was meant to be permanent . 
  well then . 
  that 's how they get you . 
  how 's business ? 
  send photo . 
  there 's scientists working on a vaccine for that . 
  different scientists to the ones in the op , of course . 
  turns out i 'm on 35 days unbroken record . 
   i 'm more of a critic . 
  well , you 'll fit * right in * here , then . 
  build costs of the new deployables ? 
  this is the usual answer to a newspaper article title that asks a yes no question . 
  you can even read my emai - oh wait , you already do . 
  carry on . 
  google maps was written in sydney . 
  the more you know ^ tm, 
  and ban all pseudonyms in plus !, 
  ^ ( yes , still bitter . ), 
  a few guys organising scl got iwscorps recently as a thank-you gift , confirmed by bacch . 
  i 'm considerably less butthurt about that than the somer thing . 
  does the `` reply to topic '' link not work for you ? 
  evesearch and dustsearch have been better than the official forums since 2005 vov, 
  you are my second-favorite type of bacon . 
  in that case , let me mention how awesome an idea it is and i look forward to the next cpm update and will forgive you for any smugness you may inject into it . 
  yes . 
   national fiber optics network , like they did the highways way back when . 
  that would create a lot of jobs and kill fewer people . 
  we 're trying to do that in australia , and we ca n't even get that over the line , with a change of government doing its best to gut the project . 
  because nobody has said ` no ' yet . 
  yes , it is pronounced booz 'm . 
  well , it certainly reduced the amount of lfs spam . 
  plus , i can name the squads suggestive names . 
  if we could join squads that were already deployed , we 'd eliminate the reverse ; the ` rf2 ' announcements . 
  yes , except only two big players . 
  the main issue is ideology . 
  the new government is against public utilities , which the new network will be at least for wholesale . 
  their alternative is 10 % cheaper but only 4 % as good , which is quite poor value for money . 
  not a huge fan of what bfh became ...
