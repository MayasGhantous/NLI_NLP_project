  ( edit : minimum purchase was 200l i.e. 
  a drum of petrol ), 
  went down that highway a decade back . 
  broke a shock absorber mount , muffler damn near fell off too . 
  was very lucky that a travelling companion had a portable welder . 
  happens naturally . 
  might have been $ 1.60 . 
  it was * a long * time ago . 
  edit : nope , $ 1.30 , because i remember it was $ 260 for the 44 gallon drum . 
  personal wallet divisions have been a request for years . 
  worth it . 
  and according to germaine greer , the rest of it is devoid of culture . 
  carrying an [ epirb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distress_radiobeacon ) is not a bad idea either . 
  i think so ; not sure what a lot of places were called : /, 
  there 's maybe three cars a week that go down that highway . 
  it 's probably only graded a few times a decade . 
  well 33 . 
  never again . 
  he 's a welder by trade . 
  he even welded his camping trailer . 
  fucking thing weighed over a tonne . 
  i once spent an entire match dropping cars on blue snipers . 
  seriously , fourteen snipers in a domination match is ridiculous . 
   so it remains unclear as to why the network appears to have lost faith in the drama , although one possibility is that puberty blues is perceived to be linked with failed former ten ceo david warburton . 
  office politics at work . 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but / r/brisbane is terrible . 
  you should organise a demo at the mana bar . 
  shit , you could charge money , 
  tried flight centre , or whoever they outsource shop fit-outs to ? 
  / u/mrgimbleb is too modest to post this , but i 'm not . 
  i strongly suspect nobody has done this . 
  it was one of ten 's more popular shows vov, 
  try [ via amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.com/days-game-time-exclusive-ship/dp/b00a2ci55s/ ) ? 
  green left weakly . 
  has a nice ring to it . 
  to be fair , chribba is much more of a bastard in dust than he is in eve . 
  so , charge * them * money , 
   on reflection it seems clear that obama is doing this to ensure that the republican congress is unpopular, 
  he 's doing it because if he gives in now , the republicans will use this tactic for everything from now on . 
  literally nothing would get done without the gop 's approval . 
  that 's the same level of hostility that caused their last civil war . 
  in eve , you empty asteroid belts instead . 
  come for the spaceships ; stay for the stories . 
  the house * is n't floating * a clean bill , so it 's out of his hands anyway . 
  [ character generation explained ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/index.php?title=the_newberry%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy#character_creation_.28why_is_it_so_hard_to_choose.29 ), 
  i can wait . 
  multiple players in the same ship . 
  i keep a mine in every ship , just for hilarious lossmails . 
  high energy physics , for marauders . 
  also an anagram of rise . 
  i think we all know who 's playing favourites with this rebalance ... 
  oh , like you do n't have all racial destroyers at v already . 
  more * women * . 
   the most important thing that other developed countries like australia and canada have which is missing in the us is a nonpartisan electoral commission in charge of drawing/redrawing districts , and making sure that voting is easy , available , and fair . 
  that would go a huge way towards helping things in the us , even without mandatory voting . 
  quite . 
  the level of electoral corruption and mismanagement in the us is unheard of in a developed country . 
  i 'm sure everyone is trying to get confirmation that it 's really her . 
   put sauce on your pies , or you will look weird, 
  i believe you misspelt ` peas ', 
  next you 'll be telling me that two-hour-long rambling conversations with the only video being people 's faces do n't belong on youtube . 
  they 've been half-arsing a fiscal stimulus for ~ 9 years , and now they do n't have enough in the tank for a proper go at it . 
  i think they probably need a hawke-keating kick-in-the-pants level of structural reform to get them out of their current stagnation . 
  get out . 
   but that 's like getting beaten up at high school by someone close to your age and then you gone down to primary school and bash up some poor year 2 kids just so you can get some pride back, 
  that 's exactly how eve online works ; what 's the problem ? 
  sadly , corp shares can not be taken back when a player goes inactive or changes corp , so i suggest that you do this via another method than shareholder dividends . 
  from the sale of his characters , probably . 
  even worse ; they 'll be directly paying corporations instead . 
  dismaying . 
  or the lack of broadband ? 
  power corrupts . 
  ask them what 's the timetable for making damage control units a passive module . 
  / ducks, 
  good luck with that fw devblog , 
  i often run a/1 logistics . 
  feels good having 860hp on a cheap frame , although the fitting room is tight . 
  i 'm waiting for the equipment sale . 
  last time i tried , down time was nine minutes . 
  as an australian , do n't care ; killed rabbits . 
  i think that ship has sailed . 
  is icl even available in oz ? 
  i posted a few old fits [ here ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/ ) . 
  i may have happened to buy 7500 charge sniper rifles when they were 4k each ... 
  i regret being reimbursed after buying 2500 saga iis :(, 
  there 's lots of ways to do it . 
  for instance , i am okay with unlocks for game modes . 
  i would be less-okay if it were something i had to constantly buy ( tickets ala tf2 pve mode ), 
  * totally unlike * australians , then ... 
  americans being offended just makes me want to offend them more . 
  lens replacement is different to this . 
  [ noice ] ( http://static.bf2s.com/files/user/20406/noice.jpg ), 
  i 'm not sold , but i would n't flip a table if it ended up that way . 
  says who ? 
  you can trade gtc numbers , why not this ? 
  small claims court . 
  very cheap costs , but max payout is also low . 
  its clearly * not * rmt . 
  now can we move from the ` unsubstantiated assertion ' phase of the discussion to the ` putting forth supporting arguments ' phase ? 
  ironically , he stopped working on aura until crest gets released .
