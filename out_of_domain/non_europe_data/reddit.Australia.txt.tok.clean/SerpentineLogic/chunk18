  i heard he loved cars but that 's just ridiculous . 
  those two are the main capacitor-related skills , but you might want jury rigging so you can fit capacitor control circuit rigs . 
  passive hardeners only provide better bonuses than t2 hardeners when you 're willing to drop 100m isk per hardener for deadspace-type energized platings . 
  and even then , you 're better off spending your isk on deadspace-type active hardeners instead . 
  however , in pvp , passive hardeners are often used because, 
  pvp ships have to be wary of energy neuts sucking their cap away, 
  pvp ships ca n't anticipate the incoming damage types , so must raise all their resistances at once , hence energized adaptive membranes . 
  yes , medium drones are like medium guns . 
  sentry drones iv -  v gives +5 % damage + access to t2 sentries ( +20 % damage ), 
  drone interfacing iv -  v gives +20 % drone damage . 
  gallente battleship iv -  v gives +10 % drone damage . 
  so , train first whichever gives you the most benefit . 
  * edited for retards *, 
  i would love an animated gif of the kills on a full fleet engagement . 
  not to be confused with ` auzzie ' which is how aussies pronounce aussie . 
   is it possible to price check different areas at once rather than flying station to station looking at the prices ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.eve-central.com ) . 
  can i have their stuff ? 
  i heard he had junk in his trunk . 
  `` twelve people too stupid to get out of jury duty '', 
  there 's a difference between being able to go into a 0.5 sec gallente system and a 1.0 sec system . 
  you might want to train diplomacy up a bit higher . 
  twenty , if he takes his socks off . 
  make it api only then . 
  i do n't even know what my strange addiction is . 
  fixed thx, 
  a north korean was quoted as saying that if you ca n't produce tears , you wipe some spit below your eyes because your entire career or life depends on it . 
  watching that thanatos crawl 50km back to station under heavy fire was epic . 
  self-appointed moral representatives do . . everyone knows someone who is rigid and uncompromising about following the rules . . 
  there 's even a meyers briggs personality type for it ( intj ) i believe . 
  well , in a police state , and those sorts of people end up being volunteer informants and informal deputies . 
  nah , most of the useful loot was the fighters that were abandoned when the carriers popped . 
   i. . . just realized from this discussion that `` gf '' does n't mean `` get fucked '', 
  sometimes it * does ~ *, 
  only three super caps . 
  it was mostly dreads and carriers on all four sides of the conflict .

  uh , and that 's because 80 % + of all diamonds mined are terrible , ( cracked , discolored , or tiny ), 
  do you have it in mercoxit ? 
  grab a 21 day trial from the thread on the sidebar . 
  diamond powder is sufficient . 
  for many people , sure . 
  it 's only 200m isk . 
  a fight in my home system on the weekend caused * two hundred times that * in losses . 
   the vindicator has that insane web bonus and normal sensor strength , the kronos has ... bonused tractor beams and extra highslots ? 
  also a semi-tech 2 resistance profile . 
  if you 're doing mining ( gah ) or industry/science stuff , the benefits of remapping to max intelligence + memory is self-evident . 
  in a few circumstances , remapping perception + willpower first is warranted ( if you want to skill up for a jump freighter , you can get all the piloting skills out of the way first , before all the jump drive support skills ) . 
  tech 1 ships are primary perception , secondary willpower . 
  there 's a [ full list here ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/skills_and_learning#attributes ) . 
  tech 2 ships are ( usually ) primary willpower , secondary perception . 
  generally , though , if you 're starting an alt rather than a main character , you only need to train one ship type so it 's usually not worth a remap for it . 
  if you 're doing a fleet boosting orca pilot , though , then it 's propably worth remapping to charisma to get multiple warfare link specializations to v. 
  do n't forget the [ okinawans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/pk9zc/til_that_during_world_war_ii_okinawan_civilians/ ) . 
  330 rapes per day by us troops would have stirred * a little bit * of discontent . 
  that 's an image i ca n't unimagine . 
  the nazi party is just misunderstood . 
  in fact , they believed that [ work sets you free ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeit_macht_frei ) , so they were just giving the jews as much freedom as they * possibly could * . 
  i think you miss the point of genocide there , mate . 
  lake ontario filled with chocolate pudding . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  that 's way more bearable than the one with putrefying limbs sticking ou-ohgod i did it * again * . 
  judgemental much ? 
  `` one estimate for the three-month period of the okinawa campaign exceeds 10,000 rapes of japanese women by american soldiers '' [ [ citation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_japan#cite_note-the_gi_war_against_japan-2 ) ], 
  that 's a lot , no matter which way you slice it . 
  says ` pal ' unironically ; confirmed as american . 
  speaking as an australian , i 'm not allowed to look at small boobs :(, 
  we ca n't even get in a tit about it unless the tit is a certain size . 
  training cap skills at the moment . 
  am tempted to win eve for a while . 
  srsly jump drive calibration v zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, 
  not quite so much , since crucible 1.1 dropped the cpu fitting on remote shield reps by a fair bit ( 175tf -  140tf ), 
  oh , biology iv is sufficient for popping some mindflood , blue pill or exile . 
  most of the random drawbacks do n't affect a ship configured in a carrier role ( this includes logistics ships , which should always undock with a standard mindflood imo ), 
  i think he meant having a 1mn mwd and 1mn afterburner on * at the same time . 
  ah , so at least you recognise good beer , and how fosters is an elaborate joked played by australia on the rest of the world . 
  that 's ok . we 'll never tell you when we mean ` get fucked ' . 
  practice ? 
  i know that eve tribune has a long history , but what types of articles does e-t select to differentiate itself from other sites such as en24 and the general blogosphere ? 
  same result . 
  i do n't expect politicians to be experts on every field . 
  i ** do ** , however , expect them to have competent staff members to help them formulate non-retarded positions on policy matters . 
  `` here , push this stupid position as a test of that loyalty you so openly profess to the public . '', 
  generally , any beer from tasmania is pretty decent . 
  probably because it was shoplifted from other web sites . 
  imagine the scene : you 're a surgeon , with your scalpel down a kid 's throat , cutting away their tonsils . 
  suddenly , a small hand grabs your knee from behind . 
  if i were a surgeon and had that happen to me , i think i 'd flip right out too . 
  first letter of each section in exocet . 
  because there 's a very small chance that ball will get into the hands of the cia , who will lift dna samples from it and cross-match it against known persons of interest , to your detriment . 
  it 's not paranoia , because many nations really were out to get him . 
  i doubt you 'd be so sanguine if he did . 
  quite choleric though , by the looks of it . 
  armor amount does n't matter because if you pop an exile , you 're already active tanking and probably have already lost 20 % of your armor . 
  you 'll either keep reps up , in which case you did n't need that 20 % armor , or you wo n't , in which case the 20 % will only prolong the inevitable . 
  ** tldr ; ** armor amount does n't matter if you have reppers, 
  if you 're under cap pressure as well as needing a booster to keep up reps , you 're already in trouble . 
  however , in the unlucky circumstance that you get the - capacitor drawback , your 20 % more efficient local reps will mostly compensate for your -20 % cap . 
  ** tldr ; ** deal with your drawback cancelling out your boost, 
  why not save yourself the sleepless nights worrying , and just keep the ball .
