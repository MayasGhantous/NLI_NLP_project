  it 's either go hard or go home for dust . 
  good post . 
  what 's with the calls to limit the number of siphons ? 
  not as if there 's a limit on bubbles . 
  from what i understand , war barges are only used when you 're deploying clone packs out of reach of your planetary network , otherwise you 'd tend to transfer clones via research facility or whatever ? 
  i 'm not absolving them , but the floods * were * kinda expensive . 
  also , it was in the middle of the gfc so you can forgive them for not posting stellar job figures . 
  am still pissed at fraser for selling off state assets to plug budget holes though . 
  that shit was bad under labor and is just getting worse under the lnp . 
  / r/subdreddit, 
  still almost double the population of australia . 
  then again , you guys probably lose fewer citizens to drop bears . 
  great for in-warp safes , since you can prepare while your drive is spinning up *, 
  ^ \\* results & nbsp ; may & nbsp ; vary & nbsp ; after & nbsp ; rubicon, 
  there were two zors implants . 
  monkey sphere ... 
  welp :(, 
  obligatory [ * accelerando * ] ( http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html ) reference . 
  i 'll ask the mods of / r/australia what up wit dat . 
  turns out they do n't like bots in / r/australia and were extra unimpressed by the long signature of the bot . 
   there are literally hundreds of bots operating on reddit at the moment . 
  if we let them all go much of the conversation would simply be bots shitting the place up . 
  snpashot_bot might 've got a better reception if the owner had specified asked about it , but it was just dropped on the subbredit in the same manner as other bots . 
  anyway , the comments it create are mostly repetitive in nature , it 's basically a self-advertising bot with a service linked to it . 
  i do n't think the service is worth the spam . 
  so perhaps ask him ? 
  would that make them harley quims ? 
  then you would have lived through the joh years . 
  well , there is a functional difference to the wallets of eve players orbiting buttons . 
  dust event ended tuesday downtime . 
   * we 're big down under ^ tm *, 
  so if they 're not working the way they intended , how are they supposed to work ? 
  low time to kill also plays a part . 
  why stack on hit points if it only buys you a quarter of a second ? 
  also , some people just do n't see the point in using expensive stuff for meaningless pub matches . 
  see : red vs blue . 
  i have no idea why this is n't more popular . 
  a squad of six with no vehicles is like the lowest barrier to entry ever . 
  i think tsole already has a squad organised ? 
  if not , i better kick some arses . 
  oh , ccp guard 's rates are much more reasonable . 
  somewhat difficult to achieve * before * they 're released . 
  i think tony might have an issue with a jump to the left . 
  \\  implying the nazis did n't put gay people into the same death camps they put jews . 
  why not just donate it to the angel project ? 
  bonus points if you get sindel to make a new song . 
  i turned off captain 's quarters because my laptop would combust . 
  personally , i think it 's pointless to expend resources on cq unless it 's to allow multiple players in the same room . 
  hell , even dust has players mingle in the control centre before deployment , so they can display their garish camouflage aurum dropsuits . 
  this is the first one for three weeks .

  i hear they [ wardecced this corp ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/pc+load+letter ) until it broke apart . 
  do n't goats eat it ? 
  they do a number on blackberry bushes in australia . 
  i like how other apps do it ( they automatically notice and store blueprint attributes when you research , copy or build from them ) but this sounds like a great way to load your initial back catalog of bpos . 
  planetary management is quite consistent . 
  even better , it happens when you 're doing other things . 
  battlefield heroes does this . 
  it 's a few bucks a week , if i recall correctly . 
  that adds up . 
  they just do n't want to port it until it 's not terrible . 
  which is fair . 
  probably not a good idea to alienate play station 4 players as well as play station 3 players . 
  yes , but you will need a corp api key . 
  thank tintin then . 
  at least you know something . 
  or medical clones , or implants . 
  scarpia , btw , is a villain from puccini 's * [ tosca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tosca ) * , whose extortion is referred to as the [ scarpia ultimatum ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/scarpiaultimatum ) . 
  [ ok then . 
  a small ship bay full of destroyers for bombardment duties ? 
  i 'm down with that . 
  or medical clones , 
  then the money from the sale should go into the future fund instead of being frittered away . 
  meet us half way . 
  how bout you list all the skills * you * think you 'll need , and we 'll tell you whether you 're missing any . 
  iceland should expect a lawsuit from larry ellison any day now .

  i put my corp-specific page on my phone . 
  i think it 's easy to tell . 
  if ea were n't greedy enough , he 'd have joined zynga . 
   part of me would like to see ccp rouge spend an hour every day reading through the forum archive . 
  that seems like a big waste of time for an executive level position . 
  far better to tell your staff `` find me some players who know what they 're talking about and ask them these questions , and i 'll look at what they wrote in the small amount of time i have spare between turning around this titanic and sleeping . '', 
  well , not so strange if that mmo were also made by the same company . 
  i have never heard that before . 
  sure . 
  i do n't often post forum threads here , but when i do , they 're corpmates ,

  nah , the admin went full retard . 
  it * could * be done on a tablet . 
  lots of console players feel that shooter games without weapon customisation are outdated . 
  then again , lots of players are retards , but their wallets are still full of money . 
  good to see you 're keeping abreast of things . 
  you 'd be surprised at the scope of arrangements between wait staff and kitchen staff happen in the us . 
  it 's practically a rulebook of its own . 
  personally , i 'd rather have more polish and better gameplay than weapon customisation , but some people really like their bling . 
  for op 's sake , i dearly hope those weird circle designs in the background are n't keyed to individuals ,
