  hmm , guess it 's too soon . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  you are the best . 
  ignore all those other people . 
  well , it does have a spool-up time like a turret . 
  that 's going to make things a little difficult if you get surprised . 
  it also means people can pop out of cover and plink you to death in relative safety . 
  on the other hand , it 's a very long range weapon to have full auto , even if it 's only ~ 7.5 bullets per second . 
  life : you 're doing it right . 
  ... hopefully no - i think the sony-ccp relationship is abusive . 
  it 's in the weapon sheet for the rail rifle . 
  what do those things sell for anyway ? 
  [ player count charts since 2003 . 
  ] ( http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/charts/subs-2.png ), 
  1 / 0.05 seconds = 20 rounds per second , thus 1200 rounds per minute ( complicated because that 's the burst rate rather than full auto ) but you can work out the other ones from that . 
  not sure . 
  syncaine has a blog that talks about am most , i think he had a few articles on their failures . 
  ha , i had my first triple kill last night as well . 
  australia : just another centrist country . 
  i used to love the 30 % above minimum wage casual rate i was getting at pizza haven as a teenager . 
  of course , the minimum wage for someone my age was like $ 5.50 per hour back then , but hey , 30 % . 
  that 's what it is in australia . 
  and yet , we somehow deal with it . 
  paid double but cost of living is doubled too ? 
  that means the 10 % left over buys you twice as much stuff from overseas . 
  it 's free , and you were going to get a ps3 anyway , so yeah of course . 
  there 's even passive skill training . 
  mother of god, 
  you need to kick start your professional experience with open source projects or a start up . 
  under no circumstances do you want to be run of the mill in an industry that is so easy to out source . 
  i suspect there are non-conservatives making trolling articles on conservapedia . 
  however , the fact that these edits are n't caught is damning in itself . 
  i think the problem is that selling only 35000 copies of a game is hardly going to break even , and they 're trying to work out how to make some actual money from it . 
  that means , either allow non-vr users to play , or to get a kickback from another company . 
  there ** are ** plenty to hunt . 
   if it is truly legal and you have all this set up i would liquidate it all . 
  take your $ 1,300 in cash out and start a new fw alt . 
  i would take the $ 1300 in cash and go to cancun . 
  rebuttal : somer provides credits rather than actual isk , and you only get to cash out if you win a game of chance, 
  *** re *** - rebuttal : what if you got / u/franticdaz credits , which you only get to cash out if you win a game of skill ? 
  ( answering questions based on his posting history ) ? 
  referral kickbacks should only be out of game , if you 're paying real money . 
  if some says ` buy in game items off me and get free blink credit ' then that 's okay . 
  i do n't mind it if i have a squad backing me up , but it 's a bit rough when you drop into a game and it 's full of proto suits . 
  maybe i should make a blueprint suit with prototype grenades , just to spoil their isk efficiency ... 
  asian here . 
  why would you want non sticky rice ? 
  well , i really like australian rice . 
  heaven knows where they get enough water to grow it . 
  you export foster 's but keep boags . 
  pot kettle black , mate . 
  you do wash your rice , right ? 
  they probably grow most of the rice in the murray darling basin , which does n't have as much water as it used to . 
  tldr washed rice is less gluggy but if you need the vitamins in american rice , do n't . 
  before . 
  then again , it depends on the type of rice . 
  i do n't wash arborio rice because i want the glugginess in my risottos . 
  i also do n't buy long grain rice . 
  you know there 's an option to show keyboard bindings for menu items , right ? 
  buy a capital component blueprint , research it , sell it for more than you paid ? 
  i find unwashed calrose rice to be too sticky for my taste , but a few washes in cold water ( enough to remove most of the cloudiness from the water ) makes it the right consistency when cooked . 
  \\ ^ most important post, 
  he also happened to be a very skilled inventor of automata . 
  yes , they did have the edge sanded off them . 
  they should give you extra isk for each queue you 're willing to join ... 
  i remember ditching cba for hsbc when they introduced the account keeping fee . 
   [ so , a lot has changed in the last month . 
  is much reduced from its heyday , slimming down from 47 % district control to 15 % , due to the loss of teamplayers as a district holder in its own right , the combined efforts of the fuck eon coalition , and let 's be honest , grand theft auto v has played its part . 
   we see a few new players dipping their toes into planetary conquest , with latinos killers corp and s.a.l.u.k.i gaining districts . 
  test alliance and goonswarm federation 's token holdings remain ; one expects that holding many districts is not a strategic goal for them , so you 're more likely to see them in faction warfare than in pc battles . 
   the southern legion continues to chip away at any reinforcement timers in their time zone , but so far have n't managed to take any districts from nyain san , who recently put their hand up and formed an alliance with a massive 16 % territorial control . 
  can they retain it ? 
  more accurately , can anyone else in their time zone take it off them ? 
   dust uni remains fairly stable on 2 % control , but the real surprise is the number of large land-holding corps who are unaffiliated with alliances : valor , wtf , outer heaven and ancient exiles having almost 30 % district control between them . 
  it will be interesting to see whether that trend persists once war barge strikes are removed from planetary conquest battles . 
  nothing says `` i have friends in high places '' more than orbital strikes on tap . 
   after their turn as top dog a few months ago , rofl has regrouped and remains a non-trivial player in molden heath . 
  its corps and territories position it as a strong euro timezone force , but it 's up against some strong competition outside its timezone . 
   league of infamy and public disorder continue to hold territory , although less than last month , chipped away by a number of larger corps and alliances . 
  public disorder in particular is hurting without solid support from sver true blood , so the bloodshed might not be over yet . 
   all in all , things are looking quite interesting on the ground in molden heath . 
  i suspect that an active scanner would be a good addition to your fit . 
  also , you probably do n't have the fitting room for it , but a nitrous fuel injection system can provide a handy boost to speed and acceleration when you need to traverse areas without cover . 
  they do it because they can . 
  many people set up automated transfers ( both in and out ) and when hit with additional charges say `` meh , too much effort to switch '' . 
  or a property fund . 
  house prices go up ? 
  fund does correspondingly well . 
  house prices go down ? 
  fund does poorly , does n't matter because houses are cheap as well . 
  if you 're white , chinese companies will hire you just to visibly be an employee when they need to impress visiting business contacts . 
  `` cooked venomous crab '' . 
  it also has orange stripes in between the red/pink ones . 
   well , it is wikipedia , you can just make it say whatever you want ... 
  -- abraham lincoln, 
  especially considering you 've obviously got a billion isk to create the alliance .
