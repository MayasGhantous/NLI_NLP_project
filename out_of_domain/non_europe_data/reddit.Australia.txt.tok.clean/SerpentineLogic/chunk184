   thanks ,, 
   - greyscale, 
   [ edit ] looked at the numbers again , i 'm going to pull the ceiling up from 400 to 450 . 
  welp, 
  nope , just that you will be bell-curved down if you peak above an average of 450wp/minute , with a hard cap of 500wp * length of game in minutes . 
  i used to do a lot of lowsec pi in [ nalvula ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/lonetrek/nalvula#sec ) , since i could easily jump in from highsec , refill silos and other stuff , then leg it back through the gate . 
  i got locked up once by some pirates , but i negotiated +5 standings with the corp that ran the customs offices , which meant that i only had to worry about 20 % of the inhabitants instead of 100 % . 
  also i got better customs taxes , which was nice . 
  tldr ; do it . 
  epithals are cheap . 
  once you block everyone in jita that scams , it 's actually a decent channel . 
  res has you tagged as +5 , i guess we have a non-aggression pact . 
  nobody wants a video of your semi . 
  except possibly xenuria . 
  no , because, 
  each person needs to learn how to spot bullshit for themselves, 
  the list would get out of date, 
  3 . : effort :, 
  nope , just assholes . 
  i have accidentally called an rdv onto a corpmate 's dropship during a planetary conquest match . 
  they were * a bit * cross with me . 
  have you seen the bug where the rdv pretends to drop the vehicle , then the next instant it 's dropping from the rdv again , and again , and again , getting closer to the ground each time before disappearing ? 
  what can i say ? 
  i 'm a good poster . 
  there are players who specialize in kamikaze-style tactics against other , more expensive dropships . 
  i think there 's a youtube video out there . 
   do n't upvote, 
  fuck you i wo n't do what you [ tell me ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-ccp-mystery-code-demystified ), 
  truly , you are missing out . 
  i remember thinking `` this game is literally trolling me '', 
  i get that a lot . 
  no i do n't . 
  they only count as caught if their readers, 
  1 . find out, 
  2 . care, 
  meh , it 's a bit of a wash . logis have more slots to put stuff on , which is a bigger advantage than you 'd think . 
  i have assault v , but if i 'm not using specific fits , i 'll just walk around with my advanced logi suit instead . 
  nope . 
  bootcamp by far . 
  some of us have known about this [ since 2011 ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/crucible-item-spoiler/ ) ... 
  all eve time code affiliates were served 10 days notice to stop providing incentives to buy through them . 
  ok , so they can still say `` hey , get $ 1 off your gtc if you go through us '' . 
  which is fine , because anyone can do that . 
  i hope they fix manus peak soon . 
  it 's so badly-designed in comparison . 
  australian , here . 
  this is what we do . 
  an extra [ 9.25 % of our salary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superannuation_in_australia ) gets paid into our personal retirement funds by our employer ( it then gets taxed at 15 % going in ) . 
  you get your choice of fund , and can roll over between funds if you decide your current one is terrible . 
  [ this one . 
  ] ( http://wiki.dust514.info/images/8/8c/manuspeak_skirmish.jpg ), 
  i 've been sniped off the control point at a after running straight there from my spawn in a scout suit . 
  apparently you can set up a redline sniper nest in about 20 seconds after the game starts :(, 
  try again ? 
  everyone else can see it . 
  ok i 'll take 19 . 
  the first time you fit a particular ship for pve , it should * always * have a damage control . 
  after all , the initial phase when you 're not familiar with how it operates is the most likely time for you to dip into structure . 
  they can operate to make a profit while still acting as a semi-cheap option to stop other companies from charging outrageously , though . 
  they 're 35m ^ 3 now . 
  i do n't think they 're a lot more expensive though ? 
  no , it 's only gatherings of three or more people , so / r/brisbane is safe . 
  and homeless people who suddenly get paid to pick up litter . 
  well , not the good ones . 
  not officially , anyway . 
  i do n't even, 
  fox four and nullarbor are working on this at the moment . 
  you really need to do the sums , or have [ something do it for you ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/28661/-1/5/-1/5 ) .

  i hear the next release will make the slider * even smaller * , 
  yeah personal ownership of vehicles is a big thing in dust . 
  net 0 via dollar cost , absolutely ( assuming power companies and governments do n't move the goalposts like newman did to qld ), 
  net 0 by carbon footprint ? 
  numbers might be different . 
  it was really a sting-ray . 
  i remember when games did n't have mouse support . 
  hell , i remember when * computers * did n't have mouse support . 
  have you investigated whether it 's cheaper to send her overseas to study than in the us ? 
  you 'd be mad , too , if you had to type in a game by typing in lines of basic from the back of a book , only to find out there 's a typo in the book and you ca n't fix the program because you 're only seven years old . 
  although , i 'm now a programmer , so there 's that . 
  hmm , turns out medicine is $ 57k per year for international students in australia , vs 10k per year for citizens . 
  that 's probably not any cheaper than the us , especially with our exchange rate :(, 
  well , if you 're a citizen , you get university for $ 10k per year , 
  but yeah it can be hard to get a working visa in australia , especially if you 're over 30 and/or unwilling to work in the outback . 
  [ this guy . 
   saying that the anonymous tagline is a threat is the same as saying that `` always , coca cola '' insinuates that the caffeinated beverage is the key to eternal life . 
  sudden betrayal is sudden ? 
  i do n't know . 
  australia has the luxury of having no land borders . 
  however , it 's also one of the strictest in the world for family reunion and refugee visas , so it 's a pretty cold-hearted policy . 
  i loved him in * ghost * . 
  station . 
  it 's fairly safe , provided you choose the [ right ship ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ) . 
  ventures should be fine when you 're actively watching , but they 'll fold fairly quickly to npc pirates . 
  for players , it really depends on how much of a target you are , and you can choose your ship carefully so you 're too much effort to kill , at the expense of slightly less mining yield .
