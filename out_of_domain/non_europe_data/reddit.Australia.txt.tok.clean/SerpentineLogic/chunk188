  less often than i 'd like . 
  as has been disclosed , a partial respec has been announced for uprising 1.7 's vehicle changes , so you 'll be able to experience one quite soon . 
  kite like kil2 in a talos . 
  stuff like this happens from time to time - being lumped with problems of previous government is the price you pay for taking credit for the success of the previous government . 
  it 's all how you handle it . 
  he handled it badly . 
  now with extra words :, 
  were you not paying attention to the media ? 
  it got pinned on them , so they had to explain why it was a global thing and not domestic mismanagement . 
  which they did explain , and the public accepted it . 
  deflecting bad things and taking credit for good things is how politics works , so in that regard , the gfc thing was a non-issue . 
  nice to see you 're abreast of things . 
  was n't that movie about the great emperor nasi goreng ? 
  it was originally posted two days ago . 
  there 's an indiana jones gif begging to be made . 
  instructions unclear ; on a plane to vermont . 
  you 're a glutton for punishment , are n't you ? 
  also , comms channels are great for inviting eve players to throw orbital bombardments at your enemies . 
  there 's a big difference between what ccp intended , and what should actually happen ... 
  also , they sell sausages at the voting booths so you can eat while you wait in line . 
  he 's good at giving pointers . 
  yeah it 's quite newtonian . 
  there 's ~ ~ an app ~ ~ a web site for that . 
  yes . 
  i thought this was laplace for it . 
  averted by breathing through your nose . 
  i 'd say if 500k sp is so important , buy a 30-day booster pack with 15 % discount this week ( so , ~ 40000 aur ) and do both . 
  doing it right . 
  hope this turns out as good as project arek ` jaalan did for wormholes . 
  no bug reports since 2013-11-04 . 
  no feedback/suggestion reports since 2013-11-04 either . 
  starting with the rubber bits . 
  is that so wrong ? 
  it 's one cyno to syndicate , and within the sphere of influence of a bunch of ~ ~ nullbear ~ ~ er , elite pvp citizen alliances , so why go all the way to jita if you can get it closer ? 
  working as intended . 
  there is . 
  there 's even a connection between the warp drives on the sisters ships and worm holes . 
  so , advanced and prototype weapons are being buffed across the board ? 
  okay ... 
  they do occasionally get shot on subway platforms , though . 
   wetware mainframe, 
  401k is where bob went . 
  welp, 
  well , yeah , that 's implicit . 
  however , if you do n't pay taxes , you still get the healthcare . 
  teamplayers left , stb is awol , there 's not much left of eon . 
  also the really basic guide :, 
  but where would the yanks get all their best actors then ?

  til the broker is actually professor moriarty . 
  no , it 's probably just the first gun she 's ever seen . 
  heck , i 've only seen three guns in my life , none of them pistols . 
   how do i find tier 2 agents after i 've done the tier 1 tutorials/missions ? 
  answered above . 
   when do they unlock ? 
  based on standings with the faction ( or corporation - corp standings increase faster and more reliably ) . 
  train connections skill to get a head start on friendly standings , and social skill to make each increase bigger from then on . 
  connections iii should be enough to parachute you into level 2 mission agents . 
   how do i make isk following the combat path ? 
  blow stuff up, 
  not die, 
  it 's more complicated than that and there 's [ lots you can do ] ( http://www.swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ ) . 
  missions is n't the only way to get a source of red crosses to kill , but it is the most structured so it makes a good fallback . 
   when should i join a corp ? 
  now would be a good time to start looking . 
  at the very least , join estel arador corp services and install some jump clones in highsec , then leave . 
  having a jump clone is quite useful . 
   should i just train skills that i pick up along the way , or max out what i can now ? 
  i spend almost two months just training useful skills up to iii . 
  past a certain point you should specialize or you 'll be terrible at everything , but universal skills are worth putting at least a couple of fast skill levels into ( e.g. 
  +10 % capacitor size , and +10 % agility and +10 % shield size and +10 % armor hp can all be done in about one day ), 
  more to the point , if rent has to drop to $ 200/week but the house only costs $ 200k to buy instead of $ 400k , that 's actually a decent return and nothing to complain about , so there 's a lot of slack in the future rental market from a margin perspective . 
  i hereby dub them ` choppers ' . 
  whoah , what are we , [ france ] ( http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/archive/segment/teenage-girl-crucified-in-france/5255b53f78c90a26bb000249 ) ? 
  bombs , for instance . 
  obviously not the * adult * cowboys . 
  pos management interface, 
  al pls, 
  yeah , one would expect mining corps to have at least a small industrial arm for building barges , mining crystals etc. 
  they die sooner , so less pension costs ? 
  your loan interest is . 
  not getting all their stuff stolen by poor people comes to mind . 
  except valkyrie will probably cost money to purchase , so ccp will actually make some money this time . 
  some of the sheep . 
  gum trees are self - pruning . 
  that means they drop huge branches without warning . 
  do not sleep under a gum tree . 
  no , although we do have poison octopus . 
  because the animals are also australian . 
  tea tree oil has healing properties . 
  also , the honey is good vs staphylococcus infections . 
  that fact does not invalidate the comment that gum trees can and do kill people . 
  in that case , go for it . 
  be prepared to drop thirty bucks on plex to replace it though . 
  what ? 
  mine is like 4 % , although it 's only that low because there 's 5 % pocos nearby . 
  oh , you mean the premier who used to be mayor of brisbane when the decision was made ?
