  i do n't think that will work somehow . 
  you 've really backed him into a coroner . 
  minimum wage in australia is [ scaled down ] ( http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx ) if you 're younger than 21 . 
  it allows teenagers to have a chance to get some work because they 're being paid as little as 40 % of minimum wage , but as they get older and get more experience , their income automatically rises . 
   there 's a publish or parish mentality amongst academics . 
  that looks like a clerical error . 
  only two of the racial skills actually pertain to logistics . 
  that 's probably not ideal . 
  they charged twenty bucks for a large pizza in the early 1980s . 
  that 's a fucking expensive pizza and explains why we did n't go very often . 
  that 's a lot of aurum to spend to get stuff , especially since i just dropped 40k aurum on a discounted 30 day booster bundle . 
  well , you 'll deplete the area faster the more you extract , so there 's also the increased overhead of moving the extractor around the place . 
  it works on the rift now . 
  will it be released on the rift or will a large company pay them lots of money to release on other hardware ? 
  that 's a different kettle of fish . 
   in cantonese , the word for `` dog '' is pronounced jee-oh,

  get out, 
  australian here . 
  we can afford it . 
  thanks for your concern . 
  at first , it 's quite difficult . 
  after a while though , you 'll find it fairly easy to plex your accounts , at least from time to time . 
  generally though , it 's best to be prepared to pay your subscription and use plex to extend it if you come into some money . 
  good to see they looked at the [ numbers we showed them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sztbib6.png?1 ) and changed their minds on this .

  does that new reddit industrial corp have a subreddit ? 
  i do n't doubt that we did . 
  especially since rail and combat rifles do a lot more damage to armor than scrams do . 
  this was just about the bonus sp weeks ; there 's longer-term plans to adjust how the active sp bonus happens , which they have not disclosed . 
  the bundles are already discounted by about 20 % . 
  well , you know the base price of the bpo , and you know its me and pe stats . 
  you can use various tools like fuzzworks to work out how long it took to research to that level . 
  then figure something like 12k isk per hour for me research and 2k isk per hour for pe research and that 's a ballpark figure . 
  i guess it 's a bit different if it 's economic espionage instead of security related . 
  i 'll accept that answer . 
  everybody lies . 
  learn to read between the lies .

  they even had a phrase for icelandic women wanting to hook up with servicemen : [ \u00c1standi\u00f0 \\ ( the condition \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81standi%c3%b0 ), 
   learn to make it profitable for them to lie to others and get a cut of the proceeds . 
  that 's another thing i learned from eve : think more than one step ahead . 
  preferably two or three . 
  marauders are being buffed !, 
  planning : i should train for a marauder !, 
  forward thinking : i should also start saving for a marauder, 
  next-level planning : i should start building marauders to sell to others, 
  second-level planning : time to start manipulating materials used to build marauders, 
  i learned metagaming from magic : the gathering . 
  does n't matter how good your burn deck is if the meta is hostile to burn . 
  so , of course the first thing you do is to build a deck that can operate in the current meta . 
  then you build a deck designed to prey on the current metagame , or warp it to your purposes ( i.e. 
  make the meta weak towards burn decks then rock up at the next tournament packing mountains and own all ), 
  and there 's like 6 other parts to the series . 
  i especially like the last part , which i call `` what happens when people like mittens get to the top and realise it 's a hollow victory '', 
   the scumbag hat is just a prop . 
  i think of it as the [ seventh hat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six_thinking_hats ) .

  or perhaps he realised that the pm just foisted that policy on him to stunt his career and appease the right , and finally managed to make it disappear from media attention so he could concentrate on not being unpopular .

  gillard was good given the parliament she had to work with , but most of the things she took credit for were kicked off by rudd . 
  whitlam was awesome , but a lot of things were undone by fraser , also it was a long time ago so it 's not in the public consciousness . 
  the 20 buck merc pack is great value and i strongly recommend it . 
  the fifty buck veteran pack is also similarly great value but fifty bucks may be too high . 
  it does , however have different stuff including a blueprint for a jeep which is pretty neat and the reason i bought it . 
  he elite pack is also great but a hundred bucks is a lot and the overlapbetween the veteran and elite dissuaded me . 
  so , depending on your financial situation , i suggest buying , in this order :, 
  * a veteran pack, 
  * another merc pack, 
  note that any of the three packs is way , way better value than anything else available on the psn store for dust , which is part of the reason why they 're being removed . 
  this is the best deal you 're likely to get for the foreseeable future .
