  to illustrate the nature of eve lore , let me tell you a true story . 
  about a year ago , a capsuleer in w-space found some abandoned ships in a wormhole . 
  if they 'd checked the owner of the ship and googled their name , they 'd have discovered that it belonged to a character mentioned as going missing after the crielere incident and stuck in unknown space for the last few months ( since the apocrypha expansion ), 
  if they 'd boarded the ship , they would have discovered that its cargohold contained a unique datacore full of secrets about the sleepers ; worthless to the uninitiated , but priceless in the hands of a collector or one of new eden 's research cadre . 
  instead , they blew the ship up for cluttering their d-scan , and all that knowledge was lost . 
  delving into the mysteries of eve lore will be a frustrating affair , like recreating a centuries-old stained glass window with only the pieces of glass not yet stolen by thieves and tourists . 
  new pieces of information trickle in as people find them ( and ccp dropbear inserts them ) , but players can actively participate as well , such as by building that outpost for the arek jalaan project . 
  i suggest chatting with them and seeing where you can contribute . 
  read [ know your enemy ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/p/article-index.html ) articles , gain enlightenment . 
  france is bacon . 
  of course there was . 
  just go through a bunch of wormholes looking for her ship . 
  the themepark/sandbox dichotomy is also mirrored in the narrativism/simulationist approach to back story . 
  if you were playing mass effect , the entire game universe pauses until you decide where to look next for the missing ship . 
  ( and the ships is always there for you to find ), 
  in eve , the game universe continues , whether anyone goes looking or not .

   also ; what is the `` double bubble '' hictor fitting people are talking about and why would that be advantageous ? 
  other posters have already talked about the double bubble ** dic ** tor fits and how useful they are . 
  double-bubble [ ** hic ** tor fits ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/fotw-super-cap-tackling-phobos.html ) are rarer , but are useful to keep a supercap instantly bubbled while still locking them up to get a focused point on them .

  what will really happen :, 
  player gets a warning, 
  player sells his character and rolls up another bot . 
  i 'm sure ccp dropbear has learned his lesson , 
  if you 're getting into pvp for the first time , it 's better to spend the isk on two dozen frigates and lose them all , than to fit a couple of cruisers for the same price . 
  when you do n't have a lot of experience , you want lots of fights as quickly as possible , so you stop making stupid mistakes . 
  to that end , i suggest you buy and fit a few dozen rifters or whatever , join [ red vs blue ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/red_vs_blue_\\ ( rvb \\ ) ) and do n't leave until you 've lost them all . 
  come back when you 've lost them all , and post an update :p,

  skills have a primary stat and a secondary stat . 
  the primary stat makes the most difference to training time , so you want the best implants in those stats . 
  all gunnery , missile , and most spaceship command skills have perception as their primary stat . 
  ( it also is a secondary stat for drones and t2 spaceship command skills ), 
  all electronics , engineering , mechanics , navigation and science skills have intelligence as their primary stat . 
  so , if you find you switch training between support and combat skills , plug the +5 s into perception and intelligence . 
  the payoff for +5 implants in secondary skills is so long that i recommend keeping them at +4 . 
  if you plan to fly in lowsec : train for a battlecruiser , since it has sufficient dps and tank at the same time .
