  i would like to also put bounties on entire corps or alliances . 
  imma let you finish , but i have my spare isk earmarked for the philippines . 
  i think australians train for us tanks . 
  which makes sense ; the only time we deploy tanks is when the americans are invading someone , so why not borrow theirs ? 
  yeah , but logistically , why haul them from australia to the middle east when we can just drive around in the tanks the americans already transported there ? 
  come over to steal football cups ? 
  then why did n't it happen in the 1970s ? 
  do you [ have any evidence ] ( http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1300000/everybody-lies-house-md-1395807-1280-1024.jpg ) substantiating this ? 
  perhaps you 're thinking of otherland , where the curses were in cantonese . 
  okay well you 'll need at least something . 
  plex 4 hours , give money , contract over everything else . 
  sauce please, 
  not that there 's anything wrong with bondage . 
  it 's to counteract the saying ` you 're either right or you 're wrong ', 
  for low skill point characters , a gnosis would be a very good choice in the battle cruiser size bracket . 
  glad you liked it . 
  why not both ? 
  well , there was the black friday 99c-for-your-first-month deal . 
  the main thrust of gonski was funds * reallocation * ; giving extra money via a flawed allocation system just perpetuates the wrongness . 
  tldr ; the money 's nice , but the drama ( and monetary cost , and political price ) was totally avoidable by just going with gonski like originally stated .

  the iron giant ? 
  same director and writer . 
  heck , the lead character in d9 was also in elysium . 
  `` i always wanted a waf '', 
  yeah fairly certain it 's us only . 
  i often get courier contracts filled for 50k/jump . 
  i honestly do n't know why people bother . 
  considered running up a windows vm using parallels or whatever ? 
  in a wormhole ? 
  no idea . 
  outside a wormhole , probably easiest to put up buy orders in station . 
  corp members either sell to you , or if someone overbids you , they get more money . 
  either way , they win . 
  too busy developing eve . 
  omega booster works out to a bit less than 20 % extra for your aurum . 
  even articles under her non-gg persona are relentlessly followed by creepers :(, 
  are you too lazy for iviewnapper as well ? 
  good save . 
   who is the best game dev that you guys have had the pleasure of meeting, 
  and why is it ccp fozzie . 
  at king 's canyon ? 
  no , that 's pretty much what it looks like when you look up at night . 
  please ask devs for missiles from space , preferably guided ones that lock-onto tanks . 
  all the most recent maps are actually joined ( you can fly up in a dropship and see other maps ) . 
  so , it 's not impossible , but probably not soon . 
  hope it 's a deadspace cookie . 
  the libs sure are digging a lot of holes for themselves lately . 
  do n't sweat it ; op just went full venn diagram on you . 
  well , in australia , we usually use private prisons for locking up immigrants rather than citizens . 
  for a country with `` for those who come across the seas/we 've boundless plains to share '' in its national anthem , it has a real xenophobia problem . 
  because sysdate - 30 is too hard to put into an sql script ... 
  yeah , ds4 works on the ps3 for dust , but only when plugged in ( i do n't think it works wirelessly ), 
  from what i 've heard , the ds4 triggers work really well for dust - people really like how it feels . 
  singapore airlines -  owned by singapore govt . 
  in fact , many national airlines are propped up by their host nations . 
  yeah . 
  many airlines have stakes in virgin . 
  air new zealand , singapore airlines , etihad etc. 
  the logic 's a bit shaky though ; sure , the singapore government will bail out sg if they need to , but i do n't think they 'll lift a finger if virgin gets in trouble ( except perhaps by buying more shares for cheap ), 
  shhhhh !, 
  settle down . 
  it 's only shield depleted delay . 
  if you reach zero shields in a shield tanked suit you 're probably screwed anyway . 
  heavy trains often put the brakes on and accelerate when they go down a hill , because the last thing they want is to have the back of the train going faster than the front then derail . 
  catalyst . 
  oh , in that case,

  he 's not here to ruin the game ; he 's just here to ruin * your * game . 
  anyone in a light frame . 
  not a tragedy ; a triumph . 
  join east khanid or some other mining corp that 's not so authoritarian, 
  power projection is a pet hate . 
  ekt was my first corp. 
  stayed there a few months . 
  nice guys , bit risk averse at times but hey , at least they log in . 
  that post has single handedly set off my scam alarm . 
  one thing that blueberries do is not drop uplinks when needed . 
  i often turn up halfway through a game to find zero uplinks and have to drive around the map like johnny apple seed . 
  oh determined people will just push you away from the tank with a lav then drive back and get in .
