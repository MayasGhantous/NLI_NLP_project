  my family has been in australia for fifty years longer than pauline hanson . 
  so , she can fuck right back to where * she * came from . 
  yes , that 's how it works . 
  your point being ... ? 
  a sense of honour . 
  hey , vegemite is concentrated beer , it was only a matter of time before a use was found for it . 
  google new eden research . 
  not to mention the applications for wi fi ... 
  vermont is going forward with non retarded healthcare . 
  lots of states are watching with interest . 
  you ca n't be best poster . 
  sacul is . 
  do n't know about airlines , but the recent car manufacturer bribes to stay in australia cost 70 000 dollars per job saved . 
  just give the workers the money directly and stop fucking around . 
  anything from australia . 
  not sure where i read the 70,000 / worker figure , but if you figure $ 100m in subsidies saves 1500 jobs , it works out pretty close . 
  edit : also , there 's a case to be made for strategic subsidies in manufacturing and primary production because when the shit hits the fan , the country might really need people who know how to grow food or make machinery ( or , more likely , make the robots that make the machinery ) . 
  i think the auto manufacture bailout goes beyond that , though . 
  ( ditto for qantas , imo ), 
  yeah china sourced a lot of milk from nz after the melamine contamination scare . 
  i 'll eat some white rabbit sweets as penance . 
  i 'm sure he looks forward to the bounty you plan to put on him , then . 
  hey , at least there 's a reason . 
  it 's also a lot more than a hundred million dollars subsidy per year , too . 
  lost . 
  let 's be realistic . 
  not * that * huge . 
  nope . 
  could always run up a vm with windows in it , though . 
  yes , the ds4 works in dust , but only while plugged in via cable . 
  you mean the [ grape soda ] ( http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tentacle-grape-soda/ ) ? 
  until the tourists died of dysentery . 
  i do n't know if this is true but i 'm upvoting this just for its plausibility . 
  ... just like anything else pos-related . 
  i have an old barely-intel macbook that runs eve fine . 
  i occasionally burn my legs because the cpu gets to 80 ^ o c and generally runs really hot , but if i can run it , you can run it . 
  [ virtual machine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtual_machine ) , like parallels or vagrant . 
  a [ natural monopoly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_monopoly ) is a situation where a monopoly is the * most * efficient way to operate . 
  a single-provider healthcare system may or not be a natural monopoly , but gas/electricity/water / internet transmission networks definitely are . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people are ass men . 
  case in point : contractors working on the death star . 
  they 're the ones who rsvp when your invitation email is still a draft . 
  who knew being under constant surveillance would be bad for morale ... 
  also , put him on your contacts list so you know when he logs on . 
  i mean , that 's what reddit is for . 
  you could always try your hand at industry , if that floats your boat . 
  log in , set up ten jobs of 12 talwars , come back the next day , take to market , buy minerals set up another ten jobs . 
  you 'll need production efficiency v before you start making most stuff though ( pe v adds 8m isk to your profit when building a battleship , for instance ), 
  message me your ign and i 'll contract you a couple of bpcs to get you started . 
  is it too much to ask to rig my freighter ? 
  seriously ? 
  they made their bed ; let them lie in it . 
  for those who do n't want to go to smh : [ pics ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvmzatg.jpg ) . 
  maybe he was so white he wrapped around . 
  the best thing about having low standards is going through life surrounded by beautiful women . 
  mention / u/snapshot _ bot and a url in the same comment . 
  does n't work in this subreddit because the mods said no . 
  i bought a 30-day bundle just 2 weeks ago :(, 
  i did a lot of havens before i got sick of them . 
  sure , why not . 
  saves you buying all the infrastructure and you can use the blueprints they already have . 
  to be fair , we were abducting them with good ( ish ) intentions given the mores at the time , not to oppress them . 
  so , basically , ron weasley . 
  conversely , the expats who emigrated * during * apartheid are extra-nice people . 
  .50 cal rifle = [ harmless ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvstulijrm8 ) after 14 inches of water , but slower velocity rounds can travel up to 8 feet . 
  so , it 's still a bit dicey given the volume of lead being fired at you . 
  child protection services would disagree . 
  +1 implants pay off after 18 hours or something . 
  or anyone playing dust . 
  the amarr logi has a 3/3/3 layout , which is pretty great in comparison . 
  the rail rifle is n't really a surprise . 
  foxfour works on eve/dust link , so it 's unlikely to be item-related . 
  i 've seen their kdrs . 
  it 's kinda the other way around . 
  they 're promoting its existence ? 
  i 'm prepared to make it rain . 
  except gay people . 
  is it really smuggling if they have a valid plane ticket ?

  yeah i could burn through 10m isk per day for five years straight just from the isk i have on my eve account . 
  who does n't ? 
  remember , women do n't want to hear what you think . 
  they want to hear what * they * think , in a deeper voice . 
  but she stays for the same reason that ambulance people or firemen stay instead of finding better paying jobs . 
  they are the type of person who cares about others instead of themselves . 
  it 's sad , but people with these personality types will always lose out on negotiations compared to mercenary types . 
  they spend all the profits on paying themselves . 
  american hospitals are the same . 
  anything warning people how dangerous australia is , for one thing . 
   look back over the past , with its changing empires that rose and fell , and you can foresee the future , too . 
  this has been my experience , yes . 
  no , i do n't understand it either . 
  that party would get my vote . 
  well , you know what they say about scouts ... 
  i saw tanks going faster than dropships , jumping over walls and stuff . 
  not sure if that was quite intended . 
  yeah its pretty awesome watching a tank use the mound near the cru on the mushroom outpost as a jump ramp and shoot into the air . 
  it 's hard to accrue dust isk . 
  a million isk per hour is good money .
