  it 's a credible alternative . 
  [ it has begun ] ( http://dust.thang.dk/showgearcomparison.php?gear=356594,365424,352293,356593 ), 
  which party re-nationalised it , incidentally ? 
  turns out that militia nitrous systems are +100 % speed instead of +10 % speed . 
  welp, 
  it 's a bit hard to fit stuff , but t3s are due for a balance pass so it 's not going to get any worse in the future . 
  oh i love love * love * having my stocking stuffed . 
  i miss you too , although that 's probably because i have aim assist disabled . 
  we just [ went through a war ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/homeless/ ) with those guys . 
  ( it did n't go well for us ), 
  separate ** tabs ** for fittings . 
  generally , when i run pc , i want all the proto suits but none of the rest . 
  similarly , when i 'm running cost-effective fits , i do n't want anything from the pc tier . 
  tengu defensive -- amplification node, 
  tengu electronics -- dissolution sequencer, 
  tengu engineering -- augmented capacitor reservoir, 
  tengu offensive -- accelerated ejection bay, 
  tengu propulsion -- fuel catalyst, 
  fit to taste . 
  or qantas , even though i suspect a bit of creative accounting with them . 
  join channel ` pie ground control ' then x up when dust players type in the planet they 're fighting on, 
  can you tie it into another aspect of your life ? 
  roc weiler likes fitness , so he does a ` get eve nerds into shape ' thing . 
  jester likes to write words and pvp , so he joined the csm so he can type a lot , and joined wrote kapelle because they also write words and pvp . 
  there 's also a lot guys who like programming and figure they 'd write programs and sites that interact with eve ( or dust ) . 
  oh , hey , maybe that 's an option ; pick up an old ps3 and play some dust . 
  the time commitment is a lot less , and you will still be connected with the eve universe . 
  i 've been trying out amarr faction warfare but oh boy the blue berries are so bad . 
  not sure what faction my corp will settle on . 
  you do know that it 's entirely up to other people to decide whether your ship is worth ganking right ? 
  there 's no magic line where 19.999 million isk is safe but 20 million is n't . 
  a rule of thumb would be 4 million isk per 1k of effective ehp , but err on the side of caution if you 're unsure . 
  that 's a big omission . 
  whiskey tengu foxtrot, 
  you can adjust the settings of which factions you will accept contracts from . 
  just select ` faction contracts ' in the battle finder and change the options . 
  a lot of autz corps are nullsec only and prefer you to be quite experienced , but there are a lot of strong pvp corps , like house of serenity . 
  there 's also quite a few that do faction warfare , which is pretty fun especially when the dust guys post their fight locations so you can rock up , orbit a satellite and blow shit up while gaining loyalty points . 
  oh , also join [ whirlpool ] ( http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2074535&amp;p=-1&amp;#bottom ), 
  lol half of au time zone is in syndicate it seems . 
  we 'd need to increase the processing speed too . 
  most people lodging asylum claims are legitimate , it just takes five years to process them , meanwhile they 're in a detention centre getting a mental illness instead of being out in the workforce earning money and paying taxes . 
   let 's do the math, 
   1 protosuit = 155 lp + 8,653 isk, 
   155 lp + 8,653 isk = 57,690 isk, 
   155 lp = 49,037 isk, 
   1 lp = 316.37 isk, 
   level 10 winning = 659 lp = 208,486 isk, 
   level 10 losing = 165 lp = 52,200 isk, 
  that 's pretty freaking low . 
  i got a fedo pile . 
  not hidden . 
  it 's awesome . 
  source : my kids . 
  he subtle humour that goes right over their heads keeps me amused , too . 
  the spandex was a dead give away . 
  that is a bet i would not take . 
  look at what happened in queensland . 
  newman gets in , gets a report from costello that fails basic auditing rules , proceeds to slash the budget . 
  server side or client side ? 
  all fw mat hes are like this for me , since we 're from different countries, 
  unlike / r/evenewbies where you wo n't get flamed , but also might not get a prompt answer . 
  mabrick has posted at least three times on various aspects of pi , i 'm sure you can find them . 
  i know some friendly people who are ruthless bastards at work . 
  i seem to recall him already having a go at opposition leader . 
  i look forward to you streaming that . 
  i bet they 'd get cheaper plans if they electronically tagged their employees ' ears , but that does n't make it acceptable . 
  depends on who they have as friends . 
  we 've had a few groups attempt to kick us out of our constellation . 
  in some cases like fatal ascension , we just went : wulfpax : for a while ; in others , we fought , and sometimes [ things escalated quickly ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/bar-fight-in-ef-f/ ) . 
  altruism and al3x were closely matched , so eventually they decided it was n't worth the losses . 
  fa clearly outmatched our numbers , so we just hung around bombing them and ambushing them when they were returning from roams after being savaged by rote kapelle . 
  or we just went to delve for a vacation or whatever . 
   signifying despair and/or fall from grace, 
  i read it as `` your standards will drop a lot when you 're horny . '', 
  i suppose he was phoning it in a bit , in the most recent sotg . 
  happy little dumplings on james is okay . 
  as a non-american , those numbers seem ridiculously low . 
  in australia , capital gains [ count as regular income ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_gains_tax_in_australia ) , although the tax is halved if you keep the asset for twelve months before selling it . 
  they 're just trying to head off the whining before it happens . 
  no wonder you guys are so annoyed , then . 
   i 'm not in the industry to be treated like crap . 
  i 'll only take so much before i 'll tell someone to get lost . 
  true , regardless of the industry . 
  jelly level : *** so ***, 
  unless you 're sniping , controller is way better . 
  tactical edition is now actually worth getting . 
  no surprises ... 
  deployment cancelled until wednesday . 
  welp . 
  it 's pretty nice . 
  for instance , on any subreddit , if someone mentions / u/purpletech , he 'll get a message about it . 
  that 's how a lot of bots work . 
  wear it as a poncho ? 
  earning 150k . 
  confirming i 'm rich enough not to need maternity welfare handouts , especially if more useful programs get cut to pay for it . 
  much , much less . 
  i could n't live off my bank account , but yeah , totally . 
  house . 
  paid off because of aforementioned income .
