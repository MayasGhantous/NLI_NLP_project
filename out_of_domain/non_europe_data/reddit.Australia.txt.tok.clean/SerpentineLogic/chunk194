  maybe you [ ate a lot of tofu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phytoestrogens#food_sources ) . 
  like duty free shops in hong kong . 
  hk has no sales tax duties * anyway * . 
  alternatively , an entire year is like , 100 bucks , which i have extended to about 3 years using plex . 
  as with anything in mice , not everything translates to people . 
  for instance , mice do n't have the selective pressure to avoid getting cancer for a couple decades before reproducing , so a lot of things that ` cure cancer in mice ' are already happening in humans . 
  ditto for aging-related processes . 
  still , this shows promise . 
  if 1 % of people have drugs , the police dogs will flag five people . 
  however , that also means the police let 95 people through , which saves a lot of time and effort by itself . 
  would n't they just be matchsticks with the head cut off ? 
  plot twist : pics are of mitt romney 's chest . 
  especially since they 're organic candles . 
  aqis often takes a dim view to stuff like that . 
  well , i 'm convinced by * both * you guys ' arguments . 
  stranger things have happened . 
  like that shoe box thing . 
  that was pretty strange , you have to admit . 
  also , at current prices the treatment costs $ 50k per day . 
  i. . . do n't know what that is . 
  citation needed . 
  it 's both . 
  wider seats equals fewer seats per flight , so the plane is n't as profitable . 
  heavier passengers equals more fuel used so the plane is even less profitable . 
  that did n't really support your argument so much as note how complicated the situation is . 
  extras are n't government-mandated - obviously they decided that the extra income from people going ` yay i 'll sign up for that ' outweighs the cost of payouts , especially when they can stiff their entire customer base with the additional fees . 
  are there any non-profit health insurance companies left in australia ? 
  i have honestly never considered doing this . 
  i consider myself to be rabidly fanboyish just having the [ apocrypha wallpaper ] ( http://www.eveonline.com/creations/wallpapers/apocrypha-blue-nebula/ ) . 
  i hope to god your username is not referring to who i think it is . 
  you 'll still need to login to send evemails or actually put new skills into training , but the first four [ here ] ( http://appcrawlr.com/app/ubergrid/868423 ) are probably what you want . 
  i hear good things about neocom , but who knows . 
  let 's get some christmas carols going !, 
  [ violent night ] ( https://soundcloud.com/sindel-pellion/violent-night-1 ), 
   violent night !, 
  deadly night !, 
   broadcast up , time to fight !, 
   round the fc , anchor up tight . 
   hero tackle trying to kite . 
   grief the heavens in fleets !, 
   violent night !, 
  deadly night !, 
   hostiles quake at the sight !, 
   apocs bridge from systems afar . 
   enemies warping to the star . 
   someone please get a perch !, 
   laser beams in your ugly face . 
   time you bitches learned your place . 
   in your clone bay reborn !, 
  and one that i 've been bugging / u/sindelpellion to sing :,

   i wan na rep up your damaged armor, 
   because i hate red damage bars, 
  [ warp speed implants ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/typesearch.html?search=speed+ws ) are pretty cheap . 
  i do n't see why it would n't . 
  then again , i 've been known to be wrong , which is why i still have 800 tech 1 industrial ships in my hangar . 
  sadly , yes . 
  such is the fate of terrible patch speculators . 
  a single-player/cooperative historical campaign would be, 
  * awesome , and, 
  * a first for ccp ( they 're not really known for scripted content ), 
  i made thirty or forty battleships then ran out of liquid isk . 
  medicare is n't a health insurance company . 
  i 'm not sure what your point was . 
  like shark fin , one eats whale not because it 's tasty , but because it 's a status symbol . 
  `` gate guns are my copilot '', 
  probably more like narcissistic personality disorder . 
  it 's a * government agency * , a totally different thing , so your answer makes no sense . 
  it 's like me asking `` what 's a good non-profit bank/credit union '' and you replying `` the accc is non-profit '' . 
  as an asian whose family has been in australia for 70 years longer than the hansons , she can fuck off back to her own country . 
  something something pot kettle black . 
  sorry , i ca n't hear you over all this karma i have . 
  [ nope , 20au/s ] ( http://pozniak.pl/database/index.php?id=10&amp;id2=1&amp;nr=33513 ) . 
  only has 1 calibration point , so even if it did have rig slots you could n't put anything on it . 
  i guess this means i should save up to buy medibank shares . 
  at least i 'll get a reacharound , then . 
  i 'd be that happy for 99.999 b, 
  sadly , she did n't follow through . 
  gallente scout bonus is pretty neat for sneaking up on people without alerting them that they 're on scan . 
  with range amplification v and gallente scout v :, 
  * basic light frame : 24m, 
  * scout g-1 : 36m - almost to the edge of assault rifle optimal range . 
  add a single range extender and you 're up to a ridiculous 52m passive scan , which makes hunting in built-up areas quite easy . 
  you get the earnings at downtime iirc . 
  i get this occasionally since 1.7 ( at least it 's better than the time when i 'd get a fatal error * entering * a game ), 
  you might have luck by letting the end-of-game screen time out and drop you back in the mq , or be in a game and get idle-kicked - that may fix it . 
  alternatively , power cycle your ps3 might help . 
  i do n't know , sorry :-(, 
  it 's more like a ` my state is worse than yours ' competition ** and we 're winning ** .
