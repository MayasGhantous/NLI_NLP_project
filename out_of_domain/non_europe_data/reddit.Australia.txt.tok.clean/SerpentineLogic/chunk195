  university politics is like a man who has read three books and considers himself an expert . 
  it 's a seductive echo chamber of circle jerkery . 
  there certainly were far-right groups at uq . 
  mostly , though , it does n't matter whether it 's centre-left or centre-right if all they learn is dirty tricks . 
  much value, 
  wow, 
  medicare runs the entire public healthcare system , medibank private et al offer private healthcare . 
  it 's really not the same . 
  just the links themselves . 
  routes do use up m ^ 3 of the link though . 
  percent skills multiply . 
  the falcon never has days off . 
  southern legion here . 
  you guys are pretty cool and give good fights with no drama . 
  i bet your leadership does n't have elite powerpoint presentation skills like ours does though . 
  oh , it 's * on * now . 
  like , you send the pictures to people then blackmail them for having it ? 
  i 'm not sure how blackmail * would * work against mynnna , who clearly has no sense of shame to begin with . 
  i 'm willing to accept that . 
  do you have to manually redeem it or what ? 
  how do i know i got the quafe suit ? 
  meh , australia manages to allocate public funds to political parties . 
  it 's not rocket surgery . 
  as much as anything in rl would : probably only in a small way , but there 's a chance of things escalating . 
  wilsons syndrome . 
  after weighing up the options , the raaf suited me best , but not enough to actually go to adfa , even with a scholarship . 
  not since [ two years ago ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/freighter-pilot-implants/ ) . 
  you could probably work it out from the numbers in that post . 
  they send the officers to fight while the enlisted stay on the ground . 
  sounds like they have their heads screwed on right . 
  yeah , it means warp speed makes a lot more difference now , so the ascendency implants are probably better than nomads even without crunching the numbers . 
  come to think of it , with advancements in drones , maybe * everyone * will stay on the ground ... 
  are you offering ? 
  but that 's the way to bet . 
  consider [ moving internationally ] ( http://www.immi.gov.au/visas/pages/476.aspx ) . 
  why do you have so few restocks ? 
  perhaps i 'm a bit strange , but i like to have triple figures of my favourite fits . 
  from [ tagn ] ( http://evepics.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/know-your-baltec/ ) . 
  * at all, 
  it 's pretty easy to integrate with eve via yaem . 
  the cpm has given hints that 1.8 is an infantry shake up . 
  my wife is on the committee of our child care centre . 
  she has saved a few thousand dollars by making improvements but there 's only so much you can do . 
  but legitimately forcing someone to go suspect then ransom their shiny mission ship is okay right ? 
  yeah , trim arks without a plate is probably not worth it . 
  from bread basket of africa to basket case of africa . 
  5 % bonus to zoom per level ? 
  pakkonen has zero wait times . 
  you pay extra , but you * still get * medicare . 
  it 's not the numbers , it 's the percentage that matters . 
  with 300 million people vs 22 , there 's a good chance that they would have visited those expert doctors regardless of what the us system was . 
  there 's just more room for specialisation in larger countries . 
  really ? 
  especially do n't go if you know you will be breaking the law ... 
  \\* holds up ten fingers \\*, 
  two . 
  not more than two . 
  i think you 'll find that asian babies * are * statistically smaller than western babies , even when the parents eat western diets . 
  why not fit a micro jump drive ? 
  yeah ; i saw a picture of an armour-plated bulldozer from png . 
  apparently the locals are proactive in showing their displeasure if your company is building a road they do n't like . 
  there are many stories about the various branches of special forces in commonwealth nations ; the national sas outfits , gurkhas etc. 
  an apocryphal story i 've heard told is :, 
  one training exercise involved sneaking up on other nations and using a blowpipe to put red paintballs on them , but you could only do it when the target was alone . 
  when it was the gurkha 's turn , all the other nations were pretty chuffed at parade because nobody had any red on their uniforms . 
  the indian co just said `` everyone check the sole of their right boot '' . 
  sure enough , everyone had been tagged . 
  17/0 in a 85k tank with 150k sp in vehicles . 
  work choices was a big factor though . 
  i have this bravery award , but i do n't know who to give it to ; the op or poe . 
  or use / u/snapshot _ bot or something ... 
  yes . 
  tldr needs more [ agency ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/the-eve-dust-link-a-question-of-agency/ ) . 
  make all the snide comments you like , as long as you start with `` i agree it sucks ... '', 
  not a sock , does n't count . 
  the same thing for both groups - people inside the group need to call out other members who have crossed the line into inappropriate behaviour . 
  still , shooting people is not okay . 
  probably not sociopathic , likely borderline personality disorder . 
  either way , stay clear . 
  was n't srs started by people from something awful ? 
  trans-pacific partnership agreement ? 
  so , mittani not really being played at all , then . 
  where 's the kill mails, 
  pedestrians happen . 
  something something blue intel . 
  i do n't think he 's a bot . 
  i went to low sec as soon as i realised how long it would take me to get standings for level three missions . 
  sounds like undiagnosed borderline personality disorder ... 
  why not use the fighter assist mechanism ? 
  sounds like a good going away party though . 
  no , the game mechanics behind it . 
  assigned fighters use up the recipients drone limit , so you can only assign five fighters to someone , no matter how many carriers you have . 
  evetimecode.com often has discount codes floating around . 
  you could tell that just from his letter ? 
  you can do pi on half a million sp . 
  so abolish negative gearing for new loans , except for newly built houses . 
  is it the same fei as fei sik ( brown ) ? 
  never not stop not eating .
