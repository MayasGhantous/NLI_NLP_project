  advanced g scout has two high slots for some reason .

  personally , i think his unreliability is good because you have to think for yourself whether he 's having a derp moment or not . 
  i do , however , like john quiggin and joshua gans more . 
  drone assist is a hell of a drug .

  means that, 
  * the people who find them probably do n't want them , so buy orders will be filled, 
  * people who want them probably ca n't go out and get them , so sell orders will be filled, 
  * consumed by industry , so there 's a constant ( if low ) demand that wo n't get recycled into the economy by looting of wrecks, 
  * constrained supply , so people ca n't just build a bunch and flood the market, 
  brisbane has  1 million people , not counting the other million in ~ ~ the projects ~ ~ logan city , i 'm sure there will be enough night life for you . 
  thanks for the warning .

  have you done the career agent mission arcs ? 
  x3 is a bit like a single person eve .

  `` power corrupts , so i 'm taking all of it to protect the rest of russia from its evil '' .

  cba was a bit painful ( one of the advantages of a state-owned business is that it shows up profiteering by everyone else ) , but at the end of the day , switching banks is pretty easy , and since you can use any bank 's atms , it 's not a natural monopoly .
