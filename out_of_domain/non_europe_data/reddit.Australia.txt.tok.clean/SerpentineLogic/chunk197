  they 're standard definitions . 
  i think it 's sad that the hippy generation have turned into such absolute bastards . 
  test tube please ignore, 
  discounting inflation , yes . 
  the missing profit is called a [ structural deficit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_and_cyclical_deficit#structural_deficit ) , as opposed to a cyclical deficit i.e. 
  ` we 're in a recession , * of course * unemployment welfare costs are higher and tax revenues are lower ' . 
  i checked some of the companies i 've worked for . 
  yep , pretty accurate . 
  looks like ccp , at times , has a very strong ` not invented here ' streak . 
  hipfire spread on rails is absurdly low ; a legacy of the breach assault rifle . 
  this is * exactly * the reason tars were op ; good up close as well as good at range .

  we have [ bounty bags ] ( http://www.bountybags.com.au/ ) in australia , too . 
  they 're free , but not government-issued ; they 're sponsored by various baby-related companies , who each chip in money and free stuff as advertising . 
  what 's wrong with paying 30 % income tax ? 
  last year , i paid, 
  \\* calculates \\*, 
  an average of 30.46 % of my income in tax , and consider it good value for what i received ( i.e. 
  my awesome society ), 
  * if only * taxes scaled based on population as well ... 
  can you find a high resolution screen shot and run it through a filter that emulates colour blindness ? 
  post it on the forums and see what they think . 
  where the hell are they going to buy stuff in a hospital ? 
  looking at the headlines , the private sector is n't fit , either . 
  it 's an unpleasant thought , but i reckon you guys have a corruption problem . 
  wow that 's corrupted . 
  what was your point ? 
  not a good idea to quit during a global recession ... 
  or just send some drones to kill the smaller stuff , 
  my top marginal tax rate is 37 % , which kicks in for every dollar earned over 80k . 
  however , there are far less other taxes than in the us . 
  fair enough . 
  our fuel tax is only 25 % . 
  that makes sense , since labor has both right-wing and a left-wing factions . 
  solution : do n't have any money to start with . 
  is that some sort of snipe ratting fit ? 
  use it to buy plex on amazon ? 
  definitely give it a try . 
  oh , yeah , forgot . 
  a rule of thumb is if you ca n't replace a ship at least twice , you ca n't afford to lose it . 
  that is marketing bullshit , not a server status message . 
  grr, 
  [ sauce ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=134173 ), 
  am displeased that caldari suits get resistance bonuses to amarr weapons , since they 're allied with amarr . 
  should be resistances to gallente and minmatar weapons instead . 
  fansites , charities , app developers , guys selling forum signatures for isk , gambling sites that pull in 100k usd per year ; their concept of ' 3rd parties ' is a fucking big umbrella . 
  also , [ assault suit bonuses ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=1692982#post1692982 ), 
  [ they are ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/06/bridget-clinch-sexchange-_n_792435.html ) . 
  i message leboe and tell him to make some for me . 
  i can get behind that . 
  i just use drk industry planner for that . 
  once you manufacture , research or copy from a blueprint , it will extract the me and pe for later use . 
  that 's handy , because i really do n't want to manually input 1200 bpos into a spreadsheet . 
  if they 're corporate blueprints yes . 
  specifically this guy 's guides :,

  feel free to apply to his industrial corp. 
  silicone implants make you lose sp when they pop , though . 
  on a serious note , small and medium turret-specific implants are good value because they 're narrow in scope ( low demand ) and are n't in demand from mission runners . 
  only minmatar scouts need apply . 
  perhaps they will be putting [ bolognese mittani ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/bolognese-mittani/ ) on the menu ? 
  if you are exceptionally lucky , a support request might reverse the standings loss . 
  did n't they already have that ? 
  not sure - it might be possible to shoot while cloaked , but it might take a chunk of time off your cloak duration . 
  just trade in small stuff like repair paste . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.blackpalette.com/site/ ), 
  it takes a bold person not to put money in * that * hat , surrounded by large men with easy access to suddenly-broken beer glasses . 
  maybe , but that 's not how it reads . 
  i like it . 
  third party devs come up with great ideas for fitting tools , then , later , ccp takes some of the best ideas and puts them into the game client for everyone to access . 
  now you 're just currying favour . 
  so , if one scout knifes another scout , they 'll get both rewards . 
  i can handle that . 
  the writing style of the last chapter in particular is much plainer than book six and most of book seven . 
  many planetary conquest corps pay their members millions of isk to participate in battles vov, 
   why is n't australia offering tax incentives that are as competitive as those offered by the uk ? 
  we spent all the money on cars and films . 
  let 's hope they 're as vigilant about whooping cough cases . 
  what time to you play in ? 
  and then everyone loses . 
  to your kid not dying of a preventable disease ? 
  yeah i can see how that would be a terrible event . 
  i hear some bonuses have changed on their internal server since then . 
  til my friend wang has been touched by god . 
  in fact , wangs being touched by god is apparently fairly common at certain schools . 
  no , the child does n't deserve it . 
  however , the parents certainly do deserve to live with the guilt . 
  epidemiologists have determined that the thing that correlates the most with unvaccinated children is parents with phds . 
  after all , when you think you 're smarter than 90 % of the population in one narrow field , it 's a small step to thinking you know better in any other field , including medicine . 
  some of my cousins got whooping cough ; it knocked them around pretty badly . 
  so when my kids were born , we stipulated that anyone who wanted to visit the babies needed an up-to-date whooping cough vaccine , at least until the kids were immunised . 
  a few of my relatives balked , but i just told them `` i guess i 'll see you in six months . '', 
  knives should get backstab bonuses , not headshot bonuses imo . 
  at the very least , your wrecks will provide warp-ins . 
  if ccp consulted the cpm , why would there be a need for this petition ? 
  at this stage , communication with some trams is so bad that nobody from the cpm wants to do it next year . 
  google fails me , sorry :-(, 
  like slavery in the united states ? 
  culture changes . 
  what makes you believe they are scrambled when in bastion mode ?
