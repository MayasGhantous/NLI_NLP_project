  maybe your economists are less careful and more impetuous in their approach . 
  policy measures like minimum wages , mandatory health insurance and competition laws are a drag upon an economy , but also stop it being such a terrible place when times are tough . 
  the australian economy did n't really benefit from the us financial boom in the mid-2000s , but the global financial crisis * also * did n't affect it much . 
  it 's a valid economic strategy . 
  pretty awesome , thanks . 
  australian dollar is stronger than the usd , employment is right about where we want it , interest rates are historically on the low side , and our government is trying for a surplus , which is a bit retarded and unlikely to happen , but is n't so bad in the larger scheme of things . 
  oh we 're definitely blue state material . 
  we 're what most countries would call ` moderates ' , and the usa would call ` left-wing extremists ' . 
  regrettably , this is probably true the world over . 
  most australians do n't tip * precisely * because the minimum wage is high enough . 
  you call that stuff * food * ? 
  ca n't post , busy being smug . 
  income tax is higher , but other taxes are lower . 
  and yes , quality of life is quite decent . 
  come over for a working holiday and check it out . 
  mining towns have expensive houses in a mining boom . 
  we pay slightly less tuition , but get less grants and other income . 
  it 's not ideal , but we * did * just have eleven years of right-wing government so cuts were made during that time . 
  in broad terms , it 's more similar to the canadian system than to the us system . 
  wait , what ? 
  til australia is an even luckier country than i thought . 
  my wife would * figuratively * kill you . 
  you win , because a degree from an australian university is evidently worth moving overseas to acquire , or else nobody would bother doing it . 
  the australian tertiary education system wins , because you subsidise the other students , or provide the funding to expand the capacity to teach more students . 
  i think the immigration/visa issues are more of a pain than the financial ones , for most international students . 
  on the balance of probability , no . 
  for the time being !, 
  it is quite pleasant . 
  a grain of truth in the sandpit of your hyperbole . 
  if ccp knew how to market properly , they 'd give out [ rewards ] ( http://au.riftgame.com/en/game/veteran-rewards.php ) for longer subs . 
  would love some snowballs , tbh . 
  i like the [ ship spinning counter ] ( http://throughnewbeyes.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/shipspinning1.jpg ) . 
  t2 stuff :, 
  * gang links ( +10 % cpu , +5 % grid need , 25 % more boost ), 
  * mapc ( 12 grid , less cpu use ( 18 ) than meta 4 ), 
  * probe launchers ( +5 % bonus for ~ 10 % more cpu ), 
  * siege modules ( +10 % cpu , +5 % grid but 840 % damage mod and max 3 locked targets ), 
  * triage modules ( more locked targets , more targeting range and more scan res ), 
  * warp disruption field generator ( more range , 19.2 km base -- meaning 24km with hic v or 36km with a focused script ), 
  * remote hull reps ( whatever ), 
  * drone link augmenter ( 20 % more range ), 
  * drone nav computer ( 30 % instead of 25 % ), 
  * omnidirectional tracking link ( 25 % instead of 20 % ), 
  * bomb launchers ( 15 % faster reload ), 
  * tractor beams ( 20 % more range , 20 % faster speed boo yah ), 
  there are more people playing eve online than live in iceland , the country it was developed in . 
  that 's because of tengu . 
  step 1 : go on normal backpacking vacation to australia . 
  step 2 : pick up itinerant jobs like fruit picking or bartending to pay your way, 
  step 3 : decide whether you really want to stay . 
  at least you 'll have a better idea of how to approach full-time employment ( as a social worker , or whatever ), 
  we have much more cost-effective health care and do n't have a gigantic military , so our taxes , when you factor in sales , ( lack of ) local , ( lack of ) state and federal taxes , are vaguely comparable . 
  by * far * the majority of the tax we pay comes from, 
  * 10 % goods and services tax ( excluding rent , basic food ), 
  * [ federal income tax ] ( http://www.taxcalc.com.au/ ), 
  lots . 
  minimum wage [ scales up ] ( http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx ) from $ 5.71 for teens , up to full at 21 years . 
  never sell your main . 
  well , there 's already the [ matchariel ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=25143 ) , the [ papercraft ships ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/pupumonkey/ ) , and the [ pod ] ( http://guindel.deviantart.com/art/pod-193905534 ) , so perhaps choose something different to those ? 
  i am australian . 
  the job market is fairly strong ; retail is weak due to the aud being high against international currencies , but mining is incredibly strong ( we 're talking about 140,000 + dollar salaries for train drivers ) . 
  imagine a country that did n't notice the global financial crisis , and bias your outlook that way . 
  as far as life in general goes , living costs are higher , but health care coverage costs are [ miniscule ] ( http://www.medibank.com.au/healthcover/insurance/hospital-range/ ) and taxes are mostly from income tax rather than being nickle and dimed as you spend it . 
  in summary , australia is a lot like the usa but with the really incredible and really terrible bits sanded off . 
  run incursions in a pvp-fit ship . 
  pi is n't a bad way ; when i work at it , i can make a few hundred million a month , [ even in high-sec ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) . 
  if you 're actually extracting stuff , then it 's less profitable , but your outlay is practically zero so it 's all up-side . 
  when i was doing pi extracting , i 'd run with four planets extracting to p1 , and a fifth planet turning the four p1s into a p3 . 
  your mileage may vary , however . 
  in short , pi is a constant , low level of income for low effort that will pay for a couple of battlecruisers per month . 
  where do you work ? 
  $ 100/hr consistent contract rate seems quite impressive . 
  we have more ex-criminals tho . 
  a recent study indicated that , past $ 70k per year , money does n't buy much happiness . 
  anecdotally , i think that wherever your ` cashflow positive ' income level is , once you reach it , you get a huge weight off your mind . 
  sure , it may take a year or 18 months to buy that new tv , but you know that you will eventually afford it . 
  below that amount , money definitely , * directly * buys more happiness . 
  if you have a trade , and especially if you 're younger than 30 , it 's very easy . 
  be prepared to work at a mining town for a few years to get a nest egg , but in return , they 'll pay you a truly * ridiculous * amount of money . 
  guess they wo n't be retiring at 40 like you will , then . 
  norway affords its awesome lifestyle because it invested its oil money . 
  australia is only now starting to tax mining profits to do the same . 
  we 'll catch up everntually . 
  ofc you * must * cook roo well-done if it 's not farmed roo . 
  last roo i shot , i only ate the ( rear ) legs and tail . 
  yes : when you lose connection , or attempt a logoffski , you will warp 1 * meeeellion * km away in a random direction , then logoff after a minute or fifteen minutes , depending on whether you have aggression or not . 
  the number of times i lost connection as a noob and logged in just to see the last of my warrior iis being popped by rats ... * sigh * as a new player , losing a full set of t2 drones is a non-trivial expense . 
  remember , faction invulns are also * a lot * better than t2 invulns . 
  just saiyan . 
  in eanm is 12.5 % better than eanm ii . 
  cn invuln is ** 25 % better ** than invuln ii . 
  if the tag/lp cost is dropped , expect their resists to to be nerfed as well . 
  to be fair , they also want it pushed out to sisi this month , and adding extra settings might have made it uncertain whether it would be ready in time . 
  roo is fairly gamey , a bit like venison , rather than veal or camel . 
  but then he 'd be * less rich * . 
  if the drones can get back before yiu finish aligning , then yes . 
  for sentries 20km away , thats not gon na happen . 
  you do know that the alliance that controls axdx is doomed to fail cascade , right ? 
  also , bugger being 6 cynos from empire ... 
  not the first poetic-justice-laden hit .
