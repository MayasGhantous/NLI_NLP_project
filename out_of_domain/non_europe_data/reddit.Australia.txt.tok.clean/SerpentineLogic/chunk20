  in fact , any time you see a market order with 364 days expiry , that 's an npc sell order . 
  according to a recent study , yes . 
  that 's what makes it so weird . 
  brand name medicine may cost the pbs more , though , which means more pressure for higher taxes . 
  i looked at the price of +5 s vs +4 s , and the likelyhood of me being popped in them ( i do fly in lowsec so i should be safe , but sometimes smartbombs happen ) , and figured i 'd roll with two +4 s and spend the isk i saved on plex instead . 
  if only there was a way to view videos over the internet . 
  this was during the incarna sh!tstorm and i did n't feel like paying actual money to play a possibly-dying game . 
  so , i bought a half-dozen plex and coasted through until ccp stopped going full retard . 
  oops !,

  [ ... ] `` holding '' sov requires active defense with gangs and patrols , not just passive tcus that prevent people from docking .

  if you want to own a system and prevent others from using it , you should be obligated to defend it .

  a guy on en24 admitted he ran 80 bots , and used rmt to pay for the deposit on a * house * . 
  80 bots . 
  that 's a titan per day .

  you evidently never saw the torrent of isk he pumped into imperial 0rder with his alt .

  give some attention to all the guys who do stuff to make everyone 's life in eve easier .

  from the [ blog post ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/snapcount.html ) :, 
   * notice : the following post , and all of its supporting data , were written and generated without assistance of any kind from any current or former ccp employees or management . 
   last summer , i made a bit of a name for myself with a pair of posts that looked at data focusing on how many people are logged into eve online at any given time . 
  i called the posts '' [ not all curves are pretty ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/07/not-all-curves-are-pretty.html ) '' and '' [ some curves are n't ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/08/some-curves-arent.html ) '' . 
  and aside from my various player guides , the second post is the most-read thing i 've ever written on this blog . 
  the two posts were statistical analyses of eve 's logged-in player counts over a period of about five years . 
  i looked at eve log-in data primarily because that 's the data that 's most interesting to me . 
  while other mmos concentrate on subscription numbers , eve 's `` content '' is really primarily the players . 
  the more people playing eve , the better the game is and the richer the experience is . 
   so while the number of eve subscribers is important , to my way of thinking , the number of people logged in is more important . 
   it 's my understanding that `` curves '' created quite a stir within ccp . 
  certainly , it probably represented the first example of an eve player taking ccp business data , normalizing and collating it using modern techniques , and producing an analysis freely available to the player base . 
  the data for the first post was provided from publicly-available pcu data . 
  the data for the second post was provided to me by a pair of anonymous sources ; since their data matched both each other and the previously publicly available data , i ran with it . 
   the center-piece of the second `` curves '' post was this chart :, 
   [ http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2011/eve-players-2011.png] ( http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2011/eve-players-2011.png ), 
   it showed a massive decrease in logged-in players following the release of incursion and a completely stagnant log-in curve after the release of incarna . 
  as a result , it provided both players and csm6 with a lot of political capital to show ccp conclusive proof that from a business stand-point , incarna was not succeeding in its stated goals . 
   ccp was apparently surprised and unhappy to be dictated to in this manner . 
  at the end of `` curves '' , i promised that as long as i was provided relevant data , i would keep the players abreast of any changes in these numbers . 
  but i also made it clear that i was dependent on the data . 
  i guess i should n't have been surprised when the data flow dried up . 
  the public data source i 'd used for the first post itself went off-line , and i did n't hear from my two sources again . 
  between this and fearless , ccp became rather manic about plugging `` leaks '' of information . 
  whether this mania contributed to the death of the qens around the same time , i ca n't say . 
   and for months , the data that i needed to generate an update for `` curves '' was unavailable to me . 
  it left me with a bit of a problem : if i wanted to continue tracking this curve , how could i do it ? 
   i 'm happy to report that i 've found a way . 
  this time , i 'm keeping the `` how '' to myself to hopefully prevent my data being shut off . 
  but you can rest assured that the data source is publicly available , and i now have the capability to independently pull that data and generate analyses of eve logged-in player counts whenever i care to . 
  the core of my ability to do this is a pair of self-written computer programs that i collectively call `` snapcount '' , after an american football term . 
  a week ago , every element of snapcount ran successfully for the first time , producing its first report . 
  i linked the new data to my previous data , and here we are . 
   now that i have a good source for this data , i 'm keen to do some other analyses as well . 
  for instance , i have a hunch that the so-called `` summer slump '' is a myth and i 'll be interested to see if the data bears this hunch out . 
  watch this space . 
   in the meantime , this post represents the long-promised update to `` curves '' . 
  let 's start with the full-year 2011 chart , the update to the chart above :, 
   [ http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/eve-players-2011.png] ( http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/eve-players-2011.png ), 
   as you can see , after the end of the previous chart -- the data for which ended on 22 august -- things did not improve in terms of numbers of players logged into the game . 
  21 august was a sunday , traditionally the busiest day in the eve week , and represented a good number of players logged into the game . 
  28 august saw this number drop by about 5 % . 
  it continued dropping all through the remainder of the summer into autumn . 
  by mid-october , the decline was almost 10 % total . 
  this almost certainly represents player unsubs . 
  the 30-day delay after the jita riots of mid-july reflects that a large portion of these unsubs were likely players using gtcs or plexes to fund their play . 
   by october , the green 90-day rolling average line is essentially in free-fall , finally leveling off in a new normal of about 27,500 players logged in average , per day . 
   in the first post last july , i included a chart that displayed the relative success of each eve expansion based on the number of players +30 days after the expansion was released , +60 days after the expansion was released , and a week prior to the release of the next expansion , a date i called '' + next '' . 
  i can now fill this table in and include the incarna numbers .
