  just use emp ? 
  ps if you do n't like words you 're probably in the wrong place . 
  yes , you need t2 skills to make t2 stuff . 
  personally i think it 's a bit stupid ; imo science skills and manufacturing skills should be separate so people can specialise . 
  that thing which you fight you become . 
  50k * very * odd blues . 
  wait is n't there already / r/gwaustralia ? 
  edit : oh , full of sausages :(, 
  welp, 
  much better than mike 's last few . 
  i say go for it . 
  ours is forty pages , although thirty of them are full of ascii art of penises . 
  does it count if it 's corp owned ? 
  aideron robotics has an app that does this . 
  i can neither confirm nor deny . 
  * tourist sees a farmer holding a sheep *, 
  `` do you shear ? '', 
  `` no , git yer ewn sheep . '', 
  [ numbers do n't lie ] ( http://eve-fail.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/reporting-interval-financial-report.html ) . 
  he can plex his account for the next forty years vov, 
  less than you 'd think , especially if you concentrate on being useful at research before starting on manufacturing skills . 
  it 's mostly about getting the capital for the blueprints , which is why most new players join an industrial corporation and use their blueprint library . 
  unless he 's playing dust , where he 's a fiend with a sniper rifle . 
  i would be okay with a 24-hour queue , even if it only used one line . 
  thorium l invents into null l. 
  another way of thinking about it : do it through the contracts system . 
  * `` wtb these pi components , delivered to my poco '', 
  * `` here 's a corp manufacturing job with all the components in the right hangar division , and outputting to this other hangar for 1 million isk reward . 
  everything is set up just press accept and find choose a production line , okay ? '', 
  i would pay money to avoid effort . 
  i mean , that 's the entire business model of hauling companies . 
  you can get a cheap t2 bpo for 4 or 5b , you know . 
  a few suits have innate armour regeneration ... 
  kbm support is pretty ordinary in dust now . 
  chromosome patch was much nicer . 
  i 'd even be okay with refunding specialised skills but keeping the basic frame skills . 
  blue donut becomes filled with blueberry jam . 
  no big surprise . 
  two of my corp mates are brothers . 
  one drives a light vehicle and runs logistics repairs while his brother is a heavy . 
  it 's a sight to behold watching them drive up to a building , jump out and clear it together . 
  perhaps you can do something similar ? 
  if you get an opportunity to squad up with some pros , you take it :-p, 
  cfc knows how to deal with high lag situations . 
  they just chose to disregard past experience this time , and paid the price . 
  in fact , a more cynical eye would suspect they did it deliberately to make some sort of point about lag due to drones . 
  last night i put one point into hmg and one point into amarr heavy . 
  best fun i 've had in weeks . 
  passive skill points accrue at 24k per day , that adds up over the ~ 12 months since dust went open beta . 
  phew , was worried they 'd switch to sony 's 3d head set because bags of money . 
  so what was the opinion of other people there ? 
  set up a tower or two and get there the day before . 
  log on at downtime if necessary . 
  even then . 
  undock , jump to a cyno . 
  mistakes were made . 
  it 's basically only for my comments . 
  it 's okay to admit that . 
  so , i can bug you even when i 'm not in \\ #dust 514 ? 
  how incredibly convenient . 
  five hundred extra local spammers in every trade hub . 
  : pokerface :, 
  space changes . 
  people do n't . 
  should be half standings loss then .

  step one is to be the guy who made and handed out bdci coins ...

  you know what else will clear grids and reduce load on the servers ? 
  disconnecting all the players . 
  does n't mean * it 's * a good idea , either . 
  n3 wanted to take hed from aaa because reasons . 
  aaa is part of/friends of the black russian coalition . 
  russians batphoned cfc to help . 
  n3 got ready in the system ahead of time . 
  cfc did n't or could n't . 
  when the timer expired , cfc bridged in ships in the wrong order in risky ways and lost a few hundred billion isk worth of dreadnoughts . 
  they were probably all insured so they have that going for them . 
  the scientists i know would claim anything if there were the prospect of a beer . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice subreddits . 
  i like to think of it as `` higher minimum wage : painful to both parties '' . 
  i thought they came free with every packet of fruit roll-ups ? 
  i 'll hold you to that , bill . 
  https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/ may help you choose which corporation to run missions for ( remember that amarr pirate npcs will probably carve through your shields in a distressing manner ), 
  exploration sites ( or combat sites found only via scanning ), 
  you do not talk back to ace of clubs . 
  by the numbers , an amarr scout with infinite stamina would still be weak . 
  had pizza hut in the ' 80 's . 
  a family-size pizza was $ 24 . 
  that 's 36 tuckshop pies , i.e. 
  about $ 130 bucks these days . 
  no wonder we did n't go to pizza hut often . 
  my mum lost a fifty dollar note once , when i was a kid . 
  i think it 's 28 spots via auction , 3 wildcards , 1 winner of last year . 
  why do n't you go to the [ party at the top of the world ] ( http://fanfest.eveonline.com/en/events/party ) and find out ? 
  overheat stuff , refit them . 
  modules are cheap when there 's carriers nearby . 
  it 's correct . 
  i remember prices dropping like a rock as soon as another pizza place opened in our town .
