  that should be fine , you should fit the whole seven guns on it though .

  evanova, 
  i bet it 's more than you 've done . 
  do you have a point to make ? 
  besides run red vs blue and enable game content for over 3500 characters ? 
  besides running weekly gank nights for even unaligned players to get into a large fleet and explode gloriously , which have turned into [ eve 's largest ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/community-spotlight-red-vs-blue/ ) regularly-scheduled pub roams ? 
  i do n't know .

  a lot of scandinavian countries give very high unemployment benefits but only for a year or two . 
  maybe aryth happened . 
  not a lot better , but still . . 
  we dropped some siphons . 
  goons reinforced every towers of ours they could find then got dropped by ninja unicorns . 
  so yeah , it 's generated a lot of content for us , to our chagrin .

  not biting until sarmatiko confirms it . 
  ccp devs hang out on \\ #dust 514 as well . 
  in a welcome turn of events , the shanghai devs are usually awake at the same time as me , which i appreciate . 
  ccp gives out free jagerbombs and lets the chips fall where they may . 
  so , you ca n't do much about land area , but perhaps you can do something about that other thing . 
  the whole ` high local taxes , low national taxes ' thing is an interesting idea . 
  it 's a bit shorter if you put the series down when it stops being good and starts being meh .

  judging by the bug reports , it 's a strong crash booster . 
  also , ender 's game was released in 2013 ; literally nobody wants the dvd version . 
  i saw ender 's game in the cinema in december vov . 
  google for eve mentat, 
  install it, 
  there is no step 3 . 
  a better idea would be to have markers on your controls so they could be detected and modeled correctly by the rift . 
  i believe the people over at / r/oculus are way ahead of you . 
  wolfenstein really-really-3d, 
  if it does n't happen , you can probably ask if someone on / r/oculus is willing to give you a demo .

  yes you can , but not automatically - your eve character gives the eve isk to another eve character , and the player 's dust character gives a certain amount of dust isk to your dust alt . 
  i just used it to transfer a heap of dust isk into 1.8 b eve isk . 
  it 's roughly 5 eve isk [ for 1 dust ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=111070 ) isk . 
  it 's worked for me . 
  alternatively , you can buy a dust code for eve isk while covered by the scam protection that ccp enforces on dust codes transferred on the forums , then sell the dust code for dust isk , again covered by scam protection . 
  someone bought a dust templar code from me in exchange for eve isk just a few days ago . 
  if you 're gate camping , even blue falcons are primary .

  not really , although there was a decent spike in new players this week . 
  dust and eve are linked in low-security space in faction warfare , which is not close to where the battle for b-r went down , and generally does n't involve the same alliances and coalitions . 
  dust is also linked in the molden heath region , which is a single location , again far away from b-r . 
  there are plans to increase dust 's influence in eve and vice versa , but there 's a tradeoff between boosting the key selling point of eve , the eve-dust link , and enhancing the core gameplay of dust i.e. 
  make it not so terrible . 
  dust battles have been flaky since downtime - raise a support ticket in eve and see what 's going on .

  for a while there , meta item drop rates were a bit screwed up . 
  a lot of players eschew the whole grinding aspect of eve , and will crack open a game time card and sell the plex on the market . 
  30 days of playing time can net you almost 650m isk ; enough to buy a lot of ships . 
  yes , but you really should put your hat in the ring now . 
  i 'm not sure why you 'd put anything into euros with the club med countries still dragging the entire eu down .
