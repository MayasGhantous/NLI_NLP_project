  it feels like the entire commonwealth has taken a hard right turn this election cycle . 
  choose a ship , click for the 3d view . 
  alternatively , you can view a prettier page here : http://www.eveonline.com/universe/spaceships/, 
  but it only has a small selection of all eve ships . 
  perhaps they need an injection of new blood ... 
  if you are willing to subscribe for multiple months , instead of buying plex , then there are [ year-round discounts ] ( http://www.eveonline.com/faq/paying-for-eve ) . 
  generally , plex sales are best used by players wanting to sell on the eve markets for extra isk - if you need game time , a subscription is much cheaper . 
   would you be able to buy influence with players , with corps , etc ? 
  a_puppetmaster 's antics suggest that you can buy a lot of influence with a fat wallet ; enough to let alliances rise and make them fall . 
  as [ gevlon ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/ ) illustrated , you can replace a hefty chunk of alliance income by a single market trader with asp - er , singleminded focus on making money . 
   are there any elements of the game where you can make an impact or influence in any way with huge wealth ? 
  progress ... 
  what is it ? 
  out here , [ progress is numbers . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ked11agobuk ), 
   are there any players who are famous for wealth ? 
  how are they famous ? 
  etc , etc. 
  well , there 's that eastern bloc guy whose dad is an aluminium tycoon who dropped a large sum of money on plex to finance his alliance . 
  however , for pure eve-based wealth accumulation , there 's aryth , mynnna et al from the goonswarm economic cabal , akita t , king of technetium , and a bunch of quasi-famous people in [ md ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&amp;f=253 ) . 
  it 's okay money for a low amount of efford , but other , higher-risk antics like running missions or suppressing incursions , or higher-effort activities like exploration and hacking are much better income per hour spent . 
  having said that , i sometimes undock a procurer and sit on an asteroid while playing other games , which you ca n't really do with other activities . 
  yeah . 
  there comes a point where your mining character is basically finished ; any more sp you put into them is pretty-much wasted . 
  that 's when it 's time to start a combat character . 
  tbh manufacturing is probably still best done in k-space - you have supply-chain issues , plus there 's always a station with open manufacturing slots that you do n't have to pay fuel costs for . 
  best to do some invention jobs then contract the bpcs to your manufacturing alt after dumping them in a station accessible through your static . 
  one thing that c1s are quite good for , though , is the t2 reaction chain . 
  you can either run a decent reaction chain in your c1 , or do alchemy to exploit price spikes . 
  either way , it 's pretty safe . 
  even your posting annoys me . 
  qut used to be called the queensland institute of technology . 
  i can understand the confusion . 
  basically , you fly up to another ship and activate modules that fit in a high slot ( i.e. 
  instead of guns ) . 
  these modules bathe the target in a soothing amber or blue glow that repairs any armour or shield damage they have taken . 
  tldr find a friend , follow him in a [ burst ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/burst ) . 
  you 'll get a real kick out of enl-a, 
  they can be in different corps/locations . 
  a solar system that 's good for mining might be ( and probably is ) terrible for getting into fights , be they pve and pvp . 
  the skill overlap is quite small , so you 're not really saving much time . 
  heck , mining characters do n't even really need capacitor skills . 
  mining , and to a greater extent industry , tie you down to a particular location or general area . 
  this often conflicts with the semi-nomadic nature of incursions or general pvp action . 
  they probably bitch about themselves under their breath . 
  what gets incentivized , gets done . 
  yes they are . 
  ishkurs are vicious little bastards , and while the algos is sometimes a bit clumsy for its role , the vexor shines as a rugged cruiser with surprising teeth . 
  in the battlecruiser and battleship classes , the myrmidon and dominix shine as durable drone platforms , while in the tech 2 lineup , the ishtar is a vexor on steroids , and even though most strategic cruisers eschew drones , most covert proteus fits use drones as a key component of their `` sneak up , spank you '' approach to combat . 
  ( hint : drones v ), 
  ( getting scout drone operation v and gallente drone specialization i to get access to tech 2 drones is also pretty good ), 
  generally , gallente ships can handle more/better drones at the same time de to higher bandwidth , whereas amarr ships have bigger drone bays to hold replacements . 
  it 's really up to personal preference . 
  pretty much . 
  which guides have you found so far ? 
  as long as you accept that sometimes , you 'll have to leave those drones on field and bug out , or lose entire flights to a well-timed smart bomb , then yes you can get a lot of utility out of a drone boat , even in the sub-cruiser cohort . 
  drone boats have the unique ability to apply decent damage to anything ; a vexor can send a flight of boosted light drones at a frigate , then a minute later , deploy two heavy drones and some mediums against a battleship . 
  added to that , the ability to apply any damage type ( with caveats ) and enough spare drone bay to carry utility drones ( ecm drones are good , as are repair and salvage drones ) means that they can become very jack-of-all trades ships . 
  blue donut strikes again . 
  just do n't build freighters . 
  the margins are terrible . 
  in fact last time i built a jump freighter i just bought a freighter because it was cheaper than manufacturing it . 
  message me if you want to offload the dust related codes .

  at least you 're in the commonwealth ; i 'll give you a pass . 
  this time . 
  also in australia . 
  i mean , we still understand what you 're trying to write , but you 're still spelling it wrong . 
  and those who do will judge you on it . 
  deal !, 
  * camping points from rooftops, 
  * acting like a high-damage version of the mass driver ( great for choke points ), 
  * it 's not actually that good, 
  most ships will have guns as well , but generally the ship bonuses are n't geared towards them ( or they have fewer turret slots ) so they 're usually secondary . 
  ccp also has the luxury of self-publishing , so no dishonourable third parties getting in the way . 
  ccp devs have implied that real-time integration is not on their launch checklist . 
  it will , of course , still be set in the eve universe ; perhaps they 're historical campaigns . 
  what 's wrong with the downvote button ?

  achievement unlocked : victim mentality . 
  considering that american spelling reform was due to dewey , whose efforts produced this :, 
   his theories of spelling reform ( to which end he founded the spelling reform association in 1886 ) [ 14 ] found some local success at lake placid : there is an `` adirondac loj '' in the area , and dinner menus of the club featured his spelling reform . 
  a september 1927 menu is headed `` simpler spelin '' and features dishes like hadok , poted beef with noodls , parsli or masht potato , butr , steamd rys , letis , and ys cream . 
  it also advises guests that `` all shud see the butiful after-glo on mountains to the east just befor sunset .

  i find it amusing that gevlon of all people understands the goon mentality better than many goons . 
   you win wars not by killing the enemy , but by making it painfully unpleasant to fight you . 
  goons do n't want to be in highsec . 
  gevlon forces them to defend their pocos . 
  rvb does n't really want to defend pocos , especially other people 's pocos ; it just does n't gel with their ethos . 
  marmite , however , loves highsec and is happy to poke the bear . 
  i assume you have something like this fit ?
