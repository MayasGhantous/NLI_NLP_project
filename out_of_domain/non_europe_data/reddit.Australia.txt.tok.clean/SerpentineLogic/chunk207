  well , some +3 attribute implants would n't go astray . 
  it 's fun to be oprah . 
  `` you get a caracal .

  bonus points if they 're fully fit and have all the required skill books and ammo in the cargo hold . 
  marmite just managed to get into a mutual war with red vs blue . 
  i 'd like to see who buckles first . 
  centre link has its own psychologists , who for some reason quickly turn into cynics . 
  wait , why in syndicate ? 
  is n't that npc null ? 
  you can set a corporation tax rate . 
  it 's like free money . 
  this should be more of a thing . 
  we 're just thankful there 's legitimate newbies for a change instead of spies pretending to be noobs . 
  under most circumstances , no . 
  for pvp though , definitely . 
  factional warfare . 
  caldari assault should have scope zoom bonus instead . 
   all people who do n't shower smell . 
  [ depends on the genes ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-without-underarm-protection/ ) . 
  why the hell would it be illegal ? 
  alan jones would never allow it . 
  there 's no wait time in my station in syndicate . 
  there 's barely any wait time in my other station in aridia . 
  highsec industry is meant to be safe , not necessarily the fastest or the most profitable . 
  help yourself to the dreadnaught cache while you 're at it . 
  if there is n't a sizeable valkyrie presence at ff14 , a few thousand nerds will flip tables . 
  we started on our kids soon after birth , but they did n't start using signs until about two months . 
  that time between two months and whenever they learned to talk was made so , so much better by them being able to communicate thirst etc. 
  if you resub by 1st of march , your name will go on the [ eve monument ] ( http://eve.com/monument ) ... , 
  not really ? 
  hey , central queensland is a great place to grow up in . 
  because it feels * so good * when you leave . 
  so just drop a new tank and recall the first one . 
  vov i transfer my isk to eve when it gets over 150m . 
  download it from [ dotlan ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/the_southern_legion ) ? 
  try eve who dot com ? 
  dotlan only tracks corps who have gained territories i think . 
  in that case start a second character on the same account since you wo n't be using both at the same time . 
  but why male models ? 
  yeah . 
  you 'll only need one or two month 's worth . 
  this has as much chance of happening as blizzard merging with google . 
  light dictors are best for new players . 
  pilots with 100m sp really are n't keen on being podded inside their own bubble . 
  1 . basic armour plates on everything . 
  as a new player , they are the most hp you can pack on per slot . 
  do n't deploy solo . 
  squad finder is there for a reason, 
  join a corporation ; my kdr doubles when i deploy with five corpmates who are , let 's face it , a lot better than me . 
  specialize . 
  yes , i know it 's hard , but getting e.g. 
  complex shield extenders really pays off .

  southern technologies if you like industry . 
  also , a side order of orbital strikes . 
  i know a guy with an eve account and dust account who will do it . 
  no , just from isk efficiency during pub matches . 
  [ vov ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=4055654 ), 
  i will throw proto if the match is good , and close , or if there 's someone i really want to take down . 
  i do n't mind going isk negative if i 'm having fun . 
  puppetry ? 
  ah , the good old backpfeifengesicht . 
  i 'm australian . 
  we wrote the book on it . 
  150k sp should get you basic shield and armor skills . 
  running a miltia-grade sica with :, 
  * basic light shield booster, 
  * basic shield hardener, 
  * basic heavy armour repairer, 
  * basic armour hardener, 
  should set you back maybe 85k and get you a fair bit of fun . 
  call in one per match and you should still be isk-positive . 
  if we wait a few hours she 'll be 38 . 
  i 'm seriously considering skilling sniper rifle just so i can counter-snipe thales users . 
  rifles get +5 % damage and +10 % range as they go up tiers . 
  mass drivers go up 10 % damage an +10 % splash radius instead . 
  this change will see :, 
  * old ** prototype ** md : 270 / 138, 
  * new ** standard ** md : 300 / 145, 
  hmm . 
  i have been known to orbital them in spite . 
  i 'm wobbly enough with a militia dropship ; heaven knows how bad i 'd be with an ads . 
  i believe suddenly ninjas used to give rewards for telling them about offline towers , but that may have stopped . 
  you may see some benefit from downloading eveiskperhour . 
  the books actually showed that the costs were rising , but the revenue was rising faster and sooner , so it was more than paying for itself . 
  caldari navy antimatter l, 
  nothing * legal * since [ bacon ] ( http://bacon.gunfleet.org/ ) . 
  oh , in that case , you need [ building capitals like a boss ] ( http://eve-fail.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/building-capitals-like-boss-part-1.html ) . 
  ah , the gallente , sandwiched between a caldari and an amarr and loving it . 
  does n't help if you have to scroll local . 
  so , you 're saying there 's a chance ? 
  if the md upgrade happens as planned , your existing proto md will be worse than the new ** standard ** md. 
  given your lack of free time , i suggest that no mmo would suit you . 
  one has more stars . 
   but why male models ? 
  no worse than airstrikes in beef . 
  a venture and some gas miner modules ( preferably tech 2 , since they 're a lot faster ), 
  does this count as left-leaning now ?
