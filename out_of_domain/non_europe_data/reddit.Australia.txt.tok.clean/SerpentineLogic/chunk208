  the trick is to be planning on getting your next job sooner than anyone else . 
  at university doing a degree for x ? 
  start looking for work experience as soon as you can , so you 'll have something arranged by august for the end of the year . 
  then , when you graduate , you can show that you 're already ahead of the game , which boosts your chances . 
  i loved dh , but i [ traded the books for a goat ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/brisgamers/comments/1mezt4/wtt_wh40k_rpg_books_for_a_goat/ ) . 
  1 . your scans are n't accurate so what you extract is not what you originally scanned . 
  resources deplete , so what you scanned yesterday may have run out by today . 
  just chain a rusted bicycle to it . 
  my goal each month is to plex my account while logging in the least . 
  this month i 'm up three plex with < 30 minutes logged-in time , so i already consider february , march and april to be won . 
  settle , petal . 
  you seem mad . 
  ca n't post busy mining rich vein of isk, 
  it 's interesting to note that the concept of time dilation originated from a good post like this . 
  sometimes you just have to float a crazy idea to see if it has legs . 
  arbitrage . 
  it 's more accurate to think of the man-hours needed to replace the losses , in this case , just a touch under 15 man-years are needed to recoup the losses . 
  you 'd be surprised how few alliances have < 2 jf pilots . 
  regardless , if said alliance was really that hard up for jf pilots , they 'd dump their freight at their turnaround point and if their alliance mates want it , they can fly there and get it . 
  i comprehend the scenario but i fail to see any problem with it . 
  i 'd gladly pay 40m isk to avoid aligning and warping a big ship 50 times . 
  jester worked out it needs to be higher . 
  there 's a post called cogs about it . 
  there 's a cap though , and interceptors reach it . 
  well , it was written a long time ago , when mmos were text based . 
  overview bugs happen , especially in ec-p8r, 
  shoot blues -  tell vi -, 
  what kind of things do you like to do ? 
  some days , when i 'm just not feeling it , i 'll get a scout suit with drop uplinks and let the rest of my team spawn behind the enemy , or find someone who looks like they can shoot , and follow them around with a repair tool , ammo and an injector . 
  scans are only shared with your squad , so unless you have someone in your squad killing the red dots you 're showing them , it wo n't be so useful . 
  swarms are okay , but i find that if you 're not running prototype swarms , you 're merely chipping paintwork off their hull . 
  even then , they 're a bit sub-par . 
  however , in uprising 1.8 , you will get partial war points for damaging vehicles so that will be a bit better . 
  after all , even if you ca n't kill a tank , you can get the consolation prize of some war points when you chase it away . 
  it will happen eventually anyway . 
  < ore  mining crystals requires < ore  processing to at least iii . 
  queenslangor !, 
  glad you got the joke eventually , i guess . 
  it had luke skywalker , gimli , the guy from hackers , and a porn star . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  eve is a spectator sport on par with wrestling , the premier league and daytime soaps . 
  aside from the side effect of * you * knowing where everyone is , yes , you were n't helping much . 
  perhaps you really are the worst dust player ever , 
  idle timer ? 
  love your blog . 
   hi , i 'd like to offer a short explanation of what yesterday 's matchmaking fix was all about . 
   in essence , there was a problem with squads getting added on the wrong team in public and academy battles . 
   so if you had a 4:8 battle and joined with a 4 player squad , it would sometimes put that squad on the team with 8 players , causing it to be 4:12 . 
  that should no longer happen with the fix . 
   however , you may still end up with temporary imbalances if someone joins with a 6 people squad on an already balanced match , say 10:10 , as it wo n't break up the squad . 
  thus you 'd get a 10:16 ( or 16:10 ) match until more players join the queue . 
   similar imbalances might happen if you have an 11:16 battle and all players in the queue are 6 player squads , as they would not fit into that battle . 
   thanks ,, 
   ccp draco, 
  i do exactly the same thing , except for the logging into eve bit . 
  i feel like such a foo right now . 
  next up on marlona sky 's blog :, 
   killmails : the cancer that 's killing / r/eve, 
  preferably one paid for by his prospective employer . 
  i mean , they * do * want him , right ? 
  [ computer says yes ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/642/10/5/0/5 ) . 
  build it . 
  i cut my teeth as a newbie in the [ teshkat ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/tash-murkon/teshkat#sec ) pocket . 
  killing battleship rats worth 800k a pop is heaps better than running level 2 missions .

  some of the fits may be a little tight , but they illustrate what can be done . 
  fucking everything . 
  a lot of corpmates have gone back to using ds3 . 
  aim assist on the controller is way better than the weird laggy mouse controls . 
  i 'd do the same , except my controller broke so all i have is my mouse . 
  i know a few eve players who are retired .

  magic : the gathering is the new bridge c/d, 
  do you realise the amount of grinding needed to get personal jump clones ? 
  ( hint : it 's quite a lot ), 
  did you know that null sec alliances have cloning facilities ( on capital industrial ships if nothing else ) that will circumvent this and allow you to get jump clones without standings requirements ? 
  ps : waiting until you 're ready is the wrong approach . 
  the right approach is to realise that you have literally nothing to lose , and to jump in with both feet . 
  the issue i always have with these sorts of polls is that pure `` i want this most '' rankings ignore the huge difference in effort between items .
