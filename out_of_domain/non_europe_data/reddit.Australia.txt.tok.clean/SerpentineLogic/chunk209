  worst title ever . 
  and that 's including / u/new _ eden_news_bot . 
  fixed , thanks . 
  all in the same hangar division of the same lab - this includes bpc , datacores and interfaces . 
  generally when you set up a job , it asks you which input and output hangar divisions for the job . 
  make sure the hangar that you chose as input is the one with all your materials . 
  if the station has invention lines , sure . 
  otherwise you will need to put everything in a lab . 
  i vehemently disagree . 
  i think a capital mining barge would be a better option than tiny tech 2 mining frigates . 
  nullsec needs massive amounts of minerals if it has a hope of weaning itself off the teat of high sec afk miners . 
  if ratting in a carrier is risky but rewarding , why not let miners do the same thing ? 
  most humiliating . 
  hot drop . 
  ever . 
  ( you may have to lern2python ), 
  that 's fine and a great thing to aim for . 
  however , while there 's a great progression for combat players all the way up to titans , it 's condescending to leave miners with the stunted progression of venture -  barge -  exhumer and just tell them `` bring more isboxes lol '', 
  not sure if cute or creepy, 
  the numbers seem more even ; the quality of your blues and reds varies wildly as usual . 
  the thing about nyain san is that other corporations * let them * get away with 50 timers in the same hour window . 
  i guess the approach would be to overwhelm them with the support of a lot of ringers . 
  they ca n't defend fifty timers at once . 
  you could remote desktop to your home computer if you 're that keen . 
  nvidia showed a proof of concept tablet running eve at fanfest 2012 , but we have n't heard anything since . 
  i did n't think using shield transporters on the mcc still worked . 
  start mowing your neighbours lawns . 
  all the isk i 'm not actively using goes into my plex stockpile for this reason . 
  i read an article where the author preferred the movie to the book he wrote . 
  i once made four plex in one hour , but even then it was n't hugely above an extra hour of work , and certainly not as sustainable . 
  maybe try a gnosis then . 
  no skills required to fly it, 
  battlecruiser hull , as requested . 
  18 slots . 
  gives hefty bonuses to weapons ( and probes ) without needing any extra skill training . 
  [ i 'm sold . 
  does not actually nerf power projection, 
  just makes non-power-projection-related jumps more difficult, 
  shows distinct lack of thought regarding follow-on effects . 
  ultimately , a bad post . 
  you 're +25 to me , thus i am contractually obligated to agree with you . 
  welcome to w-space . 
  during triple skill point weekends , the number of sp gained per wp varies . 
  last time , it was 1 wp = 5 sp , which was okay , but still a bit of a grind if nobody came out to play that match . 
  depending on your net connection , it might be reasonable to have the cloud handle all the processing and just send you the pre-rendered display , like [ amazon appstream does ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ig2o6whli ) . 
  collect the whole set !, 
  a study in the 90 's showed that it does n't take much to retain strength at risk of loss due to aging ; about three reps per week at ( close to ) your maximum weight will suffice .

  you should put them on [ teespring ] ( http://teespring.com/ ) as a one-off deal . 
  you design a shirt, 
  you choose a price ( hint : if you make zero profit , ccp will be okay with using the derivative work of pictures of eve ships . 
  if you 're making a profit , all bets are off ), 
  choose a minimum number of shirts , which affects the cost . 
  get people to order a shirt . 
  ** if ** the minimum is met , they get shirts , ** if not ** they get their money back . 
  the correct way would be in a blockade runner .

  only one ice mining rig will fit on a ship . 
  [ really tanky fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/procurer_tank.png ) : 75000 effective hp, 
  [ fit for mining yield ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/procurer_yield.png ) : 57000 effective hp ( slightly less if you swap the em hardener with a survey scanner ), 
  ice mining fits will be a little bit less due to fitting an ice mining rig , but you wo n't need the survey scanner . 
  i have a petition answered by ccp eterne that says it 's okay , so feel free to take it up with him . 
  agony does [ pvp training classes ] ( http://www.agony-unleashed.com/wiki/index.php?title=pvp-basic ) if you 're into that . 
  to be fair , they still do this to british sporting teams . 
  oh yeah , chromosone aiming ; so , so good . 
   blasters and pulse lasers , yes , t2 is needed to be viable in most cases ( unless you 're lucky as hell ), 
  in general , the short-ranged turrets really benefit from the long-range t2 ammo and t2 guns are the default for those types of weapon . 
  the longer-ranged turrets such as beams , rails and artillery do n't generally use t2 ammunition and are harder to fit , so you 'll often find players downgrading to meta 4 versions . 
  missiles fall into the latter category , and you 'll see meta 4 launchers even on pvp fits ( especially meta 4 torpedoes on stealth bombers ), 
  better yet , you and your mate both buy houses , then rent them to each other for next to nothing . 
  what hull or hulls will you be fitting them to ? 
  * never * go full poetic . 
  * [ accelerated ejection bay ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/30122/0/5/0/5 ), 
  * [ dissolution sequencer ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/30050/0/5/0/5 ), 
  there 's also evanova , which currently has a lot more stuff in it ( except for the fitting screen ) which you can ask questions of / u/evanova . 
  worse ; he 's a poster . 
  it 's the eve catch and release program .
