  crucible iterations +7.2 % +13.7 % ??? 
   the record is clear : in terms of attracting new players and retaining old ones to play the game , incarna ranks as the least successful expansion in modern eve history . 
   so much for bad news . 
  let 's turn to the good , and it starts with the new line at the end of that table . 
  as you can see , in its first 60 days of release , crucible has gone a long way toward repairing the damage !, 
  so far , it ranks with dominion and apocrypha as a solid success . 
  here 's the updated chart showing average logged-in players for the last six months :, 
   [ http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/eve-players-crucible.png] ( http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/eve-players-crucible.png ), 
   this time , concentrate on the maroon 30-day rolling average line . 
  after free-falling to its new normal of around 27,500 players logged in per day , crucible was released on 29 november 2011 . 
  and as you can see , the improvement was almost immediate !, 
  after a dip caused by expansion-related downtime , things are heading back upward right up to the present day . 
   26 february was a sunday , the last sunday shown on this chart . 
  and if snapcount is to be believed , 26 february was the most successful sunday eve online has had since early june 2011 , eight months ago . 
  out of the woods yet ? 
  nope , not hardly . 
  the incursion expansion set new records for numbers of logged-in players . 
  with the bleeding stopped , the current counts have recovered from the 10.7 % dip inflicted by incarna . 
  things are back to where they were just prior to the release of that expansion . 
  prior to incarna , looked at in the long term , eve 's logged-in player 90-day rolling average was stagnated at 30,000 . 
  right now , we 're just below that . 
   but there 's certainly cause for hope !, 
   and thanks to snapcount , i 'll be able to keep you updated on it into 2012 and hopefully beyond . 
  i guess i * am * stalin his thunder . 
  bots aside ( good point btw ) , prospective players are affected strongly by the sentiments of existing players , both in-game , and in the gaming media . 
  if everyone is bitching about occupying jita and $ 70 monocles , they are less likely to hang around . 
  if everyone is posting icame.jpg images in local after going on a tornado roam , supported by non-terrible oneiros logis , with non-terrible assault frigates as tough tackle , then they 're more likely to stay subscribed to that magical 6-month mark ( after which , ccp statistics indicate nobody ever permanently unsubs ), 
  regarding bots : evidence suggests they have a disproportinate effect on the game . 
  ccp banned ten market bots last week , and everyone in jita is enjoying trading again without being 0.01 isked every five minutes without fail . 
  just ten bots -  over 500 happier traders . 
  train gas mining v or not at all . 
  tech 2 gas miners are a lot faster than t1 , not counting the fact that you can fit five of them when your skill level is maxed . 
  as far as gas mining ships go , anything with five turrets and a large cargo bay is fine . 
  many people do it in a cheap battlecruiser . 
  generally , though , gas mining is not very profitable outside of w-space . 
  just in time to vote , 
  the same thing david hasslehoff did to his mom . 
  ca n't he be both ? 
  compare this to the eastern taipan , another australian snake . 
  less venomous ( only third most venomous * in the world * ) , but makes up for it by biting you multiple times . 
  i saw a tv episode that had steve irwin as a guest , and he mentioned the eastern taipan . 
  one of the hosts asked `` so , if you get bitten , what do you do ? '', 
  steve irwin looked at him , and said , `` well , first thing , you take off your shirt , and roll it into a ball . '', 
  `` then you place it on top of your arm , and rest your head on it . '', 
  the host asked `` how does that help ? '', 
  irwin replied , `` that 's so you 're nice and comfy while you die . '', 
  holy shit . 
  two of the most hair-raising things in one news article . 
  spiders, 
  wolf creek, 
  this is true . 
  eucalyptus trees are self-pruning , so if you sleep underneath them , there 's a small chance that a ( large ) branch drops onto you while you sleep and kills you . 
  `` that 's not a brush with death . 
  * this * is a brush with death . '', 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  some of the sheep are ok . 
  in new zealand , they call them stewnfush . 
  covert ops ships have bonuses to scan probe strength , as well as the ability to fit covert ops cloaking devices . 
  it 's almost as if they were * designed * to do exploration . 
  * slow food clap *, 
  btw durian smells really weird but is actually quite tasty . 
  100 % of time was spent stopping things from getting worse .

  there 's a rumor that this year 's party will have a lot less cocaine than last year , if you know what i mean ... 
  i 'm sure their sales figures were * stellar * , and the japanese cars made no inroads * at all * into their market share .

  so train a character for capitals anyway . 
  if you decide you do n't want them , sell them on the character bazaar . 
   650dps with good skills, 
  closer to 800 if you fit the sixth launcher . 
  prometheus , because he 's quite good at ship balancing . 
  you sure ? 
  an even moderately-factioned tengu should be able to output more than that . 
  let 's see what i can dredge up . 
  tengu propulsion - fuel catalyst, 
  tengu offensive - accelerated ejection bay, 
  tengu defensive - amplification node, 
  tengu engineering - augmented capacitor reservoir, 
  tengu electronics - dissolution sequencer,
