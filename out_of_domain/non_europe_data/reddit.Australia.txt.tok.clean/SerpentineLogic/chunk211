  goon swarm federation prefers to recruit from its home forum , something awful .

  train cloaking . 
  once you deploy your probes , move away a few thousand metres then cloak up ( preferably while still moving ) . 
  then you can scan in relative safety , at least until you need to warp somewhere . 
  eventually , you can get into a buzzard which can even warp while cloaked . 
  sec status 5 means he spends more time killing npcs than players . 
  in a 0.4 system , it 's no guarantee of safety . 
  he probably had the same idea as you did and decided to do some competitive exploration .

  well , you 'll still have to manufacture the t1 item as inputs to manufacturing the t2 item , so it 's not wasted . 
  but no , it 's not really useful to research the rest of the bpos you make copies from if you already have a single well-researched one for manufacturing from . 
  many ships have increased build costs compared to previous years , sothe market for them is depressed . 
  i still have a few hundred industrial ships remaining from that time . 
  i talked to hans today . 
  he said that oneframethreadlag is definitely turned on in dust , but it wo n't be turned off in the near future ( although he gave the impression that ccp rouge 's first dev blog will be a doozy and nobody can guarantee anything after that is released ), 
  i guess the problem is that performance is pretty marginal as it is , so there just is n't the headroom to disable it . 
  in addition , it 's pretty nice to all the console players that mkb is handicapped . 
  unreal engine 3 also happens to be a very cheap engine to license .

  `` brb nuking goonfeet from orbit '', 
  perhaps they 're changing the buddy program . 
  currently , the existing eve player gets all the rewards and then has to manually give stuff over to the new player . 
  a much better idea would be to have a series of choosable gifts , e.g `` when you subscribe , you will be offered a choice of rewards . 
  if you choose the `` miner buddy pack '' , your buddy will get a buddy orca , and you will get a buddy mackinaw '' or something like that . 
  hey , the more ships that look like the power loader from aliens , the better .
