  best of luck to them . 
  competition spurs innovation . 
  that would make him a bni baby . 
  clear your eve cache ? 
  if it 's such an issue , keep your launcher window open after login and you 'll download automaticlly . 
  i also have never needed the functionality , since downtime happens right in my prime time , so i always know about it . 
   brisbane coming up on march 15th, 
  holy shit i 'll be there ( again ), 
  or , you know , change downtime . 
  as a goon , should n't he be telling everyone that 's the joining fee to get into the pub ? 
  connection timed out vov . 
  because your planetary skills are low , so where the resource hotspots actually are is different to what the scanner shows you . 
  he runs a radio show , so that should not prove difficult to achieve . 
  what link ? 
  you 're mising out . 
  the other being napoleon felt like paris deserved not to suck ? 
  apparently the upgraded parisian sewer system was the envy of europe , so they had that as well . 
  they 're still in the demolition phase though . 
  5 % complex damage module ? 
  okay , guess it 's back to shield extenders then . 
  my thought is that my scrams will still cut through shields well , but i 'll still be at a huge disadvantage when trying to kill the other 70 % of their hit points ;(, 
  apply to much crying old experts . 
  eve has a lot fewer bots now . 
  google the summer of rage . 
  isk inflation . 
  it goes down a bit in march but realistically , the days of plex below 600m isk are gone . 
  because enough people can afford it to keep the price there . 
  ccp disclosed general numbers recently ; it 's only a couple percent , and it 's an unreliable demand . 
  my px 21 lasted nine weeks . 
  we 'll get to that as soon as we 've mined the rich seam of titanic jokes . 
  mine died because the cable is not twist-resistant , so wires started breaking where the cable connected to the earpiece . 
  i hope those people realise that a lot of the price premium of t2 items is * due to * the effort involved . 
  i agree . 
  the price points are too high, 
  most of the particular skins available are n't to my taste, 
  *** i 'll still buy some *** because i like where it 's going . 
  batch industry jobs added -  prices plummet -  t2 manufacturers [ realise ] ( http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ive-made-a-huge-mistake-gob-arrested-development.gif ) what they have done . 
  only because of you , sir . 
  sigh , wish my ps3 controller was n't broken so i could try the difference ;(, 
  it 's the client load i 'd be worried about . 
  they 'd need to remove skins when you 're using low quality settings . 
  chromosome mkb was so , so good in comparison to uprising :(, 
  that 's exactly what 's needed for the short term . 
  he 's ex csm if that helps any . 
  i kill things with my swarms all the time . 
  however , it 's really not cost effective ; it 's a rare thing to kill a tank without losing one or more suits . 
  you know how you discovered that you rarely make calls on your phone any more , and just use it for internet stuff instead ? 
  like that , but more . 
  i should buy him a beer , then . 
  the trick is to be the guy who 's still in range when someone else forces them to drive off ... 
  my av suits cost as much as a tank , so there 's room for argument there . 
  [ okay .

  that adds another layer of sorrow to the situation . 
  are you still in the academy matches ? 
  things get considerably more real after the academy . 
  i 'll take `` invitations you do n't want people to take you up on '' for 400 , alex. 
  we need an api for this exact reason . 
  you can . 
  for instance , i will send dust isk to someone in exchange for plex . 
  it 's not a 1:1 exchange though . 
  edit : why the down votes ? 
  confirming that my wife started getting baby-related advertising when she was pregnant . 
  if you really need that much safety , then you can buy and sell templar packs through the code bazaar and enjoy ccp-enforced fraud protection . 
  for smaller amounts , escrow-style isk transfer works fine , provided you choose the right vendor . 
  i use a [ corp mate ] ( http://dustboard.com/global/merc/sponksponksponk ) for my isk transfers ( in both directions ) , but i have used others in the past . 
  petri dishes are immune to the placebo effect . 
  so , giving up your time ? 
  that 's the way to bet . 
  whoop whoop,

  i have a lot of respect for anyone who 'd risk their life for a * chance * to become a resident of australia . 
  maybe he 's taking his medication . 
  we 've had access to us weapons research for decades . 
  i would be quite disappointed in the australian military if they could n't whip up a nuclear weapon within 30 minutes from parts that they * just happened to have lying around * in the same facility . 
  dump stuff in a jetcan , scoop with another character . 
  the items will just appear in your asset list . 
  iceland is in utc , no daylight savings issues . 
  i think not . 
  i will take extra pleasure blowing such ships up . 
  ah , the circlejerk of life . 
  apocalypse avengers edition ? 
  tengu is a side grade rather than an upgrade . 
  i 'd run a tengu for exploration content rather than pure mission-running . 
  as far as the golem issue goes , by the time you really need a golem ( compared to a cnr ) , you 'll already have the skills to use it . 
  if it 's not that , it 's fucking wind turbine syndrome . 
   all data on jovian vessels suddenly disappear from capsuleer ship databases ; conspiracy theorists go wild , until a concord official explains they just decided to archive the information due to a lack of recent sightings . 
  world shaping, 
   changed names of two planets in [ 8s-0e1 ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/pure_blind/8s-0e1#sov ) as a part of a reward for a dust 514 tournament :, 
   * planet iii becomes eon prime, 
   * planet iv becomes ancient gliese, 
  because it 's territories controlled by mordus legion , the mercenary outfit responsible for leaking the dust project to the wider universe .
