  brisbane this weekend ), 
  yeah , probably easier for your corp to join an existing rental alliance . 
  til there are people who think that song did n't exist before madagascar . 
  bravenewbies is like a year old , most corps never take their first system ever . 
  so , apply for a position at ccp ? 
  can someone help me out a bit here and provide some context ? 
  [ nekminit ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/204jqv/hey_my_names_micaela_and_i_was_unintentionally/ ), 
  i think ccp have realised that if you pay peanuts for outsourced developers and game designers , you get monkeys . 
  like ocean liners , big mistakes like that take a long time to turn around . 
  frankly , i do n't expect any measurable improvements until 1.9 , and have n't since uprising 1.2, 
  not to put to fine a point on it , but until ccp rouge was hired , oversight was a bit lacking at the shanghai office . 
  i still play occasionally . 
  some weeks i even cap out . 
  there 's a lot to learn about this game still , especially if you play on the us servers where tactics are further ahead . 
  does n't omitting todays data still incentivise rampant cache scraping ? 
  but they 'll want notifications when they 've been underbid , which necessitates more recent data than that . 
  return of the mack ( inaw ), 
  cool . 
  is this indication that we 'll see more crest endpoints , sooner , or was it a one-off kind of thing ? 
  what 's wrong with jackson or other json libraries ? 
  frankly , i 'd rather you helped one of the existing android apps to improve . 
  how many articles does the average writer submit over their tmdc career ? 
  do they give reasons for burning out or do they just stop returning your emails ? 
  a bit provocative , but a good question . 
  everyone rails on gaming sites for bias , but we see a site created in response stumble at the same hurdle . 
  do n't sell yourself short ; you really * are * a special breed of sperglord . 
  aura is closed source but i think k evanova and eve watch are open source . 
  one article a month is zero pay ? 
  to each their own . 
  payment structures like that make me less enthusiastic rather than more . 
  there 's a saying that a military commander spends men ; he does n't want to , but sometimes they are a necessary cost of achieving the greater objective , and once they 're gone , they 're gone . 
  politicians are the same way , except they spend their principles . 
  i take it this has been posted on the dust forums ? 
  mad max : the documentary . 
  i saw it being posted , but looks like the thread got deleted . 
  welp . 
  actually this is the one i saw : http://dustsearch.com/thread/147298/, 
  it 's another ddos attack . 
  eve is being hit hard as well . 
  i hope they use these drones to find lost hikers and sailors . 
  i bet they can hang around searching a lot longer using three shifts of people watching a screen compared to planes and helicopters that run out of fuel every couple of hours . 
  afk in a pos while posting magic the gathering fan fiction on facebook . 
  new player who happens to have 35 bucks in his bank account . 
  how incredibly rare . 
  did n't this start with dust devs ? 
  it was probably when i learned that shield supercaps can have more effective hp than armour supercaps , even accounting for high-grade slave implants . 
  iirc valkyrie gently reminds you that fighter pilots should not be standing up in their seat if it detects you 're about to clip the cockpit . 
  yes , but it really started to matter when deadspace invulnerability fields were introduced ; before , the alternative to cnif was an officer invuln , which is somewhat overkill for a super carrier . 
  also , stacked pdu 's in the low slots and the relatively-cheap genolution sets help . 
  not even with barrage ? 
  well , australia does n't have a second amendment right , which makes it easier to get legislation like that over the line . 
  for better or worse , us gun control is just really hard to accomplish because of this . 
  about all you can do is avoid the truly egregious scenarios and hope for the best . 
  low vitamin d also causes fertility problems in women ; this is probably the reason why northern europeans have such fair skin ( apart from inuit etc who get vitamin d from their diet rather than relying on the sun ), 
  as an australian , i * know * that the sun is trying to kill me , so vitamin d supplements are probably a better idea than , for instance , skin cancer . 
  in fact , someone i know is [ running a scientific research study ] ( http://www.cresunandhealth.org.au/story/dhealth.jsp ) to determine whether we should fortify various foods with vitamin d in the interest of public health . 
  does the top of your head even * have * vitamin d creating cells ? 
  you can buy natural light globes for your house . 
  i use mouse and keyboard but it 's pretty ordinary in most cases due to input lag ( it 's barely acceptable when sniping or using a tank/lav but that 's about it ) but , since my controller broke , that 's all i can use gov. 
  maybe the rest of them just retake the districts dendrilops loses ... 
  i adore your wide-eyed innocence . 
  even if you eventually decide dust is n't for you , you can help your corp or alliance in facwar or molten heath by dropping orbitals on their opponents ... 
  yeah , some times when i 'm feeling uncoordinated , i 'll just drop a militia tank . 
  after all , when it dies it 's still cheaper than losing three advanced suits . 
  in that case , maybe joining faction warfare will be a good idea ; you can get your eve on , while also listening to dust channels to see where the next flashpoint will be . 
  but hey , your dust character is still passively training so it 's all good . 
  geronimo jerky in brisbane is top-notch . 
  vigilantes who happen to be [ photographed ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/yes-russia-controls-crimea-and-yes-those-really-are-russian-troops/ ) carrying vss rifles , which are only given out to the russian spetznaz . 
  i think it 's fair to say that russia has deployed actual troops to ukraine and is daring the rest of the world to do anything about it . 
  so , an extra 250k sp for each 250k kills between 1m and 2m . 
  seems fair . 
  [ yay 1980 's warhammer 40k reference ~ ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bolt_thrower ), 
  why not both ? 
  start another character , join brave newbies . 
  [ duh ] ( http://pozniak.pl/database/index.php?id=10&amp;id2=1&amp;nr=21641 ), 
  plus the fact that you 're a foot shorter than your average south korean ... 
  http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/warravens_auxiliaries , then presumably into warravens, 
  elaborate ? 
  in fact , there were [ a few riots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lambing_flat_riots ) on the goldfields , as the euro gold diggers/panniers would n't understand how the chinese would come after everyone else left a claim , then work the shit out of the mine and get more gold after everyone thought it was all gone . 
  alternatively , government cctv can stay , as long as * anyone * can view it . 
  see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_transparent_society, 
  well i never saw her post to the dust forums either . 
  fairly certain that she did get let go though . 
  she has n't posted to twitter or the dust forums since november . 
  i guess you got pretty lucky that match . 
  the ones i 've been in , i dropped down to 0.5 fps within the first couple minutes , with predictable results . 
  i once spent half a match trying to get out of the room i spawned in :(, 
  it 's not network lag , it 's the ps3 dying . 
   also , sorry for podding you , bro =p, 
  ( he 's not ), 
  looks like crucible was as big a hit as reported . 
  so many vets coming back that the plex price shot up and kept its trajectory . 
  was inferno faction warfare 2.0 ? 
  looks like things stabilized for a while until people realised just how much isk they could pull out of fw and things went haywire again . 
  they 'll know what to do . 
  i think the booster had to be in the first 24 hours after the event started . 
  just in case , i plugged mine in just before downtime . 
  [ skill yourself ] ( http://pozniak.pl/database/index.php?id=10&amp;id2=1&amp;nr=32999 ) ? 
  well , it will hurt it indirectly because it competes with survey scanners . 
  * nothing * goes good with hakarl .
