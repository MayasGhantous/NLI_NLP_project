  from what i understand , when you 're making 20b per month , it 's customary to write a blog about how bad everyone who ca n't do the same thing are . 
  bonus points for broken english or donating 90b to test . 
  i mean , you basically only use cars to drive to the movies or concerts , not for anything useful . 
  the university of queensland has an [ international house ] ( http://www.internationalhouse.uq.edu.au ) , which many foreign students prefer to stay at , at least for the first year or two . 
  well , yeah , that 's exactly the kind of thing you do , so you can then blog about it .

  perhaps someone was drinking too much from the [ counterops ] flask . 
  you can use escrow to transfer isk between games . 
  you just have to know the right people . 
  and yet , quite welcome . 
  tuesday . 
  transferred enough dust isk to buy 6 plex . 
  have never been ripped off yet . 
  of course it 's not 1:1 . 
  it 's a crap load harder to earn dust isk than eve isk . 
  5.5:1 is still pretty decent rate . 
  that 's as may be , but i had a spare 500m dust isk , so i took that exchange rate . 
  you 're welcome to set up a service to undercut them . 
  it also works both ways . 
  i can drop a few billion into the eve wallet and send it to dusts . 
  that happens in real life too , or between isk and plex . 
  why would it be different ? 
  2 minutes ? 
  imo it should be the same duration as gate cloak , *** tops *** . 
  amusingly , if you 're the type to run prototype suits ( or even advanced suits sometimes ) , it may be cheaper to run tanks than suits .

  no , seriously . 
  so they 're willing to put their life on the line for their country , but not their career ?

  newer constitution means more patches to loopholes in previous attempts at government . 
  compare and contrast from democracy v1 .0 _ usa edition . 
  the beta had a lot fewer features , but third-party extensions built on that into the westminster gui that you see today . 
  fyi my opinion is that , if you need to do something to avoid eula violations ( like pulling them into teamspeak or forcing them to sign up to a third-party site or download some app ) , you 're going too far .

  can anyone confirm ? 
  so , he admits to having a collection of irl photos of players who rubbed mayonnaise on themselves trying to get their stuff back , at his behest ? 
  yeah , i really do n't see his csm campaign doing well . 
  and honestly , very few weapons have camera feeds that you can analyse endlessly afterwards if a mistake is made .

  if i were zuck , i 'd build some sort of steam-platform-for-rift and basically just collect rent on anything virtual . 
  bonus points for micro transaction framework . 
  it 's in addition to the rift , which is better . 
  i think ccp have learned that if you 're going to lock yourself into a platform , there better be a swimming pool of cash involved . 
   `` today 's acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing . 
  i believe oculus can be one of the platforms of the future , '' zuckerberg said . 
  ... `` we now have oculus joining us , which long-term can be one of the next important computing platforms . 
  ** and of course we will continue to focus on our extremely important work of building out our advertising platform as well , as part of this . 
  read into that what you will . 
  bug list is pretty big this time round , and includes regression of previously-working features which is kinda worse . 
  ... if they were n't ridiculously slow and heavy , and thus get pounced on . 
  corax is okay , but i prefer the kiting approach to dealing with multiple frigates .
