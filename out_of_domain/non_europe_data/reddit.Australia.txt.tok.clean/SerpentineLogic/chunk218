  you had me until mongoloidal . 
  i think they usually come out in october , sometimes april . 
  you wo n't download a car either . 
  no do n't . 
  i only want to see the ` best ' tmc articles , not every bit of reposted news ever . 
  is n't shadow ban a reddit wide thing ? 
  at the end of the day , a plex saves you fifteen bucks of subscription . 
  a stockpile of plex will have a floor value reflecting this . 
  yeah , especially since the last thing you want to do after re-upping is having to fork over rl cash to keep playing . 
  extraction in all sec status systems is a net positive source of income , but it 's rarely worth it n high sec unless your character is stuck there for some reason ( i.e. 
  industry alt with a pos to babysit ), 
  processing is more hit-and-miss . 
  highsec has a huge advantage in that it 's really easy logistics , e.g. 
  buy a mass of cheap p1 and turn it into p2 and sell it 2 days later for 70m more than you bought it for . 
  note that you can actually lose money if the market goes against you . 
  the export duties can really eat into your profit as well : minimum 5 % , plus whatever the corp adds to it ( usually < 5 % , but still ) . 
  p0-p1 is especially sensitive to taxes so you just wo n't make money there . 
  as far as processing profitability goes , i will direct you [ here ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/archive/index.php/t-1207.html ? 
  there 's probably separate news feeds for each game though . 
  i have overheating problems with the amarr commando :(, 
  i 'm used to amarr assault v , so it basically happens all the time because i 'm expecting about 20 % more firing time than i have . 
  why not stop training on your main while the alt skills up , if you really do n't want to spend the money ? 
  unlike * all the other * antagonistic moves , which are just honest mistakes / s, 
  i think ccp is a bit wary of being platform-exclusive now . 
  tldr ; you die , your estate pays tax based on how big it is , then gets handed out according to your will . 
  i just love it when foreshadowing happens . 
  i think there 's also the ` news ' vs ` articles ' divide , where people weight them differently . 
  disregarding externally-applied sig effects , mwd is net harmful to getting hit when, 
  * the mwd has n't helped you get out of optimal range, 
  * you 're at less than max speed, 
  * you 're less than perpendicular to whoever 's shooting at you, 
  this happens more often than you 'd expect . 
  it 's a testament to how powerful mobility and pulling range is , that people use mwds at all . 
  nyain san is using caldari scouts . 
  i happen to agree with them that they are the top choice in this meta . 
  gallente scout is a close second , though . 
  oh , i love orinoco flow . 
  generally yes , although there 's ample room for some of the squad to be running precision amps and range extenders for anti-shotgun duties . 
  i wonder how he counters accusations from all the other csm members they he did fuck all during his term ? 
  tldr ; rechargers for shield tanking because you have more to lose and less to gain , energizers for armour tanking because the opposite . 
  if you have all the modules in your hangar , you can fit a ship according to a saved fit very , very quickly . 
  it 's been april for [ 13 hours ] ( http://i.imgur.com/svgidtd.gif ) in australia . 
  greater than sign, 
  in what way are the joining requirements similar ? 
   how 's israels dear population ? 
  doing fine , darling . 
  inb4 april, 
  demand will drop though , since super pilots will suddenly be using half as many . 
  something something election time, 
  i thought [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxso6i5yhyy ) was their song . 
  perhaps run a cheap flux active scanner ? 
  at least you 'll see * some * of the enemies coming . 
  you ca n't do the entire production chain without a tower . 
  this is where the most profit is , unsurprisingly . 
  exactly what the nerds at / r/oculus were worried about ? 
   if you say anything else - one word - i will kill myself . 
  gentlemen , i give you the `` reverse mittani '' technique . 
  most of the players i know who manufacture boosters do so in a safe posethat otherwise would be doing nothing useful except as a place to warp to and change ships . 
  let 's say 15b isk for a capital pilot . 
  that 's 20 plex , or three hundred dollars . 
  so unless you 're very lucky or your corp has a dreadnaught cache you can liquidate , it would take you however long it takes you to earn $ 300 . 
  to borrow a phrase from the goons , `` i 'm not here to ruin the market ; i 'm just here to ruin * your * market . '', 
  that was implicit in the conceptual switch from isk to dollars when talking about the resources required . 
  fuck off we 're full ^ ( of food and it was delicious ; my compliments to the chef . ), 
  1 . you wo n't crash the plex market in jita, 
  when you 're in the middle of your career , it 'll take you 3.6 hours instead of 36 . 
  you could always just train up a capital pilot on your single account ? 
  this is not difficult to achieve . 
  now do squad broken . 
  then this subreddit would be full of fedo piles . 
  i work in it , doing lots of thinking in exchange for money . 
  which alliance ? 
  i did the [ math ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/devpost-avalanche/ ) on gardes and was wondering where this alleged 8 % buff was . 
  step one ( buying the code with isk ) is the problematic bit . 
  ... but that 's not the way to bet . 
  does that make the barista a caffellatrix ? 
  the idea is to * grow * the player base , not switch 10 % of eve subscribers to a f2p game and lose most of the subscription money . 
  hence , not-pc , and sony-giving-them-cash-for-exclusivity . 
  i think this is a key desire from both sides of the eve-dust link . 
  dust can affect how hard it is to take a faction warfare system by + / - 20 % , but dusties ca n't actually take a system . 
  dust occupancy affects planets in lowsec , but only in a single region ( and it 's [ ** 90.6 % ** controlled by dirt nap squad ] ( http://www.dustcharts.com/moldenheath ) ) . 
  it needs to be everywhere , even if it 's only expanded in stages ( low sec + npc null would be a good first step , even if it 's only a single planet per system ), 
  it takes a * lot * of work to make a video that bad . 
  tldr ; uses your api key to fetch eve mail and turn into actual email , with urls to reply ( via eve gate , since there 's no api access to send eve mails ), 
  zero precision enhancers : you can see noob non-gallente scouts on passive scan . 
  one ( complex ) precision enhancer : you can see noob gal scouts , and cloaked/damped non-gal scouts on scan . 
  two enhancers : you can see cloaked gal scouts or cloaked + damped non-gal scouts . 
  past that , it 's unlikely to be useful . 
  if you want bitterness , you should try failheap . 
  i once had a guy tell me to go back to where i was born . 
  i replied , `` what , rockhampton ? '', 
  the same way you 'd put shit on someone for supporting collingwood . 
  my family has been in australia for fifty years longer than pauline hanson 's . 
  if we 're going to play the `` go back to where you came from '' game , i know who 'll win . 
  no , seriously , try failheap . 
  / r/evemarketplace, 
  hey , it works like that in real life , why not in eve ? 
  armour repairers have a skill to reduce grid .
