  this fit outputs 701 dps , even without the third faction bcs . 
  ( 744 dps with a couple of +3 % implants , or 785 dps with some +5 % implants and the third cn bcs ), 
  so brave . 
  lives practically forever, 
  makes * you * wait for * him *, 
  it takes a brave man to surrender with a bunch of republican guard standing behind you . 
  one word : rambo . 
  you 're doing something wrong then . 
  as i said in my [ other post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qnuoq/level_4_mission_grinding_rattlesnake_vs_tengu/c3z3okr ) , a 3-cnbcs fit with implants emits 785 dps ; more if you switch rigs for max rof . 
  buying a 600m isk ship then t2 fitting it seems deliberately self-limiting . 
  this is true . 
  there are only six outback steakhouse restaurants in australia , and they 're all within the sydney urban sprawl . 
  also , no australian would recognise anything on the menu . 
   i could have used my monocular, 
  then he 'd * know * you 're an eve player . 
  to be honest , i 've done this ever since homeworld . 
  or they also play eve . 
  * check your receipts !, 
  i think reddit user , not eve player , 
  and yet , one would imagine that the major stuff like murder would disqualify you , with weed possession * somewhere * further down the list . 
  i have n't killed the groove . 
  i have , however , burned this goddamn house right down . 
  contract scamming gone oh so very * right * . 
  evetimecode.com sometimes has discount codes , which will save you 5 or 10 % . 
  makes a huge difference to a women 's fertility , too . 
  this is a key reason why everyone in scandinavia is so white ( or get their vitamin d from fish oil , like the inuit ), 
  the american flag on the moon : likely to last more than 3000 years . 
  alien sex , though . 
  so brave ^ new ^ world, 
  no , but i read * harrison bergeron * . 
  i ca n't imagine andrew bolt would be happy about this . 
  get some ( 500 + ) nab shares then , and you get that [ waived ] ( http://www.nab.com.au/wps/wcm/connect/nab/nab/home/about_us/6/5/2/ ) . 
  ofc if you can afford that many nab shares , $ 20/year is small change . 
  there should be a way to tag a certificate that you 're aiming towards and just automatically train the skills until it 's done . 
  then again , if that happened , i 'd login a lot less often . 
  post fit ? 
  the ~ ~ hel ~ ~ nid is n't terrible ; it 's not substantially less tanky than a thanatos . 
  it is , however , the best at repping so tends to be primaried . 
  but , hey , repping is what carriers are good at , so it 's still useful . 
  ( re the hel : in supercap-vs-subcap fleet fights where fighter-bombers are n't deployed , supercarriers are often used as extra-tough remote reps for titans . 
  in this case , having more effective reps is very useful , if a bit niche ), 
   amazing what can be done when a bunch of greenpeace fuckwits are n't whipper-snippering the experimental crops to death . 
  i think the csiro could put up a logical argument against them in this case . 
  they 're just adding back a gene that humans bred out of wheat a few ( dozen ) centuries ago . 
  it 's not as if they 're inserting dinosaur genes or anything .
