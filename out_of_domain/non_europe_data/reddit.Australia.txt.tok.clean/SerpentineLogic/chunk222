  i do n't get it . 
  is this some sort of ` dae entitlement ' meta-troll thing ? 
  ccp falcon 's been in the news a lot , lately ~, 
  buy a used ps3 unless you 're made ofmmoney . 
  or wait until fan fest in case it goes cross platform, 
  i think it should be a standard part of all events that large faction standing losses accrue for attacking named npcs . 
  in essence , a live event is a level 5 storyline mission and players should treat it with a similar level of respect . 
  if live events are to be taken seriously , they need serious repercussions , not just serious rewards . 
  ( ps i know loot is a lot easier to hand out , but lp is probably more appropriate for the thousand also-rans who did n't get the killing blow ),

  disability pension is hardly living the good life . 
  for the snarky comments . 
  ps you 're welcome . 
  manually setting standings might be debatedly interference , but setting some flags on the npcs to cause faction hits like mission rats definitely is not interfering . 
  sarmatiko picked up a prize . 
  but seriously , good to see the new style of live events working well . 
  please put in more foreshadowing , we get a real kick out of it . 
  i admit to a certain amount of dalliance with proximity mines ; they especially punish the multiple-repper madrugar setups you see around . 
  i have health insurance because the extra taxes for not having it are getting expensive . 
  bonus points if it 's also at the ere * bus station * . 
  i 'm not too proud to [ admit to title-trolling ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/1ahxnk/ccp_punkturis_delivers/ ) . 
  oh , amarr logistics is also pretty nice . 
  the extra equipment slots are quite handy . 
  engineering degrees in australia are n't ratified unless you have enough work experience ( ` vacation practice ' ) . 
  last time i checked , it was 18 weeks spread throughout the course of the degree , which works out quite well at 6 weeks at the end of years 1 , 2 , and 3 , leaving you ready to immediately start work as a graduate at the end of year 4 . 
  this vacation practice is paid at some percentage of what a ( graduate ? ), 
  engineer 's salary would be at that workplace . 
  this ensures, 
  1 . undergrads can afford to get work experience , and they get paid a decent amount of money, 
  2 . undergrads get to see how the business operates and build relationships, 
  2 . businesses get graduates that are n't completely useless, 
  1 . businesses might get a relationship with good undergrads and be their first pick when they get their degree . 
  tldr it helps if your industry has a professional association that is n't terrible . 
  the trick to the foreign worker problem is to grow their economies to the point where they are n't so cheap . 
  already india is n't so ridiculously good value for software development , especially when you factor in the quality issues due to lack of oversight .

  i think you mean * recall link * ~, 
  oh , so that 's why res has you pegged as ' i herd you liek clones ', 
  the bad thing is that hooking it up to the eu ets would make it work worse . 
  the eu is a hotbed of corruption ; this extends to fake carbon credits , which is why the price on carbon is stupidly low there . 
  hooking it up will help out business , but kill off our domestic , actually-working-not-fakingi-it offset programs . 
  ** tips fedo **, 
  there 's also pvp [ skill suggestions ] ( http://imgur.com/a/746my#0 ) that the various alliances put out . 
  while it will likely be a while before you can hold your own in a 1v1 fight , there are a number of roles in a gang vs gang engagement where newbies excel . 
  it got out on probation . 
  you can get ` what-used-to-be-considered-100 % - refine ' in high sec after the change , but null sec stations will be able to get somewhere up to 20 % more minerals from ore than you can . 
  you could also be an offline pos broker . 
  * player a comes to you with a location of a pos that 's offline, 
  * you pay them some money ( not a lot ), 
  * player b comes to you wanting the location of some offline pos towers to blow up for loot/killmails/need the spot to anchor their own, 
  * player b gives you money , you give them a location, 
  * when they blow it up , you give player a a bit more money .
