  try not to reuse variables like ` input ' . 
  depending on your coding style , you probably do n't need that variable at all ; just go ` verificationcode = scan.nextline ( ) ; ', 
  as indicated , putting lots of code in main ( ) is not good oo style . 
  you would have lots of methods in evemonitor , like methods like, 
  * parsekeyid ( input ) - i note you 're not handling strings that do n't parse to integers, 
  * parseverificationcode ( input ), 
  * getaccountstatus ( keyid , verificationcode ) to encapsulate all that messy api-related try/catch stuff, 
  * calculateremainingdays ( datetime in ) ( hint , check out days.daysbetween in the joda library because if you need to strip data from a string representation of a joda object , you 're probably doing something wrong ), 
  to be fair , vanity stuff usually does cost stupidly unrealistic amounts of rl dollars , otherwise it would n't be attractive to pose in . 
  sure , no problem . 
  does n't the address show up in google maps ? 
  ok , well i 'll do what i can . 
  to be fair , his aussie accent is pretty strong . 
  if you 're going to pony up with some cash , you 'd want the [ full-on effects ] ( https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/armour-effects ) . 
  personally , i 'd love some kind of blue laser rifle , or a back banner with ` free hugs ' written on it for my logo suit . 
  well , the exchange rates have fallen through the floor . 
  it used to be that 1 dust isk was worth ~ 5.7 eve isk . 
  these days , you 're exceptionally lucky to get parity and it 's still heading south . 
  fenrir :, 
  * shield : 5,625 hp, 
  * structure : 100,000 hp, 
  * 80m/s, 
  * fastest , most agile hauler ( this makes a big difference btw ), 
  * shield : 5,313 hp, 
  * structure : 120,000 hp, 
  * 65m/s, 
  * most structure , middle-of-the-road otherwise, 
  providence :, 
  * shield : 5,000 hp, 
  * structure : 112,500 hp, 
  * 70m/s, 
  * most armour , middle of the road , looks sexiest, 
  * shield : 6,000 hp, 
  * structure : 106,250 hp, 
  * 60m/s, 
  * most cargo capacity , freaking slow , often mistaken for a hard drive . 
  personally , i like the fenrir because it hauls a fair bit faster , but who knows what will happen once freighters get rig slots . 
  i have a lot of respect for hans in particular . 
  i think it 's no coincidence that he stopped blogging about dust about 6 months ago and clammed up . 
  i strongly urge you to use your gap year ( between high school and uni ) to backpack around uk/europe and/or canada , check out the places , see some cool things , meet some strangers and have some fun . 
  for bonus points , go somewhere in the developing world , too ( cambodia etc ) , to get some perspective . 
   ` cunt ' is used regularly in public and is not always a bad word . 
  results may vary wildly if you try this in polite company . 
  another guy on the forums is offering one eve isk for *** ten *** dust isk . 
  ouch . 
   shows the confidence people have in dust right now , 
  i think it 's probably the realisation the ccp is incredibly unlikely to let dust players transfer their mountains of isk to legion . 
  you 're willing to give him a billion dust isk for one hundred million eve isk ? 
  i 'll do it for 101m . 
  i just like arbitrage . 
  would prefer it to be a variant of salvaging . 
  i 'd rather wash my neighbour 's car . 
  and i * hate * my neighbour . 
  perhaps ... a salvaging [ escalation ] ( https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/escalating_encounters ) ? 
  tools of assassination . 
  how appropriate . 
  valkyrie is a dogfighting game with a small progression system . 
  it 's not really meant to be an mmo ( or at least , any more than bf4 is ), 
  yeah you could just use jackson or whatever to parse it . 
  so why not have a parse method on each node type ( use a common interface or parent class ) and then you do n't care what type it is ? 
  just loop through all tokens calling token.parse ( ) . 
  if things get messy in the node or there 's common code , extract the logic via composition and it can be a strategy pattern . 
  that 's actually very much like the age of sail , where ships of the line would literally line up ( either line abreast or line astern ) and manoeuvre to cross the enemy 's t etc. 
  except in 3d , you 'd have ships of the wall instead of ships of the line . 
  i 'm okay with this . 
  i 'd wonder what his trick was . 
  why would it ? 
  it 's like the only thing dust has going for it . 
  tldr ; a thing is good , so it should n't exist . 
  ps it 's not as good as null sec , and it takes a * lot * of effort to keep dust districts . 
  i would read a lot of books , just like when i was a kid . 
  smart phones and reddit were designed for those 3 am baby settling sessions . 
  just be sure to add a colour adjuster app like f.lux so you can get to sleep afterwards . 
  very different to [ htfu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgvm7av1o1q\u200e ) . 
  [ please no . 
  that 's an * enterprise * - level reference there . 
  there 's [ more isk ] ( https://eve-central.com/home/tradefind_display.html?qtype=systems&amp;newsearch=1&amp;fromt=30000142&amp;to=30002510 ) to be made . 
  are you using an ide ? 
  generally , when one uses eclipse or idea , any usage of libraries in the project have autocomplete popups based on the javadoc in their source files . 
  edit : looking at that library , though , it 's full of default/generated javadoc so it 's not you , it 's them . 
  but apply a discount for the lower policing costs . 
  but then apply another surcharge for the cost of pot license compliance and quality control . 
  about half the positions are in shanghai , which makes sense - what else are you going to do with the \u00a5 you get from serenity server ? 
  i would pay large sums of money to have a hedgehog as a pet . 
  the abbot point coal facility that 's in the news is designed to meet the ship loading needs of the galilee basin 's thermal coal reserves . 
  since the price of coal dropped , everyone has pulled out of tendering for its construction , except adani and gvk ( the indian companies left with large chunks of the coal mining rights to the basin after gina sold it to them and moonwalked away ), 
  given china 's push to reduce ( thermal ) coal needs and build train lines everywhere , it 's likely they 'll become ( opportunistic ) net exporters of coal in the next few years instead of a major importer like the last decade . 
  given that india also has reserves of thermal coal but is just too corrupt/unwilling to build the rail lines to transport it where it needs to go , the demand floor for thermal coal is n't looking good . 
  oh , and that 's ignoring the carbon costs of coal power generation . 
  tldr ; outlook not so good for coal . 
  ccp seems to give employees a fair bit of mobility . 
  worth a try . 
  both sides are n't coming out looking good from this . 
  props to noir for gifting a few pocos to third party players they respect , simultaneously getting some good karma , and making gevlon out to be the bad guy if he tries to take them back . 
  then again , according to his ` fuck goon ' policy , we would n't try to take them back anyway . 
  yes , 10/10 is ideal , unless it 's perfect me at a lower me level than that ( e.g. 
  small rigs etc ), 
  at the very least , getting ships to 1/1 will save you a bunch of time post-june should you need to whip some up to make t2 versions or whatever . 
  ammo blueprints will be absurdly quick to research after the change , so probably not worth doing anything with yet . 
  not sure , but 1/10 is the safest bet .
