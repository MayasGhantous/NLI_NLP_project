  depends how many blueprints you have . 
  do them to perfection if you can . 
  start with an app that reminds you via notification when you need to take out the trash . 
  then add geo location to work it out automatically for anyone on your street . 
  then find some data to work it out anywhere in your city . 
  it 's been done before but it 's a good thing to start with . 
  have you considered some theory books , or taxonomy ? 
  martin fowler has some good books describing from first principles what certain things are . 
  refactoring is one i recommend , but there are more hands on books like clean code , and more theoretical ones like domain driven design and head first design patterns that are useful to avoid reinventing the wheel . 
  worked for me just now ... 
  an important part of enjoying sand box games is setting goals then striving for them . 
  for instance , here 's [ mine ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/2012-industry-goals/ ) from a couple years back . 
  not the capital ships because it was just too much isk outlay . 
  the invention job one i stopped at seven hundred because it was just too astoundingly tiring . 
  the rest of the goals i smashed pretty well . 
  i did follow up after all . 
  yeah it should be a massive shake up . 
  and yet you need a kestrel to make a manticore and it would be regrettable to resort to an unreserved blueprint . 
  so , they all move to the code bazaar ? 
  everyone needs enough sql to not embarrass themselves . 
  the intel i heard was that it was a big push from ccp pr team . 
  if so , it was still an inelegant presentation of the legion idea . 
  whoop whoop, 
  valkyrie has announced support for both , which implies it will be launched to both pc and ps4 , so a comparison of the * same game * on different vr headsets is quite appropriate . 
  cpm elections were supposed to be held before fanfest . 
  then it was changed so the campaign would start after fanfest . 
  then dust got hospitalised , so all bets are off . 
   is a first person shooter the best alternative to piloting massive space ships or flying a vr fighter in new eden ? 
  it 's the logical choice . 
  * eve -  ships -  navy, 
  * valkyrie -  planes -  air force, 
  * legion -  boots -  army, 
  there 's a few people who suggested an rts , but mmos do n't really do it that way . 
  after all , from a certain point of view , eve is the same as homeworld , just with each player flying one ship . 
  nothing if the mods ban him . 
  or perhaps you 're pretending to be a new player and are not looking for a trial but you 're testing whether there 's a bot checking for buddy words ? 
  message the mods ? 
  sadly if you 're getting messages instead of comment replies , subreddit mods might not be able to do much . 
  i see there 's a separate thread full of people trolling the bot . 
  it 's the deceptive conduct that annoys me . 
  stuff that is cheap and slow but in-demand will be worth a lot more once the kronos changes come in , due to higher [ cogs ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/09/cogs.html ) . 
  [ r.a.m.s ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/11481/0/5/0/5 ) . 
  are 25 % margin but low isk per hour ( maybe 40k isk/hour/assembly line ) . 
  however , low isk/hour is acceptable to new players because it 's also low outlay . 
  look into it . 
  trickle down economics . 
  why not choose a pirate faction that suits your fancy , then train the racial ship types you need to get access to them ? 
  i changed my ratings on stuff because there 's actually a chance of big-ticket stuff being done . 
  sometimes you ca n't afford your dreams . 
  i would like to work for ccp too , but not when it represents a 70 % pay cut . 
  is n't there already eve dust and whatever stuff over on cold front ? 
  as a dabbler in mma , how do you think you compare to [ ccp games ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/press-releases/eve-of-destruction-pits-ccp-developers-in-brawl-against-world-class-mma-fighter-at-eve-fanfest/ ) vs [ gunnar nelson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plifyl4cgju ) ? 
  yeah , [ a while ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/1m8xp2/ccp_zulu_arnar_hrafn_gylfason_leaving_ccp/cc6vt9q ) . 
  the bot runs on feeds . 
  i have n't seen ccp make a dev blog with ` oh hey these are all the youtube videos we just put up ' so until that happens we 're stuck with spam . 
  generally people start with a secure can or a cloaked orca alt . 
  killed some customs offices , gearing up to evict a corp from dust . 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  find the districts they own , send clone packs to initiate battles , drop orbitals from an eve fleet , repeat . 
  i recall an article that said that anything above 50m usd is pointless unless you plan on giving it away . 
  bring three oxen . 
  e-war ? 
  especially the way the chinese do it , boiled , peeled then [ marinated in soy sauce ] ( http://appetiteforchina.com/recipes/soy-sauce-eggs ) . 
  but seriously , take extra water . 
  rtm ? 
  sounds like a tag on pornhub . 
  but seriously , i think it would not be acceptable . 
  crypto coins may not be money , but they are transferrable assets rather than services . 
  so , just like you ca n't trade your eve character for gold bars or playstation network gift cars , you ca n't trade them for doge coins . 
  i do n't even think jester is contemplating that . 
  in fact , the main thrust of his argument is that even those who do sub , most end up playing it like a theme park , which ccp will never be able to cater to . 
  so , given that you have only a certain amount of development time per year , should you spend 95 % of that on catering to existing subscribers , or carve off a good chunk ( say , 20 % ) devoted to getting proto-carebears into player corporations etc ? 
  hell , i do n't care if they want to get into a mission-running corporation , as long as it 's run by humans and there 's actual people in the corp channel . 
  do n't forget heavy sarcasm specialization v, 
  no , you 're paying for the result , which is coin . 
  that kind of mining is n't an eve-related service though . 
  to get back to your other example , you ca n't get someone to make a web page for your rl business with eve isk , but you can get someone to whip up a page for your eve corp. 
  check the #evedev irc channel while you 're at it . 
  great for midnight q&a sessions with someone in another timezone . 
  `` america . 
  [ love it , or leave it ] ( http://www.grunt.com/america-love-it-or-leave-it-bumper-sticker ) . 
  definitely do n't hang around to make it better . '', 
  please find it and post to / r/australia, 
  paired exploration is good too . 
  two scanners clear out signatures twice as quickly , and you can both be ready to grab loot when the hacking is successful . 
  there should be more of this type of posts , imo . 
  that may be from manually ctrl-a , ctrl-c on the fleet list and inputting it that way . 
   but , no one is claiming heroin has any health benefits . 
  well , heroin converts to morphine when injected so i think the medical benefits are pretty clear . 
  sure , it 's not ` medical grade ' , but neither is a random bag of weed . 
  i just got to this on the weekend . 
  i do like some things about this :, 
  * clearer grouping of stuff ( logistics equipment go with logistics suits , heavy weapons go with heavy suits etc ), 
  * good that certain skills become separate unlocks : e.g. 
  `` basic shield extenders '' , then `` advanced shield extenders '' , then `` prototype shield extenders '' which makes it a lot clearer what you get when you 're browsing the skill tree . 
  * good that the ` basic/advanced/proto ' suit progression seems to be removed , and once you get a suit you get the best version of it, 
  meh things :, 
  * locking weapon unlocks to the suits they 're iconic to . 
  yeah , okay i 'm sure it 's good for the newbies to get the weapons their suit is best with , but i also do n't necessarily want to train minmatar heavy just to unlock hmgs . 
  then again , maybe i should harden the fuck up .
