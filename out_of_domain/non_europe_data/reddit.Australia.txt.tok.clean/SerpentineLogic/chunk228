  * dropsuits being free . 
  this i can go either way for , but if , as ccp z says , most of the cost of a suit will be in the modules rather than the suits themselves , then i can live with it . 
  things that i do n't like :, 
  * handwaving over the eve economy aspects of the progression . 
  i know it 's early days , but the salvage -  sell -  get shot cycle does n't seem to have any room for industrialists . 
  note , however , i could be way off base because the rig market in eve works in s similar way . 
  tldr ; [ need more to decide ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uns6aod.jpg ) .

  so , they devised a way to avoid having to ask kids to hover hand in photos . 
  at uni , the engineering department used to have many events with the nursing department , just to get the gender ratios a bit more balanced . 
  of course , it did n't make the engineering students any more attractive to women , but at least they tried . 
  it 's not * terrible * . 
  perhaps you could elaborate on what you will use it for ? 
  i 'll assume you 're using it for running missions or killing npcs , since it does n't have a warp disruptor and you probably ca n't afford to replace it often . 
  i encourage you to remove one nano and replace it with a damage control . 
  newbies often need the extra hull buffer that a damage control provides due to not realising when things go south and needing to extract in a hurry with shields down . 
  i also encourage you to pick up some rigs ; the various shield resistance rigs are quite cheap , even if you ca n't afford core defence field extenders ( which are more often used in pvp ) . 
  your capacitor is probably a bit weak , what with having a micro warp drive as well as a shield booster . 
  do you often need to run the mwd , or could you get away with an afterburner instead ? 
  ( there 's no wrong answer here - either strategy works ), 
  similarly , you may find a capacitor booster or shield boost amplifier will allow you to repair your shields more efficiently or longer than the mixed extender/booster combo . 
  however , if it works for you , keep at it . 
  also , get some drones . 
  drone skills will be changing , so [ prepare now ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=4431589#post4431589 ) . 
  [ 108k in jita ] ( https://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=31754 ) . 
  an em and thermal rig is probably all you 'd want , since you already have two tech 2 hardeners . 
  of course , with higher resists you could try taking off one of the invulns for a shield boost amp or cap booster ... , 
  tldr ; dns_black and kane spero name their swords . 
  basically everyone that spero kicked out joined general tso 's alliance today . 
  so you * are * poes alt after all . 
  you 'd be surprised the number of start ups at surfers paradise , most of which are full of ex sydneysiders after r some sun . 
  so you know how much fucking iron ore we have . 
  actually gina sold all her holdings in the bowen basin months ago . 
  they 're going with a not-five-levels system . 
  it might still use sp , nobody knows until the q&a session with ccp z some time in the next 2 weeks . 
  apparently there 's a grr jester contingent ever since erotica1 . 
  i think the point is that , while the whole 5-level skill training thing is fine for skills in eve , which all give a benefit for each level trained , with level 1 unlocking all relevant hulls , dust was designed with a lot stupider progression , with this shitty mix of dead skills like drop suit command , gate-style skills like active scanner operation that do nothing except allow access to higher tier items , bonus skills like drop suit electronics , and half-gate , half-bonus skills like shield extension . 
  legion seems to be doubling down on gated skills , presumably because they 're not really interested in tiericide the way the eve devs are . 
  it 's not necessarily wrong , it 's just a different model . 
  heck , you can still do the tiered progression using unlocks , e.g. 
  standard-grade assault rifles unlock for 6000 sp , but advanced assault rifles unlock for ( whatever it would cost to get level 3 in assault rifles skill in dust ) . 
  it 's just that having three unlocks for what used to be one skill is a lot easier to show in a graphical manner . 
  i think he 's posing the question and not answering it ( he loves doing posts where he asks a question then answers it the next day ) . 
  i suspect that his opinion is that it 's definitely worth spending effort attempting to turn solo players into players-in-a-corporation , at least while there are easy wins to be made . 
  i wrote a [ few posts ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/tag/planetary-conquest/ ) about the state of the heath , before it got all too depressing . 
  fact is , just like eve , there 's no incentive for top teams to actually wage war , compared to drinking from the isk fountain . 
  in addition , there 's not really any way to break the status quo , because the player-capped matches mean you 'll always be facing the best 16 the enemy can field or rent using their isk reserves , while you 're stuck with 120 clones until you can take a district . 
  what 's worse is that you ca n't rely on eve support , because , unlike fw , orbitals are available for war points in pc . 
  so , the battle for territory has effectively stagnated for the last three months or more , and it 's not looking good for the rest of the year . 
  i think everyone avoids pvp when they 're not ready . 
  i think care bears are the ones who get upset when that pvp happens , instead of shrugging it off as the cost of playing the game . 
  zainou ` deadeye ' small hybrid turret sh-603 is about 300k isk . 
  probably a 3 % hull implant , but the rest are n't really cost-effective . 
  imo , frigate pvp is at two levels : cost-effective fits , and balls-to-the-wall , high-grade-crystals extravaganzas . 
  ccp does n't release mod tools for any game connected to the eve universe . 
  they 're available for war points * as well as * via eve players . 
  it still makes zero sense . 
  i will be lucky to use half my sp cap this week . 
  how so ? 
  [ yes .

  nice . 
  nulli is red, 
  goonswarm is blue, 
  but they get their rocks off, 
  violencing you, 
  the idea is to keep things secret so other countries have to spend a lot of effort learning the secret . 
  that leaves more time for you to protect the really secret bits . 
  drones are a lot like attack helicopters . 
  they lose to aircraft , but they loiter around in the sky , blowing up stuff on the ground when required . 
  cool . 
  according to [ tarigal 's philosophy on passive income ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-philosophy-of-passive-income/ ) :, 
   eve is not just about making isk , but knowing how to lose it well . 
  i would extend that philosophy to life , as well . 
   if you make all your isk doing boring shit that you eventually come to hate , that isk grows exponentially in value because you will want to avoid doing the boring shit again . 
   establishing passive income solves [ this issue ] as the pilot is now making isk with a positive personal value . 
  isk will no longer have a negative personal value associated with boring work . 
  this is particularly relevant to dust and legion . 
  in dust , there 's a sad mix of pay-2-not-wait gear , mixed in with some kind of badly-implemented vanity drop suit thing that 's only really available to show off in the war barge . 
  if ccp took the long-term approach , then p2nw items would be separate from skins , and the skins would be stupidly cheap , because they * must * be stupidly cheap or they just wo n't be used . 
  makes , sense , since that 's basically what it is . 
  i especially like the bit where they point at you , and you know they 're thinking ` you . 
  you die first . '', 
  i saw them in a chinese restaurant once . 
  then again , i know the owner , and i suspect she was just pandering . 
  when my wife 's family goes to a chinese restaurant , they do n't order off the menu . 
  and then i look like an idiot when i go to a chinese restaurant and try to order the same things , not knowing the chinese names for them . 
  `` i 'd like some pork squares and tofu with the prawn on top , oh , and some pork all cut up with the sugar . '', 
  do you at least get sweet and sour pork with pineapple ? 
  i get that , and cherish it . 
  however , there 's also the fact that sp gain in dust is just terribly grindy so there 's a lot of psychic pain involved in making bad decisions . 
  in fact , there 's a point to be made that narrow skills like z seems to be suggesting actually make it more painful , because if you do n't like assault rifles , you 're shit out of luck ( compared to eve , where the same skill would probably cover all hybrid and rail weapons ), 
  well you certainly wo n't in australia either . 
  just keep reading this subreddit and you 'll see articles about it soon enough . 
  it 's a subcultural thing .
