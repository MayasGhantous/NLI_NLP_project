  i think you mean null . 
  and fyi most blaster ships preload null . 
  it 's still suboptimal . 
  you shoot them a few times with null while you close , because otherwise you 're wasting damage . 
  only when you 've tackled them and are within 4km do you switch ammo . 
  it 's only a 5 second delay . 
  shortest iama ever . 
  & nbsp ; ^ thx & nbsp ; tho,

  at present , capacitor recharge is not stacking-penalized . 
  income per unit of ** : effort : ** : incursions . 
  if you remember your account details , there is a ` plex 4 hours ' option that allows you to resub for free for four hours . 
  it 's designed so that you can login , then use your existing isk reserves to buy a plex on the market and get 30 days added to your account , but you can use it to check out your character and use the eve api to update evemon instead . 
  why would it go up a bunch ? 
  screw exporting it ; if i had a crapload of tritanium in nullsec , i 'd make maelstroms or capital ships . 
  still waiting for capital mining lasers to put on a capital mining barge . 
  grabbing crotches : not ok . 
  reddit has a well-known literal bias . 
  i read recently that the sulfur emissions of bunker fuel were not so bad for aquatic life , especially in the deep sea . 
  ( btw bunker fuel is really yucky stuff ; it 's the oil equivalent of vegemite and outside of running ships on it , it does n't have many uses ), 
  they also use micro auxiliary power cores fitted to rookie frigates instead of schlepping replacement cyno frigates around the galaxy . 
  i heard that . 
  seems like a good deal for the canadians , but lousy for the icelandic economy in the long term . 
  on the plus side , we can call everyone in iceland ` canadian pets ' . 
  joke 's on you !, 
  i self-destruct them first . 
  nice stats ; lacking analysis . 
  needs moar jester . 
  ships already swap fuel when they enter territorial waters of many countries ( including the us ) . 
  incidentally , running on diesel also ruins their cost-per-mile efficiency . 
  interestingly , while south-east asians eat a lot of peanuts , they have a lower incidence of peanut allergy than westerners . 
  aside from any genetic reason for this , the main difference is that , in the west , peanuts are roasted , while in the east , they 're usually boiled . 
  there 's a study ( edit : [ found it ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11398088 ) ) that tested the difference and found :, 
   ** conclusion : **, 
   the methods of frying or boiling peanuts , as practiced in china , appear to reduce the allergenicity of peanuts compared with the method of dry roasting practiced widely in the united states . 
  roasting uses higher temperatures that apparently increase the allergenic property of peanut proteins and may help explain the difference in prevalence of peanut allergy observed in the 2 countries . 
  tbh i 'd just fly a navy omen until then . 
  you might find enlightenment by gaining understanding of the [ amarr ship progression ] ( http://evefng.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/amarr-ship-progression.html ) . 
  mission rats , too . 
  can always put a t1 cloak on a magnate and scan that way . 
  you 'll need to reship to actually run an exploration site , but that holds true whether you 're flying a magnate or an anathema . 
  yes . 
  previously , belt and mission rats would spawn as , e.g. 
  x battleships and y cruisers . 
  all the cruisers would be the same type , and all the battleships would be the same type . 
  the idea of belt chaining is to kill all the rats in a belt until they respawn to ` the best ' possible bounty possible , which is three high-bounty battleship rats and a few frigates . 
  then , you kill the battleships only , and when you come back to the belt , those three high-value rats have respawned and you can kill them again . 
  now , it does n't matter what the rats used to be : the respawned battleships could be any type . 
  this removes the possibility of cultivating the best rats , which lowers the isk/hour of the ~ ~ bots ~ ~ players who belt rat . 
  with regards to missions , it wo n't make as much a difference , but the rats will likely be more of a mix of long - and short-ranged ships , which may mean your fit becomes suboptimal . 
  really ? 
  i thought the current job market is pretty decent atm . 
  i find it unlikely that anyone on failheap would be upset about this change . 
  yeah , find out what the ato thinks before asking your accountant . 
  if they 're being loose with the truth , you can catch them out . 
  anathema has twice the bonus to scan strength of a magnate ... 
  like i 'd believe * anything * someone from band of beavers says ... 
  eve should take the settings from your os ... 
  please update the op when you find out what 's going on tomorrow . 
  i was in the market for ion thrusters the other day and it turns out that they were retailing for three times build cost . 
  market manipulations like this happen all the time . 
  more like taking advantage of a mismatch between what a user of the eve client expects and what the client displays . 
  i 'm not saying it was n't clever , or that it was cheating , but like the margin trading scam , i do n't believe it should be possible to do . 
  you do know that musk is a perfume , right ? 
   not sure how i came across that ... 
  not sure if double entendre & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
   1 ) how much time do i need to spend to be on par with most other players ? 
  you 'd be surprised how little time you need to spend . 
  heck , i hardly login . 
  the key is to specialize . 
  it will be years before you can credibly mix it with the guys who are in supercapital ships now . 
  however , you can compete in frigate fights within a few days or weeks . 
  but if you spread your skill points too thin , you 'll be mediocre at everything . 
   2 ) what are some things i can do in eve ? 
  i know there 's a lot of things , but what are some things that stand out . 
  we have a [ chart for that ] ( http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ ) . 
  i like owning an entire moon . 
  it 's pretty neat . 
   3 ) what 's the deal with plex ? 
  how long does it take to earn enough in-game currency to get one ? 
  for a 6-month old specialized player running incursion fleets : about eight hours . 
  of course , trading or corporate infiltration do not require much in the way of in-game skill points , and are quite lucrative if you know what you 're doing . 
   4 ) what 's the community like ? 
  a big deal for me ... i have a very hard time with games like lol where players trash each other all the time . 
  conversely , i 've had good experiences with friendly gamers who play in good spirit . 
  eve revolves around the concept of player-run corporations . 
  just like football teams , you barrack for your own corp and all other corps are self-evidently inferior . 
  ( unless you 're in the 4chan corp , which is ** objectively ** inferior ), 
   5 ) what 's the future of the game like ? 
  it 's quite old , but it seems like there 's been constant activity re : the game , so i 'm wondering how thing will play out in the future . 
  it has been going since 2003 , with subscriber numbers rising each year ( only * just * , in the case of last year , due to some well-publicised derps by ccp that they have thankfully reversed ) . 
  if you last the first few months , you 'll realise why most eve players will happily keep playing for years . 
  in short , the game has legs . 
  note down how much ore you have . 
  go to eve-central . com and check what the prices are ( assume that what the ore sells for in jita is a benchmark price ), 
  put it on the market for close to that price . 
  verify using a calculator that when the ore is sold , you 'll actually have enough isk to buy a plex . 
  wait a period of time , or start a trial account to periodically check the sell order . 
  when it has all sold , create a petition to ccp customer service asking for another hours for plex attempt . 
  you 're in early au tz , then .
