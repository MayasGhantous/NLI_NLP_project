  ** tldr ; ** does [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osborne_effect ) sound familiar ? 
  right now ? 
  sounds like the kind of person my cousins date . 
  also , blueprint copies allow you to use all your manufacturing lines on the same thing , which is good in bursts but not as efficient in the long term as production from originals . 
  i have some spare component copies if you 're interested . 
  what time zone are you ? 
  generally you use six blueprints , or supplement with copies from the market . 
  and or use a tower to build them . 
  i might know a corp you may enjoy . 
  this deserves its own post . 
  at least we get to hit them with the clue bat before they make all the mistakes . 
  also , stuff like this is big fucking news compared to the usual stuff we see . 
  probably server-side , so it could be used for legion as well . 
  any client side changes cost money just to go through sony testing , so they will do as few of those types of updates as possible . 
  well , i quite like the [ skill back ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2164443#post2164443 ) idea . 
  so does ccp z , as it turns out, 
  poor steve . 
  then again , stupider mistakes have been made . 
  the number of tourists who travel to austria looking for kangaroos is staggering . 
  that 's 95 % stupid and 5 % devious . 
  well , such is life when you 're posting the words of csm 9 . 
  if it 's bad posting , that will reflect upon them . 
  there 's a reason he 's in my rss feed . 
  but seriously , it 's not 100 % stupid to give a new player something they ca n't use yet , to encourage them to stick around long enough to sub . 
  probably better to give a few free gifts when someone * does * sub , though . 
  gnosis does n't hook you into skill training so you can pilot it .

  lol and i just got a message from / u/xoxfaby about *** guess what *** .

   the inevitable problem will be when these piratey types figure out they can effectively take over a mission system and pop billion isk ravens all day long .

  my blog is where i talk * at * you , not * with * you . 
  * click [ here ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/0/12005/-4/5/-4/5 ), 
  * click on ` open calculator ' in the invention section, 
  * adjust sliders to match your skills, 
  * drag calculator up to the top of the page so you can see the total profit, 
  * click on the various decryptors to work out what the best choice is . 
  tldr the changes will make manufacturing more accessible by eliminating wait lists , but more costly in general . 
  blueprint research levels will be adjusted from a 0 -  infinity scale to a 0 -  10 scale , where old me1 -  new me5 , and old me10 + -  new me10 . 
  invest in manufacturing skills if you * want to * , not because of a patch . 
  most people do industry on another character , since they tend to be tied down to wherever their factories are . 
  newbie manufacturing tips ? 
  watch me [ outsource it ] ( http://eve-prosper.blogspot.com/2013/07/industry-for-newbros.html ) . 
  [ cool . 
  well , the t1 blueprint will help a bit ( e.g. 
  to build the vexor in the ishtar list of materials ) but wo n't help much with the ishtar bpc material level ... 
  well , invention skills determine whether your invention attempt even works , but yeah , the production efficiency skill still matters and should be trained to 5 before you start manufacturing tech 2 stuff . 
  i used to do something similar in the nalvula pocket , although i would bring i 'm some complementary p1 so each of the p1 planets could produce some p2 on the sly . 
  that left more factories on the p3 planet , i think i was running five robotics factories full time . 
  4 % is pretty good . 
  the layout for the p1 planets is an extractor , port and lots of factories , although you can go for a silo and or a single p2 factory if you want to extend the capacity . 
  the p3 planet was three ports and about twenty factories . 
  one port with two p1 , the second port with the other p1s and the third receiving the p2 with factories turning it into p3 . 
  assault scram does n't overheat unless you 're really spraying and praying . 
  it does n't need an amarr assault suit . 
   as i 'm seeing a number of spambots around the internet latching onto things like this i will require anyone who gives me a link to post an ms paint drawing of the veldnaught humping an asteroid . 
  this is glorious . 
  tried running a ratting op , rather than a roaming op ? 
  get together a few people and hit a hard anomaly or exploration site ? 
  disable gatekeeper . 
  it not only prompts you before installing unsigned apps , it cuts off unsigned downloads after a few gig , with * hilarious results !, 
   do any of you solely use team speak or skype to play eve with people or is typing with other players the best way to communicate ? 
  approximately all of us ? 
  ( barring stuff that the client supports better , like dragging names into channels etc ), 
  incidentally , why is there not a / r/navebewbies subreddit full of pictures of nuns ? 
  make it so . 
  although , he did get a deanship so he got a promotion out of it , at least . 
  i think you 'll find that you 'll need six to eight basic factories just to keep up with the p0 output of a single ten-head extractor ( assuming 48k yield ) , so there is n't a lot of room left for another extractor for the other p1 . 
  i strongly suggest p1 on four planets , and 19 factories +3 spaceports on the barren fifth planet . 
  after all , low sec means low import taxes so why not use it ? 
  it 's called availability bias . 
  it 's only 2 % in the us . 
  it 's [ considerably higher ] ( http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mythearwax.html ) in other countries . 
  if we let everything dinosaur-related into this subreddit , it would quickly [ head south ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j5ccqsr.jpg ) . 
   firstly , i feel it should be said that i will not dispute this decision , and i will stand behind ccp for making it . 
  since my removal was been announced , there has been speculation as to the reason . 
  i am writing this post to hopefully clear that up . 
  it is not my intention to come across as a hero , inspire outrage , or come off as trying to make myself a martyr , or anything silly like that . 
  my removal was a consequence for my actions , and i have no intention of doing anything but take full responsibility for that . 
   the simple truth is , i have always been a passionate person . 
  this passion is what led to my being chosen for the cpm in the first place , and is ultimately what led to my `` downfall `` as a council member . 
  i have never been afraid to step on toes to express my opinions and concerns . 
  my passion sometimes got the better of me , and in expressing myself there were times when i crossed the line . 
  many times over the last year i have told ccp that the manner in which they communicate is much more important than how often they communicate . 
  a lesson which i had failed to heed myself at times . 
  inexperience left me ill-prepared to interact with ccp on the level that was expected of us as a council , and because of this my approach to doing so was flawed from the start . 
   as a person i value honesty above anything else , and i expressed this honesty by voicing concerns with things ccp presented to us in a manner that was often more incendiary than necessary . 
  truthfully , i would have loved to have been a cheerleader and squealed with glee at everything ccp shared with us ... 
  but in thinking that it was the council 's job to be critical , i quickly found myself being the `` bad cop '' among the council and was typically the one who spoke out against things being presented over the course of the year . 
   i honestly did not like that i had become so cynical and pessimistic about something i love so much , and i yearned for the days ' past when i salivated with giddy excitement with every new bit of dust news ... and yet , this was something i could not do . 
  i could not smile and pretend things were fine when they were not . 
  it broke my heart to see and hear the things we had to discuss sometimes , and broke it further when i felt i had to rain on someone 's parade as they brought us an idea they were clearly excited about , only to hear myself and/or the other council members immediately reject or express serious concerns about that idea . 
   that is not to say that ccp did not come to us with amazing and exciting things , but the positive conversations unfortunately have little bearing on what brought us to where we are now and why i was dismissed from the council . 
  to clarify ; some have speculated that i went into a state of sheer nerdrage after fanfest , and this is what caused my dismissal . 
  this is not the case by any means . 
  while fanfest was an emotional and heartbreaking time for the entire council , much of what was presented to us before and after fanfest was in fact quite positive . 
  my single largest regret in all this is that i can no longer take part in those discussions anymore , many of which were truly exciting and brought back the hope i had once expressed so enthusiastically in the past . 
   in summary ;,
