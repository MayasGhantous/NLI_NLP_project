  it would turn into freighterpunchingwithfrigatesspillingcargoeverywhere.com, 
  i am okay with this . 
  are you done yet ? 
  well , you 're making a lot more of it ( and more is used in manufacturing ) , so your profit per hour should be similar . 
  obligatory timezone poast . 
  inevitable everyone-else-will-be-asleep rejection . 
  i just started shopping around for quotes this week ... 
   god that was like a hit of heroine, 
  instructions unclear ; got punched by wonder woman, 
  you 'll have to do your sums , but when i bought my first house , every dollar extra i put in the first year , saved me $ 1.70 in interest . 
  the roi of solar probably ca n't compete with that . 
  not gon na lie , that 's a prick of a loan . 
   may a thousand flowers bloom, 
  i understood that reference . 
  considered joint red vs blue ? 
  ( faction warfare probably is n't for you if you like a bit of mining on the sly ), 
  otherwise , there 's a new tech 2 venture that you might find interesting to ninja mining in low sec . 
  some people play games to escape the real world . 
  others sign up for a second job shooting red crosses that pays terribly . 
  minmatar commando still owns all . 
  commando power is mostly in the weapons available to them . 
  it is if your corp is full of aussies . 
  skills take longer to get ? 
  i dunno , dust is n't really set up to rake in the cash . 
  occasionally there will be triple skill point weeks , where if you plan on playing a lot it might be worth buying an active booster for ( 7-day booster is ~ $ 3.50 ) , but most of us do n't use boosters at other times . 
  so , you have n't explored [ other ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phimosis#surgical ) surgical options ? 
  ironically there 's a south american dust alliance that seems pretty active . 
  legion is more like ` dayz in space ', 
  teaser posts shit me . 
  fix it , xander . 
  you know you can buy dust isk from players in exchange for eve isk . 
  that 's news to the people still doing it on the dust forums . 
  it 's not space illegal . 
  try complaining in / r/evetech instead ? 
  yeah , the point is that you ca n't you your hmg skills when you 're running your scout fit , so there 's a cap on how much of your veteran-level sp pool you can apply at any one time . 
  pity dust does n't have a plex system :(, 
  the only silver lining is finding out about [ namamai 's blog ] ( http://namamai.wordpress.com ) . 
  it means that instant battles will cause salvage fields to be created , which you can go to afterwards and attempt to get salvage faster than the salvage drones . 
  tree fiddy . 
  interestingly , australia only accounts for 40 % of the world 's macadamia nut production . 
  that 's true on a number of levels . 
  well , he has a list of blogs on his side bar ; perhaps some will scratch your itch . 
  because all you need is more cyno alts or chain them . 
  the limit must also be on the pilot jumping in . 
  as i 've previously said , blogs are unashamedly for talking * at * people . 
  the eve servers restrict the bandwidth that each client can use to 28.8 k i.e. 
  literally modem speed . 
  so you 'll be * okay * . 
  is this when you mention you 're going to lose your fourth [ nyx ] ( http://themittani.com/features/event-flight-thousand-rifters-iii ) ? 
  once is carelessness ... 
  another successful op ? 
  i got mine from posting blue intel . 
  shipping fee to australia is 20eur , seems reasonable , as do the prices . 
  are you american or something ? 
  considering getting the messenger bag , actually . 
  i ca n't justify spending three thousand dollars on fanfest but i could manage one or two hundred on some swag i would n't be embarrassed to wear .

  how does your therapy regime compare to [ project walk ] ( http://www.projectwalk.com ) / [ walk on ] ( http://scia.org.au/walk-on ) ? 
  maybe amnesty international can hire the sas then . 
  [ this happened ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0iqbz5zpe ) six years ago , and the burning station became a [ tourist site ] ( http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/malkalen-ishukone-corporation-factory-station/ ) until they put out the fire about six months ago . 
  i guess they 've now finished the exterior as well . 
  told level : *** so *** . 
  in a pos ? 
  i 'm checking mining barge fits to see how transverse bulkheads work out . 
  [ so far , so good . 
  ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/ ), 
  but smaller because there 's not so many graphics changes compared to faction station skins + new ships + etc etc. 
  ore now refines to more minerals , so it 's about the same in high sec ( although you 'll need higher skills to reach the same level of efficiency ) . 
  however , in a pos , you 'll be able to refine a few percent more than that , and in a null sec station , you 'll be able to refine even higher . 
  in the most recent build , they changed the lock-on mechanic to lock one missile at a time , so you could glance at the enemy ship to get a single missile but you needed head tracking to lock on all five for a salvo . 
  this indirectly nerfed the dps of missiles , which coincided with a buff to guns to make the gameplay work a bit better ( minmatar guns also overheat and reduce their rof when you spam them , which encourages burst firing , so they 're serious about implementing depth of gunplay as well ), 
  it 's only a number . 
  yeah i think they realise how fortunate they are to be in the right place at the right time and are furiously attempting to not fuck up . 
  i have * no idea * what you mean . 
  \\* uploads new image furiously \\*, 
  valkyrie is at least a aa game . 
  nice analysis . 
  incidentally , 29.106 au is the average warp distance between two gates in high sec . 
  ca n't you drag a fitting into the quick bar ? 
  i believe [ xp3ll3d ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=164303 ) is running with that as part of his cpm1 platform . 
  we all saw on game of thrones what show boating gets you . 
  i guess the mackinaw ship skin supply has dried up . 
  there 's still three other freighter types you can use . 
  probably . 
  i mean , it 's not as if we do n't already know there 's cameras on the trains , but with the influx in foreigners , it 's probably best to, 
  * let them know the cameras exist , for privacy 's sake, 
  * advertise the fact that we have security cameras on trains , whee security !, 
  well , it was a lot easier to win back then . 
  or you get your degree then move overseas and never pay it off . 
  is this where we start saying le ? 
  well , i escaped a combat rifle that would have stun locked me so your argument is invalid . 
  i tend to contract them a set of +3 implants and the cybernetics skill . 
  btw namamai , faction bubbles are twice as fast to online after deploying . 
  [ and yet ... ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2014/06/obamas-war-on-coal-is-one-worth-fighting.html ), 
  as someone who once was tempted to run missions in syndicate , this saddens me . 
  yes . 
  \\ #booleanlogic, 
  may as well start in providence , then . 
  it 's one cyno away from high sec , and it 's easy to get into . 
  til lottery winnings in the us are taxed .
