  hell , unless provibloc got a lot more elitist lately , one expects they 'd be happy to see a random blackbird or whatever show up . 
  something like that , sure . 
  do n't forget transverse bulkheads . 
  fair enough , but are n't you spending the rest of the time ratting and otherwise earning isk anyway ? 
  something like [ this ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-04-at-9-23-33-am.png ) will give you some warning before your ship explodes . 
  note , however , that not much will save you if you 're mining afk in 0.4 sec systems . 
  that is the appropriate thing to do , yes . 
  caldari commando of whatever tier you want, 
  * sniper rifle of whatever tier or type you want, 
  * sl-4 rail rifle ( or magsec smg if you 're cheap ), 
  * either damage modules or shield extenders, 
  * nano hive of your choice, 
  it 's also good to have a scout suit with an uplink so you can respawn there after you get shot . 
  as a sniper , you might also like to put the minimum amount of skill points into flying dropships ( probably less than 150k skill points ) so you can reach high points . 
  iirc it was exactly terms like this ( or rejection thereof ) that differentiated bni from previous reddit-born corporations . 
  that 's interesting ; i recall them being a lot stricter on themselves back in the beginning . 
  as the saying goes , lie down with dogs ... 
  you try to dock , and a popup appears saying `` the docking fee at this station is 100k isk . 
  do you still want to dock ? '', 
  then you say `` yes god dammit i 'm being shot at by fifteen atrons '' and click yes and then you dock and are charged accordingly . 
  did you run out of active skill points in your pool ? 
  it resets to ~ 196000 every wednesday at downtime - after it runs out for the week , you 'll only gain 1 skill point for each war point you make , up to a limit of 1000sp per match . 
  generally , after i hit my cap , i modify my play style to ensure i reach the 1000sp cap each match . 
  this usually involves drop uplinks , nano hives and judicious use of nanite injectors to pick up a few extra war points . 
  [ problem ? 
  maybe this one ? 
  that 's why we 're * asking * . 
  you can choose any faction you want , using any ships you want . 
  x 3 is close , but not free , and not multiple players . 
  it 's not exactly solo , but prospects can be black ops bridged ... 
  are you just complaining about a second helping of ice cream ? 
  i think you need to have a word with yourself . 
  one of the best things about playing magic : the gathering was a new set of cards to shake up the metagame , every 3 months , like clockwork . 
  ha , i would love to see spawns fit in a sane manner  maybe just faction spawns ; players do like to mow down hordes of chaff . 
  dsts are n't really for null ; they 're for high sec or occasionally low-sec use . 
  with 4 active hardeners and a medium ancillary rep ( all overheated ) , you 're repping 2.7 k ehp per second for almost a minute . 
  i guess the idea is that you rep your way out of a tight spot if you get caught , but you do n't have the evasion of a blockade runner . 
  generally , on ships as slow to align as a dst , you 'd fit a micro warp drive ( or in a pinch , an afterburner , but it 's nowhere near as good ) . 
  a mwd provides 5x speed boost and cycles in 10 seconds . 
  so , pulsing your mwd will boost your acceleration enough to push you to the 75 % max speed you need to warp . 
  advanced shield extenders will be buffed in the next patch ( from 33hp to 50hp ) . 
  seems like a good place to stop if you have ultra-low skill points . 
  i 'm leaning towards no . 
  * dev blogs / in game news etc are ok to autopost because they 're : ccp :, 
  * csm blogs are okay because : csm : and also , if they 're bad at blogging , then reddit needs to know and will down vote accordingly . 
  i think picking up other stuff smacks of favouritism , so let 's not go there . 
   * your choice of occupation would also determine what skills you started with . 
  not only was there a wide variation of starting skills , but some skills were worth more sp than others -- a character could start the game with as little as 6,000 sp , or as high as 300,000 sp , depending on their choices . 
  while i acknowledge that it 's fundamentally unfair to have such a variation of skill points at character creation , i 'm actually okay with each bloodline and role choice giving you a small initial perk that is displayed when you are presented with the choice of bloodline at character creation , e.g. 
  you get caldari frigate and small hybrid turret ( as you 'd expect ), 
  * civire : you get evasive maneuvering i, 
  * deiteis : you get leadership i, 
  * achura : you get science i ( god , i dunno ), 
  etc etc etc. 
  call your credit card company . 
  lately , i 've been listening to the * frozen * soundtrack on repeat , a cappella with toddlers mangling the lyrics . 
  and before that , northern coalition owned the north , before white noise / northern coalition dot conquered it . 
  although , this guy 's music was linked from the ' a tale of internet spaceships ' trailer . 
  am really digging [ supernova ] ( http://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/ ) . 
  i ca n't get behind that . 
  the core part of the longevity of eve is not being permanently tied to character creation choices . 
  [ decide for yourself ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/ ), 
  sentry drones tend to survive longer . 
  yes , covert ops ships are cheap , try it out ( try in a tech 1 exploration ship if you wish ), 
  sorry , wrong time zone for my alliance ( s ), 
  i 'm playing the long game . 
  i can confirm this ; he said as much when i had a [ chat with him ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/a-wild-awox-appears/ ) in 2011 . 
  i have a python mine bpo . 
  i make a point to always carry one in my cargo hold ,

  drk industry planner is a lot better than prism . 
  it handles batches , allows you to assign wallet transactions to various projects so it knows what you 've bought , allows you to assign industry jobs to the project so you know what you 've made , and assign market sell orders or contracts so you know how much profit you made . 
  also , each time you use a bpo , it will learn the me and pe so the next time you need that item it remembers . 
  \\ #eightisenough, 
  depends how much time you want to spend on your alt . 
  trading is potentially more isk , but potentially more time spent as well . 
  pi is fairly low time investment and pretty-much guaranteed income , but the income is also capped ( you probably wo n't get more than about 10-15m isk per day unless you are serious about low sec pi processing in a zero-tax poco ), 
  that 's an intensely personal question and i do n't feel comfortable answering . 
  do n't forget the nerf to standard re damage ( although there 's a buff to prototype res ), 
  i believe it actually denotes [ house tyrell ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/house_tyrell ) .

  let 's get it started ( in here ), 
  personally , it 's probably better to commit to a 12-month subscription than to start a second account . 
  feel free to start a second character on the first account , though . 
  this thread is devoid of humour . 
  according to the spreadsheet , the damage used to be 1500 -  1500 -  1500 , but is now 1250 -  1500 -  1750 , and 1.5 seconds being added to arming time , with no changes to fitting . 
  what can you afford to lose ? 
  at this point , that 's probably going to be a frigate or destroyer , tops . 
  [ this type . 
  totally unlike the gold coast city council , then . 
   the brisbane council that governs a city of 1,000,000 + people is pretty good . 
  the adjoining logan council that governs a city of 300,000 is a little less sophisticated . 
  to be fair , * logan itself * is a little less sophisticated . 
  drk allows you to assign purchases and sales from contracts . 
  i thought autistic comments were mandatory in test .
