  there will probably be attempts to wind back regulatory oversight as part of this change , because if you have an opportunity , why * not * try one on ? 
  can you get someone to whip up an interactive version so i can wave my mouse over a bubble and know what it is ? 
  or the guy from [ dustcharts ] ( http://dustcharts.com ) maybe . 
  maybe because your alliance leadership is all test and goon alts ? 
  he also pissed off a bunch of people , which is the key component of his job so , well done that man . 
  poli pay is a piece of shit and i would never , * ever * use it because it would open me up to bank account fraud . 
  there 's no way in hell i 'm going to give someone my online banking details so it can log in automatically and transfer money . 
  bpay does n't give them kickbacks the way poli probably does . 
  what 's to ask about ? 
  my mouse hand is still nostalgic for chromosome . 
  given her age , that 's probably historically accurate . 
  you have an afterburner , they do n't . 
  you have the advantage . 
  disposal is a solved issue ; australia has some of the most geologically-stable locations to store radioactive waste ( and remember , the more radioactive it is , the faster it will decay away ), 
  that joh guy in queensland gives me the shits . 
  you 'd be surprised how many lamb hot pots in chinese restaurants are actually , or can be ordered with , goat . 
  goats do eat shrubs and bushes where sheep do n't though . 
  this can be a good thing , i think there 's trials using goats to clear out blackberry infestation in australia and kudzu in the usa . 
  i 'd do it the other way around . 
  have one character on each end . 
  mining/manufacturing ( set up jobs , go afk in a belt ), 
  hauling + trade ( buy stuff , deliver to manufacturer , pick up manufactured goods , fly back to trade hub and put them up for sale ), 
  well , we do have a regrettable and persistent problem with drunk people smashing beer glasses into other people 's faces , or punching them without warning . 
  i do n't know any er staff to tell me whether it 's as big a problem as the media says it is , but it certainly does happen . 
  evemail the guy behind eve droid and see what it would take to move pi to the top of his roadmap . 
  he is in wrote kapelle . 
  so , why were the clones scribbling 514 everywhere ? 
  it 's often the poster more than the post . 
  people get polarising reputations then have trouble with lighthearted posts being down voted because it 's unexpected . 
  at least they lead with ` sorry , but ... ', 
  goon scrawl federation ? 
  tate should take a fucking hint and retire while he can still walk . 
  let 's wait for episode three : ' i meant medal all along ', 
  i think he meant the one that sprung up around 2008 . 
  i do n't think australian hospitals can afford * not to * stock antivenin . 
  australian snakes have a tendency to bite multiple times , so you 're on a short clock if you get attacked by a snake . 
  i suspect this was abbott 's plan . 
  i 'm less certain about conroy , but there was a chance it was done to him as well . 
  taxes is a philosophical/organisational issue as well as a logistical one . 
  corp taxes makes it easier to administer a corporation from the top down , since it 's a bottom up wealth transfer . 
  some players have resisted alliance taxes for this very reason , since it then becomes too easy to have anaemic corporations and control everything from the alliance hq , which further centralises control ( via purse strings ) . 
  i 'm not going to get into that argument , but from a corp director perspective , corp taxes are essential to keeping it ticking over without resorting to spreadsheets and effort . 
  corp taxes on income via ratting is relatively uncontroversial , although there 's a point to be made that the corp is n't exactly helping you out with ratting so why tax it ? 
  pi taxes work well ( although it would be a kick in the pants to large poco holders to see pi taxes come in the form of a percentage of the pi , which would please me in a nasty way ) . 
  i do n't even see how corp taxes on mining would work ; i suppose there 's an avenue for taxation of pos refining infrastructure . 
  the big thing that appears to be missing from crius is corp taxation of pos research and manufacturing slots . 
  i have set corp fees on the various research towers so that at 90 % utilisation , the fees will pay for pos fuel . 
  without that , it would be annoying to fund : /, 
  besides google docs ? 
  the concord flair is a nice touch . 
  they 're all vanity colour schemes on quite inexpensive ships . 
  none of them are really suited to pvp combat . 
  the cat gps software is done out of brisbane , it 's pretty cool . 
  australians learned that in gallipoli . 
  is this the guy who the other ccp creators thought was a bit sociopathic ? 
  i think somerset said `` well , we could just steal everything , or we could let the site operate another six months and have the same amount of profit but still have the site running , so why bother ? '', 
  minmatar role players have asked for right click , free slave for years . 
  just use prototype cloaks . 
  generally , you 'd have one person doing the scanning and hacking , and the other person with a combat ship to do the combat sites . 
  i have seen a lot of tengu pairs in low sec during russian time zone , i suspect they 're making bank pulling deadspace invulnerability fields . 
  [ causality ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugplrpwvz0i ) , because it 's not about spaceships ; it 's about sending a message . 
  mining boosts from an orca provide somewhere north of 50 % faster mining . 
  that 's pointless for a solo miner or dual account ( why not just run 2 miners instead of 1 miner + orca ) but when there 's a dozen barges , it makes a lot of sense due to economy of scale . 
  so , that 's a big boost . 
  the second thing is that you can use different barges when you 're in a group . 
  solo , you might use retrievers or macks because they have a fuck-off ore hold so you only need to return to station twice per hour . 
  with orca support , you can live life on the edge and run a covetor or hulk , which mines a lot faster but has to jet can mine because the ore hold fills up in like two cycles . 
  the third thing is that you get a fair bit of safety in numbers . 
  sure , you 're a bigger target , but if you 've ever seen an ice belt there 's no shortage of targets anyway . 
  with corp support , suddenly you have shield gang links , a dozen extra people watching local , d-scan and on grid to give you warning , and if you 're lucky , then someone will hang around in an interceptor so you can sic 50 drones on anyone who tries to suicide gank you . 
  the fourth thing is that there 's probably one guy in corp who is an expert reprocessor so you do n't have to bust a nut training refining skills . 
  heck , they might even have a compression array in a tower , which you might not have access to if you were rolling solo . 
  as far as how much the mining corp takes , that 's wildly variable . 
  in the end , mining probably is n't huge income ( balls-to-the-wall covetor is 24.36 m ^ 3 per second , which mining massive scordite ( 202.80 isk/m ^ 3 ) only yields 17.8 m isk/hour ) , but it scales well , is relatively low-risk , and not especially taxing on your concentration . 
  as an australian , 45 % is north of 50 % . 
   or organ trail, 
  11 % lp tax for militias ? 
  after all that time in a super , he was probably out of practice with the whole docking/undocking thing . 
  ** ten \u00b7 den \u00b7 tious ** adjective \\ ten-\u02c8den ( t ) - sh\u0259s \\, 
  : strongly favoring a particular point of view in a way that may cause argument : expressing a strong opinion, 
  i do n't think that word means what you think it means . 
  low sec pi is pretty good with zero tax rate and one jump from high-sec , so you can buy in bulk from empire . 
  m8 he 's representing his constituency , what else did you expect . 
  yeah i saw that thing where nullarbor said ` why are there even corp taxes , you 're paying out of a corp wallet then into another wallet ? ', 
  the point is that ideally , we 'd pay from a ** player 's ** wallet into a corp wallet , rather than perpetuate the insanity that currently prevails . 
  op has already broken the first rule of freight club . 
  ex-members still count for the next 7 days or so . 
  if said t3 is expecting to be bridged , then they should have packed their cargo hold full of your fuel . 
  goddamn freeloaders . 
   and people are now impressed because one dev can do that on a somewhat consistent basis ? 
  comparatively , yes this is impressive compared to before . 
  um , you do know that the api pretends there were no siphons when it tells you how much is in your silos , right ? 
  i fixed the title precisely because that irked me . 
  will you blog about stacking penalties , and how target painters and core defence field extenders interact in unexpected ways ? 
  from what i recall , cdfe is + sig % , so when painted , the + sig is stacking penalised so it 's not actually much of a penalty any more . 
  rig drawbacks sometimes have strange interactions . 
  ( personally i suspect that rigs will soon have flat penalties and skill-based bonuses ), 
  oh , eve.apiverified.com . 
  there 's your problem . 
  you should have checked on eve.reallyapiverifiednoimserious.com instead .
