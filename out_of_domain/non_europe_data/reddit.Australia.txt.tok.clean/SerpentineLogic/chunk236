  transactions do n't go missing . 
  you were scammed . 
  i guess the ` one-shot deep space transport kill ' bug is somewhat related . 
  early retirement is your only option . 
  no it was n't ; it was donny osmond . 
  the roxette effect . 
  it 's not cantonese . 
  one way of looking at it is that the corporations gain a measure of the fame attributed to the pilot , just like accenture gains a measure of good-will as its consultants do their thing . 
  so , it does n't seem impossible that part of the goodwill generated by a faction warfare mission goes to the corporation itself . 
  [ english version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hog1evml8vs ), 
  i use scrams for static situations where enemies pop up from cover , and because i sunk a few million sp into them so why not . 
  so the idea is that one person ca n't do the same thing in two countries at the same time . 
  seems fair . 
  depends how many skill points you had . 
  it 's probably worth it . 
  hex u, 
  we loot salvage from salvage sites we find . 
  we < mumble mumble  to get weapons and equipment . 
  we use equipment to fight battles . 
  so far that 's all we know . 
  yes but this is not a comparison . 
  there 's one thing , and then there ' another thing , and both are very different . 
  the economy so far is looking like the wreck salvaging cycle from eve . 
  those questions have n't been answered yet ; wolfman is leaning towards a drone that you tell ` go salvage that thing ' and you then have to guard it until you deliver the salvage to a place where it can be safely stored . 
  at this stage , salvage spots are randomly-generated , but players are pushing for salvage fields to also spawn in the location of lobby matches so scavengers can hoover up all the debris . 
  i do n't think you realise how resistant america was to the introduction of seat belts back in the day . 
  verite rendition still posts on failheap . 
  latinum ca n't be replicated , hence why it 's valuable . 
  original content from tmdc ? 
  that makes a change . 
  we use viber . 
  it does n't have especially awesome moderation facilities , so if someone gives us the shits we kick him from corp. 
  if we were serious about eve-api integration ( which we ca n't really , because dust has no api keys ) , we 'd probably fork [ bni auth ] ( https://github.com/bravecollective ) and hook it up to jabber or whatever . 
   what is there for someone to do in this game who hates losing ships ? 
  what is the issue with losing ships ? 
  are you also sad when you play a card in uno , knowing that it is forever gone from your hand ? 
  plus, 
  i know . 
  not sure yet , but your location is in the top left , and there 's a map icon in the middle . 
  and that 's what it 's all about . 
  it 's * also * on a console , not * only * on a console . 
  this is why australia can not into gate camps . 
  problems with your erection ? 
  we can help you construct your shed !, 
  after a point , you 've already picked the low-hanging fruit so there 's a natural limit to the size of the investment pool . 
  however , there 's no indication that we 're anywhere near that limit , given that the pool basically started from zero . 
  what do you hope to achieve by posting this ? 
  [ four is where it really kicks in ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/stacking.png ), 
  i especially like the bit where you can dump your own harvester , pick up someone else 's full one , then leg it . 
  it ups the ante . 
  remember , this is not a mass-market event ; this is an elitist event . 
  logibro [ said ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2227800#post2227800 ) that if this event goes off well , he could easily run extra events for different weapon types ( e.g. 
  imagine throwing nyain-san 's modified core locus grenade ), 
  have you considered looking up the drake in [ isis ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-interbus-ship-identification-system/ ) and checking out the skills required for [ mastery ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/license-to-kill-certificate-overhaul/ ) ? 
  the two rules of freelancing policy decisions :, 
  be good at it, 
  do n't be not good at it, 
  something something cheaper . 
  it appears that i can not into maths . 
  ask a fleet mate to stay logged on as well ? 
  best to make it orbit the tower as well . 
  much harder to bump out . 
  playing an mmo did n't give you a clue ? 
  `` unscheduled maths lesson : how many times does fifty five go into seven ? '', 
  by now , it probably is again . 
  pioneered in australia , iirc . 
  the reverse centipede position . 
  apparently this warman guy just sees dollar signs . 
  paging / u/katrinat, 
  it will stick out further if it 's bumped . 
  maybe they 'll calculate based on buy price instead of sell price . 
  you reckon ? 
  with the nrds policy in play , surely it would have been mapped to hell and back already . 
  i think a good approach would be to choose regions that are, 
  * noteworthy/interesting for whatever reason, 
  * difficult for an unaffiliated player to scan down themselves, 
  this probably rules out all of npc null sec , unless you 're making a point ( e.g. 
  ` everyone says that syndicate income is bad , but look at all these moons ! ' ), 
  alternatively , just chat in local and make friends outside of corp. . avoids the unpleasantness of being safari 'd , and you still get pickup fleets for mining boosts . 
  * [ mining barges ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/ ) ( kronos edition ), 
  * [ exhumers ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/exhumers-in-kronos/ ), 
  so , taking an example ( 3-mining link hulk fit ) :, 
  * 28.68 m ^ 3 per second -  103248m ^ 3 per hour nonstop jet can mining, 
  * so , that 's 24.9 m isk/hour mining hedbergite in lowsec, 
  * or 20.8 m isk/hour mining scordite in high sec, 
  add 40 % for mining boosts , if available . 
  ... and the most pizza delivery job growth . 
  i ` mma let you finish but -  / r/evejobs, 
   here , you just irritate the locales . 
  en_au is pretty cranky to start with . 
  you should see / r/australia . 
  the political rage is palpable . 
  also , watching safari videos on youtube . 
  bonus points if you play it backwards so it turns into a reverse safari . 
  perhaps look at some of the corps that enter the syndicate competitive league tournaments ?

  or a ten year anniversary sword, 
  start by scanning 0.4 sec systems , you might get lucky . 
  not on a procurer ; it gets +5 % to shield hp per level of mining barge .
