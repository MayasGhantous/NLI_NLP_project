  yes . 
  only you can prevent ally mcbeal . 
  i ran a passive shield myrmidon in sansha space . 
  got jumped by a curse , he had to warp out because he could n't break my tank . 
  it 's either abc 4 kids or you have to turn the tv off on the weekends . 
  i 'm 100 percent certain that muslims and christians venerate jesus christ in very different ways . 
  it 's a core tenet of christianity that jesus * is * god , which other religions are willing to argue about . 
  like they need another plex sink . 
  have you considered using eveiskperhour ? 
  it 's windows only , though . 
  welcome to eve . 
  * http://theeveindustrialist.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/eve-isk-per-hour-part-2.html, 
  basically , it will [ tell you ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iesvxkz9e4w/uzboldivmgi/aaaaaaaaato/dvbvorwqbhi/s1600/manufact+list.png ) which of your blueprints is best to use , given various criteria . 
  they should be called bustboys . 
  hulks drop tech 2 salvage in addition to potentially three strips . 
  hell yes you can make money off them . 
  no , you 'll be fine . 
  post fit ? 
   yes there is a big push for more solar and wind energy in australia . 
  that 's not what the prime minister says :(, 
  stanwell has something like this ; i know there 's slurry ponds out the back . 
  it changes on tuesday . 
  yes . 
  anything restricted to 0.3 or less is changing to 0.4 or less . 
  a place i had work experience at , had ge fanuc 90/70 etc. 
  then again , that was last century . 
  tried stanwell ? 
  since ~ 1.6 or so , i started seeing clusters of red chevrons when one of my squad mates went lone-wolfing , so it has been working for a few patches . 
  i guess the problem is that passive vision helps the entire squad , which has more side effects than originally intended . 
  and the paperwork , ugh !, 
  yes , it becomes coriander seeds . 
  not in most of the english speaking world , no . 
  we 'll call him ed , short for ` ejectile dysfunction ', 
  so sending him a letter or calling his office would make more of an impact . 
  i bet they name their swords, 
  generally , yes . 
  bonus points if you spend the 20k on mining industry shares . 
  also [ one guy ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/iraqi-farouk-al-kasim-behind-norway-oil-fund-that-is-envy-of-world-1.2604105 ) in the ~ ~ 1950s ~ ~ 1960s who recognised norway 's oil fields before anyone else and told the government to put everything in place first . 
  he was an iraqi immigrant , too , so props to norway for listening to a brown person so long ago . 
  mining companies just front loaded the cap ex , so removing the mining tax would actually be a net loss right now . 
  fixed . 
  plasma cannon iii i think . 
  1.3 b will cover the freighter ; you 'd need another 5b for the jump freighter components . 
  perhaps start with the charon . 
  it 's still a pretty big project . 
  their ribs are good as well . 
  got the ribs + 2 sliders plate , top notch . 
  that will settle down once other states come on board , so immigration will slow . 
  what about if squad scan sharing were capped at 10m radius ? 
  what about if only medium suits and larger give squad passive scans , with the justification that light frames run stealth mode , and thus ca n't send scan data without being picked up ? 
  yeah . 
  as you go p0 -  p1 -  p2 -  p3 , the output is smaller than the volume of input , so it makes a lot of sense to just dump the p0 in your silo ( if you have one ) or spaceport , then let the factories pull from there and dump into your spaceport . 
  each 6000 units of p0 per hour you extract requires a basic factory to process . 
  when you first submit an extraction run , you may be extracting more p0 than the average , but that will soon settle down and your factories will cope ( that 's why you route the extractors into storage - to handle the initial overflow , and to supplement the factories towards the end of the cycle ), 
  it 's implicit . 
  i 'll put the word out in corp chat and one of our dedicated forum warriors can take the reins . 
  no he got voted out of the ceo role in a board of directors meeting . 
  or maybe to put blueberries in squads automatically, 
  sweating assets ? 
  a carrier is simply a battleship scaled up , using capital parts as an intermediate stage . 
  however , it does n't require tech 2 materials or anything exotic . 
  if you 're extracting , i guess it 's all profit , but be careful with import/export fees if you 're processing using transplanetary supply lines . 
  ... one way or another . 
  according to [ logibro ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2234919#post2234919 ) , it 's to do with vivox ( eve voice ) . 
  the survey screen should tell you how much you will extract per hour , on average . 
  you can work out the amount used by a factory by looking at its stats . 
  he should see a doctor about that .

  pity darwin 's lemmings imploded , they were running anywhere up to 450b isk killed per month . 
   why do n't we just nerf the jump bridges, 
  whatever he meant , small guys usually are n't more than one cyno away from their home base .

  about tree fiddy . 
  they 're already on [ copious amounts ] ( https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/inferno_\\ ( chronicle \\ ) ) of inferno , what more do you want from them ? 
  power companies can charge you more to be connected to the grid . 
  [ failheap ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/forumdisplay.php?12-war-amp-politics ), 
  it did n't die . 
  well i do n't know what to think , now . 
  i noticed that the screen shot was carefully selected to give the illusion that it is n't a complete mess on the other side . 
  i like the idea of corporations as just a default type of group , and that someone could belong to multiple groups at once , and the group itself could have a leader , roles , hangars , mailing lists , calendars , chat channels , api keys etc. 
  that really sounds like a nice goal ; a flexible system that can accommodate multiple scenarios . 
  further to that , api support is key to the whole ` eve is real ' experience . 
  exposing group calendars , group chat ( would be great to have a way to have chat channels be exposed to my mobile , for instance ) and so on is an obvious next step . 
  ** edit : ** also , make it extensible so dust , legion and valkyrie players can get in on the action . 
  fleet finder settings for the groups you belong to . 
  hnng . 
  they were n't this bad though . 
  `` we picked them up '', 
  `` then what ? '', 
  '' then we let them go . '', 
  '' let them go ? 
  where ? '', 
  '' oh , immediately .
