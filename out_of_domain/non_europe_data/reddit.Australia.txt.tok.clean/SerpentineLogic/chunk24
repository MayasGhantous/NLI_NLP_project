  lots of new zealanders and japanese on at that time . 
  not sure , but that 's the way i 'd bet . 
  is there something in the advanced camera controls esc-menu setting that will help ? 
  ship signature radius :, 
  hurricane 240 m, 
  occator : 165 m, 
  so , possibly relevant for t2 transports , but for t1 industrial ships , most things will hit you already, 
   this free shipping offer will only exist for a limited time , to be nullified at the overlords ' whim , so get in while the getting is good . 
  seems fair . 
  better than a hard cut-off . 
  between this and book depository , i 'm set .

  a list of beginner [ combat-related guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) i made a few days ago . 
  bit late to pull out now . 
  ** tldr ; ** good enough is the enemy of perfect .

  ( thank heavens for cut & paste ), 
  also , do n't mine in nullsec unless you * dominate * an entire pocket . 
  well , he has never denied it , so ... 
  this is good advice . 
  it 's better income , and will teach you valuable lessons in fleet combat . 
  [ part 2 ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/guide-introduction-to-incursions-part-2.html ) has some example fits . 
  is that the gene that also makes you more vulnerable to bubonic plague ? 
   that article makes chicago seem like a banana republic . 
  if it walks like a duck ... 
  that 's when you go from reacting to the market , to being a market player . 
  what , did you think that the zydrine bubble just happened without anyone helping it along ? 
   `` i have kids who are older than you and i play this game to get away from them '', 
  ouch . 
  then again , i 'd switch alliances to get away from alphastarpilot , so he has a point . 
  fairly certain that cva are nazis about moon mining poses in providence . 
  better to drop a pos somewhere in npc nullsec . 
  sure , you might end up with a platinum moon instead of something more lucrative , but at least you have a hope of keeping it . 
  starting out , you 'll need skills all over the place , from support skills to gunnery to drones to spaceship command . 
  you will also want to maximise the benefit from your attribute remapping without crippling yourself as you switch between skill trees . 
  i suggest remapping to maximum intelligence , with the rest into perception . 
  this allows you to concentrate on support skills while still training the required gunnery and spaceship skills . 
  after about 6 months or so , you will probably remap to max perception/rest willpower and focus on piloting and gunnery skills . 
  with regards to which skills you 'll need : the core certs are pretty decent , although imo core targeting is a bit out of kilter ( you wo n't need multitasking trained until you get into a logistics ship ) . 
  with regards to specific ships and skills , i suggest looking at a few common shield-tanked minmatar fits and ensuring you can use all the relevant modules . 
  accept that t2 guns will take a while to train for ; you 'll probably be able to spend almost two months just training skills that complete within 24 hours ( i like to queue a long skill , like drones v , then login once a day to add a < 24 hour skill to the front of the queue ) . 
  do n't be afraid to leave a skill at iii or iv when you 're starting out , in preference to getting another core skill up instead , but try to work out which skills you absolutely ** must ** get to v ( this will usually be decided by the modules you want to fit on your ship ), 
  probably because it would cap out within 30 seconds . 
  just out of curiosity , what 's his in-game name ? 
  anchoring v is useful for deploying large bubbles tho .

  most guides have an attached blog . 
  * the [ eve blog pack ] ( http://eveoganda.blogspot.com.au/p/eve-blog-pack.html ) has a good mix of eve news , pvp diaries and commentary via rss feed, 
  * [ kil2 ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?5056-kil2-s-youtube-stuffs ) has some neat pvp videos, 
  * genos occidere [ has a new site ] ( http://www.evenews24.com/2012/03/11/garmonation-9-and-a-new-instructional-pvp-website/ ) , which is apparently cool . 
  not really . 
  they may have more money but they know that they will live longer too , so they 'll spend at the same rate . 
  rightly so , as it turned out . 
  another person who has n't heard of courier contracts . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/how_6620f2_1588811.jpg ) ( and true ), 
  a lot of loyalty points ? 
  ... then you use iviewnapper to hang onto it . 
  or so i 've heard . 
  it 's a tax on mining , but only new mines , and only if they make too much profit ( i.e. 
  it does n't kick in if you 're only making 6 % profit on your big-ass mining operation ), 
  according to the mining companies , it 's too high . 
  according to the restrictions being put on mining companies everywhere else in the world , it 's pretty damn lenient . 
  and a lot of people are concerned that the money from the mining tax will just be frittered away each year instead of being stored in a long-term fund , like norway and saudi arabia are doing with their oil revenues . 
  i 've flown a passive shield tanked myrm , and six shield power relays will make a dent in any sized capacitor . 
  so , i use one of my precious mid slots , gimping my tank to fit a cap injector just to use unbonused lasers with no damage mods ? 
  do you * seriously * think that 's a good idea ? 
  being a queenslander , i am already ok with putting ` eh ' at the end of every sentence . 
  you could probably grab it from the eve-central data dumps as well . 
   if you 're resume, 
  your . 
  to be fair , nobody else is going to do it for them . 
  you already have a tengu . 
  fit it [ for exploration ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) and practice scanning in high-sec first . 
  i do n't know if you realise this , but the high-sec guristas complexes can drop deadspace small shield boosters and i-fields . 
  a couple of those per month will pay for a plex . 
  there 's a fair bit of competition in caldari space , but that just adds to the excitement . 
  if it gets too contested , change region ( or change empire ), 
  once you have paid back the cost of the tengu a few times , venturing into lowsec in a cloaky exploration fit should n't be an issue . 
  you 're more experienced in the ship , and it 's already paid for out of exploration profits , so why not ? 
  within 6 months , you 'll probably be in venal :p, 
  considered applying in a mining town , perhaps interstate ? 
  [ national minimum wage ] ( http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx ) details . 
  note that you 're above minimum wage so all bets are off . 
  making fashion ... 
  like a boss . 
  your options are :, 
  get your character back from your mate, 
  get one of your mate 's characters off him if he likes your char so much . 
  get your mate to give you isk . 
  chip in with some isk from selling plex and buy a character from the character bazaar . 
  start training a character right now and just do n't login for a few weeks until it 's not terrible, 
  start training a character right now , get your mate to buy you a hundred shitfit rifters , then join red vs blue and and take part in the carnage . 
  i hear it 's [ popular ] ( http://twitter.com/#!/themittani/status/172778467404947456 ) ... 
  you can make a tengu as hard to scan down as the signature itself , by judicious use of eccm . 
  frankly , though , as soon as you see probes on scan , it 's probably time to leave . 
  people camp gates because that way you have a chance to catch everyone who enters the system via that gate . 
  scanning only works when the target is in space . 
  if they 're just warping from gate to gate , you wo n't be able to scan them down in time ( and if you did , they 'd just jump through the gate ), 
  yes , an exploration fit t3 will be in a fair bit of trouble . 
  you 'll be able to fight off a wild vexor that appears , or maybe some of the recon ships , but you 'll likely due to any combat fit packing neuts .
