  i usually start out with blue steel , but depending on the situation i 'll break out with ferrari , le tigre or magnum . 
  well , corp roles is a seething cesspool of shit , so presumably that would be improved . 
  there 's a lot of things that might be possible ( e.g. 
  alliance taxes ) but just ca n't be implemented because of all the inflexible code in the corp and alliance code base . 
  that makes a huge difference . 
  i mean , with rounding , that changes from twice the population of australia all the way down to only 1x . 
   they 've had a century of humiliation they 're busy putting behind them . 
  well , they 're certainly getting up to speed with dishing it out . 
  ... that his policy decisions caused . 
  it 's not as if hitler lined up jews and executed them either . 
  all six million of them ? 
  personally ? 
  okay . 
  i bet his trigger finger was sore . 
  so lining people up and killing them is not okay , but just putting people you do n't like at the [ bottom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_mass_killings#cite_ref-valentino_a_112-1 ) of the priority order during a famine you created yourself is not so bad ? 
  so , what 's the party at the top of the world like ? 
  it has been described as a multi-player treachery simulator , with spaceships . 
  how about hazar ? 
  i 'm quite fond of icelandic electronic dance music for some obscurer reason . 
  all these moments , lost in time , like tears in rain [ .

  gal has fewer high slots to hunt with ( and cal has fewer low slots to damp with ), 
   do you worry about knowledge being passed in the mainstream to avoid safaris , scams , ganks and more ? 
  jita local suggests there 's nothing to worry about . 
  feel free to discuss it in the forum thread . 
  a lot of people seem okay with the change . 
  `` in the shade '' is the motto of the [ greek 20th armoured division ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_armored_division_\\ ( greece \\ ) ) , which appears to have a lot of artillery in it . 
  then it 's pasteurised milk , which is okay . 
  snake soup is a chinese dish , only the rat would be surprising . 
  it 's also the bit that does n't require ridiculous amounts of programming . 
  eve players already use the market , blueprints etc. 
  legion players will have to use a market to buy and sell stuff anyway . 
  all you need is to link them up . 
  do you have a go pro or similar mounted camera ? 
  it 's the popular name-brand mobile cam . 
  they 're a couple hundred bucks , but when [ shit like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i60m2i8rzq&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) happens , it 's good to have that recording . 
  turn off gate keeper , it cuts off untrusted downloads after a few gig . 
  i do n't know about you guys , but i 'm taking statements by eterne as canon . 
  so , like grain-fed beef , except rodent ? 
  fair enough . 
  that 's something a bit different . 
  type the following in terminal :, 
  sudo spctl -- master-disable, 
  if the second command returns :, 
  assessments disabled, 
  you should be able to install ( after restarting your computer to be sure ), 
  a little more detail would be nice . 
  / r/fittings, 
  some things to note :, 
  1 . do n't fit big guns on a myrm , it 's not even bonused for guns . 
  fit 200mm rails , and resist the urge to make them tech 2 unless you can spare the fitting room ( you ca n't ) . 
  your tanking modules should be active armour hardeners unless you know your capacitor will be sucked dry during the mission . 
  even then , i 'd be tempted to run cap boosters instead of putting up with sub-par resists . 
  you 're probably over-capped . 
  any time you 're fitting three cap rechargers , you 're probably better off fitting a cap booster instead . 
  booster chargers are ridiculously cheap and you may even pick more up during the mission . 
  ( they do use a lot of cargo though , so i totally understand if you want to use the space for tractor units instead ), 
  choice of drone actually does make a big difference . 
  for instance , gardes are for short range ( 30km optimal/18km falloff ) but wardens are 75km/34km so there 's case to be made for fitting for long-range plinking instead :, 
  like so :,

  anyway , i 'm bad at fits but that 's an alternative . 
  warp at 75km or mjd away with hobgoblins clearing stuff out , drop wardens , pop everything . 
  that committee sounds like it has its head screwed on the right way . 
  i 'm okay with this . 
  because woo scary . 
   the cash income is a huge deal which heavily boosts their income but often goes fully or partly unreported . 
  if the regular minimum applied to them , they 'd possibly earn less money , but they 'd * definitely * do less tax evasion ( to the tune of ~ $ 8 per hour ) , because let 's face it , that 's what it is . 
  if you have pi alts , probably the first thing you should consider is training one of them up to manufacture nanite repair paste . 
  it 's the best way ever to reduce the volume of certain pi products . 
  i 'm of the opinion that sec status should never go up or down in null sec . 
  if concord does n't care about your evil deeds in null , it should also not care about your good deeds . 
  i meant null . 
  read it again . 
  settle , petal . 
  if you do n't have the me skill trained and you try to do industry pre-crius , everyone knows that you 're doing it wrong . 
  it 's basically train to v or gtfo . 
  it 's a huge barrier to entry for noobs , just like the learning skills used to be . 
  changing it so it 's an optional skill that will boost your isk-per-hour by 5 % while not kicking noobs in the nuts is a * good * thing . 
  also , waste is no longer a thing after crius , so it was never going to do the same thing as it used to .
