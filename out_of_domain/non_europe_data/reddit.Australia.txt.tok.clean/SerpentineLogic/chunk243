  it 's a 5 % reduction in slot fees , regardless of how productive that slot is over the course of the week . 
  yes . 
  evidence : this thread . 
  * must * it translate to a major profit ? 
  check your privilege . 
  if you check my post , i believe i said 5 % more isk per hour , not 5 % profit boost . 
  there 's quite a difference between the two . 
  they have patents instead . 
  note that patents need full disclosure during the application process . 
  this thread . 
  bravo . 
  only tech 2 ships have that restriction . 
  what 's this about fw system upgrades and production costs ? 
  so , like job cost , or material cost ? 
  ok cool that 's fine then . 
  scout ck0 , 4 shield extenders . 
  you 're never going to find damped scouts so do n't bother . 
  my oncologist has advised me to stay away from this thread . 
  *** do *** try to keep up , 007 . 
  i do n't think torfi likes to share, 
  it happened before . 
  labor created medicare . 
  libs killed it . 
  labor put it back again . 
  each country ** has to ** have their own system , just so they can control it . 
  how those credits are traded between other countries is handled just like any other trade agreement . 
  sure , it 's * easier * if one eu credit = 1 au credit , but it 's also not realistically going to happen . 
  maybe message / u/dianalynnetc and see whether she has plans to support google wallet . 
  also , buying minerals from buy orders really helps . 
  um , what else . 
  oh yeah , if you plan to build stuff before crius hits , prioritise the battleships with the most extra materials , since after the patch hits , those extra materials will be rolled into the normal materials , and thus will be subject to the new system . 
  yeah , looks like max is 5 slots . 
  perhaps they 'll remove a high slot from amarr and give the sidearm back . 
  one interesting argument i have heard is that amarr and caldari logistics have bonuses to deployed equipment that is drop and forget ( in comparison to the always-in-your-hand bonuses of gallente and minmatar ) . 
  so , they will have to stay alive for their bonuses to work , and they will be using their weapons more often , so it makes sense that they get sidearms as well . 
  rich people with waterfront property . 
  well , once you 're past character creation that is . 
  tldr if you used a decryptor to make your blueprint copy , i strongly suggest you build it this weekend . 
  different type of escorts . 
  qf and va stopped flying over ukraine , at least a month ago , probably closer to three months . 
  according to my sources , machariels have dropped from an average of 745m to 695m over the past month in a slow by steady decline that does n't show immediate evidence of manipulation . 
  volume traded per day seems to be in the high 50 's . 
  given that manufacturing costs in crius are going to increase the price of some things by a few percent , i 'd say that , all things considered , you may as well buy now . 
  it 's very much a case of \\ #sorry \\ #notsorry from putin . 
  why not just put them on the market in fw land . 
  maybe trawl through kill stats in fw space and pick out some good corps to contact , then . 
  bring some nanite paste to sell , too . 
  noobs do n't use nanite paste , so it 's better intel . 
  after crius , invention will produce material level 0 copies . 
  or you can invent them now , and the - 4 copies will become +2 level during the patch . 
  learn to take statements issued by russian media to their domestic audience with a grain of salt . 
  international exchanges may be rife with fake credits , and of course the money goes overseas . 
  better to keep it domestic until we make the easy changes then set up exchange agreements on terms we can control . 
  oh i do n't know . 
  it 's likely he 's been briefed by asio about it . 
  one would think he would be more circumspect when accusing a member of the un security council , but that 's tone for you . 
  -4 is 50 % waste currently . 
  during the changeover , tech 2 blueprints will rise in materials by 50 % so it 's a wash at me 0 . 
  so , getting it translated to me 2 which in turn is translated to 7 in crius means seven percent less materials used . 
  that 's good . 
  of course , if you used a decryptor to get down to me-1 ( a massive improvement in cost ) , you 'll just go to me10 so it probably was n't worth it any more . 
  iirc most of the 23 australians were scientists , and there were about the same number of americans ( 27 ) on that flight , so it 's a decent guess that there 'd be another two equal-sized bunches of delegates from the netherlands and another euro country to make a round 1000 . 
  yes , you 're still capped on concurrent jobs by skills . 
  my mistake ; early reports said there were a couple dozen americans on board . 
  do all activityids have an associated costindex ? 
  because lines 354-376 could be refactored to assign them to variables before the massive unwieldy if ( ) statement . 
  similarly , lines 212-240 could be refactored via a function that would extract a lot of the verbosity . 
  i did this . 
  got put on a watch list as a probable spy . 
  oh well , i made director a few years later . 
  \\ #playingthelonggame, 
  renters in angel space happened . 
  the perth mint also sells gold coins by weight ( 1/10 oz , 1/2 oz etc ) if you prefer . 
   they do this because their way of eliminating competition is burning this motherfucker to the ground . 
  the reason australia has so much iron ore reserves is because the flora and fauna are * fucking metal * \\ m /, 
  nuts , they caught us out . 
  and not for , say , assassination via radioactive pellets . 
  on second thought ... 
  that 's not a valid analogy , unless you rent your curtains by the month . 
  it 's more like paying the fees for two all-you-can-eat restaurants in the one evening . 
  generally , the backstabbing is done outside of high-sec , or if someone sees an opportunity to pop a flimsy ship carrying expensive cargo and is willing to wear the cost of losing their own ship . 
  players are , in general , quite encouraging of new players and are willing to help out where they can . 
  being in a corporation is extra helpful , since players will always be more inclined to help a corp-mate than a random person they encounter in local chat . 
  sometimes the choice is not between an indian doctor and an american doctor , but between affording * any * doctor vs not affording one . 
  good analysis , but the last sentence seemed to come out of nowhere . 
  people find each of the careers rewarding , but the military option is probably best for a first character . 
  why poor ? 
  the last all you can eat place i went to charged $ 53 a head . 
  what 's wrong with making them a bit flashier for achievement-hunters ? 
  get rank 10 in fw or some stupidly high npc corp standings and get a public medal and a limited edition ship skin ? 
  sure , why not . 
  it does n't take a lot of time and for some people this is compelling game content . 
  yeah , it is for me . 
  bone [ morrow ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_morrow ) ? 
  sounds like the name of a fake tv show created by the chaser team . 
  settle , petal . 
  well , they could if they were deserters from the ukrainian army . 
  at any rate , the equipment is probably the same as the russians use anyway . 
  i 'd give it a 95 % chance . 
  after all , both he and shorten would have been briefed by asi ~ ~ o ~ ~ s about the situation .
