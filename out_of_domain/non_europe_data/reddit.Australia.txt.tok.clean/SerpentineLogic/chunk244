  as an aside , for those who want to know how the russian media is covering this :, 
   according to a levada center poll in june , 94 percent of russians say they get their information about russia and the world from television ( as opposed to 9 percent who said they get information from the internet ) . 
  more than 50 percent said they receive such information from only one source . 
  about 60 percent said they think state television relates information about events in ukraine objectively .

   the genus name is derived from bagheera , the black panther from rudyard kipling 's jungle book , with the species name honoring kipling himself . 
  tldr ; no .

  it was basically that the guy was a doctor so he was still working one or two days a week or he 'd lose his license . 
  so a 1-run battlecruiser bpc is like 10k ? 
  seems low , even if it is an increase on current prices . 
  heck , the base install cost for an invention job is 10k . 
  it 's interesting that there 's no time component to the cost . 
  i guess it leans heavily on the item 's rank for that . 
  ~ ~ wow , invention costs for ships have skyrocketed . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ 20m stealth bomber -  400k invention fee . ~ ~, 
  what about something like a 10-run job ? 
  is it 10x the invention fee ? 
  what about stuff that produces more than one item , like t2 ammo ? 
  is the cost based on 1 round of ammo , or the 5000 it produces ? 
  well , there was [ * this * video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u5muhit4ie ) ... 
  you should contact [ roc weiler ] ( http://rocwieler.com ) . 
  ever tried house of serenity ? 
  monarch as mascot . 
  he bagged a hot australian wife , so it 's working out for him . 
  yeah , rorqual is now the cap of choice to take already-compressed stuff from low sec to null for processing . 
  do n't forget evedroid , if you have an android phone or tablet . 
  https://twitter.com/andersostlund/statuses/490804808686006272 for the slightly longer summary . 
  incidentally , that would be a great brand name for medical cannabis used to treat childhood epilepsy/seizures . 
  skiffs and procurers can . 
  heck , they get bonuses to drone damage . 
  it turns out poland ** can ** into space . 
  with an exploration-fit proteus dealing , say , 500dps , you 'll need three minutes to grind through the ehp of a skiff ... 
  i 'm frantically , frantically trying to get through my stash of t2 bpcs that use decryptors . 
  i 'm not * 100 % * sure how the math works in crius , but right now , the difference between a me-4 and me-1 bpc is about 30 % of material cost . 
  granted , that me-1 will turn into something like ml9 post-crius , but when you factor in the +50 % materials needed for t2 stuff , the 9 % less from ml9 does n't stack up against the 20 % savings pre-crius . 
  if i build a marauder for 900m now , and post-crius the cost moves to 1b and the sell price moves to 1.1 b , then instead of making 10 % profit when i sell it , i 'll make 20 % on that stock . 
  that seems like a good enough reason to build now . 
  well , then , are you branching out into carrying compressed ore instead of 425mm rail guns ? 
  for that , a rorqual works quite well ... 
  well , good thing you 're not over-reacting to stuff . 
  christ !, 
  what 's worse : at the end of the trip , you 're in dubbo . 
  or maybe this was literally the first time in forever that someone had actually done a good deed for you . 
  rocks . 
  of course , that means bodies either get stuck in the rocks or get washed up elsewhere , which also sucks for those who have to retrieve them . 
  if talking to the administration does n't work , talk to the parents of kids with allergies . 
  i guarantee * they * wo n't accept the status quo . 
  it 's not bad per se , although i 'd class it as incomplete . 
  malcanis said it best when he said ( paraphrased - he had a lot more swearing ), 
   `` nobody likes being forced to think . 
  even people who like to think hate being forced to think . 
  this patch makes people think , so there will always be push-back , even if it [ makes life easier ] ( http://eveblog.allumis.co.uk/?p=1947 ) . '', 
  i can definitely see some players being team groupies and setting up shop where someone else has bought a team and freeloading . 
  yeah , i know , blogspam , but this is time-sensitive data , and frankly there just have n't been enough screenshots of crius stuff yet , so this is all i 've got . 
  normal array : deploy anywhere . 
  intensive array : deploy anywhere except high sec . 
  station : null sec only , can be upgraded to be awesome , does n't cost fuel . 
  yeah , you could say that . 
  then it will be interesting seeing how the bidding escalates when the first capital component teams become available . 
  but hey , if it works to create some sort of cooperation between industrial players or corps , then that 's good , right ? 
  them janitors got ta get paid , yo . 
  say you 're a middling industrialist , just the one character . 
  you see a team with an auction ending in 2 days time , and the front-runner is a system in khanid . 
  you work out what you want to make that will suit that team , then nolife your way through invention until you have say , 70 bpcs . 
  each bpc takes maybe 6 million isk worth of materials , so you 've already put in the manufacturing jobs to produce some of the t2 components ( you 'll buy the rest if you run out ) . 
  then , when the auction ends , you rock up in your orca , unload the bpcs and start manufacturing . 
  a week later , you 've sold off most of the modules you manufactured , but now the market has tanked , and will continue to be bad for the next six weeks because the big boys are still churning them out in this solar system at discount prices , and will do until the entire month is up . 
  never mind , you have a profit , and this lets you start building t2 components for that tasty assault frigate team whose auction is ending in four day 's time ... 
  it 's not to increase ice income ; it 's to help prevent the collapse in the ice market , because a lot of towers will be downsized or pulled down in crius . 
  if you have a blueprint copy , 2 days max ( give or take skills , installation , implants etc ), 
  if you have a bpo , then by all means build any amount up to 30 days at a time . 
  and just like the golden gate , occasionally someone will throw someone else off it and make like it was a suicide . 
  what do you mean , ' *** these *** people ' ? 
  what a big ** and ** you have , grand mama . 
  yeah but people do n't like incomplete . 
  generally the idea is to leave the income generating stuff alone . 
  like the carbon tax and green investment fund . 
  but no , they had to be ideological about it ...

  the first bill said `` this is a list of violent criminal organisations , and these bikie clubs are on it '' . 
  the second bill said `` this is the definition of a violent criminal organisation :, 
  1 . you 're on the list ( see bill # 1 ), 
  2 . a bunch of other badly-written garbage that means you could include the canterbury bulldogs club or the ses, 
  and the rest of it is all the ridiculously unjustifiable things they can do to you if you are flagged as a member . 
  and terrifyingly plausible .
