  there ai n't no such thing as a free lunch .

  yes , although you get at least a 10 % discount . 
  invention changes will affect availability/supply , and thus margins , sure . 
  but muffins was talking about cost , not margins . 
  i think you should try eveiskperhour . 
  for instance , in ten seconds it told me that the top ammunition to build , based on me10 , pe10 blueprints , with a market movement of more than ten svr ( to remove low-demand items ) , are :, 
  * phased plasma l, 
  * iridium charge m, 
  * mjolnir cruise missile, 
  * nova cruise missile, 
  * emp l, 
  * scourge heavy assault missile, 
  and it even notes the expected isk/hour profit per manufacturing line . 
  reaching . 
  op success so far .

  what kind of testing happens ? 
  do you guys do unit testing ? 
  how do you automate the ui testing ? 
  from what i 've seen , testers are meant to find everything , and it 's up to the business rep to decide whether to fix or mark it as ` wo n't fix ' . 
  after that , testers should not raise errors that already have tickets . 
  \\* holds up ten fingers \\*, 
  two . 
  not more than two . 
  the trick is to work out when not to trust the program . 
  that may be true , but one is certainly better than the other right now . 
  i disagree . 
  if there was a demand for 100b trit per month , and 5b of that gets turned into 425mm rail guns , shipped to null sec and turned into supers , then after crius , there 'd be a demand for 95b trit and 5b of compressed veldspar . 
  * compressed ore * will be where the price premium is applied . 
  minerals will continue at the same price , with less supply and less demand . 
  ironically , you do know people with lots of experience with full scale automation of eves ui . 
  bot makers . 
  this pleases me . 
  hopefully there will be some in-game news bulletins ?

  whatever your solution , having a compression array available will make things a lot easier . 
  but again , job costs are capped at 10 % , which is quite okay for some markets , compared to the massive pain in the ass it is to move them from elsewhere ( e.g. 
  t1 industrial ships ), 
  actually , no . 
  csm was still getting ndas signed weeks after the results were announced . 
  they just did n't get access to nda 'd chat channels until the paperwork was signed . 
  you 're correct , it 's not capped . 
  if jita is responsible for , say , 10 % of the manufacturing in the cluster , then the system index will be 0.31 ( which , incidentally , is pretty massive ), 
  i 'm not sure what that translates to when building a 50m isk battlecruiser , but it 's entirely possible that it 's worth it when building a 400k isk badger . 
  you can buy eve time cards with cash as well . 
  heck , you can even buy credit cards with cash . 
  i may have gone overboard buying bpos to research . 
  i 'm now the proud owner of a me10 minmatar station egg bpo . 
  i do n't have the foggiest what i 'll do with it . 
  well , do what you want . 
  just bear in mind that steam + eve is a pain in the butt . 
  do n't say you were n't warned . 
  however , the flip side is that , because the entire electorate goes to the polls , there 's no need for each political party to encourage people to actually vote . 
  it turns out that it 's a lot , lot easier to get your own supporters to vote than it is to get nonaligned voters to vote , so you end up whipping your base into a frenzy and catering to the extremists instead of appealing to the swing voters . 
  that 's a bad thing . 
  say what you will about mandatory voting , but it strongly encourages political parties to capture the mainstream instead of the extremist factions , and that 's a good thing . 
  we have this in australia as well . 
  you 're legally required ^ * to go into the voting booth with a ballot , and then to put it in the box afterwards . 
  you 're *** not *** legally required to fill it out . 
  ^ ( * if you do n't , then you theoretically get fined sixty bucks or so . ), 
  what 's better is that the country ran fine without a government . 
  but who could you trust : /, 
  sure , although you may want to finish the tutorials first , 
  then join [ these guys ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/bovril+boreers+mining+co-op ) , they 're bloodthirsty null sec miners and industry guys . 
  the us constitution is pretty good , and arguably the best of its time , but it 's not the best at everything any more . 
  what ? 
  not really . 
  you set up an office in a research station , then members can copy from hangar 7 ( readonly ) to hangar 1 . 
  when they 're ready to deliver , they deliver them , then move them from hangar 1 ( the only hangar they can take from ) to their tower or just build them as a personal project . 
  alternatively , if blueprints are locked down you can ease up on the restrictions somewhat . 
  it 's not ideal . 
  talk to a csm of your choice about it , and see what eventuates . 
  spreadsheets are easy if you know xpath . 
  * favourite : / u/new _ eden_news_bot , easily the best poster in this sub . 
  * worst : any time kugu people turn up and attempt to impress everybody with how random they are . 
  oh , and that guy who suspiciously sends recall invites 5 seconds after anyone posts about recall invites . 
  * what makes a good mod ? 
  vindictiveness . 
  * i subscribe to the philosophy of being reactive unless it 's clearly beyond the rules of reddit . 
  i 'm not a social justice warrior ii . 
  * if it 's questionable , i 'll leave it and message the real mods . 
  of course , if it 's at -27 votes i might just hide it . 
  -26 is fine , but -27 is * totally unacceptable * . 
  * i 'm in autz , which is just before rus tz , or like eight hours after west coast us . 
  * i do nothing in moderation . 
  * i can into css enough to apply flair and mess with wordpress . 
  * i would like everyone to know that i have 8.0 standings with / r/eve and look forward to one day getting a 1-run bpc . 
  it 's probably worth noting that boring ` we met in an mmo ' relationships make for boring tv , even if you 're * trying * to make the point that mmo relationships are just as valid and common as sporting-team relationships or book-club relationships . 
  having said that , this does give me a bonus room kind of vibe . 
  except what you pay for something has no bearing on what something is worth . 
  what something is worth , is what someone is willing to pay for it . 
  in the case of virtual items , you 're forbidden from paying out-of-game money for them , so their worth is zero .
