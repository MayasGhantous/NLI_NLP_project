  do you think such treatments may have applicability to mckenzie in the future ? 
  so , set your own price ? 
  obviously it has to go for a premium above normal ore , because of the effort and infrastructure required to compress it . 
  in fact , i suggest that compressed ore should sell for more than the price of the minerals that can be extracted from it in high sec , because it can be reprocessed in null sec to make up the difference in price with higher extraction rate .

  you suddenly find yourself attempting to refute that the world / the country / a continent has been cooling since 1997 / 2006 / 2009 or whatever year it is convenient to start their argument from . 
  i have discovered it 's possible to construct a complete narrative of the past 200years as the beginning of a whole series of cooling trends off an ever higher series of baselines .

  fair enough . 
  to an extent that 's true ( houses in remote mining towns can cost $ 90,000 per year just to rent ) , but for the most part it 's due to tax breaks . 
  interest payments on investment properties is tax-deductible ( so you save 30-47 % on that outlay ), 
  capital gains tax is halved for properties held for more than 12 months, 
  combined , this means that investors can borrow a lot more for the same interest payments compared to first-hime buyers , which raises prices in general . 
  in addition , when those price rises hit , investors can then sell , take profits at a discounted rate , then do it all again . 
  since the economy is faring okay and consumer confidence is reasonably optimistic , this leads to spiralling housing prices .
