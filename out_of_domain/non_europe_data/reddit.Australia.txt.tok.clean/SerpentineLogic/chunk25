  nullsec is a lot safer because it 's considerably less-densely populated . 
  if it 's sovereign nullsec and you 're blue to them , it 's arguably safer than highsec . 
  i suspect that if julian assange gets into the senate , he would also ask for this kind of stuff . 
  * switch from scourge fury to cn scourge if there 's combat probes on scan, 
  * remember whether the site had an acceleration gate or not, 
  * if there * is * an acceleration gate , drop a unit of ammo in a can where it drops you , and make sure you 're at least 35km away from it whenever there 's someone else in local . 
  i guess the workers will be run off their feet and flat out all week . 
  did n't get to have kids :(, 
  [ venal ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/venal ) is the home region of the guristas pirates . 
  as npc-faction controlled nullsec , all stations are free to dock in . 
  as the home region of a pirate faction , the ratting is very good , and the anomalies and signatures are many and large . 
  it 's ( [ barely ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/thanatos,555/nalvula:h-pa29 ) ) one cyno jump from highsec , which makes it fairly easy to support an extended stay , once you get someone down there to light a cyno . 
  * capital mining barges . 
  * industry and science vessels ( not haulers ), 
  * ewar battleships, 
  not gon na happen . 
  microsoft restricts xbox developers too much . 
  you 're more likely to see dust on pc than on xbox . 
  dust mouse + keyboard support is confirmed on ps3 btw . 
  as an australian , i do n't see what 's wrong about that globe . 
  i 'm not certain why you would think a tengu would get into neut range of your ship . 
  capital mining barges would not be able to enter highsec . 
  they would n't compete with noobs in ospreys . 
  computer died with 4 hours skill training left . 
  wife would not let me use hers , because she hates `` that stupid game '' . 
  went to store , bought laptop . 
   they lost an orbiter because of the imperial system . 
  fyp . 
  i was initially skeptical , but mirriam-webster [ confirms it ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trait ) :, 
   ** trait **, 
   noun \\ \u02c8tr\u0101t , british usually \u02c8tr\u0101 \\, 
  fyi australians pronounce it like the americans do , probably because we have no french influence . 
  no way !, 
  then i 'd have to return double the amount . 
  my car is an obelisk . 
  as a parent , let me advise you that a pos network is orders of magnitude less of a time sink than a child . 
  i bet they did nazi that coming . 
  when a topic is titled, 
   title : ** who at fanfest got to play dust 514 ? 
  and you reply, 
   i was n't there and have n't played it . 
  do n't expect upvotes for contributing to the conversation . 
  just saiyan . 
  no big surprise, 
  perhaps too many people going down ? 
  i saw it on a current affair , so it must be true . 
  i lost a tengu with better stats than that last night , and it only cost 800m isk . 
  i 'm sure you would know all about that . 
  i think in real terms , australia is the highest of the developed nations . 
  52 % of its average wage still works out to about usd $ 15/hour . 
  the big surprise is britain , with the minimum wage being 66 % of average wage . 
  that implies that either the minimum wage is a touch too high , or they need to create a lot more high-paying jobs to even their income tax base out . 
  the technetium market disproves your theory . 
  it 's quite balanced in team fortress . 
  if you 're side-tracking for logistics , why not go for a damnation instead ? 
  the training plan is fairly simple :, 
  get cybernetics iv , plug in +4 implants, 
  remap for leadership skills for perfect t2 armored warfare links, 
  remap to per/will for ship skills ( do drone skills now ), 
  remap to int/mem for support/navigation skills, 
  it 's not 690dps unless you have a lot of implants , which i do n't , because : nullsec :, 
  [ eve-kill ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12847786 ), 
  i 'll probably downship for a while , since kids tend to interfere with paying attention to local spikes . 
  close . 
  at least he did n't go nuts dealing with the fame . 
  and, 
   over half ( 52 % ) of people not in the labour force were aged 60 years or over . 
  no big surprise . 
  should have sold him off . 
  yeah , it 's [ bacchanalian from rote ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/picture-of-week-twins.html ) . 
   needless to say , rote kapelle and veto membership had a lot of fun with this ... 
  so far , bacch has scammed a third-party transfer of a super-carrier ( and pocketed the money ) , promised docking rights in vfk to raiden , encouraged gents and two other alliances to invade intrepid crossing space because they 'll get goon help , told 137 pubbies that he 'd sponsor their entries into goonwaffe , and subtly threatened a ccp employee that he was going to get beaten up at the csm may summit . 
  of course ? 
  i mean really , who does n't like mustard ? 
  if you get the right rigs , you can two-shot cruisers and three-shot battlecruisers ( and ten-shot battleships ) , so eventually you learn how many salvos you need and switch targets without loss . 
  ohai are you doing the political updates again ? 
  that 's the only reason i 'd go to kugu for . 
  you are when it 's your alliance hot dropping someone else . 
  not so much when it 's your turn to be in the barrel . 
  triage module requires logistics . 
  might be prudent to pick it up . 
  someone recently downloaded everything and had the same issues . 
  in the end , they clicked, 
  and it basically fixed everything . 
  it 's a bit annoying to get the fourth battleship into deep structure when you run out of missiles , then have to watch it rep up while you reload . 
  swilling wounded tissue around your mouth is more sterile than washing it with something high in alchohol , or vinegar , or boiled water ? 
   what do i need to know/do to get through the hardest part of any mmo ( especially one such as eve that seems very complex ) , the beginning ? 
  a good corporation . 
  failing that , [ dreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/ ) . 
  til the mash song actually has lyrics . 
   factions . 
  i do n't even know who you guys `` work for '', 
  there are four major empires that control large swathes of the eve cluster . 
  two of them hate the other two . 
  most ships that capsuleers can fly are designed by the four empires , and thus require empire-specific piloting skills . 
  there are also pirate factions on the fringe of empire space that you can ally with . 
  but mostly , players band together in corporations and work towards their own goals . 
  is this money ? 
  how do you get it . 
  from what i 've read , you can mine , pirate , scam , and manage a business .
