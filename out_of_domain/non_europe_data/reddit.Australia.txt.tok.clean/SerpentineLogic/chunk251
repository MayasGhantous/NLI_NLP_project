  it 's so valuable for us . 
  i want to keep doing this , getting tough questions and how to turn eve into this amazing thing . 
  cz : ( btw seagull has been really great about open communication . 
  if you do n't feel comfortable about contacting her directly , talk to a csm member and we 'll pass it on ) thanks for being so awesome . 
  seagull : thanks for all the work you do on the csm . 
  i would like the ability to change market orders , submit jobs etc , because then i could let my bot play eve and i could go outside and ride bikes . 
  maybe to prevent abuse , you could only have a certain amount of things you could do each day , unless you paid aurum for ` no seriously this is important ' . 
  if it 's good enough for clash of clans , it 's good enough for ccp , 
  servers are up , your dns is just shot .

  not sure yet , depends on whining . 
  earliest it could drop is next tuesday . 
  test : not elite , but # 1 with elitists . 
  he has a point though . 
  combat losses are usually insured and pilots manage their implant risk appropriately . 
  non-combat losses to piracy are both more lucrative for the attacker and more costly to the loser ( ca n't insure cargo , and you may have lost collateral too ) so if you want to cause economic damage against a null sec alliance that you ca n't actually kick out of their sov space , that 's the way to do it . 
  cz20 never forget, 
  as long as it 's not a spoon , phew . 
  but seriously , it 's a good model for letting players do stuff , but not too much , unless it 's really important to them . 
  they have n't said , just that they will change . 
  steve is csm so he knows things . 
  well the csm all seem to have blogs ( some created them after they got elected ) but tumblr or twitter works as long as it 's restricted to you posting with your cpm hat on . 
  but yeah if logi bro is correct even a forum thread would work ? 
  works for me . 
  generally , yes . 
  in essence , the larger the item , the longer it takes .
