  maybe you need to be logged in or something . 
  could be . 
  no mtac or jets in dust . 
  maybe in legion . 
  at this stage , all we 've heard is that it will be free to play . 
  my bet is that there will be an optional subscription , like most games of that type . 
  the problem is [ holes in the pipe ] ( http://justalittlefurther.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vegemite_cracker-worms.jpg ) . 
  wrong kind of bump . 
  many hot drop moros fits use a couple of faction cap boosters ; they 're better in the short-term ( and in the long term , you 're dead anyway ), 
  you might be able to extract some typical fits from [ this ] ( http://www.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=12548657 ) . 
  i think a healthy attitude is to accept that you 'll be paying a dozen bucks a month , and any plex you earn will be used to extend the time between subscription cycles . 
  starting with a rolling 3-month sub is probably the most prudent choice . 
  so you want it to say ` aligning ' until you 're non-interactable , then switch to warping ? 
  well , the state gets more productivity out of citizens who are n't , e.g. 
  in jail . 
  then there 's less costs from the police force , but that 's a slow wind-down due to politics . 
  but then there 's more costs from the pot-safety-inspectors , so all in all it 'll take a while to work itself out . 
  sensor integrity warfare link is so good when it 's fleet-wide ( the other two are best used as a squad - or wing-specific boost since they 're not universally applicable ), 
  even standard strength is better than nothing . 
  in short , do n't be morose . 
  1 . who ? 
  why ask us ? 
  what do you hope to achieve by posting ?

  and there 's always vulturefleet , 
  you need purger rigs . 
  you 're not quite bitter enough to run for the csm , but you 're getting there . 
  trends are not fads . 
  you got quotes from nrma , what about racq ? 
  set up a kickstarter . 
  not exactly companies with stellar reputations , there . 
  maybe they hate you more than they like money . 
  i think i got this . 
  is the answer ` an eve character ' ? 
  besides reading the sidebar ? 
  actually that titan was free , courtesy of aaa and poor choice of third party . 
  if it 's cheap , yes . 
  if it 's expensive , you can always make copies and put them in instead . 
  well it 's not as if she picked up good parenting skills as a child . 
  someone else do the transcription this time ? 
  tractor units,

  shadowrun returns has a good plot . 
  it also has a framework for fan-made adventure modules hint hint . 
  ankh broke nda in csm5 ? 
  she lost her rl job . 
  or just jump clone back for a day . 
  4 hours respawn iirc . 
  they always respawn in the same system . 
  if you want to check out other systems with ice , [ use a map ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/the_citadel ) . 
  ice mining is best done in a [ procurer or retriever ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/ ) . 
  procurer is probably best if you like to keep your ship . 
  that 's because he 's playing his mentalist character . 
  not if you 're new to mining , no . 
  if you mean [ ads like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrmdpnudpzw ) , that 's a * very * credible aussie accent , with the possible exception of the first few words . 
  yeah aussies tend to pick up the american rhotic r when they 've been in the states for a while . 
  i hope she has recovered from the sucking chest wound . 
   ccp will support this project by giving out 3 x plex and 3x random industrial skins or pirate rookie frigates to each person who has tracks that are included in the release ( :, 
   thanks for the great idea !,

  it 's quite an old australian name given to some families in darwin in the early 1800s due to communication mix ups between immigrants and immigration officials . 
  ah fook is not actually their chinese name . 
  something similar happened to my family ; due to the confusion between surname / first name order in china vs australia , my family name is an obscure chinese first name . 
  neighbours cars do n't care about paperwork . 
  luckily , we can afford twenty bucks if we cbf voting . 
  it 's an option . 
  the current government has gone full retard , and their budget will not pass the senate while it still has such stupid stuff in it . 
  we voted the previous government * out * , not necessarily the current one * in * , if you understand . 
  does timer board do dust times ? 
  \\ #sickchoices, 
  nice one , frank . 
  one thing though ; just because a ship has multiple bonuses does n't make it intrinsically weaker ; look at the gnosis . 
  oh we 're * not * having this conversation right now . 
  but yeah , cantonese is the primary language spoken by the diaspora during the australian and californian gold rushes . 
  my family hails from sei yap back in the day . 
  well , we did put it back again when hawke got into power again . 
  we just do n't like charles . 
  however , there 's a good chance that charles will rule for one year then give it away to william , who seems alright . 
  pm sackings : only slightly less often than quarterback sackings . 
  well that escalated quickly . 
  you 're welcome to your opinion and i agree with most of it . 
  i 'm not so sanguine about your tone . 
  at least we have form for fixing lib fuckups . 
  if by beers you mean middies , then * maybe * six . 
   infact the only reason tony appointed him communications minister was to appease the moderate right within the party . 
  i think it 's more likely that he was appointed communications minister to push through bad policy and make himself less popular . 
  government puts out a budget ( tm ) . 
  this includes more spending on some things , and less spending on others in varying amounts . 
  to do more than tinkering with the numbers , e.g. 
  if the government wants to deny unemployment benefits until jobseekers have been 6 months out of work ^ * ) , then bills have to be passed . 
  bills go through the house of representatives ( which the government vaguely controls , otherwise it 's not the government ) , then it goes to the senate . 
  if the senate says `` yeah , nah fuck off '' then it goes back to the house of reps for amendment to something the senate would agree to . 
  if that 's not acceptable to the government , they can have another try , and if this also fails , a [ double dissolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_dissolution#trigger_event ) election can be called . 
  in a dd election , all federal seats are up for election at the same time ( usually it 's only half the senate seats at a time ) , with the idea that whoever 's more popular will pick up a majority in both houses and get shit done , or at least the electorate will punish whichever side is being the biggest dickhead . 
  minor parties that could n't get one senate seat from the 6 available in each state generally have better luck snagging a seat when all 12 are up for grabs , so dd elections are good for minor parties at the expense of major parties . 
  it 's incredibly unlikely that the present government will do this even though they 're likely to be granted a trigger , because their popularity has plummeted since they started showing the country what their policies actually were . 
  ^ ( * i 'm not making this up , this is a real bill ), 
  not yet , although it 's sometimes useful if you have a lot of corp members , since you can just say `` i bags hangar division 2 on component assembly array # 3 '' . 
  [ one more kiss , dear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6rrokdy-e ) for me, 
  perhaps i do n't understand , but why not join ncdot yourself ?
