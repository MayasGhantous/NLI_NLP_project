  this is n't some `` starter girlfriend '' situation . 
  i have one of these trees . 
  they are delicious . 
  frankly i 'd believe anything if there 's a hex editor picture in it . 
  i like the idea of skinnable shield colours . 
  a. mwd and paying attention is even better . 
  some stuff will get very expensive once stockpiles deplete . 
  jump freighter build cost is 2b over jita sell . 
  practically anything that needed process decryptors is now impossible to manufacture at a profit . 
  making the copies and invention costs have dropped through the floor . 
  manufacturing costs have shot through the roof . 
  but mostly because the difference between me-4 and me-1 is a lot more than the difference between me2 and me9 . 
  yes , not that it makes a substantial difference . 
  hey at least they 're trying to break out of the syndicate cemetery . 
  sadly , politically speaking , angry men are more palatable than angry women . 
  tldr ; `` lots of stuff in psychology is just the name we give something that already happens '', 
  augmentation too . 
  you * should * say it 's vdd . 
  get out . 
  who knows what 's going on with invention ; patch speculation is a dangerous thing . 
  for now , just stay away from purchasing anything t2 larger than frigates unless it 's undervalued . 
  nawt . 
  newstead brewery has some great beers too . 
  i hear it sometimes . 
   how ridiculous is the outback steakhouse gimmick on a scale of 1-10 ? 
  we do n't have those here , so i would n't know . 
  tippler 's tap in newstead is also great . 
  they sell good wings too . 
  more to the point , they get automated notifications whenever someone so much as shoots a structure they own , or puts up a tower in their space . 
  you 're on a community right now . 
  will there be an official devpost about this ? 
  ` invasion boys ' sounds like a great name for a band . 
  that 's implicit . 
  also , since a max-run bpc is now good for hundreds of invention attempts , the number of bpcs you need has been reduced significantly . 
  so , what term * should * the cop have used in that situation , had they known the correct terminology ? 
  i go to [ chinatown dental ] ( https://plus.google.com/105925887194363831915/about?gl=au&amp;hl=en ) . 
  it has good reviews .

  are you naturally this dense or do you have to work at it ? 
  all assault classes * already * have bonuses to their racial weapons . 
  it just happens that the minmatar racial weapons are split between projectile and explosive , so only half their weapons get a bonus right now . 
  firstly , is minassault really the fotm you claim ? 
  they 're second-rarest assault type in my experience . 
  can you explain what, 
   giving a whole new bonus to the fotm because it is not op enough, 
  means ? 
  if you take away the projectile bonus , then adding the explosive bonus still only leaves the min assault with half its bonus ; it just happens to be a different half than before . 
  clearly that 's not the intent . 
  small moves , ellie , small moves . 
  towers , force fields , engine trail colours , fucking cyno skins , i want it all . 
  looks like just the sort of thing that would go through a, 
  jump *** portal *** . 
   as always , a detailed report will be published traditionally in the meeting minutes format . 
  the traditional format is `` delayed to irrelevance '' . 
  i 'd prefer a less traditional format . 
  you do know what [ seagull management ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seagull_manager ) is , right ? 
  you 'll also need advanced cloak to avoid gal logistics . 
  you would n't by chance have that post/spreadsheet that was linked during the feedback thread on scout changes , graphically displaying the thresholds needed ? 
  i think of it from a technical perspective . 
  ccp is gaining experience with the unreal engine with dust/legion and valkyrie ; it 's more likely that stuff originally built for incarna will be stolen and reused in those games , with eve remaining as the ship game , and anything human-scale being the province of legion . 
  i speak from a technical rather than gameplay point of view because incarna * does n't have any * gameplay . 
  the way it was explained to me , gal scout needs 3 complex damps to get under anything , everyone else needs 2 damps + cloak ( and only while cloak is active ), 
  when there are no enemies , invent one ? 
  stats might get you a job in the gambling industry . 
  is there such thing as a capacitive load ? 
  and would running an inductive and capacitive load at the same time be better or worse ? 
  it 's the same as the eve one , although rounding strategy might differ ? 
  although , you can hand out the badges you do n't want to your friends who play eve . 
  if you do n't have friends who play eve , then just go to an eve meet up and force other players to amuse you in exchange for badges . 
  burst hmg * is * really good . 
  like a 40m shotgun . 
  why not go straight to ` pay dollar , get blink credit ' ? 
  if this means poe stops posting , it 's an acceptable loss . 
  have i mentioned how much i like these periodic updates from csm people ? 
  well that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  [ oh , i do n't know why , but i 've always loved the idea of somer ... ] ( http://brooklogun.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/olaf-in-summer.jpg ), 
  especially since it 's 100k * plus * a day job if you want . 
  elite : dangerous and/or valkyrie . 
   do you want to build a straw man ? 
  ftfy, 
  did n't see much press about this ; any changes in this build ? 
  down slightly . 
  somer encourages a few extra people to buy plex through them , but only if they sell them to somer . 
  so , somer has to buy fewer plex as prizes , so demand drops by a bit . 
  you missed out on the opportunity to call your post `` somer of rage 2014 '', 
  most grocery stores are more like 5-10 % . 
  if you really want to shoot faction npcs , try [ attacking convoys ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/attacking_convoys ) . 
  and as a new player , he knows about none of them . 
  what time zone do you play ? 
  cool , we have a few guys in molden heath . 
  the documentation i have is that bids within 15 minutes of the end time extend the auction to 15 minutes from the last bid . 
  it 's phase everyone goes through . 
  two geriatric alliances facing off with walkers and canes . 
  so yes , this is a massive dunk by their standards . 
   hey guys ,, 
   apologies for the delay in putting out a notification , i 've just arrived home from the office after a bit of a busy day talking to various departments to get a handle on how and what 's been going on with this situation . 
   this issue was first brought to the attention of the community team by the csm around 24 hours ago after concern was raised by members of the community regarding the promotion that 's currently going on over at somerblink . 
   myself and ccp leeloo has been sat with various groups within ccp today and have been in constant contact with the csm throughout the day to discuss the concerns of the community and make sure that some form of resolution is reached . 
  they 've been very clear , direct and unified with their opinion on the situation , and this is a sentiment that i share with them .
