   this thread will serve as a place where we 'll be updating you guys on what 's going on with this to make sure that there 's a central place for information , because it 's quite clear that this is an issue that the community is taking seriously . 
  it 's also something i feel incredibly strongly about . 
   at this point in time , we 're investigating exactly what 's going on with the whole situation , and i 've been in contact with our legal department , sales and our information security team with a view to having this looked into and resolved . 
   given the sheer size of the investigation that we 'll be undertaking , this is going to take some time , as a lot of isk and assets have changed hands . 
  while some temporary action has been taken in order to keep a handle on the situation , any outcome of an investigation is still to be determined , and i ca n't give any further information regarding the process while it 's ongoing . 
   there 's not a great deal more that i 'll be able to give you guys tonight , but please be aware , and rest assured , that you will not be stonewalled over this , and within reason the community team will be letting you guys know exactly what 's going on as and when we can release more information . 
   i 'm hoping to have more on this for you guys tomorrow as we look into this further , but for now , this is just to let you all know that your voices have been heard , we 're actively looking at the situation , and will feed back as soon as we have more information that we can share . 
   we 'll be locking all the other threads that are discussing this , and diverting them here to keep feedback concise and centralized in one place , so please feel free to use this thread to talk about the issue openly . 
   just remember to keep it civil and within the forum rules , which also means no discussion of warnings and bans . 
   thanks for your patience ,, 
   ccp falcon | | community manager | | @ccp_falcon, 
  followed by a bunch of csm people bandwagoning . 
   the csm has been really on the ball here and ccp responded within a day . 
  especially since it was a weekend where half the csm were on planes to iceland . 
  so they got on those planes for nothing ? 
  that proposal says they offer the same price to everyone for the plex . 
  this is misleading , since they only state that it 's available to people who buy plex from them . 
  yeah , but potato salad is funny . 
  unless [ you 're a model ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/9uwbxzg ) . 
  early humanoids who made bad choices never successfully raised children . 
   its not only that , they fought off the chinese with their militia . 
  the regular forces were fighting the khmer rouge in laos . 
  so you 're saying that vietnam is an especially dangerous pho ? 
  they say that good reddiquette is to restrict posts about your blog to at most 10 % of your total posts . 
  however , while this means that allegedly i * can * post about my blog 350 times without repercussion , it does n't mean i * should * . 
  edit : also , being sneaky about it does n't help matters . 
  [ there 's no such thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjytkd2kt-w ), 
  agreed . 
  the way skill point costs increase , seriously consider whether you * really * want that skill to level iv or v until you have a few million sp under your belt . 
  heck , unless you have enough isk to run prototype suits , any suit skill over iii is probably better spent elsewhere . 
  high sec players have votes too . 
  market orders and industry jobs will continue being active while you 're unsubbed , or at least they did last time i unsubbed for a bit . 
  if you have to ask ... 
  sigh, 
  eoh poker has all-in games that are much like blink . 
  eve-bet . com allows you to bet against other players for anything ; alliance tournaments , rl games etc. 
  winners share the pot , minus a few percent for the house . 
  we do n't begrudge him the affiliate income . 
  however , we are dead-set against him offering incentives to do so . 
  yeah this could have been averted by saying `` we 'll buy your plex at market prices '' and actually meaning it . 
  the thing is that he got greedy ; he could have done it many ways legally :, 
  * if you enter this special promo code when you purchase from our etc seller , we will not only pay you market price , but we 'll put up a buy contract as soon as we can on a priority queue just for vip customers . 
  often , the contract will be up before you even redeem the plex !, 
  how 's that for convenient !!!!, 
  define loss ? 
  blink pulls in ~ 30k per year in referral link money , and pays its eve employees with isk from its eve winnings . 
  both in-eve and out , blink is profitable . 
  how not to get a job , lesson # 1 : post jokes on the internet that would affect your employment status . 
  the traditional instructions are :, 
  do n't look at the needle, 
  keep distracted by conversation or whatever, 
  make sure your fluids are up and you 've eaten vaguely recently ( some people feel faint if they get a fasting blood test but are fine if they had a meal within the last few hours ), 
  it 's trendy and tasty , that 's all . 
  shit , it 's way better than the focaccia bread craze of the '90s . 
  samarco ii in middle park is a cafe with an ex-hilton chef running it . 
  it 's seriously underrated . 
  i especially like the special menus for valentines day , mothers day etc. 
  i do n't know the answers to your questions , but you 're [ having fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kltuxml.jpg ) so keep at it . 
  it was eyeopening going to sydney as a kid and seeing turkish bread everywhere instead of focaccia . 
  ( then it was wheatgrass then rice paper rolls then pork belly then frozen yogurt then quinoa ... ) i mean , sure , they 're all good food items , but i had n't realised just how trend-following people are . 
   hey guys ,, 
   we 're aware that somer blink has posted a message to state that their services are shutting down . 
   we 're also well aware that a lot of members of the community have enjoyed playing somer blink over the course of the last four years , and it 's very unfortunate and saddening to see a source of enjoyment for our players closing its doors . 
   in the same respect however , we believe that the promotion that caused this issue was not representative of the original proposal that was brought to ccp . 
   given that we 're unable to provide reimbursements as per section 1.3 of our reimbursement policy , it 's good to see that somer blink is shutting down in a controlled and stable manner , and that players will be able to withdraw their isk and / or assets . 
   while we will be monitoring this closely , we have no intention of interfering with this process , as we feel that allowing players to be able to have their assets and / or isk returned by somer blink of their own free will is an important part of bringing this situation to a solid resolution . 
   we 'll have more information for you guys tomorrow , once myself and ccp leeloo get back into the office and speak to the relevant people , including the csm . 
   this remains a top priority for the community team , those involved in other parts of ccp , and the csm . 
   thanks for your patience while we work on bringing this to a close . 
   ccp falcon | | community manager | | @ccp_falcon, 
   channel motd : somer blink | http://cogdev.net/blink/, 
   announcement on the site . 
   refunds are in progress . 
  it 's going to take time - there was ** 1.4 t on deposit ** when we closed shop . 
   thank you all for years of getting to do this . 
  it was a great experience , and a majority of you were awesome people to interact with . 
   this channel is closed now . 
  1.4 t is a lot , and that 's not counting all the isk somer has made over the years , presumably in a stockpile the size of dbrb . 
  presumably he 's closing shop now to avoid forcing ccp 's hand and risk more sanctions . 
  does it really need to be a job though ? 
  how much time does it take , considering there 's a bunch of people employed by somer who do the in-game contracting and procurement tasks in exchange for isk . 
  it 's not pool-based ? 
  that 's his right , though ? 
  i mean , it 's his money , he can spend it how he wants . 
  not just ccp ; i know i 'd get out my credit card and sell a couple plex if there were a spike to 2b isk . 
  standard menu [ is here ] ( http://www.samarco2.com/menus.php?menuid=1 ) , but there 's usually chef 's specials as well , which are definitely worth tasting , 
  have eaten most of their dishes , even their kid 's bolognese is good ; only problem is that there 's just too much food to choose entree + main for each person without being too full , so most of the time we just go main + occasionally an entree shared between two . 
  i have 2.5 m sp saved up but i still seem to run around with adv scouts , even with md/smg fits . 
  the passive scan and damps on a scout is just so good for md play . 
  after all , the md excels at killing scouts , so it really helps if you can see them on scan , 
  i sometimes mine ice , but it 's just for something to do while i 'm messing around with orders or working out other stuff . 
  it 's not exactly high-risk/high reward play , but hey , some people just like to fish . 
  for ice mining , i usually use a [ procurer ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-04-at-9-45-01-am.png?w=655&amp;h=451 ) or [ retriever ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-04-at-9-48-08-am.png?w=655&amp;h=442 ) . 
   it 's ** not ** exactly high-risk/high reward play, 
  * http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/, 
  * http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/exhumers-in-kronos/, 
  procurers , if fit well , are really hard to kill . 
  if that 's what makes you happy , keep doing it . 
  they could , but that costs them money ( ie someone can now avoid a month worth of subscription ), 
  using existing plex is better , since you know that someone definitely paid some cash to create it .
