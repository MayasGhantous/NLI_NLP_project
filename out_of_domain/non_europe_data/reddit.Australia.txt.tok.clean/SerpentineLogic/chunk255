   does the minnie assault bonus apply to the md ? 
  sadly no , although there 's a [ thread about adding it ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=169536 ) . 
  pharmac prohibited from covering certain drugs , allowing prices to be deregulated . 
  and yet , gina disposed of her galilee basin holdings a while back . 
  she knew which way the wind was blowing , and it 's not in the direction of new coal mines . 
  yeah , but not all coal sold by australia is coking coal . 
  for instance , [ galilee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galilee_basin ) is worthless if nobody wants to buy thermal coal . 
  it 's a gift . 
  you may want to add to your recruitment ad which region ( s ) you operate in . 
  iirc the email addresses were already replaced ; i doubt the real names were removed though . 
  none of those three points are specific to pensioners . 
  the real reason is :, 
  * pensioners vote , and this issue would see the libs lose the 2pp in that entire demographic . 
   jester 's ramblings about eve online , mmos , gaming , geek philosophy , and -- very occasionally -- darius_johnson . 
  seems fair . 
  after all , the default solution to anything in null is `` bring more bodies '' . 
  sadly , even with scrapmetal reprocessing v and a 4 % reprocessing implant , you 'll still only get 55 % of the mineral value from stuff you loot . 
  it 's probably better to just buy a station container and throw everything into it and deal with it if it ever fills up . 
  to be fair , with so many people kneeling , someone was bound to say '' while you 're down there ... '', 
  by turning it into old news by election time . 
  old news has a way of being dredged up during election time and presented as something novel . 
  this timing , it 's old enough to not be an issue , while recent enough that people actually remember it being old news . 
  as an australian , you yanks are all seppos . 
  wait , you 're not a csm . 
  also foxes , eh , what ? 
  you can pay people isk to do eve-related stuff . 
  like , for instance , write words about eve . 
  you are n't allowed to pay people isk to do non-eve related stuff , so tmdc does n't pay isk for articles about tanks . 
  also , the people who receive the isk are not the same people who give money to tmdc , so it 's not a rmt transaction . 
  tldr ; no, 
  literally / r/bravenewbies, 
  what does buying plex have anything to do with it ? 
  as an eve player , i have no idea what ccp were doing by acquiring white wolf instead of just licensing the ip for their mmo , which turned out to be a cf anyway . 
  that was legal . 
  it was the inducements for plex referral that got him in trouble both times . 
  its not an eve related service you 're hiring someone to do for you . 
  probably , yes . 
  as bill gates found , it 's really easy to be generous when you 're the richest person ever . 
  i 'm starting to think this is some kind of obscure performance art on his part . 
  the memory hole school of historical revisionism . 
  it works basically [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py2cksmkt1m ) . 
  iambic pentameter or gtfo . 
  i also accept [ old english epics ] ( http://fiddlersedge.blogspot.com.au/2011/09/fever-dream.html ) . 
  i think it 's obvious . 
  pend insurance is backed by somerset mahm . 
  the only person i know who makes third party devs as happy as fox four does , is stoya . 
  nope . 
  i use the back of the spoon around the edge to make a clean cut , then straight into the recycling . 
  circle jerk australia . 
  it 's a real subreddit . 
  australia wins ? 
  have you never used the bolt pistol ? 
  bolt pistols are n't bolt action , they 're automatic pistols , even if their rate of fire on low . 
  [ kinda maybe but not really . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4pb4copph0 ), 
  yeah . 
  this was pushed hard by rental alliances and provibloc and it 's a good idea imo . 
  no , it was basically businesses of varying types . 
  their rates changed so that electricity was cheaper , but they 're now charged $ 500/day to ` read their meters ' . 
  so , if they use more power than normal , it does n't cost much more , but if they , e.g. 
  put up some solar panels to save power , they 'll still be hit with the 500/day charge so it wo n't save them very much . 
  dust 514 has a single officer-grade suit . 
  compared to top-tier normal suits it has :, 
  * +25 % fitting room, 
  * +20 % more shields ( it 's a caldari suit ), 
  * +1 low slot ( caldari suits already have maxed mid slots ), 
  * +1 equipment slot ( no real comparison but it 's probably about as good as having an extra utility high + covert ops cloak ability ), 
  when you 're talking about smelters and factories and stuff , yeah , you can go through a lot of power . 
  yes . 
  even hitting up your neighbours and washing three cars a month is faster than the 1-030 hours of grinding needed by a new player . 
  last time i drunkposted , i compared ccp foxfour to stoya . 
  you know what you have to do . 
  organise a sausage sizzle next election and rake in the money while providing an essential public service . 
  i 'm serious . 
  ever tried halal sausages ? 
  they 're awesome . 
  it went * okay * . 
  my first ever petition was when i lost 5 hobgoblin iis to a random disconnect . 
  ccp reimbursed me , so i was pretty happy about it . 
  where are you doing missions ? 
  the em reinforcers wo n't do much if , for instance , you 're in lonetrek doing caldari missions . 
  the standings thing works everywhere , but sov null had the extra restriction that needed removing . 
  then probably 2 thermal and one kinetic rig would be better . 
  i suggest either a tracking enhancer , a magnetic field stabiliser , or both in the low slots . 
  if you ca n't fit both , just use an overdrive system , they 're quite easy to fit . 
  in the missing mid slot , you 'll probably want a propulsion module for moving around quicker ( or trying to get far enough away from stuff to use your rail guns effectively ) . 
  personally , i never got into the whole railgun thing ; i would have [ picked up a corax ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/retribution-corax-pve-fits/ ) and gone for missiles . 
  maybe try putting your api key into eveboard instead ? 
  go here : https://support.eveonline.com/api/key/createpredefined/59645960, 
  create the key , call it something like ` eve board ' so you know where you 're using it , then paste the id and key into http://www.eveboard.com . 
  not sure ; last time i checked , the thread was full of shit posts from goons . 
  perhaps you can suggest it to fox four . 
  thread is locked ; guess he got what he needed , 
  i do n't suppose op could spare a web to kill drones with ? 
  op , you okay ? 
  apparently his drones get chewed up , vov . 
  less likely but still plausible . 
  meh , pve players like getting into bigger and better ships . 
  it 's how they think they 're levelling up . 
  rounded up , all of it .
