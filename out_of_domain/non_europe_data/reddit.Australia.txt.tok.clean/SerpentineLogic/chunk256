  last one was the new eden open . 
  chruker has some of his site , on the materials themselves . 
  do n't know how recently it was updated . 
  somer already had a small army of in game employees . 
  a few of them would just be retasked . 
  it helps if the corp you join has a blueprint library . 
  5 percent profits does n't leave room for unresearched stuff . 
  this beats trebor 's spreadsheets with a stick . 
  maybe someone on / r/oculus will let your grandfather use their dev kit ? 
  i 've seen youtube videos of ww2 vets using the rift , sounds like something he would get a kick out of experiencing . 
  if he really wants that rmt money i 'm sure he 'd put the effort in . 
  op is just braggin ' . 
  source , and request for help :, 
  everyone knows that avatars taste like [ dates ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnyg1ftmiu ) . 
  the program should be able to work out the minimum value to research the bpo to that level though . 
  ring mining was an alternative way to source moon goo . 
  while it 's a neat thing , it 's probably something still best kept up ccp 's sleeve until really needed . 
  it * was * really needed two years ago , while the tech bottleneck was in full force and before the moon goo rebalance . 
  now ? 
  not so much . 
  it 's a nice to have , but not critical . 
  do n't forget the ring pirates . 
  as an ex sydneysider , queenslanders really do speed a lot . 
  render eve ships in a web page , like caldari prime pony club site does . 
  so , what skills have you trained so far ? 
  i hope algester is fibre to the home ... 
  nothing has ere come out of ccp 's mobile apps team . 
  i suspect the team is comprised solely of employees waiting out their three month notice period before they can leave . 
  ccp 's historical tendency to announce things before they are anywhere near completed is the reason why ccp seagull has clamped down strongly on pre-announcements since she took power . 
  yes , but the fitting bonus is less important when you 're carrying cheaper equipment , and if you 're at less than 10m sp , there are definitely more important things to spend your sp on than getting level iv and v of a specialised suit like that . 
  he has a coercer , so an arbitrator is probably a more reasonable choice for him . 
  so how do you fly this ? 
  i 'm guessing from its fit , it 's designed to fly away from enemies at an angle ( keeping within the maximum range of 20km using standard s ) , picking off the small ships one by one , before switching to multifrequency s ( 10km range ) and starting on the larger ships in a close orbit with mwd off . 
  with everything firing , your cap will last somewhere north of 30 seconds but less than 60s , but the armour repairer sucks a lot of cap and hopefully you wo n't need it once you reach your optimal range . 
  same with the mwd . 
  if cap is still a problem , consider attempting to fit a small electrochemical capacitor booster and carry a bunch of cap booster 200s . 
  it will use a lot of cargo space ( at least initially ) but you 'll be able to last a lot longer . 
  you may not be able to fit it at your skill point total , though :(, 
  where exactly ? 
  the shire ? 
  has a nice ring to it . 
  yeah , nothing like buying a flagon of beer to start a weekend right . 
  fair enough . 
  what racial logistics are you going for ? 
  btw most equipment types are a lot better at level 3 if you 're wondering . 
  do you have some skills in core upgrades ? 
  or shield or armour ? 
  step 2 is ` more psssh ' . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  ccp ca n't use aurum for actual stuff that impacts their bottom line while there 's still massive stockpiles of arum sitting around . 
  extra character training for a month is * worth * a plex , but does n't * replace * a month 's worth of subscription money . 
  perhaps in a few year 's time , you 'll be able to buy plex ( or game time ) with aurum , but not while there 's 1.5 b aur remaining from the great aurum giveaway . 
  has got ? 
  that 's not formal english ; it 's colloquial at best . 
  depends on the equipment . 
  most do not . 
  hope the progress means it catches up to elite . 
  that game is looking better each week . 
  i remember jumping onto a depot last night and wondering why i was n't getting resupplied . 
  manufacturing ties you down geographically ; i suggest you re-task a trade alt for that . 
  remember that you can stash the stuff in a far-off station and start the jobs remotely if you have the correct skills trained . 
  yes , but you will hate yourself ; with starting skills , you 'd be grinding away at a computer game for 40c per hour and wondering if the fun will ever start . 
  in this hypothetical scenario , do i get to be a director ? 
  the traditional response is `` wash your neighbour 's cars , because if you ca n't reliably find $ 15/month for a computer game , the solution is not to play that game * even more * . '', 
  well , if you like a challenge and are willing to put ( a lot of ) time into it , knock yourself out . 
  most players who accomplish this do it via trading , but if you 're keen you ca do it via faction warfare complexes or scanning down signatures in exploration and hoping for a big find . 
  the world thinks that this really did n't need to be in three subs . 
  depends what you 're looking for . 
  some organisations , like aideron , will say `` okay here 's 50 million isk/month salary , i want these things built by the end of the week '' which is i guess vaguely okay for some people . 
  others , like my corp , are laissez-faire ; use our corp facilities and blueprint library all you want , but we 're not going to tell you what to do . 
  when i say laissez-faire , i really mean it ; we 're not into handholding . 
  it might be rough for a beginner , but the way we think of it is that [ the corp ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/2dv3v1/setenta_corp_is_hiring_builders_scientists/ ) is like a library . 
  there 's books for everything ; it 's up to you to work out what you want to learn , where the books are , and how to read them . 
  technically , i guess it ** is ** a library ; a blueprint library . 
  this corp is mostly pve or industry alts ; most of our mains are in other corps in the alliance . 
  well , if you 're carrying 20b of blueprints , then you need to either, 
  * hide them ( unscannable blockade runner cargo hold ), 
  * hide yourself ( cloak ship , ideally cloaky brick t3 ), 
  you 're better off jumping straight to low sec and getting to your destination using the jump drive . 
  i guess this is vdd 's move op ? 
  seriously , do not autopilot a blockade runner . 
  not to put to fine a point on it , but it seems like your troubles stem solely from your side of the family . 
  perhaps it 's time to reassess the relative importance of your wife/life together , and the expectations of your family . 
  not so tanky , though . 
  oh , well * done * . 
  if there 's anything that this subreddit is good at , it 's being unprofessional .
