  do you know which part of australia you wish to go to ? 
  it 's easier to compare universities within one state , than across the entire country . 
  enterprise software development . 
  someone has to fix all those n-tier non-distributed systems vov, 
  this thread has a strong prophet motive . 
  on the other hand , when you finish work on monday afternoon , knowing that you just made your clients $ 80m , it 's reasonable to consider how much business value you delivered vs what you receive , in a different light .

  you 're staying for a year rather than the entire course , so it may not be applicable to you , but many universities have engineering degrees with one or two 6-month work placement semesters , where you take university part-time while working as an undergraduate engineer . 
  i highly recommend these courses . 
  you may not know , but most be degrees in australia have a vacation practice requirement of ~ 18 weeks over the 4 years of the course . 
  it 's paid work , working under an accredited engineer , and generally taken during the end of year break . 
  it may be difficult for you to take this , what with not being a citizen , but it 's both good for your professional development , and potentially your bank balance , since even 65 % of a graduate engineer 's salary is a lot when you 're in the mining industry , 
  u melbourne also has an [ international house ] ( http://www.ihouse.unimelb.edu.au ) ... 
  i think you know the answer to that question . 
  as an outsider , perhaps institutions that took a long time to get where they are , take an equally long time to change for the better . 
   which was odd because my corp/alliance is 10 regions away : p,

  +1 for the guy in the audi , 
  i 've heard of them offering mints and water , but that 's really going above and beyond . 
  i imagine it 's a good way to rack up driving km if you sal sac for a leased car , though . 
  yardbird 's wings are bigger or smaller depending on the whims of chance , but the surly service is a constant . 
  enough for him to repurchase his self-respect . 
  probably better to give them back to ccp when the next plex4good charity event happens . 
  i 'm sure ccp gets tax breaks for it . 
  minimum karma ? 
  or , how long they 've been a redditor . 
  plenty of people use septic tanks instead of mains water supply . 
  it does not change the fact that mains water is a utility . 
  we call these people scientists . 
  api keys have a lot of credibility . 
  ccp devs run dust on pc . 
  then again , they can recompile from source ,

  and that ai n't bad . 
  i love the head shot bonus , but my zoom :-(, 
  i 'm on 2mb/s , and unreliable at that . 
  i would pay four figures for 100mb/s or more . 
   and since i do n't play, 
  not for me vov . 
  i went through six consecutive trials before i bit the bullet and subscribed . 
  you can use the same email address each time , but if you want the same character name , you must delete the old character before your trial ends ( there 's a ten-hour timer for deleting characters , so bear that in mind if you 're nearing the end of your trial ), 
  tldr what is red frog . 
  how are you going to get these items moved without using contracts , regardless of who does the moving ? 
  unless you want to fly to each station and use the trade window,

  commit to not subbing again until the next plex 4 good . 
  donate to the [ angel project ] ( http://www.sindelsuniverse.com/the-angel-project/ ) and let sindel worry about that . 
  you can tell if you 've lost connection by typing in a chat window . 
  if you can type two chat messages in a row , you 're connected , but if you ca n't send the second message , you 're not . 
  the nerds in / r/evetech will know how to help .

  meh , i 'd go max int , the rest perception . 
  there 's a good six months of support skills you could train that affect any ship you ever pilot , but a newbro still needs to skill into weapons and ships at least a bit . 
  after your support skills are acceptable , then you can flip into per/will for a year . 
  these days , we like to have the additional authoritarian axis to provide more nuance . 
  if you analyse the market , you 'll notice that many items have weekly price fluctuations as well as minute-to-minute changes . 
  not knowing whether it is appropriate to comment has never stopped me before . 
  elite dangerous ? 
  er , it 's more about what * ca n't * be fit to a certain ship , beyond the obvious cpu and power grid constraints . 
  it 's a very small list . 
   building the t2 products is not all that great, 
  like , building quantum microprocessors or whatever ? 
  fyi , copying cap components is ultra-fast now . 
  kinda not worth selling . 
  five years is a long time to work for one company .

  safari, 
  well , you can do it in [ excel ] ( https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/2014/07/26/excel-and-crest/ ) ( [ or google docs ] ( https://github.com/fuzzysteve/eve-googledocs-script ) ) if you want , or use something like eve-mentat if you prefer a standalone program for it ? 
   are dust players using the eve online market ? 
  they buy from the market ( presumably hidden npcs ? ) . 
  they can not sell to the market . 
   can you , as eve online player , trade these items ? 
  dust was ` meant to ' have a player market , but it was never implemented , despite being told that it was the easiest way to link eve and dust together in a meaningful manner . 
  then dust got cancelled and the devs waltzed off to develop evez legion . 
  do not negotiate with terrorists . 
  yeah , i work with a bunch of them .
