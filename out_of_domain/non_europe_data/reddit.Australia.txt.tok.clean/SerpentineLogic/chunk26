  i think theres more though . 
  it 's all detailed in [ the guide ] ( http://www.isktheguide.com ) . 
  check it out . 
   i 've been reading things about pirates in `` low security zones '' . 
  what are these zones and are they actually policed by players ? 
  they 're not * actively * policed . 
  if you attack someone in lowsec , any nearby gun turrets start shooting at you , but you 're largely on your own . 
  shoot people enough and you are barred from high-sec space . 
   what are planets for ? 
  extracting resources using planetary colonies . 
  some things you can youtube for :, 
  eve butterfly effect, 
  eve causality, 
  eve dominion trailer, 
  clarion call ( 1 , 2 and 3 ), 
  then you probably should follow [ these ] ( http://fulldisclosureeve.wordpress.com/ ) [ blogs ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/ ) . 
  the trick is to choose a ship type that is so popular that a t2 bpo could n't possibly keep up with demand . 
  sentinels trade so lightly that a single inventor can flood the market . 
  on the other hand , the number of hulks bought each day would take dozens of characters inventing non-stop to fill , so the effect of a hulk bpo is negligible . 
  as if he ca n't work his magic from behind the scenes anyway . 
  the chairmanship was just icing on the cake ( admittedly , very nice icing if you like being interviewed all the time ), 
   being able to locate parts of your body like that is a sense . 
  it 's as much a sense as being able to find canada on a map . 
  intrepid crossing . 
  you 're putting up an amarr tower in highsec , installing a bunch of assembly arrays that have marginal utility compared to a station , you have no provision for defenses and your single lab is manifestly inadequate for a single-person corp , let alone 80 . 
  i do n't think you 've done your due diligence . 
  then you 're going about it the wrong way . 
  making a proof of concept pos is fine and dandy , but an unspecialised pos setup like that will likely fail because there 's no value proposition in the services it provides . 
  better to put up a medium caldari pos loaded with advanced labs and ecm jammers to offer your corpies a compelling reason to use it . 
  so the ends justify the means ? 
  it was a * friendly * shovel to the head . 
  naga * please * . 
  so , i guess the third time you login , it 's finished ? 
  australia does n't have english as the official language because * fuck * the poms . 
  [ my head ] ( http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/jackie.jpg ), 
  try, 
   pve is a pointless grind of passive mobs floating around aimlessly and spawning in waves , with pathetic loot and payout, 
  might i introduce you you incursions . 
  old . 
  when he says `` kill yourself '' , he 's speaking from experience . 
  i played baldurs gate . 
  i know what you mean . 
   please do n't let soundwave in this room ... 
  it 's tuxford you have to worry about . 
  he quit the csm chair . 
  then ccp banned him for 30 days , which implicitly makes him ineligible for csm7 . 
   i think the only real power he has is to get interviews in the media . 
  fyp, 
  as if that would make a difference . 
  summary : lots of nouveau riche from doing incursions , and a lot of vets slowly liquidating their isk stockpiles ever since incarna . 
  steam has a cheap deal at the moment . 
  and yes , you can just let the account lapse and resubscribe later . 
  ( i think you need to submit a petition if you want to put it on hold while there 's still subscription time remaining ), 
  a study once got people to estimate how long three minutes was , without access to a clock . 
  there was a strong correlation with age and time actually elapsed , indicating that time appears to speed up as you age . 
  i do n't think you 've thought this through . 
  have you * seen * the other guy ? 
  a little bit * less * closer now . 
  canadian healthcare is not terrible . 
  since there 's no agreement between the au and ca governments , a similar canadian couple would be slugged the same amount if they had a premmie baby over here . 
   `` the newspaper said the castrations were regarded both as a treatment for homosexuality as well as a punishment for those who clergy accused of sexual abuse '', 
  sentence starts off misguided-but-well-meaning , then takes a ** big ** left turn towards evil . 
  it 's the hair . 
  gets me every time . 
  some stuff you sell to npc orders . 
  the background intel i have is this :, 
  * sw : tor is so terrible even bob could n't stand it . 
  you might like to [ read this ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/sons-of-bitch.html ) then . 
  jester also has a multi-part incursion guide that you will find useful . 
  you forget the concept of jackpots . 
  draw # 1 : people pay $ 7m in tickets for $ 5m prize pool , nobody wins , jackpots . 
  draw # 2 : people pay $ 7m in tickets for $ 10m prize pool . 
  because you did n't play in the earlier draws , this is suddenly good odds . 
  from the point of view of the lottery commission , meh they 'll make money regardless . 
  and smartbombs . 
  so brave . 
  just hang around the high-sec incursions first ( you need to know who to trust before joining a fleet of randoms and heading into low-sec ) . 
  i got enough invites even when i had all skills at iv . 
  also , logi v is * so much more * important than shield and energy emission systems v. 
  meh , tech 1 shield rep drones are sufficient . 
  heck , sometimes i just run with mining drones for the lyavite . 
  long walk to jita, 
  are you rich enough to fund multiple ship losses ? 
  ** if yes : **, 
  do coordinated wormhole diving from a highsec home base . 
  this is your entry point to a permanent wormhole presence , with the advantage that you gain experience with probing skills and how to do sleeper sites while being able to dock up in a station when you 're finished for the night . 
  ** if no : **, 
  skill up for incursions , run them as a team ( fleet with randoms to make up the numbers ) , gain isk to spend on wormhole ships . 
  the ones i consider the most useful are [ collected here ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/tag/broski/ ) but you can just [ go to the source ] ( http://nekoarcnetwork.com/bro/res/9221.html ) . 
  ps i will be very surprised if you actually make good on your 50m isk promise . 
  the hauling one , or the [ jump freighter one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/shkc0.jpg ) ? 
  makes pictorial guides, 
  runs out of bandwidth, 
  ok , here 's some i tracked down that are hosted . 
  to be fair , there 's lots of * everyone * on reddit . 
  to be fair , since australia is a younger country we got to avoid a bunch of that unpleasantness . 
  still , the stolen generation indicates that doing bad things does n't require ill intentions . 
  yeah insured battlecruisers will do fine for a c1 . 
  just remember that sleepers target drones more often as the wormhole class rises . 
  not sure .
