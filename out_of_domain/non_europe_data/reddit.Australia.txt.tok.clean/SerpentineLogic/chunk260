  china probably has more law students than australia has people . 
  [ the cactus and succulent, 
  society of queensland ] ( http://www.cssq.org.au ) will know . 
  there 's an event in october ... 
  have you considered doing a 1-zone trip during your lunch hour on mondays through wednesdays ? 
  that will save you almost sixty dollars a week . 
  a new player will cap out using that . 
  they need a medium shield extender instead . 
  it wo n't be a straight conversion . 
  if you really get stuck , do n't be afraid to scan down a wormhole and escape that way . 
  dump it in your neighbours bin then . 
  [ sorry , no .

  good thing people ca n't play eve while having a browser open to shit post on . 
  bacon , maple syrup and pancakes are delicious ; why not ice cream ? 
  or making sense , it appears . 
  it 's legit . 
  you may find this more enlightening . 
  well , you can always start with exploration , which is a mostly solo profession anyway , while you 're working out who to join for some fights . 
  i do n't know much about fw , but i hear good things about aider ( gal ) and pie ( amarr ) corps . 
  i admit very little sympathy for jr in this video . 
  check iinet ? 
  fyi \u00f0 is pronounced ` th ' as in ` that happened ' . 
  in contrast , \u00fe , which is also icelandic , is pronounced ` th ' as in ` thor ' ( although icelanders have their accent so it sounds more like ` torr ' ), 
  turns out i had a spare 3 day omega , i guess i 'll burn it this weekend ... 
  there 's no in-game support for coalitions per se , although alliances can set good/bad standings to minimise blue-on-blue incidents . 
  but really , when you 're talking about the level of organisation needed to operate a sovereign space holding alliance , you 've probably already grown the expertise to tie alliances together using shared communications and authorisation frameworks . 
  well , i did this :, 
  then i did some missions , but got bored after a while then headed to low-sec to seek my fortune . 
  eventually , i found my way to null-sec life , then faction warfare , then into industry . 
   please dont down boat me, 
  no , but it 's decent isk for a new player , and you get to travel throughout all factions ' space , so it 's quite pretty . 
  do n't get attached to your ship . 
  they 're not armani suits , they 're disposable pens , to be used and lost with few regrets . 
  it 's especially important to remember that you 're using them to harvest enjoyment , not to work a second job earning space money . 
  she already got out of thermal coal . 
  you mean , the easiest industry on the planet to work remotely ? 
  message me with roughly where you are , maybe i can suggest some quiet low sec systems nearby to cut your teeth on . 
  i expect more types of event now , as long as the results can be determined by checking their database . 
  also , they do n't have anything to lose at this point . 
  i believe ten matches over the weekend is sufficient . 
  i thought it was a rudd scheme , actually .

  icelanders wearing someone else 's skin as pants , complete with coin in their nut sack for good luck . 
  such is life . 
  at the very least , i 'd be interested in viewing scans of them , since i have n't even seen any eve tcg cards . 
  hmm , minmatar space . 
  i know of a few groups there , like [ capital punishment ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/capital_punishment./corporations ) , which hang out in low sec molden heath , although there 's a few groups in faction warfare , like [ lna ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/late_night_alliance ) . 
  i see . 
  hmm , how about the facwar training corp , [ late night academy ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/late%20night%20academy ) ? 
  it 's just as good . 
   and i believe evil always eventually loses . 
  it goes back and forth , but in the end good always triumphs . 
  but in the meantime ... :(, 
  paging / u/mangalasolaris - make this a next drunk night roam theme ? 
  rockvegas is a great place to come from . 
  staying there , not so much . 
  looks like it got buffed a bit later in the thread . 
  six people in my year did n't graduate from year 12 because they were caught committing armed robbery . 
  another six did n't graduate because they were pregnant . 
  all this from 165 people ...

   hey everyone !, 
  as ccp seagull mentioned in her coming in oceanus dev blog , we 're following up with interceptors and interdictors this release to apply some more polish . 
   the most significant bits in this set of interceptor changes are the adjustments to the crow and malediction ( which are a bit too good in their light missile configurations currently ) and the raptor ( which has been struggling to meaningfully distinguish itself from the venerable taranis ) . 
   one important module tweak that applies significantly to these ships ( we 'll be discussing it in more detail in an upcoming module balance blog ) is that in oceanus light missile launchers will have their rate of fire decreased by ~ 6 % . 
   crow :, 
   replace the 10 % per level kinetic damage bonus with a 5 % per level missile explosion radius bonus . 
   +1 highslot, 
   +1 launcher, 
   +5 cpu, 
   malediction :, 
   restrict the missile rof bonus to only apply to rocket launchers, 
   raptor :, 
   -1 highslot, 
   +1 midslot, 
   +5 cpu, 
   +51000 mass, 
   ares :, 
   increase small hybrid tracking bonus from 7.5 % to 10 % per level, 
   -40000 mass, 
   +40 capacitor, 
   +30 s capacitor recharge time, 
   stiletto :, 
   -10000 mass, 
   taranis :, 
   -10000 mass,

  warwick reminds me of another shit place outside rockhampton , called mount morgan . 
   hey everyone !, 
  as ccp seagull mentioned in her coming in oceanus dev blog , we 're following up with interceptors and interdictors this release to apply some more polish . 
   these interdictor changes are fairly minor as we consider the balance of this class fairly healthy . 
  they are mainly aimed at helping the eris , heretic and flycatcher compete more strongly against the sabre for applications where combat ability matters . 
   one important module tweak that applies significantly to these ships ( we 'll be discussing it in more detail in an upcoming module balance blog ) is that in oceanus light missile launchers will have their rate of fire decreased by ~ 6 % .
