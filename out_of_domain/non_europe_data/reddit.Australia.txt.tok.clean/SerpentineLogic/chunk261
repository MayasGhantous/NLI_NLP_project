  the absolute first thing you should do is, 
  * read the sidebar to your right - , 
  you guys and [ vipr ] ( https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vipr-vr-treatment-for-veterans-with-ptsd/x/3959853 ) should collaborate .

  hail the immortal emperor of mankind !, 
   all the single m ` ladies, 
  aest represent !, 
   odds are it contained rennet made from veal calves, 
  not lately . 
   by 2008 , approximately 80 % to 90 % of commercially made cheeses in the us and britain were made using fpc . 
  [ 1 ] today , the most widely used fermentation-produced chymosin ( fpc ) is produced either by the fungus aspergillus niger and commercialized under the trademark chy-max \u00ae [ 10 ] by the danish company chr . 
  hansen , or produced by kluyveromyces lactis and commercialized under the trademark maxiren \u00ae [ 11 ] by the dutch company dsm . 
  animal stomachs and bladders make great bags . 
  it seems inevitable that someone would store their milk in one and discover that it turns into cheese or yoghurt . 
  does this work on ispud ? 
  in gallente space , the only corps i know who are newbie-friendly are in faction warfare . 
  what do you want to do ? 
  still mining , or do you want to set that aside and roll up a new character ? 
  how about faction warfare ? 
  pvp if it 's available , good income if it 's not available . 
  they did , although for whatever reason , development of aura stopped a year to two ago , so i use evedroid these days . 
  eve is real , 
  face aiming is great for people who have spinal injuries btw . 
  a more insightful way to rank them is by how big the debt is , compared to gdp . 
  ( it 's okay to have a large government debt if you also happen to have an equally-large number of people and/or high gdp produced per person ), 
  by that ratio , any country with a nation debt of < 30 % of its yearly gdp is doing okay . 
  rise recently tweeted that he got a big idea green-lit , so looks like a big shake up is likely . 
  at this point , names will carry over , and sp will carry over , although the new sp system is still being worked out so all they can say is ` progression will be transferred ', 
  i think legion on pc actually has a chance , unlike a hypothetical dust on the ps4 . 
  having said that , i 've seen a lot of engagement from the dust devs , but fuck-all from the legion devs , which leads me to the inevitable conclusion that they have n't learned the correct lessons from dust . 
  the design work should already be fleshed out by now . 
  we do n't expect working graphics , but we 'd expect them to know how the game is * supposed * to work by now . 
  case in point : [ war barges ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lvm0l ) were already worked out long before programming ever started . 
  do n't be fooled , the buzz for valkyrie pales before the buzz for elite dangerous . 
  [ a further 325k kills in 8 hours ] ( https://twitter.com/ccp_frame/status/513279000672608256 ), 
  probably equipment assembly array . 
  sent, 
  in poker parlance , when he thinks about asses , he has a * tell * . 
  for a long while , all standard towers and anchorable stuff were only available pre made , from npc sellers . 
  yes , ten games . 
   as long as you had your booster active at some point during the event period , you will get bonus sp . 
  we did that last time , and will do so this time as well . 
  [ source ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2364832#post2364832 ), 
  i guess it depends what you 're doing . 
  how much isk are you making per game , and how much are the skill books you want to buy ? 
  personally , i make < 50k per game on average , but that 's because i do n't need the income . 
  if i were running ultra-low cost suits , i 'd probably clear 230k per match instead . 
  it 's not exposure that helps westerners drink safely , it 's just [ genetic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aldehyde_dehydrogenase ) . 
  a phobia is an irrational , disproportionate fear . 
  it 's irrational to fear muslims . 
  in fact , it 's still irrational to have a phobia against terrorists , seeing you 're incredibly unlikely to encounter one in your entire life , so you would n't be triggered . 
  so , '' [ you 're either with us or against us ] ( http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html ) '' ? 
  no , you can still make them from blueprints in stations . 
  and the blueprints are still sold by npcs so are impossible to eradicate . 
  if you get more war points , you can fairly comfortably get 300k per match . 
  medic is a very good idea for a starting character . 
  a light frame with an injector and repair tool is good , although ammo plus repair is also popular . 
  the first sentence of that article literally links to the one i referenced . 
  whatever you want . 
  having multiple equipment slots is nice . 
  and yet other genetic groups like the chinese and japanese have up to multiple thousands of years of alcohol use and still have a genetic disposition to flush reaction . 
  this implies that alcohol tolerance is n't something that measurebly affects genetic selection the way vitamin dust absorption or lactose tolerance did . 
  it was at the time . 
  all i do against n9n is use explosive weapons so they ca n't be needled . 
  isk victory  actual defeat . 
  perhaps you can use that 10b isk you were stockpiling per month to wipe your tears . 
  traders who cap out ust move to more trade hubs . 
  researching and selling , or just selling copies ? 
  probably more like the reddit api approach . 
  `` use it for free , but if you hammer it , we 'll ban you forever . '', 
  the zulu shook hands with their left ( shield ) hand , to show that if there were treachery , both sides would die . 
  either way works , i guess . 
  no ; ` win ' is what 's left of the name if you ca n't pronounce ` ng ', 
  uyen = ` win, 
  i did n't even know you were dating . 
  installation fees should be based on the time that the line is being used , like they used to be pre-crius . 
  if the install cost is 5m isk ( +10 % tax ) , then putting it in a pos with -50 % time should also reduce ( halve ? ), 
  the install cost ( and allow for some of that profit to be recouped by the corp ) . 
  similarly , a bonus te team wo n't be as good as a bonus me team , but it will pay for itself most of the time . 
  ( btw this applied to research , might also ameliorate some of the ridiculous costs ( and some of the ridiculous time ) of getting a blueprint from me9 to me10 . ), 
  boosters only work on the first million . 
  yes , you could both stab each other with the spears in your right hands . 
  they 've been mixing it up for a while ... i recall crucible being by hazar,

  no blue intel , you salmon . 
   i 've just sat down and finished an interview with ccp leeloo , ccp falcon , mike azariah and steve ronuken , ** it 's less than an hour long ** so you should definitely go listen now, 
  setting a high bar , i see . 
  very carefully .
