  the best deal is still to create an account from a buddy link . 
  your buddy has the ability to apply a plex directly to ** your ** account , so that avoids any problems ( since he gets a plex back when your account changes from trial to subscribed ) . 
  if you know the login details you can activate hours4plex , kick off the biomass , then raise a petition ( using email ) to get ccp to complete the biomass procedure 10 hours later .

  where ? 
  well , generally high-sec ( 0.5 + ) is where most people start mining , although if you have a decent corporation supporting you , you can skip low sec and go straight to 0.0 space . 
  as for which ore to mine ? 
  there 's a [ site for that ] ( http://ore.cerlestes.de/#site:ore ) . 
  looks like kernite is pretty good for high-sec . 
  as for when ? 
  whenever you feel like it . 
  most people mine while they 're doing other things , like sending eve mails or managing their market orders or browsing imgur . 
  whatever works . 
  as for what to mine in ? 
  well , a [ venture ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/venture ) to start with . 
  tech 2 miners are a big step up . 
  if you 're serious about mining , then you 'll probably go to a mining barge next ; many people decide to specialise in combat instead .

  there 's a corp list on [evedownunder.com ] ( http://www.evedownunder.com/index.php/autz-corp-list ) which is pretty cool , but even if you do n't immediately jump into a corp , there 's still a bunch of chat channels you can hang out in full of aussies . 
  i tend to hang out in the whirlpool channel , myself , but there 's others that are more general . 
  [ this one . 
  ] ( http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/eve-keyboard.png ), 
  for one thing , there 's a difference between static typing and * explicit * typing . 
  static is fine , but always needing to write the first bit of, 
  list < tuple < string , long   tuples = new arraylist < tuple < string , long   ( ), 
  is redundant given modern code inspection algorithms ( see lombok plugin for java ides . 
  for the rest , i 'll just cut and paste [ from this ] ( https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/the-next-secret-weapon-in-programming/ ) :, 
   if we want to compare static and dynamic typing , we need to make best-in-class comparisons : what is the best that can be done in each paradigm ? 
  comparing ruby or lisp to java or c++ is not fair ; a better comparison would use haskell or ocaml , both of which have implicit typing as well as parameterized and algebraic data types -- these concepts are not as `` advanced '' as they sound -- to represent static typing . 
   java 's type system simply is n't very powerful or useful . 
  java actually contains two type systems , meshed together into an unsettling chimera . 
  one of its type systems is bottom-up and vaguely algebraic , consisting of a few primitive types ( integers of varying sizes , and single - and double-precision floating point numbers ) and arrays of existing types . 
  that 's it . 
  it has int and double [ ] and char [ ] [ ] but can not represent anything more interesting ( tuples , strings , variants , parameterized types ) . 
  to represent those more structured types one has to use java 's other type system , which is top-down -- everything is a subtype of `` object '' , and each variable stands not for the object itself , but to a reference to what might be an object of that type , or none ( null ) . 
  the nastiness of this can not be overstated . 
  java 's notorious nullpointerexception , a runtime failure associated with dereferencing a null pointer , is both a common and ( from a debugging perspective ) a usually-quite-useless error . 
  java 's type system lacks the power to verify that a string variable , at compile time , will actually hold a string , and not null , a value that must be handled specially by any method that takes a string ( ditto , for any other object type ) as input . 
  the string type is not available ; you must make do with what is , in fact , a ( string option ) ref -- a mutable reference that may hold a string . 
   java 's type system catches some errors at compile time , but not enough of them , most programmers feel , to justify the pain of using its type system . 
  no language can eliminate runtime failures , but statically-typed languages , used properly , can make them very , very rare . 
  java 's type system does n't have enough power to achieve this ; it merely makes them somewhat less common , but not enough to justify the required , explicit use of an ugly , underpowered type system . 
   the type systems of languages like ocaml and haskell are far more powerful , allowing user-specified algebraic types . 
  also , explicit typing is usually not required ; the compiler infers most types using the hindley-milner algorithm . 
  although ocaml and haskell programmers usually explicitly type their api-level functions -- this is just a good practice -- they do not suffer the overhead associated with explicitly typing inner functions and variables as in java . 
  code development is almost as fast in haskell or ocaml as in a language like ruby ; no worse than 10 or 20 percent slower , a difference easily made up for by the reduced debugging time . 
  if you want to write better code on the jvm , use scala . 
  why did n't you drop the egg closer to downtime ? 
  buy a lot of plex , and make it rain next time plex4good comes around . 
  er , since crius , the default t2 blueprint copy comes out at me2 , te4 . 
  there was also a one-off boost to all blueprint copies when crius hit , which was nice . 
  play around with [ this ] ( http://eve-industry.org/calc/ ) and see what the numbers do .
