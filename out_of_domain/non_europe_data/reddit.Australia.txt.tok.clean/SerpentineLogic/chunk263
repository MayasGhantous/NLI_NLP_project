  maybe use hours4plex to check api ? 
  or just activate hours4plex then login and check yourself . 
  well , they 're likely to get a kickback from their buddy , so they can go out and get attribute implants themselves . 
  last time someone subscribed from a buddy trial i have them a full head of +3 implants , 500m isk and a bunch of skill books . 
  [ here 's one i found . 
  ] ( http://foo-eve.blogspot.com.au/p/recruiting.html ), 
  that 's a really clever title . 
  seriously . 
  more out of alliance people means less control , under occupancy based sov . 
  do n't you have a list of blueprints at the bottom ? 
  just click on one , it should load into the square slot . 
  the idea is that neutral ( cloaked ) alts in a system have a chilling effect on activity . 
  you first . 
  [ different html ] ( http://www.notquitelegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/silicon-valley-i-know-html-437x230.jpg ) . 
  the whole * point * of being a corrupt cop is that people ( like wineries ) pay you money to stay the fuck away from them . 
  because there 's a convenient road built into the top of the wall , so it makes sense to keep building the wall instead of randomly stopping it and starting it . 
  great wall mortar is amazing stuff . 
  the rice flour they mixed in is the key . 
  but , i thought the adults are now in charge ? 
  the laws of physics say that in any collision between a mazda 2 and a hummer , the hummer will win . 
  that does n't mean that you should n't buy a mazda 2 , or that larger cars should be allowed to do dangerous or unfriendly manoeuvres just because they 're bigger . 
  drop his director role , tell him to logoff , then re-add it ? 
  [ ] ( http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/turn-it-off-then-on-again.png ), 
  what goes around , comes around . 
  you 're no longer limited by industry slots ; just by the number of active jobs * you * can run . 
  i 'm just relieved to see he 's still able to walk ( albeit with a limp ) , according to the statement released by his family . 
  wherever you draw the line , they crossed it when they tried to sell people stuff using someone else 's designs without giving them a cut of the proceeds . 
  just take them from sound cloud ? 
  when product owners add stuff to my sprints , i ask them which other ticket to take out . 
  give it all to sindel pellion and she 'll [ give it away ] ( http://www.sindelsuniverse.com/category/the-angel-project/ ) for you . 
  who trains that to v anyway ? 
  you only need it to iv to fit a hymen ii in a low slot . 
  justified chaos claims to have the biggest auz presence ... 
  this sounds so much better in french . 
  minmatar cattle bruisers have sick alpha . 
  i take back my previous comment . 
  *** this *** is * much * better in french . 
   do you consider this capability in terms of cost and time commitment to be game breaking , reasonable , or too hard/boring ? 
  no , because you 're not good at it . 
  a switched-on carrier pilot should be able to make multiple round trips from a single pair of cynos , assuming there 's fewer than two mid points . 
  i defer to your french-sounding username . 
  two cynos requires one friend with a cyno alt ( two if you do n't have a second account ), 
  it 's not * that * high a bar . 
  most npc null is pretty shallow . 
  the ` npc ' bit is a red herring . 
   should taking omist from someone be impossible if you do n't stage an entire alliance out of a pos , or fly 30 + jumps for every op ? 
  maybe you should take and hold some space a * bit * closer than 30 jumps away then .

  from february this year :,

  the dps-fit stealth bomber ( sans the actual bomb launcher ) is a staple fit for ratting when you 're trying to build up your sec status . 
  wish i could do this :, 
  the death cloning issue is solvable , now that it has been raised i 'm willing to wait and see . 
  i 'm looking at judicious use of gates in dotlan now , since i 'll be sixteen cynos from empire . 
  ps if you want to model the changes , a dreadnought with zero skills jumps 5 light years . 
  max skills after = unskilled moros today . 
  what 's the bet that the ` variable distance from a wormhole ' change gets applied to gates as well ? 
  `` do n't know if i 'm elated or gassy , but i 'm somewhere in that zone ... '', 
  also : see / r/evetech, 
  ... but you repeat yourself . 
  malcanis also implied that this was the tip of the iceberg . 
  well , everyone is entitled to a hobby . 
  home owner associations : home to all the banal fascists who never made into a position of real authority . 
  also , do n't forget that australia , due to having no land borders with other countries , gets to be incredibly picky about who they choose to let immigrate there . 
  for instance , a large number of us immigrants enter because they 're related to a now-naturalised citizen ; that proportion in australia is vanishingly small . 
  well , that 's not an insolvable problem . 
  high-rise apartments do exist . 
  it 's just that not enough people want to live in them for many of them to get built . 
  totally unlike your fake [ calling for reps ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/2i8zlc/i_have_to_broadcast_for_reps_on_my_pod_here/ ) bullshit . 
  glass houses , mate . 
  or / r/evetech, 
  do you have sufficient roles in your corp to actually set up jobs ? 
  try changing the installation to be more specific ( i.e. 
  the array , preferably the hangar division with the bpo or bpc in it ), 
  why not start with t 2 blueprints of doctrine modules . 
  i do n't know what this is but i 'm excited anyway !, 
  a bad case of the trotsky 's . 
  if you 're under heavy fire i.e. 
  it 's not whether your tank will break , but how long until you explode , your shields wo n't have enough time to make up the ehp difference between shield extenders vs armour plates using regen . 
  if you 're new to pvp , then i highly recommend being a ` ship of the line ' , i.e. 
  just another ship to deal damage . 
  it 's by far the easiest role , because your fc will tell you what to do . 
  once you have some experience under your belt you can branch out into whatever takes your fancy , be it scouting , tackle , logistics or e-war . 
  raise a ticket with eve support . 
  last i heard , it cost rl money to make the switch . 
  i do n't think examples like this are representative of the racism/xenophobia level of queensland . 
  qld racism is generally more casual and subtle than that . 
  that 's a lot of compressed eggs in one basket . 
  it 's especially useful if you run newer versions of eve probe on the same computer as you ran the last one , since it 's a straight matchup of the improvements they 're testing in the code . 
  but why not get the same info from a third source , then get blackmail material as well ? 
  i 'm not saying it happened like that , but it 's not crazy to entertain the possibility . 
  i love how optimistic you are that you will ever finish a roam in the next four years . 
  username checks out . 
  vdd is the autz corp with the most people who actually * undock * , so there 's that . 
  why not message him and ask ? 
  well , you can use my link if you want . 
  it 's the [ first one on the list ] ( https://github.com/everedditbot/eve_reddit_bot/blob/master/eve_buddy_link_bot_links.yaml ) . 
  the gervais principle at work . 
  probably means diversity of options . 
  if you only know how to use lasers , then when you come up against something that 's highly resistant to lasers , you 'll have a hard time .
