  there 's only one ship that has bonuses to any weapon type ; it 's called the gnosis , and it 's a pretty cool ship to use as a newbie , but that 's about it . 
  use pulse lasers instead of beam lasers then . 
  such is life when you do n't have a shoebox . 
  no matter what race you play , you 'll end up training at least light drones to v , as almost all large ships have drone bays . 
  i highly recommend it training for tech 2 light drones . 
  depends what you 're fighting and how big your drone bay is , but generally you fit smaller drones because your ship guns can handle larger targets without missing . 
  rarara uses the dust forums as a test bed . 
  it looks the same , but is a fair bit better than the stock eve forums . 
  then you can fit whatever you want , even a couple heavies if you really want , 
  need to get across the galaxy for a timer ? 
  use this fit to ride the jump bridge network just like old times . 
  90 % reduction of jump fatigue means you 're back down to zero 30 seconds after your 1 minute jump timer ends . 
  which tz, 
  or a couple of interdictors each , for delaying the cap fleet that 's chasing you via gates . 
  on the other hand , how much money would you save by going there , compared to working then using that money to pay for full price dental treatment elsewhere ? 
  ordinary edition is just the book . 
  limited edition has [ a nicer box ] ( https://store.eve.com/detail/index/sarticle/127 ) . 
  that was crucible . 
   you can make a big one and eat it ** over a couple of nights **, 
  you filthy casual . 
  read it again . 
  then wait for / r/evelegion, 
  so , probably all valkyrie , no legion . 
  yes , countries like singapore thrived under a benevolent dictator ( it 's still a one-party state ) . 
  however , if that dictator had been less than benevolent , then they 'd be in pretty bad shape . 
  and that 's not forgetting other countries getting all up in your business , like indonesia , where sukarno got a lot of help from the russians , and was inevitably deposed by the usa-backed soeharto , and heaven knows what 's actually going on since then . 
  no it does n't . 
  the thing to watch is what happens after they leave parliament . 
  getting a cushy job as payback for all the favours you did for an industry is pretty damn close to corruption . 
  most likely . 
  yeah , the [ teshkat pocket ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/tash-murkon/sukanan ) is pretty good for newbies . 
  i do , and i also have this issue , but i do n't think that 's the reason . 
  do you like melamine resin in your milk ? 
  because [ that 's how ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_chinese_milk_scandal#melamine ) you get melamine in your milk . 
  after that melamine scare that went on for years , i do n't blame you in the least . 
  i get uht milk that 's lactose free , because it 's often cheaper than the fresh lactose free milk , and i can buy multiple dozens of them when they go on sale without worrying that they will spoil . 
  op is bear grylls . 
  they try harder . 
  good fucking luck getting that past customs . 
  when xenosis * reaper * thinks you 're a huge shitposter you must be p bad . 
  minimum wage is a nominal fee . 
  i still would n't be happy living on it . 
  which time zone . 
  all i know about estonia can be summed up as, 
  * really close to russia, 
  * everyone has blue eyes, 
  * top national export appears to be beautiful women, 
  you could , yes . 
  note that there 's a maximum number of import xml calls per spreadsheet , so you 're better off [ importing a script ] ( https://github.com/fuzzysteve/eve-googledocs-script/blob/master/evecentralprices.gs ) instead . 
  the limit is imposed by google . 
  just load in the script , and call it with a range of cells , and it will interpret the itemids and go get the data in one batch . 
  thai in sydney is a lot more widely available than in brisbane :(, 
  imma let you finish , but i do n't believe that eve developers are so disconnected from feedback from the player base that a middleman is necessary . 
  this is true . 
  if you want me to do something i want to do anyway , then i 'll do it for free . 
  if it 's something i do n't want to do , then it becomes a job , and i already have one that takes up my time , and whatever number of plex you 'd throw my way would n't get you much of it . 
  writing books about project management ? 
  op seems like he has read * a * book about project management . 
  ironically that 's the name of a management paper that op has n't read . 
  can you confirm or deny that one ccp dev got his job in part because he worked out what the 514 in dust 514 means ? 
  ah yeah , the much crying old experts corp. 
  yeah , too much tongue . 
  i note that / u/eveaficionado and / u/evedevelopersunion are the only supporters of this so far , so i 'll leave this thread be for a bit and see how broad the support base is for this half * connecting-developers-with-eve-projects-that-need-help * , half * needlessly-interfering-by-forcing-blanchard-s1-behaviour * thing . 
  so will you ever tell us what it stands for ? 
  assault suit bpos . 
  wow . 
  i agree , / u/wogmafia . 
  ge-8 out, 
  unlike anzac alliance , scrapheap flotilla , aif and all the other quasi military names of aussie alliances ... 
  he must have seen some shit . 
  the price was too darned high ? 
  confirming that bacchanalian is the best mittens lookalike of all time , plus an all round nice guy . 
  ( edit : just donated ), 
  my sources in b0t have heard this rumour . 
  how real it is , we 'll that 's open to interpretation . 
  well , at least he has form . 
  i will also accept ge-8 rekt . 
  i 'm fairly certain that the dislike of the chaplaincy project is that it 's * not * accountable . 
  afair , the funding was n't accountable ; it all went to one particular church group , instead of being handed out depending on how many chaplains you actually had out there . 
  also , chances are you 're white , so racists wo n't target you . 
  woefully incorrect . 
  npc null is terrible for industry . 
  you need sovereign upgrades . 
  maybe he just had a lot of roses to give away . 
  i see some good fits on fail heap with a small ancillary ripper but mostly relying on plates . 
  1 plex . 
  bonus video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mer-hyti0bk, 
  message me in a month . 
  bunker crude has few uses besides fuelling tanker ships , so yes it 's very cheap . 
  has your friend considered moving to another , more accepting country ? 
  surely a mech eng degree provides a good amount of mobility . 
  they did n't say never , just that they will only release client updates a few times each year . 
  i have no special offers :(, 
  then again i 'm subbed , so ... 
  you have been banned from / r/elephants . 
  raise a support ticket asking whether you can be gifted an extra 10 days . 
  the worst they can do is say no . 
  so , a lot like eminem , then . 
  turn off gatekeeper , it corrupts the download after ~ 5gb . 
  faction-fit recon of any description .
