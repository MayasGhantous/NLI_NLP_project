  i know about as much as wikipedia and / r/todayilearned on the subject, 
  that 's not 100 % bad though . 
  why climb everest ? 
  you 're not thinking enough steps ahead . 
  1 . acquire blue quafe ships, 
  1 . sell some blue quafe ships at substantial markup, 
  1 . sell list of people who have bought said quafe ships . 
  then one day you alt tab back to find you 're in a pod . 
  just one of the useful skills i have picked up playing eve . 
  brb buying a certain book en masse . 
  aristocratic eve players use vms, 
  minmatar faction war ? 
  or just join anyone in syndicate ; capital escalations are n't uncommon . 
  i 've been there . 
  it 's pretty cool , but somewhat ~ ~ cramped ~ ~ cosy . 
  that 's not a chart of nocxium . 
  perhaps you meant [ this one ] ( http://eve-tools.org/productcharts.html?itemname=nocxium ) ? 
  still does n't seem very accurate though . 
  anywhere but syndicate . 
   there are too damn many kids on reddit, 
  you do n't get to say that unless you heard those phrases when * you * were in ` nam . 
  does n't change rose throwing that sapphire back into the ocean . 
  according to recent sale threads ... 
  be a dick . 
  quote [ stolen from world war 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_daly#.22do_you_want_to_live_forever.3f.22_quote ) , as it turns out . 
  autocannon maelstrom , i imagine . 
  ctas are n't * too * bad , as long as they 're in moderation . 
  however , sounds like op has ctas that also are n't reimbursed either , which is totally not cool . 
  if your ops are n't reimbursed , scale back your involvement to match your wallet . 
  fly interceptors or stealth bombers or something . 
  ask your ceo about a reimbursement scheme . 
  if they 're dragging you into fights for alliance goals , they should be helping you out . 
  loot everything after a fight . 
  if you 're especially misanthropic , loot everything * during * a fight . 
  pretend you 're in the old nc and rat while everyone else is on ops . 
  robert jordan kinda had to , since he was practically on his deathbed when he did it . 
  if he 'd been hit by a vehicle instead , he 's have no prior warning to get stuff disseminated and the series probably would n't have ended so neatly . 
  grrm is to be commended for lowering the [ bus factor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bus_factor ) for the tv series . 
  tornados do the dps and have the speed , but machs are way more resilient ( i.e. 
  can actually take a hit ) . 
  i think if you flew a mach like you 'd fly a tornado , you 'd fly them too cautiously . 
  might i suggest you reassess your alliance , then . 
  my alliance is dirt-poor but they at least chip in for drakes etc. 
   2 . there is no reimbursement scheme in this alliance , apparently it is because we are in drone space . 
  that 's a weak reason . 
  the drone regions are swimming in minerals ( especially nocxium  if they ca n't spare the time to build a few replacement ships , there 's something seriously wrong with their priorities . 
   pretend i 'm what ? 
  [ northern coalition ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/northern_coalition_%28player_coalition%29 ) . 
  known for being massive carebears , but generally nice people . 
  they ended up getting smashed because they kept selling supercaps to their enemies until they were too afraid to use their own . 
   are koala bears dangerous ? 
  do you realise how much arm strength is required to nonchalantly hold yourself vertical on a tree trunk all day ? 
  and that 's ignoring when they drop onto you . 
  that goes double for sydney nightclubs . 
  ha , no . 
  well , not all the time . 
  it 's pretty rare . 
  luckily , this is countered by gaijin smash . 
  no need to be scared of spiders - there 's a funnelweb antivenom , and redback spider venom takes hours to be fatal so you 're in very little danger in an urban setting , provided you get medical attention . 
  but stay the hell away from the snakes . 
  90 % of snakes you 'll see will be harmless . 
  the other 10 % will kill you before you make it to hospital . 
  the thing you have to realise is that even the trees are out to kill you . 
  eucalypts are self-pruning , so they 'll randomly drop huge branches ( like , 8 inches across ) that can be fatal if you happen to be standing under them . 
  but , like shark attacks , they 're fairly rare and aussies learn to be nonchalant about such things . 
  in the greater scheme of things , you still take more risk upon yourself by driving to the shops or stepping into a wet shower enclosure than braving the wildlife . 
  walladingaroos do n't exist . 
  they 're just an ~ ~ urban ~ ~ legend , like the wendigo , the bunyip and the wollongong . 
  also , while we 're on the subject of urban legends , they * do n't * have traffic police on the sydney harbour bridge to let kangaroos cross over . 
  well , not since the early 80 's anyway , when sydney became too urbanised for roos . 
  wolf creek . 
  film that says it 's based on true events . 
  actually * is * . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.outpostnine.com/gaijin_smash/2005/02/gaijin-smash.html#more ) [ seems to work ] ( http://www.outpostnine.com/gaijin_smash/2006/12/why-dont-you-try-to-kancho-back.html ) . 
  seems legit . 
  this program made me want to goebbel up a big mac . 
  that 's why you wait until your fc is primary before uncloaking the noctis ... 
  not everyone is willing to stump up for a slave set , so the + cap recharge is a nice perk for rear-echelon ( carrier/jf/rorqual ) capital pilots . 
  he is obviously a master wizard . 
  the eve eula takes a dim view to buying characters directly with rl currency . 
  however , as long as the lol account can be sold without issue , then you could trade it privately for eve game time cards , then cash * them * in for billions of isk and buy a character that way . 
  auschwitz you would stop using that joke . 
  * mining up to level 3 ( next system over has an ice belt , or do level 4s in nearby ikao ), 
  * distribution up to level 4, 
  * security missions up to level 4, 
  12-year olds ? 
  meany-faces ? 
  definitely . 
  that makes sense . 
  they certainly do come from out of nowhere . 
  a large shield extender and an invuln let me tank battleship rats while i belt salvage . 
  the noctis has a * ridiculous * shield recharge rate ... 
  i believe eve is like $ 6.80 on sale on steam at the moment , and there 's also 75 % off coupons floating around . 
  so , that 's 44 days playing time for a very cheap price . 
  but yeah , this is the type of game that if you reach the three month mark , you 'll likely be playing for years . 
  that wormhole guy was awesome . 
  so even talocan united would n't take you ? 
  if your nullsec alliance ca n't bully its way into some lowsec moons for income , they 're close to failure cascade already . 
  irc .
