  max player count is about 4000 so yeah , a few . 
  i 'm in boggo road prison right now , no joke . 
  yes . 
  this is making it difficult to get to you guys right now . 
  not much of one . 
  work party , why not in a jail ? 
  much drinking , why not sleep it off in a cell ? 
  i admit it 's a bit rough without mattress tho . 
  bonus points : it 's movember so everyone looks like uncle chop-chop . 
  fracking toasters . 
  zero chance of that at this stage . 
  or maybe he has been uploaded to the sleeper virtual consciousness but nobody told him yet . 
  people ? 
  it 's debatable . 
  characters ? 
  yes , ccp has confirmed it multiple times . 
  over 50 % of all characters will be in high sec at any point in time . 
  everyone has a high sec alt , on one account or another . 
  it complicates stats . 
  dominion and causality come close , but yeah i agree , best trailer of all time . 
  of all time . 
  well , you 're here with us instead , which is still p. good . 
  i had to change my user agent from safari to chrome to view it ( stupid youtube bug ) , but it looks so . 
  damn . 
  good . 
  are you on os x ? 
  youtube [ fucked safari ] ( http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/21/yosemite-10-10-1-youtube-safari-issues/ ) about 8 hours ago . 
  you call it ` regularly starts lagging for a few seconds ' ; i call it ` internet in australia ' . 
  or maybe they just do n't feel it 's worth the hassle . 
  i would pay five bucks a month just for abc 4 kids . 
  well , a lot would be up for buying high quality eve themed porn for isk as well , but that does n't mean ccp has to help . 
  either way , he should be manning the bbq at the next eve down under . 
  i suggest / u/ccp _ prawn because he is delicious with teriyaki sauce .

  / r/evenewbies, 
  plex are a billion isk each right now . 
  makes it easy to skip the isk grinding ... 
  for help with the real basics and to get extended trials , check out / r/evenewbies . 
  the go-to corporation at the moment is / r/bravenewbies , but there are others , such as eve university , / r/evedreddit etc. 
  clearly i am still hungover from last night in gaol . 
  it turns out that noses are very close to mouths . 
  or fleets of mining ships in null sec , or ninja mining using a covert ops mining frigate in low-sec , or gas mining to fuel your combat booster drug operation ... 
  or just mining a bit in highest while waiting for your manufacturing jobs to complete . 
  it 's definitely not the same one as my combat character . 
  do you want massive cross-training , or just enough for pirate faction ships ? 
  because minmatar frigates give access to dramiel and daredevil , but frankly all the racial frigates are fast to train compared to the support skills . 
  you can , however , cancel your ongoing subscription as soon as you pay , so you do n't get charged again at the six month mark . 
  ccp will warn you when you 're running out of time . 
  maybe not in south australia . 
  if you liked planescape torment back in the day , you 'll love wasteland 2 . 
  have been on beenleigh line , can confirm , they 're barely functional . 
  there 's a bot on / r/evenewbies that hands them out . 
  you can turn off the sensor scan , i believe . 
  it is something that you can start on day one , but is highly dependent on access to a wide range of blueprints to choose from , as the most profitable one changes a lot as people band-wagon onto it . 
  this is something that an industrial corporation will be able to help with . 
  you could always [ join pushx . 
  ] ( http://www.pushx.net/index.php ), 
   the sensor overlay is controlled via the [ scanner button ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/64721/1/radialmenu.png ) in the ship hud ( head 's up display ) . 
  when you press the button you encounter a new radial button menu . 
  from there you can enable or disable the sensor overlay by pressing the eye icon on the top . 
  you can also access all the specific scanner tools directly from there ; probe scanner , directional scanner and our beloved moon scanner as well . 
  remember that you can reuse the trial links and take another trial after your first expires ( sadly , so will your trial character , unless you want to delete it so you can reuse their name ) . 
  when i was trialling eve , i made about six trials , trialling how lasers play , or missiles , or drones , etc. 
  til, 
  click ` show all ' for the full list . 
  as someone with a little bit of experience in these things , escaping into an mmo does n't help . 
  however , you may find that writing programs for an mmo may give you a boost . 
  er , you do know that a miasmos can haul up to 63000m ^ 3 of ore , while having lots of slots and rigs for tanking ? 
  i suggest getting the second account into another barge , then train up leadership skills to boost your mini mining fleet . 
  generally , it 's better to have 2 miners than 1 miner + orca boosts , so eventually you will make a third account and turn the second account into an orca support . 
  penny arcade called it a multiplayer treachery simulator . 
  fair enough . 
  the cia ' efforts in south america are well known . 
  of course conspiracy theories will grow when there is actual evidence of conspiracy in the past . 
  i disagree . 
  stick to your roots and take back some market share of reddit . 
   that 's probably why all the good leaders left . 
  just tell them you have a titan . 
   i found that shop http://www.virtual-items.eu/[1] which offers plex in dollars so it 's like 3/4 of price on official page . 
  so is it legit or some type of scum ? 
  it is a scam . 
  chances are that you 'll pay money , and either wo n't get your items , or will get them taken away by ccp when they find out and close down the site . 
  set a skill to training . 
  in fact , fill up the entire 24 hour queue . 
  you can always insert stuff at the front later . 
  oh , and also , do a neural re-map . 
  try not to do * solo * pvp while you 're learning ; better off being a ship of the line and doing what you 're told until you learn to avoid the basic mistakes . 
  so , a basic tech 2 tank ( google it ) and tech 2 guns . 
  stuff for incursions maybe ? 
  i do n't know , i make my is from patch speculation . 
  yeah , / r/evedreddit / is open for recruitment . 
  if not , then try / r/bravenewbies . 
  eve can be played on a modem ; it enforces a max bandwidth of 28.8 kbps . 
  eve can also be played on laptops , but be prepared to dial down the graphics a bit . 
  you can play up to 3 characters with the one account ; just not at the same time . 
  many eve players end up with two accounts for this reason . 
  some people have dozens . 
  they 're crazy but hey , they pay their subscription fees so why not .
