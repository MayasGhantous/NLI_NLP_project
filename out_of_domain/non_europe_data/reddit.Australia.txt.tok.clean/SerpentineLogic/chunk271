  there are extended 21-day trials available ( e.g. 
  [ this one ] ( https://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=d4513ea1-7716-470a-8c8f-a9eb0fa1cae8&amp;action=buddy ) ) ; or you can do what i did , and go through months of trial accounts using throwaway characters to get a really deep feel for what 's on offer in eve , then make a ` serious ' account and subscribe after exploring all options . 
  i went through six consecutive trial account before biting the bullet . 
  considered selling some characters for isk ? 
  but yeah , if you run incursions then you should be able to plex one account without issue , with lots of time left over to do pvp . 
  if you want a smaller group that 's bittervet-friendly , then i suggest the, 
  [ failheap recruitment forum ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/forumdisplay.php?21-recruitment ) . 
  fair enough . 
  the 21-day trial i linked can be reused multiple times without problem . 
  there was , but it stopped in june . 
  however if you can login to your account on the eve web site there might be deals available . 
  i recall there being a ten free days offer recently ... 
  very few items in eve are not player created , so you have come to the right game . 
  some attribute implants would help . 
  they 're about 8m isk each , but there 's cheaper ( and more expensive ) versions available . 
  * cybernetic subprocessor - basic, 
  * ocular filter - basic, 
  * memory augmentation - basic ( optional ), 
  * neural boost - basic ( optional ), 
  * social adaptation chip - basic ( really optional ), 
  you can , by improving your focusing muscles , but only to a point . 
  have you tried turning on the tactical overlay ? 
  it depends how much you want . 
  i mean , last week i set up some capital ship invention jobs and built some tech 2 components , so i see no need to login for the next week or so . 
  others have play styles that are conducive to nolifing . 
  it all comes down to whether you consider the time and money well spent . 
  to be fair , homeworld was voted game of the year *** in 1999 *** . 
  a webifier , as it were . 
  human cells are way , way larger than e coli . 
  it already does , / r/new _ eden_link_bot, 
  is thus working ? 
  i do n't see any links . 
  yeah , i heard it had some similarities . 
  as you can see , buddybot has given you my trial link . 
  when you create your character , let me know its name and i can spot you some isk and answer any questions and/or point you in the right direction . 
  have you seen the captions on the this is eve trailer ? 
  you may want to investigate setting your own captions ... 
  i 'm australian , so it could be awkward ( your evening is when i sleep ) . 
  i 'll scrounge up some info now , while i 'm still vaguely coherent . 
  ok , let 's take it from the top . 
  * http://www.isktheguide.com/ is an unofficial manual for eve . 
  it 's a bit out of date because someone injected meth into the developers and they have been releasing updates on a six-weekly schedule for the last few months . 
  * do you like tutorial videos ? 
  then [ eve101 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plpnqe9gflv2i5uan2wlyc-b9t2b-dqbrl ) is for you . 
  * maybe you like lists of tips and guides . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/1c211z/the_have_a_tip_leave_a_tip_eve_thread_round_v_the/ ) . 
  [ here 's another , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) written by me plug plug . 
  or maybe you want to talk to someone in game ? 
  there 's a help channel , which is pretty busy , but there 's others that are player run . 
  * deedeereddit is a help channel populated by dreddit , which is reddit 's first eve corporation . 
  they will know to provide bananas for scale , and will shower you with isk . 
  * brave dojo is the hangout for brave newbies , which is a large corporation , but is suffering from an influx of newbies at the moment , so probably dreddit is better at the moment . 
  * i could probably track down some more stuff for you - voice chat channels you could hang out in , etc. 
  ccp also released a news article , 
  whichever has the face you like the most . 
  seriously there 's less than an hour of skill training difference between the races . 
  he 's having a serious attempt , though . 
  check the assets menu tab , it should allow you to search . 
  bovril borers corporation seems hell bent on getting new players into mining ships , while still killing everyone who attacks them . 
  they 're in / r/bravenewbies . 
  i lost my first five tech 2 drones by having them out when downtime hit . 
  ccp reimbursed me for them . 
  shit , i really need to make an aussie newb friendly corp , this is getting out of hand . 
  do you have to pay in potatoes ? 
  fyi , agl gives you free stickers because it turns out that door to door salesmen are the main reason they lose market share . 
  probably better to have two separate characters for that . 
  looks more like ` rss * colonial * ruins ', 
  ] ( http://meme-lol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lol-meme-haha-2014-browsers.jpg ), 
  it 's faster to wash peoples cars for the rl money than to grind the isk needed in game . 
  you may find that you can buy a few plex per year , but do n't count on it every month . 
  / r/evenewbies, 
  grr posting, 
  jet cans last longer if you name them , but generally no longer than 2 hours . 
  try something like http://eveindustry.org/calc/ but yes , sometimes it 's better to sell your ore or minerals instead of building some things . 
  so , do you support civil unions having * all * the same rights as a married couple ? 
  ok , what about the word ` wedlock ' ? 
  can gay people have a ` wedding ' , even if you do n't agree that they should have a ` marriage ' per se ? 
  i 'm trying to understand where you draw the line , because it seems you 're okay with giving gay couples the rights and responsibilities , but not the name ? 
  if so , then which other words have you also reserved for man + woman pairing ? 
  / r/evetech will know . 
  it did get destroyed , but was written off as an acceptable loss . 
  perhaps next time , use a [ procurer instead ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-04-at-9-23-33-am.png ) . 
  it 's very tough for a mining barge . 
  are n't you the guy who wrote a link bot anyway ? 
  what do you want a new link for ? 
  disabling your warp drive is usually the first thing someone does when they want to kill you . 
  to avoid that , you 'd need 2 warp core stabilisers for every attacker , which cuts into the low slots you 'd be using for mining laser upgrades or a damage control . 
  generally , the only ships that fit warp core stabs are those that are fast enough to get away when chased ( like blockade runners ) , which a slow mining barge wo n't be . 
  it 's in beta testing . 
  hmm , buddy bot missed this . 
  pm sent , using same rules as buddy bot . 
   telecommunications analyst paul budde said while some cashed-up australians or businesses might be willing to pay thousands of dollars for high-speed fibre , the onus would largely be on local councils and business groups to be proactive in pooling resources to foot the bill . 
   `` that would be particularly very interesting for the hundred or so major towns in regional australia that might not be connected otherwise , '' mr budde said . 
  how sopranos of them . 
  `` nice broadband network you have there . 
  it would be a shame if you ... could n't connect to it . '', 
  maybe just normal banned comments ? 
  if you subscribe after using an extended trial , the person who sent the trial link gets a reward worth quite a few hundred million isk . 
  they then have the option of splitting it with their buddy . 
  no , just the plex .
