  i had that happen ( well , the car was stolen , then turned up a few months later ) . 
  basically , i bought it back from auction when it came up , because i knew its condition . 
  it was pretty cheap and i pocketed a couple thousand from the difference between my payout and the purchase price . 
  but then i spent it all fixing it because there was some hidden damage to the engine . 
  well . 
  but , if it 's just hail damage you should be fine to buy your own car back . 
  i ca n't find the [ _ new _ ] ( http://cdn1.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66657/1/6.png ) icons though - just the old ones . 
  clinton had the dot com boom to help him .

   recruiting you look at their kills that are provided by their api, 
  looking at the api of a new character does fuck-all . 
  that why newbies have such a hard time finding someone who will recruit them , and that 's why this change * will * happen . 
  really ? 
  they 're two for $ 5.50 at subway around here . 
  germany has a huge deposit , like 50c or so . 
  discarded cans get cleaned up pretty darn quickly . 
  could you belong to multiple corp lites ? 
  for instance , i 'd love to join the gang night corp lite , the fail heap corp lite , metrosexuals anonymous , etc without dropping my real corp. 
  a newbie in an ewar frigate can be useful in null sec within a week or two . 
  yes , that is correct . 
  does n't matter ; donuts acquired . 
  do n't they have reverse vending machines over there , so you deposit bottles and get cash ? 
  as a rule of thumb , the meta level indicates its origin ( one clue is the type of chevron in the top left corner of the item ), 
  meta 0 : tech 1 , manufactured . 
  meta 1-4 : loot drop, 
  meta 5 : tech 2 , manufactured, 
  meta 6-9 : faction , bought from loyalty store or random drop, 
  meta 10 + : officer , random drop . 
  see this page for an example :, 
  most skills are sold by npc corporations , e.g. 
  a few are only available from the loyalty stores , e.g. 
  some [ do n't have any way ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=25530 ) to be bought , and thus are only available as loot drops . 
  there is an eve sdk which comes in database form if you want to do that yourself ; i think there 's a few web apps out there ( like chruker 's or maybe lmeve ? ), 
  that link the sources as well . 
  cool . 
  i hope they 're called shell corporations , it 's a fitting name . 
  it 's important to note that the big companies already have claims to some really high quality ore . for instance , bhp has a hill made of mine tailings from the 70s and 80s that is still higher in ore content than many of the newer mines , fortescue included . 
  what that means is that the big miners can stay profitable for a lot longer , since they can cut their new stuff with old stuff and compete on quality . 
  i know of a corp that does wormhole diving from high sec . 
  yes , it was given to ccp punkturis . 
  there 's a picture of it on twitter . 
  so , always set collateral unless there 's something special ( i.e. 
  your corp jf guy does n't accept courier contracts with collateral because ` fuck you it 's my fucking jf on the line ' ), 
  add or remove psssh . 
  it would help , though , if you were managing a team of offshore developers, 
  so , maybe cash out some as soon as you get the pay increase , since you 're unlikely to get another rise in quick succession ? 
  japan has been in a deflationary quagmire for over a decade . 
  the tax is n't the sole cause . 
  mining drone yield is objectively miniscule , and the better your ship is at mining , the less difference they make . 
  on the other hand , combat drones are the only way a mining barge can kill an npc pirate ship , so they fulfill a necessary role . 
  procurer is about eight times more durable than other mining barges , which means that attackers will usually ignore you in favour of easier targets . 
  skiff is the same , but even tougher , although at a much higher price . 
  tech 2 mining lasers are a lot better , as well as being prerequisites for strip miners . 
  then take a look at some barges :, 
  * http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/, 
  my opinion is that the japanese government half-arsed the qe and now they do n't have much to show for it , and not many tools left in the toolbox to get out of the mess . 
  moon mining does n't take any special skills . 
  just find a moon , set up a tower , and start mining . 
  manufacturing is easy . 
  just aim for advanced mass production iv and add any further prerequisites based on what you want to make ( industry v is a common requirement ), 
  i had similar thoughts ; short on time , pondering an industry alt . 
  i 'm not sure how it happened , but somewhere along the way i realised i now have an industry * main * and a combat alt . 
  change the semicolon to a comma . 
  pretty much , unless you 're in a strategic cruiser or interceptor , which can warp through bubbles . 
  such are the perils of null sec .

  / / buy/max exists so that xpath is fine . 
  it might be to do with importxml instead . 
  maybe [ use a script ] ( http://eve-prosper.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/building-better-spreadsheets-crius.html ) in google docs instead of importxml ? 
  procurer ( with damage control until you get tech 2 mining upgrades to put there ) . 
  it 's the cheapest to fit and the most durable . 
  once you get some more isk , you may buy a retriever as well , since they are great for mining for 25 minutes without needing to deposit ore , but they 're a lot more fragile so i do n't recommend them for a first barge . 
  i would say that miners have the option of compressing and/or selling their ore instead of turning into minerals , so they can just get isk directly instead . 
  you can , however put money into her ( and/or your ) super , which obviously only works for retirement investment , but hey it does allow you to pay 15 % superannuation tax instead of your marginal rate . 
  have you worked out how much you want to put away ? 
  i mean , in your situation i 'd be hoping to put away a third of my income or more , but to each their own . 
  for reference , if you had a 100k home loan , you 'd be paying 600/month minimum but ideally repaying 1200 ( noel whittaker recommends 2x ratio ) . 
  so , if you plan to take on a 400k loan instead , best learn to do without 4800/month for a while and see how you feel about it . 
  why not both ? 
  having said that , maxing out your own super payments is a lot less hassle . 
  fw sees a fair bit of orbital action , since it 's easy lp eve-side . 
  planetary sov also sees action , since it gives an edge for your alliance . 
  high sec does n't have eve bombardments tho . 
  just ca n't be done by eve players , only by dust players . 
  maybe a margin loan for investing in the stock market then ? 
  i do n't know : /, 
  my hanging issues stopped after i disabled eve voice . 
  i once autopiloted a freighter through isanamo .
