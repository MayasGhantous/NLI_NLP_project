  jesus , just link to the first time you posted it . 
  they were about the size of bars of soap . 
  made a hell of a racket hitting the bottom of the ships . 
  i would not be surprised to learn they damaged the bottom of the cargo hold when they were loaded . 
  looks like you did n't trigger the bot . 
  do you still want a code ? 
  select all , right click , fit to ship . 
  waiting for still mostly harmless, 
  icelanders do n't eat anywhere near as much fish as they used to . 
  and they 'll be towing a trailer full of recyclable cans and bottles . 
  i 'll allow myself to get mildly hyped . 
  any news ? 
  both sides are legitimate pricks , yes . 
  let 's leave that aside and focus on getting the kids * out * . 
  [ / u/hurricangst explains how fifty shades of grey went from twilight fanfiction to movie deal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/twoxchromosomes/comments/2byz2l/many_women_do_not_agree_with_me_on_this_subject/cjaqvmi?context=5 ), 
  thet 's tirribul , muriel . 
  yogurt . 
  bring back / u/aradon, 
  i think you can get a 60-day new-account code ( it comes with the eve collector 's edition ) for cheaper than an accelerator . 
  heck , i saw people * give * them away - you might be able to ask on / r/eve if anyone has a spare . 
  i heard there was a special event this year at fan fest ... 
  if he leaves , it stops being the worst . 
  [ maybe gear as well ] ( http://vrfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/himlargear.jpg ) ... 
  i hope they remove strongboxes from the strongbox loot table . 
  it 's pretty shit using a key only to get 3 more strongboxes . 
  the advantage of prototype weapons over , say , advanced , is generally not worth it unless you 're running in a squad of your besties , or have a lot of isk . 
  caldari commando suits are really good snipers ( sniper rifles being one of the few weapons where having a mouse is actually useful ) . 
  they also work fairly well as assault suits in a pinch , if you 're short of sp . 
  nbsi makes life simpler : anyone who is n't explicitly your friend is implicitly your enemy and it 's your duty to shoot them . 
  nrds is the other 49 shades of grey : whenever a neutral enters your system or pops up on your overview , you 'll have to evaluate whether they 're a bystander or attempting to harm you . 
  on there other hand , nrds is a lot better if you * are * the bystander . 
  tldr joining a provibloc alliance would probably suit you a lot . 
  what is it you actually do ? 
  gal scouts are pretty nice , i run them myself , but sometimes you want something with a bit more tank , 
  i generally do n't run full proto unless i hit 500m , but to each their own . 
  although , i 'll often run prototype sniper rifles or swarms because they 're cheaper than other proto weapons . 
  if you want to do industrial stuff , then providence is one cyno from high sec , which makes it really convenient to bring in raw materials ( although it also makes it easier to restock markets directly from high sec , so there 's that ), 
  eiph has a beta version that has post-crius algorithms . 
  note , however , that part of using eiph is working out which items are likely to get bandwagoned , so you have to work out how much to build before the market floods . 
  i do n't see them mentioning me , since i block them . 
  it 's fairly crowded , yes . 
  as far as poorer goes , it probably is that too . 
  `` rich 50 is normal people 38 '' - 30 rock, 
  ca n't wait for fanfest  so excite, 
  as far away as possible . 
  are any of the original aa team helping out ? 
  make sure you settle in a suburb with real nbn ... 
  fashion , uh ... finds a way . 
  youth worldwide , not just asia . 
  that guy . 
  still , you 'd expect a brisbane sydney melbourne network . 
  the adelaide flight routes are n't in the top three in australia like the eastern seaboard routes are . 
  i think he 's banned from the subreddit for spamming links everywhere . 
  well , maybe you 're in luck and you will get the reward anyway . 
  i live down under . 
  we have our own version of florida man, 
  yeah , posting quiggin 's blog posts would spur discussion, 
  does that make you a hepster ? 
  plus a bunch of stabs . 
  user name checks out : op is from queensland . 
  someone took the wrong bus . 
  tldr shit got real then everyone blued each other the end . 
  try to [ ban me . 
  this is something like the third time , ever , i 've seen abetz attempt to to something in the workplace arena . 
  or , as i call it , [ abetz mk iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeit_macht_frei ) . 
  say what you like about his management style , but most of the best policy decisions of the gillard era were from committees started when rudd was in power . 
  someone called him a mewling quim . 
  people who do n't use the word ` cunt ' wo n't start fights . 
  they 'll just have you fired instead . 
  south australia was n't settled by convicts ; you mob do n't count . 
  there were fungus before , it 's just that nothing could break down cellulose for millions of years . 
  fungus just happened to be the first thing that worked out how . 
  like / r/marijuanaenthusiasts ? 
  industry , you say . 
  10 free keys mission is available all this weekend . 
  generally , production planets are power grid bound , so you almost always have space to fit a few factories in . 
  this reduces the volume of the final product a lot , which avoids customs taxes and general headaches when moving it . 
  after that , it 's whatever your spreadsheet tells you ; some p2s may not be worth making compared to selling the p1s , and similar for p3s or p4 . 
  generally , though , the lower the taxes you can find on the planet that makes p2 , p3 , or p4 , the more profit you 'll make . 
  many people have a planet or two in low-sec precisely for this task . 
  if it factors into how you make it , yes . 
  for instance , a p2 is either made from two p0 extractors with p1 factories , in which case you pay one p2 export tax , or by importing p1 and exporting p2 . 
  this means that one method pays 9 % tax , and the other pays 9 + 4.5 % tax but with a lot more output . 
  this gets worse as you go up tiers , since the fees can start to add up quickly . 
  fyi when i was doing pi , my tax rate was 0.1 % . 
  as you can imagine , i processed a lot of p3 on that planet . 
  make or choose ? 
  also , stockpile plex . 
  plus it can fit shield reps so it 's immune to hyper dunking . 
  what could possibly go wrong, 
  / r/new _ eden_link_bot, 
  perhaps you could ... 
  ask the leyland brothers . 
  yeah , but the companies who need it most balk at the bill , because they 're used to the cheap prices . 
  ` what do you mean our $ 50k software system will take $ 500k to fix ? 
  get out . ', 
  right . 
  so , given that your senior management have ordered you on have 75 % of your development staff offshore , do you hire a graduate from australia , or do you hire two allegedly competent devs overseas and save the funds for your expert staff onshore , who are the only ones who can do the hardest 5-10 % of the work ? 
  welcome to the world of most first line managers in the australian it industry . 
  also , the supply of good australian developers will be fine for a few more years , until the pinch of graduates actually starts to bite .
