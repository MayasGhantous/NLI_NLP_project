  perhaps you can learn something . 
  ^ ^ relevant username, 
  why ca n't you ? 
  the faction warfare fights sometimes escalate up to super caps ... 
  there 's a clause in the australian constitution that explicitly says `` nz can join too , if they want '', 
  it 's an early beta of modern democracy . 
  yes ( although once you choose facial bone structure , you ca n't change them ), 
  you do realise that is happening within 6 weeks right ? 
  ccp is also removing all meta-0 loot drops from rats , which will remove about 10 % of the mineral supply . 
  soon ( tm ) . 
  they 're only halfway through retexturing all the ships so they can add different schemes . 
  seriously ?

  oh , trust me , they are . 
  i think you can do a total resculpt , but it costs you $ 20 ( or two plex ), 
  while mudflation is a real thing , that 's not what 's happening now . 
  this is a true supply crunch ( plus inevitable speculation ), 
  those numbers are pretty low . 
  you ca n't even build two battleships with that much trit . 
  i suggest putting up buy orders would be a better idea . 
  do n't worry guys , i got this . 
  how easy is it to get started up ? 
  easy ? 
  or is there a learning curve ? 
  what kind of profession would be best for a beginner ? 
  mining , piracy , ect . ? 
  what 's the community like ? 
  luckily , you 'll find out who is supplying your buy orders and can contact them ~, 
  should have been titled `` csm 7 now officer-fit '', 
  i believe it 's a petition type , or somewhere deep in account management .

  1 . buy many < frigate of your choice  , join red vs blue . 
  get 10 kills per hour for weeks on end, 
  choose a faction/advanced frigate hull . 
  master it . 
  choose a battlecruiser hull . 
  master it . 
  choose a faction/advanced cruiser hull . 
  master it . 
  reassess your next goal . 
  is that the guy who made off with a goon erebus and sang `` i robbed a goon , and i liked it '' ? 
  think laterally . 
  stop looking for patterns . 
  start looking for how often things turn up in various places , and stop looking at the puzzle from the point of view of finding the ninth square that matches the others , and start thinking of it as calculating the missing ninth of a larger square . 
  phew . 
  i thought i was the only one who did that . 
  missile pod drones are go, 
  you can use eve voice from evegate . 
  allegedly .

  it 's the handling fees . 
  so to speak . 
  or for a more offence-biased ship , a shieldgank talos . 
  1 . you need meta 0 to make tech 2 versions, 
  meta 0 refines to a lot more minerals than meta 1-4 . 
  prices have already skyrocketed ... 
  passive recharge pve fits should fit core defence field purgers . 
  literally the setting of a horror film . 
  i got a bad feeling about this ... 
  the simplest way is to pay a miner as soon as you haul his full can away . 
   que, 
  i already linked it in this thread . 
  does n't everyone ? 
  your fit looks pretty decent . 
  fyi there 's only so far you can go in w-space with a drone fit , as higher-class sleepers really hate drones and will pop them without mercy . 
  you 'll probably need to seek advice about what ships to train to be useful in a c4 or higher . 
  ( assuming you do n't just go into a c5 and go straight to a moros or thanatos ), 
  premature exclamation : more common than you 'd think . 
  firstly , a correction : most people wo n't know what you are talking about when you mention a ` passive armor tank ' . 
  the commonly-used terms are :, 
  * active shield tank, 
  * active armor tank, 
  * passive shield tank ( using shield recharge ), 
  * armor buffer tank ( plates ), 
  * shield buffer tank ( shield extenders ), 
  buffer tanks differ from active and passive regen tanks in that they are not expected to regenerate in any meaningful amount . 
  they provide a time buffer for you to do your thing , after which you better have incoming reps or warp out . 
  in contrast , active tanks and shield regen tanks are designed to tank more or less indefinitely up to a certian damage threshold , but to fail once that threshold is met . 
  having said that , there 's a few things you should know about tanking . 
  active tanks are great for predictable , low damage like missions and very small gang fights . 
  buffer tanks are great when you have incoming reps , as well as when you expect to have more incoming damage than an active tank could handle . 
  buffer tanks are also easier to fit and have no capacitor cost , compared to active tanks . 
  passive shield tanks are like buffer fits plus regeneration , but they use up all your slots . 
  the last point is important . 
  a shield fit ( either active or buffer ) will use up all your mid slots , but leaves all the low slots free for damage modules or speed enhancing stuff . 
  that 's why shield fleets put out so much damage . 
  similarly , an armor fit will use up most of your low slots ( you can usually spare a slot or two for a damage mod , but also may need to use a cap booster for an active armor tank ) , but this leaves a lot of spare mid slots for electronic warfare , dual propulsion or whatever . 
  with a passive shield fit , you usually end up filling all your mid and low slots with tank modules , leaving you with a tanky ship that deals 40 % less damage than other ships . 
  perhaps that 's what you are aiming for ; perhaps you 'd be better off with a less-tanky ship that can pop enemy ships a bit faster . 
  as for which ships for which tank :, 
  ** amarr ** : armor tanked , except perhaps for the curse and harbinger . 
  ** caldari ** : shield fit except for ecm boats which are usually armor or honor tanked . 
  ** gallente ** : generally armor tanked but shield + gank fits are common, 
  ** minmatar ** : depends on how many slots each ship has . 
  t2 matari ships are more often shield tanked because they have no em resistance hole . 
  did someone say [ factory planets ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) ? 
  although i do my factories in lowsec now because i like tax evasion .
