  phew , lucky i did n't pay for the gold , then . 
  if it were me , i 'd probably try for at least 30 % foreign , because australians are chronically under represented in foreign market investment compared to other nationals . 
  and reinvestment plans are great and i really like them . 
  if you have friends , you can even use a black ops bridge to get covert ships straight into low sec from high sec . 
  it does require a bit of set up though . 
  er , since the change to allow unlimited research slots per station , blueprint copy sale prices have crashed . 
  perhaps try making copies in station and building up a client base before setting up a tower . 
  i think that 's just for the hosting and marketing . 
  payment processing fees are an extra 3 % or so . 
  not too badly , but it ruins your mouse accuracy . 
  alts start with starting skills just like a trial character . 
  unkess you buy more training queues , you can only have one character per account gaining skill points at the same time . 
  do n't those ships have a huge bonus to overheating ? 
  might be better to play to its strengths ( although armour tanks do n't really have something as good to overheat as an invulnerability field ), 
  turn off eve voice . 
  it increases stability a huge amount . 
  how does that work anyway ? 
  get an internship as a sewerage reviewer , put in the hard yards reviewing toilets , then finally make it as an ass reviewer ? 
  i was under the impression australian super was fairly decent . 
  a true bpfh . 
  that moment when / r/evememes, 
  * shoebox, 
  this is ... actually pretty good . 
  bring back belt mining . 
  anything the goonswarm economic cabal touches . 
  i do n't know . 
  ... where to begin . 
  but , those types of taxes are really hard to dodge , unlike income taxes . 
  it does n't matter whether the pallet of books comes from ashgrove or adelaide ; the distribution network already exists once it gets to the brisbane warehouse . 
  i guess the first question to ask is whether you want to keep it in australia or not . 
  a few differences though . 
  yes , it 's in a belt , but you get them via ratting rather than mining . 
  you need a hauler to grab it , which does n't reward specialisation in mining like a real faction/officer spawn rewards ratting skill points . 
  if anything , hauler spawns reward manufacturing characters rather than miners , because they will have buy orders up for the minerals . 
  heck , from one point of view , hauler spawns * compete with * miners , rather than complement them . 
  ` you would n't download a car ', 
  importing ? 
  stop the boats !, 
  oh , so it 's valuable because it 's huge isk per hour , while also being great to compress ? 
  it is something that would reduce overheads of applying the gst though , so its always on the table when gst reform is considered . 
  er , what 's wrong with one yield fit mack strolling through ? 
  the best thing about eve is that nobody ^ * is immune from the consequences of their dickheadishness . 
  ( for a carefully crafted value of ` nobody ' ), 
  also , there 's high-slot drone link augmentor modules that add 20-24km to control range . 
  it 's like a [ bofh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bastard_operator_from_hell ) except for programmers . 
  ` refuge ' anp is a storyline item and is difficult to acquire , but no worse than tech ii . 
  the faction anps are also as good as t2 but acquired via loyalty points instead . 
  generally , faction gear is either strictly better than tech 2 ( like imperial navy anp ) or just as good but easier to fit . 
  anps are an anomaly because they 're ridiculously easy to fit anyway , so there 's nowhere lower to go . 
  but a phobos is never just a phobos . 
  come to think of it , team fortress 2 did something like that , for players who did n't abuse a particular bug . 
  wait , so we already have the capability to do this . 
  just make some asteroids be ** made of compressed ore ** . 
  you 're kidding me . 
  i prefer something a bit more punchy . 
  something like ... 
   progress . 
   what is it ? 
   out here , progress is numbers . 
   head counts ,, 
   death tolls . 
   this is progress . 
   colonies burned ,, 
   ships destroyed ,, 
   people killed ,, 
   money earned . 
   it all comes at a price . 
   and if the price is right ,, 
   i 'll set the universe on fire . 
  if n +1 were mitigated , eve , especially large fleet fights would be a very different game . 
  not necessarily a * worse * game though . 
  pinged [ bgoat ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/bgoat ) from http://www.dustcharts.com . 
  hopefully he responds . 
  you mean , connected via contiguous high-sec to jita ? 
  op better be china , then . 
  or vacation in australia . 
  same thing . 
  op success . 
  the devblog has n't been released yet , but when it is , perhaps you could ask fozzie to let fighters follow * you * into warp , rather than follow targets around the system . 
  the main problem with assigned fighters is that the carrier is at zero danger by doing it ( the fighters/fb cost isk , sure , but they also put out a lot of dps per actual player ) . 
  even fighters following targets around the system is still no-risk dps , which means fozzie will probably remove it . 
  however , fighters following your carrier around as you warp is a much lesser problem . 
  it helps ratting carriers ( and we all want to see more ratting carriers do n't we ) , and maybe you lose fewer fighters if you need to warp out , but it 's a nice perk that might slip through . 
  i almost got killed by a [ cassowary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cassowary ) when i was a kid . 
  i was at the zoo . 
  apparently the metal plates designed to prevent their crest from breaking down the door to their enclosure were worn down and bent , so the next time they went in to feed it , the door did n't close properly , and it made a break for freedom . 
  and this is just a *** bird *** from australia . 
  they 'll still probably go haywire if you warp to a tower . 
  if we 're lucky , yes . 
  um , i think you can defensively plex systems back into allied control , but ca n't offensively plex on an ally 's behalf . 
  bob carr . 
  brown nosing bastard . 
  australians coined the term ` fuck off we 're full ' . 
  you 're not an island . 
  aussies lock up kids in detention centres without anyone caring . 
  it 's pretty clear there 's an undercurrent of bastardry simmering below the surface . 
  yeah , but you do n't have the entire coastline as your single border . 
  while i applaud your intentions , i 'd prefer a more comprehensive overhaul of intel gathering . 
  it 's the range bonus that makes rail platforms so good . 
  also , whoever gets your top vote gets a couple of bucks from the aec .
