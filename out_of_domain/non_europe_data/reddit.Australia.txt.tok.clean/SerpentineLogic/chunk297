  at the ` more pay than 75 % of the country line ' , you 're looking at $ 80k for individuals and $ 130k for a household .

  did n't we have this like [ 4 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/2zh9eg/patch_notes_patch_notes_for_scylla_ccp_falcon/ ) ? 
  did you * not know * how that corporation got its name ? 
   region-wide buy order for ** hype **, 
  since you feel so strongly about it , i 'll write a serious blog post or something , detailing my thoughts on this subject . 
  well , an obvious strategy would be to put the maximum amount into super each year from now on . 
  well , it * is * a tuesday . 
  they 're about due . 
  maybe make regular transfers then ? 
  dollar cost averaging works, 
  in that case , he 's more like the page down king . 
  yeah , if you 're not in those industries you 'll get smacked hard with fringe benefits tax . 
  when will people learn that the ccp art department * invented * `` soon '', 
  it 's quite unlikely to require a subscription fee . 
  at absolute worst , it would be an * optional * subscription like planetside etc. 
  you can set the * destination * , sure , but autopilot itself should only be used seldomly . 
  `` let 's twist again , like we did last summer '', 
  investment anything . 
  pretty sure you can negative gear shares as well . 
  eve wallet aware ? 
  a few items are time-boxed , most are n't . 
  it depends how fast you can make isk . 
  assuming you can pull in 10m isk/hour , that 's 80 hours . 
  so , that 's a gain of $ 0.20 per hour , and i would be disappointed if you considered that a good idea . 
  you can send eve isk to a player and their dust character will send dust isk to whomever you choose . 
  message me if you want details . 
  it 's small but it increases the longer you go without private cover . 
  barrels of fun ^ [ tm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodies_in_barrels_murders ), 
  this is me . 
  let me know what i can do to help . 
  yes , multiple characters are very common , and multiple accounts are also common . 
  an eve player who reaches 1 year playing time will have , on average , 2.1 accounts . 
  you can have alts on the same account . 
  this wo n't cost you any more money , and allows you to e.g. 
  have a market alt to buy stuff and create courier contracts so you do n't have to shlep over on your main , or to have an industrial alt manufacturing hundreds of items while your main is in a totally different region of space . 
  you can even activate dual character training to train skills at the same time . 
  however , the main drawback is that you can not be logged in with two characters on the same account at the same time . 
  so , many people make their alts on a second account . 
  that way , they can have both accounts logged in and helping each other , they 're paying twice as much but they 're getting the benefits of two skill queues so that 's fine . 
  the only problem is that you are paying for two sub , and if you decide to halt one subscription , you also lose access to that character . 
  it 's not a huge downside , but it 's worth remembering . 
  well if you are willing to forego the two weeks of trial , just start a new account using tour first accounts buddy invite key , and get a free plex . 
  as long as you run lower settings and are n't running on a mac laptop , you should be able to run two accounts on the same computer without major issues . 
  i heard q super was pretty good actually . 
  keyboard is fine , and eg tanks and light vehicles are great to drive . 
  mouse operation is emulated to be controller input so it does n't behave the way you expect from pc shooters . 
  it 's possible to play , but i suspect you 're better off with longer range weapons like sniper rifles and rail rifles , where the fine accuracy of mouse is better than the aim assist of controller . 
  or get a mouse controller emulator like the x3 or whatever it is called and get the best of both worlds . 
  turn on captions . 
  they 're not completely accurate but they help . 
  actually , the old testament had lots of strictures saying ` if you do x you are unclean , wash yourself or just avoid ' . 
  in an age without refrigeration , i can understand why they said shellfish are forbidden , various animals are forbidden etc. 
  i tell them what santa does , then say ` does that make sense to you ? ', 
  one day they 'll say no , and then realise that they should also apply that to other topics i ask them the same question about , like ads or religion or whatever . 
  if so , it 's a very chill cult . 
  fit transverse bulkheads rigs and a damage control, 
  100mn mwd , as detailed below, 
  fit a shield booster and hardeners so you 're resistant to being whittled down by the hyper dunking method, 
  do n't take it out when you 're under a wardec . 
  i assume you 're autz ? 
  how much are you expecting in sydney , vs how much in singapore ? 
  sometimes i get two yellow gates in the same system , so i shout `` jesus take the wheel '' and let autopilot work it out . 
  that 's a legitimate tactic though . 
  pretty sure that will happen no matter where those extra people come from . 
  at least immigrants are more likely to do actual work . 
  pretty sure the greens are the strongest against negative gearing amongst the majors . 
  they 're both there . 
  ca n't you see them ? 
  i can see how that could be a step down . 
  105 in sydney is quite middle of the road . 
  i suspect 110 in singapore is similarly ordinary . 
  put some in the euro market , some in the us market , some in the domestic market and some in whatever else you want . 
  i prefer the latvian remake , `` is so dominix '', 
  use desktop site . 
  foods cheap , housing is still exey . 
  surely it 's better to chat in local when you 're online ? 
  hit me up for details , we have a lot of people in that time zone , and if you prefer another alliance , i know a few others . 
  have you considered eve university ? 
  i mean , i can extend a corp invite but there 's a minimum level of competency needed . 
  tech 2 medium drones do something like 20 % more damage than tech 1 . 
  i love targeted stuff like this , especially since i suspect rattati is just using us as guinea pigs for amassing more data . 
  for pve ? 
  whichever one does the damage type you need to do . 
  for pvp ? 
  it depends . 
  the amarr and minstar ones are much faster , but the caldari and gallente ones hit harder . 
  faction drones tough as nails and roughly as good as t2 , but they 're pretty expensive . 
  most people use t2 . 
  http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/al3xand3r . 
  ok , so what do you want your corp to * do * ? 
  i do n't care whether your goal is to be the best mining corporation in isanamo , or to be the premier supplier of targeting range scripts in caldari space , or what -- as long as you have a goal to work towards . 
  as it turns out , ccp released new matchmaking code that puts players in two brackets . 
  the ` rock ' and ` suck ' brackets do n't usually get matched to the same games , so if by chance you get assigned to the ` rock ' bracket , you 'll soon get smacked back into the other bracket until you improve . 
  fair enough . 
  have you considered moving to a high sec pocket surrounded by low sec ? 
  more generally , events that would draw bad publicity are often covered up by the affected institution . 
  australia is sitting on literal * mountains * of uranium . 
  it just only allows three uranium mines to operate at a time for political reasons . 
  ps : if you 're going to down vote , it would be nice to mention why .
