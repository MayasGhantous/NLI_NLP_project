  perhaps train the connections skill , which will provide a bump in standings towards agents . 
  that should get you over the threshold . 
  i have a trade alt that sits in a station and buys stuff . 
  i also have an industry alt that happens to be able to fly a freighter , and now has almost-maxed trade skills ( do n't ask ), 
  one can dream . 
  i guess the obvious thing is to start in the places where people your age congregate , and work outward via networking with people you meet :,

  apparently i still have a ways to go , but i know which way i 'm heading : /, 
  yeah , if op wants a battle cruiser , the sleipnir has a massive em resistance . 
  i think it 'd go over * exactly the same as * death . 
  they might be giants has a series of children 's albums , btw . 
  they 're a solution in search of a problem . 
  if you have a target painter , you should consider t2 fury missiles . 
   fed, 
  well if there 's one thing . 
  brave is good at , it 's feeding . 
  also , eating uncooked or rare meat in a hot climate was likely to get you killed by food poisoning in ancient times . 
  iceland is a special place . 
  they have a very strong `` fuck you , i 'm a viking '' mentality , and are just about independent enough to follow through if pushed into isolation . 
  also they 're probably small enough that they know where the president of the bank lives , and whether he 's an arsehole that should be left to rot in his own mess . 
  lockefox used to hire manufacturers and inventors , but it was pretty ordinary wages , something like 50m/month . 
  why not just set up a few jumps from a trade hub and do it yourself ? 
  frankly unless you 're in the second-top or top bracket , it 's not really something to worry much about . 
  why not a few ? 
  considering how uncertain the economy is , probably a bit of us and european exposure would be good . 
  so , each time you reach i dunno 5k , buy a new type until you have all the types you want . 
  dm ; bdd, 
  bring back / u/aradon, 
  gim me a ballpark figure : is it over , or under 9000 ? 
  who did you get the invite from ? 
  start an austrian meet and see who turns up ? 
  tldr ; not true . 
  til mario is chinese . 
  tldr ; op is being a dickhead to a mod , mod dicks back harder , nuadi has the patience of a saint , bans all round . 
  looks like the bot did n't pick up your post . 
  if you still need a link , you can [ use mine ] ( https://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=d4513ea1-7716-470a-8c8f-a9eb0fa1cae8&amp;action=buddy ) and i 'll honour the normal buddy bot terms and conditions . 
  er , all travel agents , and most online sites can handle open-jaw trips , so going ams-bne , hiring a car , then flying mel-ams should be fine on all but the cheapest tiers of airfares . 
  expedia says austrian airlines will do an open jaw ams-bne/mel-ams flight for ~ 1880aud , with transit in vienna and 9hrs in bangkok en route . 
  finnair also does one with stops in helsinki and singapore , depending on the days i guess . 
  computer says [ no ] ( https://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-04-at-10-58-26-am.png ), 
  i went through echoice , since the mortgage choice guy seemed a bit pushy . 
  either way though , they 're all about * which * loan to get , not * whether * to buy a house . 
  the bot does not message you links , only via comments . 
  it explains why in the faq . 
  i get a lot of contracts delivered for 100k/jump , and i still get a lot of success with lower-collateral contracts at 50k/jump . 
  there 's not a huge lot of difference between a vanguard fund and the etf that it buys into . 
  etf is easier to buy large chunks on the market ; the fund is easier to make regular deposits into . 
  but , if you do n't like the australian market at the moment , then there 's funds that invest overseas ( vts etc ) that you may want to purchase first . 
  also , if they offer to haul stuff for you , always set a collateral equal to the value of the stuff in the courier contract , even if it costs extra . 
  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 give historical campaigns, 
  a local beekeeping club might be a good idea too - they often have a small library of books to lend to members , as well as advice of course . 
  separately , i believe . 
  as a man , it has never occurred to me to pay special attention in a car park or out alone jogging . 
  it 's just not in my experience . 
  i reckon your friend is the same . 
  shipping costs are way lower than you 'd think , so the bread does n't have to be much cheaper to be worth it . 
  but it does n't alter my behaviour , and if i am the recipient , nobody will * blame me * for it . 
  like i said , just walking around the place is something that is experienced differently by men and women . 
  does n't matter , most of the subscribers are bots . 
  or you start thinking you know better than doctors because you 're richer than them . 
  well , there is that play services [ issue ] ( https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/fix-cyanogenmod-11s-huge-battery-drain-affects-all-versions-google-play-services-battery-drain.285291/ ) , but at least there 's a temporary fix until the next patch . 
  i did n't know that t2 rigs even had blueprint originals . 
  yeah , but then you 're drinking * vb * . 
  apparently the international version of fosters is less terrible than the domestic brew . 
  no , there will be coexistence for a number of months , before ccp ` deals with ' old towers etc. 
  possibly by saying `` good news !, 
  we disassembled your old stuff and you are now the recipient of lots of p4 commodities to make new stuff with '', 
  those monsters . 
  i just * really * need some isk , 
  you 're allowed 10 % self-promotion according to reddit rules , but practically speaking , if it does n't get downvoted to oblivion , it 's fine . 
  does [ this ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimer-s-treatment-fully-restores-memory-function ) count as a good treatment ? 
  ( assuming it works on humans ), 
  it 's not the refrigeration that lowers the shelf life , it 's the washing that does . 
   if those sweeteners can bind to our receptors , they may also affect the gut microbiota that we depends on for homeostasis, 
  like the sweetener xylitol does for mouth bacteria ? 
  when did they change back from gnfnr ? 
  i just bought a thanatos . 
  i have n't undocked in months . 
  it 's $ 7 per month per dyno , so a typical setup with a web dyno and worker thread would be $ 14 per month . 
  cost to extract for the big two hovers around $ 20 . 
  also aws free tier only lasts twelve months . 
  setting a low bar , there . 
  do you still need a trial link ? 
  do you have a ccp name ? 
  i read that , and i find that unlikely to be accurate . 
  they were happily selling iron ore for $ 26/t in 2005 , and the capital works and automation they have conducted since then means that the economy of scale has worked in their favour . 
  adversity is recruiting, 
  hi , the bot sent me . 
  my link is in that post . 
  if you have any questions about the game , feel free to ask .

  i 'll take blatant manipulation for 400 , alex. 
  lucky that computers do n't give up as easily as you do . 
  we keep hassling bvoid to open-source eve droid since he 's too busy to develop it , but he 's ironically too busy to open-source it . 
  can you trade keys ? 
  this is not as stupid as it sounds . 
  inala is becoming gentrified , and benefits from the infrastructure provided by forest lake to the west .
