  we 're number one !, 
  step one is to build on what you already know . 
  you have pi alts , it 's time to start using some of them for processing rather than extraction . 
  what is profitable to process ? 
  best to make or find a spreadsheet and try your hand . 
  to make the most income you 'll need stockpiles of pi materials at reasonable prices . 
  this is where trade comes in . 
  after all , if you buy more than you need , you can sell the rest immediately on the market . 
  it may not be as profitable as processing , but it 's also not constrained by the number of pi alts you have . 
  after that , start looking at stuff that is made from p4 mats . 
  maybe you can manufacture them to soak up some excess pi from your processed stockpiles, 
  most t2 stuff takes a small amount of p2 or p3 mats , but i 'm talking about stuff that 's almost entirely made from pi , like control towers , deployable like mobile tractor units , that kind of thing . 
  so he concentrates on blueprints of the new stuff instead . 
  no biggie . 
  oh yeah , also , try not to do pi processing in highsec , the taxes will kill you . 
  set up or negotiate access to some < 1 % taxed barren planets one jump from highsec , preferably in a system with a station , then set up there . 
  high sec itself levies a separate tax that you can only get down to 5 % . or 7.5 % with skills . 
  that adds up if you do imports and exports . 
  evidently so . 
  we 'll soon find out . 
  can route industry jobs to and from them though . 
  it 's physically far , but logistically close because ipswich express trains stop there so there 's always trains arriving . 
  i guess it 's possible to make her a director of the business ... 
  all at once , or one blunt at a time ? 
  it might be secure most of the time , but they 'll have fun filled weekends . 
  well ubank is owned by nab . 
  i 'd laugh harder if i were n't also getting owned more often , and harder when i run solo . 
  well , this sub does n't get a lot of advertising ... 
  npsi, 
  download j eve assets ? 
  chopsticks sticking into an open station hangar container . 
  frankly for something as clear cut as this , the law would n't stop me at all . 
  also the thera corps . 
  they have exits everywhere . 
  six launcher fits often have capacitor issues , hence dead space and or under sized boosters . 
  in contrast , a five launcher tengu can permanently run a faction large shield booster . 
  i bet they name their swords , too . 
  the chick at the local service station reads university textbooks on night shift . 
  good job for students . 
  how do you make that anyway ? 
  sprinkle condoms on , as a topping ? 
  maybe try the drone ships , then . 
  if i recall , all the attack battle cruiser hulls came from that competition, 
  how , if they no longer submit australian tax returns ? 
  it 's a couple of gigs per hour . 
  one had a stable share of a stable market . 
  one has a precarious share of a changing market . 
  yeah , let the man 's doomsday recharge . 
  [ sauce ] ( https://plus.google.com/116689485158866735676/posts/a3ynb3qbzdb ), 
  most people only work 220 days per year . 
  base salary divided by 220 days divided by 8 hours . 
  dust with mouse is terrible . 
  if i could use a controller i would . 
  no , orbital ammo only fits in small turrets . 
  reading between the lines , it 's cancelled or you 'll never hear about it until dust actually dies . 
  you monster . 
  distinct lack of redheads . 
   the worst offender in my opinion is the wh40k universe , they 've built this big juggernaut of cultures and religions clashing but you never see or hear anything about the day to day lives of the civilian populations in any of the media associated with that series . 
  then you need to read the gaunt 's ghosts / double eagle series , the crossfire trilogy , and the eisenhorn series . 
  they have this axis thing going . 
  take a train trip maybe . 
   i mean to say the setting where you get around , and purposfully try to make degoritory jokes, 
  i call that the pub . 
  if i knew these things were in demand , i would n't have declined the last nine times i have been offered one . 
  controllers break , and , well , fuck spending $ 70 on a new controller for a single game that 's not actually worth spending $ 70 on . 
  or maybe use the power of the internet to buy it in usd like everyone else . 
   sorry , this item ca n't be shipped to your selected address . 
  i know . 
  let 's look at the changes . 
  * if your income is  250k you pay 30 % input tax into super , down from the previous limit of 300k . 
  that 's still better than 49 % tax that you 'd normally pay , and frankly if you 're consistently earning that much , you wo n't have problems funding your retirement . 
  * ~ ~ if you * are * retired and your super is paying out 75k + per year , you will now pay 15 % tax on the amount over 75k . 
  that 's a low tax rate with a high threshold - it only affects ` retired ' people who are funnelling money straight from their pay packets into super then out again . ~ ~, 
  edit : the west oz [ explains it better ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/27270571/labor-to-tax-super-paying-75-000-plus/ ), 
   under policy changes to be announced today by opposition leader bill shorten , superannuants would pay 15 per cent tax on earnings above $ 75,000 . 
   assuming an average rate of return of 5 per cent , this measure would affect only those who had more than $ 1.5 million in their superannuation accounts , or about 60,000 people . 
  in short , this wo n't affect the poorest ~ ~ 95 % ~ ~ ~ ~ < large number  ~ ~ [ 98 % of people ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/33ed36/rich_to_lose_tax_breaks_on_supersized_super_under/cqkbcnz ), 
  i blew all my free 5500 aur on skins ; that 's about as far as i went . 
  updated my comment . 
  i did n't do the numbers , but here they are ( source in my original comment ), 
  * about 60,000 people affected by the 15 % tax if your super fund makes more than $ 75k per year, 
  * about 110,000 people will get a haircut on super inputs due to earning between 250k and 300k, 
  there are [ approximately 11.5 million ] ( http://www.taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/paper.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/report/section_2-03.htm ) taxpayers in australia , so at the absolute most , there 's an impact of ** 1.1 % ** of the taxpayers, 
  there are [ approximately 3.1 million ] ( http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/4102.0main+features50march%202009 ) people who are retired in australia , so that 's at most ** 2 % ** of all retirees . 
  tldr ; way less than 5 %, 
  i think the two major parties have a * wildly * different track record of keeping election promises ... 
  something like this might work :, 
  assault c/1-series 8,040, 
  enhanced shield extender 2,610, 
  enhanced shield extender 2,610, 
  complex shield extender 4,275, 
  enhanced shield energizer 3,615, 
  enhanced reactive plates 2,415, 
  complex shield regulator 2,955, 
  duvolle tactical assault rifle 47,220, 
  submachine gun 675, 
  flux active scanner 975, 
  isk estimated cost : ~ 75,840, 
  but frankly , running a prototype weapon is generally not cost effective , and i do n't recommend it under most circumstances . 
  because it means that churches do n't have to go through the vaguely-stringent protocols that other charities need to go through , to weed out those trying to rort their non-profit status .
