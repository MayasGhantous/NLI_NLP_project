  the one that i grew up with was [ not pretty enough ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/not_pretty_enough ) . 
  i do . 
  wtb low-grade set . 
  it 's a [ fricking long way ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/moving-house/ ) , regardless . 
  norway saved up years of its oil profits o afford the standard of living they have . 
  costello created the future fund , which is a good start , but tbh we should be saving the mining tax money as well . 
  except for implants on podmails . 
  and that was quite recently . 
  do you ever get the urge to say ` you know what ? 
  let 's get some ethnic takeout tonight . 
  maybe a roast or something . ', 
  as an outsider to the us tertiary education system , i doubt that the salaries of low-level staff would be a factor in high tuition costs . 
  at the end of the day , a for-profit university will attempt to charge ` its true value ' aka ` what the market will bear ' . 
  costs will dictate a lower bound on the price , but the university is free to set their prices as they wish . 
  edit : [ supporting data ] ( http://www.google.com.au/?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=lumbley_pacheco_altbach_salary_report_2008 ) indicates that us salaries , while fairly high , are n't wildly out of touch with oecd countries - certainly not enough to explain the fact that you pay eight times as much for your university degrees as other developed nations .

  the tea party has many of the same goals ( although in some respects it is the [ other side of the coin ] ( http://www.stonekettle.com/2011/11/occupy-wall-street-lessons-from-tea.html ) ) but the fact that they are willing to work within the system has led to some measure of success in getting politicians elected that are supportive of their cause . 
  of course , you * could * argue that the system is too broke to fix , in which case sitting around protesting is fundamentally pointless . 
  of course , while you 'd take cap component bpcs into low-sec , taking the bpos is somewhat riskier . 
  * a medium t2 smartbomb ( or larger ) for clearing away stray drones . 
  * heavy neut ( and/or a medium neut ) for capping out tacklers, 
  * cruise missiles for ranged dps, 
  what ? 
  freighter skillbooks are only 65m or so . 
  if you ca n't afford that , then buying the freighter itself will be impossible . 
  seconded . 
  incursions are a good method to ease your way into a pvp mindset . 
  by doing incursions , you will, 
  * learn to work in a fleet, 
  * learn a few different roles that fleets use, 
  * learn to call targets , or at least learn to * follow * target calls, 
  * adjust your overview settings for greater efficiency, 
  * fly other fits than a l4 mission fit , which will get you killed in pvp . 
  * make some good isk, 
  * have fun, 
  * meet new people, 
  that will probably be fun for the next few months ; you might get to know a few regulars on the highsec incursion channels , maybe join their corp , and when you 're ready for the next challenge you 'll be better prepared for it . 
  ( after incursions get boring , i suggest joining red vs blue or ouch for some dedicated pvp action . 
  after all , why acquire isk if you do n't [ spend it well ?

  hello !, 
  first of all we want to thank you for all your feedback and interest in the [ player owned customs office ] ( http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;nbid=2899 ) !, 
  we have gone through the thread and thanks to the efforts of the community team as well as team pi members sitting up all night following the thread we believe we have a pretty good grasp on your feedback and your concerns ( let us know if we do n't ) . 
  one thing that really stood out was your concern for the transition period when all customs offices will be removed . 
  as a result , we have revised the deployment plan of the player customs office feature . 
  the new deployment plan :, 
  * the highsec customs offices are transferred to concord as previously planned, 
  * ownership of all lowsec , 0.0 and wormhole customs offices is transferred to npc corp `` interbus '', 
  * the interbus customs offices can be used for pi or shot down ( without standing or security penalty ), 
  * interbus customs offices will not be de-spawned , they will remain until destroyed by players, 
  * the interbus corporation will charge slightly more tax than concord and we will continue to monitor the tax rates for both concord and interbus, 
  so that is the deployment plan , now to some features we are doing directly based on your feedback . 
  the things we are doing :, 
  custom tax rates for different users !, 
  ( your corp , standing to your corp , your alliance ), 
  * [ simple ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/2832/3075/configure_advanced.png ), 
  * [ advanced ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/2832/3075/configure_simple.png ), 
  customs office ownership can be transferred to any player corporations ( let the bartering begin ! ), 
  * [ screenshot ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/2832/3075/transferownership.png ), 
  notification when attacked ( below 99 % shield ) and when put in reinforced, 
  * [ screenshot ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/2832/3075/notifications.png ), 
  player owned customs office generates kill mail !, 
  * [ screenshot ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/2832/3075/killmail.png ), 
  * changed customs office gantry size to 7600 m3, 
  * increased pco cargo capacity from 25000 to 35000 m3, 
  and remember , if you are worried about the customs office gantry blueprint being expensive on the market , you can prepare by getting the required loyalty points in advance . 
  * you need 3000 lp with a factional warfare militia and 10,000,000.00 isk, 
  * or , you need 6000 lp with concord and 20,000,000.00 isk, 
  we hope that you like the adjustments we are doing , we certainly value the feedback !, 
  the player owned customs office feature will launch with the winter expansion . 
  may your plans be dark and full of tax money !, 
  best regards, 
  ccp omen on behalf of team pi,

   dear spacefriends, 
   a year or so ago , i started a backlog of little things . 
  at its highest point , it had 300-400 small features ; some awesome , some of dubious quality . 
  with two little things releases at the start of the year and more coming this winter , we 've churned through the top layer of them . 
  they were prioritized in terms of quality , and we 're simply so deep into this list that i 'm running into more and more stories that just are n't worth it . 
   that tells me it 's time to throw the list out and start making a new one . 
  that 's what this thread is for . 
  hand me your grips and feature requests and i 'll prioritize them on my list . 
  go power of two , move existing character ( s ) onto it , profit ? 
  the [ nordic model ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ) suggests that a mix of both works a-ok . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'm a bit over looking at three dozen screenshots to work out what the new modules do and how to make them , so i compiled a list of all the new modules in one place . 
  note that this list does n't have minor changes to ammo sizes , or tweaks to ship speed etc. 
  if you 're interested in that , you can look at the [ full change set ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/sisi_changes.php ) . 
  * [ lots to do ] ( http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ ), 
  * other players to compete against or collaborate with, 
  * [ butterfly effect ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq2oxt7nrxo ),
