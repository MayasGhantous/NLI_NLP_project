  generally , tengu fleets see a lot of action in c3 ( solo ) and c4 ( remote rep ) sites . 
  once you get to c5 and c6 sites , you usually end up dropping turret ( i.e. 
  armor ) dreads into the site with rapier/loki/archon support , so it 's quite a different ballgame . 
  i played that game when i was five . 
  a video game has to be pretty bad for a five-year old to stop playing it . 
  i mean , this was the era when you 'd be playing this adventure game where the main character was a single pixel the size of your * fist * , so when i tell you that the graphics on the et game were terrible , i 'm speaking from experience . 
  were you aware that shield regeneration is not stacking penalized ? 
  however , the cap regen penalty * is * .

  that 's correct . 
  the [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ) has a handy button for it . 
   but on a recent mission , the enemies would only attack my friend . 
  the aggression mechanics in eve pve are primitive . 
  if you want the npc ships to attack you , shoot them first ( or get close enough ) and they will aggress you . 
  you may have to do this for each grouping or spawn of the mission . 
  good gallente ships ( there may be more , but these are the uncontroversial ones ), 
  standard, 
  * taranis ( interceptor ), 
  * catalyst ( gank boat ), 
  * vexor ( top three tech 1 cruiser ), 
  * myrmidon ( battlecruiser ), 
  * talos ( according to garmon ), 
  * dominix ( swiss army knife battleship ), 
  advanced, 
  * ishkur ( top 2 assault frigate ), 
  * enyo ( top 4 assault frigate ), 
  * arazu ( long point recon ), 
  the others ships may not be ` best in class ' but they 're generally not terrible either . 
  they just tend to be better in smaller fleets than in larger fleets , that 's all . 
  just that what reagan said and stood for and what people say he said and stood for are different things , and the divergence has increased a lot more once he became the paragon of republicanism in the eyes of certain factions . 
  most of the misattributions i have personally encountered have been to suit modern republican political goals , sure . 
  that does n't change the facts that there 's political mileage to be gained by making reagan a sock puppet ( or straw man ) and it 's better to view the man by his own words . 
  so , yay !, 
  we agree . 
  presumably he does plexes in lowsec and would appreciate the option to safe up when he sees probes on scan . 
  personally , if i were exploring in a cane , i 'd run with a small passive shield gank artycane like so :,

  you are surprised that there would be a market for telling people that their choice of < mmo/sport/beverage / lifestyle  is better than this other < mmo/sport/beverage / lifestyle  ?

  compared to a prototype cloak , the improved cloak has, 
  * -33 % sensor recalibration time after decloak, 
  * +25 % faster locking, 
  to be fair , dawkins did try and claim darwin was one too .

  bussing in school kids kids to sing his praises is a big clue . 
  the trite answer is :, 
  no , because people . 
  the east german stasi had thousands of informants controlled by thirty-five staff members . 
  that level of scalability could work in any size country . 
  just throw more bodies at the problem . 
  this is meant to be counteracted by the fact that there is an x-large shield booster but no equivalent for armor .
