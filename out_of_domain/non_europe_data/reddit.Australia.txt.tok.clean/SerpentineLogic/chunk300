  churches are welcome to start their own charities , but imo , they should not get a free pass `` because of god '' . 
  donations are income , and only a non profit status stops an organisation from being taxed on * net * profit due to excess income . 
  on the other hand , the business tax rate is capped at 30 % , while that of a human is progressively taxed all the way up to 47 % . 
   `` then jacob awoke from his sleep and said , `` surely the lord is in this place , and i did not know it . '' and he was afraid and said , `` how awesome is this place !, 
  this is none other than the house of god , and this is the gate of heaven . '' so early in the morning jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it . 
  he called the name of that place bethel , but the name of the city was luz at the first . 
  then jacob made a vow , saying , `` if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go , and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear , so that i come again to my father 's house in peace , then the lord shall be my god , and this stone , which i have set up for a pillar , shall be god 's house . 
  ** and of all that you give me i will give a full tenth to you .

  if you have a cargo scanner you can peek inside before you attempt to hack .

  just remember that a trade character is geographically-tied to the market or region you 're trading in , so it 's probably best to create a new character if you plan to go roaming around the cluster . 
  if you want to fly spaceships at the same time as trade , that character should also be on another account . 
   remember that the marginal cost of each extra ton of iron ore produced is low so even the high cost producers running at an overall loss will keep pumping the stuff out as much as they can to generate cash . 
  it depends on what infrastructure they already have in place . 
  rio and bhp have rail lines from mine ( s ) to port , so they can ship 100-car trains each hour for next to zero operating cost . 
  next is fmg etc who need to pay the big two to lease their rail lines but the marginal cost is still manageable . 
  then you have the opportunistic players like atlas , who were paying $ 5-6000 per truckload to get their ore to a port , which means, 
  a ) the marginal cost per tonne becomes significant, 
  b ) they 're capacity-constrained by personnel since it takes one driver all day to drop off a single truckload of ore and get back to refuel . 
  the small guys have a lot lower capital costs , but tactical solutions like that really do affect the marginal cost . 
  they stay up until filled or expire . 
  unless you 're particularly talented , then surely your trading character could do with more funds to trade with ? 
  you really are . 
  it 's not that ; there 's something screwy with stacking penalties and they 're in a code freeze until the next release . 
  tank players often benefit from some suit skills :,

  also , they have two equipment slots so that 's convenient for dropping uplinks .
