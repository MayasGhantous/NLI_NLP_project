  i 'd like to cut down some of the trees on my property for being too close , but i just ca n't afford the $ 25000 fines . 
  the trees are on my land , and the council denied permission to cut them because my land is under an epa . 
  attribute implants lead to risk averse behaviour . 
  if instead we had time limited skill training * boosters * that survived podding , that would solve the issue . 
  as long as they 're still player-manufactured and sold . 
  imo , you can still invest in your pod using hardwirings . 
  in fact , i 'd say the * worst * place to invest isk for attributes is your pod . 
  they use up slots and provide zero in-space benefits . 
  that is also a definite possibility , and would be something i would support . 
  nope sorry, 
  dust sp boosters can be extended for months at a time by applying them on top of the existing one . 
  i do n't see why the same concept could n't translate to eve as well . 
  especially since financing companies do n't pay the dealer 100 % of the purchase price , so you will have room for up to a 10 % discount . 
  i suggest getting a high interest savings account . 
  you can use it immediately while you decide , and can also use it afterwards while you save up the next lot of money . 
  so bad . 
  horribad . 
  red foo standing by . 
  brb lem me get my crystal ball, 
  so where do you think each international market is in that cycle ? 
  keep talking dirty to me, 
  [ literally six hours ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/34ba9e/eve_news_a_message_from_customer_support/ ), 
  i recommend buying etfs in chunks of $ 5k , just to minimise the transaction cost . 
  paying $ 50 to buy $ 1000 shares is a cost of 5 % , so you 've wiped out a year 's growth before you 've started . 
  way better than being offset to the left or right . 
  this is how i would do this . 
  download the eve client , make sure it 's patched up by starting the eve launcher etc. 
  get your credit card handy . 
  you * could * use it to buy a plex , but it 's cheaper if you buy a 1-3 month subscription on the eve web site . 
  use [ hours4plex ] ( https://community.eveonline.com/support/knowledge-base/article.aspx?articleid=793 ) on your * old * account . 
  this gives you 4 hours login time on your character . 
  login to the eve web site and get your [ buddy link ] ( https://secure.eveonline.com/buddy/ ) . 
  use your buddy link to create your * new * account . 
  create a character etc. 
  use credit card to subscribe on your new account . 
  login to the eve website with your * old * account , go to the buddy page , view past invites , redeem a plex . 
  login to eve on your old character , give all your money to your new character, 
  2 . redeem the plex ( you can do it from the character select screen , or in the new eden store menu item ) into your hangar, 
  create a contract to ` sell ' all your assets to your new character for 0 isk, 
  4 . congratulations , you have now moved all your assets to your new character , and have a free plex from subscribing your new account . 
  let the hours4plex expire and never look back . 
  put them in a container and leave them in a station somewhere.you never know when they might come in useful to a noob or as cover when you infiltrate an industrial corp. 
  i have played eve on a 32 ** kilobit ** connection ^ long ^ story and it 's still playable * on a mac * . 
  it 's way more likely to be your client being screwy than a systemic issue . 
  clear all the caches and if that does n't work , reinstall . 
  actually , it was an adsl connection with corrosion problems . 
  it was so bad i could n't even get dial tone . 
  i have contracted since 2011 . 
  basically , i put everything into my home loan so if need be i could withdraw chunks of it to live on for months on end . 
  i have been fortunate with getting contracts soon/immediately after the previous one ended . 
  as far as rates go , you really should be aiming for a rate that would net you ~ 40 % more gross income than a permie if you were employed for a full 12 months ( 230 days or so ) . 
  you need that margin to tide you over between gigs ( also your super has to come out of that ), 
  as far as investing goes , i suggest you invest into longer-term stuff like etfs while you have a paying gig , and ease off when you do n't . 
  in fact , what i used to do was at the start of a contract , i 'd even draw down some of my emergency fund to invest in a large chunk , planning to refill it during the term of the contract . 
  etc etc, 
  generally unless you go with more fully-fledged advisors like wilson htm , you 'll get fairly minimal advice and fairly low cost per trade so it 's much of a muchness . 
  are non disclosure agreements also very problematic ? 
  you two are in violent agreement \u263a, 
  10kw should last you overnight at normal household usage . 
  presumably the daytime power draw is covered by the solar and recharging the wall . 
  actually you 'd probably need a 10 kw solar installation to cover all day as well as recharge a power wall . 
  i ca n't say i 've had many enjoyable acquisition maps . 
  it 's a rare situation where a team has the organisational capacity to play tactically ; usually whoever is the strongest team will capture the point no matter where it is on the map . 
  it 's not as if it 's a long way to walk . 
  acquisition does lend itself to more vehicle use , since it 's a more mobile game mode . 
  that 's pretty good if you like using vehicles ; not so good if you like to kill vehicles because there 's more scouts , and the battle lines are more fluid so blueberries are even * less * capable of protecting you . 
  the correct term is ` reddit escorts ' . 
  the pertinent question is how much do you like all your eve accounts ? 
  is it worth the risk ? 
   it 's just amazing what they 've been able to do, 
  like what , exactly ? 
  tellingly , no eve valkyrie, 
  they even have a proof of concept using amazon to stream the character creator so you can create one without the eve client ( or the graphics resources needed ) . 
  all engineering degrees need 18 weeks of paid internship to be validated . 
  raise a support request . 
  ccp are the only group who can tell you for sure, 
  i see your doomsday is recharged , jester . 
  imo this could easily be fixed by the serpentis lp store offering a skin rootkit to allow a skin to be applied to any hull , not just the one it was originally set to . 
  not sure if serious , but just in case : 0 isk . 
  i think gevlon did some testing and discovered that wot actually gives hidden bonuses and penalties to players to keep their win/loss ratio within a certain band . 
  basically , they value player enjoyment over strict skill-based results and that 's their prerogative . 
  the idea is that you can convert spare isk into donations . 
  if you were thinking of paying rl money for the plex then i agree that it 's better to donate directly . 
  while you 're at it , [ plex4good is on ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/34is9z/dev_blog_plex_for_good_nepal_earthquake_relief/ ) , so donate all your internet spaceship money to nepal disaster relief before you leave . 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  yeah but worldnews is a cesspit . 
  i do n't know too much about it , but the web site implies you get full control over what your fund invests in . 
  bigger maps , but fewer control points would be ideal . 
  which area of null ? 
  obviously tech 2 lasers wo n't help much in serpentis space . 
  well there 's a lot of engineering , navigation and electronics skills that are useful for any ship , and you can easily spend a month just training all the useful skills to 3 without making a doctrine decision . 
  personally i 'd go test over brave , because they 're way more grateful to newbies because they do n't get as many per day . 
  new zealand does this . 
  basically when you leave the country , they ask you to nominate a guarantor for the outstanding amount . 
  he 's [ back at that university ] ( https://www.themittani.com/news/new-edens-economist-leaves-ccp ) as the rector ( or is that #rektor ? 
  eve now has a non-trivial [ cost of good sold ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cost_of_goods_sold ) , which jester noted has been [ historically miniscule ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/09/cogs.html ) . 
  paging / u/ccp _ quant, 
  i 'm pretty decent flying a dropship with mkb ( although only fly disposable militia because wallet ) . 
  the trick is to swap to first person view . 
  however , it 's strictly impossible to aim an ads turret because you ca n't control dropship third-person view with mkb .
