  why not just farm some lp and buy an apex suit or two ? 
  manufacturing costs used to be something like 433 isk/hour , which was basically a rounding error for anything . 
  now , since the costs are a percentage of market price/input materials/i forget , they materially affect margins . 
  fair enough . 
  really , none of them takes your fancy ? 
  you can buy them with aurum if you prefer . 
  it 's probably cheaper than buying a bunch of blueprints . 
  note that apex suits not only have filled slots , they have lots of slots as befits a prototype suit ... 
  you might want to try / r/ausfinance instead . 
  look at your expenses and see if there 's something you can cut without adversely affecting your life . 
  for me , it was buying lunch , yours could be anything . 
  you have an emergency fund in your saver account . 
  that 's good . 
  now , work out what size it should be , e.g. 
  3 months living expenses , 6 months , etc. 
  anything in your emergency fund above that amount should be invested . 
  where to invest ? 
  there 's lots of options ; i happen to like index funds as the mainstay of an investment strategy , especially for young people . 
  every time you get 5000 dollars extra in your saver account , go invest some more . 
  rorqual skin is ultra cheap , no big surprise, 
  each university may call it different names . 
  for instance , some universities have ' [ co-op ] ( https://www.cqu.edu.au/courses-and-programs/study-areas/engineering-and-built-environment/undergraduate/bachelor-of-engineering-co-op-and-diploma-of-professional-practice-engineering2 ) ' [ programs ] ( https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/programs-courses/undergraduate/bachelor-commerce-coop ) with blended work placement and coursework , but it 's by no means a universal term . 
  plus one point into lav or dropships , because walking is for plebians . 
   i can still taste the viscera ... shudders, 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're not supposed to put it in your mouth . 
  amusingly , the british navy later switched to a cheaper type of lime that was not a good source of vitamin c. 
  by that time , steam ships were a thing , so it was n't such a big issue . 
  a while later arctic explorers discovered they were getting scurvy . 
  the limes no longer helped , and medical science floundered for a number of years trying to find out what actually cures it . 
  ( fresh meat has vitamin c , but explorers did n't have access to that , except for seals , so some of them got scurvy and some did n't ), 
  eventually someone realised that the only two animals that do n't produce their own vitamin c are guinea pigs and humans , so all their previous experiments were invalid , and they rediscovered vitamin c 's role in the prevention of scurvy . 
  aw shucks . 
  good question . 
  due to the nature of standings gains being percentage-based , it probably wo n't matter since you wo n't hit one of the derived standings caps ( +5 for friendly empires , -2 for hostile ones ) . 
  and tech 2 ammo . 
  british sailors got a ration of rum every day because if they * did n't * get it , they 'd mutiny . 
  remember that a lot of them were pressed into service so they were n't particularly happy about being there in the first place . 
  neut drones do n't have stacking penalties . 
  * cough * anzac day * cough *, 
  remember that only affects different psn accounts than your main . 
  passive shield tank instead of active tank . 
  basically , increase your shield regeneration to the point that it can tank damage . 
  note : this will probably take almost all your mids , lows * and * rig slots to achieve . 
  fit a capacitor booster . 
  fill your cargo hold full of cap booster charges and it will inject cap at a fixed rate . 
  note that this tends to be used more often for armour tanks due to it being a mid slot . 
  bring friends , and/or fit for travel until you get your ship into the c3, 
  [ for the newbros who do n't get it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4kt2vw2xnm ), 
  imo , this is a great use of 3d printing technology . 
  one size definitely does not fit all when it comes to stuff that goes into your body . 
  i had n't noticed . 
  whatever the fuck he wants ? 
  because after you 've been to the gym , you 're quite thor .

  i did this . 
  it was surprisingly easy . 
  * caracal redesign, 
  * shader magic, 
  * overview and brackets icons [ i ca n't even ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/ui-modernization-icon-strategy/ ), 
  they 're just trying to trick me into logging in . 
  i 'm not falling for that . 
  being deceptive defeats the purpose . 
  they * want * it to be well-publicised , because it makes the kills they make just that extra bit sweeter . 
  until time zones happen, 
  ccp mankiller should be worried , then . 
  well you can probably do something quite sketchy by farming loyalty points if you have an alt in opposing militias , but i would not recommend that . 
  poe being poe . 
  there are enough ships to do yearly series . 
  keeps things fresh . 
  well , there 's a lot of money on the table that vive can pick up if they release before christmas ... 
  paging / u/bvoid, 
  droid [ uses eufe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/2uvj99/eve_droid_great_android_eft_needs_help_with/cocg7um ) so any other android app is free to integrate it . 
  as far as alternatives to droid go , there 's evanova which has lots of features but could do with a ui revamp , and there 's [ unicorn ] ( https://github.com/ccpgames/unicorn ) which currently has very little done . 
  comparing dates via string does n't cover it though , unless they 're converted to the same tz . 
  closer to 100 hours , then . 
  personally , when i started i ponied up for a 6-month subscription and managed to plex one extra month during that time because , well , i was spending it on actually enjoying eve . 
  generally , anyone who reaches 6 months playing time will work out whether they want to give away all their isk and unsubscribe forever , or whether they think eve is a game worth playing and will never * permanently * unsubscribe . 
  if you get to 6 months and think `` yeah this game is for me '' then i suggest going for a 12-month subscription to take the pressure off , then see how long you can make that last by plexing . 
  the eve collector 's edition has the recording . 
  best merger ever . 
  contribute to unicorn then, 
  and rocket salad . 
  just ate a whole bowl of it . 
  calories consumed : basically a rounding error . 
  * 1 clove garlic, 
  can low-sodium chick peas , drained, 
  * 1/2 cup greek yogurt, 
  * 1 tbsp . 
  water, 
  * 1/2 tsp . 
  salt, 
  1 tsp . 
  lemon juice, 
  instructions : blend everything together . 
  calories : basically whatever 's on the labels of the yogurt and chick peas . 
  * 1 tub greek yogurt, 
  * dukkah ( pepper , cashew crumbs , sesame seeds , sumac , just buy it somewhere ), 
  mix in a tablespoon or two into the yogurt , done . 
  you can also do this with other spice blends to make babaganoush dip , italian herbs dip , curry dip etc.
