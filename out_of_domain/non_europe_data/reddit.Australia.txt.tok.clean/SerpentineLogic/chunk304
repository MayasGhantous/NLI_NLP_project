  to elaborate :, 
  1 . buy a tech 1 drone blueprint . 
  small ones are cheap , larger ones are still affordable, 
  make ten 20-run copies using a research slot, 
  3 . optionally , research the blueprint original a bit, 
  start building tech 1 drones from the original, 
  3 . buy a few hundred data cores of whatever type are needed to invent, 
  submit ten invention jobs , each for 20 runs, 
  5 . you now have about 95 ten-run blueprint copies of the t2 drone, 
  6 . start building drones . 
  i hope you like logging in every 4 hours . 
  true , but you still have to build 950 drones to use up all the blueprint copies , so you may as well research them at least a bit . 
  nobody knows . 
  there is a small dust514 developer team that still releases updates , which goes against what was announced at fanfest 2014 . 
  whether that means that dust is benefitting from legion development time that gets back ported to ps3 , or whether legion got canned and all the devs moved back to dust is unknown . 
  manufacturing hobgoblin i is +2.7 k isk/hour , even buying minerals from sell orders in jita and building in station . 
  no blue intel . 
  i would n't put t2 rigs on any t1 ship at your level of experience . 
  lots of australians retire to bali . 
  it 's a thing , but not necessarily useful at your stage in life . 
  perhaps there 's one nearer you . 
  how does someone determine a good split between domestic and the various international markets ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm way over weighted to the domestic market , but i do n't even have a rule of thumb about what ratio to rebalance to . 
  step 1 : join macquarie . 
  do you know its price to earnings ratio ? 
  that 's a good data point to have , especially when you can compare it to other companies you know of . 
  nice 3/5th reference . 
  for example , if you turn up with undeclared fruit , it may have pests in it , which could ( [ and have ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-22/panama-disease-quarantined-farmer-approved-to-restart-operations/6413412 ) ) wipe out entire industries . 
  quarantine : super serious stuff . 
  it 's a job that suits certain types of people ; the ` the law is the law ' type who see things in black and white . 
  yeah , it gives me the shits . 
  serious question : what stops you from moving for the job , assuming you get accepted ? 
  that 's a big component . 
  yeah , transporting fruit over state lines is also not okay . 
  there is . 
  logibro worked it out before he joined ccp , but he wo n't tell . 
  we should riot .

  yes , but why * 514 * ? 
  the solution is to make more icons so they 're no longer out of place, 
  hershey developed a method to make chocolate from cheaper ( i.e. 
  less fresh ) milk . 
  it 's a trade secret , but apparently one of the side effects is that the chocolate is laced with [ butyric acid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/butyric_acid ) . 
  wikipedia says :, 
   butyric acid is present in , and is the main distinctive smell of , human vomit . 
  please add for vehicles too . 
  but is it worth getting out of bank stocks if they 're already preparing for it ? 
  since , that implies they 'll be in better shape than the rest of the economy ...

  minerals compress pretty well . 
  i understand ice compression is woeful though . 
  scanning skills , because w-space . 
  cloaking , because orcas make good boltholes in extremis .

   where would i be able to find legitimate reading about antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy/sociopathy ?

  buying any stock attracts broker fees , which is why most people buy in minimum chunks of about $ 5000 so fees drop to about 1 % of the total ( assuming $ 50 fee ) . 
  so , aim to save that chunk up first . 
  `` no blue intel in this channel '', 
  i did a half-dozen trials before it took . 
  i autopilot all the time on an alt . 
  then again , that alt is just a killright-farmer , so your point stands . 
  safer ? 
  yes, 
  better ? 
  many corporations beg to differ .

  i was looking at australiansuper , but i 'm not sure now that they increased their management fees . 
  btw 53k is a lot of money to keep as cash . 
  thought of investing some of it elsewhere ?

  not to be a downer , but it 's a very good idea to read up on financial stuff * before * seeing a financial advisor . 
  it has taken me many years to realise that both i and every advisor i have been advised by are * terrible * at picking stocks , and that i should just stop pretending to be an analyst and invest in funds instead . 
  i did n't know that at the time , and sadly it cost me a small-medium size car :(,

  you can still get to the career agent systems if you fly there . 
   it is quite easy to have a friend or family member bid on your behalf at auction , and the safest way to do this is by way of a limited power of attorney . 
  a limited power of attorney allows the grantor ( the person who grants the power to the attorney ) to grant the attorney sufficient authority to purchase a specific property for a pre-determined price . 
  of course , anyone considering having another party representing them in the purchase of real estate should obtain legal advice from a qualified legal practitioner first . 
  the person to whom the power is being granted should also obtain legal advice . 
  so , maybe get a second opinion at / r/auslaw then lawyer up .
