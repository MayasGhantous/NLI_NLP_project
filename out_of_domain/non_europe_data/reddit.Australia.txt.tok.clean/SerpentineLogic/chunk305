  i 'm pretty sure ` under the bed ' was the go-to hiding place . 
  i have some spare if you 're serious . 
  yes , because we all love to read about eve players absconding with loot . 
  money goes * into * eve . 
  if money comes out , the game will rapidly degenerate into craigslist scams . 
  how to deal with people who take out a loan then unsub, 
  eve is a great virtual world for virtual finance , but some of the problems raised in this thread can only be solved by the kind of regulation by ccp that is antithetical to the spirit of the game . 
  this breaks the eve . 
   right now , the criteria for sociopathy in the dsm are pretty identical to formulations of psychopathy that you would find in other theoretical orientations .

  woo , you 're posting with flair !,

  for me , the biggest overhead is the effort involved . 
  my oncologist recommends i do n't . 
  but mse+mapc only uses one mid slot , unlike sse+sse . 
  i can do you a dirty look and a coke zero . 
  for $ 20 , i expect a bit more than a skin though . 
  * particle effects, 
  * different engine trail colours ( [ jetsons trails !, 
  ] ( https://wiestworld.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/jetsons.jpg ) ), 
  * different cyno/bridge effects, 
  * different warp tunnel animations, 
  in the case where you even fit a mse ( sub-cruiser roles ) , mid slots are at a premium so it 's a rare case when to go web/mse/mapc is worse than sse/sse/damage mod, 
  there are fixed rate home loans , but only for a certain period of time . 
  plus , it 's usually a higher rate than the variable rate . 
  with regards to a deposit , do your sums . 
  i know a few people who worked out that if they got 10.5 % deposit , it saved them a bucket load of money compared to 9.5 % . 
  i would emphasise a small shield booster over dual sse for pve . 
  you can rebalance when you add , it does n't have to involve selling off . 
  dust is built on unreal 3 engine + some extensions . 
  unreal is fairly easy to port to pc . 
  valkyrie is built on unreal 4 , btw . 
  on the other hand , every minute i spend playing dust is a minute that i 'm not undocked in eve ( or doing something like afk procurer mining or otherwise antisocial ), 
  meh , it was a hundred bucks for me , since i got a ps3 second hand . 
  and tbh that 's how much games * cost * in australia , so why not . 
  350/month from 85k outlay is 5 % . 
  not awesome , but acceptable . 
  if they are n't members of the particular union that 's striking , then it does n't matter . 
  and if they * are * members of the union , then they need to work out whether the union is worth following ( in which case they should strike ) or not , in which case they should leave the union , should n't they ? 
  the flip side is that others are obviously not ` obtaining enjoyment ' to the point where they want to strike , so striking in solidarity is a way to address the power imbalance between a bunch of cleaners vs a business owner . 
  i realise unions are n't really a well-regarded thing in the usa or on reddit , but they can provide legitimate value to the least powerful class of workers in a society . 
  under normal circumstances this is ` maybe ' , but considering that she may get early access to that super due to her situation , i 'll upgrade to ` probably ' , assuming she qualifies . 
  probably best to check whether your super fund is any good , first . 
  personally , if it will take 8 months to pay down your personal debt , it might be better to concentrate on that for now . 
  deferring that until debts are paid off is prudent . 
  if you were sitting around with $ 20k in the bank wondering what to do with it , then sure , put a chunk into super for the tax breaks then work on an investment strategy for the money outside , but if you 're in the hole , best to fix that first . 
  leveraged investment magnifies gains ( and losses ) for a given amount of capital . 
  if you have 1000 shares in a fund worth $ 100 and it goes up to $ 110 , you now have $ 110k . 
  yay . 
  if you used the $ 100k as collateral for a margin loan to buy * another * 1000 shares of that fund , and it costs you $ 7k in interest charges , you 'd have 220k-100k-7k = $ 113k , and the $ 7k is tax-deductible to boot . 
  nice . 
  however , if that fund went down to $ 90 , your sums are now looking like 180k-100k-7k = 73k , which is pretty shit . 
  if the fund tanked to $ 70 , you 're looking at a 100k investment evaporating into $ 33k and your bank ringing you to give them more money to cover their margin call ( since the 100k of debt is only backed by $ 140k of assets , which is over their limit for that particular fund ) . 
  so then you have to sell some shares at $ 70 just to stay solvent , which locks in your 30 % loss . 
  even if they bounce back a month later , you still wore the margin call . 
  there are other ways of leveraging , but all of them share similar concepts of increased risk for increased gain . 
  it can make you a lot of money , just do n't over-leverage . 
  til that jungle creeps spawn at 0:30 . 
  i 've been sitting around waiting until 1:00 + to stack or pull . 
  i am not a smart man . 
  a bit dated , but still decent :, 
  most builds run micro-jump drives now , fyi . 
  i have bridged haulers and stealth bombers from high-sec into syndicate . 
  it 's quite convenient . 
   it 's not impossible to conceive building your own fleet out of scrap plastics . 
  especially if you have ten thousand plastics factories , like , i dunno , china ? 
  $ 52k aud is graduate-level pay . 
  here 's hoping that improves . 
   this overhaul of every hull is oeuvre hell,

  eep , still $ 39k to reach the ` logibro shaves ' milestone . 
  it 's just a twist on ` gday you old bastard ' and similar sayings . 
  to australia , the entire usa is `` north '' . 
  so 's mexico , panama and half of south america .

  that guy from the mentalist : australian, 
  basically , any aussie who wants to act in hollywood knows how to speak american . 
  well you might get to know them , then find out they 're utter * pillocks * . 
  so the solution is to buy two power walls . 
  i hope agl prices their unit appropriately . 
  any website on this page is legit :, 
  it 's the other way around in australia . 
  i sell pi command centres in high sec systems with lots of customs offices but no nearby npc sellers .
