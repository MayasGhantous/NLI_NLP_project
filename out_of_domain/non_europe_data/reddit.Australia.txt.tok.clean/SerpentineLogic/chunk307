  then outsource to the old couple at the end of the street . 
  probably because house lots are now so tiny you ca n't fit a chicken coop . 
   also , what effect would this have on minor parties and independents ? 
  all parties already get something like $ 2.40 for each primary vote they get , as long as they get at least 1 % or something . 
  this just means they get a lot more money per vote , but ca n't accept donations any more . 
  i 've heard good things about metricon , but i do n't have first-hand experience , sorry . 
  do tell . 
  dust 514 does this . 
  it makes a lot of sense . 
  however , to do this in eve , attributes need to die first . 
  not that i 'm upset about this . 
  i would be a bit irritated if attribute * implants * disappeared though . 
  i hope your friend has some luck with his petition . 
  pretty sure normal mirrors are n't below ambient temperature . 
  i really wish i could have an echidna as a pet . 
  i 'd consider this if i could get nbn to work remotely . 
  can you still rat with them ? 
  even if only with a thanatos ? 
  there was a time when i would have taken up that subscription offer . 
  that ship has sailed . 
  one of the major issues is that it 's not on ps4 * or * pc . 
  so , i 'm not holding my breath . 
  if it were a legitimate competitor to planetside , sure . 
  i 'm sold . 
  50 % in bonds sounds incredibly risk averse . 
  are you prepping for retirement this year ? 
  you do n't ; just use them until they run out , like all crystals . 
  edit : not all crystals get damaged by use , but those that do get damaged can not be repaired . 
  if it 's a shit car , comprehensive may not be worth it ( it certainly was n't for my first car , it was really expensive ) . 
  third party property , fire and theft is the cover i chose . 
  the coverage can be summarised by `` we wo n't fix your car unless it 's someone else 's fault '' , which i could live with . 
  crucible or something . 
  maybe inferno . 
  you need to see a tax specialist , pronto . 
  this is not something you can crowdsource an opinion for . 
  more to the point , if the tax specialist says `` oh , do this and you 'll be fine '' , and you do that and the ato audits you , you 'll have proof that you were advised to do it that way . 
  proof in writing : super important stuff . 
  if you have assets there , you can open up the assets menu icon ( looks like a secure safe ) , find the system , right click , set destination , then the autopilot will know where you want to go . 
  undock and press the bit a to the left of your circular hit point/capacitor readout , and it will get you to your destination . 
  it 's not the ideal way to get around , but it 's the easiest to explain how . 
  well done . 
  in essence , insurance is choosing a 100 % guaranteed expense ( paying insurance ) to avoid a small chance of losing a large amount . 
  insurance companies are useful because , while you might be up shit creek if your house burned down , an insurance company can weather the cost to rebuild because there 's 999 other houses paying them money for every one that actually makes a claim . 
  they spread the risk , and make a profit from it . 
  insurance companies also re-insure , in case there 's a situation even they ca n't handle . 
  for instance , suncorp has a reinsurance policy so that if there 's a massive flood or hailstorm or whatever , the most it has to pay out is $ 250m - everything above that is borne by the reinsurer . 
  sure , it costs suncorp money , but it also means they wo n't go under if there 's a hailstorm , a cyclone and a flood all in the same year . 
  nah , the crius changes really nerfed them hard . 
  i do n't think you realise just how easy it is to scale up production using invention compared to tech 2 blueprints . 
  i have my eye on a few new industry super plans that are index based . 
  look around and see what you think . 
  til javascript is the same as c++ because qtscript is the same as qt . 
  also cars are the same as carpet . 
  i was expecting it to only choke birds and fish that were threatening to make their way onto australian soil . 
  the `` go back to where you came from '' fish , as it were . 
  well , pakistan is a thing , so maybe it was a chance worth taking . 
  `` australia . 
  love it , or spawn eggs '', 
  me too . 
  btw you have a lovely house . 
  they 're not even bitcoins , they 're some kind of shady knockoff that nobody actually wants . 
  aka the [ linux sucks ] ( http://bash.org/?152037 ) approach . 
  so you 're saying there needs to be tutorial missions linked to each of the newbie opportunities ? 
  i can get behind that . 
  i 'm dying of not surprise . 
  \\* cough \\* monocle \\* cough \\*, 
  netflix made a [ bigger impact ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/these-graphs-show-the-impact-netflix-is-having-on-the-australian-internet-20150402-1mdc1i.html ) in australia . 
  the day it turned on , backhaul links to isps saturated across the country due to a sudden , sustained doubling of bandwidth demand . 
  nonono they 're agile ^ tm . 
  that means they skip the design phase . 
  [ old , still relevant ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/ ), 
  it 's not done via spelling mistakes ; it 's done by replacing words with their synonyms . 
  it 's relatively common for politically-sensitive documents and other places that are dead serious about security , like [ eve online players ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?16311-taking-the-meta-seriously-%28part-deux%29 ) . 
  do it by increasing cost ? 
  my irc friends switched to slack . 
  can self managed super funds even borrow ? 
  which is just nab ... 
  i saw that cua loan as well . 
  looks interesting . 
  if ccp had n't dropped the ball , i could have recommended dust 514 . 
  sigh . 
  i do n't think it would be much fun after you experience it once . 
  hell , we ca n't even download the client properly unless we turn off os x gatekeeper . 
  well a tech 3 subsystem might be all that 's needed . 
  ck + bottle is surprisingly good . 
  check contracts . 
  no , it 's an inferno thing . 
  mythbusters says : plausible, 
  a histamine-2 blocker like zantac will sort that out , although you 'll have to take them each time you go drinking . 
  they also love juice . 
  like [ niagara falls ] ( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/12/20/813517/-peter-watts-at-us-border ) . 
  the price in 2005 was $ 28.11 , or about $ 34 adjusted for inflation . 
  last i checked , the spot price was about $ 50 so the big miners should still be sitting pretty on their existing deposits . 
  i sort on symbol so that waypoint gates are always at the top :(, 
  ca n't think of any . 
  so , rather than perma kiting , just play range attrition and whittle them down ? 
  you 'll never believe what happens next !, 
  bankers hate him !, 
  but seriously , it 's a good article . 
  it 's also good to calibrate .
