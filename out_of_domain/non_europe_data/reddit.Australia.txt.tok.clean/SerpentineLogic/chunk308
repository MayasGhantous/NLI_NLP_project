  for instance , you might say `` ok i put away this amount every week , what does that * actually mean * for my retirement age ? '', 
  australian here . 
  are n't all games [ $ 100 already ? 
  it 's not helped by you calling him the messiah , m8e, 
  it probably has to be , if it 's a low slot and passive . 
  * tracking computers : mid slot , active mod , damn good, 
  * tracking enhancers : low slot , passive mod , not as good, 
  similarly with omnidirectional tracking links , sebos etc. 
  house of cards . 
  or rigs, 
  it also depends on who you 're tethering to . 
  for instance , ck 's rift will almost always trigger the tether-slow , so it 's important to know these little hero-dependent tricks . 
  hot keys for items only work if you have a consistent system for item placement in slots . 
  pressing z does n't help if you put treads in your first slot this game instead of bottle . 
  the idea is that the matchmaker does n't know for sure that you are n't a pro player starting a new account , so it will match you with a very wide variety of players to quickly understand how strong your play skills are . 
  but seriously , you need to play a few games against bots to get the hang of it . 
  i remember my first few games getting comprehensively beaten by bots on easy . 
  the matchmaking is n't an open process . 
  perhaps you fit the profile of a smurf account and it decided to test you . 
  if you play more games , like 5 humans vs 5 bots , it will get a better idea of your stats and make better decisions . 
  i think it may count humans vs a team of bots though . 
  `` it 's not about sending a message ; it 's about the * money * '', 
  yes . 
  of course you then spend some of it defending it . 
  i 've been playing for a week now , i still get beaten by bots . 
  especially since all they will be doing is saying `` we received $ 5000 from / u / _ rookieblue , that means $ 1600 goes into this etf , $ 1600 goes into this one , $ 800 into this one over here , $ 500 into this one , $ 490 into that one and $ 10 for management costs '', 
  i 'm not saying that 's a bad thing - heck , if you want to invest weekly amounts then a managed fund is a damn good idea , but it 's also not something that 's impossible to do yourself .

  i use [ evernus ] ( http://evernus.com ) and [ eve-industry ] ( http://eve-industry.org/calc/ ) the most . 
  that turns out not to be the case . 
  `` effecting the damage '' means to instigate or create . 
  `` affecting the damage '' means to modify . 
  bonus points if paired with chaos knight , which also has an abusive level 2 , and really wants your cm aura at level 3 . 
  when phantom lancer 's ultimate triggers , it will close the shop window if it 's open , so plan your item build beforehand . 
  or frost armour from a lich, 
  registry wedding , dinner at a nice restaurant for a reception , with enough left over for serious amounts of wine if you bring your own . 
  my mistake . 
  if the economy heads south , there are certain sectors that make more money . 
  similarly , when the aud is high , certain sectors ( e.g. 
  travel ) make more money , and so forth for any conceivable situation . 
  so i can * clearly * not choose the wine in front of * you * . 
  the first rule of freight club is that you do n't talk about freight club . 
  but you can google it and apply in game . 
  those are alliances , groups of corporations . 
  technically , some are coalitions : groups of allied alliances . 
  there 's a kick-started history of eve book in the works . 
  congratulations on the flood of buddy rewards . 
  australia , canada and the uk all lurched to the right last election . 
  there 's a good chance that will self-correct . 
  not so cool if he cleans up a cyclist instead though . 
  yep . 
  run simulations before using real money . 
  if you need something to test your analysis on , get a trial account on eve online . 
  there 's an import prices button on the orders menu . 
  that will highlight any outbid orders in red . 
  i really like the suggestion he made for raffles ( and guaranteed subscription rewards i guess ) :, 
  * if it does n't cost anything to be eligible for a raffle , you can do anything you want . 
  * if the raffle is behind an isk pay wall , then you can not raffle out-of-game prizes . 
  * if the raffle is behind a rl paywall , then you can not raffle in-game prizes . 
  i do n't know about you , but i gave evernus my api key and the orders and transactions turn up whenever i sync ( including expired/fulfilled ones for a certain period of time ) . 
  then pressing the import prices button will spawn off 700 price requests that i watch tick down to zero . 
  the only thing that annoys me is that it picks up the ` cost price ' from your actual buy orders , but not from immediate purchases , so you have to right click -  add to custom costs manually . 
  that 's a lot of eggs in one basket if op already has a house . 
  it 's basically all in on the housing market , which seems somewhere between slightly and completely crazy . 
  can i see your working please ? 
  i think it 's only rmt if he knew he was going to get the oreo beforehand . 
  otherwise i 'll send a dollar to all the people who bought stuff off me in jita and get them banned . 
  they get income via rent ( and since housing prices are lower , the yields are n't terrible like here ), 
  it 's a crazy idea , but it might just work . 
  try \\, 
  in retrospect , he could n't even ignore the orders , because his career would have been over after he safely reached his destination . 
  and have the americans improved on the idea so much by trading it between the kennedys , bushes and clintons . 
  phase rarely , treads maybe if you 're trying to carry . 
  either , but i 'd probably go arcane in more situations , he 's good to hold auras and team fight stuff even when he 's position 2 or 3 . 
  re quelling :, 
  * quell on pl ( 51 73 ) gives 20-29 bonus, 
  * quell on dr ( 44 55 ) gives 6-8 bonus, 
  * wraith band gives 9 bonus plus stats , so it 's clearly better on ranged . 
  or if he does n't want to come back , give it away during the next plex4good . 
  i was getting * wrecked * doing last hitting training in mid . 
  i was lucky to get 50 % . 
  right click  jettison self-respect . 
  on the other hand , you know you 'll need * something * to retire on , and being capped at a thousand a year stops you locking away too much . 
  how do you find ioof anyway ? 
  are they actually any good ? 
  from what i read , vhy has a higher fraction in dividend producing shares , so that 's good if you want money instead of pure stock growth . 
  probably a lot better for retirees than regular workers . 
  so , repaying that loan is a guaranteed 8.69 percent yield , and it 's tax free to boot . 
  seems like a really good choice . 
  buying on july 1 will save you a tiny bit of paperwork , but it really is only a tiny amount . 
  yeah . 
  the important thing for you is to set yourself up for success in the future . 
  ing gets a bit of margin by investing in their own cash products , which saves them going to finance them . 
  as with all things , do your sums i guess . 
  dropsuit upgrades skill tree will soak a lot of sp . 
  aside from equipment skills and maybe cardiac regulation , hand to hand combat and the equipment skills , all relevant skills should be trained to v. equipment skills are good to have at v but you can get away with iii . 
  after that , you probably need some weapon skills . 
  use militia versions for a while until you find one you like . 
  you 'll need at least one rifle , one sidearm and a selection of role-based weapons like swarm launchers or anti-tank grenades/remote explosives , depending on role . 
  as far as drop suits and weapons go , do n't spread yourself too thin .
