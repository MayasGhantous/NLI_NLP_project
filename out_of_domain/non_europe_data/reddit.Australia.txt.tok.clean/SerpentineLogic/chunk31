  just needs ` captain ' on his resume ... 
  drakes : yes . 
  nighthawks : yes , but still often active tanked for the extra dps, 
  tengus : most tengus are buffer ( pvp ) or active ( pve ) shield tanked . 
  the passive tanked tengus are for afk missioning or level 5 mission running only ; outside those roles they are unambiguously sub-optimal .

  you try not hating eve players after that . 
  they do .

  the idea is to not look like you 're ** too ** easy though , or you 'll end up on aca .

  red vs blue accounts for [ 41 % of all pvp ] ( http://twitter.com/#!/ccp_diagoras/status/189778028769968131 ) combat in high-sec space . 
  that 's a * lot * of opportunities to gain experience in . 
  there 's a [ list of corps here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/lpyqz/firstever_eve_subreddit_job_fair/ ) . 
  the ones most likely to fit your need of noob-friendly piracy are :, 
  * black rebel rifter club, 
  * red vs blue, 
  * any of the nullsec alliances that will accept you . 
  not exactly a kodiak moment . 
  a titan player [ has a thread ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?6297-supercapital-balancing-an-educated-opinion ) on failheap , where he puts his views on supercap balancing . 
  the main point he has is that supercaps have no natural counter , save by an absolute horde of smaller ships . 
  unfortunately , this does n't scale , since you can then bring 40 more titans , but where will your opponent find another 3000 logged in players to kill them ? 
  ( and then the node dies ), 
  the fact is , titans and supercarriers find it easy to kill the ships most likely to threaten them - dreadnaughts . 
  damage-dealing capital and supercapital ships need to change roles such that they can only kill things the same size * or bigger * . 
  this will probably mean a lot of changes ( including to doomsday devices ) but the alternative is the continued race to the top of the food chain . 
  they 're the worst kind : cannibal pirates . 
  they prey upon * each other * . 
  \\* cue dramatic music \\*, 
  well , massed dreadnaughts do pretty well against titans and supercaps already ( 13000 dps output from each moros ) . 
  there are problems though . 
  * massed titans just doomsday the dreads as they cyno in, 
  * dreads must go into siege mode and thus only have local tanks , whereas supercaps have access to ( lots of ) remote reps, 
  * dreads are immobile in siege mode , but supercaps are still mobile ( and ca n't even be webbed ), 
  * imobile dreads are sitting ducks vs vs titan guns and supercarrier fighter-bombers, 
  * dreads ca n't point supercaps . 
  some of these issues are manageable but , in aggregate , dreads pop much faster than is sustainable to effectively fight supers . 
  so in summary , dread dps vs supers is fine ; supercap dps and resiliency vs dreads are not fine . 
   means that you need subcaps to kill dreadnaughts , but the dreadnaughts can kill titans . 
  regardless of the quibbling details we 're arguing about , this is 100 % what we want to happen . 
  what lordsservant proposed ( dreads kill supers , supers do n't kill dreads ) would even this playing field , since capitals can be built in low-sec , so if an established alliance brings out the supercaps , any up-and-coming alliance can theoretically counter them . 
  5 minutes is still reasonable imo . 
  that 's the price you pay for quite impressive bonuses . 
  after you get out of siege , you can then get repped up by friendlies , so it 's not a total death sentence . 
   titans give a boost to fleets and can be used against carriers/super carriers and other titans . 
   super carriers are good against subcaps/dreadnaughts . 
  er , so basically you bring a mixed fleet of supercaps and you can kill anything ? 
  you might want to rethink which ships should counter what . 
  the problem is that you 're bringing a ` mixed fleet ' consisting only of the most durable ships in the game . 
   and this is not my original point , which was why not give dreads a resist to doomsday/xl rounds ? 
  either as a ship bonus or as a shield module to provide resists ? 
  perhaps make sieged dreads and carriers gain stupid resists vs doomsdays , so they do n't get blapped so easily . 
  i do n't think the remote rep change is necessary , for this reason :, 
  once dreads become not-completely-suicidal against supercaps , it will be come a valid tactic to go into siege to kill carriers and supercarriers . 
  i would , however , suggest that the remote rep range bonus of supercarriers be removed . 
  if they want to go pantheon , they 'll have to cluster together . 
  this makes it easier to hot drop them with dreads , instead of having to chase after each one with capital ships while being shot at . 
  ah , the ostrich approach to no-local , 
  or religious texts , 
  i believe you meant 20 000 mad bastards . 
  just think of what they would have done if the koreans were smuggling fruit in instead . 
  tech 2 bombs .

  combat boosters are like buff potions in other mmos . 
  each booster provides a fixed strength buff to a certain attribute , and a percentage chance of one of four debuffs . 
  ** game mechanics **, 
  booster duration is 30-60 minutes , based on the biology skill , except for quafe zero which is twice as long . 
  there are three classes of booster , and taking another booster of the same class while one is active will do nothing . 
  the classes are, 
  * gunnery-related boosters, 
  * missile-related boosters, 
  * tank-related boosters, 
  so you can have one of each type active at once , but not two gunnery-related ones . 
  booster effects are n't stacking penalized , just like implants . 
  this is pretty neat . 
  boosters stronger than synth strength are illegal in highsec . 
  travelling through gates with them in your cargo hold will usually end with you beinf fined or the drugs being confiscated , unless you know what you 're doing . 
  however , using them in-station is legal and then you can fly where you want . 
  illegal boosters ca n't be put into courier or sell contracts , but they can be asked for in ` want to buy ' contracts .
