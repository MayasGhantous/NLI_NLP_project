  i 'm a bit light on etfs but i plan to increase my holdings . 
  my plan is this :, 
  decide on what mix of markets i want ( 10 % this , 25 % that one , 30 % this one over here etc ), 
  buy some in that ratio, 
  once every 6 months , look at the ratios based on market movements , top up the etfs so they 're at the correct ratio . 
  the fees are higher than the us , but they 're not terrible . 
  i just did last hit training and got 34 . 
  at least i know i 'm about average for a new player . 
  to avoid wallet pvp, 
  i can not into mathematics, 
  thank flight centre for breaking the travel industry cartel . 
  apparently they do n't even need the dust implant . 
  yeah , that . 
  if it even has historical missions i 'll be surprised . 
  why is it rubbish ? 
  i think it 's a great idea , but it 's likely to push plex prices through the roof if it were an unlimited offer . 
  i do n't really go for individual stocks any more . 
  you can cheat by looking at the managed funds that use a mix of etfs to do their thing . 
  eg vanguard managed funds invest in vanguard etfs . 
  blockade runners have a much lower barrier to entry and are ideal for situations where you are n't willing to risk a 6b isk cap ship to make a delivery . 
  also , sometimes it 's a lot easier to pop through a wormhole in a small ship . 
  that 's actually not a terrible idea . 
  there are other ways to do it . 
  for instance , perpetuum increases your lock time based on how many ships ( friendly or not ) within a certain range . 
  so , if you 're in a blob , good luck targeting anything . 
  this means that , by necessity , blobs split up , then other blobs try to get close so they ca n't get alphad , and things get interesting quickly . 
  risk/reward . 
  that requires mods to mess with the css , but they did it for [ spoiler tags ] ( / spoiler ) so it 's possible . 
  dm ; ms, 
  one might argue that an important role of government is to redistribute wealth to stop the snowball effect of money -  more money -  dynasties -  aristocracy . 
  taxes are a really good way to do this . 
  perhaps volunteer your time instead . 
  heck , you might pick up some merch , 
  say you 're negotiating to buy a tv . 
  you think the tv is worth $ 300 . 
  leading with `` i 'll buy your tv for $ 300 '' is stupid . 
  they 'll counter with `` i 'll sell for $ 500 '' and the negotiation is framed in such a way that you 'll always pay more than you want . 
  if instead you say `` i 'll buy your tv for $ 100 '' , then even if they counter with $ 500 , you can negotiate up to a number that 's closer to where you want . 
  i learned python just for eve-related stuff . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  in that case , it does n't matter who gets the presidency , because no governing is going to happen . 
  er , i do n't think this is the right place for it . 
  if you login to your account at secure.eveonline.com there may be offers to come back at a reduced price , but this is just for players getting new accounts . 
  also there was such a thing as the [ recall program ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/eve-recall-program-ends/ ) , but it only existed for a few months . 
  til i 'm also that low . 
  this would be a great iama if it pans out . 
  so they 're the default choice , but if you want you can get your employer to put it into a different fund , right ? 
  yes , you can set extraction rates from 30 minutes to a week or two , so it 's quite convenient to time the extraction cycle with when you 're ready to start playing . 
  ok , faction control towers are kinda nice . 
  yes , they 're only sold on contracts . 
  so , how much should you charge for it ? 
  well , assuming it 's not a small or medium , and that it 's me0 , the calculations say [ around 85m ] ( http://eve-industry.org/calc/?q=blood+control&amp;techlevel=1&amp;id=27682&amp;runs=1&amp;te=0&amp;me=0&amp;materials_modifier=1&amp;cte=20&amp;cme=10&amp;c_materials_modifier=1&amp;enc=5&amp;dc1=5&amp;dc2=5&amp;decryptor=0&amp;skill_m=0.80&amp;implant_m=1.0&amp;facility_m=1&amp;solarsystem_m=osmon&amp;taxrate_m=10&amp;skill_mc=0.80&amp;implant_mc=1.0&amp;facility_mc=1&amp;solarsystem_mc=osmon&amp;taxrate_mc=10&amp;skill_te=0.75&amp;implant_te=1.0&amp;facility_te=1&amp;solarsystem_te=osmon&amp;taxrate_te=10&amp;skill_me=0.75&amp;implant_me=1.0&amp;facility_me=1&amp;solarsystem_me=osmon&amp;taxrate_me=10&amp;skill_c=0.75&amp;implant_c=1.0&amp;facility_c=1&amp;solarsystem_c=osmon&amp;taxrate_c=10&amp;facility_i=1&amp;solarsystem_i=osmon&amp;taxrate_i=10&amp;advanced_industry=5 ) , which is what they sell for , minus the cost to build . 
  so , if you sell for 85m , you 'll make all the profit but the manufacturer will make zero . 
  probably best to lower your price a bit . 
  you 'll have to do your sums . 
  it 's very dependent on where you are and whose orders are on the market . 
  the point is , if you 're rich you can bend over , if you 're not , you ca n't afford to pay money for experience . 
  it 's not healthy for society . 
  tell me more about how i 'm promoting my blog by linking to an image i took a year ago . 
  perhaps then you could explain why linking to an image hosted elsewhere is n't ` promoting imgur ' or linking to a voice recording is n't ` promoting soundcloud ' . 
  that 's quite a theme , is n't it ? 
  new dev explains a thing in real talk, 
  dev gets flamed, 
  dev starts using pr talk to avoid getting flamed, 
  / r/eve : `` ccp y u no real talk ? '', 
  first generation ipod . 
  groundbreaking for its time ; today , not so much . 
  platypus claws have venom , too . 
  warm-blooded venomous animals : only in australia . 
  and the other 10 % are sometimes retards . 
  oh yeah , nintendo game & watches . 
  that 's how i learned about this guy called mario . 
  no dota2 newbie knows how to config . 
  yes . 
  since the platypus does n't hunt with its venom , and it is n't strong enough to kill something trying to eat it , there 's a good chance it 's more for winning territory fights with other males during breeding season . 
  sanction as in `` approve of '' , not sanction as in `` impose restrictions before allowing '', 
  margin loans are 7 % or higher right now . 
  line of credit for your house is more like 4.3 %, 
  compress them , move them in an orca . 
  or some * where * else . 
  inject skill : learn it at skill level 0 . 
  it disappears into your head . 
  train to level 1 : inject it , then put level 1 at the front of your training queue . 
  everything else in your queue drops down a spot . 
  my dad was a train driver ; apparently condensed milk + coffee was how they solved the `` eight hours on this thing and i do n't even need to steer '' problem . 
  [ 4.2 % variable ] ( http://www.cua.com.au/personal-banking/home-loans/fresh-start-standard-variable-home-loan ), 
  probably a few hundred k isk a day or so . 
  in nullsec a 5 planet setup with skills at iv should get you about 12-15m / day . 
  shipping compressed minerals is pretty easy , since orcas have ore holds . 
  that does n't work for courier contracts though ; even so , a blockade runner can fit a stupid amount of compressed ore ; a couple trips will provide enough minerals for a carrier . 
  i 'll assume that you mean a t2 blueprint copy rather than an original , since you probably do n't have the 40b isk it would cost to buy a strip miner ii bpo . 
  so , whether it 's worth building or being depends on [ your calculations .

  i believe the correct term is `` with us or against us '', 
  ok , so you know you have goo -  simple reaction products -  complex reaction products -  t2 components -  t2 items . 
  simple reaction products do n't really move ( except maybe the really cheap stuff ) because you still have to go to the effort of running up a tower to do anything with them . 
  it 's the * complex * products that are actually sold on the market since you can turn them into t2 components and then into t2 items without needing a reaction tower . 
  once you have complex components , you need to then do your sums :, 
  * did you make money in this step ? 
  if so , awesome .
