  [ vov ] ( http://www.welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/images/07-minister.jpg ), 
  my first pub match was 4 supports and a troll warlord going mid . 
  he ended up going 22/0/10 and carrying us * so hard * . 
  if you want to get out of scrub tier , go mid , wreck face , win games . 
  how risky is it to buy zero items , contest the first rune then immediately buy bottle ? 
  / u/bvoid has posted a number of times that the hardest part of making a release is updating the fitting tool . 
  this is compounded by him trying to find time to open source the app so someone else can take over . 
  what would you rather he do ? 
  since the recent release added the jackdaw , expect long delays . 
  how do you handle the mana requirements of so many ultimates as well as mek ? 
  well yeah , if you do n't actually wreck face , you 're in serious trouble . 
  do n't tell me , tell * him * . 
  so , just like ccp z unveiled way back when . 
  a smart person would join the corp and contract stuff to his out-of-corp hauler alt for double-wrapping . 
  outside the redline is the burn zone . 
  no , it 's telling you to get out of the red line and go shoot stuff . 
  it depends on the employment sector , but in most cases , juniors will be paid a certain percentage of the adult minimum wage , which increases each birthday . 
  yes . 
  if you take too long to deploy , you may time out and be removed from the match for idling . 
  i have n't seen one that was actually * easy * to compare supers with . 
  i have heard good things about qsuper , but it would be good to know some numbers . 
  when one company goes up or down in price , how likely is it that each of the other companies in the asx50 also move in the same direction ? 
  this graph shows that - companies that are close to each other move in sync , companies that are far away do not move in sync . 
  corp/alliance subreddits :, 
  / r/dirtnglitter, 
  / r/evescout, 
  / r/fweddit, 
  / r/pandemichorde, 
  / r/phoebecrusadewarroom, 
  / r/wormbro, 
  any of those corporations would be happy to take someone under their wing . 
  i 'm a big fan of dreddit , because they 're a bit hungrier for newbros to smother with attention . 
  they 're not on that list , so no . 
  it 's highly dependent on other players ' orders , is n't it ? 
  plus whether you have access to a refining array in a corporate tower or not , etc. 
  you might get some kind of idea here , though :, 
  you 'll have to click the settings button to adjust the tool to cater for your skills . 
  at one stage , 20 % of all isk created each day in dust was due to alt farming . 
  personally , i do n't think ccp really cares too much any more though . 
  i 'm sure they have stats for these things , and if it becomes a problem , they start banning people until it stops . 
  did i get this right ? 
  mid is having a tough matchup and his bottle is empty, 
  a support player just respawned and wants to help mid . 
  support starts to teleport to t1 mid tower, 
  mid falls back to stand next to the tp location, 
  support arrives, 
  *** fountain aura fills up bottle ***, 
  *** mid uses bottle up to x times while bottle is still filling up due to aura ***, 
  mid goes back to the creep wave , healed up and with a full bottle, 
  support goes off to ward or something, 
  ah ok , so the support will ctrl-click the bottle onto the mid player a few times , then hand it back . 
  i think the mid gives the bottle to the support as soon as he arrives . 
  yeah , but on the flip side , if they really are after a job for their interior decorator mate , then a new couch and rug will just piss them off because that money ` should have ' been spent on them instead . 
  you need to talk to the other owners to work out whether it 's a targeted thing or a building-wide shakedown . 
  if so , you need to realise that management is not actually interested in negotiating a settlement that 's best for all parties ; they 're just interested in # 1 . 
  it depends on whether dreddit is recruiting ... 
  yes , one can . 
  it 's a pretty significant amount of in-game money though , and obviously worth $ 15 since it pays for a month 's subscription . 
  however , i 'd rather save the plex and donate it to the next eve charity appeal then give it to you . 
  no offence . 
  you 're welcome to check in from tine to time with a trial account . 
  i went through a half dozen trials before subscribing . 
  but you are correct , if you ca n't afford the subscription from discretionary income then it would be prudent to stick to f2p games like dota2 etc. 
  work out how much profit someone would make from the blueprint ; it 's less than that number . 
  you could , sure . 
  if you enjoy star citizen-style games , though , maybe pick up an oculus rift for christmas , trick out your pc and play eve valkyrie , build up a reddit corporation there , do fun stuff , use your money to get a leg up , 
  real-time tied in ? 
  probably not . 
  it 's set in the same universe though . 
  yeah . 
  a lot of budding traders pony up a plex for starting capital , with the idea that they will recoup that investment through their trading , and eventually get ahead . 
  a guide to literally bootstrapping yourself from zero . 
  if you know an owner who lives nearby , perhaps they could door knock ? 
  same speed . 
  you can test it if you fit a survey scanner . 
  to get lasers on different asteroids , just ctrl-click until you have a couple of asteroids locked , then click one laser to turn it on , then click the other rock and the targeting circle should way to that , then you can click the other laser . 
  well you could trust the govohwhoamikidding, 
  wrecking shots, 
  buying your own wards is good , too . 
  that peace of mind will allow you to recoup the outlay with last hits very quickly . 
  fozzie is a game designer , for community stuff you want / u/ccp _ manifest or guard, 
  yeah , you should do your own tax while it 's still easy to do . 
  mining effort is not taxed anyway . 
  yes . 
  using an entosis link on something with a high sov index is less fun than mining . 
  game is hard, 
  tortellini 's guide is really good . 
  they do , judging by how often they seem to be * on * them . 
  it matters because in the us , being a socialist is an insult , and it should n't be . 
  ok , well bit coin , like gold , is treated as a commodity by the tax office , so buying and selling them for a profit is a capital gains event . 
  it shows . 
  i guess it 's a sensible strategy to make dumpsters full of money first , then work on the truly outrageous tech . 
  you buy it * from other players * for in-game currency , but yeah . 
  it was pioneered by eve online , and it 's a big part of why it still exists . 
  stamping out real-money trading is a big operational cost to a mmo , so being able to say `` stop buying from shady sites and getting your account details hacked , when you can use the official web site and buy game time from an existing player '', 
  it 's generally best to create two characters if you want to do industrial stuff as well as combat . 
  the skill overlap between pve combat and pvp combat is pretty good ; the overlap between manufacturing and combat is practically zero . 
  hell , i rarely even undock with my industrial character . 
  my industrial character has funded my combat character for the last 2 years , so yeah . 
  even when i was still ramping up , being able to occasionally purchase a month 's play time meant that i could extend a 6-month subscription into almost a year 's worth of time .
