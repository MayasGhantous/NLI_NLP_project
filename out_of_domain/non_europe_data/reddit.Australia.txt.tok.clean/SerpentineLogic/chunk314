  before that , my combat character would get into a ship and kill npc pirates , which was more income while i was playing but obviously zero while i was offline . 
  trade and industry , however , happens 24/7 so the effort ratio is way lower . 
  you can only have one character per account training skills at a time , but you can pause one character , log in the other and resume . 
  also , just like game time , you can buy multiple character training time from other players , if that appeals .

  wow , have n't posted there since 2011 . 
  i 'd much prefer you to ask for plex donations to deliver features on open-source alliance auth systems . 
  they send it out in batches , but last i heard , they 've already sent invitations to almost everyone who signed up on the first day . 
  my logi is ready, 
  there 's lots already out there , like brave , j4lp , pizza and [ alliance-auth ] ( https://github.com/r4stl1n/allianceauth ) . 
  what they need is for someone to do a gap analysis and put the missing features into one of them . 
  south america server is in brazil . 
  the link between peru and brazil is incredibly poor . 
  there 's mountains and politics in the way . 
  it 's less ping to connect to a server in the south of the us than to connect to the sam server , so they do . 
  [ til ] ( https://www.pixeldynamo.com/news/gaming/2014/10/09/33940/dota-2-servers-open-peru-chile/ ), 
  then maybe they should get diminishing rewards as they complete more opportunities . 
   logic , how does it work ? 
  do n't ask * me * . 
  ck really appreciates a bottle , arcanes or soul ring , in decreasing order of utility . 
  it 's pretty clear that ck has terrible farm . 
  even last-hitting is unreliable until the mid game . 
  the increased pace of 6.84 has played to ck 's strengths : farming heroes instead of supports , picking up good-value midgame items like drums/yasha/armlet to snowball into serious pickups like manta or heart . 
  you even see more ults at 6 , since even at worst it 's a double-damage equivalent and great for pushing . 
  the mana sustain is a real issue , though , and you really need support to keep the pressure up . 
  a support with arcanes is really helpful . 
  failing that , you can go bottle or your own set of arcanes , or if you already have hp sustain ( helm of domination or whatever ) you can pick up a soul ring . 
  bottle is the best option ; hp + mana sustain and allows you to quickly recover in between fights , plus your natural speed allows you to pick up quick runes . 
  arcanes is basically a permanent solution to mana issues , at the cost of treads . 
  the mana from soul ring allows for an instant stun or ult , so that 's nice , but unless you 're getting hp from somewhere it may cut into your post-fight hp regen . 
  in addition , it 's not ideal to lose 150hp just before creating a bunch of illusions . 
  still , it 's a viable alternative if you want to keep treads , and especially if you 're also going hod so hp sustain is n't a problem . 
  `` not good '' is one thing . 
  `` actively detrimental '' is another , imo . 
  that 's a distinct possibility .
