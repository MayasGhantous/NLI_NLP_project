  ** booster types **, 
  there 's a list of boosters [ here ] ( http://www.eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=list_of_boosters ) , i 'm not going to type it out . 
  suffice to say that even standard-strength boosters provide massive bonuses for their price , and if you pvp outside of low-sec , you 'd be an idiot to fly any expensive ship without considering taking along a booster that suits your ship . 
  ** drawbacks **, 
  each time you take a high-strength booster , you have a chance to suffer a variety of bad things . 
  the chance is based on the strength of the booster , modified slightly by skills . 
  the duration of the drawback is the same as that of the booster , modified downwards by skills . 
  a standard blue pill has a 20 % chance of one of four drawbacks . 
  however , if you are unlucky and get hit with a drawback , you then have another 20 % chance to have an * additional * drawback etc. 
  there 's a chance that you get hit with all four drawbacks , but it 's pretty small : 20 % x 20 % x 20 % x 20 % = ~ ~ 1/160000 ~ ~ er , 1/625 . 
  realistically , you 'll get between zero and one drawbacks in the majority of cases . 
  even if you get hit with a drawback , the booster still provides the buff . 
  ** making boosters **, 
  boosters are made from booster gas clouds in null - and low-sec . 
  there 's [ a guide ] ( http://www.eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=combat_booster_manufacturing ) if you want to get into it , but the people i know who are in the business say it 's barely worth doing because the demand is so low . 
  ** tips **, 
  * choose ships that do n't care about the drawbacks as much . 
  * crash is really good for drakes and stealth bombers because they do n't care about any of the drawbacks . 
  * logistics ships do n't really care about the drawbacks of mindflood , so it 's a good idea to keep a standard mindflood booster in the cargohold . 
  * drop is really good . 
  no joke . 
  * blue pill , exile and mindflood are really good for capital ships, 
  * x-instinct is really good for interceptors and armor hacs, 
  * obviously , blue pill and exile are awesome for active tanking ships . 
  yes , there 's a small chance that you get a cap size drawback , but it is counteracted by the guaranteed rep amount so even if you 're unlucky you 're not crippled . 
  you 're probably cap boosting anyway . 
  `` you break it , you buy it '',

   can we transmit the power from the generator to the people without loosing all the electricity, 
  this is not as much of an issue as you 'd think . 
  for long distances ( e.g. 
  north [ africa to europe ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/20/us-energy-eu-renewables-interview-idustre65j1zo20100620 ) ) , ultra-high voltage dc power is less lossy than ac . 
  ok , first thing is to go to [eveboard.com ] ( http://www.eveboard.com ) and set up a limited api key so we can look at what you have trained . 
  then we can give advice better suited to what you can actually use .

  fyi if you ca n't use tech 2 gyros , invulns , shield boosters and light drones , you probably do n't want to risk flying a maelstrom .
