  if you do n't * use * the clone , it 's no better than if you 'd lost it anyway . 
  do you have a dotabuff or yasp account ? 
  i have this already . 
  it 's called ` splashtop to my desktop computer to login ', 
  some people are just insecure i guess . 
  far better as pos 2 or 3 . 
  tbh this should be adjusted by valve , not us . 
  how do you incorporate feedback on your guides , and from which sources ? 
  i do n't care what their position is in-game or irl . 
  the most important thing is ** do n't be a shit csm ** . 
  tell him to quit , unless you want to watch his self-respect get flushed down the toilet . 
  i would be disappointed in sony online entertainment if they did n't at least stick the boot in when they saw the opportunity . 
  anyway , stuff like that happens all the time in business . 
  let 's partner with you on your great technology and string you along while we furiously reverse-engineer the bits that are novel and patent all the bits you did n't '' . 
  microsoft did it for * decades * ; i 'd be incredibly surprised if sony has n't done the same thing . 
  that 's kinda part of the funding . 
  `` we 'll give you this bag of money , which you will spend half of it on developing the software and keep the rest for cocaine and hookers . '', 
  let 's face it ; that 's where the good ideas have been , lately . 
  it 's probably nda 'd , just like the dust deal was . 
  because leadership i is * double * - important . 
  i hope ccp played a bunch of the top rated ones and cribbed some good ideas from them . 
  let 's not have dust 2.0, 
  you 're 22 , on $ 65k . 
  first off , that 's not terrible , so relax . 
  you should be saving , but there are limits ( at that point in your career it 's probably easier to get a $ x raise than to scrape up an extra $ x/year savings , provided you have made reasonable efforts to save ), 
  so , invest in yourself : you know you can live on $ 40k income , and you currently earn $ 65k - 10k savings . 
  that means you have $ 15k/year worth of income ( so , maybe $ 9k after tax ) that you can spend on self-improvement . 
  start a part-time bachelor of business or something , get credit for an mba , take a project management course , learn whatever makes sense to build your career . 
  we 've seen how that goes . 
  * ` final ' fantasy, 
  * ` final ' solution, 
  * ` final ' release, 
  the wk thing is a bit niche though - it 's also solvable by 2 branches . 
  the main reason that you 'd take levels in stats is if your hero gets extra benefits from them . 
  * pl illusions get + hp and + damage ( and there 's a * lot * of them ), 
  * medusa gets + hp , + damage and + int ( which turns into + hp ), 
  etc, 
  cm 's also the same - she gets enough mana from 2 branches to pull off two frostbites at level 1 . 
  of course , she then goes on to turn that into a wand or mek so the branches are n't wasted . 
  maybe that 's a * good * thing . 
  maybe once the valkyrie team has some spare devs , they 'll ~ ~ rotate mid ~ ~ go to dust/legion and work their magic . 
  i strongly suspect that if ` legion ' comes to pc it will be under hte dust 514 banner . 
  they work for chinese money , paid from subscriptions to the serenity server . 
  historically , it has been difficult to extract money out of china , so an easy way to do that is to set up a development shop there , spend the money and export the software . 
  even if valkyrie does n't get integrated into the main eve universe in a meaningful way , it can still use the corporation/mail stuff . 
  neutralising drones are n't stacking penalised either . 
  sentries into necro book 3 ? 
  i 'll allow it . 
  no stacking penalties is actually a big thing when engaging up a size class . 
  it makes up for low effectiveness if you have entire gang neuting . 
  blade mail is the same . 
  reflects all damage types . 
  please help, 
  there once was a time where you could get a lot of isk ( like , 700m ) for one of those . 
  however , it turns out that there 's a lot more eve players who want to offload their dust codes than dust players who want them , especially years later . 
  still , maybe there 's a market for alts or something ? 
  i 'll offer 100m . 
  it 's ccp saying `` there 's a lot of eve apps on android , and they 're all great at some things and bad at others . 
  how about the eve community takes the best bits of each app and makes one great semi-official app ? '', 
  let 's round to the nearest all . 
  i believe it 's, 
  * single-pull easy camp into creep wave, 
  * walk through easy camp , cut tree towards nearest camp ( probably hard camp ), 
  * aggro hard camp, 
  * hard camp follows you to easy camp , attracts creep aggro, 
  * you last-hit everything, 
  one pulled + dead creep wave every minute instead of every 2 minutes via stacking . 
  yes , it 's about as efficient as treads . 
  he also had problems with boats . 
  unless, 
  worm holes often go straight to null sec . 
  lots of countries have different intakes . 
  the us has a large number of ` family ' visas and immigrants ; australia has practically zero in comparison . 
  both of those are primarily australian shares . 
  that 's not diversified much . 
  in my opinion , diversified means having your fingers in different markets as well as different investment classes . 
  what you have now does n't meet that threshold . 
  no plus sign . 
  0/10 would not bot . 
  nah mate , sharks are no probs . 
  [ just punch them in the face ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-33729227 ) . 
   you can still order fighters ( and other drones ) to assist/guard a person in your fleet on the same grid as you . 
  i * wish * . 
  why not war ravens ? 
  new bros have their own corp - warravens auxiliaries . 
  tradition also demands referring to kotl as ` kotl of the light ', 
  anecdotally , yes , they work . 
  you get a reasonable influx of players for a very low isk payment . 
  part of the problem is that you tend to get a lot of spies and awoxers as well , so you may have to spend time weeding them out or whatever . 
  bronwyn bishop : [ did someone say ` defence ' ? 
  ] ( https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/army/about-the-army/vehicles-and-aircraft/mrh-90.aspx ), 
  probably can find it starting here :, 
  cassowaries , on the other hand , will have a go at you at the faintest provocation . 
  new zealand banned them . 
  it turned out okay . 
  might be the cdn . 
  t'amber is complaining about cors issues on slack . 
  bitter vets are angry because they expected the new sov system to solve all their problems . 
  it did n't , and a few of them forgot that * they * might be the problem . 
  that 's * clearly * ccp 's problem .
