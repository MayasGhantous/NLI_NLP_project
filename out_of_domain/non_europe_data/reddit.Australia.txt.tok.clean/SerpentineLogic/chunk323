  actually , daedalus affects illusions like all critical hits do , but since his illusions do so little damage it only makes a small difference . 
  then again , small difference times seven illusions adds up i guess . 
  i 'd be doing some training on the side , starting now . 
  * blackwater security, 
  you do know that term is very loaded , right ? 
  it 's called an estate tax . 
  so they only have two policies that are ideologically based ? 
  then they 're still miles ahead of the other parties . 
  well , they 've already had enough time to whip up a single-player campaign , which was only a ` nice to have ' according to their original development roadmap . 
  they spun off the voting machines into a separate company precisely to stop the fallout from tarring their image . 
  so , kinda rebranded but kinda not . 
  interview somewhere , it was a while ago . 
  it matters for the same reason abortion is framed as pro choice vs pro life , rather than, 
  * pro choice vs anti choice, 
  people have reactions to words that cloud their judgement before they evaluate something on its merits . 
  neutral language is important if you want to have a debate rather than win points . 
  how many syllables does ` aged ' have ? 
  settle down , grandpa, 
  if this subreddit was all like him i 'd be * fucking horrified * . 
   should n't they have used their own forums, 
  think hard about what you just wrote, 
  that 's not tanked for angels though . 
  they do n't do a lot of kinetic damage . 
  also i would put a damage control on every ship you fly until you have a year 's playing time under your belt . 
  you just need the clutch hp too much as a newbie . 
  little of column a, 
  little of column b, 
  what makes you think this is n't already in the works ? 
  super carriers get +5 % / level bonus to capital entosis link cycle times . 
  you heard it here first . 
  i think ccp has a habit of occasionally offering limited-edition items as christmas gifts , so you take your chances either way . 
  so , like * negative fatigue * ? 
  tell me more about how this would work . 
  i forgive them the occasional stupid policies . 
  i 'm just happy see * any * party manage to keep the stupidity below 20 %, 
  then they should get over their entitlement complex . 
  bad mods gon na mod badly . 
  endie is the officer-fit flagship of goon posters . 
  yeah that 's a point . 
  * index funds are a good option ; best to put in the name of the parent with the lowest income if possible, 
  * some bonds are also a good idea - i believe insurance bonds ( ? ), 
  get good tax benefits once you 've held them for ten years , so they 're a good option if you need to put the investments in the name of the primary income earner . 
  why do n't we just host an ama here , and get victori - um , someone to moderate it . 
  1 upvote = 1 like = 1 cry every time, 
  learn about swing trading . 
  you do n't need patch speculation to swing trade . 
  there just needs to be regular swings . 
  easier than 0.01 isking ~, 
  auto attack after spell cast can sometimes be good for heroes with time for a hit between aspects of their combo . 
  sometimes i feel bad for you , dude . 
  it ca n't be easy being you . 
  * alloyed tritanium beams, 
  it does n't have to be ` immediate fatigue purging ' as soon as you enter your capital system , if that 's a sticking point for you . 
  perhaps just make fatigue count down 10x faster while in your capital . 
  a single misclick can drain your entire titan of hit points . 
  the cynic in me suspects that that they 're being bankrolled by big players in the industry to see whether they can get a big win to set the precedent . 
  if they win , the entire movie industry wins . 
  if they lose , well , at least they walked away with a bucket of cash from a poor-performing movie . 
  to be fair , that 's probably where the firm belongs . 
  maybe it 's the ` merkin spelling .

  tanky as hell . 
  after that , go onto [ different barges ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/mining-barges-in-kronos/ ) according to taste , or [ exhumers ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/exhumers-in-kronos/ ) . 
  they sometimes only move the ship you 're currently in ( instead of * all * your stuff ) , so pack as much as you can into its cargo hold just in case . 
  is it usually counted as a loss or an abandon ? 
  i 've never abandoned yet . 
  true . 
  australian server has much harder games for the same mmr than us . 
  alternatively you can set up buffer storage for p1 , then swap over to the other type of pi mat every few days and then have an idle factory or two that converts the two types of p1 into a p2 .

  not least because gum trees self-prune , so even if it 's not drop bear territory you may find yourself suddenly dead from a falling branch . 
  maybe the greens are keeping both the major parties from being full retard . 
  i would have gone octarine on leshrac , and sven build was terrible for a draft where he had to be the carry , but slark build seems fine . 
  are you good with carries in general ? 
  what was different about sven ? 
  he went in the correct direction but at the wrong speed . 
  if you 're on the loan , you bloody well better be on the title . 
  however there are two types of joint ownership . 
  one of them means if you die , your friend gets the whole house . 
  the other means he does n't . 
  it 's kinda important that you choose the right one . 
  hi , that 's my link . 
  feel free to message me for tips or eve mail me in game . 
  bonus points if you 're au time zone, 
  pretty sure that 's not accurate . 
  he can hit behind him with level 1 raze . 
  i did n't even know oracle and cm were dating . 
  iirc , the edge of sf 's rightclick range is also the edge of raze 2 and raze 3 , so if you have the time to attack move , you can get quite accurate wave clears . 
  looks like eve valkyrie is ready . 
  because past 1890 , the pearl divers in broome were mostly japanese because it started needing more equipment , and aboriginal people were probably prevented from owning boats . 
  link . 
  why heart over skadi ? 
  especially since octarine core will proc off radiance burn . 
  let 's look at your purchases :, 
  8 scrolls but no courier upgrade until 15 minutes is not okay . 
  in fact , you spent 2500 gold just on teleport scrolls , that could have been a ring of aquila to help you last hit and get even more cs . 
  he could also deliver stuff to markets in thera or the various freeports in null . 
  ah , base sieges .
