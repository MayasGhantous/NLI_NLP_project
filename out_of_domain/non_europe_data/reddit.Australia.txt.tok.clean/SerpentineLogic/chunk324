  have you tried mexican dip ? 
  probably less . 
  many of those deals are `` we get the first year 's donation , you get a cut after that '', 
  or fatigue, 
  newman was a textbook case of being elected on a strong protest vote , then blowing through all your goodwill with bad decisions . 
  sound familiar ?

  we found twice as many bombers as the fbi did . 
  go team !, 
  i have it somewhere . 
  i aim for large amounts of both . 
  that will work . 
  etfs are generally the kind of things you buy in $ 5000 + chunks , so even expensive brokerage is < 0.4 % . 
  that 's why there 's a constant tension between more etfs -  spread risk and fewer etfs -  less fees . 
  you have 10k , you 're at the start of your career , it probably makes a lot of sense to just plough the entire thing into one etf and use the next lot of $ 10k to buy into an entirely new one , then keep going until you have 3 or 4 etfs . 
  well , we do n't give out financial advice here , so it can be difficult . 
  i 'm in the middle of setting up a core portfolio at the moment , actually . 
  looking at this map : http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12 ( or a chart if you prefer : https://www.quandl.com/collections/economics/stock-market-capitalization-by-country ), 
  it gives me an idea about how big each market is , and leads me to a rough rule of thumb of 40 % us exposure , 30 % world ex-usa exposure , with the rest being a mix of domestic + emerging markets . 
  i 'm still open to changing this mix , but it 's a lot better than making up an etf split based on gut feel . 
  considering that most of my assets are domestic , that means i 'll be ploughing money into international investments for a long time to rebalance . 
  my time spent playing eve online has taught me not to trust random blogs . 
  or indeed , trust anyone . 
  if anything , command ships should get a bonus to entosis links , but * not * be the smallest ship that could use one . 
  then there should be a link to cite . 
  i do n't use ion shell primarily to damage opponents , i put them on the third ( friendly ) melee creep to push hard and get gold . 
  then i put on myself when cutting waves . 
  wow that 's some next level bastardry right there . 
  the start-of-game timings are that you ion shell a creep as it passes your t1 tower , then it will be off cooldown when the creep waves hit . 
  i 've read that . 
  it 's really good . 
  one technique that struck me as obvious but worth repeating is :, 
   if you have a bunch of code that has no tests and is horribly complicated , find the canary ; a piece of code that needs everything working correctly to provide good results . 
   then add some tests to that code , so you know that if you change something , you 'll learn about it because your canary tests will break . 
  after a while , you 'll find a more canary classes , and while your test coverage will remain poor , you will at least have tests that let you say `` well i do n't know the exact cause , but i know these bits are working and this bit is n't , so i know where to start looking '', 
  words are like weapons,

  country a : `` yeah , we all hate the president and he knows it , but he does n't care . 
  he has all the guns . '', 
  country b : `` i love the ruling junta !, 
  after all , my boss is a party member . 
  also , i love my job , and my apartment and my reputation . '', 
  upside from supporting the government : zero . 
  downside from * not * supporting the government : somewhere between zero and your family being billed for the cost of the bullet that executed you . 
  which option would you take ? 
  also works for release and deployment . 
  i think people in china are sanctioned for their actions in part based in part on how their actions affect china , and the ccp 's standing to those whose opinions it cares about . 
  compare the [ melamine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_chinese_milk_scandal ) event to the [ school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sichuan_schools_corruption_scandal ) event . 
  executions were definitely on the table for the widely-publicised milk scandal . 
  not so much for the partially-covered-up school corruption issue . 
  heavy water posts to tumblr . 
  i like the concept of the air force . 
  sending their officers into combat while everyone else stays safe in another country .

  sounds intriguing . 
  do you pair off or do you get laid on a roster ? 
  that just means that the last transaction of that share was for $ 40.38 each . 
  the buy/sell spread if $ 43.62 -  $ 36 just means that there 's a fairly large disagreement between what the buyers think the share is worth , and what the sellers think it 's worth . 
  sooner or later , someone will cave in ( or a new buyer or seller will offer a more agreeable price ) and a trade will happen and the share ` price ' will be set to that number . 
  some shares have low spreads and are usually heavily traded ; others have higher spreads , and are also usually thinly traded , although the correlation is not 100 % . 
  it 's just the way of markets . 
  ok , first step is that if you have six figures to invest , other options become available to you beyond etfs . 
  for instance , vanguard may let you access their wholesale funds once you start waving $ 100k around . 
  i do n't know much about the wholesale funds but i heard that they 're actually cheaper to put money in than what it would cost you in brokerage fees to buy huge amounts of the etf . 
  if that mortgage is for your ppor , why not plough some of the money into that ? 
  after all , if you save on the 4.5 % interest , it 's like a 7-9 % yield since normally you 'd have to pay tax on actual income . 
  wait , not even [ spooning ] ( https://bitbucket.org/spooning/ ) ? 
  money you pull out of the mortgage of your ppor wo n't be classed as investment loan though . 
  in that case , you 'd have to fully pay off the mortgage , then start up a new investment loan using home equity , then you get tax deduction on the interest . 
  \\ #notallisotopes, 
  could be one particular ad causing trouble . 
  they make exceptions , possibly because the wholesale team is different from the retail team so they 're not above lowering the limits occasionally .

  the worst bit is when you see some braindead code and think `` what kind of knuckle-dragging fuckup wrote this abortion ? '', 
  and svn history shows it was you , six years ago . 
  are you trying to time the market or something ? 
  what bot difficulty are you playing at ? 
  hard or unfair ? 
  chaos knight says hi . 
  legacy code is always in old repositories, 
  primary is best , secondary is new . 
  all votes on best best best, 
  i 'll be your go-between . 
  etf no but the vanguard funds accept regular bpay deposits if that appeals . 
  how do the fees compare ? 
  pretty good to put on a huskar tho . 
  i 'd reship it . 
  that 's because we switched to subversion in 2004 or so . 
  it was cvs before that , except for a few bits that were in visual sourcesafe , which was the worst vcs i have ever encountered . 
  has n't been seen since the 2008 leak . 
  wicked . 
  i 'm really sure it does n't work . 
  they should set some hives up at uq and qut . 
  does it still cost something per year to get access to citycycle tho ? 
  i get it at level 4 , because spears 2 is so good but passive 2 is more meh . 
  i heard that if you ask nicely , you can get access to wholesale funds with 100k ...
