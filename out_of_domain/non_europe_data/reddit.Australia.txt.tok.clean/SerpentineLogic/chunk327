   ( fleet command ) : we are away . 
  yes , when i go to see a mad max movie i 'm totally expecting a life-affirming comedy . 
  it 's a buddy movie , just like shanghai noon . 
  [ and ' a bit going on between his legs ' ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/11/1410417664008_wps_1_online_war_breaks_out_ove.jpg ), 
  can you deny streaks by dying to creeps ? 
  that 's amazing , considering how resistant macs are to wankers . 
  australia has extreme mmr compression compared to , say , uswest . 
  you ca n't really compare them . 
  this is what aurum should be for . 
  coloured engine trails , cyno/jump effects , shit like that . 
  it 's one per person except the last draw which is paid subscribers only , so it just becomes a function of how long each subscriber has been watching the stream . 
  needs more glitter . 
  multiple month subscription is better value though . 
  ok , so mmr is a curve , right ? 
  and it looks like this , right ? 
   99 % 4100 ( [ source ] ( http://blog.dota2.com/2013/12/matchmaking/ ) ), 
  well yes and no . 
  ** player skill ** is on a curve . 
  the mmr curve reflects that . 
  but , there 's nothing to say that 2250 is the magical 50 % line . 
  the mmr system does n't * enforce * that . 
  in fact , it 's likely that the 50 % line changes from year to year , based on the distribution of how many players join ranked , and how many leave . 
  after all , all the mmr a new player earns is taken from other players . 
  if a veteran player leaves , then all the mmr disappears from the active pool , so the average mmr of whoever 's left drops . 
  similarly , if a new player joins ranked and feeds relentlessly and quits , then those mmr points still float around the pool of points available , raising the average . 
  so , too does each server have its own base mmr . 
  players who only play on the australian server will have one 50 % line ; players who frequent sea or usw will have different baselines . 
  sure , there will be players who go on different servers , but that percentage also varies from server to server . 
  it 's a lot easier to switch between use and usw than it is to switch from aus to usw , not least because of ping issues . 
  so , for whatever reason , a player who exclusively plays aus server with have lower mmr than someone of equivalent skill who exclusively plays , say , usw . 
  i do n't know why . 
  it probably does n't matter . 
  but , it does seem so to be a common thing where a 2k or 3k aus player moves to the us and finds they shoot up 750mmr without changing their play style . 
  crystals do n't fill up , cargo and ore holds do . 
  and you can see how full your ship is using the inventory view . 
  it shows everything you have in station , and will show cargo holds of your ships as well . 
  if you mean mining crystal * damage * ( i.e. 
  time before they break ) , then you can probably see it in the fitting view . 
  ccp has rolled out a new sovereignty model , where instead of dog piling thousands of people into one tactical grid to win a solar system , control points are distributed throughout the constellation and it becomes a race to capture enough to win the tug of war . 
  crucially , capturing a beacon can only be done when it 's not contested and there 's no way to speed it up ( except by the long-term process of stifling the economic activities of the inhabitants ) . 
  this results in multiple smaller fleets rather than two sledgehammers duking it out and crashing server nodes . 
  it does n't get as many headlines but ccp 's design goal was to dissuade players from making those server-killing fights and it has achieved that goal , at the cost of those momentous events . 
  wrong thread mate , good try tho . 
  some people are dedicated to football , or lifelike dolls of infants , or table tennis , or stamps . 
  it 's a thing , but not a strange thing . 
  numbers always win given equal skill , but given two death ball sized opponents it 's the ones who make the right decisions about how they split their forces to take the beacons who win . 
  then you need scouts , spies , etc to make sure you 're not walking into an ambush etc. 
  maybe . 
  it should even out for players who switch servers , but maybe the pros are n't as mobile as i expected . 
  i guess they have to live somewhere when they 're not at a tournament . 
  yes , the sun ** is ** trying to fucking kill you . 
  source : am australian . 
  it 's an ensemble effort . 
  er , it 's kinda the other way around . 
  vanguard etfs are non-profit and exist to follow their indexes for as low cost as possible . 
  vanguard * managed funds * invest in those etfs in various proportions . 
  they 're for-profit ; their value lies in easy access to investing more funds ( bpay etc ) , being able to swap money between funds etc. 
  they do the rebalancing for you , so if the hang seng goes nuts in either direction , they 'll sell off or buy more to keep their target ratios . 
  if you 're investing $ x per fortnight , or into a large variety of indexes , a managed fund is ideal . 
  if you 're investing 2 or 3 times per year into a couple of funds , then etfs are better . 
  are you trying to trade currency via super , or ate you just trying to get international exposure ? 
  well , manta illusions do n't . 
  yes , you represent me . 
  why are you flying a wreathe for transporting pi instead of a nano/stabbed [ epithal ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/epithal ) ? 
  iceland has , like , 300k people . 
  there 's only so many immigrants they can soak up . 
  not to mention that they 're still trying to recover from the gfc . 
  having said that , the 50 refugees they allotted is like 0.02 % of their population , so yeah , they 're actually pretty shit . 
  tldr ; asian cultures believe in the [ just world fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis ) . 
  welcome to reddit, 
  they also had a solution for undesirables . 
  a final solution , as it were . 
  0.3 % of their population is really fucking small though . 
  they could double that and still be 25 % below our intake , and we 're already mean cunts . 
  a relative of mine is in social work . 
  basically , every few years he had to try something new in his field ( family support , mental health , whatever departments ) because seeing the same issues day in day out just * got * to you . 
  at the very least , a snickers bar . 
  yes but those are predatory companies and they should be dealt with as a separate issue . 
  the tldr really should be, 
  * sukarno was at least on speaking terms with the russians, 
  * soeharto was bankrolled by the cia to oust him and set up a friendly government, 
  * soeharto decides to be a dictator , since who 's going to stop him , the us ? 
  * nobody is remotely surprised, 
   australia 's low number of refugees is due to the speed at which refugees are processed, 
  i 'd like a citation for that . 
  please explain why ? 
  you are not going to get 7 % growth sitting in a bank account , not unless interest rates are 11 % . 
  no , so he does n't have to be poor in-game . 
  even if he does n't play , he can then give it to plex4good or whatever . 
  jokes on him , you pay with your self respect, 
  nobody knows . 
  i suspect it will be the lol/evolve model ( you get basic loadouts , but pay money for sidegrades ), 
  and this , gentle reader , is why you never go full retard . 
  the labor right has a track record of sucking up to the us , it 's not really surprising . 
  my rule of thumb is :, 
  * $ 5k + chunks -  etf, 
  * small regular chunks -  managed fund, 
  * large regular chunks -  wholesale managed fund, 
  so , why not divert some of the money that would go into other investments ? 
  i do n't buy individual shares any more , except to play around with .
