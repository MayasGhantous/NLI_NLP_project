  creepy, 
  no , that was factored in as well . 
  i hope the structure rework will allow this via some kind of super-moon goo alchemy . 
  yeah sometimes it 's like `` ok we 're blue for a couple regions , so our stuff will have to be dumped halfway then traded to a character who 's blue with the next few regions , * christ this is why you only get one jf run a month * '', 
  yeah i do n't think this is a finance issue ; it 's a legal one . 
  [ fleet navitas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rttc2pm1boe ), 
  here 's one for / r/eve :, 
   do you want to build a straw man ? 
  also the server ticks at 1hz so it 's not a huge issue . 
  so you 're saying that each full cargohold pays for the cost of the ship ? 
  i think that 's an incredibly correct thing to do . 
  kaalakiota skins are so good . 
  you might get break back with aghs . 
  with additional aghs perks . 
  this interests me . 
  world of dust, 
  it 's not wrong ; it 's not as if you 're blowing the cash on hookers and ice . 
  however , you 're right in that it is money that does n't help you with a house . 
  if you were n't self-employed , your super would rise about $ 600/month at your income level . 
  so , you 're currently putting in 800 +160 , or about $ 4000/year extra . 
  personally , i 'd only start putting extra money into super when you were further into the 80k-180k tax bracket , rather than skirting the bottom edge . 
  this implies supports like abaddon and warlock , who have heal/nukes and like a bit of farm . 
  well it does need to compare favourably with silver edge to be worth taking . 
  it does n't need to be * strictly * better : being better during a duel but worse outside of duels is a-ok . 
  edge does +225 nuke + break and continual effects based on sange and shadow blade . 
  the continual effect is not really relevant given that sb and blink are initiation items rather than bought for their bonuses , and aghs + sange are about the same price as edge . 
  so , the main difference is break + nuke . 
  perhaps the aghs needs a free pta effect when you duel in addition to the break , like enigma 's and od 's aghs does . 
  that will provide 120 as and 300 + healing for zero mana and zero cast point . 
  this means that you might be able to take crits instead of mjolnir because you have your as covered during duels , and allows you to double down on duel damage at the expense of flexibility . 
  and that 's okay . 
  so , should we follow the github repo or the bitbucket one ? 
  perhaps he should have finished the training . 
  you know why . 
  it 's not about your assets , it 's about replacing your losses . 
  if you have 1m isk in the bank but all your losses are replaced by ship replacement programme and occasional loot , then you should be hung ho about pvp . 
  conversely , if you have to pay for all of your own losses and are terrible at earning isk and equally terrible at earning rl money for plex , then you have no choice but to be risk averse ( or , you know , improve ) . 
  that 's one opinion . 
  also he had about 6 beers beforehand . 
  and then oracle ult is so damn good on huskar, 
  yeah , people quit eve like they 'd quit anything else . 
  sure , they still have accounts like i still have magic : the gathering cards , but if you, 
  a ) do n't play , and, 
  b ) do n't follow the news/meta/tournament scene/whatever, 
  then yes , you have actually quit . 
  since you seem to still be interested in the new , then no , you have n't actually quit ; you 've just taken some time away from the game . 
  i would , but only because i really want , e.g. 
  a * particular * sons of eden shiraz viognier . 
  for wine i have n't already tried , yeah , 30-40 bucks is about my limit . 
  i 've had grange hermitage and it 's good , but not really worth $ 90/glass to me . 
  obligatory plug for http://www.evemeet.net, 
  but he wo n't die until the ult ends . 
  hopefully he will have cast his heal during that time , otherwise he will die immediately , but the healing will be doubled when he comes out of ult . 
  well , he was on the boxing team . 
  you ca n't expect a budding politician to use * words * do you ?

  um , you know that people have brains and can remember things right ? 
  they do n't need an app to find out where they picked you up and dropped you off ; they just have to look out the car window . 
  most subtle 9/11 reference ever . 
  why high yield over vas ? 
  are you transitioning to retirement ? 
   it seems overweight australia to me . 
  i share this opinion . 
  if you were going for a one-fund strategy , that 's actually totally legit . 
  ( the 3 % is probably covered by your super ), 
  sugar kyle has some tips . 
  i think the main one is know your audience , and the second one is that selling a small selection of complete fits is better than selling a wide variety of stuff you ca n't make a legit fit from . 
  why not eggs then . 
  do you need currency hedging and are willing to pay a little bit more management fees for that , or do n't you care because you plan on dividend reinvestment anyway ? 
  fyi :, 
   vanguard 's research suggests that the optimal global equity allocation should be somewhere between 50 % weighting and the 96.2 % market cap-weighting .

  while it 's fine to have a favourite hero , you will often find that the game 's draft means that other heroes are a better choice . 
  you 're better off having a go-to suite of heroes in each role , e.g. 
  * carry ( there are a few different types , so even here you may have to learn a couple ), 
  * offlaner ( there are different styles of offlaner - sometimes melee offlaners just wo n't cut it in a particular game ), 
  * jungler/roamer/greedy support, 
  * hard support , because sometimes there 's already 3 carries and a spirit breaker :(, 
  start with one hero from each role and spread out after you become decent . 
  can i still watch if i 'm already a person ? 
  that 's a really shit infographic . 
  did the designer not know about graphs ? 
  look up videos of bob katter . 
  he 's a politician from inland queensland . 
  pumps fist furtively, 
  so you shout out dokdo supremacy because that 's your corp name ? 
  i wonder who owns the corp with ticker white . 
  you 're implying that sion never stops politicking ? 
  well i * never * . 
  so can we go back to urging others to commit suicide now ?
