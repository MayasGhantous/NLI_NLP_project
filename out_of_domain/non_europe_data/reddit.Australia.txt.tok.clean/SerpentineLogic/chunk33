   * the ` pose ' icons within character creation and re-customization now display a clearer representation of the actual pose . 
   * the `` leaf '' groups in the market can now be collapsed like all the other groups . 
   * the most common user interface elements used to represent players can now be dragged over to various edit fields to add the characters name .

   * entries in most table like scrolls can be copied with ctrl + c.

  yeah , past a few months you do tend to learn the different sounds babies make ; milk ends up being ` ne ' or ` le ' sounds as they use their tongue on the roof of their mouths , nappy is usually more of an ` oah ' sound , and being tired is similar but tend to be more sad than angry . 
  of course , if you 're not sure , a baby making chugging motions can provide a really helpful clue at 3am . 
  check eve-central for locations , or hang out in shady chat channels . 
  personally , i get my boosters from leboe . 
  synth x-instinct is used , as are mind flood , blue pill , exile , drop and crash . 
  the others , not so much imo . 
  but generally only if you do n't have any standard ones . 
  what people think he said :, 
  `` i 'm sorry for describing jews as intellectually inferior '', 
  what he actually said, 
  `` i 'm sorry , but jews are intellectually inferior '', 
  is n't that korean ? 
  so , now they have enough wings to play axis and allies ? 
  now they have an extra one hundred account ids to keep an eye on . 
  you 're missing, 
  * advanced drone interfacing ( this is * so * good ), 
  * electronic warfare drone interfacing, 
  i have [ a post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/s1qp4/passive_armor_vs_passive_shield_tanking/c4ae8hr ) about tanking . 
  you might find it enlightening . 
  you have no armor compensation skills , so you ca n't use a pvp armor tank . 
  i suggest concentrating on shield tanking skills for the time being . 
  * shield operation v ( for xl shield booster ), 
  * advanced drone interfacing iii +, 
  * advanced weapon upgrades iv +, 
  * large autocannon specialization i +, 
  you should be able to fit the [ artillery mael ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/s5nvh/wasted_my_money/c4baknp ) linked , with the possible exception of the shield boost amp ( i just pick up a cheap faction one , but meta-level sbas are also fine ), 
  if you ca n't or choose not to fit artillery , you can always roll with 800mm autos for less powergrid needs . 
  first , get him used to pvp combat . 
  put together a few dozen frigates in a few different fits , then join red vs blue ( both of you ) and pew together in a two-man wolfpack . 
  after that , you can get in slightly larger ships and go hunting in nearby low-sec . 
  or the bentusi from homeworld . 
  god i love tha game . 
  just bridge in a rapier and a bunch of bombers , cyno in a carrier , then some of the bombers reship to dictors and hictors . 
  thecommie386 , meet the nighthawk . 
  no worries, 
  i think that inferring superiority based on whose religion wants them to the biggest geometric shapes * lacks nuance * . 
   why is everyone suggesting advanced drone interfacing ? 
  because it doubles the dps of the drones used to clear off tackling frigates ? 
  it 's not as if you can get rid of them with artillery after they close . 
   all your shield resist compensation skills up to 3 at least . 
  why should he prioritise that ? 
  they only kick in when the invulns are turned off . 
  yes . 
  hold down w and click on something on your overview and you 'll start orbiting it . 
  for one thing , we know how to use the internet . 
  all the t3s are decent boosters ( although usually nobody wants information warfare boosters ) . 
  everyone loves skirmish warfare links anyway . 
  so , you will need :, 
  * leadership v ( 1x ) 4 days ? 
  * skirmish warfare v ( 2x ) 8 days ? 
  * skirmish warfare specialist iv + ( 5x ) 4 days ? 
  * warfare link specialist iv + ( 5x ) 4 days ? 
  optionally :, 
  * wing command iii + ( 8x ) 2 days ? 
  so you can can do wing boosts if nobody else has the skills, 
  * warfare link specialist v , +16 days ? 
  ( for command processors for multiple links ), 
  * skirmish warfare specialist v , +16 days ? 
  ( for tech 2 warfare links ), 
  * all the other < racial  warfare skills at iv , 4 days ? 
  because free bonuses why not ? 
  * any other < racial  warfare specialist skill , because 3 links are good , but why not run 6 ? 
  once all the skirmish skills are maxed , you end up with being able to fit warfare links on a loki that can :, 
  * lower signature radius of ships in the gang by ~ ~ -29 % ~ ~ ** -35 % **, 
  * boost the range of the gang 's propulsion jamming modules by by ~ ~ 43 % ~ ~ ** +52.73 % **, 
  * increase the speed of the gang 's afterburner and microwarpdrive modules by ~ ~ +29 % ~ ~ ** +35.16 % **, 
  of course , you 're then in a loki that ca n't actually do anything except provide links , but you can accept a lower bonus and fit a single link on any battlecruiser and just fly around in gangs , helping everyone out . 
  last i checked , photon microprocessors cost 38k isk to build from components bought from sell orders . 
  you might find that you end up doing a lot more building of t2 components than the module themselves . 
  they 're for sale because it 's trivially easy to make huge amounts of t2 bpcs faster than you could ever manufacture them . 
  there 's a town called clitoris , oh but nobody knows where it is . 
  he swam in the same swimming pool as michael j fox . 
  the connection from your client to eve is deliberately throttled to 28.8 kbs on the server side , at least for game data ( patches are excepted ), 
  i think you already know the answer to that . 
  eve batches up all the in-space-affecting actions and processes them once per second . 
  why would you need more than 28.8 k bandwidth for that ? 
  of course , the eve cluster can send data back to you at whatever rate it wants . 
  oh , is that where broski north went . 
  finally , my kylie minogue dressup will be complete . 
  makes for great bubble baths , i bet . 
  [ :o ] ( http://static.tumblr.com/i1cyzt2/mmbl9mtyp/drew1.jpg ), 
  my math skills are quite terrible , it 's true . 
  for milk , we 'd say `` milk ? '', 
  and sign the milk sign , get the milk , sign again then give it to her . 
  similarly for ` up ' while picking her up and going up stairs etc. 
  at about the three month stage , she recognised the symbols and a couple of weeks later we saw her start to sign . 
  i do n't mean to brag , but i now speak chinese like a two-year-old from listening to my wife talk to my daughter . 
  where do i begin ... 
  off the top of my head :,
