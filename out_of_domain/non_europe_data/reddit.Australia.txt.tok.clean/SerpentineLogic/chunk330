  fun fact : morsus mihi means `` bite me '' in latin . 
  i do n't know, 
  where to begin . 
  get a loan contract done up by a lawyer . 
  anything more than the principal will be income , but up to that will not . 
  also if it 's a real contract then wills and inheritance issues are avoided . 
  i do n't believe her . 
  i assume he was the villain of the week . 
  yeah but it 's more like mehk than mack, 
  professionally done , at least the first time . 
  it 's pretty cheap anyway , considering . 
  what 's the nature of the scam ? 
  ccp already has a game like that , it 's called valkyrie . 
  if your neighbours are dickheads like this one , this could save the dog 's life . 
  [ surveillance devices act 1999 ( vic ) ] ( http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/web_notes/ldms/ltobject_store/ltobjst4.nsf/dde300b846eed9c7ca257616000a3571/c93f9022f0f6bb34ca2577610032f3f3/%24file/99-21a020.pdf ) appears to say that if you 're a party to the conversation ( or it 's loud enough not to be a private conversation ) , you do n't need permission from anyone else to record it . 
  i suggest you start recording your interactions with her mum .

  during ( and after ) the irish potato famine , there was an influx of immigrants to australia and other countries . 
  apparently lots of women died in childbirth due to stunted women giving birth to well-fed babies . 
  not showing a skill bracket implies that the matchmaker had to span wildly different skill brackets to get enough players , so you ca n't really say that a game was a particular skill level because the players varied too widely .

  keeping the obit reel up to date was probably handed out as a monthly reward . 
  but they 've already signed a multi-billion dollar contract with telstra . 
  what 's the bet that both sides of the deal added huge penalties for breaking it ? 
  after all , most of the nbn board were replaced with ex-telstra directors ; even if the shit hits the fan they go back to their old jobs and ride the wave of nbn money flowing into their stock options .

  he has ( short ) range , can go invis to escape , and has a burst damage ability . 
  he is a bit squishy but his ultimate allows him to eat a creep to buff himself so that 's how you compensate . 
  hedging is important if you want the income stream , or plan to cash out the entire investment soon ^ tm . 
  if you 're just reinvesting the profits , then hedging is irrelevant , or at worst , counterproductive . 
  ask them about what they think an ` entree ' is . 
  well i do n't have a crystal ball , but with the aud being middle-of-the-road / on the high side at the moment , your downside is not huge . 
  if you were buying when the aud was 0.60 against the greenback then you 'd have a much more difficult decision to make . 
  you know that there 's a different section of the act for recent prime ministers that means he gets the full pension from day 1 , right ? 
  buy a small polycarbon engine housing blueprint and try to make a few of them . 
  if you have a trial and you give a buddy reward to another trial that subscribes , you wo n't get a sellable item ; your first trial will instead convert to a paid account with +30 days . 
  your only real option is to trust someone else and use the buddy system ( as an eve player , saying that made me feel nauseous ) . 
  i hope you choose me , 
  ^ ( references available upon request ), 
  yeah basically , although it 's a bit more than ' a few mill ' . 
  there 's less ccp oversight about the process than many people think . 
  people forget that ccp can not rely on outside sources in a he-said/she-said situation about buddy links as they can easily be faked or between two sock puppets of the same person , so the punishment for reneging is a bit patchy . 
  does nobody in sma know this already ? 
  yeah ok probably not .

  the cynic in me says `` buy a bunch of plex and then wait '',

  the main issue with learning implants is the risk aversion they cause . 
  turn them into time limited attribute boosters that persist through podding .

  go home early . 
  * waits *, 
  for what it 's worth , i disagree with aliventi 's argument , once i worked out what it actually * was * , which boiled down to `` learning boosters means that rich alliances have an unfair advantage '', 
   in a sense it creates another 5 slots ( in addition to 6-10 ) where established players can throw isk to leverage a greater advantage . 
  we have this * already * . 
  it 's called ` pirate implants ' . 
  they might add 10hp but they add a +2 circumstance modifier to spot checks so it 's balanced . 
  i 'm not sure you 've thought that through . 
  there is nothing wrong with choosing a managed fund . 
  vanguard do them , too .

  my alliance seems to have a lot of kiwis in it and keep referring to me as from the west island . 
  er , to get the buddy reward , you have to start the account from the buddy link - it 's not something you can apply retroactively . 
  no worries , we have a few guys in the eurozone too , but hey , you do n't have to join my alliance if there 's others that you prefer to hook up with . 
  the larger alliances like test have 24hr coverage just because they have so many people in them . 
  some alliances are very loose , like signal cartel , which is a confederation of explorers and scouts that rarely actually see each other in the same system . 
  yeah you can only be in one alliance at a time , but you can be in multiple chat channels . 
  sure .

  ** limited engagement timers to nda subjects **,

  * csm ropes in goodposters to advise them on that subject, 
  seems good . 
  let 's face it , it 's zero-risk free intel on hostiles that they 'll never know or be able to counteract . 
  that shit would not fly if they tried to add it today .
