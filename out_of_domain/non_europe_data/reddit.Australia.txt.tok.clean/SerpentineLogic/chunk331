  it happens . 
  instant yes . 
  overview is an example . 
  perfect , probably . 
  cargo scanner is an example ( with good skills ), 
  effortless and risk less ? 
  as jimoen says `` i offered . 
  ca n't do more than that , now '' . 
  news bot got your back m8, 
  i 'd hide too if the alternative is to make nice with mouthbreathing gamers . 
  the only people who do n't deserve to be messed with is, 
  * some of the newbies, 
  * literally nobody else, 
  an mmo is like a truck . 
  even minor things like touching up chipped paint get a lot harder when the truck is moving down the highway at the time . 
  the trick is to not make nice to them . 
  i call this malcanis ' second rule, 
  normal is zero to 2.7 k. 
  people harp about last hit training but they 're right . 
  the game is a lot easier if you 're a full item ahead from minute 5 . 
  i ca n't hit this goal because i do n't login enough . 
  my current experiment is to see how long my plex stockpile will last . 
  so far it 's been 10 months , with another year to go . 
  hellboy ? 
  snowy mountain scheme was close to being canned many times . 
  that is incredibly wrong . 
  itf means ` international taekwondo federation ', 
  ausfinance is too mainstream . 
  fi posts would just get lost in the spam . 
  +1 implants are quite cheap . 
  because slack is the new irc . 
  i have [ said it before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/399wh7/elites_having_growing_pains_over_the_new/cs2bhkm?context=2 ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/user/eveprosper i guess, 
  it 's probably just the terminology . 
  you know ? 
  a and b , x or y , not etc ? '', 
  i would n't expect the general population to be able to do boolean algebra but they should know the general concept . 
  wtf is more american than anything . 
  but yeah , if i had to send my kids to tkd classes i 'd prefer itf to wtf . 
  i would n't go that far but maybe a 50/50 australian vs rest of world split would be a good compromise . 
  depends on the customer base . 
  i mean jira query language is fine because it 's used by programmers or people who manage programmers , but does n't work for the public . 
  so you 're one of those 07 m8s . 
  what was he offered ? 
  second helpings ? 
  probably easier out of game . 
  paying off a mortgage is really , really low risk , and guarantees a return of the interest rate , grossed up up to 2x because you do n't pay tax on the savings you make . 
   i actually favour the same initial buy as you , i really think you ca n't go wrong with treads -  armlet -  heart, 
  likewise , although i 'll sometimes sneak in an s&y as third slot if heart seems out of reach . 
  well , sometimes you 're forced into an early bracer , so getting drums afterwards is an easy choice . 
  i expect driverless trains to turn up on mine sites first . 
  the cost savings are much bigger when the train drivers are being paid 180k/year ... 
   mortgages are the cheapest source of credit you can get , so once you have the repayments under control , it usually makes better sense to invest instead of paying it off early . 
  yeah but . 
  if you had a 100k loan @ 5 % and 100k windfall , you could, 
  a ) pay off the loan , saving that 5 % of post-tax money , so something like 8 % yield . 
  b ) ( your suggestion ) invest in something that gives you , say , 8 % , which turns into 5 % post-tax , so you 're no better or worse off than option ( a ), 
  c ) pay off mortgage , use home equity to get an * investment * loan because the interest , crucially , is tax-deductable , buy investment at 8 % yield , pay interest of 5 % , only pay tax on the 3 % difference . 
  yield is something like 8 +3 = 11 % . 
  hell no .

  private railroads allow for a lot more leeway .

  * bloodstone is bought for its mana regen , which he does n't * really * need because of his e , especially by the time you can farm one up . 
  probably better off with a shivas . 
  top down . 
  still in trials :, 
  * diffusal on pl ( riki ), 
  * armlet on huskar ( armlet is almost-signature on ck ), 
  * bloodstone on timber , storm, 
  * radiance on naga ( spectre ), 
  * euls on lina, 
   it 's just one big grey australia on chrome and ie . 
  stupid work . 
  well , it 's cheaper than mdma i guess . 
  you can put a cloak on almost all ships . 
  however , scan resolution penalties apply , whether the cloak is active or not , so it will take ~ twice as long to lock anything . 
  it appears that i need to [ spell it out for you .
