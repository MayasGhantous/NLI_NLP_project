  exacerbated . 
  his silencer build shows promise . 
  they need to work out what their target market is : comic book nerds who want cheap , geeky and lots of obscure stock , or graphic novel snobs who want curation , discussion , etc. 
  basically , gaming tables + coke vs couches + espresso . 
  at the moment , their best bet is to buy a rug , some couches and sponsor a few book clubs and get * them * in . 
  the hype train is carefully loading baggage, 
  i actually did this . 
  also http://www.rivercitylabs.net/, 
  my smugness knows no boundaries . 
  i was n't aware that zumba was only for old women . 
  thanks for the info . 
  rift needs to work if you lose vision when people walk uphill during the cast point . 
  i prefer the term `` karma escort '' . 
  wireless vr , sure , but mobile vr can wait a year or two . 
  presumably this is a counter push to the `` filming in abattoirs and feeds should be illegal '' bills . 
  hopefully the two sides will meet in the middle in a not-stupid place . 
  yeah a more appropriate thing would be to give +1 illusion , and maybe a * slight * increase in uptime ( more time active or less cooldown ), 
  plus mangos are cheaper now . 
  * +1 hp is pretty nice when you have 8 armour, 
  * ogre ca n't stay out of danger for long enough to get value from a clarity so being able to eat a mango and secure a kill is very strong . 
  illusions trigger it , but it does n't stack , just like desolator . 
   sorry you feel every single banker was doing rmt, 
  but that 's the way to bet . 
  ^ so ^ to ^ speak . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  would you start with double-mango ? 
  usually they provide notice before attacking . 
  a french letter , if you will . 
  some one needs to talk to torte de lini to update his guides . 
  chaos knight too . 
  `` code compliant miner , september 2015 '' medal, 
  if only . 
  phantom lancer build has a ring of protection with a note that you should build it into tranquil boots ... 
  star wars mmo had voice acting . 
  it cost fucking millions . 
  i understand your reasoning but i do n't agree . 
  no risk free , effortless intel . 
  `` the intel is too easy to get '', 
  `` sure , but you can use it too ! '', 
  * all my facepalms *, 
  tldr if you have a disability you should be really fucking happy . 
  enchantress is pretty good . 
  probably better to run medallion into crest , since at least your illusions get the evasion . 
   if you feel threatened at any stage , real or imagined , get that dvo . 
  do n't even stop to think . 
  do it . 
  i can not stress this enough . 
  drone strikes are a thing . 
  i 'd ship it . 
  then explode . 
  then reship it . 
  probably virtual machine . 
  on the other hand , contracts are in usd . 
  did it work before reborn ? 
  it 's shitty now , but for a while it was about 20 % of dusts actual isk faucet . 
  that 's a lot btw . 
  what do you suggest is an acceptable number of deaths per match ? 
  how much of a kill does an assist weigh in at ? 
  i ask because it affects how ashamed i should be . 
  alternatively , save up skill points until you 're ready for vlads , * then * spend them on mana break ? 
  because he goes vlads for sustain , then straight to necro3 to leverage his passive . 
  see http://yasp.co/matches/1824370621/purchases, 
  if you do n't understand eve , you just wo n't understand why shadoo was so justifiably irate during his armor hac rant . 
  `` crest broken '', 
  i assume epigenetics is why one identical twin can be fat but the other one is thin ? 
  and helm is cheaper in this patch , too . 
  * cheaper hod, 
  * cheaper armlet, 
  right , but once backdoor is removed , can you sneak a dominated creep into a juke spot in their base to keep it turned off ? 
  it 's not so clear . 
  option 1 : no recycling, 
  * tree -  paper ( carbon neutral ), 
  * used paper biodegrades ( carbon source ), 
  * grow a new tree ( carbon sink ), 
  * go to start, 
  net gain : zero ( -1 tree for paper , +1 tree for more paper ), 
  option 2 : recycle, 
  * tree -  paper ( carbon neutral ), 
  * paper -  recycled paper ( vaguely carbon neutral ), 
  * biodegradation is delayed, 
  net gain : zero ( -1 tree provides multiple batches of paper ), 
  recycling is just a variation of option 1 , except the paper is in circulation for longer . 
  tldr the first step is to dissolve the aluminium out of the ore , which you can then transport in liquid form . 
  the huge energy requirements is why iceland has many aluminium smelters , since their geothermal power is basically free . 
  slack is push , and you can configure per-channel ( and desktop-vs-mobile ) what kind of notifications you actually want pushed . 
  turns out it 's more hydro than geothermal . 
  but then someone outside the salt mine needs paper so they chop down a tree . 
  burn or landfill , either way is a carbon source unless you take steps ^ tm like carbon sequestration via biochar process . 
  there 's a lot of factors involved . 
  it saves on landfill , which makes local councils happy , and the recycling company might be * forced * to accept paper in order to get access to the glass and aluminium . 
  as i mentioned in another comment , there 's another aspect of recycling : using less landfill space . 
  it does n't affect the carbon cycle , but it explains why local government recycles paper even when there 's little direct environmental benefit . 
  it 's most likely neutral . 
  * growing plants is a carbon sink ( air -  plant ), 
  * plants decomposing is a carbon source ( plant -  methane , co2 , whatever ), 
  unless you can lock the carbon into the soil by turning it into charcoal or whatever . 
  only until the paper maker realises that demand has slowed , and slows down their replanting . 
  ca n't reply too busy using paper, 
  where the original paper comes from seems to be independent of whether it 's recycled afterwards or not , though . 
  whether you need 10 million sheets of paper or 10 thousand new sheets , it 's still better to take it from a tree farm than old growth forest .
