  i 'm also neglecting the fuel it takes to pick the paper up from households , drive them to a recycling facility and the energy needed to turn it back into white paper .

   christopher priest , who wrote the novel the film is based on , saw it three times as of january 5 , 2007 , and his reaction was '' ` well , holy shit . ', 
  i was thinking , ` god , i like that , ' and ` oh , i wish i 'd thought of that . ' '',

  on the other hand , my paediatrician suggested that 18-24 months is a good spacing between the birth of children , since they will be close in developmental age . 
  the average is 3 years gap between kids , and i kinda think that 's a bit too far apart . 
  information pamphlets are cheap and effective . 
  if you added up all the funding used for that , you 'd have approximately fuck-all money . 
  now i understand your username . 
  the behavioural differences between a 4yo and 2yo , and a 5yo and 2yo can be significant . 
  looking at my kids and the kids of friends and relatives , there 's a distinct age band of ` which kids will i enjoy playing with ' , and it 's about 2-3 years older/younger . 
  beyond that , and they do n't really like playing together ( primarily the older child rejects the younger ) . 
  there 's * good * restrictions ( must not be a murderer , must have roadworthy car , must have came , must display taxi meter , etc ), 
  there 's restrictions that have downsides but that are , on the whole , a * net good * thing ( must have a taxi driver 's license , which costs money and time etc ), 
  there 's also restrictions whose * downsides * may not outweigh the upsides ( taxis must have licenses as well , which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . 
  why ? 
  well , because the state government gets ( lots of ) money when it issues new licenses , and existing taxi companies are safe from competition ),

  on the other hand , i just saved myself 2b isk so i do n't have to care about the price of plex until this time next year . 
  it does n't help that none of the other 4 heroes were ones that you rush aghs on . 
  the questions i most want answered are probably under nda . 
  cherry , of course, 
  once you get levels in illuminate , your farming becomes much better . 
  once you have aghs you should buy all the consumables for your team . 
  keeper is a counter push hero . 
  level 4 illuminate can almost clear a wave by itself . 
  high ground is hard to breach if you have him . 
  you can put a left-handed bolt into an aug. 
  the effect gets better as you stack it , too . 
  i seem to get less blow out games during different time zones , possibly because of a larger match making pool on other servers .

  that 's because the shots kept coming . 
  fine , not gaol . 
  at my university , the school of engineering partnered with the school of nursing to organise group events . 
  chem and enviro were the two fields that had the most balanced gender ratio when i was at uni . 
  mining engineering , on the other hand , was a ` girls : not even once ' class . 
  what time frame are you looking at , and do you have a new emergency fund for , well emergencies ? 
  for shorter terms , term deposits and high interest savings accounts are good . 
  they 're fairly straightforward . 
  for longer terms there 's funds , individual shares and other stuff like bonds etc. 
  this is where the ultimate of your questions will probably be . 
  for serious players there 's derivatives like options etc. 
  these are the sort of things that you need to learn for your self , if only to prove to yourself that you care enough about them ( and by inference , your money ) to learn .

  i thought both rio and bhp were going equally hard at improving capacity . 
  no time to cry ; busy selling bubbles, 
  it does n't * have to * be that way though . 
  shadow shaman is similar . 
  one nuke . 
  strong disables . 
  gold coast cops are a bit dicey tho . 
  ok , so , emergency fund goes into high interest saver , rest goes into longer term investment . 
  a fund rather than individual shares is prudent , since it spreads risk . 
  i prefer funds that invest in indexes rather than try to actively manage their funds , since very few funds can outperform the index over long terms . 
  if i ever get enough super to hit that threshold , i 'll be both pleased and surprised .

  jesus christ , this game really is a second job . 
  uh , you 're trying to break linkins so you can duel . 
  duel ignores disarms . 
  at my ( low ) mmr , games are a lot fairer on sea servers due to the larger mm pool . 
  aus servers tend to be blowouts one way or the other , just due to random people being 1k higher than everyone else . 
  wow , complete lack of screenshots . 
  yeah , high growth is pretty good .
