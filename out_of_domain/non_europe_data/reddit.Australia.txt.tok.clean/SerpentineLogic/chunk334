  i prefer having some extra in the international shares bucket , to bias a bit away from domestic . 
  a lot of high growth options are < 50 % international , so going 80 % high growth/20 % international would help you get over 50 % . 
  * it should n't need a high slot for this . 
  * * all * d-scans should reveal your position for 5 seconds , whether manual or automatic . 
  if you want submarine warfare in w-space , do n't fuck about , * actually do it * . 
  why not mention it to the family involved ? 
  i mean if you can say ` guys , our last water bill was fifty bucks over , a carton or two would be appreciated ' then maybe they 'll come to the party without hurt feelings . 
  for some reason they just do n't seem as good compared to red . 
  what are you doing awake, 
  this spread happens at the 1k level too . 
  a rule of thumb i have heard is that a maximum of ( your_age_in_years ) percent of your holdings should be in a capital-stable investment , with the rest in growth investments . 
  the idea is that when you 're 20 , you can ride out the wild swings of riskier investments , but when you 're 60 , you 're way more concerned about * not losing * money , rather than gaining a bit more . 
  at which institution are you studying it ? 
  good job dodging evocca etc. 
  ok , so besides seek and careerone , there 's also stuff like http://whirlpool.net.au/jobs/?state=qld, 
  mcse is a microsoft cert that demonstrates that you 're not terrible at windows . 
  ccna is a cisco cert that demonstrates that you 're not terrible at computer networks . 
  a + is a comptia cert that demonstrates that you 're not terrible at fixing computers and other computer-based office equipment . 
  i assume you 're smashing the hell out of free training courses like https://www.codecademy.com/learn ? 
  ok cool . 
  when you 're done , you 'll need a portfolio to get your foot in the door . 
  if i were in your position i 'd put together a nice web site using angular and maybe that [ parallax ] ( http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ ) plugin that seems popular , perhaps for a local restaurant . 
  show it to them and maybe they 'll take you on as a one off client . 
  i do n't know what the going rate is , but you should be willing to compromise a lot for your first couple of clients , just to say ' i have clients . ', 
  if you need to , get paid in food ha . 
  then you can leverage that into a full time position if you want , or expand your clientele if you want to keep doing the freelance thing . 
  if you guys sold any more roses you 'd be a florist . 
  it 's * eye * murder . 
  tbh you should only pick them up if you enjoy that kind of thing . 
  if you 're interested in web dev you 're more likely to need skills in vms and cloud tech like aws . 
  chaos bolt into reality rift . 
  make sure to armlet toggle . 
  bombs we do n't give a shit about . 
  but *** fruit *** ? 
  oh , you 're fucked , son . 
  here 's how it went down . 
  * rouge joins ccp as executive producer of dust, 
  * ccp says `` hey look what we 've been doing !, 
  project legion is great !, 
  let 's kill off dust ! '', 
  * rouge says ` sounds great but whats actually funding this ? ', 
  * ccp says `` psssh '' , tells him to announce it at fanfest, 
  * rouge wedding ensues, 
  * rouge tanks the fallout, 
  * rouge works on dust to get it working again , since , you know , money coming in is nice, 
  * rouge hits structure , is running out of buffer, 
  * ccp rouge moves to executive producer , valkyrie where he can actually make a difference, 
  * in shanghai , someone whispers into the darkness , `` but , but , psssh '', 
  that could * almost * get me to fanfest . 
  on the other hand , i 'd have the most bitchin ' coffee table . 
  i would undock for this . 
  i think you know why . 
  i 've played that team fortress map . 
  it would involve a flying elephant . 
  i 'd be freaked out seeing anything on d-scan , because it means i 'm undocked . 
  when i first started playing ( which was entire weeks ago ) , i found normal bots too easy , but hard bots impossible to beat . 
  so , perhaps op should create a lobby match with , say , 2 hard/3 medium to ease himself into it . 
  why not do it the legitimate way and use a family trust ? 
  one of the guys who was attacked knows punjabi and heard them talk themselves up after damaging his car . 
  i work for a german company . 
  with my luck they 'd call it the joy division and annex poland shortly after . 
  have you considered buying etfs on the ftse instead ? 
  dickbutts . 
  brb building a runway on my tropical island . 
  sometimes people put up temporary trades to cause you to lose money like that . 
  they do it in eve as well as rl . 
  i regularly put up small ( 10km ^ 3 ) contracts for 100k/jump and they get filled quickly . 
  tbh i have an in-built emergency fund ; it 's called having $ large_sum in my offset account . 
  i used auto install . 
  the back button implied that the install did n't work . 
  no , the install worked but i pressed the back button and it said no characters were loaded . 
  when i restarted the app it was fine . 
  yep . 
  the australians did this in the training op [ silent fury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfvol7mld4 ) . 
  up to 300m, 
  can you win with that hero vs normal bots ? 
  then yes . 
  ok , so there was a guy called james bean who posted the `` it 's my tenth anniversary as a badass spy in eve ' thread . 
  turns out that he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark . 
  sometimes he would accuse avocados of being lazy . 
  the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament . 
  so eventually he got called out on his bullshit . 
  it 's on the dk2 itself , hidden under a headband or something . 
   if we get a touch here, 
  why do you not have a touch already ? 
  day trading is holding shares for a short time then selling them ( usually all the shares you bought are sold by the end of the day ) . 
  it has nothing to do with the amounts of shares you 're trading . 
  in fact , you 're more likely to see larger amounts of shares ( or options ) being traded , rather than smaller amounts . 
   okay but smaller amount of shares are still traded . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  brood mother, 
  nabtrade is $ 15 up to $ 5k trade , then $ 20 up to $ 20k . 
  and now , dear readers , watch as :18 months : becomes :1800 bucks :, 
  step 2 : draw the rest of the fucking owl [ . 
  i bought mine direct from one plus . 
  it had nothing on it, 
   caught, 
  operative word . 
  perfect is the enemy of better . 
  right , but then you have 1 card in your deck that searches for your win condition , instead of,
