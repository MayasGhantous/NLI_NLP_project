  * eye, 
  * 4 x map, 
  * ruins into map into eye, 
  ( both have the backup option of map -  ruins to grab something you threw away with thirst ), 
  i like trinket mage though , since trinket -  map -  ( tron or ruins ) is so good . 
  hayne is pretty big down under . 
  so to speak . 
  [ it 's an aussie thing ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2fzg74/i_think_this_guy_just_won_australias_biggest ), 
  on the other hand , the arcana-level skins are way more flashy than the best eve skins . 
  have you tried partying with a huskar ? 
  even if he dies from his own spears ( which is unlikely since you will also flames him and he will probably pop his own heal , and may have life steal ) , he will still wreck a * lot * of face in the 6 extra seconds you give him . 
  uh , manta is pretty good on alchemist once he has radiance , even though i dislike his skill build . 
  you can double flames both enemies and allies btw . 
  when do you pick medusa over , say , phantom lancer ? 
  we tend to tell people that just for the reaction . 
  it 's a compliment ; it meant he thought you could take a joke . 
  there 's also lots of them . 
  it 's delicious . 
  although , does n't really go with bacon and egg pizza . 
  [ egg . 
  ] ( http://aussietaste.recipes/pizza/the-aussie-egg-and-bacon-pizza/ ), 
  you 're missing out . 
  why not slack ? 
  if you buy a desolator , why not get a necro book to push just that bit harder ? 
  there 's never a bad time to eat pizza . 
  it 's surprisingly easy to hit that cap . 
  walk across the road like, 
  ` what up i am a big cock ', 
  do you not know how to squelch channels from pinging you or something ? 
  i 'm sure there 's bad points as well , though . 
  more likely we 're inoculated against bad propaganda so we lean centrist . 
  he has taken ownership of a lot of things . 
  yes , stack the entire jungle , especially the hard camps , multiple times . 
  ten minute radiance is good . 
  tldr ; nobody knows for sure , perhaps buy half now , half later ? 
  so the first thing you need to do is look at his books and find out what he charges , what his outgoings are ( like insurance , fees , taxes etc that you mentioned ), 
  his accountant may be able to help with that . 
  note that there 's a difference between what an accountant is good for ( advice ) vs what a bookkeeper is for ( the grunt work of keeping track of your money ) . 
  there are some really good programs out there for automatic bookkeeping that i suggest you look at ( or if you have a spouse , get them to look at it because you might be * a bit * busy ), 
  also you 'll need to make a clean break with regards to work already done ( his widow gets that money via existing invoices , you get any new money ), 
   and the people responsible for letting it happen pay the proper price . 
  one would think that first priority would be the people responsible for * making * it happen , i.e. 
  the militants . 
  the jerk we need, 
  ideally both , since after a while your stacks will start failing so you 'll have to move to another camp . 
  alch should be able to kill/damage both camps at the same time by pulling a bit before using acid , so you get a lot of efficiency . 
  look at meracle 's 10 minute radiance video for an example of this - ten minutes even with a few deaths is a good radiance timing . 
  it might just be the small sample size , and less sugar-coated reviews . 
  i mean , they 're apparently a worse place to work than ea games , which i find difficult to believe . 
  \\* * pours out a cup of blood on the ground * \\*, 
  \\* * hopes nobody asks why he happened to have a cup full of blood * \\*, 
  i never thought i 'd see someone actually try to deflect criticism of fox news . 
  he 's lucky he did n't step out in front of dick cheney while he was hunting . 
   and their american department was pretty much laid off because the game failed to impress during testing and was canceled, 
  this was the same department that smashed out 3 racial captain 's quarters in record time , compared to the icelandic team , so i do n't think their technical skill was the thing holding wod back . 
  that 's third-degree , mate :(, 
  sorry , they ca n't hear you over the sound of $ 92m in crowd funding . 
  ` narrative ', 
  let 's not bring * him * into it . 
  also item use ( offensive urns and medallions ) , since that does not break invis . 
  whatever you do , think hard before you spend more than 450 gold . 
  being able to get minute 0 rune and immediately buy a bottle is pretty good . 
  plus there 's a bit of scaling survivability in the radiance evasion . 
  baumi did 1175 gpm last time he went alchemist mid . 
  also life steal on radiance and maybe acid ( not sure ), 
  also , dumping aghs on other team members drops his net worth so he does n't give so much come back gold . 
  i dare someone to cosplay as an avocado . 
  this is prime sea time . 
  a pile . 
  * china : 95 % lactose intolerant, 
  although tbh most of the world is  20 % lactose intolerant except for whites . 
  when i joined a new company and proved myself in the first 12 months , i got 14 % raises for the next two years ( 14 % of my starting salary ) . 
  it slowed down after that , as you 'd expect , but 5 % per year was pretty standard . 
  i eventually left that job because they no longer offered a salary commensurate with my skill and experience . 
  how did i know that ? 
  because i kept my eye on seek and occasionally went to interviews anyway , just for the practice . 
  calibrating yourself with the rest of the market is a very important career technique ( another one is ` quit your first job once it gets stale ' ), 
   the easiest way to justify a raise is to get another job offer . 
  when a company gives a counteroffer , they 're not buying loyalty ; they 're just buying time . 
  always be prepared to actually * take * that job offer . 
  \\ #onlyshortrapists ? 
   find the market rate for your work . 
  ask them how they plan on getting you to that rate . 
  i actually did that last week . 
  turns out i 'm being paid 15 % lower than the going rate , so i expect a 10-15 % increase in the next round of contract negotiations . 
   if i attack a pos in high sec ( 0.8 ) , will concord respond ? 
  unless your corporations are at war , yes . 
   is it neccessary to buy and anchor defensive mods on a pos in high sec ? 
  if i get war decced ... cant i just pull it down and mothball it until later ? 
  you * can * , but if you have research or manufacturing jobs going , you 'll lose all the materials when you unanchor the array . 
   any other tips for high sec pos 's ? 
  if all you want is a place to compress minerals , you do n't even need to keep it online . 
  just put some fuel in , online everything , compress all the minerals you want , haul them away and offline the tower again . 
  got ta pay the bills . 
  zero if electronic . 
   we are transitioning to joint accounts and joint finances . 
  any particular reason why ? 
  ok , but you can still keep your own separate accounts too , right ? 
  it 's safe in high sec , unless there is a war declared . 
  my recollection is somewhat skimpy .
