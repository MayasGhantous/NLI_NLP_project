  in brisbane , it only happens on wednesdays , in certain pubs . 
  now there are legitimate things that a newbie can use his buddy rewards on , without getting flamed . 
  never forget . 
  newbies who get their buddy rewards are sitting on ~ 7-800m isk . 
  they get told ` do n't spend it on expensive ships yet ' ' +5 implants arent worth it ' etc etc , but now they have an easy option available to them that can not be blown up or lost when podded ; immediately get a leg up by buying some sp packs . 
  i liked that show . 
   rebuttle, 
  i find myself agreeing with you . 
  i feel slightly bewildered about that , tbh . 
  it 's been some time since i checked , but down under bar & grill near central station . 
  thanks for the compliment !, 
  i understand loading up the gank alts with sp packs , but i 'm not sure how you recycle the sp back out of them again . 
   goes to patriot rallies, 
   really a lefty, 
  another victim of the [ horseshoe effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) . 
  \\ #phew \\ #dodgedabullet \\ #notallblackmages, 
  yes , a small tower only uses 10 fuel blocks/hour or part thereof , which is like , 160k isk ? 
  i used to make a small side income buying ore for cheap in newbie systems etc , hauling it in a freighter to a compression array then selling the compressed ore in jita . 
  strangely , standard-grade compressed ore sold the best , max-grade was the next best , and the mid-grade stuff was often really cheap for some reason so i used to buy it cheap for the haul home , then throw it in a reprocessing array and make t1 ships for the newbies . 
  i wonder whether soul ring plus tranquil on lc off lane is viable . 
  i picked heroes the team needed rather than ones i knew how to play . 
  it went as badly as expected . 
  tafe is still legit , but even they are n't as cheap as they used to be . 
  maybe they have [ skulls on them ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/4ambq ) . 
  that 's firmly predicated on a high price for sp packs . 
  or even something like this, 
  it 's * not * good or quick money , no . 
  well , there will be fewer 2-plex character transfer fees , so demand will be lower . 
  let 's be fyunch ( click ) s. 
  or rather , once they expire , they go back into the redeeming system so you can only use it for game time . 
  [ [ blighted cataract ] ], 
  but you can roll it into something better after you leave . 
  compressed ore, 
  * * almost * always has a sales premium over uncompressed ore ( do your sums , maybe theres a buy opportunity ), 
  * is 100x easier to haul around than uncompressed ore, 
  * is still ~ 20x easier to haul around than minerals ( like ` one carrier worth fits into an iteron v ' ), 
  * ** allows null/lowsec manufacturers to leverage their much higher refining capability ** ( hence sales premium ), 
  if you 're just making your own stuff then compression is a nice-to-have . 
  when you 're buying billions of isk worth of raw materials to turn into dreadnaughts then , yeah , it 's a big fucking deal . 
  what 's the advantage of gifts in your deck ? 
  you monster . 
  you should also look for health insurance funds that offer low or no waiting times for new applicants , although i think many of them exclude dental from that list . 
  well , you must admit he has had a few loki breaks in his career . 
  yeah i grind skill points * so fucking hard * / s, 
  that assumes you want skill points faster than you naturally accrue them , just like ` omg everyone will sell plex ' assumes that you want isk faster than you can naturally accrue . 
  can you repeat the question, 
  why not just plug in the two you need ? 
  but it 's closer to 4.6 % + comparison rate . 
  create a dust 514 account , then . 
  so , only mention the gpa from your final year on your resume . 
  i understood that reference, 
  getting people fired is office politics 101 . 
  people who say ` oh i do n't engage in office politics ' ** lose at office politics **, 
  i have heard some great things about skymesh , but they 're not available in my suburb . 
  we should get the savant who did / r/valkyrie, 
  i do n't rightly know what you said , young man , but if you are agreeing with me , then i concur . 
  also check universities , their dental school might give mad discounts, 
  `` foster mothership '', 
  i do n't think you should run a variant rgtron base with * so few * turn-3 windmill-slam threats . 
  if you 're going to do this , then starting with a utron base would be better . 
  m.reddit.com or i.reddit.com ? 
  if that 's too hard , try the lich eat . 
  so , he placed 200k bounty on you , and you placed 10m on him . 
  and you think you somehow won this exchange ? 
  not with that attitude . 
  eat a creep at the start of the game en route to your position , makes mid have an easier match up . 
  but then you have to think about whether your 2-card infinite turns combo is easier to assemble , more resilient and easier to cast than slaver/ruins . 
  i ca n't advise you about how many temp jobs are part-time ( the only contracts i have seen have been full-time ) . 
  i can say that jobs outside your field are not useful on your resume , unless you can explicitly detail which skills or achievements you got from that job are relevant to your chosen career . 
  in fact , i 'd rather someone put on their resume `` i play eve online so i am a spreadsheet expert '' than another generic sandwich artist position .

  then once you 've caught up, 
  * http://updates.eveonline.com, 
  not nearly enough . 
  bring back the recall program, 
  check out signal cartel , they 're a bunch of explorers and are ideal as a corporation to join . 
  up to you . 
  maybe signal cartel has a public channel you can hang out in and see if they 're a better fit . 
  are you missing a tron piece in that list ? 
  ` baby overboard ', 
  weird . 
   his turn he plays his own wurmcoil . 
  end of his turn i path it , he tries to dispel , but i remand it since he 's still on one blue source . 
  did you remand his dispel , or your own path so you could recast it ? 
  agreed . 
  op , provide examples of which companies you 're looking at . 
  it only takes 7 minutes for nk to fire all that artillery at sk and level every city . 
  you 've cut red ( which is , what , 4 maindeck clasms ? 
  ) , but you have n't added enough green tech to make it worth it . 
  perhaps there 's sideboard cards or something ? 
  i 'm just not seeing any advantage over rg . 
  i can do 1080 but i hit my monthly download cap way faster , then . 
  they 'll start with [ bolivia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salar_de_uyuni ) first . 
  pretty much . 
  a typical rg tron deck has 4 r/g lands plus a lot of mana fixing and land search , but only 4 main deck red cards ( or [ fewer ] ( http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gruul-tron-gr/ ) ) . 
  more red comes in from the sideboard to shore up the aggro and combo/blue matchups since that 's what it does best . 
  rgtron 's game plan is to land high-mana-cost hard-to-remove threats turn 3 and 4 ( wurmcoil into a planeswalker ) to disrupt the opponent , then mop up . 
  if you do n't have enough wurms then something similar ( but cheap ) that 's resistant to removal , like [ [ thragtusk ] ] might work . 
  well , things were looking a lot better for our internet before the conservatives were voted in ;(, 
  long-time eve players will recognise many of the voices .
