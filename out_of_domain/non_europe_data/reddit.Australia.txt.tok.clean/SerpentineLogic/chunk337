  evetimecode.com is a thing , and there are many alternative sites .

  dust has skill point boosters ( +50 % and +100 % ) in 1 - , 3 - , 7 - and 30-day flavours . 
  you can inject up to 3 at the same time , iirc . 
  plus transfield got a massive increase in the contract terms . 
  it 's something like $ 45m/month now . 
  3 stack , not sure about max queueing , probably up to a year . 
  yes . 
  it 's not cheap though . 
  each +100 % booster is like $ 12 for 30 days ( might be substantially more , i only used to use the +50 % ones ), 
  they 're trade able but they come from aurum or rarely , random missions . 
  i think the dust market proper is still npc orders only . 
  the sun never sets on what used to be the british empire . 
  they 're like our little bros. . north island , south island , and fuck off we 're full west island . 
  rush in , get 500 gold , immediately buy boots or bottle or whatever , maybe trade kills ?

  it 's like 2am in iceland , and 10pm in atlanta . 
  lucky for you it 's 10am in shanghai . 
  i guess the sun never sets on the amarrian empire . 
  kingswood country, 
  at least hillsong gave us a good league player . 
  a lot of people in hollywood are scientologists , or at least pretend to be for their careers . 
  it 's a lot like jews and hollywood back in the 70 's ; whoopie goldburg changed her last name just on the off-chance that casting agents would think she was jewish so she 'd get a chance to audition . 
  do n't forget , zero fumbles from hayne . 
  so , not a bright spot after all :(, 
  maybe they 're doing some sort of tag team thing . 
  shout out to / r/tronmtg, 
  it works in a trinket mage ( utron ) deck . 
  that 's not very common . 
  the horror . 
  perhaps he 'll become a bike cop . 
   however the correct way to sequence ancient stirrings is n't always obvious . 
  when should you cast stirrings over any other spell ? 
  when should you crack a sphere or star for it ? 
  also , deciding what to choose once you 've assembled tron can be quite difficult ; what kind of challenging ancient stirrings decisions have you made in the past ? 
  nobody has answered this question . 
   seven and a half years, 
   can a creature equip more than one item ? 
  yes, 
   can a creature equip more than one of the same item ? 
  yes , if you have multiples in play . 
  i have n't played much since lorwyn , but i started in revised , so i have somewhat of a history , 
   please note that this eve launcher is still under development and not the final version !, 
  well duh , it 's an . exe instead of a . dmg, 
  it 's slow ( tractors only one item at a time ), 
  it 's fairly bulky, 
  2 . people can shoot it, 
  3 . you need multiples if the missing has multiple rooms ( remember to bookmark where you drop them ), 
  it does n't salvage , like a noctis can . 
  aside from that , yeah , it 's pretty neat . 
  insufficiently battle fleet gothic, 
   always cast stirrings before sylvan scrying if you 're missing 2 tron lands . 
  you want stirrings to find a 2nd piece before tutoring for the 3rd . 
  that 's good tech - you wo n't know which one to get if you do it the other way around . 
  it 's pretty hard to mess up if you train all relevant electronics , engineering and navigation skills to iii . 
  that will take you months alone : /, 
  the rigs cost a * lot * . 
  colour me unsurprised . 
   however , the german military was very much in favour of the war for personal gain, 
  nobody wants to lose a war , regardless who started it . 
  this just in : people can be entitled dicks , regardless of which country they 're born in . 
  considering it cost each ratepayer thousands of fucking dollars for that tunnel , excuse me for being salty . 
  sit or ( stand or lie ), 
  there 's a lady scarlet joke in there somewhere . 
  sometimes the site is offline . 
  broken link, 
  let 's make this clear ; he did n't kill anyone with pink batts any more than china killed bhp employees with their desire for steel . 
  good thing they had police presence , then . 
   `` but doctor ... [ i am pagliacci ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/141645-heard-joke-once-man-goes-to-doctor-says-he-s-depressed ) . '', 
  when your cap runs out , it takes a while to recover . 
  your ship will be fine ( provided you do n't need the capacitor for repairing ) . 
  peak capacitor regeneration is about 25 % ; above and below that number regen falls off . 
  2 . faction warfare can be good for noobs but you need to realise that you will always be fair game for one faction of players . 
  this is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  as for where you should go to get in fights : http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/amarr_vs_minmatar and http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/caldari_vs_gallente, 
  not dailies as such , although there 's this mission arc that 's available every 3 months : https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/the_blood-stained_stars, 
  you can find wormholes using probes , but you wo n't know exactly where they lead unless you go through them . 
  you must still be on grid to use mining drones , basically you lock up an asteroid and tell them to attack/harvest . 
  they 're kinda terrible though . 
  even my mining character does n't use them , because strip miners are a lot better and i need my drones to kill npc ships . 
  it 's a big learning experience . 
  i do n't know the answers myself . 
  some corps like test and brave newbies are all about big fights ; others like red vs blue are about constant duels , and there 's faction warfare which has a bit of everything . 
  this is n't something you need to rush , imo . 
  take your time and try a few things to see what you like . 
  as far as income goes , not much beats orbiting a control point in faction warfare for income . 
   i would assume that larrikin is well aware that titans ca n't siege . 
  i 'm fairly confident that larrikin knows more about caps than most people . 
  i recently read a [ compelling argument ] ( http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/ ) that the proper order to watch star wars is, 
  iii, 
  skip : i, 
  that 's ... not as stupid as i initially thought . 
  [ xenophons in action ] ( https://utherpendragonfly.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cantina2.jpg ), 
  would be nice if carriers could manufacture new ones in the field ... 
  apparently it 's a bit bare-bones right now .
