  crocodile tastes like pork , but saltier .

  the money implies status transfer , so they can not be separated . 
   if a man can reasonably expect to have a wife and children he will then be more inclined to not only participate but also be more productive . 
  if men do not have a stake in society then they withdraw from it which leads to all sorts of problems , empire collapsing levels of problems . 
  there 's a school of thought that radicalism in islamic countries is a by-product of multiple wives , since that generally means that some other guy is missing out and is generally pretty angry about things .

   a few alpha males would take most of the young fertile women leaving the majority of the males , the beta males , trying to reproduce with older women or raising someone else 's kids . 
  does n't happen very often in this country, 
  mortgage payments not are tax-deductible for your primary residence ( although its value is often excluded from various welfare calculations so that 's nice ) . 
  there are various government schemes to make primary housing more affordable ; in most cases , this just increased the prices by the exact amount of the scheme . 
  interest payments for investment properties/shares etc * are * tax-deductible , which is probably why lots of people complain ( arguably correctly ) about investment speculators driving up the price of housing . 
  hence pre-nup , and probably some frank discussion about allowances and who should control the finances . 
  there 's also the default 20 days annual leave + 10 days paid sick leave for permanent staff , which is a nice perk . 
  right , but the comment about not saving for retirement because it affects his pension indicates a lack of strategic planning around money , which you may need to help him with .

  walk around your house recording stuff , so if you get stuff stolen you have a record that yes , the tv was fucking huge after allall . 
  google knows the location of public wifi hot spots , it can narrow it down pretty well just from that . 
  i work with a dozen people on that rate , admittedly as contractors rather than permanent staff . 
  150k is about 750 daily rate , which an expert can reasonably be expected to command . 
  i 've seen triple that rate before , but usually on people who were shit hot , or just talked the talk and got canned after a month . 
  all in cash is probably not good at your stage in life .

  i 'd consider keeping your usa assets , and only currency convert your income , then . 
  falling over in the bath actually kills a lot of people . 
  then again , so do car accidents and we 're not paralysed by that fear . 
  do n't forget that pipe also has interactions with magical self-damage , so a centaur or pudge might build a pipe in a game that other heroes might consider it to be too marginal . 
  and way smarter than sheep . 
  many farmers mix in a goat or two into a herd , since goats are smart enough to head towards a ringing bell for feeding time , or get out of the rain when it 's wet . 
  then , the rest of the sheep follow like , well , sheep . 
  and blackberry bushes . 
  i 'd prefer to see mika as the front man .

  there is no device big enough to measure your optimism . 
  this week i learned that blink initiating on a radiance alchemist is really hard and going shadow blade would probably have been a better choice . 
  yes that 's correct . 
  all i know is the market endpoint, 
  real x is jon hallur ? 
  does the sheet also compare the wholesale funds ? 
  op has 90k so it 's close to where the wholesale fund becomes an option . 
  til, 
  valkyrie is ue4 , dust is ue3 + purchased addons . 
  and let 's face it , you 're willing to have low salary if you can live in fucking china working for a fucking awesome game company . 
  just remember that the enemy lineup affects things . 
  vs a huskar , a mjolnir is not going to do much ( and your bash procs are magic as well ) , so you might build battlefury and daedalus instead . 
  seems fair . 
  if they can wait until oculus touch arrives , then the hand issue will be fixed .

  even jungling , maxing oo allows you to clear large stacks for comparatively little mana . 
  pta is a decent enough heal at level 1 , but its mana efficiency is pretty low as you put more points in it ( compared to omniknight 's heal , or god forbid , enchantress ) . 
  so , it 's good to heal up while clearing a stack , but it 's a legitimate thing to jungle by relying on moc for 1-stacks and choke point jungling and oo for big stacks .

  etfs and index funds overlap but not 100 % . 
  index funds track indexes which means management fees are low . 
  etfs are funds that have shares you can buy and sell on the stock market instead of only buying or selling units directly from the fund via some kind of form or whatever . 
  that makes it easy to buy and sell without signing forms etc. 
  many index funds are also etfs , but not all , just like not all etfs are index funds . 
  there is a famous collection of index etfs operated by vanguard , so that may be where the confusion lies .
