  you can also message me on reddit if you have any questions . 
  nobody uses boosters as it is . 
  that 's not necessarily bad ; they are an edge but it 's optional . 
  if you added + damage boosters , they would , like faction ammo and rigs , become instantly mandatory for all pvp operations , just to keep up with the other guy . 
  that would have a bad effect . 
  you only need implants for the two relevant attributes of the skills you 're training . 
  that cuts the cost of your clone by -60 mill . 
  or just roll with + 3 implants to save another 20 million isk . 
  but the primary concern should be : do n't implant what you ca n't afford to lose . 
  ps you guys should have stayed in syndicate . 
  being australians and kiwis , we 're not afraid of calling a spade a fucking shovel , you mad cunt . 
   low membership fee, 
  we like to play eve , not babysit teens . 
  we do have an attached cod/bf ( and presumably dust ) gaming clan , so they 're welcome to try their luck there . 
  i 'm [ * well * aware ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/s5ags/lets_share_knowledge_about_boosters/c4b7j1m ) of the effects of boosters . 
  my assertion is that they are rarely used ( especially in large fleets , where the effect of one player gaining a slight edge is minimal ) . 
  the thing you have to remember that people who e.g. 
  pvp in non-terrible-fit hurricanes instead of scrubs in fail drakes are already amongst the top half of the pvp expertise scale . 
  those who have access to boosters and use them are an even smaller percentage again . 
  i bet . 
  you are the 1 % vov, 
  i believe the film you 're looking for is called * kelly 's heroes * . 
  first thing is to issue * all the shares * in your corp to yourself . 
  leave no share unallocated . 
  ok , so you have a non-terrible character , but need to get back into the swing of things ? 
  personally , i 'd try my hand at incursion fleets ( there 's [ guides ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/12/guidebook.html ) available ) , since it 's an opportunity to, 
  * get yourself into the swing of fitting for pvp ( missions are terrible ), 
  * ** get you into fleets with other people ** ( solo eve is terrible ), 
  * get some pretty decent income per hour while you work out your next step, 
  and then i 'd buy fifty tech 1 frigates and join red vs blue for some pvp practice . 
  after that , you will have a better idea what you want to do next . 
  oh , only because if someone gets director roles , they can just take all the unallocated shares from the wallet , gain a controlling interest in the corporation , initiate a takeover vote to become ceo then steal everything ? 
  drop me a line if you 're interested in some mates to roam with in syndicate during autz . 
  looks like you 'll need a [ few more pilots ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/dropbear+preservation+society ) first though . 
  my alliance evolved from a fps [ gaming clan ] ( http://www.soaclan.co.nz/ ) in nz . 
  we have a bunch of competitive gamers itching to try out dust . 
  enjoy +20 % dps during ganks until it wears off . 
  i thought it a bit weird that the main character in v for vendetta wore a richard branson mask though . 
  i think most smaller alliances would take you ( say , in syndicate or venal ) , especially those without massive moon mining isk fountains . 
  after all , you might not be racking up kills but bankrolling other players is always appreciated . 
  good thing it 's impossible to light a cyno and bump you 50km off station with all the ships coming through . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/stop_exploding_you_cowards ) ? 
  i hear they convinced a supercap pilot to buy more deadspace modules with plex so they could get better drops when they [ scammed him ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/kill-of-week-fraud.html ) into jumping into their cyno . 
  gallente ships are built with holoreels , gel-matrix biopaste and exotic dancers . 
  from my experience , the ` return to eve for $ 5 ' deals tend to go out ahead of a major or minor expansion . 
  i believe [ inferno : escalation ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/en/inferno ) is released on the 24th of april so hopefully there will be a tie-in promotion in the next week . 
   is the nsw police force that blind , stupid , or corrupt ?? 
  clearly , there 's a yogurt bubble . 
  if you 're not doing extraction , then you do n't even need the planetology skills . 
  you can run a quite profitable 5-plant processing setup using 256k points in planetary management skills . 
  foods high in msg gives me a headache , so i try to minimise my intake ( although i do miss chicken-flavored chips ), 
  the way i figure it , most stuff high in msg is n't particularly healthy anyway so i do n't feel like i 'm missing out . 
  when i go to a chinese restaurant , i end up getting stuff that is n't on the english menu anyway , so the recipes generally do n't have any msg . 
  i once had a flatmate from singapore who thought it was ` just the way it is , lah ' when she 'd drink a 600ml bottle of chocolate milk then feel unsettled all day . 
  then five years later it started happening to me :( at least by then , lactose-free milk was available in supermarkets so i was n't forced to resort to soy milk . 
  the invisible hand of jita will provide ~,
