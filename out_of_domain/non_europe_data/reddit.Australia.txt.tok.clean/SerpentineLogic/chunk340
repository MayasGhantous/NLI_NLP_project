  steal the goo , then kill . 
  it 's not about the money . 
  it 's about sending a message ( to the kill feed api ), 
   however , as noizygamer pointed out in your post a day or two ago , every ccp employee that was in a leadership position when that slide was approved and presented is gone . 
  derty dans done dirt cheap, 
  bottle is not quite as good on pl since the heal nerf . 
  the brackets have been doing anything * but * creeping in recent years . 
  `` procurer on dscan . 
  probably bait . '', 
  trying to predict what the player i 'm watching will do next . 
  rarely , but it happens . 
  at times where dotes is unplayable , is the net bad for other sites ? 
  sometimes my entire suburb goes on a netflix binge and floods the backhaul of my isp :(, 
  but is it better than aquila + morbid mask + 400 gold towards dominator ? 
  you might like to apply to http://www.internationalhouse.uq.edu.au/, 
  you can look elsewhere as well , but it seems like the obvious thing to do . 
  why not farm in lane ? 
  wow , has it really been that long since the tax brackets increased ? 
  2007 , huh . 
  regardless of the whose-football-code-is-best chest beating , hayne already has lifetime earnings in excess of $ 2m so he does n't * have to * chase big sign-on bonuses ; he can play whatever the hell he wants . 
  that 's the way it should work . 
  `` your nbn is half-arsed shit . '', 
   labor makes it not half-arsed shit, 
  if you only plan to start with one trade , it 's a good idea to spread your risk across many companies at once . 
  that 's why many people on this sub like index funds , since with one share purchase , you get an equal share in the entire asx300 ( or whatever index the fund follows ), 
  volvo pls, 
  yeah sleep apnoea can be a real problem . 
  you just fell into the sarchasm . 
  when you first start a f2p game , you will be matched with people who do n't exactly care about the game or their stats or whatever . 
  it 's just something you 'll have to move past . 
  he did n't pay up . 
  you * could n't * pay up . 
  fair 's fair . 
  yeah , nobody talks about the benefits of teenage meth use . 
  nobody wants to hire a junior dev as a contractor ; the whole point of contracts is to get someone in who knows what they 're doing ( ideally something that your existing devs ca n't or wo n't learn how to ) then get rid of them when no longer needed . 
  on the other hand , once you get over that hump , you can expect to pull in about 50 % more than the full-time equivalent wage , provided you have no slack time between contracts . 
  just avoid the consultancies like peoplebank , where you get paid a salary but get charged out at consultant rates . 
  it 's literally the worst of both worlds . 
  if you get an offer from a name-brand consultancy like deloitte , boston or accenture , then * maybe * it 's worth taking just for the resume boost and the opportunity for international travel , but be prepared to work absolutely fucking ridiculous hours until you eventually wise up and quit . 
  and remember : the half-life of software devs is 15 years , so have an exit plan . 
  awesome !, 
  they 'd use wormholes . 
  content created . 
  there 's a rumour about the cowboys too . 
  rumours are like that . 
  yeah i remember my first job . 
  so much money that i had to put three quarters of it in a different account so i was n't tempted to go nuts and buy a harley or something . 
  op success, 
  perhaps they could move in with joe hockey 's wife .

  phew . 
  i was worried i 'd have to start [ following ice hockey ] ( http://www.foxsports.com.au/us-sports/washington-capitals-coach-barry-trotz-adamant-aussie-nathan-walker-will-play-in-the-nhl/story-e6frf6ju-1227347328328 ) for a while there . 
  what have you found so far ? 
  perhaps it 's opposite day . 
   until nothing 's left of my bod but my clanker . 
  grr socialists, 
  memrise does chinese and japanese , but it 's more like crowdsourced lessons rather than crowdsourced text translation . 
  ok , so you 'll need a stable of a few heroes to learn . 
  you do n't have to learn all of them ( that will come later , if only because you get getting wrecked by hero x so you read up about how they work so you can learn how to counter them ) but it 's a very good idea to have a go-to hero for offlane , mid , safelane , support etc. 
  ok , so one of the easiest support heros is lich . 
  * he has an ability to get mana , which has a side-effect of stopping your creep wave from pushing too far away from your own tower , so it 's doubly effective . 
  * he has a ranged nuke , which is good to zone enemy heroes away from the hero you 're supporting . 
  * he has a buff spell as well , and it can be autocast ( use with care or youll run dry , but it reduces the micro you need ) . 
  * he has a teamfight ultimate ability , so he 's useful there as well . 
  * he 's relatively fast , and when you buy tranquil boots , he 's even faster, 
  * he does n't need much gold to do his thing , so you can afford to buy wards and other consumable without crippling your effectiveness . 
  for offlane heroes , something like ogre magi might be good . 
  for safe lane carry , you might want to try juggernaut . 
  as a bne broncos fan , i 'm not used to my team not reaching the finals , so this has been quite an experience . 
  also , make the rorqual automatically compress any ore in its ore hold . 
  i really do n't have enough popcorn reserves to keep browsing this sub . 
  i assume you 're talking about [ [ jace beleren ] ] . 
  so , what does jace actually do for a utron deck , besides, 
  * be hard to cast, 
  * cause your opponent to draw into threats faster than you can deal with them ? 
  yes ; if there 's one thing that people say about the rorq , is that it has had a disproportionte amount of dev time spent on it / s, 
  the telecommunications industry ombudsman is already a toothless watch dog . 
  just like the dominix killed the vexor . 
  what the hell is wrong with combat abilities on an industrial platform ? 
  it 's not as if it 's going to obsolete dreadnoughts . 
  they 're already sitting in a belt , mining . 
  they 're already sheep , do n't cut the horns off the ram as well . 
  oh , this guy . 
  that seems like a bad thing to do . 
  * your opponent 's creature kill cards just came online , so there goes your virtual card advantage, 
  * you now have to protect a fragile creature for a turn before you get anything, 
  * when he flips , he does n't do very much for your board position for ages , and his second ability is pretty situational , since it 's sorcery speed, 
  what do you actually want from this card ? 
  a win condition ? 
  there are better ones . 
  a ` not die ' card ? 
  there are better ones . 
  no , i do n't see it . 
  so , find an instant-speed dig card ? 
  you 're playing u tron . 
  you * already have * inevitability . 
  you just need to get there .
