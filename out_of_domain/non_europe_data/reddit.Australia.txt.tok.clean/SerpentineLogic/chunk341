  like i said , i do n't see the card making it . 
  reading patch notes . 
  super simple stuff . 
  it 's not the isk per day that they care about , it 's the isk per hour of actual effort involved , which is basically zero , once you know auto hot key . 
  okay scratch that . 
   make it so that the ~ ~ risk ~ ~ reward of hunting rhinos, 
  ftfy, 
  * high-interest savings account is definitely recommended for that much cash . 
  as far as managed funds go , i think most people on this sub are big fans of [ index funds ] ( https://barefootinvestor.com/how-to-invest-guide/index-funds/ ) as the core of an investment strategy . 
  as far as which index funds get into , generally a mix of domestic and international indexes spreads your risk the most . 
  [ john bogle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_c._bogle ) created a famous index fund company in the 1970s called vanguard , which is a name you 'll often see on this sub , but there are legitimate competitors in the market . 
  fuck , has nobody heard of 3d printers ? 
  [ these things ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/market.php?group_id=1865 ) do not look like celestials ? 
  reddit not so much , but forums and , especially news sites ? 
  fuck yes . 
  basically , any site where being the first post is important will have a lot of shills camping the newsfeed trying to get their talking points on the front page of comments . 
  [ thanks for sharing , but now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d0xku2d.jpg ), 
   no one wants a cfc/imperium book . 
  it 's uninteresting, 
  for $ 150 000 , i think i could force myself to write an uninteresting book that no one wants . 
  what types ? 
  for once i 'm ahead of the meta, 
  inspector is hoping buyer will force seller into making repairs , which makes him and his mates rich . 
  i 'd probably pump more into vgb and vgs until the ratios are more like 30/35/35 , in the hope that those markets are up when i decide to buy a house ( ca n't guarantee that vas will be strong if the housing market goes tits up ), 
  a buddy movie , like max max ? 
  / u/chribbax is the most reputable , but not the cheapest , probably because he 's pretty busy already . 
  everyone else is cheaper and less reputable . 
  it kinda goes hand in hand . 
  thragtusks are a cheap alternative . 
  settle down , mary poppins . 
  it 's a pendulum ; it 's a sliding scale . 
  it 's a * spectrum * , if you will . 
  that 's black humour . 
  so i guess you know how australians feel about people writing stuff upside down . 
  black irish . 
  eight hundred bucks gets you a mid range magic the gathering deck .

  at least you 're five cards closer to land . 
  are you affiliated with [ this guy ] ( https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/architectural-visualisation-gaming-engines-unreal-49-vr-ky-lane ) ? 
  i would pay money to read about the fall of the northern coalition , since imo it 's a much better * actual story * than fountain war . 
  step 1 : identify your weakness , since you obviously do n't have the same weaknesses of a normal 500 mmr player ( inability to last hit being the most common ), 
  how you fix that is highly dependent on step 1 , but probably involves playing a game , then rewatching the game looking for mistakes you made against that thing you 're trying to improve , rinse , repeat . 
  if you then leave your job , you have to give it back . 
  that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  yeah , this lines up with what / u/umnumun said about role bonuses not being applied before fitting . 
  does the loan have an offset account ? 
  wow , that 's unexpectedly good . 
  now i really want to know who r ** is . 
  go for it . 
  it might not be his solar system that caused the dilation , since each server hosts multiple systems and a fleet engagement in one system may accrue collateral lag . 
  that 's correct . 
  what 's amusing is that time dilation means that late participants can get into a fight that would have been concluded if there were no dilation , so you often see replacement fleets form up to get their slice of the action , even an hour or two after the fight started . 
  i 'm pretty sure / u/new _ eden_link_bot is the actual non-scammer who sends the invite link . 
  i tend only to hang out with it consultancies and agencies rather than general ones . 
  well , since he 's from the us , attempting to get welfare in australia would probably be less than successful . 
  the bot only triggers on certain words . 
  in this case , it did n't work .

  is the link from / u/new _ eden_link_bot ? 
  if not , it 's a scam . 
  exploration is good . 
  each day , you undock and see what exploration sites are available . 
  if you find something , good . 
  if not , dock up and try again tomorrow . 
  there 's also trade and industry , since jobs and trades happen even when you 're not logged in . 
  all exploration content is on a timer . 
  normally , a site will last a bit less than a week if nobody scans it down . 
  when someone warps to the site , it starts a shorter timer . 
  wormholes will disappear within 24 hours or so , other sites are different and may disappear as soon as you warp out again , or as soon as you try to hack a container or whatever . 
  either way if you scan and warp to all the sites in the surrounding couple solar systems , they 'll probably be new by the same time tomorrow . 
  if you 're interested in exploration stuff , there 's a [ corp that does that ] ( https://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/ ) . 
  you might pick up some tips . 
  the popcorn is real ^ ^ ^ ^ nice, 
  did you forget about sri lanka ? 
  you have been banned from / r/cricket, 
  we 're just saying we see a lot of sharmas and basus , that 's all .

  plays eve, 
  makes jokes about moderating being a job, 
  is fattyboi, 
  can always take some extra subjects , or splash marketing as electives . 
  diffusal blade makes him unhappy , too . 
  ah then you want http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2030286.the_ice_is_coming, 
  in general , people stop bring racist when they actually get to know you . 
  i think this is true of all stereotypes . 
  it 's allegedly a non contact sport . 
  we usually reserve the best political barbs for the opposition party . 
  the collected insults of prime minister keating are legendary . 
  yes . 
  brothels too . 
  i do n't think street prostitution or call girls are legal though . 
  in essence , you go to the girls , they do not go to you . 
  it 's a safety thing .
