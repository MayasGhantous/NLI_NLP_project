  i understand that single-player campaigns take a lot of time and resources to make ( cough half-life ) , but i was really hoping for a single player campaign ala x-wing . 
  enjoy your water sports . 
  i 'm 100 % out of fmg , but it was the last one i jettisoned . 
  sadly work prevents edu . 
  on the other hand , the overtime it forces me to do means i 'll have a decent pc when the rift launches . 
  you and me both :(, 
  it 's cool , everyone knows goons are a cia front . 
  a year . 
  at least fmg has income and relatively low cost base compared to ridiculous outfits like atlas . 
  ccp made them redundant when station queues were removed . 
  if they want to make it worth setting up a research tower or citadel , they need to make station research a lot slower than it is now . 
  his alliance is n't big enough . 
  sounds like / r/gunjack, 
  you need a ccp riser . 
  karn is a good card but a bad clock . 
  it gives you control of a game , but that should not be a problem in u tron . 
  coil is better for stabilising against its bad match ups . 
  til raphael was a canvass-sniper . 
  wow that 's in great condition . 
  the card is worth $ 10,000 usd , pricing is the least of your worries, 
  ps insure that thing right now, 
  i 've had halal snags . 
  they 're awesome . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i 'll pay 7.99 %, 
  i found the dialog terrible , and the artwork increasingly bad . 
  watch out boys , we got a sharpie here . 
  but not guaranteed . 
  mateship . 
  i have no dog in this fight , but i 'll have a go at it . 
  some of these fears are dependent on exactly what circumstances euthanasia is legal , btw . 
  * fears that people will feel pressured to die so as ` not to be a burden ', 
  * fears that people will pressure relatives to die so they can inherit, 
  * fears that old people will feel pressured because all their friends are doing it ( just like publicising famous suicides tends to bring a rash of other people committing suicide soon after ), 
  * fears that society will start going ` fuck spending money on keeping old people alive , they should be offing themselves anyway ', 
  * fears that people will ` give up too early ' or whatever . 
  basically , http://www.euthanasia.com/argumentsagainsteuthanasia.html, 
  you sound like a child whining because your dad has said to play nice or he 'll take away your toy . 
  your options are, 
  * do what he says , or, 
  * leave home , or, 
  * have sex with your mom . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure , but i think that 's how it works . 
  amarica victor, 
  kotaku australia is fine . 
  the american sites is the worst . 
  he 's being down voted because that 's literally all he has been posting for the last week . 
  is this the first time we 've heard about the price ? 
  soviet goonion : the putin era . 
  every time i see the words ` fountain war ' , i think ' [ active wear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyrenwt8lz8 ) ', 
  confirming secret chinese menu at the places my parents-in-law go to . 
   the subset of this we have in the us ( both what originally influenced american-chinese and the ` authentic ' chinese here ) only represents the styles of populations who had immigrated to the us early on . 
  to be fair , of the nine ? 
  schools of chinese cooking , seven of them are in southern china , where most 19th-century chinese immigrants came from . 
  * no link to the official forum where you have detailed your idea to ccp . 
  no effort -  no upvotes, 
  also, 
  * writable mailing lists -  evemail spam bots . 
  why do you hate eve ? 
   and after all of that , they are `` sick of the lazy moochers '' who are abusing the system , and they hate president obama for ... reasons they ca n't articulate beyond , `` he 's ruining our country . '', 
  there 's a case to be made that * your in-laws * are ruining the country . 
  you 're probably better off sorting all your cards by the set number , then looking up the expensive cards in each set online ( e.g. 
  [ here ] ( http://sales.starcitygames.com//spoiler/display.php?&amp;s%5b5172%5d=5172&amp;foil=nofoil&amp;for=no&amp;crittermatch=or&amp;r_all=all&amp;t_all=all&amp;g_all=all&amp;sort1=11&amp;numpage=25&amp;display=3&amp;startnum=425 ) ) . 
  last i saw them they were in syndicate . 
  i guess that 's pretty close by . 
  early sets did not have colour coded rarity symbols , btw . 
  oh wow i just realised i have some signed revised duals somewhere . 
  now i have to rummage through boxes ... 
  one for each flag, 
  why would they debate a question with only one answer ? 
  do n't ask me ; i have low standards . 
  on the other hand , i spend my life surrounded by incredibly beautiful women , so there 's that . 
  edit : amazing how much whoosh there is here . 
  even so , your job has now turned into a shit job , so you ca n't really stay . 
  once upon a time , a procurer cost about 1m isk to make . 
  i made a thousand or so before the material cost change . 
  they 're now ~ 20m ( although it took a long time , so i took some profits at 8m ), 
  even if they ca n't do it server-side , but tell your eve client to do it from your end , it would be nice . 
  yeah , i can see how that could be seen as insensitive , just like ` one nation , under god ' really annoys non-christian americans . 
  on the other hand , maybe the muslim chaplains could get a crescent with the same motto , and the rabbis could get a star of david with the same motto . 
  personally , i 'm in favour of a rosarius , but * only * while the chaplain has the correct purity seals on his power armour . 
  * snipe courier , hopefully this wins mid for your team . 
  * place wards in their jungle, 
  * rotate lanes to gank as well as when they drop sentries . 
  this keeps them guessing and wastes the ward . 
  * smoke bomb is really good , and keeps you alive . 
  * s & y , diffusal are good . 
  sometimes basher . 
  so , trams . 
  assuming you are already meeting the minimum repayments , i guess whichever has the highest interest rate . 
  note that if you plan to switch cards to get 6 months interest free , then that affects the effective interest rate ... 
  no but he gets a * lot * of pics of indian cars . 
  yeah , it 's super important to be consistent with your items , so when you finally do get muscle memory you 'll benefit from it . 
  * magic stick/mek/ghost scepter/defensive shadowblade all go in the same ` panic ! ', 
  item slot, 
  * atos/dagon/blink / orchid etc go in the same ` quickcast attack ' slot . 
  * teleport scroll always goes in the same slot, 
  * boots always go in the same slot ( except teleport boots , which go in the teleport slot ), 
   hero choice is not what holding you back . 
   every aspect of your play is holding you back .
