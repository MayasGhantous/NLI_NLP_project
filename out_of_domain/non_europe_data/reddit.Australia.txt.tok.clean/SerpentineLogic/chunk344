  confirming . 
  i looked at a property in a mining town a couple years back . 
  it was being rented for $ 90k/year , but of course the asking price was commensurably high . 
  i checked just now , and the last sale in that area was $ 450k , which seems to be about reasonable ( there might be variable demand for regular joes in that town , but there 's only so many decent houses for foremen and managers ), 
  looks like inflation is ~ 1.5 % , so getting double that return is n't too hard . 
   there is actually an incredibly high number of rapes - and the military does n't want to acknowledge it . 
  it looks bad . 
  and yet , [ in australia ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaqpoevgr8u ), 
  a few days ago i played with a wd whose item progression was, 
  * robes of the magi, 
  * oblivion staff, 
  and did n't skill his ult until we badgered him to at level 10 . 
  i 'm not saying the rest of us were 1000mmr higher than him , but we at least * tried * . 
  ... and your bottle fills up , 
  does the card have a yearly cost ? 
  i think lowsec residents are considerably more likely to say ` fuck you , fuck your chicken and and fuck your viceroy ' than bend the knee , comparatively speaking . 
  play the hero that will demoralise the enemy team the most . 
  from what i have seen of that server , team morale is very fragile . 
  i have n't played enough games to calibrate ... 
  uh , that 's why the yellow line tracks the rulings of the middle judge . 
  well , you can use , poli pay . 
  you know , the one that screen scrapes your internet banking passwords . 
  not suss . 
  the domestic market as a whole is bank-heavy anyway ; it 's not like op is bucking the trend . 
  i believe the standard procedure is to tell one other person who has not sworn to confidentiality , then act shocked when it gets posted to reddit . 
  yes , three dudes would make this plan airtight . 
  yes , those awkward [ question hugs ] ( http://reactiongif.org/wp-content/uploads/gif/2014/08/gif-austin-powers-come-here-cry-crying-dr.-evil-hug-hug-it-out-sad-gif.gif ) ... 
  `` we instigate , you decide '', 
  and the guy is working on other , related vaccines . 
  i guess he just really fucking hates warts . 
   susan did n't invent the goddamned ribbon, 
  she died in 1980 ; so it 's incredibly unlikely that she had any influence over the foundation by the time gulf war 1 started . 
  at low levels , they kinda do . 
  in a boyish way . 
  the naga is also in there . 
  it was the yacht . 
  to be fair , that 's not an uncommon thing . 
  i guess you could get a loan using the business as partial collateral , but you 'll need more collateral to bring the lvr down . 
  can this line of questioning * be * more rhetorical ? 
  well , vgs has 0.18 % management fees , while veu has 0.14 % and vts is 0.05 % . 
  so 50/50 split of veu and vts is about half the management fees ( with the converse that you then have to pay twice as much brokerage each time you invest ), 
  they have skilled up heavy narrative operation v. 
  well , it was the olden days . 
  remember that you can also invest in the vanguard managed funds . 
  the management fees may be higher than some etfs , but they 're definitely a lot more convenient to invest into , since they take bpay . 
  to be fair , he arrived at the pub wednesday night . 
  ca n't be worse than * the burning life * . 
  fozzie is super diplomatic though , and that counts for something . 
  you know that in the same situation , grey scale would have said something inflammatory sooner or later . 
  agreed . 
  it 's often the people underneath the leader that fuck things up . 
  faces . 
  if i were you , i 'd take a trip to india to check the situation out . 
  my favourite charity is opportunity international . 
  perhaps it 'll appeal to you . 
  my employer gives on my behalf . 
  apparently i lift 30 families out of poverty for each year i work there . 
  water boils at 100 c and yet it still evaporates . 
  white blood cell 1 : fuck me , where are those terrorist viruses hiding ? 
  we ca n't see the fuckers anywhere in the bloodstream . 
  fucking cowards . 
  and we ca n't look inside the cells because of fucking civil liberties . 
  white blood cell 2 : ok ok ok get this . 
  we do n't go chasing the viruses ... 
  white blood cell 1 : yeah ? 
  what do we follow then ? 
  white blood cell 2 : we follow the shipments of brake fluid and fertiliser . 
  white blood cell 1 : that 's fuckin genius mate . 
  that 's a given . 
  i 'm tagging you as ` choked on a dick ', 
  and if you do n't have one , you 're fucked anyway . 
  or maybe he 'll put all his other accounts in rorquals too . 
  do n't assume . 
  when is fawlty 's * actual * birthday ? 
  istr that valkyrie works on some note4s and not others , depending on whether it 's the innovator edition ( which i think does n't work ) or international edition . 
  vhy not ? 
  although , driver less trains are a thing . 
  train drivers in the pilbara are on 150 to 180k . 
  does s&y slow interact well with silver edge ? 
  even the full amount is only a couple of months profit . 
  so , high mechanical skill but often reported for communication abuse ? 
  yes , he 's quite the larrikin . 
  heroes that are played in multiple lanes have multiple guides . 
  i like [ chinatown dental ] ( https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/chinatown+dental+surgery+-+dr.+chan+kendrick+%26+dr+eva+kung/@-27.4580647,153.0330969,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b9159f3da8d7b49:0xa4cac461dbb05e13 ) ( bottom of chinatown mall ), 
  i do n't know , sorry . 
  craft burgers do okay in australia . 
  anecdotally though , chain fast food in australia is just better than the same chain in the us . 
  perhaps it 's a morale effect due to the higher minimum wage down under . 
  you 're allowed to post like an asshole . 
  other people are allowed to treat you as an asshole . 
  so when you post , ask yourself `` do i want to make a point , or do i just want to appear like an asshole ? '', 
  amd cards are a lot better in direct x 12 . 
  they plan to expand the use of the northwest shelf gas reserves . 
  and they plan to export a lot of juice . 
  fuck you i just donated two hundred bucks to a library . 
  not even joking . 
  perhaps he just has n't ... 
  * swung by querious * yet . 
  because super was set up to be in addition to the pension , not to replace it wholesale .
