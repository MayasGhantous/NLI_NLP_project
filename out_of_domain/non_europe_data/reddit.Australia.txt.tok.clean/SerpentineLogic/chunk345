  100k/jump is picked up if it fits in a blockade runner . 
  nostalgia 's wrecking shot , ouch . 
  because you do it in twenty systems , while you 're not even at the keyboard . 
  yeah but dan abnett can actually write . 
  it 's the edison way . 
  at this rate you 'll need power of attorney to limit his screw ups . 
  sometimes i think the bar is n't set very high right now . 
  in before pos bowling, 
  ps : let your dreams be jim beams . 
  step 1 : reach the average, 
  step 2 : exceed the average, 
  and often has . 
  how about [ [ aurochs herd ] ] or [ [ maul splicer ] ] or the simple choice of turn 3 [ [ hexplate golem ] ] ? 
  if you do n't run the splicer then obviously you 'd use [ [ ruin processor ] ] instead of the golem . 
  basically the idea is to leverage the turn 3 seven drop . 
  i have played eve on a connection worse than 56k modem . 
  like , literally so bad that i could not get dial tone but could still eke enough connectivity to play . 
  well , it was n't exactly by choice . 
  for instance , they hold 50 % of the world strategic reserve of clegane . 
  do n't forget the country 's third-largest export industry : [ internet spaceships ] ( http://www.eveonline.com ) . 
  apparently they have stockpiled [ entire mountains ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/351p0y/akat_mountain/ ) . 
  how appropriate , since we specifically do n't give financial advice . 
   proust quote, 
  okay , thread 's over ; pack it in boys . 
  well if you cut a fruit open , the insides really * look and feel * like chocolate pudding ( its texture is a lot like soft fudge ) . 
  as far as the taste , it 's fairly bland like avocado ( but tastes slightly fruity like a nashi rather than , e.g. 
  avocado-tasting ), 
  one of the cool things about the fruit is that they will happily sit on the tree for 5-6 months in a fully-grown but rock-hard state until you pick them , then they ripen in 24 hours and if you do n't eat them they turn into mush the day after that . 
  source : have a tree at home . 
  if it 's not ripe , it 's clearly inedible . 
  it 's like trying to eat raw pumpkin . 
  remember to activate your charon . 
  `` not memeing hard enough '', 
  if you go with the ruin processor plan , 1-2 maindeck [ [ relic of progenitus ] ] will help it trigger . 
  probably replace some prisms with the relics . 
  i doubt 4 prisms are necessary . 
  a towering pillar of hat ? 
  why do you have only 3 ancient stirrings yet 4 prophetic prisms ? 
  also , considered [ [ seek the wilds ] ] instead of the prisms ? 
  that 's vaguely in line with my calculations . 
  well , it 's his job i guess . 
  incidentally , what do you do if the combo fails ? 
  30 days, 
  it 's not exactly a bad thing , though , right ? 
  i mean , i 'd hate to play an actual game of american football , but watching it is okay . 
   subject alliances are expected to fork over fresh memes ** and a percentage of their reddit karma ** . 
  you fucking * monsters *, 
  wait , unless you accept comment karma , in which case we coo . 
  `` grand moff diving '', 
  max locked targets = 2, 
  `` viceroy city '', 
  spirit breaker is a better counter outside of dance though . 
  bsj explains it best . 
  let 's just bring back / u/aradon and call the experiment an unqualified failure . 
   `` i never made a mistake in my life ; at least , never one that i could n't explain away afterwards . '', 
  -- rudyard kipling , notable danegeld expert . 
  and slack . 
  or maybe that 's another persona . 
  a lot of the eve chronicles fiction is top-notch ; maybe tap one of * them * on the shoulder and ask them to write a book . 
  `` i 'm sorry ... that you think that way . '', 
  templar one was better . 
  no , he means once he leaves , nobody will be checking out op 's buttocks any more . 
  depends how much trouble retro fitting a battery would be . 
  probably best to plan ahead and leave some space on the carport wall or whatever . 
  yeah , probably the best place to get installer reviews and advice . 
  personally , i would n't wait . 
  could probably write a small script to go to https://steamdb.info/graph/ get a list of app ids , then go to https://steamdb.info/app/ { appid } / config / and grab the executable column . 
  probably the best idea would be to add official steam integration though . 
  it 's not * quite * so black and white as that , but if i had to choose which side to fight for , it would be the kurds . 
  i would say that 75 % of everyone who has ever knocked on my door has been dodgy ( solar , electricity-provider switchers , etc ), 
  the rest have been tree loppers that i said no to , so i ca n't tell since i did n't bother researching them enough . 
  you may find that solar is a good idea , but that sunsource is not the best company to install it for you ... 
  that 's common amongst bilingual children . 
  after all , sign language * is * another language . 
  they still have this ; it 's called soundcloud . 
  yes there has been word . 
  username checks out . 
  `` it is with great reluctance that i accept the position of chancellor of the republic '', 
  a tattoo like that would be an impedance to his career , true . 
  well , ask your boss when he thinks you 'll be hiring . 
  it still got a lot of up volts . 
  the meta data centre . 
  i 've been posting for years and even i have n't gone infinite . 
  at * best * , i get a few months of gold per year . 
  i 'll be charitable and assume you 're trolling instead of being an imbecile . 
  um , you know the nbn bought that back from telstra recently ? 
  you 're the ceo right ? 
  so , are you using an * actual * corp auth tool like [ allianceauth ] ( https://allianceauth.com/ ) ? 
  i would seriously consider taking up magic the gathering over bridge . 
  jack knife is fine if you want to check out a recruit , but you really want something automated to remove access if they leave corp or remove their api key or whatever . 
  yeah , i think there 's an open source version you can set up yourself ? 
  either way , would be nice to have that sort of thing in eve seat . 
  i think / u/adarnof maintains it , amongst others . 
  the only reason that cantonese and mandarin are called dialects instead of separate languages is politics . 
  if cantonese speakers had their own ~ ~ country ~ ~ [ military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy ) , the situation would be entirely different . 
  argyle is very good about the money it distributes locally . 
  other mining companies , not so much . 
   or install a pully ** and wench ** to lift you out, 
  sadly appropriate . 
  do you set up your super allocation by percent ( x % cash , y % australian shares etc etc ) then the fund should automatically rebalance when you add money , give or take .
