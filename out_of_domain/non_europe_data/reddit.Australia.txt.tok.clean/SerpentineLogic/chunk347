  like i said , i do n't do individual stocks any more . 
  index funds follow entire stock market indices rather than trying to predict which are good stocks and which are n't . 
  etfs are funds that you can buy or sell like shares instead of sending them forms and applying that way . 
  so , not all index funds are etfs , and not all etfs ate index funds , but lots are . 
  well , there 's your problem - too many factories , too far away from silos , and you do n't chain routes from outer factories through closer buildings to save grid ( at the expense of bandwidth ), 
  [ this ] ( https://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pi_factories.png ) is the kind of efficient setup you need . 
  not even that . 
  just make p1 at those four planets , then go from p1 to p3 in the last one . 
  ok , but what about the funds that span multiple etfs ? 
  \\ #whatcouldpossiblygowrong, 
  you can auto attack , or just kill the ranged creep when the lane is close to your tower , or you can wait for them to over extend then kill them . 
  jungle tier . 
  not everyone is up with the 4/2/1 / 1 skill build . 
  i see so many 0/4/4 / 0 it 's not funny . 
  and then i lose . 
  i love that band . 
  some brokers like options xpress have a ' [ virtual trading ] ( http://www.optionsxpress.com.au/tools_research/virtual_trade.aspx ) ' thing where you get some fake money and make fake trades and it tracks your fake earnings . 
  `` i 'm so smart ; look at all the money i make . 
  surely i 'm smarter than a doctor who is obviously not as rich as me '', 
  yes please , provide proof . 
  how did you find isk sellers ? 
  how did you find buyers ? 
   * just * doxxes people, 
  well there 's already an unfilled niche for ` octopus that can breed more than once '' . 
  is eve doing some sort of background resource loading ? 
  spam accounts often delete themselves . 
  the flashback will kill spellskites though . 
  there is something that , simplified , * might * be called ` nerve pain ' as opposed to ` muscle pain ' , but it 's pretty niche . 
  from what i understand , when you stretch ( touching your toes etc ) , there 's one kind of pain that comes from nerve bundles moving inside the nerve sheathes , and occasionally finding rough spots that cause pretty sharp pain . 
  this is called nerve mobility and is generally the first thing that you encounter when you start to stretch - it 's not usually the muscles that stop you at first . 
  i guess the other type of nerve pain is like , pinched nerves ? 
  you do n't * need * to flash it back for it to be good . 
  even if it just were an instant-speed pyroclasm that dodges prot-red and can be found with stirrings , it would still see play . 
  [ [ anger of the gods ] ] is ( 1 ) ( r ) ( r ) though . 
  2 flashbacks ( or 1 cast + 1 flashback ) will kill the wurms , but you 'd need another flashback to kill the tokens . 
  whatever jaden 's shortcomings , you ca n't argue that will has n't tried his * hardest * to help him start a movie career . 
  oh fuck i have friends in the bastion do n't make me join you guys . 
  ancient stirrings means you 'll see it about 18 % more often than otherwise . 
  the point is to * get to * the point where yo 're outdamaging people . 
  ( note that you might not be outdamaging the enemy carry for a long time ), 
  well , when you have something to replace it i guess ? 
  i find that slark needs just a bit of help with stats to survive long enough for his agility stacks to tick up enough for a kill . 
  so , i often buy a casual bracer ( or occasionally drums ) . 
  i also like the s&y plan before shadow blade , ( or at least s ) just to provide a bit more hp buffer , since sb gives zero stats . 
  learn to pull through instead of stack and pull . 
  it 's more than twice the xp gain per minute , or at least you 're away from your carry for less time . 
  watch purges coaching session of a crystal maiden for more info about pull through . 
  it 's something that is easy to practice in a lobby , so you should take the opportunity . 
  if you are having that hard a lane , you can pull from the medium and hard camps near the t2 and t3 . 
  however , it 's worth trying the pull through at least once . 
  lance -  disassemble for bkb + butterfly, 
  no but it means you have to orb walk to get the full bonus, 
  that 's an ambiguous question . 
  * pc but not through the oculus store : definitely not happening, 
  * pc but not with a vr headset : definitely not happening, 
  * pc but not with the rift : probably not happening, 
  you probably would be better posting this to / r/auslaw . 
   and then have a fucking dota match to decide who won . 
  sure why not . 
  as opposed to here , where actual lawyers are dispensing legal advice willy-nilly . 
  okay . 
  hi / u/missingbrain . 
  if you have any questions about eve , feel free to message me !, 
  easier to calculate how much compressed ore you need to build a capital ship .

   significant experience of delivering excellent business results games and in an ongoing ` product as a service ' model, 
  hmm . 
  subscription mmos are paas , where console games are not . 
  hey , no problem . 
  if you want , feel free to message me your in-game name and i can contract you some stuff relevant to your newbie interests . 
  so , they are legal , but must do the compliance of normal hire cars . 
  seems fair , and is a definite option for full-time drivers . 
  leaves the normal ad-hoc ride sharing in a grey area , but this decision carves a sensible middle ground for ` not an actual taxi , but am doing business driving people around ' kind of people . 
  you splinter twinned a sundering titan ? 
  you * monster * . 
  good question . 
  maybe they are , if you look at existing platforms like heroku and xero as examples ; just because some people do n't pay does n't mean you 're not providing an ongoing service . 
  maybe the real distinction is that paas does n't have ` version 2 ' that invalidates the old version , like madden or cod . 
  you have a high win rate . 
  just keep playing . 
  is that 50 for the tier 2 camp ? 
  if you pull from the radiant hard camps it 's 55 ( or 50 if you cut the tree in the corner ) cutting the tree is safer . 
  just be careful because you can easily lose the ranged creep to the radiant lane creeps . 
  i guess that 's a cool birthday present . 
  ... lift at [ granite peak ski area ] ( http://www.skicentral.com/granitepeak.html ) in wisconsin ?

  vanguard is slightly better against him . 
  this year 's christmas present is `` one not-kick-in-the-ass '', 
  well , csiro made a fair bit of money from its wifi patent . 
  uwa has commercialised its [ thing ] ( http://www.hazergroup.com.au/about/company-overview/ ) . 
  so it 's possible to make money in australia . 
  skadi is still a uam ; it just happens to allow lifesteal . 
  is the account in your name ? 
  when you turn 18 , most banks will turn your kid saver style account into a real deposit account , and deauthorise your parents . 
  well , if you 're not earning much then sure , but if you get into higher tax brackets it might not be so straight-forward . 
  definitely . 
  or give them a call . 
  you have to expect legal action to enforce that kind of stuff - in fact , the more useful the patent is , the more tempting it is to get around it . 
  arcane boots provide mana .
