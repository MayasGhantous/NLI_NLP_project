  lens does not . 
  keep boots until your mana regeneration is enough that you do n't need the boots any more . 
  source ? 
  orb of venom is now applied by illusions , too , so you can still chase someone down even if your real ck is out of the fight . 
  ah , * there 's * the version i want . 
  i knew dark horse would come through with a trade version . 
  like 40 and 8 ? 
  but you have the ability to affect that . 
  a few 2 star ratings and he will * have to * sit up and take notice . 
  and yet , knowing all that , i * still * prefer uber to taxis . 
  that 's how shit they are . 
   is huskar dumpstered now or is he still viable at lower mmrs, 
  define low . 
  at a certain point i 'm pretty sure anything is viable . 
  tried lance on huskar ? 
  i wonder how hood active interacts with magic resist - does huskar get extra value from it , or does it just soak raw damage and ignore resists ? 
  also winter is when you get all your work done in iceland . 
  summer is for vacation , winter is for darkness and toil . 
  lc can use armlet but you do n't keep it forever - it gets you duel wins so you can transition into other items . 
  it 's really hard to compete with eye , though . 
  i like boots straight into blink ( 9 minutes ) because frankly , i 'm bad at farming and the build up to blink is rough . 
  yeah , definitely . 
  usually i 'm on the back foot so it 's blink , blade mail etc. 
  if you 're doing well , s&y is a good pick up . 
  it really extends the move speed difference when you 're chasing . 
  [ instructions unclear ] ( http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0224/5205/products/elleorangecollection_5bfd589f-35db-4a14-a2e3-26075e322f78_1024x1024.jpg ), 
  i unironically went jungle last time i played lc . 
  9 minute blink and boots is a lot faster than offlane where i usually play her . 
  i think all my autz friends who still play dust are in warravens . 
  link ? 
  perhaps try quick casting . 
  not as good as shift queue but still faster than w click . 
  that 's true , but that 's only 2 skill points difference from the 1-1-3 jungle build - fairly easy to recover from . 
   it 's about her personal drive , ambition and ability rather than her genitals . 
  as it should be . 
  as a newbie to dota , i find it okay . 
  there 's a bit of trash talking but since you can only hear your own team over voice chat , you skip the ` lol get rekt scrub i fucked your mum ' crowing when you get killed . 
  also , it 's super-easy to mute people on your own team , and/or report them for communication abuse . 
  retail funds directly owning property ? 
  possible but unlikely - it 's a lot of hassle and outside their core business ( which is managing super portfolios rather than being building superintendents ), 
  retail funds investing in the property * market * ? 
  sure . 
  smsf directly owning a property ? 
  sure , although the ato has many hurdles for you to jump which probably make it not worth it . 
  released in may i think , so it will be close . 
  would you accept ` junta ' ? 
  perhaps more likely is to know how primed you are before you decide to engage . 
  i 'm not sure whether that 's a good measure , since cans of coke are probably tied relatively strongly to the us dollar . 
  having said that , usd20 is about 18 cans in australia ( ~ $ 1.50 each in a cheap eatery ), 
  because you do n't understand the concept of [ purchasing power parity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) and we do ? 
  would you prefer [ big macs ] ( http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index ) or [ ipods ] ( https://www.commsec.com.au/content/dam/en/researchnews/eco_insights_0709.pdf ) ? 
  user name checks out . 
   on one hand , sure . 
  well done . 
  [ i remember . 
  ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/gough_whitlam#iremember ), 
  shoebox . 
  so , you make a macro that meant you could press ' 1 1 1 1 ' and get coldsnap ... 
  if someone 's resume was dropped on my desk , i 'd completely disregard any qualifications from qantm , evocca etc. 
  they 're a step below tafe in my eyes . 
  a [ friend of mine ] ( http://suitventure.com/ ) just moved to ireland , so yeah it happens . 
  the domestic component of veu may be enough , initially . 
  probably need more info about this hypothetical person . 
  the difference is probably not worth worrying about at this point . 
  perhaps when you get to 50k , you might have enough room for 5k of vas , but imo it 's not really worth buying something that would be < 10 % of your portfolio until you get into 6 figures invested . 
  sliced bread is 1930s-era tech , so yeah , it probably does have a place . 
  yeah well we 're going dietary fibre to the nose , * so there * . 
  * especially * after pl gets diffusal blade . 
  it 's too late , just like it 's too late to get into chess . 
  this thread went tangential in a hurry . 
  roughly translated :, 
  * ` benedict aaron thorolf-son ', 
  * ` thorolf beck christian-son ', 
  ccp guard does n't need security ; he needs a step ladder . 
  so , like 6.9 % gross . 
  i have played eve on a modem-speed internet connection . 
  network latency obviously makes pvp more risky , but eve is not a twitch game so you should be relatively ok . 
  courthouse of course . 
  pretty sure it was started under labor . 
  typical coal fired generators last ~ 40 years , and maintenance starts getting stupidly expensive after 30 , because expensive things start breaking . 
  in fact , iceland went to war over cod . 
  did you not read the [ latest chronicle ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/ ) ? 
  most people just use http://eve-industry.org/calc/ or download eveiskperhour . 
  so , stay in wormhole space and nobody will even know you 're logged in until you drop in and say hi with some torpedoes . 
  whoah , if you ca n't trust the chief ~ ~ propagandist ~ ~ diplomat of the clusterfuck coalition , then who * can * you trust ? 
  gevlon from wow plays eve now . 
  he loves the trading side of it , and he 's quite rich ( like , he could prepay his subscription for the next few decades from his current in game wallet ), 
  dr ` bloody ' boon, 
  flying carrots . 
  current . 
   expect plenty of pm 's . 
  just like the australian parliament then . 
   ~ ~ employers ~ ~ people are usually utter cunts , somehow people seem to think otherwise . 
  ftfy, 
  bake it off, 
  i have n't upgraded to the latest osx patch , but i do n't experience the issues you mentioned . 
  but seriously , disable eve voice , it makes the mac client less stable . 
  are n't there aurum tokens you can buy on the market ? 
  idgi, 
  even lc , the quintessential ` why are you jungling ' hero , can take on a medium or hard camp at level 1 with tangos and a talon , and can be self sustainable by the time the tangos are used up .
