  we stopped having a darwinian society once man invented the crutch . 
  i was there when the dean held up a prototype as part of his ` welcome to uq engineering ' talk during orientation week , stressing the thousands of dollars of research and engineering done to manufacture it . 
  he then proceeded to put it on a nearby table where it rolled off , bending the tip and making it worthless . 
  not so useful , since he already has a character . 
  why would anyone go to sleep wearing their pet 's shoes ? 
  be honest . 
  is n't the adrenaline rush the reason you 're still playing ? 
  yeah i have tablets . 
  they work out at 50c each , if you buy from a pharmacy . 
  as someone who is of chinese descent , i beg to differ . 
  forever ? 
  unlikely . 
  there 's a distinct difference between the naturally occurring levels in soy and the amount on a flavor enhanced chicken flavored crisp . 
  then we are at an impasse . 
  the koreans have this snack which is basically oily dried seaweed wafers . 
  i so nice , so much umami . 
  i love it but it gives me a headache when i eat them . 
  not the msg itself ; the amount . 
  that does n't sound like msg is to blame . 
  it sounds more like minor food poisoning ( also , a lot more likely ) . 
  it was probably the meat . 
  just goes to show that you can make a career as an actor solely by acting as yourself . 
  i mean , how else can you explain hugh grant ? 
  it 's not that they 're not bothering * anymore * . 
  they 're starting at the bottom , which means rebalancing frigates and destroyers . 
  they have realised that forcing everyone to train racial destroyer iv to get cruisers is pretty rage-inducing when there 's only one destroyer per race , so they 're concentrating on, 
  * rebalancing frigates , then, 
  * adding an additional destroyer hull per race , once they have a role for them, 
  and only after that will they start messing with racial destroyer skill requirements . 
  that article was a lot of backstory for not a lot of analytical payoff . 
  i did both , just in case . 
  confirmed . 
  last year there ended up being a massive deficit in covetor bpcs . 
  according to my spreadsheet , though , the optimal hulk bpc should be made with test reports . 
  [ legion ] ( http://incursions.nexsoft.de/?s=legion ) . 
  proteus would have to fly around too much . 
  hard to say - i only run incursions in logi . 
  should n't be too difficult to join a pug . 
  a couple of faction heat sinks would n't go astray to increase your gear score . 
  yeah . 
  28.95 % chance of the 2-run bpc . 
  average cost per ship is ~ 33.3 mil isk . 
  whatever you prefer . 
  if you want to keep the legion , mise well buy it and use it now . 
  i always thought ` tipper gore ' would make for a really good stage name for an alt-girl exotic dancer . 
  i know the crystal method played live ( or used to ) . 
  i was there at a small concert when their jupiter 6 crapped out halfway through the set and they had to improvise .

  til that mining industry workers in my country are the 5 % . 
  yeah , a lot of very judgemental people apply for positions of authority . 
  not just cops ; heck , the president of your local homeowner association is probably the same type of people . 
  nice try , grower . 
  i explained it to my parents as `` telling fake but amusing stories to your friends , but with rules '', 
  colbert would certainly not approve . 
  no , average cost to produce ( give or take materials ) . 
  the price you 'd pay on the market would be a lot more , because the buyer is not just paying for the t2 bpc , but for the effort , probable isk loss from failed invention jobs , and the limited research slots used to produce it . 
  it sounds very 1 % , but it 's easier for me to work an hour 's overtime and buy a couple of gtc than it is for me to grind incursions or sleeper sites ( i 'll do them for fun , but i wo n't grind mindlessly for the isk ), 
  i pvp until i run out of cash , then i dip into the plex bin vov . 
  the only isk i make in-game is from trading , inventing and manufacturing that happens after i log off . 
  `` business before pleasure '', 
  vindicator would be better for shield fleets , surely ? 
  and you ca n't even extort them for not botreporting them because their isk is dirty :(, 
  no tech 2 skills will be reimbursed . 
  in fact , it 's likely that no skill points will be refunded . 
  you 'll just automatically get levels in the new racial piloting skills . 
  like body corporates , but often for entire housing estates , in charge of being nazis over things that do n't fit the estate covenant . 
  the level of rage over which colonial colours to paint your house is astounding sometimes . 
  they were still ok . not as if they only had one synth each ... 
  i picked mine up via power of two , but it 's really invention that makes the money . 
  manufacturing is just a prerequisite to make stuff from the blueprints . 
  i thought it would be obvious ? 
  so , like evewho.com ? 
  is n't this just like supersdodie ? 
  $ 20/month buys a lot of rifters . 
  they kill tengus fairly well . 
  they also have the range , gun resolution and resists to stop oracle/tornado snipers . 
  3 ecm strength rigs + 3 sda = stupidity . 
  instead , go for 2 bcus , 2 sda , large dispersion augmentor ii and some missile rigs , probably a range rig and a rof rig or something . 
  would probably be better with 2 neuts rather than neut + nos, 
  oh , and ofc change the multi-spectrals with racial ecm based on the target . 
  on second thoughts , i 'm probably being trolled by this fit . 
  t1 torps should be enough , although you might benefit from a mwd on the fit . 
  sidekick specialization trained to v. 
  i always merge at the last minute . 
  when it 's time to let others merge in , i only let one person in front of me before going . 
  i 'm a nice guy , not a doormat . 
  someone post a transcript !, 
  yes , but whoever gave you the trial wo n't get any rewards . 
  smart thinking , 
  bonus points if they label them as `` extra-large '', 
  sorry , i use my phone for that , precisely because the mac does n't have decent eve apps ( aside from pyfa ), 
  fucking everyone in brisbane speeds . 
  i go 10km over the limit and everyone * still * passes me . 
  same tv shows ... 
  explicit in what way ?
