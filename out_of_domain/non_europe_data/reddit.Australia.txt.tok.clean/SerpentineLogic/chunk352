  economy of scale is a big deal though . 
  they have their finger in a lot of markets , including corporate . 
  also , they run a very efficient operation . 
  their weak point is online , but they do n't need to rush that when they have the ability to blend online and in person advisory services , which is a unique selling point for them . 
  basically their online offerings stop new entrants getting huge by offering the simple stuff , and letting human consultants handle the tricky stuff that e-tailors ca n't do . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a rock solid plan , but it 's been working for about ten years longer than i thought it would , and shows no sign of stopping . 
  in fact , [ nutrient-fortified peanut butter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plumpy%27nut ) is a really good treatment for famine in africa , because they commonly eat peanuts and do n't have the allergy problems that some westerners have . 
  peanut butter has a long shelf life and does n't require refrigeration , which is nice . 
  it 's even worse than that . 
  cold eggs get condensation when you take them out of the fridge . 
  condensation weakens the coating around the shell , and makes it possible for bacteria to get in . 
  that 's why in america , where eggs are washed before packing , you must refrigerate them . 
  conversely , if you do n't refrigerate your eggs , for christ 's sake * do n't get them wet * . 
  ( yes , also , do n't feed them after midnight ), 
  i 'm dismayed that you play an online game yet seem incapable of finding breasts elsewhere on the internet . 
  no , it 's an oculus exclusive . 
  buy it from their store and they wo n't care what hardware you run it on ( provided ccp gets it working on both head sets ), 
  in rebuttal : https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/40ea0x/i_am_palmer_luckey_founder_of_oculus_and_designer/cyue2n1?context=10000, 
   when we say `` oculus exclusive '' , that means exclusive to the oculus store , not exclusive to the rift . 
    lets say i 'm dev x , and oculus funded my game . 
  am i allowed to implement openvr support to my game ? 
   there are several games we have funded that also integrate steamvr support ( i am not aware of any commercial software using openvr ) . 
  we do require oculus sdk integration for everything in our store , funded or not . 
  [ more discussion here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/40in44/there_are_several_games_we_have_funded_that_also/ ), 
  let 's compare the options to make walking in stations ' a thing ', 
  * leverage ue4 ( the platform your newcastle studio just developed a game on ), 
  * use carbon , which is the in-house game engine that the current wis code is based on and is known for poor performance , throw a shit-ton of money and developer time to make it not-so-terrible, 
  i do n't know ; seems like such a hard choice to make ... 
  competitive multiplayer is fine if there 's good matchmaking . 
  how 's the matchmaking ? 
  is there a matchmaking ranking ? 
  fair enough . 
  after trying out the matchmaking of other games ( especially mobas ) , it has become really clear to me that it 's better to wait 2-5 minutes for a game if it will be at least vaguely fair . 
  really ? 
  i find it much the opposite . 
  in early autz , the games are really lopsided , with dumb luck determining whether which side gets the guy 500mmr + higher than anyone else . 
  in late autz , there 's a lot more international players , but when i queue , i get 9 other scrubs that are more my level . 
  bots until you can beat medium difficulty , imo, 
  and it taps for < , 
  that 's totally okay with me !, 
  he started off okay , but he stayed too long and his policies stopped being plausible and started being ideological . 
  is there any * other * type of sex tourist ? 
  no , not really . 
  poor man 's shield only works really well vs heroes . 
  ah , death prophet is the same . 
  what does g give you ? 
  given that b provides disruption * and * acceleration . 
  if anything , you 'd need a splash to shore up the aggro matchup , which g does n't help with . 
  some of my relatives were upset that i barred them from seeing my new baby for the first few months unless they got vaccinated . 
  login , upvote . 
  * adults need booster shots - they had n't had one for close to 20 years, 
  * babies ca n't get their first whooping cough vaccination until they 're ~ 6 weeks old , and need another 2 injections over the next few months before they 're really protected . 
  i want to try this out on legion commander, 
  yeah but yeah but if fewer babies die , that means more people buying cough medicine as adults . 
  those fucking * monsters * . 
  there 's a less drastic ` personal locator beacon ' thing that makes the state emergency service less cranky when you use it on land . 
  blade mail . 
  there is nothing better than saying `` stop hitting yourself , stop hitting yourself '' as the carry tries to out dps you . 
  but trading the dust ce codes is allowed on the dust forums . 
  i really ca n't rely on others at my tier . 
  it 's not that different to buying a deso in that regard , if it 's used offensively , except you have a passive defensive bonus when not using it . 
  i understand that it 's a lot better if a support uses it so i do n't have to buy it , but it 's a very useful thing to have for yourself ; an offensive tool that transitions to a defensive tool when you do n't need it . 
  ( note that moment of courage procs even on missed attacks ), 
  you forgot orb of venom . 
  are you on yasp ? 
  for instance , [ analysis of this game ] ( https://yasp.co/matches/2048753643/analysis ) shows that pudge need to be better with upgrading the courier , etc , etc. 
  what 's the match id of a recent game ? 
  i have seen a lot of people skill this way recently . 
  if you buy dominator , definitely use it , if only to grab an alpha wolf . 
  you also need more rune control . 
  do you think you would have died less with a mobility item or euls ? 
  i understand if you decided ' i have to be the right click carry in this match ' but if lc gets out of control , you might have been better off going for a more disabling/teamfight/keep-up-with - slark-and-lc build . 
  i think your draft means you 're clearly in a position 2 rather than needing to carry , so your itemisation does n't really reflect that so much . 
  what do you think ? 
  i 'm sure you can afford to pay for some soda with all the benjamins still left in your pocket after paying only $ 99 to fly to iceland . 
  hotd is actually a rare first item pickup for sf - usually you rely on your bottle , since you 're so mana hungry that you use it seconds after you fill it , and * then * send it back to the fountain to fill up between runes . 
  you sometimes see a casual mask towards the end of the landing phase ( 9-10 minutes ) but after that , you need to itemise more for hero kills . 
  say you pick up something like euls . 
  it provides you with move speed , mana regeneration , allows you to escape from solo pick offs , and allows you to initiate by tornado into point-blank-range ultimate . 
  this is great if you find yourself firmly dropping in the effectiveness order of your team . 
  this is the start of a build that ends up with you going guardian greaves etc. 
  alternatively , you buy blink or shadow blade . 
  sb allows for the invisible-point-blank ultimate , blink allows for much greater mobility without mana cost . 
  this is a more carry-style build . 
  take a look at these couple of games and see if you can understand the thought process behind the itemisation . 
  if you 're quick , you might be able to download the replays .

  not sure . 
  maybe some games are n't worth building the armour on , or priorities changed . 
  why spend cards trying to get lands that do n't combo ? 
  all the lands do is to get 2 mana , you 're better off putting in mind stones or something rather than contort your mana base to add green . 
  or , just use discard instead , like this deck does . 
  more to the point , use a different item guide than the default . 
  torte delini 's guides are generally okay . 
  it 's actually cheaper to buy an oculus rift , pay someone to livestream fanfest , then throw the rift in the trash than to fly there : /, 
  username checks out . 
  that 's my link that the bot gave you . 
  message me if you have any questions about the process , or just general eve-related stuff . 
  i think the takeaway from this is `` if you do n't want roos to eat your grass , fence it properly '',
