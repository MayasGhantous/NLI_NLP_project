  i 'm on 165 matches and am still on level 45/50 . 
  when nerds meet reality, 
  i think it 's entirely possible that trump beats clinton in some kind of ronald reagan style upset, 
  or avoiding freedom of information requests by not using state department email servers . 
  people forget that only half of pl s damage comes from his illusions . 
  '' [ goodbye , mr hooper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxlj4tk83xq ) '', 
  why are you instantiating random for that ? 
  math.random ( ) is more idiomatic java . 
  way more effort than just maintaining eye contact . 
  but was included in the [ patch ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/42z6h9/analysis_dota_2_update_main_client_january_27_2016/ ) notes . 
  it does n't play then - it only plays when you blink between 960 and 1200 . 
  it 's slightly deeper - it 's basically `` blink sound with added drama '' . 
  edit : see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie_ii-xfblk, 
  interesting . 
  in australia , we get a 50 % rebate , which allows for some level of price discrimination ( but we still pay way more than $ 7/day ), 
  still , the discount is enough that 3.5 hours at minimum wage pays for 630am-6pm child care for a day . 
  `` i got a case of ~ ~ yellow ~ ~ white line fever '', 
  phew , good thing bad luck stops happening after you decide to have kids . 
  that 's your goal ? 
  `` let 's get standards of living up to 1000bc then leave it at that '' ? 
  and you could install an aghanim 's modified tractor beam to reduce the hook cool down to 4 seconds !, 
  he 's wearing it * ironically * . 
  it 's [ not always ] ( http://www.engrish.com/category/clothing/ ) ironic . 
  who else gives out mana ? 
  air units would clear them out too . 
  assists is a bit low . 
  silencer really needs to be in range to get intelligence stacks . 
  also , assist gold is nice . 
  note that desolator provides a decent flat increase to right click damage , unlike the new basher or monkey king bar . 
  so , if you have crits or care about damage per attack , that might extend its usefulness . 
  for instance , desolator on phantom assassin an be a good pick up . 
  set up a market, 
  do some data mining first , see what the market needs, 
  to do what, 
  probably try the zkillboard api, 
  i have , on occasion , bought 3 salves to apply to people after a team fight . 
  press the plus sign . 
  do slows count ? 
  just stock a few attribute implants and some ammo to start with . 
  needs link to previous week , imo . 
  troll priest has mana regeneration aura , it 's great for lanes . 
  brutal, 
  halberd is better than crest, 
  little known fact : kiwis invented the sheepskin condom , although it took a number of years before they discovered that you did n't need the whole sheep . 
  `` it 's just a prank , bro '' -- god, 
   get smoke and go gank with another hero or two, 
  note that as a support , you should always buy a smoke ( ideally two ) . 
  it 's good to have one handy , but it 's also useful to smoke up and drop wards in their jungle - sure it costs some gold but it 's cheaper than needing to teleport out , or , worse , die . 
  to be fair , one does not simply create a unified field theory . 
  that cuts off the desolator route , though . 
  perhaps they should shorten that list of bills . 
  that does n't answer the question, 
  * do n't invest too much in the aura until late game . 
  level 1 is okay to sap healing , but more skill points should only be spent above level 10 . 
  * max sadist asap . 
  level 4 is twice as good as level 3 , and means you never run out of mana again . 
  you may still run out of hp though . 
  * max your heal next and be prepared to spam it . 
  * you are a good mekanism carrier because of sadist . 
  you may or may not need guardian greaves . 
  play it by ear . 
  * blademail is a situationally good pick up - you punish opponents for attacking you , and your aura and heals punish them for * not * attacking you . 
  who said anything about a girl ? 
  the ^ ^ freddy mercurial candidate, 
  no timely reinforcements ? 
  this is the best post you 've made this year . 
  forums are so 20th century, 
  `` not a neo nazi , but # 1 with neo nazis '', 
  maybe commerce law ? 
  did electrical , am software developer . 
  not complaining at all . 
  buy plex , donate to charity, 
  https://youtu.be/ojujdf9wxwa or at least for a while before he starts buying 2 necro books ( stop with one necro book ), 
  power is too precious to be given to people with * scruples * . 
  many countries allow you to buy private health insurance , for such things as, 
  * choice of doctors / access to private hospitals, 
  * private rooms, 
  * lowered or eliminated co-payments, 
  * cover for stuff not covered by the public system ( cosmetic surgery , experimental treatments ), 
  * skipping the waiting lists for non-essential surgery ( kinda important if you just tore your acl ), 
  we used to have this site : https://dust514.com/news/blog/2013/10/community-spotlight-dustcharts/, 
  but it stopped working . 
  now we only have dotlan stuff . 
  do you see a breeze effect when in the fountain ? 
  do you see an icicle effect when you teleporting ? 
  if so , it has been applied . 
  not sure , but i thought all effects work in bot matches . 
  you have actually activated the winter thing after you bought it , right ? 
  winter terrain needs to be equipped but the effects should just turn up . 
  effects seem to be temporary , historically . 
  some things are n't , like ( non-seasonal ) terrain/weather effects , but pretty-much all the non-hero effects have expiry dates . 
  note that terrain and weather effects are usually * stretch * goals of the international compendiums , rather than stock rewards . 
  kinda yeah but no . 
  recycling is only available when an event is active . 
  it just happens that a * lot * of events have been active since ti5 . 
  nab 's still in the middle of a banking platform upgrade . 
  it would be interesting to see whether this is a ` strength to strength ' appointment or a ` rats leaving a sinking ship ' one . 
  ironically , carrier warfare in eve is changing to be more like warships . 
  why not have an automated transfer to take money out of your account each pay period ? 
  sure , why not ?
