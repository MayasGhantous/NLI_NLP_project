  spirit breaker just stops attacking sometimes if the setting is off . 
  project discovery - can you suggest only getting rewards for ` correct ' answers please ? 
  the current incentive is just to do as many as possible , regardless of correctness . 
  he graduated from chair sniffing, 
  the difference is that steve irwin was genuinely like that . 
  this is important to know , since you deny a lot of gold if you eat one . 
  your employer paying the rego is like a pay rise , so it 's definitely something to push . 
  the two hardest things about your first job are salary negotiations and eventually quitting . 
  do n't be afraid of either one , just prepare accordingly .

  2 points in e makes a difference in sustain though . 
  you can get away with 0-1-2 . 
  anything else is gravy . 
  but no more than that, 
  well , the last thing you want is to leave the jungle for a duel gank with no hp, 
  and the occasional person trying to do insurance fraud by jumping in front of their car ... 
  why do you have to be like this, 
  tree and shadow demon are probably not the right heroes ( edit : for you ) to counter spectre . 
  try someone who can constantly pressure her throughout the game , like sb or tusk . 
  op is obviously not good with sd though , so a strength hero might be more their style . 
  one of the guys i work with is indian . 
  he gets really annoyed at us for referring to all indian food as curries . 
  `` a curry is one particular dish !, 
  would you like it if i called all your food ` burgers ' ? '', 
  he has a point . 
  korma , vindaloo , rogan josh . 
  we call them all curries , he disputes this grouping . 
  over time speaker = ccp rouge . 
  calling it, 
  it 's / u/wollari 's,

  ok , so you know about the obvious eye spots , of which there are 1 near each ward and 3 around towers on each side . 
  obviously , you use those when you, 
  * care about wards, 
  * are pressuring their offlane t1, 
  * need vision of the top and bot entrances to their base ( or your base eep ), 
  but there are other spots that are useful . 
  * [ this spot ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/?observer=-1038,1168 ) provides ward vision as well as covering a dire jungle exit , good to protect against wrap around ganks or pudges . 
  you can place it further bottom if you need vision of mid . 
  * speaking of mid vision , [ this ward ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/?observer=70,-1001 ) is popular if you need to see what radiant mid is doing . 
  * if you 're radiant warding dire jungle , then [ these spots ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/?observer=-4785,4168-5151,3306;-3248,4826;-3049,3306;-64,2136;-1115,4264 ) are good ( besides the eye spot near their t2 , which is really good, 
  * this map has n't been updated to the 6.86 map , but [ these spots ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/?observer=4850,-4381;1557,-4618;660,-2643 ) are good for vision of radiant jungle ( as well as the eye spot which , again , is really good ), 
  * getting high ground vision of the enemy base is also important . 
  the commonly-warded spots are [ here ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/?observer=-3607,-5225;4914,2762;3229,4730 ) - so if you 're defending , de-ward those spots . 
  there are two types of people :,

  yeah you can do it from outside, 
  i feel the strange urge to buy vanilla icecream, 
  here 's hoping, 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but the entry standards for immigrants are considerably higher than the standard required to stay if you were born here . 
  `` you 're the best of what 's left '',

  this explains much, 
  to be fair , if you lived under the chinese communist party , you 'd stash some foreign currency away too .

  black ops bridge a blockade runner . 
  i find 2 levels in e puts less pressure on my health bar . 
  it sucks getting a quick level 6 then not having enough health to duel with . 
  if i were in a situation where i could n't afford to buy the battle pass , i would wait for the international compendium instead , and get full use of that . 
  i would not recommend orb of venom on a ranged hero , especially an intelligence hero . 
  it gives you items for playing . 
  it 's nice to have , but not required to play - just a bit of fun in addition to your normal games . 
  some games you lose , no matter what you do . 
  this was one of them . 
  take heart that , some games you win because the enemy team has someone like that . 
  ok , you need to create a stable of heroes you 're familiar with . 
  i 'd aim for about ten . 
  * 2 offlane , like tusk and timber, 
  * 2 mid , like death prophet and od, 
  * 2 carry , like gyro and juggernaut or whatever, 
  * 2 support , like lion for single target and dazzle for team fight, 
  * 2 flexible heroes , like lina, 
  a value point is all you need to get movement speed boost .
