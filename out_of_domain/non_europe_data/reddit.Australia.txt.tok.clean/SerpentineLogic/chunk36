   faint of heard, 
  speak up , i ca n't hear you . 
  it 's a classic campbellian literary technique anyway . 
  why not go with a dual-tracking link fit that requires an inbound cap transfer ? 
  not as if there wo n't be another two guardians in fleet . 
   what 's a hm tengu and what 's a ham tengu ? 
  heavy missile tengus use heavy missiles , which will easily hit out to 100km with decent skills . 
  the decreased fitting requirements often mean they 're very durable , but even with t2 missiles , they lag behind hamgus in the dps stakes ( not as much as you 'd imagine though ), 
  ham tengus use heavy assault launchers , which are slightly harder to fit , but do more dps . 
  their range is a lot shorter ( about 20km give or take ) so they are most useful in nullsec anomalies and other situations where you do n't have to chase your target all over the grid . 
   how is the playing style of the tengu ? 
  1 . warp into anomaly, 
  orbit something at 15km with afterburner on, 
  1 . kill all the frigates and elite cruisers, 
  1 . swap to t2 missiles, 
  1 . kill everything else, 
   i heard tengus are `` for high sec only '' as they are a prime gank target . 
  would staying in high sec alot limit my isk/hr alot if i were to get a tengu ? 
  frankly , if you 're in * any * ship outside of high-sec ( and sometimes inside ) , you 're a gank target and should accept that the ship you 're currently flying will blow up eventually . 
  if you 're using missiles , the tengu is one of the premiere ratting ships , due to its combination tank , medium-to-high dps , range and align time . 
  you should still be able to get into incursion fleets in a tengu , so you might like to look into that in addition to missions . 
  yes . 
  ( in part because they 're so easy to train into , compared to a tech 2 autocannon-fit machariel ), 
  for extra points , use friend-or-foe missiles so you do n't have to target anything . 
  yes , they are a real thing . 
  [ corps you may be interested in joining ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/s9x0p/reve_job_fair_part_2/ ), 
  um , a lot of people confuse hunger and thirst . 
  if you are one of these people , here 's a tip : try drinking a glass of water . 
  if you 're still hungry 30 minutes later , you 're * actually * hungry . 
  over a * 24 hour * period , 3 to 4 litres is still high and is actually a sign of the onset of diabetes so i strongly suggest you get yourself to a doctor . 
  even if you 're not diabetic , i 'd be careful about your electrolyte levels . 
  over a * 4-hour * period , you 'd [ probably die ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_intoxication ) . 
  shoulda had another web, 
  what 's the worst they can do ? 
  hold onto you really tight , crushing your ribs ? 
  drop on your head , breaking your neck ? 
  it might not be high enough to be a problem ( your doctor will know ) , but it * is * high - most people drink about half the amount of water you do . 
  relevant username ? 
  he 's my favorite * rocky * character . 
  just like they did with * john carter * ? 
  no , he was the private ryan that ended up being the wrong guy . 
  silence !, 
  i keel you !, 
  unfortunately , the director ( who had free rein due to his past successes at pixar ) thought that the john carter novels were as famous and cherished worldwide as they were to him . 
  welp . 
  yeah it 's stupid that there 's only about 3 skills you need to get to v to have a fully fledged manufacturer character . 
  it 's just weak from a character advancement standpoint . 
  a 40 million skill point combat character is getting into some good ships but by no means has maxed anything out . 
  a 40 million skill point industry character has already run out of useful skills and is likely on its third or fourth cross-industry training plan . 
  you appear to be terrible at reading . 
  i 'm willing to cut a deal on a share of the karma if you deliver on a pos rewrite :p, 
  i am a bit worried about making outposts redundant , but i 'm sure the game devs would have got that covered . 
  nemesis only requires frigate construction iv . 
  more inconsistencies . 
  [ definitely ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=42 ) [ .

  first mint chip , now this . 
  i have a 9m sp alt that can invent anything . 
  that 9m includes flying a * jump freighter * ... 
  yeah , something like 15 million sp to max out all leadership skills . 
  lack of capital is a big hindrance to new traders . 
  it 's also a quarter of the price . 
  the way i see it , if you have an orca alt and want the flexibility of a jump-capable ship , the rorqual is an obvious choice . 
  * check out [ these ] ( http://fulldisclosureeve.wordpress.com/ ) [ blogs ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/ ) and maybe you 'll learn something useful to you . 
  i hear eve isk per hour is good , if you like desktop apps . 
  he was in * blackadder * and * the bill * . 
  the only way to be more british is to guest star on the goodies as doctor who 's travelling companion , who happens to be a beatle . 
  well , at least it 's not lupus . 
  go [ here ] ( http://gemblog.nl/skill/ ) , put api key in , get a quote . 
  * bounties being zero-sum ( i.e. 
  solve the ` get an alt to pop you ' trick ), 
  * being able to sell your kill rights to others, 
  * in fact , a full contract killing marketplace would be good, 
  but the biggest thing is to stop pirates from getting their mates to pod them to pick up the bounty . 
  until that 's fixed , the entire bounty hunting system is pointless . 
  so says [ r/straya ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/straya/comments/rj8i8/straya_call_ya_mates_cunt_and_cunts_mate/ ) . 
  go to eve-kill , filter by region = syndicate , find some alliances that you like the look of . 
  you 've never heard of conan the librarian ? 
  amusingly , that works regardless of which side of the political spectrum you 're on . 
  that is n't a good thing . 
  i have a feeling eve is a little * too * real to you . 
  the block and other handyman shows are terrible , as far as product placement goes . 
  they have no self-restraint . 
  if it 's so easy ( and yeah , it kinda is ) , then take extra courses so you can get to the advanced subjects sooner . 
  do n't make a right ? 
  nothing cures depression like the enthusiasm of teens . 
  well , that and antidepressants . 
  one unit of ore refines to more than one unit of minerals . 
  something like this would work :, 
  * you can put a bounty on someone you have kill rights on , or who is -5 sec status or below, 
  * each time their ship is destroyed , the 30 % base insurance gets given to the killer instead of them, 
  * each time they get podded , their clone cost gets given to the killer, 
  if the kill rights expire and the pilot is above -5 sec status , ( most of ) the remaining bounty is refunded . 
  otherwise , the bounty persists until it gets used up . 
  but you * can * train whatever you want . 
  the default attribute config is designed so you can train anything at roughly the same speed . 
  attribute remaps are there for those who want to accept a penalty in order to reap a benefit , but they 're not mandatory . 
  the easiest thing to do is go to the [ minmatar faction killboard ] ( http://minmatar.eve-kill.net/?a=home ) , then choose a corp from there ( either the matari corps attacking , or the amarr ones being shot at ) . 
  you can look at the corp kill stats and use evewho to determine their size and relatve activity and make your choice on who to apply to . 
  looks like someone got confused between a broadsword and a claymore .
