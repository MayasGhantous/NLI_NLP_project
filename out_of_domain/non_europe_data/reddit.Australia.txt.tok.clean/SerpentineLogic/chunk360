  i put in a few runs from time to time , just so i can put a python mine in the cargo of each ship i fly . 
  chump block with [ [ matter reshaper ] ] ? 
  the bots can even have an mmr so you can tell what level they play as , after they calibrate, 
  i guess my buy orders of popcorn are n't going to be filled . 
  it can be disassembled , so you rarely see it in your final 6 slots , but it has a place as a transitional item . 
  betting sites . 
  please sir , it 's me , your player . 
  faction also overheat for longer , which may be relevant . 
  what bits are you having problems with ? 
  ability build , item build , when to choose ? 
  anyway , i 'll give you my thoughts on those three . 
  * ability build *, 
  laning against melee carries , consider skilling e at level 1 . 
  you can wade into a creep wave and right click them , and still come out even because the creep wave will proc moc . 
  obviously back off once it procs . 
  try it out . 
  generally , there 's two lc ability builds . 
  ** build # 1 power overwhelming **, 
  in this build , you aim for 4-1-1-1 , nuking the enemy out of lane and duelling them when they 're low . 
  this is mana intensive and you 'll need a bottle or soul ring ( or friendly kotl ) . 
  works well with skywrath or aa , but sustain is lower ( hence , bottle ), 
  ** dirty jungle picker **, 
  in this build , you acknowledge that your q is just for getting bonus move speed , and you only put a value point in ( well , maybe 2 points vs pl ) . 
  the rest goes into e and w in that order . 
  you jungle , or tank creep waves , and generally sit there on full health . 
  you do approximately zero nuke damage , but sometimes that 's an acceptable tradeoff . 
  * item build *, 
  ** jungle **, 
  * tango + talon into stout , boots , blink , smoke , gtfo and gank, 
  ** lane **, 
  * tango + stout + whatever into boots , bottle/soul ring , initiation item, 
  after that , up to you , but usual pick ups are, 
  * blademail ( especially if you 're behind ), 
  * s&y - so good for chasing, 
  * ac - it 's like 75 % of a deso but with a buff aura, 
  and if you 're feeling flush :, 
  * moon shard, 
  * * not * heart . 
  you have a heal for pre-duel , you probably are healing during duel , and you ca n't escape after duel because your blink is disabled , so you may as well pop your satanic and heal up on the nearest enemy . 
  heart is great for heroes who can disengage ; that 's not you . 
  * when to pick *, 
  always . 
  j/k just because she 's the 4th-most-picked in pubs does n't mean all games are lc games . 
  if the enemy really wants to 5-man early , you may find that pick offs are difficult and you ca n't get fed fast enough . 
  similarly , if lots of the enemy team has escapes , you might need a different gank hero . 
  and thirdly , if your team ca n't help you much , you will have a bad time . 
  having a friendly nuker is great for duelling ; having a friendly bristleback not so much . 
  electrochemical adds 3.2 heat/cycle . 
  imperial navy adds 3.0 heat/cycle , and it cycles a bit faster too . 
  i hear you can see it from sarah palin 's house . 
  perhaps add a key binding for chat ` get ready ' ? 
  if you have a lane partner who can assist , you should be able to win your crucial first few duels . 
  rip, 
  in games like that , you may have to go midas . 
  i have encountered ` carry ' omni twice in the last 5 games . 
  it would n't have mattered , if we had another support , but having to buy wards and up courier as position 1 makes me a bit annoyed . 
  try medallion instead of armlet . 
  you come online much faster . 
  yet another sma plot, 
  not mjolnir . 
  you do n't benefit from duel stacks . 
  go bf if you need to ( vs pl or whatever ), 
  aghs is good vs damage from other enemies but you still get stunned so it 's situational . 
  a late bkb is generally better . 
  sure , shadow blade first , but hold off on silver edge , only get it when you need it . 
  yasha gives a good speed boost but you 'll have to make do with sb . 
  yes . 
  after a while you can upgrade to solar crest , then later , disassemble into halberd . 
  halberd breaks linkins sphere , as well as stops enemies from interfering while you duel someone else . 
  that 's just the nature of a snowball hero . 
  if you do n't snowball , you 're in trouble . 
  that 's why blade mail is so good , since you leverage their farm to kill themselves . 
  i usually still go blink blade mail ( sometimes assault cuirass ) then mkb . 
  she usually kills herself against blade mail for long enough for me to farm her a few times . 
  i admit i 'm a lot better with blink initiating than shadow blade though , so there 's that . 
  if you ca n't rely on team mates for damage , and need more damage to pick off enemies . 
  ideally you 'd have a support carry the medallion but if it 's the difference between kills and no kills , you take it . 
  i mean , that 's ultimately what armlet is for , too , but for a lower investment and you can upgrade to crest , then halberd as a late game item that 's better than armlet . 
  game i played an hour ago had 17ms ping vov, 
  it 's a caucus . 
  your boss/union leader gets to see [ who votes for whom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilling_effect ) . 
  exaggerations do n't win naval battles . 
  non-guided munitions ? 
  maybe trying to preserve reliable gold ? 
  but that probably does n't account for all those times . 
  or bkb , but hopefully you can initiate fast enough that they do n't have time to pop it, 
   e.g. 
  the chic-fil-a manager forcing the hungry man to pray in order to get a free meal . 
  what an unmitigated * cunt * . 
  i thought everyone knew that kingslayers came in common , uncommon , rare and mythical rarities . 
  oh , is that unusual outside of australia ? 
  not as good for casual lance harassment though . 
  rip kunkka osfrog please buff, 
  what makes you think they would n't proxy those dns servers ? 
  maybe he just ca n't steer . 
  no one was charged for that , though , so it 's totally okay . 
  it runs . 
  it runs a bit hot but it runs . 
  if i were concerned about it , i 'd probably install wine or something . 
  oh , 80 's , but all the inbuilt fans are spinning at 4000rpm so you can definitely hear them .
