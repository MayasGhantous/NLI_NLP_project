  as far as other heroes go , any hero with efficient wave clear or decent illusions can counter push . 
  alternatively , group up and push down a barracks . 
  5 man beats split push , provided you have towers as buffer . 
  that would actually be pretty cool . 
  whoever you vote 1 for will get money from the electoral commission , so there 's that . 
  could be worse ; you could be spending hundreds on pieces of pewter . 
  maybe they got a bulk discount . 
  well , that 's true at least . 
  they were station components , but were renamed to structure components . 
  also , their build costs will change with the next eve release , which is today , so you have 12 hours to determine which build costs are rising and build a bunch of them before the patch hits . 
  in many cases lower , in two cases higher . 
  ok so perhaps a job working at a pool might be possible ? 
  swimming training etc. 
  ridicule . 
  depends on the rate and the loan etc , but expect minimum repayments to be just under $ 600/month per $ 100k you borrow . 
  generally you aim to repay about double the minimum repayment . 
  it 's about the sweet spot for paying down the loan quickly without eating ramen all month . 
   he worked on anything that related to money by himself, 
  incidentally , this is one reason why most financial companies have mandatory vacation time - you ca n't cover up financial fraud for long when you 're not at work to fix the accounts . 
  source : work at a bank . 
   remand your own stuff in counter wars . 
  happens rarely , but it 's a sick play . 
   repeal for just u on [ ... ] flipped walkers, 
  um , [ about that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tronmtg/comments/49ggau/change_in_rules_with_cmc_of_double_faced_cards/ ), 
  he 's saying that , eyeballing it , getting a loan will be iffy if you have < $ 32k deposit . 
  it 's more corruption than capitalism . 
  the soviet union had similar problems . 
  after glasnost the problem just snowballed , but it was always there . 
  also , do n't for a * moment * think america is immune to this kind of shady stuff . 
  shanghai is a special economic area like hong kong , but obviously different . 
  china has so many cities that they can literally run social and economic experiments on them . 
  for instance , there 's a prefecture where local government is democratically elected , just to see how it works out . 
  so , shanghai is pretty liberal and western compared to other parts of china so it made sense to host the major there . 
  hong kong is only recently reunified so it does n't look as good , since there will be the perception that `` oh look , western company hides in the hong kong enclave because they 're unwilling to interact with the part of china that is n't under its heel '' etcetera . 
  moving to hong kong under the same management would n't work , and if you change management , you may as well stay in shanghai and not piss anyone off . 
  here 's a discussion . 
  mildly disappointed that the usa is not in the top 10 . 
  well maybe it 's an improvement ; they 're not lying to themselves any more . 
  that 's not corruption per se ; that 's the difference between a guilt culture vs a shame culture,

  what ? 
  riki was in every photo . 
  the major domestic stock indexes have high weight in the banks . 
  why choose just one when you can spread your risk across all of them ? 
  uh , how did you arrive at that conclusion ? 
   onto a sheet that a group of people were holding, 
   they go after people like palmer and warne as they 're controversial but leave politicians like rudd , abbott and pyne to shovel their shit down our throats scot free . 
  you expected 60 minutes-level investigative journalism from a talk show ? 
  i think [ [ thought-knot seer ] ] does much the same thing , but does n't tax your mana base at all . 
  you might consider replacing some thoughtsiezes with them , so you have fewer dead draws later ( although thirsts will solve that somewhat ), 
  makes sense . 
  brisbane would have to be the toughest seat for him ; they suffered under him in local government as well as state government . 
  i would tip an uber driver a couple of bucks if the fare ended up unreasonably low . 
  stop needling him . 
  does it need to be 3d printed , or would cnc milling suffice ? 
  no , you 're the guy who sees posts about australia and comments about things being upside down . 
  i 'm going to run out of gifs at this rate . 
  it 's okay ; it 's activated paw paw . 
  brissie would have to acquire some , first . 
  2pm @ orleigh park , west end, 
  bit rainy today , though : /, 
  vitamin d supplements are really cheap though . 
  if it 's a conspiracy , it 's a bad one . 
  in fact , why not draw up some zero interest loans , so each kid can loan them money for the parents mortgage , and because it 's an actual , legal loan , it will just get paid out of inheritance without argument . 
  not in south africa . 
  so , buy a wallet with em-blocking sides . 
  it 's like referring to a redditor as ` that guy called / u / ', 
  that says more about you than it does about the city . 
  well , $ 20 is $ 20, 
  cheaper fees , but you do all the re balancing yourself . 
  sounds intriguing though . 
  gives huge survivability and damage , and then you run away after and heal up . 
  [ message the mods ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2ftruedota2 ), 
  that is a word . 
  eve nt seems really well organised though . 
  mad props to the guys . 
  what 's a home loan rate ? 
  so you 'd need to make more like 6 % from the etf , otherwise it 's better to put into your offset . 
  personally , i think a risk-free 6 % return on principal is a really good deal ... 
  it kinda does n't work for me - i partied a few times with a friend who has an mmr and my estimated mmr is suspiciously close to his . 
  and the opponents you are matched with . 
  you had a spectre , and two gank heroes in nyx and legion . 
  you had all the tools you need , with some itemisation choices it should have been okay . 
  er , it 's because in some songs , she sings it hundreds of times and overlays her voices . 
  it 's not impossible to do live , but it would likely be ordinary in comparison . 
  confirming , very few engineers are civil . 
  most lie somewhere on the feral spectrum .

  we have a few systems in null sec if you feel like mining with the kiwis and the germans . 
  people use eggs for that . 
  so i hear . 
  yeah but he * really * wants that blink dagger so it 's okay . 
  could you allow players with the pass to use different skins they do n't own , just for that custom game ? 
  well , perseverance is n't a huge imposition .
