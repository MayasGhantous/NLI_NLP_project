  it costs about the same amount as drums but more focused on sustain than combat . 
  the problem is transitioning into the full linkens . 
  no , but now you have me paranoid . 
  thanks , jadek . 
  it will . 
  it will also be on psvr on day one as well . 
  what are your thoughts on non-pharmaceutical approaches , such as the university of queensland team 's work using ultrasound to temporarily breach the blood brain barrier to trigger microglial cells ? 
  there 's a founder 's pack - normally $ 60 , but free if you ** preorder ** the rift . 
  / thread, 
  my calibration games have been an exercise in frustration . 
  in unranked games , people will pick supports , but in ranked , people will 3rd , 4th and 5th-pick carries even when there 's a pos 1 and 2 locked in . 
  and then we get wrecked by the other team who has a support , so they win one lane at a time and snowball to victory . 
  i 'm seriously considering ditching ranked entirely if it 's going to continue to be such a shit show . 
  my recommendation is :, 
  * pick 4th or 5th, 
  * pick a support based on the draft so far ( defensive support , anti-push , or offensive support , depending on need ), 
  and nothing of value was lost . 
  i suspect i will calibrate around 1.6 k , so there 's that . 
  i have done this a few times , it 's really good for pulling back a creep wave a bit . 
  i thought china was a perfect world ? 
  stop ruining his narrative, 
  for a lot of people , motivation can be boosted by other people 's expectations . 
  so , if there 's a study group you go to regularly , then you will be a bit more motivated to study for the next meeting . 
  in fact , one of the regrets i have about university was not hanging around with some of the better students so their work ethic and habits rubbed off on me more . 
  from a chinese software company ? 
  good luck . 
  and the one on albert street is less than half a block from a grilled , on the same street . 
  i think the strongest argument for voting no is that short terms are better for getting rid of mistakes like campbell newman , since we do n't have an upper house . 
  if the referendum was `` go to fixed 4 year terms ** and ** add an upper house , just like all the other states '' then the result would likely have been different . 
  confirming that sowing panic in team fights is way successful . 
  sorry mate . 
  shields are a thing in eve . 
  getting the order right is important . 
  it 's specialised for mining ice in dangerous spots , like shattered wormhole space . 
  it 's the viator of ice mining , not the obelisk . 
  the idea is that you mine ice in a shattered hole because you need the ice , rather than for money . 
  wow , alp got wrecked . 
  * 5/26 councillors, 
  * 0/1 mayors, 
  why not re-buy the energy booster afterwards , then ? 
  yeah , you know shit is going south when people start talking politely . 
  when someone busts out the `` with all due respect , mate '' then it 's basically all over . 
  i knew they were a bit slow around those parts , but i did n't think it extended to counting ballots . 
  oh i dunno , my local cafe has a chef that used to work at a hilton . 
  i do n't think lex is old enough to get that reference . 
  this is so important when pushing . 
  someone ports in , you send them back and take the tower . 
  there 's always the ebook, 
  in that case , you glimpse the second or third teleport so you can defeat them in detail . 
  you can also glimpse someone if they try to teleport away from you - either glimpse reaches 4 seconds and cancels their tp , or they tp away and get pulled back ( probably with fountain active tho ), 
  details are hidden behind the ` kickstarter-backer-only ' wall . 
  pretty sure that once you have used an item it ca n't be sold for full price . 
  otherwise people would buy temporary bottles all the time . 
  ember can do the same thing with remnant . 
  perhaps bottle is a good pick up on kunkka just like ember ? 
  i found calibration to be terrible but after that , ranked has been fairly good . 
  provides vision, 
  works through bkb, 
  can have multiple active at once . 
  it 's actually her best 1v1 skill , better for mid lane than her wave clear . 
  yes , set up control groups in lobby games . 
  it 's probably better as an escape than as an attack . 
  would make more impact if the colors went from blue to red through yellows ( to mimic increasing heat ), 
  sometimes you just got ta take the piss . 
  so , people would steal them . 
  if you want a land and inevitability , maybe [ [ sea gate wreckage ] ] ? 
  anyone who preordered an oculus rift ? 
  no blue intel, 
  tilt and they win . 
  maybe https://github.com/r4stl1n/allianceauth can ? 
  the sludge is very close to being commercial-grade iron ore fines ( iron ore is mined at 30-60 % + but commercial grades are 58-65 % ) . 
  the problem is probably that it would be a bitch to store and actually refine , unlike millions-of-years-old rock fragments which are pretty stable . 
  then the expensive items should be marked ` $ 100 ( negotiable ) `, 
  that reminds me - any eta on the [ interactive map ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/ ) ? 
  they call us west island, 
  we do n't need to call them anything special , because it goes without saying that nz is part of australia . 
  i do n't know, 
  where to begin . 
  ok , so there 's this , which will get you up to ~ 2014 some time :, 
  after that we all gave up trying to keep track of all the updates so we just point you to http://updates.eveonline.com, 
  sure that makes a decent micro gang but you 'll still get shit on by a svipul fleet , no matter how much em resistance you pile on . 
  my gaming clan is 50 % kiwis , they say it all the time, 
   during the 1st world war , especially in the gallipoli campaign , really showed the world that turkey wo n't back down easy from protecting its borders and that they truly are fearless fighters . 
  in australia , we still reminisce about gallipoli every year and think `` fucking oath those turks were something * else * '', 
  thanks , mr pipe . 
  a match made in heaven . 
  please stay . 
  the only thing missing is a translator roped into being a producer . 
  do n't forget enabling omni to spam spells yet gain mana . 
  stopped giving them tax breaks . 
  like , serious tax breaks , equal to about $ 70k per auto worker per year . 
  let 's dispel this notion that test knows what it 's doing . 
  well , that 's one opinion . 
  that is the exact type of sprinkle that we use . 
  it should still be that . 
  config and autoexec should still be there .
