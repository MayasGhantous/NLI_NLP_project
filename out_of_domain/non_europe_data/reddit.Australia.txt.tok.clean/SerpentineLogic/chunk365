  can be support , but can transition into a core . 
  or , warlock if you need more team fight . 
  there 's an advanced setting that allows it . 
  some competition , finally . 
  you can buy iodised sea salt . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretinism - a serious problem with a simple solution . 
  garden, 
  ironically , nepal and other himalayan countries have major iodine deficiency problems , so op is giving quite the ` fuck you ' message . 
  perhaps more accurately , some developing countries would be in much better shape if iodine deficiency did n't mess with the average iq of their citizens . 
  the usual suspects ? 
  you can buy iodine supplements in liquid form . 
  one drop into a bottle of water , twice a week or so . 
  depends . 
  cow teats may be sanitised with an iodine solution . 
  back in the day of glass milk bottles , the bottles were sanitised with iodine and you probably got enough just from the residue . 
  in modern times , unless your milk is fortified , do n't count on there being enough iodine to matter . 
  it has naturally occurring gold as well . 
  does n't mean it has much . 
  remember you 're only sprinkling on a bit each meal ; it needs to have a certain minimum amount to stop you getting cretinism . 
  that 's my link . 
  feel free to contact me if you have any questions, 
  so , an alt ? 
  perfect is the enemy of better . 
  i think if someone were living so close to the edge , ` savings ' is n't really a thing . 
  i mean , they * already * have a backlog of things they need to spend money on , but ca n't afford to . 
  saving for an emergency does n't make sense when you 're * having * an emergency . 
  not all people are on minimum wage though . 
  * even if * that were the case , a 50 % increase in wages implies a 3 % price rise , which is vanishingly small . 
  no , he said, 
   prices only increase at * 6 % the rate * which wages increase . 
  please read it again . 
  i would like to know this too . 
  my current assessment criteria for bonds are :, 
  * does he look good in a tuxedo, 
  * how good are the stunts, 
  i believe the guy in hansel and gretel praised the ** movie posters ** . 
  one movie in two years does n't sound very wasteful . 
  as far as looking for faults , i do n't subscribe to the just world fallacy . 
  sometimes bad things happen to good people and there 's no hidden personality flaw behind it . 
  ** edit : ** also , guys , the comment i 'm replying to does n't deserve to be -17 . 
  it 's a respectful comment that furthers discussion . 
  the shipping is a massive rip off though . 
   saying you 're a typofile does n't make you typographer,

  * what happens when i program while drunk . 
  i think it would be easier for someone to set up a wtb contract for the plex , and offering market price less 10m . 
  low energy . 
  best wishes , get well soon, 
  oh really ? 
  karn is the scalpel vs the nuke of o stone . 
  use it to pop big threats, 
  use it to deny crucial lands ( especially if combo is threatening ), 
  use it to punish greedy mana bases or to remove colours to protect karn himself, 
  use it to take apart hands if there 's no pressure , and lock them out of the game . 
  a * long * time [ . 
  this needs to be stickied , or on the sidebar , or both . 
  * twisting * the knife . 
  you 'll never be space tyrant with that little attention to detail . 
  yes it is . 
  i 'm pretty sure he has a program to tell him when patches hit . 
  this post is hidden btw . 
  maybe blur needs to be part damage reduction and part evasion . 
  desolator still has the big + damage bonus . 
  just saying . 
  mike mike mike,

  ' / ' application . 
  we 've had issues with ' / ' application at previous logins . 
  some ccp people lobbied to bring it back for citadels , feeling that it deserved another chance . 
  that was a mistake . 
  ' / ' application is an ass , and we wo n't be working with it again . 
  message the mods . 
  probably too late now , but maybe for next time . 
  by accounts * at the time * he was a monster , so they [ pulled him back ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_columbus#accusations_of_tyranny_during_governorship ) to spain while his replacement compiled evidence of his atrocities . 
  15 % of 150k is 22.5 k , that only leaves room for about $ 130/week salary sacrifice into super . 
  as far as seeing a financial planner , you need to do some homework to work out what you can do for easy wins , and to get a good idea about finance . 
  that helps you, 
  a ) do the easy stuff without being charged $ 2000 for a financial plan, 
  b ) know if the financial planner knows what he 's talking about . 
  i do n't think much has changed since kronos expansion . 
  obviously you 'd start off in a mining frigate , but after that it 's mining barges , then [ exhumers ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2014/06/13/exhumers-in-kronos/ ) . 
  [ eve online flight academy channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucczueyqos7d40bkewmjhxgw ), 
  hiding behind the tree and immediately teleporting was the only realistic option . 
  hours4plex + jackknife would work , but crest is probably better if it works . 
  just maintain a positive win rate and you 'll hit the next bracket sooner or later . 
  might take one or two hundred games , but it will happen . 
  prices are rising , supply is dropping . 
  just ... build things and put them on the market . 
  it 's just that simple . 
  that 's why freighters exist . 
  the http://evehistory.com book has been released , not sure about e-book yet . 
  for other stuff , maybe https://evetravel.wordpress.com/lore-survival-guide/, 
  probably not . 
  it takes two to tango . 
  it will add to the days you have left, 
  assuming you do n't have one of the really weird starter packs that require you to not have an eve account ( not even a trial ) . 
  they 're rare , but they show up occasionally . 
  obviously not facebook official, 
  with yasp + + you 'll know you 're about to tilt before you actually do , so you can quickly switch to your surf account .
