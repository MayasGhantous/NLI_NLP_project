  alts wo n't train skills unless :, 
  1 . they 're on different accounts , or, 
  you use rl money or isk to add multiple character training to your account for a month at a time, 
  one * character * per account , yes , unless you pay extra . 
  multiple character training is good if you have an alt character that you use less often but still want more skill points on . 
  having additional accounts is good if you want another character that you plan to play * at the same time * as your first account . 
  with an extra account , the skill training comes included in the subscription , and you can login at the same time as your first account . 
  however , once you stop paying the second account 's subscription , you lose access to that character , whereas you wo n't lose access to alts on your first account , but you can never have 2 characters from the same account logged in at the same time . 
  just go to mygov and roll it out again, 
   medallion actually takes away your armor making you vulnerable to creeps . 
  i see this so often and it 's simply not true . 
  medallion gives you +7 armour passively . 
  when you use the active , both you and your target lose armour . 
  you go from +7 to +0 , and they go from whatever to whatever-7 . 
  at no point do you go from +7 to -7 . 
  as is lc . 
  i log in maybe four hours a month ? 
  but as an industry guy , stuff gets manufactured and sold while i 'm offline , so it 's not bad . 
  well fucking restart those pi extractors yourself . 
  disruptor, 
  ok , well , i guess your options are :, 
  a ) sell the character for isk , then use that isk to buy skill injectors , or, 
  b ) buy skill extractors and fill them up from that character 's sp pool . 
  but , just install allianceauth and you 're done . 
  the benefits of steam are n't really apparent for eve . 
  most people go direct . 
  having said that , you can generate a standalone login later , if you want to connect without using steam . 
  i guess you learned a lesson though . 
  always have a clutch entosis ship . 
  there 's eve online holdem , eve-bet . com , iwantisk , um , i think there was another one that just started out . 
  yes . 
  no idea . 
  no idea . 
  vaguely . 
  eve-bet is more legit , but realistically all the betting site proceeds go into the pockets of one mega-alliance or another . 
  there 's rumours that some of it leaks out into rl money but the last time someone tried , they were banned and their site dismantled ( it was a lot of money at stake though - converted to plex , it would be  $ 1m us ) ... gambling makes a lot of money . 
  4 . eve-bet is probably the best place . 
  5 . define legit . 
  they 're unlikely to be * scams * , because repeat business is more profitable . 
  is it * fair * odds ? 
  most likely , although you never know . 
  which bit ? 
  i 'm using ` evernus-1 .40 ` and it works fine . 
  there 's instructions , but you give them isk and it goes to your account with them . 
  well , it depends on the site . 
  i remember getting money out of somer was basically just via winning lotteries to get the prizes . 
  fewer . 
  good question and in this case it is n't clear cut . 
  fewer is for discrete amounts ( fewer people , because you do n't have fractions of a person ) , less is for continuous amounts like how long something is . 
  for colours it 's a bit unclear whether op was talking about discrete ` named colours ' or the colour spectrum . 
  i figured that he meant ` dogs ca n't see green ' which implied a discrete colour and thus fewer , but happy to agree to disagree if anyone thinks otherwise . 
  give it away, 
  give it away, 
  give it away now, 
  it 's just a social experiment , bro, 
  it looks like it 's on the level . 
  works fine for me, 
  : diplomacy :, 
  yeah , selecting the courier and pressing w sends it to the secret shop , and e sends the items back to stash . 
  useful for buying those items when you are n't near , or do n't have slots to carry . 
  i am australian , so yes , i spell english the english way . 
  it takes a pretty brave person to walk past all those managers wearing hillary shirts to stand in the sanders group when caucusing . 
  secret ballot ? 
  sure !, 
  what a nice boss , giving time out for employees to vote . 
  not so much . 
  it was a clear example of a chilling effect . 
  clearly not high energy . 
  i think this is still bad , but ultimately less serious , because :, 
  * arizona : people wanted to vote , but could n't . 
  * clark county : ( elected ) officials * could * vote , but chose not to . 
  they do n't prove ; they * insinuate * . 
  i 'm specifically comparing arizona with this * particular * situation in clark county , as was op ; not the entire voting process . 
  you can usually pull the hard camp into your creep wave if you attack them as your creeps run past your t 1 tower . 
  this works for safe and off lane , although you may have to cut trees for off lane . 
   an affirmative action bake sale is a type of campus protest event used by student groups to ** performatively criticize ** affirmative action policies by charging students different prices depending on which social or racial group they belong to . 
  so , they do n't even understand that they 're holding an event * designed to cause * the inevitable shitstorm it did . 
  also , the second point in q means that three casts will kill the range creep . 
  well , it kinda is . 
  if iwi could cash out , he would n't still have stupid amounts of isk to throw around . 
  have you seen the range of static field ? 
  it 's massive, 
  shadow shaman is good . 
  the correct term is `` 3 stack '', 
   an obscure law firm in central america is at the centre of the world 's largest data leak . 
   the massive security breach shows how a global industry of law firms and big banks sells financial secrecy to politicians , fraudsters and drug traffickers as well as billionaires , celebrities and sports stars . 
   the expos\u00e9 of panama-based mossack fonseca has been made possible by an unprecedented leak of more than 11 million documents to german investigative newspaper s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung . 
   the leak came from an anonymous source and was then shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists ( icij ) which organised an investigation by news organisations around the world . 
   the cache of documents includes emails , banking details and client records dating back 40 years and reveals the inner workings of a law firm famed for its secrecy . 
  tldr lots of people have untraceable bank accounts . 
   what part of having money in offshore tax havens is illegal, 
  it 's the ** untraceable ** money in offshore tax havens that 's raising eyebrows . 
  i imagine the icelandic pm has some questions to answer about why he has an until-now-anonymous account , given the currency controls the * rest * of the country still suffers under , since the gfc ...

  this goes for both offlane and safe lane , although off lane needs trees cut . 
  was expecting a bit more recursion or graveyard leverage .

  well , you could use map into [ [ tolaria west ] ] into [ [ endless one ] ] or whatever , but if you 're playing u , you may as well go get [ [ academy ruins ] ] and do something more awesome .
