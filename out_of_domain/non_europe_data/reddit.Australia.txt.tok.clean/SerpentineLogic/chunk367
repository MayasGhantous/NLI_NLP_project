  madison 's at 80 % reporting , spread is 12.3 again . 
  looks like it 's not `` pay to win '' , but `` pay to unlock faster '' , ala league of legends . 
   silver credits are accepted for everything related to your progression . 
  there are no gameplay affecting features that are restricted to the use of gold bonds . 
  some features such as the implants may speed up your progression , but the progression related content is identical for all players . 
  which games are those ? 
  hunt, 
  nothing but chin ? 
  should have called it the australian dota social league , because most of us are already on adsl . 
  ^ thx ^ telstra, 
  so , why use muddle when you can gifts or draw cards at instant speed ? 
  only in countries with reciprocal arrangements . 
  would it be greater or less than the level when they realise that a gambling web site out-earns their entire alliance ?

  hello dankness , my old friend, 
  good thing pipes ca n't ever leak then .

  if you do n't have crucible it 's a bit weak .

  they both were . 
  actually , the electoral commission * sends you * id . 
  it 's a little paper cut out with your name , address and a bar code for faster identification at the polling booth . 
  democracy v1.1-beta, 
  we just really did n't like the previous guy . 
  then we immediately started having buyers remorse . 
  i disagree . 
  mandatory voting means that each major party must be vaguely centrist or risk losing a huge demographic . 
  pandering to the extremes does not gain you as many votes as you lose . 
  yeah , very good northern chinese cuisine . 
  presumably they learned a lot from the german reunification so they likely have extensive plans . 
  feeling pretty tempted right now, 
  i have found that stopping my team mates from tilting makes a huge difference . 
  gw also gives access to [ [ timely reinforcements ] ] ... 
  only 2 % of brits . 
  much higher in east asian countries . 
  english is too good . 
  the hard bit is getting it back afterwards, 
  from what i can tell , each 1k mmr you have over your opponents is about an extra 10 percent chance of a win . 
  so i would expect about a 70 % win rate . 
  the point is , iwi probably makes less than somer blink did . 
  if you 're sitting on $ 500k worth of internet spaceship money , how great do you think the temptation would be to cash in ? 
  yachts are n't cheap . 
  imo it 's * great * that they 're spending it on creating content instead . 
  corporate china is a shame culture , but it 's not the only shame culture around .

  why go midas on lc ? 
  she already has good late game , it 's called winning duels . 
  very , very few people play cooperative bot matches compared to solo matchmaking . 
  it 's just the way it is . 
  it is , however , appropriately roman . 
  a plex auction . 
  a dozen slots per month . 
  watch some of baumi 's youtube videos . 
  he plays position 1 a lot . 
  desolator * is * good on pa. 
  it just needs to be part of an actual item plan , not tacked onto the end . 
  that explains the icing . 
  brutor, 
  savage, 
  rekt, 
  soul catcher has a really short range . 
  would be nice to extend it a bit .
