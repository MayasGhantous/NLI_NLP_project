  it provides a huge boost to damage and short-term survivability . 
  very good for an aggressive lc , especially against str heroes and generally-tanky opponents . 
  it is , however , not as good in the long term . 
  after a point , you have enough damage ( especially if you blademail/blink/duel before the enemy can get their bkb off ) and it becomes all about survivability . 
  you will always win the duel , but can you stay alive long enough to clean up the rest of the teamfight ? 
  ac and satanic help you do this , but armlet falls off fast as the nature of fights change . 
  remember , lc is generally slot-constrained , since she needs a blink , bkb and something like blademail to win duels with , so there 's only so many slots to go around . 
  personally , when i 'm behind i pick up a casual medallion . 
  if my opponent is squishy i medallion them and duel - it 's almost as much minus-armour as a deso , so supports will melt even if i have n't snowballed yet . 
  also , it 's good later since you can upgrade it into a solar crest - usually you do n't activate the crest , but i have used it in the past to crest the enemy carry during a teamfight , while i duel a support . 
  i like 40k references but , shit man , that 's just too much . 
  merch is a corp of guys from the penny arcade forums , just like goons are from something awful . 
  oh , yeah , the w-space freeport citadel thing . 
  how about you let whoever lives in syndicate deal with the goon 's multiple-thousand isk poco ~ ~ empire ~ ~ sorry , imperium . 
  it 's standard nomenclature for resistors . 
  * 2r8 = 2.8 ohms, 
  * 2k8 = 2800 ohms, 
  * 2m8 = 2800000 ohms etc, 
  a better idea would be to allow queuing for multiple types of matches at the same time , e.g. 
  * ** ranked ** all pick plus, 
  * ** unranked ** all pick plus, 
  * ** practice ** 1v1 or players-vs-bots ( unfair ) plus, 
  * ** custom ** colosseum or overlord, 
  you 're still most likely to get an all pick match , but at least you 're in the matchmaking queues for the other types , so there 's a * chance * . 
  eyeballing it from someone not in sydney , 150k ? 
  too low ? 
  to lose one thousand members is unfortunate . 
  to lose twelve thousand is carelessness . 
  no joke that 's horrifying . 
  i have n't worked in sydney for almost a decade but salaries used to be ~ 10k above brisbane due to cost of living etc. 
  that would translate to a senior developer being paid ~ 120k + these days , so only five figures is a big drop . 
  tourists , terrorists , spielberg , iceberg , all the same . 
  yeah i guess i resemble that . 
  our area has  100 developers , most of which are offshore . 
  i 'm not casting aspersions on the offshore devs , because if you needed 100 australian developers at short notice , some of them would be utter shit as well . 
  fact remains , some of them are terrible developers , and few of them are awesome devs ( and those that * are * awesome are angling for an on-shore position as you 'd expect ), 
  so , the offshore devs are capable of , say , 90 % of the work . 
  they 're getting paid maybe 60 % of an onshore dev 's salary , so it 's a good deal , right ? 
  the hardest 10 % is handled by consultants , most of which are onshore for various reasons . 
  these guys are n't cheap ( they 're smart enough to know their worth ) but there does n't have to be too many of them , so the cost savings of 100 cheap offshore developers subsidise them fine . 
  so , if you 're a new grad , where do you fit in ? 
  the easy stuff is all done offshore , and you ca n't even do the hard stuff because you do n't have the experience . 
  if op does n't deliver , there 's always http://crowdcarnivore.com.au, 
  after the nerfs to basher and mkb , deso still has its huge +50 damage , which is important when you have an innate crit . 
  added to the 100 % chance of debuff via dagger and you can see how it 's a great item for mid game . 
  being able to dagger someone for your supports to attack while you blink and burst someone down is pretty nice .

  good point .

   who decides that tritanium price in jita ? 
  market demand . 
  it 's not tied to the cost of a plex , although there are certain heuristics like ` what is the most isk/hour i can get by mining high sec ores ' which are a factor i guess . 
   if i pay for my account and the way i want to play it is as a frigate builder , mining my own shit - is n't lowering my isk/hour expectancy the only way to get into a market saturated with high-efficiency builders ? 
  ok , back up . 
  if you do n't mine , you buy minerals for $ x , and manufacture them and sell them for $ x + $ y. 
  one hopes that $ y is high enough , but let 's be realistic - the barrier to entry to building t1 frigates is pretty low , and margins roughly correlate to that . 
  alternatively , you mine minerals then make them into ships . 
  regardless , though , you need $ x worth of minerals to make the ship . 
  you * could * discount the cost of the finished ship because ' i used my own minerals ' . 
  this is also known as ` lol i just sold those minerals to myself for a loss , why am i being such an idiot ',
