  might be a good idea to read his book to learn what his family suffered through to get here first tho . 
  obviously they 'll change it so that ore frigate iv is required in order to train mining barges . 
  your thoughts on these changes are worth blogging about . 
  i also noticed the blanket change of 180s cap recharge time , which , even with the reduced capacitor size of the new ships , seems to be slight buff . 
  nah , tormentor is the mini-apoc . 
  i expect the executioner will be the tackle frigate , once they fix the retardedly low 6 slots it gets .

  most of the times you 'll fight pirate factions , or random mercenaries , or rogue drones . 
  sometimes , you 'll fight the opposing faction , in which case you may decline the mission , or suck it up and harvest the dog tags for later use ( many loyalty point rewards require tags of the opposing faction ), 
  ~ ~ you 'll break even ~ ~ on a small tower , but do n't expect to get rich off it . 
  i would n't do it unless you had a permanent corp presence nearby .

  the cynic in me suspects that the founders and friends each got a lifetime subscription . 
  i 'm not sure you realise how many 425mm railguns are needed for mineral compression - it 's way more than the market can supply ( cheaply ) from rat drops . 
  i would kill for the ability to double-click on a station or lab name when selecting a manufacturing location , instead of clicking the name , then ( of course ) selecting the first free line ... 
  i doubt they changed any back-end stuff this time round . 
  i suggest an int/per remap for a new player with poor support skills , or per/int for someone with not-poor support skills . 
  for the first year or two , you 'll be swapping between combat and support skills so it 's best to get the 1-year remap timer ticking down asap . 
  generally , a new player ends up doing int/per , concentrating on support skills but picking up combat skills where it makes sense , then about 6-9 months in , swapping full per/will to get t2 guns and long-train skills to v. 
  also useful when you 're wormhole-diving .

  welcome to nationalist bogans vov, 
  some questions to ask them :, 
  * what are the unique challenges of stopping cheating in a free-to-play game that connects with a persistent game world such as eve ? 
  are you concerned about the risk that cheating in one game will disrupt play in both ? 
  * do you envision the incarna project as a way to one day allow dust and eve players to interact in the same ` instance ' ? 
  what challenges need to be overcome to realise this vision ? 
  * an fps may be new territory for ccp but not for the industry as a whole . 
  given the accumulated knowledge of years of seeing what does and does n't work , what pitfalls have you avoided and challenges have you identified based on this ? 
  to be fair , part of his renumeration package is rmt and botter tears .

  til kids are casually cruel to others . 
  [ of course not . 
  ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/graphics/icons/64/icon03_08.png ), 
  not terrible . 
  very long tho . 
  i believe the clinical term is ` cockblock ' . 
  my setup when i was doing this sort of thing a lot :, 
  * command centre upgrades iv , other relevant skills at iii or iv, 
  * 1 spaceport ( acts as silo as well ), 
  * 1 basic factory for every 6000 units of p0 you can produce per hour ( the scanning screen will tell you this ), 
  * 1 extractor with as many heads as possible without overproducing . 
  * do n't bother with connecting the command centre ; it ca n't hold enough to be useful . 
  i 've never produced in high-sec , but in low-sec you can usually run 6-8 basic factories non-stop on 24 hour programs . 
  in nullsec , it 's more like 8-10 factories . 
  so , you should be able to get * at least * 1 million isk revenue per day in lowsec per planet if you apply yourself . 
  ( closer to 3 million per planet in nullsec ), 
  depending on the system and what i 'm extracting , i sometimes use the fifth planet to combine all four p1 materials into a p3 material , but then again , i usually own the customs offices so i 'm not paying tax , 
  do n't forget the nosses for the smaller ships so they can leech off the capitals when neuted by the sleepers . 
   if i got a 5 % to all turret damage and a 5 % to projectile turret damage , would that be a 10 % overall damage increase with no stacking penalty ?!? 
  it 's better than that . 
  turret damage will be, 
  do n't forget the 5 % rate of fire implant , which will be, 
  100 % \\* 1.05 \\* 1.05 \\* ( 100/95 ) = 116.05 % dps, 
  * [ gunnery implants ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/gunnery-implants/ ),

  you can tell you 're at the right hotel because there 's a [ yellow sign ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/carcosa-logo.gif ) out the front . 
  the ones that angle back are generally ok , since , well , you were going to get hit by a car anyway . 
  however , the bull/roo bars that i used to see as a kid [ slope forward ] ( http://www.bullbarsaustralia.com.au/images/products/15/holden%20ve%20mccann.jpg ) , kind of like an upside-down digger attachment . 
  they 're a lot more effective at keeping cattle or roos from sliding up your bonnet after impact ( which generally results in them going through your windscreen and killing everyone in the car ) . 
  however , the top bar is much more likely to utterly crush a person 's rib cage if you hit a human , so they 're technically illegal in australia . 
  i now have a new nickname for anesthesia . 
  well , implants are reversible ... 
  like in * lost * ? 
  i think so :-(, 
  at your level , the main risk is that your corpmates decide to try out their guns on your ship , which they are allowed to do , even in high-sec . 
  assuming you 're not flying anything you ca n't afford to replace , any potential loss can be mitigated , since at worst , you lose one ship then quit the corporation . 
  personally , if your recruiter has been playing a few years , * he * should be donating ships and stuff to * you * . 
  it was . 
  i have no idea how to fit a phoenix , but even this terrible glass-cannon fit would be better than what that fit had .
