  `` he 's a bastard , but he 's ** our ** bastard '', 
  actually they kinda kept it - they cut medicare payments for doctor consults . 
   it can do some amazing things . 
  i 'm still on the fence about the whole flesh interface thing , though . 
  liberals : meet us halfway on $ political_position, 
  * labor takes one step towards libs *, 
  * liberals take one step away from labor *, 
  liberals : labor wo n't even meet us halfway on this !, 
   ** specific responsibilities of the role and qualifications of the ideal candidate include : **, 
   * correct usage of tildes, 
   * over 9000 reddit karma,

  fish factory in brisbane is good . 
  they sell fresh whole fish as well . 
  i would play the shit out of an epic-scale 40k rts . 
  is this a gotrek and felix reference ? 
  might have been just a gamejacking . 
  this bag she carried - it would n't by chance be a carpet bag , would it ? 
  is n't mordheim a lot like that ? 
  i dunno ; games workshop was pretty arrogant in those days . 
  they still are ; but they used to be , too . 
  slark is clearly a clan eshin assassin . 
   * chaos knight as a chaos knight, 
  well , * that * was unexpected .

   so unless your pc is from the stone age it will run . 
  i have a macbook . 
  rip, 
  played a game against od who had maxed his w. raindrops really helped vs the harassment . 
  the costs to the state from each case of fetal alcohol syndrome are pretty fucking excessive btw . 
  players register their auto exec scripts with tournament organisers ; the organisers check them before they install them on their pc .

   i still miss my chromosome heavy, 
  chromosome was the last patch that still had unfucked mouse input ;(, 
  before or after ? 
  i 've seen conflicting reports . 
  the sports require different skill sets and ideal body types . 
  i do n't think there 's as much cross over as you imply . 
  it 's reasonable to assume that there are differences in how the body treats 2 days with little food ( ` did you forget to eat because of netflix ? 
  ' ) , compared to 4 days ( ` shit just got real did n't it ' ) . 
  ugh , age of sigmar worst age .

  the stuff that uber does ( credit card payment , rating system , transparent locations and routes , culling bad drivers ) is also available to taxis . 
  no political party will fit * perfectly * with an individual 's opinions . 
  the idea is to look at their policies , work out what issues are important to you , and vote for the party that * best * fits you . 
  ( and review their policies every election - all parties drift over the years , some of them in ways you wo n't like ), 
  some recruiters post fishing ads for jobs that do n't actually exist ; they get your details so they can submit you for other jobs they have n't found a candidate for yet . 
  some employers specify that they do n't want their name attached to the position because they do n't want to be contacted directly - they 're paying the agencies to screen the resumes instead . 
  some recruiters scrub the names of the employers so the position does n't get poached by rivals .

  lens flares ... 
  what could possibly go wrong ... 
  there 's another level above catastrophic , but if that occurs , nobody will know because the paint on the sign will have burnt off .

  if someone else has vlads , maybe pipe or cuirass ? 
  sniper fire . 
  engineering firms take interns ( student engineers ) . 
  however , they are paid 60-90 % of the going rate for a graduate engineer , because companies realise that shorting your prospective employees is a good way to never hire any of the good ones . 
  reading these comments , i sense a pattern . 
  it 's mostly people dealing with the american red cross that have issues with them . 
  go into lane with 8 tangos , or plan to buy a second set . 
  get a shield , upgrade to pms if you get too much harassment . 
  or , get raindrops if it 's nukes . 
  but that 's the way to bet . 
  eyeball creepy pasta . 
  sriracha is really good on rice ( or tuna . 
  or both ),
