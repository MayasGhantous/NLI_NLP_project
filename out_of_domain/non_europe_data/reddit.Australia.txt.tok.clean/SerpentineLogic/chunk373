  * there 's lots more . 
  you can create your own build , i guess ? 
  or look through other builds to see whether they match . 
  damage block is better as the illusions get weaker . 
  ck has really tough illusions so it 's not as effective as on , say , pl, 
  election fraud is a totally different issue to which voting system you use . 
  if you have a fraud issue , you 'll have it irrespective of the ballot system . 
  that 's not fraud ; that 's informal ballots that must be interpreted according to whatever the rules of the election are . 
  the fraud comes in where those election rules are disregarded in favour of a particular candidate . 
  if your area is prone to election fraud , then it wo n't matter whether there 's a 4 % informal ballot rate , or a 0.00004 % rate * if you ignore the fucking rules * . 
   the point of my original post was that this paranoia would be larger in a ranked choice system due to the complexity of not only voting the ballots , but also counting them . 
  it 's hard to know what to say against arguments about perception . 
  i do know , however , that most commonwealth countries ( canada , australia , new zealand etc ) do perfectly well with hand-counted irv ballots with objectively-reported very low instances of election fraud . 
  ( do not underestimate the scrutiny of very large arrays of retirees watching each other count votes ), 
    if you have a fraud issue , you 'll have it irrespective of the ballot system . 
   this is n't accurate at all . 
  that 's one opinion . 
  i 'll point out that election fraud seems to be quite a problem for america recently . 
  i do n't hear very much about tampering with ballots though - it mostly seems to be disenfranchisement by various means , like polling booth availability , procedural rules at conventions , striking people off the electoral roll etc - all of which are independent of how the ballots are filled out . 
  so , maybe something like this ? 
  sorted by, 
  * best, 
  * top, 
  * new, 
  * controversial, 
  * old, 
  the theory goes : if you let the military run the war , you may soon find the military running the country . 
  that strongly implies that the best route is to get stats at 9 , 10 , 12 and 13 , which means only skilling 1 point into q ( for the move speed ) . 
  12 months `` check if thatguyyouhate666 has eaten his nads or not '', 
  [ same in australia ] ( http://www.bountybags.com.au/ ) . 
  like , it 's not * bad * , but it 's not exactly `` instant newborn survival kit '' like the finns have . 
  that 's not what it says . 
  do n't forget a casual raindrop to soak up burst magic and give you a small amount of mana regen until it evaporates . 
  up to 120 magic , 5 times . 
  this explains a lot about my life . 
  starting ? 
  `` snail of discord '', 
  i love it . 
  ah , now it makes sense . 
  yes , and it happens before the ` illusions take 4x the damage ' step , so it makes a big difference to their survivability . 
  not a hard counter . 
  you pounce through his illusions but he can doppelganger out of pounce and it 's hard to get stacks after that . 
  plus , slark is unhappy having mana drained . 
  why not allow opening the chat wheel on the mini map ? 
  kinda , yeah . 
  we learned yesterday that autoexec binds to do multiple things ( like toggle armlet or separate binds for ` self-cast x spell ' ) [ are disallowed ] ( https://twitter.com/cyborgmatt/status/735007761470226432 ) at manila major . 
  this update extends that to everyone . 
  i wonder how many people will be affected - i have n't been playing long , but even i have a key binding that turns on/off open mic and plays a sound effect , which appears to be a cheat now ;(, 
  they could call the site, 
  and rebrand it a bit i guess . 
  does it have a semicolon ? 
  if ` yes ` , you are ` shit outta luck `, 
  until you posted , i never knew i wanted this so much . 
  you can stop invoker scripts easily - just add a cast point on qas , wex and exort . 
  even before the change , as soon as a keybinding encountered something with a cast point , it would stop processing other commands . 
  is there one in ` / game/cfg ` ? 
  anything with a semicolon wo n't work . 
   toggle openmic, 
  would this work ? 
  ` bind '' / '' `` toggle voice_vox 0 1 '' `, 
  does the toggle command work at all ? 
  well , the $ 500k is negotiable . 
  if you rock up with any six-figure sum to invest , they 'll at least consider allowing you into the wholesale fund . 
  so , toggling open mic is, 
  ` bind '' / '' `` incrementvar voice_vox 0 1 1 '' `, 
  or has the var changed as well ? 
  but i want hero specific smart cast ... 
  hence why smart-cast bindings per ability per hero are needed . 
  if it has a semicolon , chances are it wo n't work . 
  either bottle or soul ring are necessary for off lane lc . 
  edit : or cm/kotl , 
  imo , it 's not about timing the market , as about keeping ratios . 
  imagine you have a 20/40/40 split of au/us/euro indexes . 
  but , your ratio a year later fy might be 28/36/36 . 
  why ? 
  maybe au went well . 
  maybe us and euro did n't . 
  ~ ~ maybe fuck you . ~ ~ maybe it does n't really matter because you have chosen not to time the market . 
  either way , rebalancing means either putting extra funds into us and eu until the ratio is back to normal , or selling off some au , or a mixture according to your financial position . 
  end result : at the end of any rebalance , you have used dollar cost averaging to invest according to rules that do n't involve timing the market . 
  scenario : 4 lane creeps + 1 hero going for a last hit :, 
  scenario : 4 lane creeps + 2 heroes :, 
  oo cares more about extra heroes ( +65 ) than creeps ( +20 ), 
  es is a flat +40 for each target . 
  but yeah , oo and es are in the same ballpark if you can catch 2 heroes . 
  the problem with clearing stacks with oo is the magic-resist creeps . 
  that , coupled with the long cooldown on oo means a dedicated jungler is often better off wading in with high levels of moc and clearing them that way - high levels of moc only really make a difference when there is a huge amount of things hitting you at once . 
  it 's not 2000 damage , it 's twenty instances of damage ... 
  each instance must be 100 + magic/pure , so no . 
  level 1 pulse nova = 100 magic damage . 
  so 3 enemies x 7 seconds = 21 instances, 
  also lightning storm level 2 + also counts . 
  oh really ? 
  perhaps you can post that to / r/todayilearned i 'm * sure * they 'd appreciate it . 
  so , i take it the ` alias ` command is also now a cheat ? 
  well , that 's disappointing .
