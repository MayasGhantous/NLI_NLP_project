  it was more of an apc , really . 
  why would you ever think that singapore was a third world country ? 
  maybe in the 1950s , but not since . 
  top 10 % is still bad though . 
   so i was thking 37 % international , 37 % australian , 26 % bond . 
  leaving aside the bonds , that 's a 50/50 split between au and international investment . 
  given that australia is , generously , 3 % of the world 's economy , do you plan to keep rebalancing to 50/50 , or just start with 50/50 and transition to a different ratio over time ? 
  probably better with a mkb , since that 's something that gyro is more likely to buy regardless . 
  that seems a bit high . 
  i would expect ~ 20k . 
   a single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression , the letter t as a delimiter , and a valid time expression . 
  for example , `` 2007-04-05t14 :30 '' . 
  omitting the t is not standard , even though many parsers cope . 
  does she still have his laptop with the draft of his next novel ? 
  that 's because it 's fucking hard to get into australia unless you already have a job waiting for you when you step off the plane . 
  that 's ... not very red at all . 
  so basically , american beauty . 
  why not ? 
  if they had the ability to blackmail a senator to change their vote , why lose their leverage by making it public ? 
  i think you do n't give them enough credit when it comes to self control vs self interest . 
   update : a gold coast toddler who was taken yesterday from mudgeeraba on the gold coast has been found safe and well . 
   more to come . 
  there 's not much you can do about reaction times , except, 
  * play to your strengths . 
  that means stay away from heroes that need good reaction times to survive ( puck etc ) , or absurd apm . 
  instead , gravitate towards heroes that can have an impact via positioning or planning instead . 
  roaming riki/bh is not about reflexes - it 's more about being in the right place at the right time . 
  * shore up your weaknesses by planning your movements . 
  if you want to initiate , work out ahead of time exactly what you want to do , so `` armlet + blademail + blink + duel '' becomes 1 thought ( ` press zxcr ' ) rather than 4 separate decisions that take up scarce mental resources . 
  * you do n't need fast reaction times to communicate and plan with your team . 
  you do n't have to be the only guy on your team that does this , but you need to step up if nobody else does . 
  i 'd rather have satanic to heal up immediately after duelling . 
  medallion ? 
  desolator ? 
   so did the guy deliberately add methylated spirits to homebrew ? 
  or accidentally added it , thinking it was straight ethanol ? 
  apparently he neglected to label the bottles and used the wrong one . 
  but some currencies have thousandths rather than hundredths ... 
  i think everyone knows you should get a value point once you have farmed your shadow blade , for the move speed buff . 
  young , dumb , and full of c. ... oal . 
  when it comes down to it , it does n't matter how cheap someone is , if they can only do the easiest 50 % of what the job entails . 
  prolefuckingtariat rules ey . 
   the hooters next to the wharf . 
  that location can not be accidental . 
  there needs to be an uber/airbnb style rating system for landlords . 
  this happened to me last year . 
  i logged onto my gov and authorised my super to pay the extra tax . 
   except skin colour, 
  speak for yourself . 
   i find the term ` trickle-down ' is insulting when applied in an economic sense, 
  well , it was * meant * to be an insult when the term was coined in the 1930s , so , well done ? 
  i prefer to be called ` pre-tanned ', 
  reaganomics was a slang term , just like obamacare . 
  the ` correct ' term was supply-side economics , which was basically trickle-down with a new coat of paint anyway . 
  not scared ; more dubious about the entire process . 
  from a game theory standpoint , paying people smugglers to burn their boats just makes boom times in their boatbuilding industry . 
  from a human rights standpoint , it does n't sit well for me that we lock up kids etc just to ` be strong on boat people ' or ` provide a deterrent ' . 
  they 've already risked their lives to get here ; they 're clearly not fucking about . 
  from an economic standpoint , fuck serco and fuck the large buckets of taxpayer money they 're extracting from us for their bullshit . 
  from a security point of view , what 's wrong with doing what we did with vietnamese refugees ? 
  the world has n't changed that much - refugees will still have ptsd and social issues , but you just fucking deal with it instead of this concentration camp bullshit . 
  from a public relations point of view , the whole thing has been handled badly . 
  in short , the whole thing is a hot mess , and i want the government to either, 
  * admit that australia is full of complete cunts and own it , or, 
  * not act like complete cunts . 
   just please , please please , mention something to me before you take any cs . 
  it 's not even difficult . 
  alt-click the item in your quickbuy and it will notify your team you need x gold until you can afford to buy it . 
  barely, 
  it does have some niche uses - if you have an mkb , you can mini-stun while you 're disabled ( good if pudge is eating your face ), 
  well , monoxide binds to haemoglobin more strongly , so there 's a bit of a difference . 
  if you inhale a lungful of monoxide , the red blood cells that are affected are basically useless until they die a few months later . 
  he also works well in a strength hero meta , since he just keep hitting faster the more hit points they have . 
  troll benefits from the buff to sange and yasha though . 
  any games from manila that you recommend watching for terror blade play ? 
  til , i thought it was much longer . 
  internet spaceships is serious business . 
  even itsy bitsy spiders have a waterspout meant for them . 
  i 'm currently winning eve but i 've been mostly hanging out in drone walker space , and before that , syndicate . 
  i compiled a small list :, 
  ### manila major, 
  * ub1 : lgd vs fnatic ( # 2 ) jun 8, 
  * lb2 : dc vs vg ( # 3 ) jun 9, 
  * lb5 tl vs lgd ( # 2 ) jun 11 ( loss ), 
  group stage :, 
  * a vs fanatic ( [ # 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgphgtwexom&amp;t=10m27s ) , [ # 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0giuedd39s8&amp;t=7m44s ) ) 17jun, 
  * vega vs a ( [ # 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gyyl_hbuvy&amp;t=12m11s ) ) 17jun, 
  * og vs navi ( [ # 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghtt1e4v9ug&amp;t=12m5s ) ) 17 jun, 
  * og vs col ( [ # 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifvtzdum2j4&amp;t=8m48s ) ) 17jun, 
  just watch their game and see . 
  why not both ? 
   not much the employers can do about it, 
  til minimum wage = maximum wage, 
  basher has a cooldown . 
  mkb and troll do not . 
   the west has , for the most part , gotten their act together, 
  not australia . 
  we had a tax on carbon , and renewable energy schemes to reduce the need for more ( coal ) power stations . 
  then we elected some conservatives and they cancelled them all . 
  welp .
