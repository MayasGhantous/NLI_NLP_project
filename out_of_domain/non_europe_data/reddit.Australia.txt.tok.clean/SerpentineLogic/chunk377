  surely after a certain point you buy a gem or necro 3 ? 
   should we be worried about what the australians want, 
  our demands are :, 
  * all the leading man roles in hollywood movies, 
  * free trade agreement and removal of steam games tariffs, 
  * you mob learn to make a fucken flat white, 
  * stop making upside down jokes, 
  you ca n't even talk properly . 
  i said * tourist * . 
   it is super hard to stack , but i do n't think anything changed . 
  a few patches ago , the vertical limit to spawn boxes was removed , so stacking via lifting creeps upwards does n't work any more . 
  mandarin , shanghainese , hokkien , cantonese - the only reason they 're called dialects instead of different languages is politics . 
  i note that wikipedia is careful to call them [ varieties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_varieties_of_chinese ) . 
  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code-switching] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code-switching#examples ), 
  perhaps they just do n't want to wear the fallout when this inevitably turns ugly . 
  perhaps this was beyond even their limits . 
  the biggest things ? 
  * a decent deposit, 
  * being able to afford the repayments, 
  they do have ads again . 
  they 're working on it : https://github.com/yasp-dota/ui, 
  it 's just slow , and it 's a big job , and you need a decent amount of talent to make it awesome rather than just okay . 
  i do n't know why you 're being downvoted so hard . 
  parsing thousands of replays per day uses a lot of ( cloud ) computing power - it 's entirely possible that some optimisation work could be done that saves them 10 % off their monthly bills . 
  it might not even be coding-related , but billing/purchasing optimisations , or leaning more heavily on cheap at-will cpu hours etc. 
  this is a valid point . 
  been there , done that , [ got the t-shirt ] ( https://threddit.com/5970 ) . 
  first , explain to us what you see the position 4 's role to be , and what kind of things you do in the early , mid and late game . 
  i think it 's now an advanced setting you can enable in options . 
  amazon, 
  user name checks out, 
  went up 4 levels ; not bad i guess . 
  that 's not an incompatible belief . 
  `` j\u00e1 , i do n't believe in a god , but i do believe in moose , polar bears , penguins , volcanoes and elves ; that 's totally different because those things exist in the world . '', 
  * bind ` push now ' to chat wheel or keybind, 
  * have an urn or mek for sustain after winning a teamfight, 
  * ward behind the objective you want to take, 
  * actually initiate the push ( np is good for this , since it 's pretty obvious what you 're doing , and you have the tools for it ), 
  * if you ca n't initiate , alt-click your push skill ( like shadow shaman 's ult ) to give your team a hint that you 're ready . 
  hopefully they show up on ~ ~ / r/dota2vods ~ ~ er , / r/dotavods soon . 
  i 'm pretty sure gambling companies are n't hurting for money . 
  holy roaming empire ? 
  all chat phrases that can be bound to the wheel or keyboard have translations . 
  sounds difficult . 
  you might need to hook up an extra keyboard . 
  i see you 've played ncisy-spoony before . 
  hex u. 
  to be fair , those guys are pretty good . 
  settle down , mister wonka . 
  hey , at least they 're keeping it plausible . 
  i 'm still murky on how lowering corporate tax rates somehow stimulates demand . 
  that 's not the corporate tax rate , unless you 're the owner of a business . 
  that does not make sense to me . 
  companies with less tax just make more profit . 
  hiring more staff is a reaction to needing more stuff to sell customers , which is driven by demand . 
  tinkering with company tax rates is like replacing the tail pipe with a chrome one , hoping it will fix your broken starter motor . 
  if the alternative is that nobody uses scan , why not ? 
  plus it 's paid . 
  i think i spent every christmas break on site , even after i fulfilled my 90 days requirement , just for the money . 
  i 'm still dirty that they did n't teach us about laplace transforms until 3rd year or so . 
  it 's * pretty good * being able to solve circuit diagrams in your head . 
  dude , he 's trolling . 
  personally , i find that incentives to login actually make me login less . 
  perhaps i 'm just perverse that way . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ reserve ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ perverse ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ ways, 
  first year is shared between all engineering disciplines . 
  second year is fourier first . 
  only after you have felt the pain is laplace introduced . 
  i do n't share your opinion but i 'm glad you posted your view on this subject . 
  i have a key bound to, 
  * my hero, 
  * me plus summons, 
  * summons only, 
  it 's quite convenient sometimes to select summons and send them down a lane while you farm jungle . 
  they probably already have an iron talon . 
  they can get battle fury to replace that late game i guess . 
  yes that 's why silencer like it , since he has an ability that gives vision while he right clicks like a truck . 
  both systems can coexist . 
  single payer for most stuff , and you get private health insurance for extras like choice of doctors , private rooms , skipping to the front of the waiting list for elective surgery ( knee reconstruction etc ) , free set of track shoes or discounted gym membership or massages ; basically whatever cool things a company can offer to differentiate themselves beyond the actual provision of medical care . 
  if those new people do n't spend money at your business , then it 's all down side . 
  we have single payer for prescription drugs , too . 
  it helps * a lot * . 
  the aca does n't affect you much if you are young , healthy and have a stable job . 
  if you do n't meet all three criteria , you are likely much better off compared to otherwise . 
  is this a actual commonwealth thing , or just white people commonwealth ? 
  immortal 1 maybe , but i doubt immortal 2 or 3 will be so cheap . 
  or maybe britain will split and bits will rejoin the eu, 
  it 's always the children who suffer the most during a break up . 
  pretty sure there 's maximum quotas to stop that . 
  so just wipe the server . 
  like , with a cloth . 
  irish reunification ? 
  what a time to be alive . 
  i meant across the population . 
  most people only get immortal 1s, 
  you can enable the setting for quick cast on key up , so you see the target circle . 
  however you ca n't do this on a per hero or per ability basis . 
  when your entire population is lactose-intolerant , how else would you get your calcium ? 
  you 'd have better luck getting a beef curry in an indian restaurant . 
  what 's wrong with puns about indigenous grub ?
