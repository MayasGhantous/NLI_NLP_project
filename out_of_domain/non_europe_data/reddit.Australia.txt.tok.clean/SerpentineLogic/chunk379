  welp . 
  it also predicted six of the last two economic downturns ... 
  throw enough predictions at the wall - some of them will stick . 
  should have been milk . 
  the irritant in chili is soluble in oil , so milk fats will work . 
  go for a year or two . 
  what do you have to lose ? 
  you 're probably right , but it 's impolite to mention it . 
  is there a way to bind auto-cast to a key in auto exec , or is it just via options menu ? 
  there 's an [ app for that ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/article/iceland-incest-app ) though . 
  also , tiny really likes the mana wisp provides ( usually wisp carries the bottle in a tiny wisp dual mid situation ), 
  yes . 
  why would anything have changed ? 
  nice . 
  glad you like it, 
  oh , you 'd prefer not knowing where it was ? 
  why would n't it ? 
  from my experience , hard bots are around 1k mmr play so they 're kinda the skill floor of ranked . 
  it was the building industry commission , with carefully worded powers to investigate unions in previously illegal ways . 
  the senate was right to reject it , and this gave malcolm the grounds to call a double dissolution election . 
  software engineering is a larger discipline than just programming , much like glass-blowing is more than ` just turning a hot glass rod ' . 
  you can still click on the shop keeper in the fountain , right ? 
  it 's only 1/3 filled when you buy it though . 
  not for the next year , no - the electorate will likely punish them for being sooks . 
  after that , all bets are off . 
  they 'll probably keep a bill like the abcc up their sleeve for a dd trigger , then see if there 's a good political climate in the next 2 years to play it . 
  if not , i guess they do it the normal way and try to win the next election with better margins . 
  you want it all but you ca n't have it, 
  it 's randomised before each election . 
  on average , it evens out . 
  qr should do another ad campaign . 
  `` getting elected . 
  it 's super secular stuff '', 
  maybe she 's born with it . 
  maybe it 's midichlorians . 
  [ o ] k, 
  look at the prize pool . 
  if you even * get into * a major , you 're guaranteed to get $ 34k . 
  note : they pay money even for the qualifying matches , and those payouts , while low , we 're doubled compared to last year . 
  even in 1 . x k , the team that uses voice will win more often . 
  and then of course you need to do it during election day , too , or else someone sneaks in their own firmware during morning tea and removes it in the afternoon so it passes the end of day audit . 
  linkens sphere . 
  i put my mmr on yasp as a warning , not a brag . 
  no , alcoholics write reddit comments about flesh interfaces . 
  she was signed on for ep 8 though ... 
  technically , the choice here is only between, 
  * some guilty people stay in jail instead of being killed by the state, 
  * some innocent people are killed by the state, 
  life 514, 
  rookie mistake ; that just tests whether you 're venomous . 
  to check whether you are poisonous , people have to bite * you * . 
  hope that helps . 
  well , i suppose you could just use utc wherever you live , like we do in eve online . 
  press the attack = red bull, 
  bribe someone on your team to go alchemist so you can purge self stuns off him . 
  you only get to tip him if your side wins , so he only gets the reward if you complete the quest . 
  dazzle , wyvern , bane , sd , others who can interrupt the duel . 
  stuns and disarms also work , until she has bkb . 
  still , 2 levels is like 85c , so if you can get more than that for an immortal , go for it . 
  if an lc is bad enough not to blade mail before duelling a troll , you wo n't have a problem killing them anyway . 
  the preceding short comment is unsigned . 
  nuffin, 
  still waiting for the custom iron talon skin ... 
  scratching his balls ? 
  that was only a winter battle pass thing . 
  never play eve online , then . 
  eve online has the most robust player-run economy of an mmorpg . 
  they have an in-house economist team so it 's [ pretty important to them ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/4riv1y/dev_blog_monthly_economic_report_june_2016_ccp/ ) . 
  exchanging it for rl currency is forbidden though - the game developer does not want to fall under eu monetary/banking laws , so money only goes into the game ; never out . 
  there are , however , people rich enough in eve to pay for * hundreds * of years worth of subscription time using their in-game currency reserves . 
  well , wedding rings have been a thing for centuries . 
  de beers resurrected the concept of a ( diamond ) engagement ring though . 
  i wonder if the quest accumulates faster if you buy a casual morbid mask . 
  that 's the calibre of comment i expected from this thread . 
  if you screw up the oo against the stack ( usually due to too many magic resist creeps ) then it 's worse than a 3-1-2-1 build . 
  the second level in her passive makes a real difference in sustain . 
  use soul ring , nuke them for zero mana cost . 
  next time , use soul ring , heal yourself * and * nuke them , for only 60 mana ( less if you tread switch ), 
  * strength when you activate it ( so -150 hp is a smaller percentage of your health , and +150 mana is a bigger proportion ), 
  * int when you cast spells , so each cast is a smaller proportion of your total, 
  not sure whether there 's an optimal setting for when the soul ring ends ; probably still int though . 
  us government is bankrolling it too . 
  that 's interesting , since one of the recent experimental treatments involves opening the blood brain barrier with ultrasound to let in cells to clear out plaques until the barrier closes a few hours later . 
  i guess we 'll soon find out if it makes the disease better or worse ... 
  begun , the uplift war has . 
  it 's past due . 
  ccp games banned gambling sites access to their apis for a long time , and that even includes the ones that never deal with rl currency . 
  shame, 
  shame, 
  shame, 
  it works . 
  so you 'd know that if somer cashed out all their in-game proceeds of blink , they 'd be a millionaire , maybe many times over . 
  people hack games just to get higher on the leaderboard * of a video game * . 
  imagine the dirty shit that would happen when that kind of rl money is on the line . 
  looks like the eve valkyrie devs knew what was up . 
  i can just imagine him walking into sixes and sevens or albert & constance [ ... ] ( http://huckcdn.lwlies.com/admin/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chum-01.jpg ), 
  it should be modelled off the beer market . 
  * mass-market beer that is relatively cheap and 100 % consistent, 
  * craft beer produced by local ( licensed ) businesses for unusual/better stuff , but cost more per unit . 
  * home brewers that produce cheaper/more inconsistent product for recreational use , but are not licensed to sell .
