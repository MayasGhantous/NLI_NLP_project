  the next day , you 're * their * alt . 
  perhaps you did n't pick up on the subtlety of their insults . 
  `` oh , no need to stand on ceremony here . '', 
  ^ ( gaijin are n't expected to have manners ), 
  `` your japanese is very good '' ^ ( all things considered ), 
  see : [ articulate ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-mills/obama-the-articulate_b_39919.html ), 
  something similar to [ this ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) would work . 
  de-pimp to taste . 
  because why ? 
  we 're happy to offer advice on specific questions you may have , particularly about ship fittings , where we will squabble and rage like petulant schoolboys , as is our wont . 
  for more generic questions and tips , we have a wide selection of links on the sidebar , and because it gets asked a lot , here 's a post about [ combat 101 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) i prepared earlier . 
  perhaps she 's just inefficient at metabolising and storing food . 
  u use angry words = = u mad, 
  the first hypocaust deniers emerged a few years later . 
  lmao, 
  i thought pepper spray was only supposed to be used as a non-lethal alternative to a ** gun ** . 
  someone coming at you with a knife ? 
  sure , use pepper spray , because if you did n't have it , you 'd certainly be using a gun . 
  twelve year old girl trying to wrestle you to the ground ? 
  you would n't shoot them , so you should n't spray them . 
  speaking as a complete stranger , i wish you did , too . 
  i get enough blatant market manipulation attempts in eve . 
  i 'd prefer not to see them on reddit as well . 
  ** [ aura ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aideronrobotics.android.aura&amp;hl=en ) ** has a fitting tool , but i have been slack and have n't cross-ported pyfa yet . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but where i went to college , civil engineers had to do three entire subjects devoted to concrete . 
  apparently , it 's a * tiny bit * more involved than mixing sand and cement and hoping for the best . 
  hazel ( and green ) eyes are the result of multiple genes . 
  i have hazel eyes . 
  my wife ( along with all her family for generations ) has brown eyes . 
  my kids have hazel eyes - not possible if it was a mutation of the blue-eyed gene . 
  ofc they have to re-enroll every year ... 
  in the usa , surprisingly about the same rarity . 
  blue eye distribution varies by country , being 99 % in estonia , 75 % in germany , and the us falling from 33 % to 16 % over the last fifty years . 
  in contrast , green/hazel eyes top out at 16 % in the us but generally localised to people of celtic descent . 
  they 've changed the course wildly since last century , whichw as the last time i looked . 
  still , some obvious courses stand out :, 
  * [ reinforced concrete structures & concrete technology ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=civl2360 ), 
  * [ geotechnical engineering ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=civl3210 ), 
  * [ structural design ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=civl3350 ), 
  it 's 3am on a normal tuesday night . 
  suddenly , the telephones in every pizza parlor in the world start ringing . 
  ever . 
  ah , the [ mister bearington ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xyqil.jpg ) maneouvre . 
  did he get ten seconds of crits ? 
  what 's the deal with that , anyway ? 
  no ; i 'm an aura contributor . 
  i 've been meaning to port the [ latest rewrite ] ( https://github.com/darkfenx/eos ) of pyfa to an android [ library ] ( https://github.com/jparks/aura ) so it can be used inside aura , but rl has intruded lately . 
   have an industry alt looking for some free bpos, 
  fyp, 
  all breeds of koalas have incredibly strong arms from holding themselves vertical on trees all day . 
  you do n't want to know how badly a drop bear will fuck you up if it lands on you . 
  cane toads are poisonous . 
  rabbits do n't live in forested areas . 
  ps the cerebral accelerator sells for a fair bit of in-game isk , so you may find it more worthwhile to sell it via contracts and use the income to buy some ` real ' attribute implants ( +3 or +4 attribute enhancers ) instead . 
  but that would invulv expending effort . 
  i guess it was a pretty small indy corp. 
  then again , the big ones know how to lock down bpos , 
  less probes is always sub-optimal , unless you ca n't afford the time to launch them in a combat situation . 
  for all other situations , learn to hold shift or alt when moving probes . 
  post eveboard link . 
  your character is probably salvageable . 
  til that people exist who first learned of john cleese from fable . 
  the point is n't to run pyfa . 
  the point is to port pyfa to java and thus use it in aura . 
  it would be helpful if we knew the password ~, 
  it 's not a * hard * price floor because existing research and development agents still supply them ` for free ' . 
  personally i would have gone for interplanetary consolidation v first . 
  after all , 6 planets vs 5 is a flat 20 % increase in production . 
  you 're unlikely to get 20 % more production with a bit more grid or cpu . 
  i looked at your eveboard link and while there 's a lot of room for improvement , you 'll have no problems transitioning to a combat focus if you wanted . 
  keep using the planetary interaction skills , since they will be a good source of income and , well , you 've already sunk the skillpoints into them . 
  just bear in mind that your actual combat-useful skills only total 1.04 million sp , i.e. 
  about 25 days training time . 
  as far as what to train , train for tech 2 medium projectiles , battlecruiser v , and whatever you need to fit a tech 2 shield tank . 
  but after that it 's free . 
  if you 're worried , cash them all out now ? 
  10k wo n't break the bank . 
  '' [ never be ashamed of who you are ] ( http://media.screened.com/uploads/0/47/568899-568786_fifthelement_zorg.png ) '', 
  this is true - if your faction is doing well , you get discounts to your lp store . 
  r&d agents are generally only worth it if you were going to train most of the skills anyway . 
  otherwise , pi or trading is a better eay to make a cash-generating alt . 
  i suspect it will involve the [ ammatar mandate ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/ammatar_mandate ) . 
   you should n't be rewarded for stacking up skills and disappearing for a month . 
  not logging in is its own reward . 
  yes . 
  there 's no penalty for using them then undocking though . 
  if you want to get a good , flexible attribute spread :, 
  * maximum intelligence, 
  * the rest into perception, 
  this will get the remap cooldown timer ticking over . 
  you will train mostly support skills for the first few months , but will have enough perception to train useful combat skills . 
  after your support ( and navigation ) skills are acceptable , you can remap to, 
  * max perception, 
  * rest willpower, 
  because you can easily spend an entire year training combat skills . 
  if you * really * want to optimise , then instead go full int/mem for 6 months + doing support skills , then per/will , but those first six months will be pretty painful . 
  or bank accounts . 
  if you do n't need any of the other items , why not ? 
  after all , you 'd be a fool to sell it for less than the most-expensive gift pack ( the +4 implants , worth about 40m isk ) . 
  sence .
