  i have seen pros jungle lc but only get a value point in her q. 
  that explains the smell . 
  in the us , it 's more like, 
  * your employer pays them when you work, 
  ^ if ^ you ^ do n't ^ work , ^ you 're ^ fucked, 
  * they try * not * to pay the hospital when you are sick, 
  he should watch his tone !, 
  it is handled at a state level , by state-specific exchanges and companies . 
  all the aca act says is `` all states * must * handle it '' . 
  that 's also why i support the do not call phone register . 
  it 's not just about avoiding the hassle of being called by telemarketers ; it 's crucial to protect people do n't * want * this crap , but who know they are easy to pressure into buying something once they pick up . 
  state capitalism . 
  i think life steal only counts if you are on less than maximum health when it procs . 
  maybe try armlet build ? 
  i guess you 're both hopeful for that vaccine that 's on the news , then . 
  70 % of the size of us west still seems pretty decent though . 
  hillary being loose with the truth ? 
  well i never . 
  sauce ? 
  he ran so fast he left skid marks . 
  if you pull at :53 the camp will stack . 
  that will clear the wave . 
  saw [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/0rtl5 ) yesterday , it was enlightening . 
  i double click the item slot . 
  did n't last long . 
  either it was poorly-organised and failed , or it was initiated by erdogan as a false flag operation and an excuse to purge the military of moderates . 
  either way , turkey is fairly fucked . 
  yes , i have two quick cast slots , and often put wards in one of them . 
  china is already investing billions in the new african teenagers next door . 
  faster to place , especially when chasing , and faster to panic escape - just press a single key . 
  having a casual urn as a support is really underrated . 
  after a team fight , you might have 2 cores on low health . 
  using urn charges to get them back to full is usually key to convincing them to take a tower immediately . 
  another thing that helps pushing is creep cutting behind a tower , even if you ca n't take one on yourself . 
  whose responsibility is it that the supplier 's goods are to spec ? 
  john holland . 
  trickle down, 
  i see what you did there . 
  it showed `` offline mode '' at the top once i got out of my most recent game . 
  i heard it was ~ 30k or so . 
  of course , that might * just * be for surrogacy , rather than prepping the embryo , hospital stay etc. 
  both have remote pulls , so there 's that . 
  you 'll be first against the wall , come the revolution . 
  so i guess a good halal snack pack is out of the question ? 
   we 're for the most part a pretty welcoming country, 
  unless , and this is critical , you came here * by boat * . 
  assuming the coup was actually legit , why not both ? 
  they 're intertwined . 
  `` it was just a prank , bro '', 
  i feel you , keenly . 
   nobody gets killed in jousting accidents . 
  clearly you have n't read the dunk and egg prequels . 
   asoiaf is pretty much a deconstruction of classic good vs evil fantasy . 
  * the first law * trilogy is a more comprehensive deconstruction . 
  in fact , the entire conservative mind set is `` i 'd rather stay put than go in the wrong direction '', 
  eagle boys was the first competition to pizza hut our town ever had . 
  before that , a single large pizza was $ 24 . 
  this was , i dunno , late 80s ? 
  $ 24 in those days was like 70 now . 
  * it 's not a competition *, 
  they were n't shy about it either . 
  there was a case of a [ political agitator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attempted_exclusion_of_egon_kisch_from_australia ) that australia did n't want to let in . 
  so , they tested his literacy in more and more obscure european languages until he failed . 
   the federal government now attempted to exclude kisch using the immigration restriction act . 
  the act provided that `` any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a european language directed by the officer '' would not be admitted . 
   this was primarily intended , and used , as a means to exclude non-whites from entering australia under the white australia policy , but it could be , and occasionally was , used to exclude other undesirables . 
  kisch demonstrated his fluency in a number of european languages , and he was then asked to write the lord 's prayer in scottish gaelic . 
  he refused to participate and was deemed to have failed the test . 
  he was then taken into custody , this time by the new south wales police , who released him on au # 200 bail . 
   the dictation test was also used to exclude another anti-war activist who had been invited to speak . 
  irishman ( and therefore british subject ) gerald griffin , had been given a dictation test in dutch , which he had failed as he was meant to do . 
  still above 75 % . 
  might be prudent to get some of your family 's money out of the country . 
  currency controls are common when things start spiralling out of control . 
  having access to paper euros or us dollars when your family leaves might also be a good idea .

  [ apropos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyyt2jmvpak ) , but even then , there 's regional quirks - you can tell the difference between north london and south london accents . 
  luna is basically a ranged , squishy sven , so yeah . 
  realistically , you can get 40 or 50 levels by playing . 
  probably still worth getting the level 1 compendium though . 
  it has a lot of stuff for $ 8 . 
  usually we buy singles or entire cartons , but 6 packs are available for many beers . 
  the main benefit of private schools is that they kick out disruptive students . 
  anything else is secondary . 
  ok cupid did analytics on that subject . 
  tldr nobody wants black women or asian men . 
  i think you 'd be surprised . 
  you 're welcome to dispute their data or findings . 
  i 'd rather see co2 sequestration into soil . 
  australia has , on average , very low soil carbon levels , which impacts its fertility . 
  so , a ranged anti mage . 
  you guys are in violent agreement . 
  meme level : vintage, 
  should just be / / for protocol relative url . 
  til, 
  perhaps it would be prudent to send those guys on a 1-week vacation to the us , just to prep the visa process for next time and prove they wo n't elope . 
  i find emu too gamey and oily . 
  camel is nice though .
