  cheap interest means more borrowing means people can afford more expensive houses . 
  perhaps they gave out a licence instead , as is usual . 
  no , splitting is when you get creep aggro to draw the melee creeps around yours so they attack your ranged creep . 
  creep blocking is what you do if there 's no creeps around . 
  / r/learndota2 used to be frequented by azual , of [ know your enemy ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/p/know-your-enemy.html ) fame . 
  ... and that 's all , folks . 
  he 's 18 ? 
  cool . 
  * http://www.uqu.com.au/uqu-queer-collective, 
  * https://www.qut.edu.au/study/student-life/student-support/lgbtiq-support, 
  i 'd contact some reps from the various queer collectives and see if he can turn up at some events to see what it 's like . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 'd be cool with that . 
  the rejected generation, 
  well , you * can * buy a standing desk . 
  vlads works if there 's nobody else to carry one ( and you can disassemble aquila ) but a late game progression is more often helm into satanic . 
  it does , sadly . 
  there 's two things that correlate strongly with anti-vax :, 
  * belief in astrology . 
  * `` natural medicine only , please '' *, 
  * a phd, 
  * `` i 'm smarter than most people , so i 'm definitely smarter than doctors '' *, 
  if a school tests you , to place you in remedial maths , maths a or maths b , then it should equally be allowed to test you for placement in esl chinese , esl advanced chinese , or native chinese subjects . 
   chinese is offered at three levels in the vce -- chinese as a first language , chinese as a second language and chinese as a second language advanced . 
  so , they * already have * a separate qualification available - they just do n't get to slum it in the esl level . 
  he leaves that to the position 5 treant . 
  or more likely , the dod told him that ufos and aliens were a useful smokescreen for military research projects , and disclosing too much would impair operational security . 
  old yeller . 
  it has a certain ring to it . 
  do n't dismiss foetal alcohol syndrome and other things that cause mental health issues ( like chroming ) . 
  it 's a massive problem because, 
  * it ca n't be solved by sequestration in rehab, 
  * it robs kids of their future, 
  there are programs to help kids with fas , but they 're chronically under funded and the problem is so wide spread that throwing money at the problem is just not feasible . 
  he 's just edging . 
  it 's probably more like 2 years rather than 2.5 . 
  i thought you only get assist gold if you 're in aoe . 
  shitty wild-ass guess ? 
  soul ring is useless for healing . 
  however , it allows you to use cask for zero net mana cost . 
  you can then heal yourself while you 're healing your carry . 
  toy guns are legal tho . 
  esports competitors used athlete visas to get to ti6 this year . 
  with a $ 20m prize pool , it 's serious business . 
  some people did n't get visas approved though , probably because it was their first time in the usa and they came from high risk countries .

  having said that , game 1 was also good ; exc 's earth spirit was wrecking things . 
  it 's almost as if they realised that too many ads are actually a net negative for the entire event . 
  reference to the original movie :, 
  this guy is full stack . 
  indonesia , probably, 
  that 's because we 're the plucky little brother when it comes to rugby, 
  well , we do have commonwealth solidarity, 
  why not start off the way you intend to continue , but buy in tranches ? 
  like , buy one etf with 2000 dollars . 
  then buy the second one with 2000 dollars . 
  then save up until you have 2000 for the third . 
  there 's a train of thought that stuff like this happens to other countries , but they do n't publicise it , because they understand that it 's likely to damage relations with brazil , or hurt their chances at hosting future olympic events . 
  australians apparently just do n't give a shit about that . 
  of * course * they end up a financial loss ( or have profit margins that represent a terrible return on investment ) . 
  the olympics games are an * excuse to spend * . 
  spend on stadiums . 
  spend on bulldozing a city centre and redeveloping it . 
  spend on marketing . 
  spend on gigantic parties . 
  leaving aside whether various countries can afford it , if they prioritise the expense they are welcome to compete for a future olympics , * just * like they 're welcome to blow that money on high-speed rail or free hotdogs or whatever else they want . 
  it 's not a fucking competition , guys, 
  enough to damage that you always kill someone when you duel them . 
  email or call them . 
  i mean , if there 's one thing that customer service loves to do , it 's help you * become * their customer . 
  as does australia . 
  more accurately , it 's `` more skill per dollar '' . 
  a fresh grad can do maybe 20 % of the job . 
  they have no experience , and need money sunk into training , so they 're actually a net cost to the business until they skill up . 
  an offshore developer can do , arguably , 80 % of the job . 
  but , they cost $ 27000 per year , and you can get rid of them without paying redundancy packages . 
  an experienced consultant or in-house senior developer can do 100 % of the job , but ... 
  * contractors are expensive, 
  * in-house developers are rare , not least because you have n't hired grads in the last ten years . 
  so you see offshoring crowding out the job pool for the low/mid end of the town , to the long-term detriment of business . 
  rip my predictions, 
  have you considered checking government departments ? 
  i suspect families and corrections have quite a few psych employees , both for customers and for staff . 
  no veil ? 
  * adds tank ( 120hp + 6 armor + 6 regen ), 
  * +18 damage for int heroes, 
  * useful damage amp for q , r and your teammates ' spells . 
   you ca n't even tell if someone is experienced , when all there references are based in india or china . 
  no one is following that up . 
  pro tip : if you offshore without * thoroughly * vetting the people you hire , you have played yourself . 
  you 'll soon be in the situation where your offshore team can only handle the easiest 70 % of the job , meaning the hard bits either, 
  * do n't get resolved , in which case you 're fucked , or, 
  * you have to hire someone expensive ( either onshore or offshore ) to fix their fuckups , in which case your projected cost savings evaporate . 
  there is a case to be made for 30 * decent * offshore developers and 3 top-notch onshore developers to ride herd on them , but if you do n't winnow out the bad apples in that 30 , you wo n't be successful . 
  code academy , going to meetups , trying stuff out and pushing to github, 
  in that case , i 'd say `` agda is similar to haskell and i 'm not going to apologise for looking stuff up on the internet until i 'm proficient in that , too . '', 
  employers have to meet you halfway here . 
  what 's your ideal 6 slot load out ? 
  i 've no idea . 
  all i know is that the only psychologist i know with a masters conducts interviews on inmates as a job . 
  sell veil , get refresher , no problem .
