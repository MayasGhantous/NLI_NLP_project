  actually getting into the market ? 
  shit , i should charge more . 
  in short , the same reasons that uk left euro zone mean we should also decline this . 
  it does look suspiciously like whites only commonwealth club ... 
  would you consider this post high-effort or low-effort ? 
  tfw australia rejects the uk because of immigrants flooding in from them . 
  they can talk to us after they do so , then . 
  if it has a long half life , it also is n't very radioactive . 
  the stuff that 's most dangerous is the stuff with half lives of 100 years or so ; not fast enough to burn up quickly , but too radioactive to be near . 
  even then , humans have made structures that last 500 years . 
  hell , half the pubs in london are that age . 
  besides axe ? 
  well , attack speed is capped at 0.18 seconds , so if anything , there 's more chance of attack speed being useless on low bat heroes than anything . 
   more chance, 
  not, 
   useless, 
  fair enough . 
  the point remains - you have * pubs * older than this country . 
  forms are addressed to, 
  the householder ,, 
  so , no , they do n't ( officially ) have your name . 
  there 's already a multimillion dollar industry shipping baby formula from new zealand to china because they ca n't trust their local suppliers . 
  it involves a chain of trust , usually college students sending packages in the mail directly to people who order from them via their equivalent of facebook and twitter . 
  i 'm considering ordering some milwaukee tools from the states ... 
  made in japan used to be a bad thing . 
  made in taiwan used to be a bad thing . 
  i guess it 's china 's turn to industrialise , along with mistakes and short cuts as you 'd expect . 
  `` jokes on you , i was only acting retarded '', 
  japanese stuff actually was terrible to start with , but we 're talking 1950s and 1960s . 
  that 's a fair assessment . 
  it 's hard to say that it 's a cultural thing when taiwan did n't go that route , but then again , perhaps the effects of the cultural revolution was the big difference in their way of working . 
  well that 's awkward . 
  step 1 : be chinese ( this is the most important step ), 
  step 2 : move overseas, 
  step 3 : [ earn $ 3000 per week ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/meet-the-chinese-students-making-up-to-3000-a-week-selling-australian-vitamins-and-baby-formula-back-to-china-2016-6 ), 
  do n't question mark, 
  case in point : pol pot . 
  fog computing . 
  this kills the advertising industry . 
  even if only the first time . 
  you can use acronyms after that . 
  sir action socks, 
  it 's implicit, 
  he 's out of the meta anyway . 
  nerfs to diffusal did n't help . 
  mcdonalds seems to do okay in australia , with its $ 17 minimum wage ( albeit adjusted downwards for young employees ), 
  til that hired limos are also taxis ( hint : they 're not ), 
   when will it stop ? 
  the qld government has already banned ibm from tendering for new contracts with them , after the queensland health fiasco . 
  that 's one opinion . 
  mine differs . 
  in both cases :, 
  * you use your phone and ask someone to drive you somewhere . 
  they drive you somewhere . 
  compare that with the alternate ways of using a taxi :, 
  * a vehicle with specific signage drives past . 
  you notice , hail them down , then get them to drive you somewhere . 
  * you walk to a rank of car park spots * specifically * for cars that drive you somewhere . 
  you go to the first vehicle in the rank , get in , and they drive you somewhere . 
  both of those methods will be denied to uber drivers in the proposed changes to the law . 
  i 'm not saying it 's worth a $ 500k license just for those alternate hailing methods , but that 's a different discussion . 
  is there a playlist of his segments ? 
  is that really a problem for senior executives , or is it just for the people who actually do things ? 
  a bit of both , perhaps . 
  either way , the government said `` i think we should see other people '' and broke up with them . 
  troll confirmed , guys . 
  before uber , i used to book town cars to the airport just because of fuckery like that . 
  it means he was legally entitled to pick you up , even before this law change . 
  so , like weatherman purge + siractionsocks combined ? 
  confirming this happened at the most recent multi-million dollar it project i worked on , too . 
  which suburb ? 
  it 's kinda relevant . 
   we need words . 
  if he gets blood on it from the pitchforks , it 'll come out in the wash . 
  because they want your money more , and are willing to sacrifice margin to get it . 
  nah , once you charge more than $ 1000 a day , you 're justified calling them consultants . 
  the crucial thing is oversight of the contract . 
   and the engineers , solution architects and project managers etc from the source company do n't pick up on it, 
  in my experience , it 's pretty rare for engineers , solutions architects etc from the source company to * even exist * . 
  more often , they 're hired from the tech partner . 
  clearly trench tier ; does n't tap for the best color in magic . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ have ^ ^ 5 ^ ^ of ^ ^ them ^ ^ :(, 
  at least we can up and downvote here , so the low-effort attempts get dumpstered . 
   the modelled peak load on census night was expected at 250 submissions per second and allowed for an average sustained peak of up to 350 submissions per second ( with a peak of 400 users per second ) to ensure that there was sufficient capacity . 
  i do n't even . 
  is your profession on this list ? 
  in what world is 1.44 m hits per hour going to be enough ? 
  considering that you need at least a half-dozen separate pages to complete a census form , that 's only ~ 250,000 people per hour . 
   seated massage, 
   * 10 minutes : $ 20:00, 
   * 15 minutes : $ 27.50, 
  in manila , that sum of money would go five times as far . 
  think of how many * other * retarded comments do n't reach top . 
  he got aghs before you got diffusal . 
  heck , he also got lens before you got diffusal . 
  the [ last time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/4uhet8/how_to_deal_with_sand_king_vs_pl/ ) this came up , the consensus was :, 
  * tank up, 
  * let sk initiate before you go in, 
  * disengage every ~ 8 seconds or so , before the next burrow strike hits, 
  * just do n't join the fight - splitpush elsewhere,
