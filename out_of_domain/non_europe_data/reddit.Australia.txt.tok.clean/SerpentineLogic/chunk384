  it 's a bit rich to denigrate nz for being 10 on the `` remote and inaccessible to refugees '' scale , when australia is 9.5, 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's horse-related things on the urban fringe , like at dayboro . 
  it used to be , back when the nbn was all about banning competition , otherwise the profitable suburbs would have duplicate cable and the unprofitable suburbs would get no coverage .

   using aws would have probably breached data privacy laws . 
  banks use aws , and they know your credit card details as well as your name , dob and address , so clearly there is a way .

  personally , i 'd rotate to the offlane to set up a gank there , then tell someone to rotate to safelane and `` help the jungler get a gank '' . 
  you 're right . 
  banks have tighter privacy regulation than the government has .

  why would there be , if the government pays the parental leave ? 
   so money that might have gone for raises or bonuses now will go for women who are n't working after childbirth . 
  employers do not pay out parental leave in most countries ; the government does , under various social security funds . 
  edit : full list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parental_leave#variation_in_international_law, 
  ah , so only * successful * women get paid parental leave . 
  i guess some are more equal than others . 
  africa : generally none , or < 1 week, 
  north and south america : ditto, 
  asia : lots with zero , many allow sharing some portion of maternity leave time between each parent , or a flat 1 week . 
  europe : if it has any , it 's usually 2 weeks or more . 
  can always merge hobbies with career . 
  for instance , i learned python by writing reddit bots , and friends learned node and angular to write apps for various game apis . 
  hell , perhaps / u/reflectionofself could submit patches to [ yasp ] ( https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp/ ) or something , to build some cred . 
  well , when you buyback , you respawn slower on your next death , so yeah , diebacks put you out of the fight ( and unable to farm ) for ages . 
  australia pays out 18 weeks @ minimum wage ( replacing various forms of ` baby bonus ' lump sum payments that previous conservative governments trialled ), 
  there have been calls to make it based on pre-leave income ( and thus , generally higher ) , but the pushback has been pretty big . 
  the rationale for it is that the state pays for parental leave , and does not believe that one baby is worth more money than another ( if * anything * , the state would give more money to poorer mothers ) so the current arrangement is left as-is , as a decent compromise . 
  australia has gender-neutral parental leave . 
  it still has ( much ) more parental leave for the primary caregiver vs secondary caregiver , but never specifies that the mother ** has to ** be primary . 
  do n't confuse correlation with causation . 
  it 's equally possible that countries that * already have * measures that foster more equal income would then turn their eyes to parental leave and make laws that match their philosophy . 
  * clearly * , we need paleo parental leave . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure the way they go to the toilet is the best in asia , aside perhaps singapore . 
  we also do n't have to go far from a city to find land good for solar .
