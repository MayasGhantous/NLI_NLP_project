   the knives come out, 
  complete with `` that 's not a knife ; * this * is a knife '' comments, 
  it 's also weird how a first world country like the states can have such * atrocious * roads once you get off a major highway . 
  one thing i miss about living in sydney was rocking up to a shopping centre at 10pm and buying groceries . 
   you guys have many immigrants coming in who are n't completely broke . 
  we have really high thresholds to stay in the country compared to the rest of the world . 
  perhaps that 's why asylum seekers is such a contentious issue - we 've been a a bit insulated from the stark realities of other countries in recent decades . 
  personally i think it 's a great idea , if a bit cold and selfish . 
  it 's a lot harder to get a ` family reunion ' style visa in australia compared to the us . 
  the problem is that when 20 % of immigrants are not * immediately productive members of the middle or upper class * , people wonder `` why do n't we just ban them from coming in ? '', 
  instead of realising that sometimes it 's just the right thing to do . 
  maybe kid did n't remember her phone number . 
  kids gon na be kids . 
  can you still do quests after the battle pass expires , even though points no longer work ? 
  or use your mirr -, 
  oh , i forgot . 
  taxi driver . 
  giving serco/transfield huge contracts does n't help . 
  footmen, 
  to the rich and the famous, 
  this is an update to [ this post three weeks ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/4vdz89/monash_university_academic_denied_permanent/ ) . 
  clearly, 
  that 's , like , how exercise works . 
  maybe swimming is better exercise ? 
  works your whole body . 
  right , but rebalancing does n't need to involve selling . 
  if product a is outperforming product b and you desire a 50/50 split , you can put $ 4000 into a and $ 6000 into b and it 's still rebalancing . 
  it 's okay vs np but only late , as a quelling upgrade . 
  it 's not something to rush . 
  either you snowball from pick off 's in which case you build single target damage , or you snowball from blade mail , in which case you build tank . 
  bf is only useful in niche cases , like vs np or megas . 
  ask him to do an ama ? 
  its a generation thing it was a really big thing before glasnost . 
  twil buyback consumes reliable gold * first * . 
  so in most cases , 33 % more damage . 
  normally you take 75 % magic damage due to resistances vs 100 % of pure damage . 
  support lich is really good at low tier play . 
  * you learn to stay the fuck away from people . 
  ( get casual wind lace anyway , because your positioning probably sucks ), 
  * you have a nuke that 's a slow , which is useful, 
  * your e pulls the creep wave back , which is necessary when your carry pushes the wave like a madman . 
  also , it 's a regular source of mana and xp , which is nice, 
  * your ult is great for teamfights , and allows you to run away afterwards . 
  also , the initial cast ministuns . 
  * late game , you have frost armour which even works on buildings , so you 're still useful . 
  just be careful about leaving it on autocast , since it will interrupt what you 're doing and you may miss important casts . 
  [ we care a lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1g9pftsckw ), 
  i have heard a lot of good things about bai rui . 
  from * within * the organisation ? 
  i guess this thin blue line talk was just propaganda then . 
  fucking over other cops . 
  op is really good at feeding . 
  mpfw, 
  this is the first time watching a game of lol . 
  i ca n't get over how bad it looks . 
  burn level : dresden, 
  tag line : `` love will [ set you free ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeit_macht_frei ) '', 
  you 'd do it for tidebringer , because the damage gets amplified . 
  probably not for normal last hits , but feel free to try if there 's nothing more pressing to worry about . 
  jenkins2 pipelines are a pain , and ugly , but powerful . 
  go.cd visualisation looks nice , but has serious flaws in the actual pipeline bit . 
  just remember the tax implications :, 
  bankwest has a normal kid 's saver account , and a special bonus saver account that offers 4.75 % interest , but has strict caps on how much you can put into it ( and after 12 months , ** all ** that money is shifted to the normal ksa ), 
  btw the normal ksa from bankwest appears to be pretty shit ( 1.75 % interest on amounts  10k , no bonus saver boost ), 
  compared to something like suncorp , which has a ksa with 3 % bonus rate and no apparently maximum per month . 
  oh , like [ noah webster did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noah_webster#dictionary ) ? 
  on the plus side , how * great * is it to beat britain at cricket ? 
  sometimes i wish necro and bristle could set their q to autocast ... 
  not sure if the thought pleases or disgusts me . 
  but it has starbuck . 
  they 're our little bru 's, 
  politicians changing their vocabulary to make a point ? 
  fair suck of the sauce bottle , comrade . 
  queensland : anus horribilis, 
  seemsgood thanks purge seemsgood, 
  in my experience , ta either take no damage from a hit , or she will die in the next hit ; there 's very little middle ground where blademail would help . 
  welcome to jamaica . 
  have a nice day . 
  in general , contracts pay 40 to 50 % more than permanent wages . 
  so if you are equivalent to a 90k per year permie , your cut of your daily rate should be closer to $ 575 per day . 
  as far as recruiter margins go , they should not start above 25/75 split ( but yours probably is ) so the recruiter should be able to pay that $ 75 per day and still retain a 10 % margin , which is about the point where recruiters get very unhappy with the situation . 
  as far as approaching your recruiter , do n't plead . 
  show data showing what you should be on , and state your case without begging . 
  see what you get in return . 
  if your recruiter is tight fisted , perhaps you need to reassess your relationship with them . 
  more importantly , always renegotiate after each contract . 
  even if you only get an extra $ 5 per day after a while , you are training your recruiter to shift their position instead of saying no . 
  i would have expected that from archerfield more than salisbury . 
  fully sick bro, 
  is this opposite day or something ? 
  this is a good compromise . 
  * more convenient that using a stopwatch app on your phone, 
  * not * more * powerful . 
  down to six-monthly now . 
  it 's a +2 racial bonus, 
  i 'd probably buy some of the ultra-cheap index funds the us has . 
  i think it 's more about how slow cooling makes long ice crystals form that puncture cell membranes . 
  thawing is a totally different set of challenges . 
  yes , but slightly more expensive .
