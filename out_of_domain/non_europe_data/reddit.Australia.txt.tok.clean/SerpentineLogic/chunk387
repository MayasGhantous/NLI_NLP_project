  it 's a mechanical battery . 
  think of it as a really big spring . 
  i 'd like to understand his arguments . 
  you really think this is pkk ? 
  my cynical nature suggests an opportunistic false flag op . 
  we do not comment on on-donation matters .

   javascript and java have very little in common except the name ) . 
  about as much in common as carpet and cars . 
  you can even ultimate out of duel . 
  you have binders full of holes . 
  actually , that checks out . 
  it 's definitely worth spending a few thousand euro , because it avoids, 
  * having to do onerous background checking ( just take a photo , get fingerprints and give them the cash , because you literally do n't care what their story is ), 
  * finding somewhere to put them and keep them fed while you check them out, 
  * people voluntarily withdrawing their application ** looks good politically **,

  pull the hard camp at 23 or 53 . 
  that will wipe out your entire wave , provided you do n't auto attack the camp at the same time . 
  then you can intercept the creep wave just outside your tower and kill them there . 
  wk crit is a lot better vs creeps than it used to be . 
  critting a large jungle creep for 1000 is kinda good . 
  you can also buy or hire a personal locator beacon , which allows emergency services to track you down by satellite triangulation when you activate it . 
  it works for hikers ; it 'll definitely work when you 're stuck halfway up a sand dune because you thought the gary highway was * actually * a highway instead of a dirt track . 
  know your audience . 
  labor is trying to get the message out to a populace that is n't really across the nbn issue . 
  `` stuffed up '' is something that 's vague , sure , but it gets the message across . 
  yeah , true , but he 's also not ck-level slow either . 
  he has an inbuilt sustain ability , and a crit . 
  that 's what i want from all politicians - i do n't need to agree with them , but i want them to have stances i at least * respect * . 
  that and those people who sell mobile-phone radiation blockers . 
  free tacos !, 
  end the injustice !, 
  in most australian states , you can stop once you run out of good candidates ; you do n't * have to * put a number against every candidate . 
  you * can * start with individual holdings whenever you want ; it 's likely that most people your parents ' age invested like that . 
  i went to a financial advisor back in the 90 's . 
  he recommended a mix of individual holdings and managed funds . 
  fast forward 10 years : the managed funds are all up ( varying degrees ) , and one of the individual stocks is great , 2 are about the same , one went terrible , and one got taken over by macquarie and their assets stripped . 
  diversified funds may not have the potentially-huge returns of individual stocks , but they also do n't have the risk of being totally worthless . 
  i 'm no 9th-dimension parcheesi grand-master , but he tells it like it is .

  a more accurate term would be machiavellian . 
  well played !, 
  ethanol is hygroscopic , which means it absorbs water . 
  if enough water is absorbed , it phase separates and drops to the bottom of your fuel tank . 
  this gets worse the longer you leave the fuel sitting in your tank . 
  that 's generally not a problem for modern fuel-injected engines , but if your car only has a carby , chances are its seals , hoses and o-rings will decay due to the ethanol/water mix due to not being modern . 
  fuel stabilisers will fix the hygroscopic issue but you ca n't do much about the deterioration of old engines without a costly rebuild . 
  even so , if you use e10 a lot , might be prudent to occasionally run the fuel tank low and refill with e0 from time to time . 
  i usually have enough time to check my team 's gpm and xpm to determine which roles are realistically available to me . 
  i wo n't support if everyone else on my team only has 320gpm because it 's clear they ca n't last hit . 
  ^ this ^ happens ^ a ^ lot, 
  on the other hand , if there 's a couple of guys on my team with 490gpm i feel a lot more confident and will happily go supp if needed . 
  i also look at the other team if there 's time , so i can see who spams various heroes , and if there 's a 700gpm smurf or something , which happens occasionally . 
  yes , it 's great . 
  there 's nothing you can do about that . 
  they 're in your game , just try to have fun and stay positive .

  when their mid t1 is down is a great time to wrap around behind other t1s , drop wards in the jungle and otherwise disrupt other lanes .

  aaaactually up to 10 % of your posts can advertise something , which is fine . 
   ** feel free to post links to your own content ** ( within reason ) . 
  but if that 's all you ever post , or it always seems to get voted down , take a good hard look in the mirror -- you just might be a spammer . 
  a widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio , i.e. 
  only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content .
