  * you 're * the one who gets intimate enough to notice his smell . 
  last election was pretty close ; i guess we 'll see in a couple of years . 
   under the constitution , the house of representatives lasts no more than three years after it first meets , but may be dissolved earlier . 
   after the house is dissolved or expires , writs for election must be issued within 10 days and the election must be held on a saturday between 33 and 58 days after the writs have been issued . 
  the most recent election was in june this year ( a double-dissolution election to attempt to break a senate blockade ) . 
  the incumbent conservative party attained a slim 76/150 seat majority in the lower house , but did not get a majority in the senate . 
  buzzfeed australia is like kotaku australia : not objectively good , but * so much * better than the american version . 
  what he 's trying to say is that you 're slicing your portfolio too thin . 
  imo if you have less than $ 2000 in a fund then you 're doing it wrong . 
  personally my minimum is $ 5k so that means two funds only . 
  this is a vaguely legit build . 
  allows you to use blood rage without being so vulnerable . 
  just do n't expect to mix it into a right click build . 
  it 's a clowny vod but there might be something to it . 
  you have a second chance though, 
  do not fear aging . 
  it depends how easily mmr flows between servers . 
  if one server is inflated , its mmr will be leached away by players from other servers . 
  so us west and east are similar . 
  australia is probably closer to sea levels . 
  this goes double for other drugs . 
  bored + money + opportunistic drug dealers = trouble, 
  i meant what i wrote . 
  less ecstasy more meth . 
  or possibly hawaii 0-5,

  just * digital * people ? 
  any time there are people with sudden wealth , there will be people to sell them things . 
  gold rush times ? 
  saloon bars , whores and opium dens . 
  oil rigs and mine sites ? 
  bottle shops , brothels and drug dealers ( although the girls are usually fifo as well - when the m : f ratio is something like 13:1 , you 'd get worn out too ), 
  two joe hockey middies, 
   as far as garret went as a politician , he did n't get much respect . 
  true . 
   the labour party put him in a safe seat ( practically un-losable electorate ) . 
  and for all his activism for environmental protection and aboriginal rights he was pretty quiet about those things once he got into government . 
  also true . 
  i believe he ended up sharing the environment portfolio with penny wong , so he was considerably more of a mascot than a power broker . 
   especially when the government he served extended the controversially paternalistic ( and arguably racist ) northern territory intervention policy under the banner of ` stronger futures ' . 
  more details [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stronger_futures_policy ) . 
  note that this was not in his portfolio so he likely had no input on it . 
  politics vov, 
   he was also responsible for a rushed economic stimulus program during the gfc that was n't effectively regulated and ended up with a few people dying from poor work health and safety conditions . 
  the opposition party had a fair go at him for that . 
  so he 's pretty widely considered a disappointment as a politician . 
  i take issue with the stimulus program . 
  it was rushed , but it needed to be , and it was a good mix of immediate stimulus , and job-creating work that saved the country ( and citizens ) money in the long run . 
  yes , people died , but when your boss cuts corners with safety , that boss is going to get someone killed sooner or later . 
  the blame lies more with the bosses than the government . 
  was it perfect ? 
  would it have been better with more resources allocated to safety inspectors ? 
  yes . 
  was it , in the end , probably too much ? 
  [ probably ] ( http://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1157038/shuyun_may_li_-_adam_spencer.pdf ) . 
  was it still a worthwhile endeavour , given that overshooting was less risky than undershooting ? 
  i say yes . 
  more likely , one side decides to invade , and the other side hastily does the same , much like russia and the allies taking land in germany after ww2 . 
  on the plus side , that 's when the sun is out , so solar power can offset the power draw .

  counteroffers can not buy loyalty ; they only buy time . 
  yes , but then you have an octarine core instead of a more useful item . 
  pulling into the small camp only clears the wave if you have previously stacked it . 
  otherwise , there will be creeps left over , which will push the lane when they return to it . 
  i wonder whether the store ( or salesman ) got some kind of kickback from the online store from that . 
  i know that many companies have a separate fund for price-match discounts so an individual store does n't get smashed if a cheap competitor sets up next door . 
  perhaps gg have the same thing going between in-store and online . 
  this is incorrect . 
   damage block also occurs [ before any armor reductions ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/damage_block ) . 
  however , this works in your favour if you have illusions , since the damage is blocked before they take +300 % damage or whatever . 
  the wall to end all walls, 
  that hollow feeling in your gut when you realise that you have zero chance of swimming back to land against this current . 
  if you find yourself in this situation , the worst thing you can do is keep trying to swim ashore , but most people are almost exhausted before they realise this , and drown . 
  well , sometimes you just want a break from dodging jellyfish and sharks . 
  well there 's always the children in det \\* mmmmmph \\*, 
  how many artifacts do you have in your 60 ? 
  without stars and spheres , you have much less chance - it 's probably better in ux than straight u. 
  uw has better options for creature removal and stalling than this ( although if you go all-in on thopters i guess this helps you get the combo ) . 
   the more people you step on , the more backbiting you expose yourself to, 
  that 's what middle management is for : to [ insulate ] ( http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/ ) the workers with a layer of people who buy into the idea of the company .

  you clearly adhere to the us congress school of job creation .

  actually , yeah , because there 's always greens and labor supporters bitching about their own party 's policies .

  well , that 's a compelling value proposition right there . 
  this will happen regardless , because people are people .
