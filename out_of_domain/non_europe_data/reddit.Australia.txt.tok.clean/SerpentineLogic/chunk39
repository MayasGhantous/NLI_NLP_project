  you know , like perfume and stuff . 
  eve-central has an api . 
  ... or not , as it turned out . 
  do n't forget the flat 10 % sales tax ( except for fresh food and home rental ), 
  on the other hand , at least it 's only 10 % . 
  do n't tell the censorship board how easy it is to get stuff from the internet ... 
  cost of living is about the same as london or new york in most major oz cities , give or take 10 % . 
  i live here . 
  the links are legit . 
  australia truly is a non-retarded place to live . 
  the dangers are overstated . 
  i have n't been chased by one of those fuckers for two decades . 
  this makes it even more impressive . 
  actually , it 's because australian banks are regulated sufficiently that they could n't pull the same tricks as the us banks . 
  even with no resource boom we 'd be in ( relatively ) decent economic shape . 
  we 'd be hit , sure , but not to the extent of the us or uk . 
  to be fair , australians often train with us equipment so when they drag us into wars , we do n't have to ship our own tanks and planes to the sandbox to help out . 
  some of the healthcare savings are due to a [ single-buyer program ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pharmaceutical_benefits_scheme ) for pharmaceuticals . 
  it 's like how walmart works against its suppliers , but with an entire country backing it up . 
  for the lower class , perhaps . 
  there 's no gst on basic food . 
  it was a condition of the democrats to pass the original bill . 
  graduate , then come over here for a few years . 
  quick way to earn six figures a year . 
  australia 's unemployment benefit system is n't the best . 
  it 's better to give more money per week , for less time , than to be miserly with the stipend but let people stay on it for longer . 
  at least certain politicians are [ serious about it ] ( http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2012/04/senator-live-dole-week ) . 
  what 's outback steakhouse ? 
  most high sec players stop at p1 or p2 . 
  if you have access to a low tax lowsec customs office , making p3 or p4 is more reasonable , even if you have to buy extra input materials .

  the rupture can be nano fit to have the same speed profile as a stabber but with a better slot and hull bonus , just because it has extra slots to play with . 
  no , we were just on a t1 cruiser roam and got lucky . 
  thanks . 
  probably a titan . 
  for one thing , they know how much is in your wallet . 
  that story would be more epic if you were the one delivering cheap ass . 
  * everyone * dies . 
  but what about the cheap ass ? 
  yeah , careful bro . 
  you wo n't like epising when he 's angry . 
  if you want , you can actually do the career agent arc more than once , since there are [ three rookie systems ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/rookie_systems ) for each race . 
  i think it would work , but you might have to choose resin and/or order it in a larger size . 
  the pod exported from eve is not hollow . 
  you 'd save a bunch if you added a hole though . 
  i imagine if you were christopher reeve , you 'd have liked to do anything at all with your arms . 
  yes , your gf will enjoy the market . 
  in fact , do not be surprised when she makes so much isk that she bankrolls you . 
  heck , depending on your accountant , you could probably write off the subscription fee at tax time under study expenses ( except you 'll soon be using all that in-game currency to pay for your subscription anyway ) . 
  also this :,

  if she gets bored easily , she probably wo n't do well in her economics degree ... 
  i 'll probably buy my mum [ a duck ] ( http://www.oxfamunwrapped.com.au/gift-150-duck ) . 
  they ca n't drop jet cans , but they can launch anchorable stuff . 
  how else do you think i hubs get there ? 
  drakes are fairly good actually , especially when your skills allow you to take off tanking modules from the low slots and fit more damage modules . 
  caldari are a bit narrow in pvp at the moment , but the drake is a mainstay of combat fleets , and can take on pretty-much any pve site , save for some of the riskier deadspace complexes and incursion sites . 
  other caldari ships that see heavy use are the falcon and scorpion for ecm , and the tengu for being like a drake , except generally better ( also ten times the price ), 
  there 's also a niche use for rokhs and nagas for sniping , so if you want to use turrets it 's not the total write-off that it was a year ago . 
  you can easily cross-train for a talos , which is very popular in small gang roams . 
  if you were planning to cross-train , i suggest you stick to one race at a time . 
  probably the easiest would be gallente since you can use the t2 guns with your caldari ships as well , and gallente ships can shield tank in a pinch . 
  after that , minmatar would be the next choice , since they shield tank and sometimes have missiles . 
  that 's where a lot of asians get their calcium from , since they do n't generally have a lot of dairy in their diet . 
  there 's a popular dish given to pregnant chinese women that consists of pigs trotters stewed in rice vinegar with spices . 
  the acid in the vinegar leaches out a lot of the calcium from the foot bones , making it especially helpful in preventing pregnancy-related bone density loss . 
  first , tell me about what attribute spread you have . 
  obviously , if you are planning to do a neural remap or something , that will affect what skills you train before vs after . 
  having said that , concentrate on getting battlecruiser skills up first , since they are a stepping stone for battleships . 
  a few things :, 
  * take off tactical shield manipulation for now . 
  you wo n't need shield skills as amarr until you know what you 're doing . 
  * prioritise anything that increases your capacitor , especially if you 're going to remap away from the skill soon . 
  * tech 2 pulse lasers really are that good . 
  * you probably do n't need energy grid upgrades v at your skill level . 
  * unless you are dead-set on covert ops or hacking , you do n't need electronics upgrades v, 
  where do i begin ? 
  since you logged out ages ago , you might be able to get your stuff moved out of nullsec . 
  however , bear in mind that , while some gms will move all your stuff , the guidelines only state that you will get the ship you 're currently piloting moved , so make sure you 're in your most expensive ship when you petition , 
  there has been moderate isk inflation , but your ships should have held out fairly well against the rising prices . 
  faction pos towers and modules were removed from the loot tables a while back , so prices are very high, 
  most npc sell orders also got removed , so if you have stocks of robotics or whatever , they might be worth something . 
  ok , so the expansions since trinity :, 
  ** empyrean age **, 
  * factional warfare , gallente/minmatar vs amarr/caldari , you can shoot any of the opposing factions , like a massive wardec . 
  you get shot by opposing factions in their highsec though by npcs . 
  0.5 rats can be tanked easily by a solo drake whereas the 1.0 spawns rape you and web/neut/damp . 
  pretty much abandoned by ccp until the last couple of months . 
  good for getting small scale pvp fights in lolsec , you can also run lowsec fw missions which give good isk/hr . 
  it 's possible to capture systems by running fw plexes in them but does n't do anything outside of lolrp except changing a bit of text in system info . 
  * new faction ships which all suck except for the omen , including navy osprey , navy exequror , scythe-fleet issue , and omen navy issue . 
  * a new lolsec region called ` black rise ' got added , which links to cr and is next to essence and the citadel lowsec . 
  * orca , highsec capable rorqual which gets similar bonuses and can store ships inside it . 
  default ship for highsec miner support now . 
  * scrams now shut down mwds , making a lot of ships with limited midslots a lot better . 
  afterburners are now useful and used to dictate range within scram range . 
  scrams are the new webs, 
  * webs got nerfed from 90 % t2 to 60 % t2 . 
  * all ships got slowed down , poly carbons and nanos nerfed to give speed/agility ( stacks with istabs/ods ) , ods nerfed heavily , aux thrusters nerfed .
