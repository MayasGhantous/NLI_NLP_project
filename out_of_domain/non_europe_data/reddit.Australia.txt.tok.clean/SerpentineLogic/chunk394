   if you go into an interview as a counsellor you will undoubltedly by asked to show your certification , but also asked interview questions about your professionalism and personality . 
  if you can nail that , as long as you have a cert whatever from anywhere it wo n't matter . 
  that 's fine , unless your course was shit , like op 's is , and you do n't actually learn enough from it . 
  just bear in mind that vas ( and related ones like vhy ) is relatively heavy on banks , so you probably do n't need to supplement it with direct investment in that sector . 
  in fact , probably the opposite . 
  is it possible to redraw from the home loan to pay off other loans that have a higher interest rate ? 
  a president who thinks ahead . 
  i 'm gon na miss that . 
  i was under the impression pl illusions had a tiny collision radius - small enough to get past each other easily , but large enough that they wo n't stack when they all attack the same target . 
  $ 6500/year for private health cover sounds expensive . 
  obviously that 's top cover for a family , but it might be possible to drop from top level extras down to medium cover for extras - that could save $ 2000/year . 
  ok , well if you 're going to pause ivf for a year or two , you can at least save money during that time . 
  set a calendar event to remind you to increase the cover again when it 's time . 
  i do n't know about him , but it 's important to know what level everyone is . 
  it let 's you know how much xp the offlane is getting and thus how the lanes are going even in the absence of kills , when supports get their ultimate etc. 
  doom cries a bit more . 
  he could have lived a thousand years .

  * [ stockspot fat cats ] ( https://www.stockspot.com.au/fatcat/ ) report of the highest fee/worst performing funds, 
  * [ spiva active vs passive fund ] ( http://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-australia-mid-year-2016.pdf ) report, 
  no surprises , but it 's possible to quantify just how bad most actively-managed funds perform . 
  `` hi , i 'd like to complain about my internet service . 
  it 's total shit '', 
  `` sir , did you * read * your contract ? '', 
  i 'm * pretty sure * it 's satire , mate . 
  economists have predicted eighteen of the last two crashes . 
  probably the best idea . 
  it 's not really a pyramid scheme , but it 's a lot closer to a paper delivery route than it appears . 
  bladefury deals 80 / 105 / 130 / 155 dps ( x5 seconds ) , minus magic resistance . 
  at level 5 with aquila , 1 point in crit and more importantly phase boots , you deal 126 dps , minus armour and damage block, 
  * 70.04 dps from stats, 
  * 10.30 dps from the + damage of aquila, 
  * 24.72 dps from phase boots, 
  * 21.01 dps from crit, 
  however , blade fury works a lot better when chasing . 
  that 's incorrect - that 's only needed for 1 autoattack per jump . 
  if you have slower attack time , you wo n't attack the first jump but will get hits on later jumps . 
  especially the south korean coastguard hulls . 
  you know he 's gone overboard when he charges 17 % . 
  not sure if / s, 
  i especially like how they pronounced aussie to rhyme with bossy . 
  it 's those little touches of authenticity that make a difference . 
  this really grabbed my, 
  attention, 
  no nuggets of wisdom ? 
   admittedly , the capital firm stripped tegel of all its real estate assets first - basically sold anything not bolted down . 
  ingham now rents its own factories , so yeah . 
  apparently they 're coming back after christmas this year . 
  are you sure ? 
  hillary would be definitely centre-right compared to australian politics . 
  then again , the australian version of the democrats have also shifted right compared to their roots . 
  * she 's super hawkish compared to australian mainstream, 
  * australians do not buy into `` what 's good for the stock market is good for the country '', 
  leaving aside issues with her personality and behaviour ( because politicians are terrible the world over ) , it 's probably more that she approaches policies based on where the us is today , which is way more right of field than contemporary australian laws . 
  i.e she has policies that push the us left , but the same outcome would be a shift to the right if enacted in australia , due to where we already are on that continuum - e.g. 
  minimum wage , gun control , taxes , healthcare etc. 
  on the other hand , she 's way more left-wing on immigration - australia has lurched far to the right since 1991 on that subject . 
  also , it 's a * lot * harder to win when your 6k tilts , compared to when one of your 4k teammates does . 
   hillary is totally anti guns . 
  like i said : she might be left of the us mainstream on guns , but not australia . 
  i have seen 0 pistols , 1 shotgun and 2 rifles in my entire life , and only because i know people who operated cattle properties . 
  the majority of australians have never seen a gun , and have zero chance of even * owning * one . 
  the fact that australian cops need to write reports to justify even * drawing * their pistols illustrates the difference between the countries on this issue . 
  the current government is actively hostile to lgbt issues ( they passed laws banning gay marriage the last time they were in power ), 
  the government , and all parties to the right of them , are actively hostile towards immigrants and muslims , and have many party members who are more overtly racist than that . 
  yeah , but it 's very much a case of ` perceived ' immigration rather than ` experienced ' . 
  * australia is an island , so you ca n't just sneak over a fence, 
  * we have a navy , so we catch boats and send them back , or place them in detainment camps, 
  * we 're really , * really * slow to process people out of detainment camps ( which i personally am not okay with ), 
  * we consistently never reach our yearly intake cap of refugees anyway , which is where the angst is directed towards ( we have very strict requirements for non-refugee immigrants , which i personally think is a great idea , but it 's hard to get in via family ties ), 
  australia has weathered numerous influxes of immigrants and refugees :, 
  * post-ww2 southern europeans, 
  the current wave of fear is an overreaction that has been fuelled by politicians instead of diffused like the previous ones . 
  frankly , it did n't have to be this way . 
  the benefit of compulsory voting - you get punished for going full ideologue . 
  the aussie stock market is dominated by banks and mining companies , which do n't really have good reputations - there 's no darlings like google and apple to improve the collective pr image of the market . 
  note , however , that australia has a history of attacking anti-competitive and cartel practices , e.g. 
  [ four pillars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_pillars_policy ) and [ the accc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_competition_and_consumer_commission ) . 
  it 's free market , but ** not ** laissez-faire . 
  our labor party is also dominated by the right faction , which is third way . 
  increasingly , left-leaning labor voters are turning to the greens, 
  a song is just a poem with a catchy tune . 
  that 's the problem with the gop . 
  they always try to walk it in . 
  they do n't steal because they need to . 
  they steal because they want to , and do n't think they 'll be punished if they get caught . 
  which is probably pretty accurate tbh . 
  * drums : 1785, 
  it 's not much cheaper than armlet , and provides a fraction of the combat capability . 
  i ca n't say i recommend it . 
  if you want an early game item that 's worth it , perhaps medallion + blight stone might be a better option . 
  just google for australian coffee shops in the us ; there 's bound to be some on each coast . 
   how many last hits will you honestly get in a totally uncontested safe lane at 10 minutes is it 50 ? 
  fyi it 's entirely possible that the ** best ** player in a < 1k match has fewer than 40 lh at 10min . 
  it happened three times in my last eight ranked games . 
  are there prison psychs in your country ? 
  they have a high turnover , but it helps to get a start in the industry . 
  i get 20ms to sydney , that 's where the game servers are . 
  ping to the us is a red herring . 
  i draw the line at posting rare pepe memes,
