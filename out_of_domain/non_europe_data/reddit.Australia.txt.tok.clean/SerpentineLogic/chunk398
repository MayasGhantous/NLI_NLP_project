  the pound is still hit by brexit . 
  if the aud drops , buying gbp will be more expensive , but it 's historically cheap at the moment . 
  will it go up or down ? 
  no idea . 
  but if you look at the [ 10 year chart ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=aud&amp;to=gbp&amp;view=10y ) you can see that buying gbp now is pretty good , considering . 
   i 'm all for dark jokes , like really dark, 
  `` how dark ? 
  dark enough to commit suicide in custody '', 
  why would airfare prices drop when the aud drops ? 
  once you subscribe to the guides , they are available for you to use .

  vancouver [ added a 15 % surcharge ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/vancouver-real-estate-foreign-house-buyers-tax ) for foreigners buying properties there . 
  foreign purchases dropped off a cliff afterwards . 
  it might not have popped their housing bubble but it deflated it a big chunk . 
  to be honest , from the title i thought it was going to be a bus driver costume . 
   money collected from the tax will be put towards housing initiatives for renters , low-income residents and first-time buyers , amid record numbers of homeless in the city .

  twil that last week 's trick about using shadow amulet while charging does n't work . 
  the preferred term in australia is to refer to people as indigenous australians . 
  ` aboriginal ' is fine as an adjective , but its use as a noun is being phased out . 
  mom is primarily picked up as a farm accelerator , just as maelstrom is . 
  mom used to be picked up by carries like jugg , since the active used to provide a big speed boost as well as the attack speed amp . 
  since that time , mom has been nerfed . 
  these days , mom is picked up on carries as a mid-game item to get some ganks and sustain their health , with the eventual goal of replacing it when 5-slotted . 
  this usually means mom is picked up on heroes like drow , sniper and medusa , but occasionally on other ( tanky ) heroes that have on-hit procs . 
  this is why regeneration runes are so good on storm . 
  also , remember you can use tp scrolls when using your ult , so if you need to clear waves to push a lane back from your t3 , you can get almost halfway across the map before being teleported back to your fountain . 
  life steal is critical , armlet is very very good . 
  after that , you need ways to survive on low health , so halberd is surprisingly okay . 
  but basically life steal plus armlet . 
  read up about personal services income . 
  and get income protection insurance . 
  trust me on this , you do not want to be self employed when accident strikes . 
  it 's tax deductible , so there 's that . 
  same at the wesley . 
  especially for a first-time mum , it 's a lot of pressure , both covert and overt . 
  when i finally snapped and fed the baby some formula , it was a massive stress relief for all three of us . 
  we still kept trying to breastfeed , but without the starvation-level crying . 
  there 's a reason chinese people are sending cartons of baby formula back home - it 's because they trust our stuff . 
  no , they really fucking do n't . 
  nobody trusts any milk products from china . 
  hell , even the white rabbit chinese lollies arent made from chinese milk after 2008 . 
  you have parents or family back in the uk , right ? 
  if you 're still tight with them , maybe they can open a bank account for you to transfer money into ? 
  also , 3 % pa compounded takes a decade to reach 1.3 times the starting amount , so if you transfer money into a gbp account earning 0 % , you have many years for the exchange rate to recover . 
  probably the easiest way to invest would be to buy into a ftse index fund . 
  you get that 30 % boost right now , and it 's an actual investment rather than just currency exchange rate arbitrage . 
  veq : `` ftse developed europe '' @ 0.35 % mer might be an alternative to veu if estate taxes are an issue . 
  plus it 's narrower in scope , which might appeal . 
  takes all the fun out of life . 
  it takes a lot longer than one day to grow mj . 
  ^ ( ^ the ^ implication ^ is ^ that ^ the ^ plants ^ were ^ already-grown , ^ and ^ thus ^ were ^ illegal ^ when ^ planted ), 
  it could easily keep going down ( although there 's obviously a point where people realise that the uk is not zimbabwe and it stabilises ) . 
  having said that , the pound is 30 % cheaper than it was , so even if it drops further , locking in that 30 % savings is pretty nice . 
  yeah , but vts is n't as much of a problem as veu . 
  some income from veu is lost because of the tax situation between e.g. 
  eurozone income being foreign to veu.us and veu.ax , whereas the tax situation is easier for vts ( domestic for vts.us , foreign for vts.ax but you get an earned income tax credit because of tax treaties ), 
  eh , it 's still up in the air a bit .

  cassowary enclosures at zoos have metal plates around them .

  roo tail stew is definitely a thing . 
  probably because the last time i ate a roo that we 'd killed ourselves , the tail and hind legs were the only parts we dared to eat .

  scrimping for savings is less efficient than spending money on improving your earning potential .
