  i 've heard rumours that sisi playtesting showed the bonus to be overpowered . 
   i also have n't heard a single thing mentioned about ew drones . 
  the latest sisi patch includes some nerfs to the valkyrie sw-600 and warrior sw-300 ewar drones . 
  of course , they are n't actually available on tq . 
  they 're looking at what they can do with bomb launchers at the moment . 
   ... tech 2 bomb launcher : indeed , is also a bit weak on its own , we are considering some options mentioned in this thread . 
   tech 2 probe launchers/drone modules : may very well make some faction variants obsolete indeed , it needs to be looked at further . 
  i especially liked the [ aurum token ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=2833&amp;build=sisi ) . 
  some people say this has already happened . 
  [ question answered ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/hijrg/want_to_move_to_australia_great/ ), 
  it does grate , somewhat , yes . 
  also , americans take decades to lose their accent , which irritates us further . 
  * work out the tech 1 blueprint of the t2 ship or module you want, 
  * find it on chruker ( or view [ this list ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/crucible-item-spoiler/ ) and navigate to the t1 blueprint ), 
  * go to the bottom right corner of the page , and click ` change to sisi ', 
  * now you can view the invention requirements directly , e.g. 
  [ mapc ii ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=11564&amp;build=sisi ), 
  * you can click through to the t2 blueprint link to see what the bill of materials are, 
  problem . 
  solved . 
   that is some terrible logic right there . 
  no it 's not . 
  fact is , game development pays terribly and if you do n't want to put up with the bad pay , long hours and tight deadlines , your employer will happily kick you to the curb because there 's thousands of young programmers with stars in their eyes , aching for a chance to work at the same company that filled their childhood with such memorable gaming experiences . 
  they 're not in it for the money ; they 're in it for the prestige and for the fun ( just like guys in the pr0n industry ) . 
  liang 's point is that , by and large , the bulk of ccp 's employees are doing it because they * want * to make great games . 
  now that ccp management is finally * letting them * , they should be encouraged to continue . 
  surely he can be paid in isk tho ? 
  liang was * very * prolific on the eve-o boards , answering pretty-much every thread in ships and modules iirc . 
  he was banned after protesting against the banning of helicity boson ( hulkageddon organiser ), 
  i think that was helicity . 
   also liang was pretty good at predicting the economy if i 'm thinking of the right person . 
  are you sure you are n't talking about akita t ? 
  that 's the way ccp omen is leaning , according to the test server feedback forum . 
  because many of us already knew about it ? 
  people buy forum signatures with isk . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  then , think of it as someone paying it forward and providing a discount to everyone else who orders a model through you . 
  wolf creek : fiction , or * documentary * ? 
  still a week away from logi v and still getting lots of incursion invites in my basilisk . 
  ( flying a scimitar with logi iv is a bit painful tho ), 
  so , you were n't blocking anything important , and people could just go around you guys ? 
  well , hell that 's just * asking * for pepper spray to the face . 
  nice try , chopper read . 
  i recall one of the recent builds was called nero . 
  how appropriate that it was released when rome was burning . 
  seleene mentioned that with the massive numbers of developers currently working on eve , they could pull off * three * apocrypha-level expansions * per year * . 
  assuming you have production efficiency v ( without which you will not be competitive ) , some tech 1 items may be slightly profitable ( like , 25k isk per hour , according to [ this site ] ( http://www.eve-market-guide.com/manufacturing.php ) ) , assuming you have a researched blueprint , that is . 
  generally , though , you 're better off selling the minerals on market until you find an opportunity . 
  i approve of your entrepreneurial spirit . 
  sounds like a normal kid . 
  children being childish ; how unusual . 
  in lowsec/null/w-space :, 
  * put down extractors, 
  * process to p1, 
  * optionally : process four different p1s into a single p3, 
  * ship out for sale, 
  in highsec :, 
  * buy cheap off market, 
  * [ process for sale ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ), 
  i think you overestimate the skill of idiots in stealth bombers . 
   this also encourages quick lock anti bomber thrashers in fleets . 
  fyp . 
  sig radius buff on destroyers is also to harden them vs bombs . 
  inventing and building t2 bubbles takes ages too , but people still do it . 
  i think there was a drone haven/sanctum equivalent that you could pop a structure and all the waves would spawn at once instead of needing to wait between waves . 
  there are meta-2 capital high slots though . 
  jump freighters are tech 2 freighters . 
  that means, 
  * invention takes up 40 days to make a bpc and run the invention job , vs easy-mode freigher bpos, 
  * manufacturing requires a freighter , which is about as much effort to build a carrier by itself, 
  * and * then * you need to make a bunch of t2 capital components out of technetium etc. 
  and by many , i mean  5500 extra t2 capital components . 
  relevant back-of-the-envelope [ calculation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/myjbq.png ) . 
  thus far , yes . 
  nullsec is about 3 mill per planet . 
  litres per 100km is standard in australia . 
  it makes perfect sense , too . 
  `` oh , you use 6l per hundred ks ? 
  that 's , lem me see , * twice * as efficient as my car that does 12 . '', 
  what could possibly go ( politically ) wrong ? 
  conduct unbecoming, 
  no pun intended, 
  hopefully * exactly the same amount * ~, 
  so , go silent partner and go sabbatical ~, 
  once you have an exit strategy in mind , you 'll be surprised how much easier it is to put up with your daily grind . 
  yes . 
  also , thanks for continuing to host eve-central even though you have n't played in years . 
  let 's look at tha damage graph vs a battleship @ 200m/s, 
  * blue - tornado, 
  * red - oracle, 
  * green - talos, 
  * yellow - naga, 
  * ( purple - muninn ), 
  it 's a respectable damage profile for the naga , which indicates that ships with a 5 % damage bonus to rails are vaguely as effective as a 1400mm boat ( sans alpha ), 
  they 're not pwnmobiles , but they 're not terrible either . 
  neutrons are a lot better range than other blaster tiers , and now you can fit them . 
  about 50 % according to ccp omen, 
  first corp bookmarks , now this . 
  two step delivers . 
  taxation,
