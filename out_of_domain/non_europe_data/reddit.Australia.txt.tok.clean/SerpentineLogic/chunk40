  lots of implants moved to slot 6 making most of them useless . 
  skirmish warfare skill now gives agility instead of speed . 
  x-stinct boosters now give - sig instead of speed . 
  * stackless ui and 64bit shit made jita actually stable with 1000 guys in it . 
  * certificates/medals - some cool looking but useless things that you 'll forget exist after a few days , most people just send medals to corp members saying `` useless fuck '' . 
  ** apocrypha **, 
  * probing system revamped , it 's now not shit , and based more on player skill than the ship skill . 
  probing skills are still important , but you 're not going to have to : lolwaitfor7minutesperscan : . 
  it 's now 100 % accurate , as long as you have significant probe strength , as opposed to the previous chance based system, 
  * wormholes , wormholes go into wormhole space , they can be probed down , and you run sites in their to get components to build t3 ships . 
  the npcs inside have much better ai and in wormholes of class 3 and higher you generally need an organised group to run them . 
  if you lose your probes/probing ship then you 're stuck and have to commit seppuku to escape . 
  * tech 3 cruisers , basically better , more expensive hacs . 
  have 5 subsystems with 4 options which can be swapped out and changes the look of the ship as well . 
  theres only about 2 useful configurations per ship though . 
  have some interesting options like a covert cloak system and interdiction nullifier subsystem which allows you to warp in bubbles and prevents them from dragging you, 
  * rigs are now sized based . 
  frigate rigs cost 1/25th of a bs rig so you now basically fit a rig on everything including rifters . 
  * epic mission arcs - you can now choose dialog box 1 , 2 or 3 to choose what mission you would like to next during the arc . 
  good rewards at the end of it . 
  * stealth bombers are now awesome , can use covert cloaks now and they use torpedos and do about 450-500 dps each . 
  still are made of paper and get raped by a 1 week old noob in a merlin since they have no anti-frig support . 
  but are now very nice in recon gangs as dps ships . 
  bombs cost much less now also , and can generally be bought for 800k each or so . 
  most alliances like to do bombing runs on large blobs of enemy ships , making them fairly useful . 
  * ecm got range nerfed , and falcon/rook lost ecm optimal bonuses . 
  falcon got 10m3 and rook got 25m3 drones to compensate . 
  rook is actually a decent ship now for solo faggotry . 
  * you can now remap your attributes every year . 
  remapping allows you to focus your attributes wherever you want , so you can now all be achuras without being ugly . 
  ** dominion **, 
  * all the pirate faction ships were given unique bonuses and rebalanced and all with a few exceptions are really good pvp ships . 
  angel cartel ships are now fotm . 
  the frigate navy ships were also redesigned and are now also awesome . 
  * autocannons got buffed by increased dps , increased falloff on higher tier acs , doubled ammo capacity and tracking enhancers and tracking computers now effect falloff . 
  artys are now awesome . 
  hybrids are still shit . 
  * the sov system got changed and is no-longer based on pos . 
  they are now based on shooting structures for hours . 
  * systems are upgradeable ( although the anomaly upgrades recently got nerfed hard ) so you can turn some shitty regions into decent ones , the upgrades include increased anomalys , higher chance of plexes spawning , higher chance of wormholes spawning , guranteed hidden asteroid belts , and mini-profession sites ( such as hacking ) . 
  * there are now pirate faction epic arcs ( guristas and angels ) that can be run by afs/intys and you get decent rewards for doing it , standings + faction cruiser bpc . 
  * fleet finder , you can now just ` search for fleets ' and join a fleet if its listed in the fleet finder . 
  useful for joining ctas etc without having to ask for x 's . 
  * supercarriers now are awesome and considered op . 
  the hel is still shit though . 
  * titans also got massive hitpoint buff and their doomsday has been changed to single target although it does 3 million damage at dd5/titan5 , so now insta 's carriers . 
  n1 ccp way to rape dreads, 
  * planetary interaction , all npc seeded goods have been removed and are now manufactured by players . 
  you can put a command centre on a planet , extract goods and process them into different materials using processors on planets . 
  * eve-gate , aka spacebook most people have forgotten about this the week after it came out , or use it for writing evemails from their browser ( but not their mobile phones because loljavascript ), 
  : thats literally it for tyrannis :, 
  * eve player rage growing *, 
  * you are now able to walk around in your captain quarters , which replace the ship hangar . 
  it 's considered mostly useless and too needy on computer hardware , making having more than one client open difficult . 
  luckily , you can disable it in the graphical options and stare at a picture of a door instead . 
  ccp now has plans to bring back the ship hangar later . 
  * a virtual store was introduced , called noble exchange ( nex ) . 
  you can buy stupidly expensive items for your character with aurum , a new currency ( 1 plex = 3500 aurum ) . 
  items bought in the nex can be sold for isk . 
  this feature is also considered mostly useless . 
  * agent finder : a new service that let you search agents by level , division , faction , location etc. . . 
  * there is also a corp finder with criteria such as pvp , pve , factionnal warfare , casual , 0.0 etc. . . 
  * turrets overhaul : all turrets models got upgraded , but there is still no logic in their design whatsoever . 
  * maller hull overhaul . 
  * scanning mechanics were changed . 
  all 8 probes now contribute to the result . 
  it is now possible to scan setups that were previously `` unproblable '' , granted you have nearly perfect skills and implants . 
  * only one jump bridge can be online in a solar system . 
  storage was increased from 10k to 30k . 
  * eve player rage over 9000 , rioting occurs , people unsub , csm is flown to iceland , ccp starts firing people , fragile peace accord is signed *, 
  ( continued ), 
  ** incursion **, 
  * there are now incursions that happen in all of eve k-space . 
  incursions are mostly group pve content , they use sleeper ai and each sansha npc has a role like logistics , scrambling , bomber npcs etc. 
  you get concord lp for completing them which can be used to by meta 2 capital modules ( this includes remote shield , energy , armor and guns/launchers only ) and new .5 implants . 
  incursions will shit up the system with penalties that reduce bountys , cyno jam the system , prevent jump bridges being used from the system , and will reduce your resistances . 
  the rats at belts and gates will also be changed to super elite rats which will rape the average player ship making mining and belt ratting almost impossible . 
  theres also a sanshas mothership and sansha fighter bombers but it 's considered to be terrible because of lol shields . 
  * new character creator, 
  * learning skills removed , and any sp you had invested them in is now refunded and can be applied to any skills that you want from the character sheet . 
  * noctis , a dedicated salvaging ship that can tractor beam to 80km and gets a bonus to salvaging cycle time . 
  it 's basically the default level 4 / belt/anomaly hoover . 
  * faction ships are now on the market, 
  * rockets got buffed making them non-shit . 
  * they finally managed to differentiate blueprint copies from original . 
  * the agent system got simplified . 
  there is only 4 divisions now : distribution ( 100 % courier ) , mining ( 100 % mining ) , security ( 100 % encounter ) , research ( 100 % research ) . 
  the old connections skills were removed ( and invested sp reimbursed ) and replaced by : distribution connections , mining connections and security connections . 
  they also removed the quality of agents . 
  now every agents is considered qual -20 accessibility wise and +20 regarding the rewards . 
  the security status of the system where agents are located still influence the rewards . 
  * onboard scanner ( to scan anomalies ) have now a 64 au range and 10 sec return timer . 
  * ships equipped with a jump drive can no longer use jump bridges ( except black ops ) . 
  ** crucible **, 
  * the result of ccp listening to its customers, 
  * patch notes are [ ridiculously long and awesome ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/updates/patchnotes.asp?newpatchlogid=3219 ), 
  * new battlecruisers, 
  * destroyer buff, 
  * siege module buff ( plus moros drone tweak ), 
  * new nebula backgrounds,
