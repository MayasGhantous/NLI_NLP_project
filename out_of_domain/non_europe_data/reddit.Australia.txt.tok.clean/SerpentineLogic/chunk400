  sure , why not . 
  all ? 
  fuck no . 
  pay her to pretend to be one , then . 
  it 's kinda like a crowdshared managed fund . 
  you put in $ 100 whenever , and you get a share of the managed fund 's performance . 
  after a point , the fees are more expensive than buying into a fund directly though . 
  i think it 's at around 2 or 3000 dollars , but obviously do your sums because i do n't keep up to date with the fees . 
  to the moon, 
  they do n't share match making pools either . 
  i paid for financial advice a year ago . 
  it saved me 90 % of the price just on savings to insurance cover and switching to a better super provider .

  yeah he basically said `` you have that under control . 
  come back when you encounter a situation you are n't sure about '',

  does that 90 % include all the times the vendor puts bad people on the project and does n't get called on it by the client ? 
  8 weeks later : no collapse . 
  colour me surprised ~, 
  ok , to elaborate :, 
  if you leave the hecs debt :, 
  * -20 k in hecs , costing y % interest since it 's indexed . 
  * 20k in bank account earning x % interest ( which is taxable , although as a student that tax rate is low ), 
  * depending on what x vs y is , you * might * earn a couple of hundred bucks a year net . 
  if you pay off the debt :, 
  * 0 in hecs, 
  * 1k in bank account , representing guaranteed 5 % discount . 
  perhaps the most reasonable options would be either pay down the debt and pocket that 5 % , or look for a better place to put that $ 20k . 
  it 's taxable at your mrginal rate , which just happens to be zero atm . 
  in 5 years time , hopefully it 's not zero any more . 
  as far as whether that 's the full amount or not , that 's not important . 
  you only have the option of the 5 % discount on this year 's balance , so you do n't have a choice later . 
   experience comes with life , kind of automatically . 
  actually no . 
  i have met a lot of people who claimed to have 10 years experience doing something , when in fact they had the same year , ten times . 
   experience come with life , * kind of automatically *, 
   * if you give a shit * , experience comes with time . 
  they ca n't both be corect, 
  why not ? 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aware , but many countries throughout the middle east have had famous artifacts moved out of their country over the centuries . 
  it 's a bit of a sore point . 
  perhaps he just wants his local museum to have stuff relevant to the local area . 
  hk is just convenient ; they could easily switch cities if they wished .

  on the other hand , you 'll be able to pick up some cool skills to compensate for what you 're missing . 
  like , teaching yourself how to cook thai or french cuisine , or picking up horseriding or 4wding or fencing from people you meet .

  well ... 
  if you commend ( or report ) someone in-game , you get to choose a category , and maybe write a message if you feel inclined . 
  you also get to see how many reports or commends you have left before you click enter . 
  commending someone out of game is basically just an upvote . 
  pharmacists are stuck between the roles of `` pharmaceutical consultant '' and `` shopkeeper of a pill store '' . 
  i guess they 're just trying to keep control of the first bit , because coles or woolies would eat their lunch on the second bit .

  tldr very easy to get in top 50 % just by doing obvious things ; even top 25 % is achievable without a lot of luck .

  well , with the retarded 4-hour voting lines those guys seem to have , easy access to a snag seems like a really good idea . 
  it does n't * have * to be a snag ; if some enterprising yank wants to rock up with a hot dog stall or taco truck or whatever americans prefer , that 's totally fine . 
  nyt [ called it ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/elections/forecast/president ) 87 % . 
  aud is up 1.5 c against the greenback . 
  well , each state chooses how they run their election . 
  that means they get to choose how much to budget for polling booths . 
  which means they get to choose which areas get lots of polling booths , and which do n't . 
  so that means that elected officials can make lines really long in districts where people vote against them , and really short in districts that are friendly to them .

  they built a firewall , and made audota pay for it . 
  her boss is fucking over her friends . 
  she owes it to them to speak up , even if it 's anonymously and to the ombudsman not the boss . 
  at this point , i 'd also recommend taking screenshots of your pay data from the accounts app in case monetary amounts ~ mysteriously change ~ .

  he is on record mentioning how good looking his daughters are , so he 's at least keeping up with donald . 
  yes i know , the headline is terrible . 
  but hey , finally a state in the us gets to sample some of that sweet , sweet democracy 2.0 that the rest of the world has been eating for years . 
   approved : a new way of voting, 
  residents voted on a ballot question that promised to bring the ranked choice style of voting , also known as `` instant runoffs , '' to the state . 
  ranked choice voting allows voters to rank multiple candidates on the ballot . 
  ballots are then counted at the state level in multiple rounds in which last-place candidates are eliminated until a candidate wins by a majority . 
  supporters have said the change would give voters more voice . 
  skeptics have described the system as potentially slow and confusing . 
  bottle this feeling .
