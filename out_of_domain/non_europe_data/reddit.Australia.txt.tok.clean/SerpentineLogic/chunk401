  hoard it like it 's a precious gem , and use it to help change your country for the better . 
  it has been said that america has `` freedom to '' , while other countries have `` freedom from '' . 
  in the states , you have the freedom ** to ** be a rebel , the freedom ** to ** practice an religion , the freedom ** to ** be an arsehole , etc. 
  in australia , you have the freedom * from * being shot , the freedom * from * dodgy businesses , the freedom * from * electoral fraud etc. 
  obviously you can reword any `` freedom to '' to be a `` freedom from '' and vice versa , but the country tends to think one way more than the other . 
  you got ta hit rock bottom first , i guess . 
  part of the problem is that australia has so many incoming lanes that need to merge right . 
  that makes it much easier to just stay in the middle lane and let the mergers and the left-laters fight it out . 
  in other countries ( like germany ) , the incoming lane becomes the new lane , and the far lane has to merge back to the middle . 
  this means that people tend to pack into the outside lanes because they will stay around the longest , and the inside lane is used for overtaking , but people do n't stay there long because they know it will disappear in a few km when the next exit comes up .

  learndota should use the same bot that truedota2 uses to add dota buff links and mmr as flair . 
  then we would n't need polls . 
  you say that like zoning out while driving is something to encourage ... 
  well , do you plan to spend that money before you turn 70 ? 
  well , if the third party candidate directs his electors to vote for someone else , you 'd have a clear winner while still extracting concessions for your party . 
  have you watched purge coaching storm players ? 
  he really goes into the minutiae of how to clear a wave using the least mana and time . 
  less mana needed = more gold = faster bloodstone, 
  plus a lot more vanguards being built, 
  they do work when you disconnect / ragequit , so there 's that . 
  is the particular city or town important ? 
  labor 's mess, 
  thanks obummer, 
  like a chinese anti-valentine 's day . 
  the date was chosen because 1 is the loneliest number , 
  it 's smaller than subway in the us . 
  in fact , australia is probably mcdonalds ' most successful country . 
  drink crown lager and pretend it 's a blue can . 
  first * entire * state . 
  it has been used before in certain cities and counties . 
  literally the same thing mate, 
  noped out and drove in today . 
  there 's something seriously wrong with your office . 
  get out while you still can . 
  i think the tpp is a bad deal for australia . 
  i 'd be wary about tariffs though . 
  it 's likely to fuck ** us ** way more than the other countries . 
  in fact , a lot of products . 
  acorns stops becoming worth it after a couple of thousand dollars invested . 
  after that you 're better off buying into the funds directly . 
  if you want diversification , vgs is a good place to start . 
  the msci world ex-australia index gives you exposure to the rest of the world ( barring developing economies ) at a good ratio based on the size of their stock markets :, 
  japan 9.0 %, 
  united kingdom 7.2 %, 
  france 3.7 %, 
  germany 3.4 %, 
  switzerland 3.4 %, 
  etc, 
  ofc you need a long-term outlook to invest this way - if you need the money in 2 years you ca n't guarantee that the world 's economy will be up or down when you want to cash out . 
  nah it was fine - it 's just not really the sort of thing you plough $ 15k into . 
  fyi : thoughtworks is recruiting it consultants . 
  so , what 's your early farming item ? 
  mask of madness ? 
  ( how effective is yasha for farming anyway ? ), 
  i like the * idea * of lance , but not the reality . 
  it does n't work well with split shot ( split shot gets no extra range ) , and the stats are n't really worth detouring from the plan . 
  better to build a damage amp item instead , imo . 
  just remember not to go over $ 30k/year in compulsory + salsac super contributions . 
   how can i best go about placing this money so that it performs better ( but still conservative ) than it has over the time-frame of 7-10 years ? 
  model your portfolio on a less-conservative fund ? 
  conservative is 70 % income , 30 % growth . 
  balanced is 50 % income , 50 % growth . 
  if you want something in between , choose ratios in between . 
  i really could n't say . 
  if you 're worried , put that part of the money in a high interest saver account . 
  at least you 'll get 2-3 %, 
   honestly when in history has a multi millionaire who made their living from real estate been considered a saviour of the working class by granting better pay , conditions , and protectionism ? 
  how about [ steel magnate into philanthropist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrew_carnegie#1901.e2.80.931919:_philanthropist ) ? 
  having said that , i do n't think trump has it in him to do that . 
  he seems intent on taking it all with him . 
  trump picked up poor ( white ) voters that clinton lost . 
  also , black voters did n't turn up to vote for clinton in the same numbers they did for obama . 
  moderate left is fine . 
  machiavellian left is not . 
  it 's 60 % us stocks though . 
  you ca n't afford 4000 gold in two farming items with no survivability . 
  melbourne is a great city . 
  hope it works out the way you want and you 'll learn what a flat white should taste like . 
  the only pattern i have seen is certain times of the day are good for ranked matches , and other times are not . 
  i have seen 457 visa holders get paid a third of their on shore counterparts . 
  that 's obviously not equitable . 
  on the other hand , if the option is between paying that guy a third of the going rate for on shore , or a tenth of that rate for offshore ... well , either way that job is not going to the local . 
  the * country * does . 
  those guys who own a boat but do n't own a fish farm ? 
  different situation . 
  do n't forget the concern trolls . 
  his moustache game does * not * compare to tom selleck . 
  they were n't raking it in much more than when times were normal . 
  that 's what the [ mrr tax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minerals_resource_rent_tax ) was ** for ** ; to take a share of the super-profits that the mining companies were enjoying in those years . 
  it 's weird that the version of the same tax is fine for oil companies , but not fine for iron ore companies . 
  perhaps the oil companies should have spent millions of dollars on advertising , too . 
   i do n't believe we can ignore the decline of somewhere like venezuela , particularly given how significant natural resources were to their economy . 
  venezuela 's problem is that its leader is a fucking nutjob . 
  end of . 
  well , there is some neat tricks you can do with that . 
  like , instead of the illusions doing 20 % damage , they do 40 % damage , but have 50 % miss chance . 
  buy a mkb and they do twice as much damage . 
  that 's kinda cool . 
  i 'm 100 % happy that governments get to levy taxes on extracting stuff from the land under its control .
