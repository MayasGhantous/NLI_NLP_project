  in fact , some chinese restaurants will substitute goat ( sh\u0101ny\u00e1ng - literally ` mountain sheep ' ) for lamb ( y\u00e1ng ) in hot pots for this reason . 
  settle down , mister orange president . 
  i no longer buy seafood that was n't caught here . 
  it 's disappointing that global trade has come to this . 
  shh bby is ok, 
  last time i checked i was only flying domestically . 
  2241 miles or so . 
  fucken well played mate, 
  that 's not a predicate . 
  * not * pretty far from 90 % of the population though . 
  you are the real hero . 
  australian dividends and franking means that it 's attractive to bias domestically more than internationally . 
  aside from that , it 's pretty much the same, 
  * get a domestic fund or two, 
  * get a couple of international funds ( either eu vs us , or developed vs emerging , or both if you 're keen idk ), 
  * get some defensive products or niche stuff to suit your needs, 
  * speculate with some favourite stocks using some ** throwaway ** cash , just for fun, 
  personally , i kept a 2 fund strategy ( domestic + international ) until they were both  $ 25k . 
  the diversification just was n't worth the brokerage and hassle , plus it made rebalancing easy . 
  hey * you 're * the one trying to argue that there 's no water source within strolling distance . 
  if you 're still in the free brokerage period then probably . 
  otherwise maybe . 
  $ 1000 at 1 % interest is $ 10/year , right ? 
  so if you can get 1 % better interest in a hisa than in bonds , you break even on the brokerage after 12 months , and it 's still in a defensive position which you always need a bit of in your portfolio . 
  maybe one of those new escape rooms all the youngsters are talking about . 
  yeah . 
  increased yield can offset the cost of switching an investment . 
  it 's often hard to * find * increased yield - especially guaranteed increased yield , but hisa are very safe and their yield is a known quantity . 
  look at some of the common breakdowns on that bogle site you mentioned . 
  check what percentage they allocate to emerging markets . 
  you may find that , at your current portfolio level , the emerging market fraction might be too small to be worth it . 
  oh , must have been the other guy . 
  there have been a couple of similar posts in the last day or so . 
  since 6.81 ikr, 
  no worries . 
  remember : i 'm just a ~ ~ dog ~ ~ guy on the internet , not [ your uncle ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ausfinance/comments/330q3m/your_lazy_uncles_guide_to_investing/ ) or anything . 
  simplistic , but worth thinking about . 
  also , quelling blade is not a stupid pick up on morphling . 
  if you go full agility you should pick up raindrops though . 
  it 's boring , but vge . 
  next up will be something for small caps domestically . 
  probably one that tracks an index of small caps that distribute dividends , which cuts out a lot of shit stocks . 
  ca n't pact if you 're silenced already . 
  and once you get out of gust , drow is in a lot of trouble . 
  perhaps now , but that was n't the case 20 years ago . 
  there 's nothing like the atmosphere of a music festival full of people on e. 
  no , more something like mvs . 
  note that this turns all that money into unreliable gold . 
  also works on silencer since his e provides vision for a few seconds . 
  you 're both right . 
  * lots of energy companies are cheaper than agl, 
  * lots of energy companies * are not * ( especially on the suggested plans ), 
  both types doorknock . 
  also , pretty sure deso does n't work on your illusions . 
  yeah , but shadow blade is way more effective at low mmrs too . 
  it balances out . 
  especially since cmc can send trades straight to sharesight if you set it up ( easiest way is to set up sharesight through the cmc website after you have your account ), 
  hung gar and other shaolin-derived southern styles do arm conditioning using [ wooden dummies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mu_ren_zhuang ) . 
  the idea is that blocking strikes with your arms should hurt the attacker more than you , because, 
  * you 're mentally prepared for the pain from training, 
  * your arm bones are conditioned enough to physically block, 
  * your arm muscles ( and wrists ) are conditioned from using [ iron rings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_rings ) - some blocks will block with bone - most will block with muscle . 
  i 've toyed with picking up a semi-casual oov on pl since the change . 
  i mean , skadi on pl is legit so it 's not a waste . 
  it 's just hard to find the slot , what with, 
  * pms, 
  * quelling into diffusal, 
  * boots, 
  there 's a difference between `` we usually pay you on the last day of the month '' vs `` we * must * pay you on the last day of the month '' . 
  it depends entirely on your contract terms . 
  he 's talking fiber to the basement of a block of flats kind of deal . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm just a casual student , this was enlightening for me . 
  hire whoever the chinese casters use . 
  i believe a bicycle spoke to the spinal cord is traditional . 
  a bit greedy but if you get to 1500 gold early and you know the game will go late , then i guess it 's an option . 
  perhaps the hacker called four chan could have a quiet word with him . 
  final year as in you graduate in a few weeks ? 
  all the good solutions require a lot of gold . 
  perhaps the best tactic is to split push and avoid being anywhere near sk , since you 're a liability in a team fight . 
  and remember that plans change . 
  i went into first year planning on a career in aero engineering . 
  ended up with an electronics/computer systems degree . 
  how about both ? 
  definitely . 
  i know people who were forced to go to the us to arrange surrogacy . 
  i do n't know exactly how much it cost but i 'd be surprised if there was any change from $ 50k ( i doubt the surrogate more than about $ 15k - the rest went to fees , travel costs and medical bills/insurance ), 
  being able to do this domestically would have been a lot less hassle , and frankly , less risk . 
  does [ cleverman ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/cleverman/ ) count ? 
  case in point : singapore . 
  and remember that you only get one ausssie wh visa ever . 
  not everyone shares your opinion . 
  surrogacy is for people who would prefer their own kids over adoption , as is their right , just like people are totally allowed to buy dogs from a breeder rather than pick one up from the pound . 
  that explains some things she hinted at the time . 
  depends on how much escape you have , and whether you have an item advantage . 
  i mean , a farmed np will orchid and desolator you to death 1 vs 1 if you 're not farmed . 
  split pushing supports are a different beast . 
  you need to choose your hero wisely so you have push capability . 
  so , kotl , np , shadow shaman , beast master etc. 
  most have the ability to push a lane and escape , or push a lane safely using illuminate or wards .
