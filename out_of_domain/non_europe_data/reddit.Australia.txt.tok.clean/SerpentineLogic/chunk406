  but seriously , who * does n't * like money ? 
  it 's fucking awesome . 
  that 's not a crazy as it sounds . 
  the problem with soul ring is that its a waste of mana . 
  oo by itself is 100 mana ( waste of 50 mana , takes 50 seconds to regain that mana because you have low regen ), 
  oo+p ta is 210 mana ( net cost = 60 mana ) . 
  at that point , you might as well have bought the bottle :, 
  oo + bottle ( net cost = 40 mana , plus free 90 health ) . 
  in comparison , an ogre can always use up the entire 150 mana because he has bloodlust , and he has a higher base regen so he regens the lost health in half the time . 
  i 'd only go soul ring if you really could n't leave lane to get runes , or you were against some kind of cancerous laner like warlock where you end up maxing w anyway . 
  noob . 
  go dazzolator first . 
  i played a game yesterday where i was forced into getting a wand ( bristle turned up in my lane unexpectedly ) . 
  the amount of value i got from the wand , even when bb was n't around , was really surprising , especially the mana boost . 
  being able to pick up an instant 200 health * + 200 mana * is way better than i thought . 
  lots of orbs do . 
  is the usa the only country that cans pumpkin ? 
  it does if you 're not on salary . 
  holy shit you ca n't say that in english . 
  only in cantonese, 
  i get paid for each billable hour i work . 
  well , * we * did get knifed in the back . 
  were you really cleaning out all three lanes plus jungle though ? 
  are you * sure * it 's a tax deduction ? 
  that pay is a very low percentage of your charge out rate . 
  i would expect to get 70-85 % of what i am charged out at . 
  that just means that you can claim voluntary contributions * after * the fact , rather than needing it to be salary sacrificed beforehand . 
  if you do so , it counts towards the $ 25k cap . 
  so , not really much of a benefit unless you are n't able to salary sacrifice it . 
   you 're not going to take 75 % of the loss , why should you take 75 % of the whole package ? 
  if you 're charging out people at $ 2000/day but paying your staff $ 440/day , then you * do not deserve your staff * . 
  if it helps you understand the ruling better , replace `` bitcoin '' with `` bars of gold '' . 
  you 're confusing two things : purchases in foreign currencies , and purchases that are n't known to the ato ( whether overseas or not ) . 
  for the first , the ato considers the cost to be the equivalent amount in aud at the time of purchase . 
  fr the second , the ato does n't know , but will be quite upset when it finds out you have n't declared it on your tax return . 
  this is the kind of thing that can get your past 7 years of tax returns audited . 
  also , there 's it bosses inside all companies . 
  i mean , how many decent-sized companies could survive without an it department ? 
   i 'm in a reasonably senior role and work with the big msps all the time . 
  you should be fine . 
  msps will easily do the easiest 85 % of what any role entails . 
  if you can prove that you can do the entire 100 % , plus show you can work with ( and implicitly , manage ) a blended onshore/offshore team , then you wo n't have any problem getting a position . 
  most of the companies i have worked for now have large offshore development arms through msps and it 's interesting to watch the same mistakes happen to each of them , and it all boils down to poor vendor management throughout all levels of the business . 
  being able to say `` i can manage a vendor at individual and team level '' is a non-trivial advantage . 
  it 's actually a good thing to have the kind of person who could get a 457 visa to immigrate to australia , * provided the visa program is n't being manipulated * . 
  * already skilled and educated, 
  * generally fairly young, 
  * clear demand for their skills ( otherwise they would n't get the visa in the first place ), 
  * gon na pay lots of tax, 
  the problem is that when the 457 visa program is corrupted , the types of people hired under it change , and may not be the same quality . 
  because business . 
  so would you have someone on a 457 visa for that $ 120k ? 
  or would you offer $ 60k and consider it a good deal for all concerned ? 
  i 'm not knocking you for offering $ 60k ; it makes perfect sense from a business point of view , but it 's not what the 457 visa was supposed to be for . 
  he 's not joking . 
  or maybe pay them fairly so there 's an even playing field . 
  are they being paid roughly equivalently to your other colleagues ? 
  if so , yours is not the type of company everyone is complaining about . 
  ok but what about the next $ 5k ? 
  fees are ongoing so you will pay each year , indirectly . 
  i 'm no expert but this sounds like more trouble than it 's worth , and probably wo n't work the way you intend anyway . 
  a cuz . 
  not much is relevant to australia though . 
  i mean , i have no dog in the fight between some guys 700 years ago . 
  i applaud your scepticism , but that 's not the way i 'd bet . 
  and a shit tonne less risky . 
  halberd too , although it probably gets purged when he uses q. 
  i 've only encountered a few casual racists over the years . 
  most have been full time racists . 
  not if you trade options . 
  still , very close to gambling for a living . 
  * no guaranteed hours of racism, 
  * usually racist at irregular times, 
  * can stop being racist with no notice period,

  have they no self respect ? 
  also : not paying , or underpaying super is a sign that a company is in financial trouble but does n't want to tell anyone ( if they are above-board , they 'll usually free up money by telling people to take annual leave ) . 
  start looking for work elsewhere , because they 're either about to go under , or they 'll steal your pay to prevent going under ( or both ), 
  especially because of the shady past , there may be hidden parts to the documents , e.g. 
  `` btw you are not just a shareholder , you now assume 5 % of all the debts '', 
  `` shareholders suing the company may not ask for more than $ 1000 damages '', 
  or something equally shady . 
  it 's not just a guaranteed 4 % . 
  it 's a * tax-free * 4 % , which is probably closer to 5.7 % yield . 
  i 'm all for investing in the market , but that 's actually a pretty good rate of return for effectively zero risk , and probably more than vgb will ever provide you . 
  as far as brokers go , cmc is pretty popular if you do n't already have a bank account with a particular bank already ( commonwealth for commsec , nab for nabtrade etc ) . 
  i use cmc and i have no complaints .

  might not answer all your questions , but it will give you an idea of what to investigate , and what criteria you should be looking for . 
  personally , i would * not * go with options unless you know what you 're doing . 
  casual staff generally do n't get annual leave . 
  it 's factored into their higher per-hour rate .
