  how much is the break fee if you switch out after 3 years ? 
  do i look like i have a crystal ball ? 
  either way you need that mortgage paid off otherwise you wo n't get another loan , so you may as well prioritise it . 
  ok , a more conservative approach is, 
  * pay off mortgage entirely , close off the loan, 
  * take out investment loan against the house ( let 's say 50 % of the price , idk ), 
  * use that money to buy shares or whatever ( keep the rest in an offset account ), 
  * investment loan is now tax deductible unlike your old loan, 
  * hopefully the investments pay for the loan repayments, 
  * if not , well i guess you have accidentally negative geared until they do . 
  unless you 're a lawyer , then neither of us know for sure . 
  or too much [ / r/videos ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5c0r01/polish_legends_operation_basilisk_eng_subs/ ), 
  that 's expected to drop . 
  it 's a * cure * , not a lifetime treatment program . 
  well the cheapest , most expedient thing would be to do the phillipines thing and execute them in the street . 
  i 'm happy to pay for the privilege of treating people * like people * , because that 's the kind of country i want to live in . 
   we 're already quite close to having the technology to identify anyone who enters the store , connect to their smartphone/whatever and track what they 've taken off their shelves . 
  case in point : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrmmk1myrxc, 
  if there 's a review you really want , it 's definitely worth subscribing to choice for a while . 
  the last time i subbed was for a stroller review . 
  there 's lots of reviews out there but choice was miles ahead in the depth they went - testing against australian standards , checking how stable they were , looking for places that little fingers could get caught when opening or closing them . 
  it might be expensive just for one review , but you get access to all the other reviews as well , so we ended up using it a couple of months later before buying a cordless vacuum cleaner and a few other things . 
  come to think of it , this time of the year is probably when most people need them the most . 
   do you also think that the australian carriers would be able to compete with overseas carriers should any changes be introduced, 
  if there 's an industry-wide accc ruling , it might also end up being a condition for those airlines to sell to aussies . 
  i guess his point is that the ` tourism dollars ' from these types of tour are much less than you 'd expect . 
  so , more tourist volume is offset by lower revenue per tourist . 
  i thought the max you could get was 6 months unless you had a us passport ( which lets you get multiple-entry visa for 10 years ), 
  do n't look at me , i 'm just the explainer . 
  ok , so if your loan is 4 % , that 's your after-tax saving , right ? 
  each $ 100 extra you put into the loan saves you $ 4/year ( compounding of course ) . 
  so , what amount of pre-tax interest would you need to match that ? 
  well it depends on your tax bracket . 
  say you 're on $ 90k . 
  that means your marginal tax rate is 37 % . 
  so that $ 4 is ( 100-37 ) = 63 % of the pre-tax sum . 
  so , 4 / 0.63 = $ 6.349 pre-tax . 
  ( if you were in the 32.5 % tax bracket it would be $ 5.92 ), 
  is there a possibility of getting a new card and doing an interest-free balance transfer from the $ 9700 one ? 
  just 6 months interest free on that sum would save you $ 500 + . 
  ( which also means it 's better to pay off the other cards first ), 
  oh my god , pajamil , you ca n't just ask someone why they 're white . 
  which is amusing , since american culture is now swinging the other way - being tanned implies you can go away on holidays all the time . 
  why not just add people you enjoy playing with to your steam friends list after a game ? 
  maybe he tops from the bottom, 
  they can still use non-prime matchmaking . 
  what exactly is she trying to do ? 
  the hard bit about a housing market collapse wo n't be finding a cheap house ; it will be keeping your job so you can afford to buy . 
  p2p lending has never been hardened by bad economic conditions , so it 's too early to tell . 
  however , they 're unlikely to have the same level of protection that banks do . 
  leaving aside the tax implications , you are * crazy * to transfer any serious amount of money without an agreement that you 'll get it back , especially when it 's not a blood relative . 
  any lawyer can whip up an `` repayment on request , zero interest '' loan agreement in an hour ( there are web sites you can get templates from if you 're too cheap to even do that ) and then you 're safe . 
  it 's not even his kids , it 's his defacto son in law . 
  the political party uses the american spelling as a historical shout out . 
  and after that is blown through , then what ? 
  nobody knows . 
  i used to be a trader before i took an arrow to the knee . 
  you pretty-much need to pool resources as a couple to save up for a house now . 
  like , live off one income and save the rest . 
  i like how you think . 
  december 46th , 2016 . 
  if your marginal tax rate is above 15 % , you will need to pay the extra to the ato . 
  vanguard funds are n't actively managed . 
  they invest in the underlying vanguard etfs in set ratios , and handle rebalancing automatically . 
  note that there is some double taxation in veu , since the fund has income that 's foreign to the us as well as australia , so the fund pays 15 % and you pay the full tax amount too . 
  that 's why you need a financial adviser . 
  i mean , at your income level , you 're losing $ 80/day just because you do n't have a corporation or trust to park income in ( like doctors do ) . 
  certainly not avocados ... 
  which is ironic since even nescafe is better than american drip filter coffee . 
   if you make all your isk doing boring shit that you eventually come to hate , that isk grows exponentially in value because you will want to avoid doing the boring shit again . 
  [ ... ] establishing passive income solves [ this issue ] as the pilot is now making isk with a positive personal value . 
  isk will no longer have a negative personal value associated with boring work . 
   eve is not just about making isk , but knowing how to lose it well .

  you have n't been paying attention . 
  once espresso was mastered , they went onto artisanal drip filtered coffee . 
  ok , they did a detour into deconstructed espresso , but everyone soon realised that was a shithouse idea . 
  well , yeah . 
  that fund is basically `` 100 % vas , minus a bit of cash for when people cash out of the fund '', 
  there are others that are a mix of etfs though . 
  on the other hand , illusions with pms are way tankier because of the same reason : damage block happens before amp or reduction . 
  do you want to invest directly in the property market ? 
  buying a flat is much like buying shares in a single company - you get more choice of investment , but all your eggs are in one basket . 
  alternatively , there are property-oriented lics ( listed investment companies ) that you can buy into on the stock market , to get a share of all the investments they have under their control . 
  this often includes stuff that you ca n't afford to buy into directly , like office blocks , warehouses etc. 
  if you want to spread the risk further than what 's inside a lic , then you can go for a property-based index like vanguard vap . 
  this `` gim me a bit of everything '' approach has paid huge dividends over the years , but by taking a `` whole of market '' spread , you also lose all choice about what exact properties to invest in ( this might be a good idea though - personally i 'm terrible at picking winners from houses or shares ), 
  would you be happy getting that apprentice wage for your entire working life tho ? 
  perhaps turn on public match data and look on opendota - it will estimate your mmr , and estimate the mmr of players you are matched with . 
  it 's not very accurate at low mmrs because so few people put their mmr on their profile ( and expose public match data ) but it 's better than nothing . 
  i was matched against some smurfs a few days ago . 
  you know the ones - 600 ranked mmr , 600 + gpm . 
  even though they were cutting through ranked players like butter , they still ` only ' had a 85 % win rate - and that 's while smurfing against players 3000 mmr less than them . 
  tldr ; some games you just ca n't win . 
  looks like an opinion poll chart, 
  that 's pretty low . 
  where i live , slots must return 85 % + in pubs and clubs , and 90 % + in casinos . 
  what 's the itemisation for bf jugg , then ? 
   everything i 've heard is that 1k-2k ranked might as well be unranked , only more toxic and hard to get out of .
