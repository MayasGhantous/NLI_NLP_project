   a marriage alliance spokesman said a volunteer had handed out the flyers , and it was not part of an official campaign . 
   `` this was not an action that was part of a campaign from marriage alliance and is not condoned or endorsed by marriage alliance , '' he said . 
   `` this action was taken by an individual ** who has since been contacted regarding this matter ** . '', 
  `` hey bevan . 
  about those flyers you handed out . '', 
  `` yeah ? '', 
  `` spot on , bevan . '', 
  not strictly `` bell potter '' . 
  more like `` a man working for bell potter '' . 
  you get downvotes because you 're just talking * at * us instead of talking * to * us . 
   australia is a mix of both given our location , population size , resources and capabilities . 
  i would say our immigration policies are * firmly * on the the side of `` be productive or gtfo '', 
  i 'm all for hard work and self-improvement , but please do n't say things as if the [ just world fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=just_world_fallacy ) is true . 
  i disagree . 
  like the west wing , sometimes you just want to watch a tv show where politicians are actually * good at something * . 
  might be statesmanship ; might be machiavellian realpolitik . 
  just something . 
  i do n't care if malcolm puts it in a barrel and * burn it * . 
  the company misled the country to make that money , and they do not * deserve * to keep it . 
  i do n't think manufacturing is as big a thing in australia . 
  it 's more about mining and primary industries . 
  note that we 're coming off a mining boom and there are not as many jobs running a mine as there were setting it up . 
  it will be interesting seeing what those people do next . 
  they thought they were swimming in the ocean , they were just * going through the motions * ... 
  not everywhere . 
  yes . 
  uber self regulates . 
  more to the point , it self regulates its drivers in a way that the taxi industry does not . 
  different people . 
  no , the primary target get hit by both effects . 
   you could just pop manta in lane and retreat to jungle and your illusions would push in pretty decently ** since they can proc ** which really boosts damage output . 
  i assume you mean proccing the mjolnir active right ? 
  because i do n't think illusions proc lightning . 
   one big reason for the high cost of coal power is the lack of infrastructure ( transmission lines ) , not the price of coal . 
  do n't forget that , while india has a fair bit of coal , it does not have a reliable rail system to transport it to the power stations that would need it ( if it did , then they 'd * already * have a bunch of coal-fired power stations ), 
  so , if there 's 2 expensive hurdles to coal-fired electricity generation , but pv power offers an alternative way to slowly scale up , it 's an attractive option . 
  monorail !, 
  i prefer the sequel : will happily swap for larger sizes, 
  ( bearing in mind that at least a few of those 5-star reviews are fake , as you 'd expect from the internet ), 
  see you at fuck youj, 
  well , he does have his e , so he has that over other supports . 
  in contrast , one place i worked always made sure their accountants took their annual leave , and in large chunks at a time , for fraud-detection purposes . 
  same for me , except it 's lwop . 
  vr , camera drones , web site . 
  it 's doable . 
  it really sucks getting -15 fps compared to 6 . x , especially when i only had 30fps to start with . 
  ok then , shares are probably a decent choice then . 
  if it were only 2 years , probably better to put into high interest savings account . 
  well , if australia goes into recession but the rest of the world is fine , it 's good to have some investments where the money comes from international sources . 
  going 50/50 australia/international is a simple approach but it 's also a shitload better than 100/0 or having no actual strategy at all . 
  you can always change it later once you feel strongly one way or another . 
  the important thing is : are * you * willing to work for the ( abysmal ) salary they 're offering ? 
  mate , nobody wants to cut off the supply of awesome employees . 
  what people ** do ** want is :, 
  * awesome 457 visa holders should be paid an average-to-awesome wage ( wiggle room because of their extra hiring/relocation/visa / hassle costs ), 
  * bad-but-cheap 457 visa holders * should not get visas in the first place * . 
   some people here on separate threads would rather cut off 457s altogether . 
  i guess their preference would be for the pre-457-style sponsorship agreements . 
  probably more of a hassle , but you have to remember that 457 was sold to us as a short-term , ` critical shortage ' work visa . 
  i can see both sides to the argument , and it 's something worth discussing . 
   how do these guys get hired then ? 
  company contacts offshore provider and says `` i need 200 offshore developers '' . 
  ( this is fine ), 
  company receives 200 offshore developers of mixed quality ( this is fine ), 
  company decides it wants some onshore developers to coordinate with the business , and to prevent communication-related fuckups that now happen regularly ( this is fine ), 
  offshore provider sends some developers over on 457 visas, 
  ** crucially ** : those developers are * still much cheaper * than hiring someone locally who is equally-good , but never get the chance to become a permanent staff member of the parent company because it would cost the company more money to hire them than keep 457ing them . 
  the last point is what people complain about . 
  where do you see the dollar going over the next 1-2 years ? 
  i do n't have to ask myself ; i asked the 457 visa-holders i know . 
  they want a path to permanent residency , but the fickle nature of their 457 visas are held over their heads - they 're easily replaced if they speak up , or do n't work stupid hours/weekends etc. 
  in addition , they ca n't even * low-ball * an offer to an australian company because of the extreme downward pressure that the 457 program has on the it industry . 
  drow safelane , medusa mid is a common pairing . 
  medusa has really bad damage application for a while , so getting an early boost helps her out . 
  later , dusa can wade into a teamfight and protect drow , and stone gaze means both of them can put out stupid dps while controlling the enemy position . 
  * is offlane lycan a thing , and what would his ability build be ? 
  * always vlads , sure , but what next ? 
  medallion or deso or necro or echo ? 
  only if you want to bias `` extra us '' . 
  the difference between vgs and vts/veu split is really minimal - vgs has slightly higher mer but also slightly higher returns due to how veu interacts with foreign tax law in the us and oz . 
  of course , you might also want to buy vts if you think that vgs has some sort of price spike for no reason , but idk if that 's a thing or not . 
  do you have transport ? 
  only a few percent , probably ( only 15 % of go card users hit 10 trips in a week ), 
  but , those who * did * abuse the system were probably motivated by needing to travel move zones , so they stood to save more money than the average person would . 
  well , you 'll need to get to customers ' houses * somehow * . 
  paying $ 3 each way for public transport will be a pain , especially if you need to carry stuff there and back . 
  i 'd ask whether you could borrow a car from a friend but you do n't have a license . 
  i 'm sure those views are valid for your slice of the industry , but do n't discount the possibility that other parts of it ( or other industries ) * do * experience sustained pressure from 457 abuse . 
   um then do something about it ? 
  that 's literally what this article is about - calling for change . 
  it 's simple calculs, 
  457 visa problems \u2283 457 visa problems in it, 
   457 visas holders residing in australia also blew-out to around 200,000 ( both primary and secondary ) , with many of these working in professions that are not consider to be particularly `` skilled '' , in short supply , or critical to the economy , such as cooks/chefs , cafe/restaurant staff , and customer service ( see next table ) . 
  so no , the thread is not * just * about it ; it 's a wider problem spanning different parts of many industries , each of which experiences varying effects of the visa program . 
  they even use it to treat malnutrition :, 
  your entire posting history on this thread boils down to `` my company does the right thing , so this problem does not exist '' . 
  if us economy heats up , that implies interest rate increases , which means our dollar drops , which means our exports are more profitable and foreign investment increases - is this counteracted by import costs rising , or is it a net boost to the economy ? 
  for me , the canonical source of whether an email is real or not is http://isemail.info . 
  that guy 's attention to detail is insane . 
   so if you fuck it up,
