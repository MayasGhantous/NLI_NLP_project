  so , yeah , a few things changed . 
  you will need some drone skills because battleships ca n't hit frigate-sized stuff easily . 
  t2 light drones should be sufficient , as long as you have a few skill levels in drone interfacing to buff them up a bit . 
  you should have t2 medium pulses before you get into a battleship , because you 'll be using them on your harbinger . 
  after you get into a battleship ( probably a geddon for starters ) you can train t2 large pulses , because you 'll probably be remapped per/will by then . 
   i hope to god they do n't fuck up my tristan 's highslot loadout . 
  they would have to try really hard to fuck it up further than it already is . 
  especially the t2 cdfes , but only t1 anti-em screen . 
  you may also want to train up some skills in the leadership skill tree . 
  even with them trained to a low level you can get an easy 6 % more armor and shield for you and your mate just by being squad commander . 
  it 's pretty clear that they identified a risk factor , and since they are n't made of money , they 'd rather lose x % of potential donors than pay $ y for extra blood screening . 
  if you visited britain during the mad cow disease outbreak it 's the same thing . 
  they did the sums and it 's just not worth the risk accepting your blood . 
   you are eligible to donate 6 months after receiving the tattoo . 
  this also applies to cosmetic tattooing . 
  yeah , i probably misremembered them that way . 
  so , he likes kids but could n't eat a whole one ? 
  probably some of the missing people on the cartons , as well . 
  looking at the photograph , i do n't blame them . 
  according to [ eve-central ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=29668&amp;usesystem=30000142 ) , it 's closer to 485m . 
  and the answer is : probably not . 
  if you have only recently contracted hiv , the tests are less accurate , hence the 12 month ban after doing something high-risk . 
  and after * that * , it 's worthless . 
  both caldari and amarr ships are good at long-range fire support , although the amarr battleships see much more pvp action than the caldari ones . 
  drakes are more popular in pvp than harbingers , but oracles are more popular than nagas due to more low slots to add dps modules to ( sniper ships generally have very light tank regardless ), 
  i 'd settle for a blowjob doctor . 
  if you do this , for fuck 's sake bring your own liquid ozone , 
  if you 're new and ca n't afford to constantly lose battlecruisers , put together a tanky little punisher and tackle hostile ships with your warp scrambler . 
  sure , you 'll lose lots of them , but they cost nothing to replace and if you can tackle something juicy for you fleet to kill you 'll be a hero , 
  well you can always sell it via contracts even if the stuff does n't get moved . 
  you can only accept a contract if you 're in the same region but you can set one up from anywhere . 
  it 's standings-based iirc . 
  something like this , i imagine,
