  all according to keikaku . 
  translators note : keikaku means plan . 
  they all have fees though . 
  for example , hostplus indexed balanced has a 3-year growth of 9 % , but it has $ 78.00 / year fees + 0.02 % mer . 
  that 's * really * good , but even 9 % interest wo n't pay for the fees if you only have $ 500 in the account .

  put a range support tower on it and it can shoot from the back of your base . 
  in fact , i usually put something like fire + lightning + ice towers clustered around a range support as my first few towers . 
  the extra range means they stay useful even after i put more towers in front in later levels . 
  right , so if the carrot of entitlements does n't work , the perhaps the stick will . 
  i also know people who wanted to claim , but since they had n't put any money into super for x years , they were rejected .

   strategy # 1 : ` time-only ', 
  when using the `` time-only '' strategy , the portfolio, 
  is rebalanced every day , month , quarter , or year ,, 
  and so on , regardless of how much or how little the, 
  portfolio 's asset allocation has drifted from its target . 
  as the strategy 's name implies , the only variable, 
  taken into consideration is time . 
  determining the, 
  frequency with which to rebalance the portfolio, 
  largely depends on the investor 's risk tolerance , the, 
  correlation of the portfolio 's assets , and the costs, 
  involved in rebalancing . 
  ( their stats show there 's little difference between monthly and yearly rebalances between stocks and bonds ), 
   strategy # 2 : ` threshold-only ', 
  the second strategy , `` threshold-only , '' ignores the, 
  time aspect of rebalancing . 
  investors following this, 
  strategy rebalance the portfolio only when the, 
  portfolio 's asset allocation has drifted from the, 
  target asset allocation by a predetermined minimum, 
  rebalancing threshold such as 1 % , 5 % , or 10 % ,, 
  regardless of the frequency . 
  the rebalancing events, 
  could be as frequent as daily or as infrequent as, 
  every five years , depending on the portfolio 's, 
  performance relative to its target asset allocation . 
  you need to monitor the ratios very regularly , and choose the threshold wisely . 
  they see little benefit to tight thresholds . 
   strategy # 3 : ` time-and-threshold ', 
  the final strategy discussed here , `` time-andthreshold , '', 
  calls for rebalancing the portfolio on a, 
  scheduled basis ( e.g. , monthly , quarterly , or annually ) ,, 
  but only if the portfolio 's asset allocation has drifted, 
  from its target asset allocation by a predetermined, 
  minimum rebalancing threshold such as 1 % , 5 % , or, 
  if , as of the scheduled rebalancing date , the, 
  portfolio 's deviation from the target asset allocation is, 
  less than the predetermined threshold , the portfolio, 
  will not be rebalanced . 
  likewise , if the portfolio 's, 
  asset allocation drifts by the minimum threshold or, 
  more at any intermediate time interval , the portfolio, 
  will not be rebalanced at that time . 
  note :, 
   after taking into consideration reasonable, 
  expectations regarding return patterns , average, 
  returns , and risk , we concluded that for most broadly, 
  diversified stock and bond fund portfolios , annual or, 
  semiannual monitoring , with rebalancing at 5 %, 
  thresholds , produces a reasonable balance between, 
  risk control and cost minimization . 
  and in conclusion, 
   as our analysis, 
  shows , the risk-adjusted returns are not meaningfully, 
  different whether a portfolio is rebalanced monthly ,, 
  quarterly , or annually ; however , the number of, 
  rebalancing events and resulting costs increase, 
  significantly . 
  as a result , we conclude that a, 
  rebalancing strategy based on reasonable monitoring, 
  frequencies ( such as annual or semiannual ) and, 
  reasonable allocation thresholds ( variations of 5 %, 
  or so ) is likely to provide sufficient risk control relative, 
  to the target asset allocation for most portfolios with, 
  broadly diversified stock and bond holdings . 
  so , if you want to make more regular investments , feel free ; just tidy up the ratios once a year and you 're gold . 
  but investing internationally is n't about currency changes . 
  it 's about diversification of markets . 
  if pfizer discovered the cure to cancer tomorrow , you 'd want in on it , even if the aud-usd rate stays unchanged . 
  right , and the entire point of index funds is that even experts are shit at consistently picking good and bad companies , so it 's safer to buy shares in a bunch of stocks and at least you 'll track the index . 
  yep , his family is from serbia .
