  $ 11 , or $ 1 for each $ 1000 in the trade - whichever is higher . 
  ok , once someone dies , you do that year 's tax return for them ( via paper - no electronic lodgement ) . 
  but , there 's also the concept of a deceased estate , which is all their stuff . 
  normally you do n't have to do a tax return for the estate because it probably does n't accrue enough income to breach the tax-free threshold before its assets are disbursed to the recipients . 
  if , however , you discover more income-producing assets later on , then you may have to a deceased estate tax return for the missing years . 
  idk , tell ato to update their web site then, 
   ** note : ** tax returns for a deceased person can only be lodged using a paper tax return .

  myrepublic is , though , and i 'm seriously considering switching to them when my contract ends . 
  i had to set up hero-specific hotkeys just for techies to do this . 
  ip insurance is tax-deductible so it 's not such a huge saving if it comes out of super . 
  that being said - index funds are really useful for spreading risk * within * a market . 
  i 'm conflicted about whether this is a good or bad thing : /, 
  you pick np and attack-move treants across a quarter of the map at a time , clearing them all out . 
  * you still pay 15 % tax into super, 
  * and it uses up salsac super cap that you might need, 
  * also ip inside super is less competitive than outside super, 
  * the coverages and options available to be offered via super are restricted by legislation , which exclude many options now commonly available outside of super . 
  * while super funds may be interested in the best insurance , there are significant transition costs, 
  * speaking of transition costs , it 's a pain to change super just because you do n't like the fund 's insurance option . 
  most people will stick with their super , and those that switch will switch due to the super itself . 
  the competitiveness of the insurance offering is way down on their priority list, 
  * on the other hand , keeping insurance and super separate means you can shop around for both independently . 
  why crucible over loam ?

  is it against the rules to throw in some [ lap chong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_sausage ) on top of the rice while it cooks ? 
  because my family has been doing that for at least 5 generations . 
  also , nobody in australia has chequebooks any more , except under duress . 
  wow i think i need to make a trip there, 
  is that the one where everyone finishes eating by , like 8pm ?

  it does * not * work . 
  generally your hero will say `` denied ! '', 
  well , the last time i saw someone write a cheque in australia was in the late 80 's . 
  i think it was never as popular as in the us during my lifetime because we had point-of-sale debit cards for [ basically my entire life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debit_card#australia ) . 
  i 'll set up a corp with tax rate of 19.9 %, 
  or , if you have the money like op mentioned , you can prepay your card by $ 40k and have a zero balance after you pay for the car . 
  wait who spends that on dog food ? 
  i 'm lucky to spend $ 400 a year , and i have a big dog . 
  ideally not unless you can lose a couple of them . 
  also , you can negotiate a cash discount, 
  reddit caught all seven of the two boston bombers . 
  yes . 
  plus health regen aura ( for you and your creep ), 
  dominator since it gives good regen to offset the fact you went treads , has an aura to support with ( bonus points for pink satyr for extra health regen ) , and you can eat the creep for huge mana . 
  but secretly you just want the attack speed and stats . 
  $ 20 gets me a 15kg bag of dog food ... 
  the number of people i saw at my local hospitals spinal unit who were there because they attempted suicide was heartbreaking . 
  the meta problem is that various solutions will compete in the car market . 
  wonder which type will sell and which wo n't . 
  no , the two term maximum was agreed upon before hand . 
  yeah , they 're not free , but last i checked they were < $ 50 per week . 
  paint your palette blue and grey,

   economic forecaster predicts modest housing correction, 
  updated thu at 5:55 pm, 
   australia 's east coast housing markets are likely to stagnate , or fall slightly , over the next few years , according to the latest predictions from bis shrapnel . 
  the economic forecaster is widely used by companies in the property sector , and warns that an apartment glut is likely to put downward pressure on prices in melbourne , brisbane and parts of sydney . 
  bis shrapnel 's managing director robert mellor says , with rents steady or falling , first home buyers are probably best advised to wait for a year or two until they can pick up a discounted apartment .

  that 's correct .

  when mirana ults , all heroes on her team get a buff that enemies can see ( its a little moon above their heads , near where spirit breaker charge would be ), 
  so if you see an enemy show anywhere on the map with a crescent moon symbol , you are probably seconds away from being ganked .

  but then you see what 's going on in north carolina and wish the federal government was stronger ( the laws have been changed so the state court can reject unfair electoral maps , but ca n't * force * the governor to make the next one fairer , so he just keeps submitting maps that will let his party win the next election ), 
  hey , people can change . 
  i mean , who has n't gone through an ayn rand phase , or said something incredibly cringey because you 're talking about stuff you have no experience about ? 
  the important thing is to keep the conversation going , because when someone retreats to an echo chamber , they shut themselves off from ever changing their mind . 
  there are reasons to change ( new suburbs mean too many people in one district etc ) but they 're done up by politicians and , well , they like to win . 
  i suggest you and your partner put 50 % of your ( after-tax ) salaries into separate savings accounts and try that for 6-12 months . 
  if you decide to buy a house , you 'll probably have to live off half your income while the other half goes into the mortgage ( with wiggle room because you 're not paying rent , but you 're likely to plough that money into the mortgage too ), 
  if you do n't decide to buy a house , then you should still make an effort to build up your savings accounts for emergencies and to invest with . 
  tokyo is notoriously hard to get permission to block off streets to film in . 
  investment bonds are lower yield but are tax-free after 10 years . 
  probably not worth it at this stage in your life , unless you really think you 'll be making 180k + when you 're 30 . 
  index funds are a very credible backbone of an investment portfolio . 
  i would be completely comfortable in having 50-70 % of my portfolio tracking indexes . 
  ok but in the * meantime * , 3 % means $ 57/week in guaranteed interest , while keeping your capital, 
  * safe, 
  * liquid, 
  i mean , that 's why there 's the concept of ` capital-stable investments ' - exactly for situations where you want to park money until you decide where to put it .
