  `` it 's too late to stop * anyway * '', 
  `` not russian , but # 1 with russians '', 
  building a portfolio of individual stocks ( based on the recommendation of a fi ) . 
  after * more than one * instance of `` this $ 10,000 investment is now worth < $ 1000 '' , i vowed never to hold more than 10 % of my entire portfolio in individual companies . 
  * open a high-interest savings account with a financial institution of your choice, 
  * transfer ( at least ) half your after-tax earnings into it each pay period, 
  * live off the rest, 
  * you now have a * capital-stable investment option * : this will probably be the lowest-risk part of your investment portfolio, 
  * work on your next steps , which will be other types of investments . 
  madness can not be dispelled by the user . 
  it still was flawed . 
  most of the complaints about weakening domestic laws on medicine , copyright etc were valid . 
  is n't there a bot that does this already ? 
  i mean i did n't set this flair myself, 
  the way trump seems to be at odds with the nsa , its a possibility . 
  more likely though , he will just cut off australia 's access to intel . 
  it died from many directions , not least the usa side after the election . 
  shorten is just taking credit . 
  sell things to robots duh, 
  a stopped clock etc etc. 
  with occasional vacations , public holidays etc , you should expect to * turn up to work * about 220 days per year . 
  if you 're getting paid $ 100k , then a contractor would consider that a $ 454 daily rate . 
  maybe start salary sacrificing $ 250/week into super . 
  easy yield . 
  i guess i 'll be choosing the other level 25 talent against am then . 
  yeah , definitely keep work and home purchases separate . 
  preferably with different banks to make it way easier to tell the difference . 
  it probably went ex-dividend earlier than today though . 
  the obvious approach is to use dollar cost averaging . 
  buy half now , and the other half in 6 months . 
  ivv tracks the us s&p 500 , which has , as you 'd imagine , the largest 500 companies in the states . 
  vts tracks the crsp us total market index , which has 3,568 companies . 
  is that better ? 
  worse ? 
  that 's up to you to decide . 
  my opinion of acorns remains unchanged - it 's an easy way to get someone into investing , but after a while you * will * outgrow it . 
  so , without authorisation , how did the money still get spent ? 
  so , probably about the same as the us then . 
  iceland keeps * detailed * genealogical records . 
  you could probably reconnect fairly easily if you are willing to reach out first . 
  i played against a smurf that was at least 2k better than me . 
  i got four last hits during the * entire * laning phase and was lucky to only die three times . 
  it was ** brutal ** . 
  2 melee mids is unusual though, 
  / r/creepsmirin, 
  australian here . 
  would replace our leader with him in a heart beat . 
  time investment ? 
  its a game . 
  you should be enjoying each game you play on the way up , otherwise you 'll be disappointed when you get to 3k and discover its the same game except your win rate dropped to 50 %, 
  btw after you reach 4 l start alternating with gatorade or something, 
  drinking too much without electrolyte balancing can kill you . 
  7 l is actually pretty marginal and i would n't recommend going that far very often . 
  you know all the times they said `` i 'm not here to be your friend ; i 'm here to be your * parent * '' ? 
  well now the tables have turned . 
  there 's a bit of human trafficking going on as well . 
  i do too have a boyfriend , but he goes to another school . 
  on the other hand , maybe they * do * know better . 
  i mean , my first day on the job , i was like `` which code should i modify ? 
  ` index.html.james ` , ` index.html .20041215 ` , ` index.html.tmp2 ` or what ? '', 
  it does n't take an expert to recognise the need for version control . 
  hmm , i guess a company that rejects employees that care too much about improving things would not be fun to work for anyway . 
  last time i did the sums , the crossover point was at a few thousand dollars , after which it would be cheaper to pull the entire sum out and invest directly . 
  afk cloaking bastards, 
  well its clear there 's a big far queue . 
  when you mention that you commended someone in the post game chat , it reminds other players to commend , and sometimes that means you pick up one as well . 
  black gold !, 
  texas tea !, 
  any bank * can * work - you just export your transactions to spreadsheet and import it manually whenever you want . 
   with a $ 1000 establishment fee, 
  i do n't think * that 's * conducive to using them for a month or two ... 
  at the end of the day , people are still people :(, 
  38 % is a huge hit . 
  it might actually be cheaper to swap to a low-fee option inside the super fund and just leave it in there . 
  it 's not a scam because they actually do things . 
  is it value for money ? 
  * fuck * no . 
  ouch . 
  double ouch . 
  there 's an argument to be made that ynab helps at tax time and thus might be tax-deductible . 
   you can claim a deduction for expenses you incur in managing your own tax affairs , including preparing and lodging your tax return and activity statements, 
  and then, 
   expenses relating to preparing and lodging your tax return and activity statements include the costs of :, 
   * buying tax reference material, 
   * lodging your tax return through a registered tax agent, 
   * obtaining tax advice from a recognised tax adviser ( a registered tax agent , barrister or solicitor ), 
   * dealing with us about your tax affairs . 
  so , i dunno . 
  looks like ynab might be like hiring a bookkeeper to go through your receipts . 
  if they were registered tax agents , then it would definitely be tax-deductible . 
  but if they * were n't * , i 'm not sure . 
  no he means kappapride . 
  how about places that are n't physically close , but are close logistically ? 
  for instance , west end is on the other side of the river but there 's a ferry , or fairfield , which has access to a bridge so you could ride to class . 
  and then there 's various bus routes which get you to other suburbs via a direct route .

  [ this article ] ( http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/07/what-you-should-know-if-you-want-to-work-remotely-and-travel-the-world/ ) is a bit light on details , but it seems to answer your questions, 
   digital nomads are subject to the same tax implications as someone who works from home . 
  where they are staying at and earning income from is considered their tax home .
