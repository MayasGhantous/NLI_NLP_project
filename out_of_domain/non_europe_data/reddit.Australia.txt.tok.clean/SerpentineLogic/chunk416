  they can take the [ home office deduction ] ( https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/income-and-deductions/deductions-you-can-claim/home-office-expenses/ ) .

  do you really need a necrobook when you are playing jakiro ? 
  why not spend the money on atos or other utility items ? 
   i have n't really changed what i eat that much , just the proportions, 
  as the saying goes , `` you can not out-exercise your fork '', 
  or tea . 
  your username is definitely untrue . 
  here 's some economics 101 reading for you .

  as far as trading goes , it should n't be a problem . 
  you can have multiple accounts on one login ( i think you only get one hin per account ? 
  not sure ) , and each one can have separate bank accounts or margin loan as the source of funds . 
  it probably leans on sharesight pretty hard for reporting something that complicated . 
  on the other hand , at least you have four people to spread the sharesight subscription between , because free tier wo n't cut it . 
  the libertarians i know are more about `` i want to pick and choose which parts of society i use/apply to me '' , but i can see how metasophie arrived at her opinion , because imo that 's what it ends up being most of the time . 
   professor quiggin studied 20 years of electricity privatisation reform , including the outcomes of power sales in victoria and south australia . 
   he found there are no benefits to consumers privatisation and has instead resulted in large financial losses to the public . 
   professor quiggin 's research shows electricity price rises were the highest in states with privatised power networks . 
   the report also found consumer complaints to the energy ombudsman in privatised states leapt from 500 to more 50,000 a year . 
   he says reforms have been a dismal failure and public ownership of power infrastructure is the best option . 
  is this meant to be a [ tom wolfe-style ] ( https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/tomwolfe390450.html ) insinuation ? 
  just because ayn rand rebelled against communism and went full objectivist does n't mean that everyone will . 
  if your opponent is making a fool of himself , * do not stop him * . 
  well , that 's one opinion , i guess . 
  australiansuper is consistently in the top 50 % of super fund rankings ( and sometimes * much * higher than 50 % ) . 
  choose a fund from that as a benchmark to compare against others you like , both well-regarded industry funds like rest and hostplus , and well-regarded commercial funds like amp . 
  after a phone contract , the next easiest way to demonstrate that you 're a good credit risk is having a credit card and paying it off every month . 
  it does n't have to be maxed out every month ( and i recommend not doing that ever ) . 
  australian here . 
  our desalinisation plants have been fucking expensive because they * need * to be run constantly , at least at a low output . 
  and the only reason we have them is that the other alternative ( waste water recycling ) was rejected in most cities :(, 
  the most cost-effective water saving measure has been local councils un-banning rainwater tanks so people can still water their gardens and fill swimming pools under water restriction . 
   top 500 australian companies pay $ 0 tax . 
  really ? 
  $ 0 tax ? 
  he 's exaggerating , but it is true that some of the largest companies that do business in australia pay fuck-all tax due to various legal tricks like [ double-irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) and and [ dutch sandwich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_sandwich ) . 
  other companies ( like ikea ) do that thing where ikea australia buys everything from ikea singapore , and the foreign ikea carefully adjusts its prices so it makes all the money and the australian company just breaks even . 
   ato being mean with centerlink debts ? 
  ato run centerlink do they ? 
  the ato does not run centrelink , but centrelink * did * ( legally ) get some tax data from the ato , fucked up the calculations , told the minister , he said `` do it anyway we 'll bring in lots of money '' , and a shitload of people got incorrect debt notices for $ 4000 or so . 
  so , his message is garbled but the underlying facts are vaguely correct . 
  corporate income tax is what op is talking about . 
  i mean , everyone pays gst and payroll tax and stuff like that because they 're hard to avoid ( economists like land taxes the most , because it 's really hard to avoid taxes by hiding a block of land ) . 
  income tax , on the other hand , is clearly an area that a lot of fudging happens , but it 's also where a large amount of tax money is at stake so it 's worth focusing on ( because the companies that do bend the rules are often the biggest , so there 's more tax dollars at stake ), 
  australian here . 
  what 's a blooming onion ? 
  is that some kind of american dish ? 
   i 'm australian , and not even sure if we have ranch dressing here, 
  we do n't even have fucking * ranches * . 
  cattle stations , yeah , sure , they 're the size of europe , but they 're not called ranches . 
  or more likely , they wo n't take cash because everyone uses contactless public transport cards . 
  the us is one of the first examples of a modern democracy ( france being earlier ofc ) and their constitution is really good . 
  but , other countries have added enhancements to the democratic process that the us so far has chosen not to do . 
  * consistent voting system across states ( each state does its own thing ), 
  * elections run by election experts ( each state does its own thing , and it 's under the control of state government , which is why you see all the republican districts get lots of voting centres and the democratic districts mysteriously get few ), 
  * inconsistent voting requirements ( proof of identity or whatever - note that australia does n't need that - we did the research and found it was n't worth doing , but it 's a great way to disenfranchise poor people who vote for the other party ), 
  * first past the post voting system , which game theory stipulates must end with only 2 real parties due to the spoiler effect, 
  * the stupid caucus system that should have been dumped in the 1800s, 
  * compulsory voting ( arguable , but in my opinion it 's a net upgrade over the us system ), 
  * voting on a tuesday and not mandating that people get time off work to vote, 
  * not having postal voting or early voting in all states, 
  * having to register with a party for the primaries , and again the rules are wildly different in each state, 
  * the electoral college is capped at 538 votes because `` that 's how many seats are in the chamber '' which distorts the lower house in favour of smaller states - smaller states already get bonuses from the senate , they should n't get bonuses in the lower house too, 
  * keeping money out of politics . 
  australia is bad at this , but the us is weapons-grade shithouse at it . 
  * keeping political advertising to a sane level . 
  new zealand is great at this , btw, 
  * partisanship everywhere . 
  too numerous to mention , but for example : sheriffs and district attorneys are apparently an elected position , so you literally have cops and lawyers running political campaigns . 
  anyway , that 's just a few things off the top of my head . 
  but , do you support capping the electoral college numbers at 538 , in direct contravention of the wishes of the us founders ? 
   and if the system was skewed against the democrats , would obama not have attempted to fix the system during his time in power ? 
  well , the first point ( states rights etc etc ) means that he ca n't interfere with individual states , should they choose to do shady things . 
  and in one case , that state is pretty-much fucked . 
  north carolina is in the unenviable position of having actually lost democracy . 
   in 2010 the republicans won a majority of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since 1898 . 
  whereas previous congressional redistricting plans for the state had favored democrats , the newest plan is expected to favor republicans . 
  in 2012 the state also elected its first republican governor and lieutenant governor , pat mccrory and dan forest , in more than two decades while also giving the republicans veto-proof majorities in both the state house of representatives and state senate . 
  several u.s. house of representatives seats also flipped control , with the republicans currently controlling ten seats to the democrats ' three . 
  republican lawmakers pushed through a state law that removes the ability for courts to force election districts to be fairer . 
  the can tell the governor `` stop gerrymandering , we reject this redistricting plan '' but they ca n't force him to make the next one better , so he can just resubmit an equally-bad plan that will keep him elected . 
   in 2016 , federal courts struck down many of voting restrictions and gerrymandered districts instituted by republicans , saying they harmed racial minorities . 
  after the 2016 election , andrew reynolds , a political science professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , drew media attention when he noted that north carolina 's election integrity score , as measured by the electoral integrity project , was similar to cuba , indonesia and sierra leone . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] an editorial in the wall street journal , however , ridiculed him , saying that the higher scores given to autocracies like rwanda and cuba only discredited the study . 
  [ 11 ] slate further remarked that the election integrity score of the united states '' ( 62 ) is below that of rwanda , a full-on autocracy '' [ 12 ], 
  but there 's still serious concerns for fairness . 
  i guess my position can be summed up as :, 
  * the us has a great democratic process in historical terms, 
  * it has an * okay * process in modern terms, 
  * the us has become complacent about fair elections , and standards * are * slipping . 
  not as many as we used to , but yeah . 
  new zealand still has lots , because their clmate supports higher density since it actually rains over there . 
   adding even more vim to the game ? 
  reply `` no blue intel '', 
  super early days maybe .
