  how close are your parents to paying off the loan ? 
  i mean , if you take it out and they have < $ 100k left , that 's manageable , but it 's another thing entirely if they still have a large sum left , because you 're saving them a lot of compounding interest repayments . 
  unless you see an immediate need to spend it , it 's not a bad idea to help your parents out with the money for a while . 
  however , i 'd be a bit reluctant to * keep * putting money in , because it means the shock is worse when you do eventually pull the money out .

   i had most of it invested in vas/vgs but withdrew it when the market peaked because i was not happy with vgs . 
  and, 
   i wanted to put new funds in vts/veu anyway for exposure to small cap/emerging markets and for the lower fees, 
  it 's clear your goal is to have a decent amount of international exposure , but you 're currently underweight at the moment . 
  in that case , why not trickle your funds back into vgs over the next 12 months or so , to realise your timing-related gains , while hedging your bets about whether the market will rise or fall ? 
  ( bearing in mind that nobody knows what 's going on in the us , if the us market dips , buying vgs cements the cheaper overall price ),

  to be a good lawyer , you need,

  my opinion is that you should build up a diversified base before branching out into individual stocks . 
  losing a big chunk money because you bought billabong or woolworths is bad . 
  losing that much on your first investment is doubly bad , because it tends to make your entire investment approach more conservative , at a point where you are least confident , and have the least to actually lose . 
  hence why i suggest you spread the risk with a fund . 
  a 50/50 vas/vgs split is a solid foundation , and yeah , as you said you can add more stuff to your portfolio but still keep vas and vgs as the backbone .

   but i do n't understand how that super contribution amount is calculated as it is not 10 % of $ 50k ( as is the case with the first example ) . 
  ok , let 's break it down . 
  in the first , easy example :, 
  * your pay : $ 50k ( i.e. 
  * plus super : $ 5k ( i.e. 
  +10 % of base salary ), 
  * total gain to you : 110 % of base salary ( although the 10 % is locked away in super ) = $ 55k all up, 
  second example is just the same thing , except since you get both amounts totalled up , you work backwards . 
  * total gain : $ 50k ( i.e. 
  the entire 110 % is just given to you to deal with ), 
  * your pay : 100/110 of $ 50k = $ 45 455, 
  * plus super : 10/110 of $ 50k = $ 4 545, 
  in reality , that `` 10 % '' is probably going to be 9.5 % since that 's the minimum super rate , but it 's not difficult to adjust the numbers to match that . 
  keep it in fixed interest until you get income .

   currently i have ~ $ 30k in my emergency fund which is about 6 months income .
