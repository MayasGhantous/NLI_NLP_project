   my inner tech startup fanboy is trending towards just buying a bunch of google/apple/microsoft shares . 
  but my gut says this is n't the smartest way to invest . 
  buying directly is , imo , a pain in the arse . 
  if you select an index fund , you get exposure to many tech companies without worrying about whether the 2 you chose are actually the winners . 
  ticker name sector weight ( % ) notional value, 
  aapl apple inc information technology 16.24 %, 
  msft microsoft corp information technology 12.38 %, 
  fb facebook class a inc information technology 7.55 %, 
  googl alphabet inc class a information technology 6.22 %, 
  goog alphabet inc class c information technology 6.06 %, 
  intc intel corporation corp information technology 4.44 %, 
  csco cisco systems inc information technology 3.83 %, 
  ibm international business machines co information technology 3.74 %, 
  orcl oracle corp information technology 3.03 %, 
  qcom qualcomm inc information technology 2.36 %, 
  good diversity for a single purchase . 
  ofc , you could diversify further , in case tech stocks get wrecked by executive orders or whatever . 
  selecting the nasdaq-100 scoops up all the big tech stocks , plus a bunch of other large-cap stocks o provide a bit more diversification . 
  so , congratulations on thinking ahead , i tihnk you 'll have a lot of fun working out the pros and cons . 
  many people lose early , and stop playing . 
  i think there 's a mobile app that counts down for you and tells you what to do next , if you prefer .

  it 's not personal ; just business . 
  imo the important thing is to learn enough about the game to do backseat commentary about how terrible all his teammates are . 
  anything else is gravy . 
  its more effort though , since vgs balances between the two for you . 
  there are companies making drones in australia . 
  might pick up some work if you have clearance . 
  you need to pull the second camp when the first camp has ~ 1.5 creeps worth of health left . 
  that means that the last jungle creep dies about the same time as the second camp gets in aggro range of your lane creeps . 
  or maybe just disable the edge * below the backpack * when panning with an item ? 
  even as a support , there are things you can do to assist your team to push . 
  putting a ward behind the tower you want pushed makes your teammates confident they can react to rotations , which is often the difference between a tower kill and backing off so it gets denied 30 seconds later . 
  even forced movement works - like drow gust . 
  to be fair , 90 % of the time , we kinda * did * . 
  that 's when russia sends escorts to sex you up . 
  here 's a map of [ common ward spots ] ( http://devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap3/?x=589&amp;y=-641&amp;shrines=true&amp;shops=true&amp;runes=true&amp;bountyrunes=true&amp;towers=true&amp;observer=1808,-2870;-2886,724;-5876,3376;-3442,4475;974,4632;-1217,2713;-469,410;5068,-776;5468,-3254;3686,-5138;-1061,-4588;-4355,-1274;5138,785&amp;zoom=0 ) . 
  some wards cover the mid rune spots as well as jungle entrances , some are just jungle entrances top stop ganks , some are lane wards that are used to spot rotations ( mostly for when your support leaves the lane but the carry still wants to farm there - they 're the ones that cover the lane + river ), 
  there 's also high-ground spots near t1 and t2 towers that you can place when you 're trying to take their tower . 
  not all towers have one - each side 's safelane t1 does n't have a good spot nearby , so you usually just place one behind the t1 ( hold alt to ensure you are n't placing the ward where the tower can see ), 
  that 's not all the good ward spots , but wherever you go , there 's likely to be a good spot to place a ward - it 's especially useful to carry a ward when you go into their side of the map together , so you get aggressive vision . 
  when you 're on the defensive , that 's when most of your wards go in your half of the map . 
  try persicaria odorata ( the plant that you get in pho ) . 
  also called vietnamese coriander and laksa leaf . 
  tbh it does n't really taste like mint . 
  i do n't think it 's as straightforward as that . 
  you need vision for blink , which parties help with . 
  sb works better if you 're going hunting without vision . 
  if it 's a small business , why not just set up a separate petty cash bank account , and talk with your bank to set up a few debit cards for it ? 
  then you 'd get xero integration like any other bank account , and you should be able to tell which card is responsible for each transaction . 
  it 's nice that you picked up 40 points , but what 's the comparison rate ? 
  are there break fees ? 
  do you lose the ability to redraw that 200k ? 
  do you lose the ability to pay extra while fixed ? 
  ( this happens often ), 
  fyi dotabuff is good to view the meta , and hero stats etc , but for personal performance , [ opendota ] ( https://www.opendota.com/matches/2937137610 ) is better .

  it 's not even an australian meme . 
  only americans make that joke . 
  the unemployment department linked data with the tax department to catch welfare payment overpayments . 
  except they used aggregate whole year tax data so people who found a job halfway through the year looked like they were cheating on benefits . 
  the government minister was briefed but said `` run it any way , the projected revenue is already accounted for on our budget '' and now thousands of people are getting debt notices incorrectly ( over 80 % of notices sent out are wrong , always in their favour ), 
  people are understandably upset .

  well , the government provides a hefty rebate for child care , so chances are there are zero daycare centres that do n't receive any government funding . 
   the rebate helps families cover the out-of-pocket costs of child care and it is ** not income tested ** . 
  even if your family income is too high for you to receive the child care benefit , you may be eligible for the child care rebate . 
  it covers up to ** 50 per cent ** of out-of-pocket costs , up to $ 7,500 per child , per year . 
  i guess the idea is that without affordable childcare , people ca n't work , so ultimately the country is less productive . 
  what about religious exemptions ? 
  ah , removed in 2015, 
  please note that op linked to a vaccination skeptic web site . 
  * this * article is unbiased , but other pages on the site are much less likely to be . 
  you should refuse . 
  you ca n't even give whooping cough shots to your kid until they 're three months old , and they do n't fully activate until they have had the six month shot . 
  point for her being honest with you instead of sneaky shit , but if your baby gets measles or mumps , it 's not her who will be buying the tiny coffin .

  it 's okay . 
  i asked because the owner of the linked web site went on radio a few years ago asking doubters to register religious exemptions for some bullshit reason . 
  actually , yeah . 
  he was a dick to his underlings but he started a bunch of committees that came back with good policies . 
  gonski and his education reforms , the mining tax which was objectively exactly the same as the one we already have on bass strait oil , um what else , solar rebate , green investment fund , nbn , shit i never realized we had it so good .

  idk , seems like radiance implies being around people for a long time to be worth it . 
  i 'm not sure whether ember 's play style is really suited to that - he seems a lot more geared around bursty hit-and-run attacks . 
  also , flame guard kinda does the same thing as radiance so i 'm not sure whether it 's as valuable for farming , considering you * ca n't * skip maelstrom . 
  i 've mentored a few grads in my time .
