  an advisor will tell you that they will need more capital stable and income producing investments compared to growth assets at their age . 
  so , i 'd see what options are available inside and outside super , and what ratio is needed to keep their standard of living up . 
  also , it would be good to tell your advisor what kind of budget expectations your parents have . 
  it would help calculating things . 
  why not buy into commercial property instead ? 
  less bubbly , same rental income stream . 
  also there are etfs and lics for commercial property so they can buy diversification instead of going all in into a single property . 
  if it were me , i 'd actually look at the asset mixes inside some popular super funds to see what kind of ratios are common . 
  many funds have some kind of `` life stages '' product that alters the mix depending on your age , so you might be able to get really targeted asset mixes out of them . 
  that way you come to the table more informed , so when your advisor starts saying `` put 20 % into tech stocks '' you can say `` okay back the fuck up mate '', 
  they can still negatively gear with shares instead of property . 
  it 's more about the fact that buying a house and renting it is generally poor income returns , so a million dollar house vs million dollars in < anything else  will probably result in pissing away hundreds of dollars a week in potential income ( a 1 % difference in income on a million bucks is ~ $ 200/week ), 
  30 % leverage is not the problem . 
  it 's buying underperforming assets with the money that is the problem . 
  investment rental properties are just not good yield right now . 
  it 's important to understand what their money situation will be like after they retire , so they can make changes sooner rather than later .

   im a 20 year old uni student working part time .

  what 's your cost of living ? 
  i would hesitate to lock any money away until you have 3-6 months of expenses available to you . 
  ( a high interest savings account is fine to stash the money in , since you can get it out without selling stuff ), 
   im wondering whether to open an index fund or rather contribute to my superannuation account . 
  it greatly depends on what you plan to spend the money on . 
  if you plan to * spend * the majority of your money on stuff before you retire ( like a house , car , kids etc ) then i think that 's probably the same ratio you should you for outside-vs-inside super . 
  having said that , there 's a few things that mean you might put a bit into super even at your age , like https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in-detail/growing/low-income-super-contribution/, 
   but does the superannuation system work in a similar way to index funds ? 
  as in does your money compound ? 
  that 's correct . 
  however , funds and super have different fees . 
  * funds and super both have management fees ( e.g `` 0.3 % of your total per year '', 
  * funds will hit you with brokerage fees whenever you put money into them, 
  * super will ( probably ) charge you a monthly/yearly fee - this could be a few hundred bucks a year . 
  having said that , super has better tax rules than normal investments , but at low tax brackets that 's not super important i guess .
