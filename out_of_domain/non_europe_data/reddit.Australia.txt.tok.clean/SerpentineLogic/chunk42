  * 134 rep ( 188 hardener + rep heated , 225 w / exile for ohshit moments , nears 500 w / legion in system ) - more if you pimp the repper, 
  * 573 ( 644 ) dps w / implants ( +5 % / +3 % , consider these standard for this sort of work ) and overheat ( t3 cruiser so always heating basically ), 
  * can drop mar for eanm and faction/deadspace fit the tank to reach 100k ehp, 
  * can probably use an ancillary current router + drop to small repper to fit neutrons, 
  * [ tested ] ( http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12993492 ) in combat,

  `` cruisers '' should probably be `` marauders '' in the attributes . 
  shits and giggles : always the best reason to start a corp. 
  why so hostile ? 
  it 's just a typo . 
  they 'll fix it in the next sisi drop . 
   good changes except for mechanical engineering being in one faction only, 
  the faction that 's currently winning , and thus can produce datacores for cheap ? 
  redbacks are n't too bad . 
  the poison is slow-acting and you have heaps of time * to drive yourself to the hospital to get the antivenom . 
  \\* about 5 hours . 
  if only you could get video games over the internet . 
  ( actual size ), 
  ( seriously ), 
  because it was originally advertised as a battleship-only module ( like the microjumpdrive ) and cruisers are n't battleships . 
  nice try , hydra alt . 
  not any better than an ishtar . 
  mise well fly talos then . 
  nags are pretty decent for hot-dropping , but are fairly fragile .

  or maybe you should just fit a heavy capacitor booster and avoid the problem entirely . 
  i think it would have more crisp detail if you 'd chosen resin as the material . 
  i did this . 
  get a buddy trial from the link in the sidebar ( or message me lol ), 
  activate account with a subscription ( or game time card ) , receive hundreds of millions of isk from your buddy in return, 
  1 . immediately remap max intelligence , and since you 're a new player and will likely need ship and combat skills , put the rest in perception . 
  train cybernetics iv , plug in +4 implants you bought with your new isk, 
  train to v ( in no particular order ) [ basic ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/basic_skills.php ) support skills, 
  engineering, 
  electronics, 
  energy management, 
  energy systems operation, 
  that will take you a month or so . 
  after that , you 'll likely need to pick up the prerequisites for afterburners and microwarpdrives , as well as shield or armor tanking skills , which should bump you up to two months or so . 
  in which way am i incorrect ? 
  thanks . 
  test alliance has a [ basic 30 day plan ] ( http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/basic_30_day_plan ) that you might like to peruse . 
  it really is generic and designed for players who have no idea at all what to train , but you can base * your * advice to your friends on it . 
  you can remap as soon as you want , but you only get two remaps initially ( when you use the first remap , it starts a twelve-month respawn timer , but only the first remap ever respawns ) . 
  most people who start an alt ( and who do n't intend to actually , you know , * play it * for months , will remap int/mem and train support skills for 6 months , then remap per/will and train combat skills from then on . 
  new players generally benefit from int/per at the start , because no matter how disciplined they are about training support skills , they will still need a mix of support and combat skills to actually enjoy themselves . 
  ( this is also the best remap combination for navigation skills ), 
  generally after 6-9 months , the player 's support skills are good enough that they can remap to per/will and train weapons and spaceship command . 
  as far as account activation goes , any unused days of your free trial are added to the start of your subscription , so if you activate the day you receive the buddy-program trial , you 'll have a minimum of 21 +30 days playing time . 
  going 145 days training only support skills would be a bit rough for a starting character , though . 
  that 's where i saw it first vov, 
  well , named mwds and afterburners * used to be * quite rare so t2 was a lot cheaper even if the fitting was higher , much like meta-4 target painters vs t2 . 
  then the loot drop tables got borked . 
  so , start a mining corp , then once it gets big enough , join an alliance and build for them . 
  easy . 
  you should thank him for giving you a motivation to track him down and pod him . 
  he 's providing you valuable game content ~, 
  i took the book for the amusing lossmail . 
  everyone needs electronics v. . . 
  interestingly enough , a common treatment program is basically to give blood every 2 weeks until the iron levels settle down . 
  except you ca n't really use the blood because of the high iron content . 
  apparently giving someone a transfusion already makes their iron ( ferritin ? ), 
  levels rise , so if you give them blood that 's already loaded with iron , you ca n't give them any more transfusions without endangering them . 
  looks like ceve did something right , putting on 40k subscriptions in the last few months .

  wow has a chart with a [ different scale ] ( http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/charts/subs-1.png ) . 
  plz dont hunt me, 
  why submit to them at all ? 
  for your own corp and poach members from them . 
  another bonus - no technetium required to make tech 2 plates . 
  they ca n't have . 
  they 're still subbed . 
  not even then . 
  looks like it will be after inferno is first released . 
  apparently they 're [ famed for it ] ( http://nosygamer.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/eve-onlines-tranquility-subscription.html ) . 
  i suppose when the numbers have always been good , why hide them ? 
  i find euro gamer usually covers the major events in an unbiased fashion . 
  mintchip videos are one place where nobody can say they 're inb4chribba ... 
  i started taking him seriously as an actor after * chopper * . 
  it 's very generic and do n't feel bad changing stuff around , but it 's a start . 
  i believe test alliance has a similar plan . 
  that is a good thing . 
  aha , found it . 
  the test plan has better explanations for its choices .
