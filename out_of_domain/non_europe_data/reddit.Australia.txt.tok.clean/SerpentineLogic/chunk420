  asians have the [ best mid game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ocrkk.jpg ) . 
  i mean , if you take it late , everyone is trash . 
  i love that candle [ . 
  ] ( https://candlesbyasaakira.com/products/yellow-fever-by-asa-akira ), 
  service stations , too . 
  night shift is especially good , since you can bring a textbook during slack periods . 
  no re, 
   you are n't smart enough to get away with not studying . 
  you will probably manage well enough for one or two years , but then you 'll be fucked in third year . 
  source : was fucked in third year . 
  but it 's thermal coal , which nobody wants because coal power stations are not cost efficient , or good for the environment . 
  that 's fine , but there 's already a bunch of mines servicing those power plants , and as china winds up its coal power stations , the coal that it produces will also go on the market , further depressing the price . 
  india also has pretty big coal reserves if push comes to shove . 
  dude if you ca n't throne by 50 then you 're just fucking about . 
  commended, 
  maybe a 5k playing sloppily then, 
  given the topic , why not an aussie kiss ? 
  being nearby when history is being made is generally not a pleasant experience . 
  they also ran a successful australian bank . 
  [ this is fine ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/919fb260254e4bd2a65fc826e062dc46?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=5474c84104eeecef54d117e701865722 ), 
  drums is not a good item for jugg . 
  dominator gives you better stats , +20 attack speed , a lot of health regen ( more than battlefury ) , and a neat active . 
  the active allows you to pick up, 
  * pink satyr for +6 health regen, 
  * kobold foreman for +15 % move speed, 
  * alpha wolf for +30 % base attack damage, 
  * hellbear for +15 attack speed, 
  * hill troll priest for +3 mana regen, 
  none of which require you to do anything except select the creep and m-click your hero so they follow you around . 
  probably where you 'd slot in drums . 
  often , i just buy a stick and / or raindrops instead of full wand , unless there 's spell spammers in my lane . 
  remember you can pick up components in between . 
  like , if you run out of regen , it might be time to pick up a ror for a headdress . 
  vancouver also [ passed a law ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/vancouver-wields-c-10-000-a-day-fine-in-crackdown-on-empty-homes ) that fines property owners if they leave their house or flat empty for more than 12 months, 
  part of the flow-on effects of lots of foreign housing investment is that they buy a house just to have the asset , and consider it less hassle to leave it empty than to deal with renters . 
  this squeezes supply of rental properties , which means rent rises at the same time housing prices rise , which means normal canadians are screwed either way . 
  edit : they 're not mucking about either . 
  * cad10 ,000 / year in extra rates if it 's vacant for more than 6 months per year . 
  * lie about it being vacant ? 
  fines of up to cad10 ,000 ** per day ** until you find a tenant . 
  opendota has [ better analysis ] ( https://www.opendota.com/matches/2967537901 ) of a single game , imo . 
  denies @ 10 is an easy thing to work on . 
  when you place the ward on the highground near bot rune , place it in the bottom right corner of the ward spot , so it has vision of the rune . 
  i suggest you try out putting a ward behind the t1 tower you plan to push next , especially the first t1 you try to take . 
  siege has way more health though , so it gives more mana . 
  well the asx 50 , 200 etc all have index funds that track them , so that 's an option for diversified blue chips . 
  obviously higher risk and reward than a savings account . 
  the problem is choosing well over your entire investment career . 
  which is a reasonable government policy to enact . 
  it 's a lot easier to snowball your wealth if you are rich enough , and after a few generations of snowballing you get some real - french - saudi royalty kind of shit . 
  best support and least restrictive plans : sky mesh . 
  best raw value : my republic . 
  well , you 'd run out seals way before you ran out of americans . 
  the main draw of index funds is that they are really easy to administer . 
  this means the fees are low , which makes a bigger difference over the long term than someone spending a lot of time ( and salary cost ) trying to beat the index . 
   i went with tpg because they had the cheapest month-to-month unlimited 100/40 plan . 
  ] ( https://myrepublic.net/au/personal/nbn/pricing/ ), 
  at my kid 's school , peanuts were banned in prep but are allowed in later years . 
  there 's a blanket ban on sharing food though , and the kids are old enough to know which of their classmates are allergic , so it 's less of a problem . 
   no religion on the planet says you ca n't get vaccinated, 
  only [ one aussie religion ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/vaccinationexempt-church-revealed-as-christian-scientists-20150414-1mkmj8.html ) applied for exemption , which was rescinded recently so now there are no churches that are exempt . 
  well , it 's definitely a thing for childcare centres . 
  kids that are already in school are another thing entirely . 
  no , really ? 
  yeah , i 'd much rather have malcolm than donald in charge . 
  although , i 'd rather have gore or sanders than turnbull . 
  depends on the bank . 
  some banks run batches 7 days a week . 
  that 's because laffer had one good idea and has n't made a good economic decision since then . 
  his wikipedia page is basically a series of fuck ups . 
  of course , the main sticking point in any discussion about the curve is exactly * where we are * on it . 
  laffer appears to be under the impression the usa taxes too much for optimal revenue , but the majority of economists disagree . 
  in fact , one economist thinks that you 'd need a top tax bracket of about 70 % . 
  well it 's a lot harder when people like / u/pixelwhip 's partner go out of business because nobody buys their stuff ... 
  good state schools are hard to get into , but cheaper than paying for a private school . 
  these are people who * are * in ( or are willing to buy into ) the correct catchment area for the school , but there 's a waiting list so their kids are not guaranteed a spot , so they wait in line so their kids are further up the list . 
  and sometimes it 's still cheaper than paying for private schools . 
  i mean , i would be shocked if you could get a private school education for less than $ 150k per child . 
  dropping an extra $ 200k on a house in the right catchment already makes sense . 
  / r/theredcarpet, 
  under almost all circumstances , no . 
  well , signing up to commsec will give you 2 free trades , so splitting up into 2 funds is free . 
  after the free period , trades are $ 19.95 , so in 2 year 's time , you will have paid almost $ 80 ( two trades per year ) . 
  if you 'd gone with cmc markets , then you 'd be out of pocket $ 22 for the initial trades , but after 2 years you 'd have only paid $ 66 in brokerage all told . 
  idk i thin free brokerage is only really an issue if you rock up with $ 100k to dump into the market in free period . 
  otherwise , it 's better to go for cheaper trades . 
  jesus christ on a crutch . 
  i have never used nabtrade . 
  from what i hear , it has no compelling reasons to choose it over anything else unless you 're already with nab . 
  `` this fucken heat ay . 
  checks out . 
  note that it 's based on the visible mmr of players you play with or against , so it can be quite unreliable at lower levels , where fewer people show mmr on their profile . 
  you only level the passive first if you plan to get into a harassment match against melee carries because you trade really well . 
  solo against a silencer as well as wk stun , i think that was not a good plan . 
  i 'm not sure torte ogre is a particularly good guide anyway . 
  just personal preference - i like soul ring rush with stout and mango , and i max w rather than e. 
  gel pillows are too small . 
  there are gel mats you can put on top of your mattress that are at least big enough to dissipate heat . 
  just as planned , then . 
  hey , you 're seeking different opinions about stuff you 're not sure of - that 's a great attitude to have .
