  i found the whirlpool finance threads to be pretty decent , but just occasionally you 'll get someone submit something obviously scammy , and a few suspiciously-similar-sounding other people chime in saying how great an investment x is and how everyone should do it too . 
  but apparently still worth it . 
  it 's an unusual fetish , but you do you , man . 
  progressives : `` things could be better !, 
  let 's try new things !, 
  i 'm impetuous ! '', 
  conservatives : `` things could be a lot worse !, 
  can we try things very slowly ? 
  i 'm worried ! '', 
  reactionaries : `` things are not as good any more !, 
  let 's go back to how things used to be !, 
  i 'm nostalgic ! '', 
  also how hard is it to select a creep and m click on your hero so it follows ? 
  hell , just send it to scout roshan if it 's too much . 
  i have seen a number of 1 4 4 builds . 
  if your mortgage is not tax deductible , then you 're saving a lot more in interest by paying it off than you 'd get by investing it . 
  plus you do n't pay tax on `` interest you saved '' , so it 's probably 42 % more than the lending rate . 
  is ig handled via chess though ? 
  edit : [ looks like no ] ( https://www.ig.com/au/glossary-trading-terms/custodian-definition ) . 
   under share trading with ig , shares purchased are ** held by citi ** in a direct custody capacity . 
  australian shares purchased through ig are registered in chess under citicorp nominees pty limited , with a chess participant identification number ( pid ) 20018 . 
  they are held on the client 's behalf ** by citibank pty ltd ** . 
  uk and us shares are held by citibank n.a. 
  german shares are held by citigroup global markets . 
  the clients are the ultimate beneficial owners . 
  ... that turn into money, 
  plumbers should be called crackies . 
  no , they 're slappies . 
  also opens up other items like orchid . 
  it 's really good in ability draft . 
  this is not as implausible as it appears . 
  since the start of this year , i have upped my loan repayments to be exactly 50 % of our after-tax income . 
  i guess i 'll see how long i can manage it for . 
  the stories i could tell ... 
  parents are helping out with school costs . 
  i guess we 'll see how it goes . 
  if push comes to shove , my wife could go back to work i guess . 
  i do n't think * driver * less bikes will be a thing - you need the human to lean into turns , so it makes a lot more sense to let the human steer as well . 
  i suppose you could do a rider-less bike , for courier work etc , or a trike so it 's stable enough for taxiing people around . 
  it would n't be fun for the passenger tho . 
  the crest on their head can poke holes in a car body . 
  then it 's functionally a trike , since the passenger does n't need to lean into curves . 
  do n't forget tranquil plus soul ring for huge mana sustainability . 
  does mk do well vs blademail ? 
  prioritise how ? 
  like , do you buy a bed first , or a fridge , or what ? 
  that kind of thing ? 
  sorry , those stories are ` in-person ' only . 
  as a couple , you 're paying interest on the same number of houses ( 2 ), 
  the loan on ip # 1 has a tax-deduction of x1 , where x1 is the marginal tax rate of person 1 . 
  the loan on ip # 2 has a tax-deduction of ( x1 + x2 ) / 2 . 
  mathematically , if x2 < x1 , then the couple , together , can claim less tax back on ip # 2 , and thus should pay that one off first . 
  see if you can find a book called ` family village tribe ' . 
  it was written by an ex-flightie ( for a while , they gave a copy to all new hires ) . 
  when you read of the kinds of shenanigans that appear * in an authorised corporate biography * , you 'll get an inkling of the kinds of things that were left out . 
  could always get hired by flight centre ... [ no shortage of beer ] ( https://preprod.instagram.com/p/bnvvhg_ho72/ ) there . 
  wr and sb have active abilities though . 
  pl 's illusions also get rush , so there 'd be stickies everywhere . 
  it gives a good `` caster vs rightclick '' choice at level 10 but leaves him without a defensive talent until 15 . 
   without nerfs, 
   * agility gain from 1.5 to 1.0, 
   * howl manacost from 30 to 40, 
  oh , mjolnir active * and * proc , forgot about that . 
  i guess pl goes boots -  aquila -  raindrops -  farming aghs now ? 
  plus it 's good to have a teamfight-oriented ult . 
  source : 63.64 % win rate with lich over 121 matches . 
  the important thing is to be in a suburb where you do n't have to change trains to get to coorparoo . 
  seems like it might be a thing for lc . 
  also breaks linkens , so there 's that . 
  an investment portfolio needs a mixture of income vs growth assets . 
  income produces mostly cash , while growth produces mostly capital gains . 
  the classic ` balanced ' portfolio is 50/50 income vs growth , with conservative 70/30 and aggressive 30/70 being vaguely-reasonable yardsticks towards the edges . 
  an example income-producing asset is vaf ( fixed interest and capital-stable ) , although vhy might be a better option due to franking credits etc , at the risk of stock market fluctuations instead . 
  an example growth asset is vgs , which is n't really big on the dividends compared to raw stock price rise . 
  vas is the australian version , although there 's probably an overlap between vas and vhy . 
  there are many alternatives in separate markets etc. 
  you might like to start out with one growth asset and one income option at a ratio of your choosing , and see how that goes after 6 or 12 months . 
  the income-producing asset gives you money to invest with , while the growth asset will fluctuate up or down but overall , will probably provide better returns in the long run ( especially if you keep adding to it regularly , so you get good value from your income asset if your growth asset is in a slump because you buy more shares per dollar ), 
  personally , i like sharesight for tracking my portfolio , but i 'm a bit biased since my broker ( cmc ) will set up a sharesight login for new clients and keep it synced up with trades i make . 
  [ the dark is rising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_dark_is_rising_sequence ) series ( first published 1965 , last book 1977 ), 
  vanguard is a company that lists etfs on the stock market , and also operates managed funds that buy into the etfs . 
  you can buy in from any share broker . 
  there are other etf suppliers like black rock i shares etc. 
  they often do slightly different indexes so as not to compete head to head all the time . 
  vas is a good fund , it tracks the index well and the index itself has grown at a fair clip . 
  most of the complaints about vas are really about the index itself and the companies in it , being bank heavy etc , but hey , if you want `` australian shares '' it 's basically the default choice . 
  i try to keep small cap and exploration shares to a strict < 10 % part of my portfolio , personally . 
  i have lost too much money on them over the years , although your circumstances are not the same . 
  fair enough . 
  just make sure you diversify . 
  that 's why a lot of people like index funds , since it diversifies across the entire index . 
  i think it 'll be a lot easier to sit back and pick up the pieces . 
  this explains the one sad guy in each boy band . 
  if you 're 6 slotted the do whatever you want , but you need to explain the reasoning behind why you 'd * want * fast boots of travel on lich . 
  the main benefit of fast travels is split pushing by porting to a creep wave . 
  lich does not push fast , and has no escape if someone rotates . 
  also you just spent 2000 gold on an item with no utility between cool downs , so they are likely to have gear that 's way more useful to them in a stand up fight . 
  anything can work ^ tm but it 's a lot of gold spent when you could achieve the same thing with just being off the map supporting one carry while the other 3 players push . 
  its a very reactive strategy and some strategic thinking ( pre warding , setting up a trap using smoke etc ) can avoid the entire problem . 
  also , it 's risky to think a single lich rotation is enough to fend off a gank , as you mentioned when enemies turn around and kill you both .
