  maybe other heroes might be better for that . 
  i like aghs , mostly because it 's * easy mode * . 
  it gives okay boosts to health and mana , which you really need , it makes your ult slow more , makes it unlimited bounces ( only really applicable in super-long teamfights when they 're pushing your t3 , or roshing or you need the bounces ( illusions mostly ) . 
  more importantly , it boosts the damage by 30 % / 25 % / 20 % so it 's a fairly effective replacement for veil . 
  you can , ofc , use both . 
  that 's certainly an option , but imo not mandatory . 
  it 's good as part of a - armour or + armour strat , but since lich does almost zero physical damage , generally you 'd get it on other heroes instead ( like venge ), 
  true . 
  i expect solar crest on the pos 3 or 4 rather than the pos 5 though . 
  idk . 
  i have something like 700 games all told . 
  my most-used heroes are lc , lich and pl in that order . 
  the rop is to reduce the need to courier it out , since the rest of tranquils can be bought at the side shop . 
  probably more important for offlane lich than safelane , since my carry * will * get something sent out sooner or later . 
  i do n't usually buy sentries until i suspect that the enemy team has actually placed a ward near me . 
  i know it 's bad , but in my experience , i place approximately twice as many wards as the enemy does , so unless i have a clue that the enemy has vision ( based on how they move ) or it 's a really obvious ward spot , my sentries will just be wasted gold . 
  i really like the idea of a clarity at the start . 
  i probably do n't use as many consumables as i should . 
  i ward where i want my team to go . 
  here 's purge starting with a ring of protection on lich . 
  law graduate . 
  i have a 1 hour commute , and it 's shit . 
  the only thing it has going for it is most of it is on a train so i can use my phone without vomiting like i would on a bus . 
  brisbane . 
  let 's round up and you have a 53 % win rate . 
  in one hundred games , you win 53 and lose 47 , so you go up 150mmr . 
  if you want to gain mmr twice as fast , either get your win percentage up to 56 % or play twice as many games per day . 
  after the nerfs , it 's more comparable with vanguard , so there 's that . 
  is there a magical mmr level where you think you will start having fun playing dota ? 
  because you just wrote that you would n't enjoy playing dota between your current mmr and that target number , otherwise you would n't be complaining . 
  not really . 
  i mean , if you were a 2k level player you would have much higher win rate . 
  you might want to buy the next ti compendium if it has season ranked play , since it lets you recalibrate and keep the highest rating at the end of the season . 
  in that case , it will be based on your unranked performance so you still need to be actually good to gain mmr , it just lets you skip a few steps . 
  amendments do n't count, 
  just the most recent one .

  it 's a bit lower yield , but so is losing $ 22 every few months . 
  once a year is fine . 
  the 50/50 vas/vgs split should do you for a fair while . 
  you can quibble over percentages and diversification into more niche markets but it 's a solid core . 
   at the time of this writing , the installed cost of solar panels was between $ 7 - $ 9 per watt : a 5 kw system would cost around $ 25,000 - $ 35,000 . 
  yeah it 's a * bit * cheaper now . 
  try [ $ 8000 ] ( http://www.positronicsolar.com/specials.html ) ( in aud , so about usd6200 ) . 
  if that was cost-effective in your country , would n't houses already do that ? 
  in australia , most of us already have solar hot water systems , although they 're being phased out , since it 's now cheaper to put up more solar and have an electric heat pump instead . 
  i would say that the high capital costs of installation are way more important than the 10-25 % lower effectiveness in summer that op mentioned , then , especially with the low price of electricity in the us . 
  it 's about 2.5 x the cost down under .

  after your employer switches , you can roll over the super a few ways , but the easiest is by using mygov . 
  maybe it 's time to go through items then . 
  whatever i can until the cap . 
  at the moment , high interest savings accounts look like a better deal . 
  bonds are better if you have a few * million * you need to sink into capital-stable investments , but aussie bank accounts are guaranteed up to 250k so that 's good enough for most people .
