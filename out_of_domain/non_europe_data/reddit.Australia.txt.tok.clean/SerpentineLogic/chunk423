  think of it this way . 
  say your savings account is 3 % interest and shares are 6 % interest . 
  the difference is 0.25 % / month , so money you invest should ( on average ) pay for a 0.4 % transaction cost after a few months . 
  whereas , if you made a $ 1000 transaction , that 's a 2 % hit and it would take most of a year just to break even on that . 
  part of rebalancing is taking profits when things get out of hand . 
  ( what 's ` out of hand ? ', 
  vanguard has a [ long paper ] ( https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/icrpr.pdf ) about it ) . 
  if you 're in the accumulation phase of your portfolio , then you can avoid that by shoring up the lowest-performing part instead of transferring * from * the best-performing asset . 
  after a point , that stops working as the amounts get big enough that brokerage stops being an issue , or when the swings get big enough that you 're forced to take profit . 
  they 're doing it gracefully . 
  a coup de grace , if you will .

    what is your risk tolerance ?

  well , that does n't mesh with your portfolio , which is $ 250k in cash and $ 200k in relatively-low growth , high-yield stocks .

  awesome voting system . 
  of course , we also have compulsory voting but that 's probably not an option for you guys because of your different take on personal freedom compared to the commonwealth . 
  ok then . 
  lets start with the cash . 
  you need some sort of guideline about how much cash you have . 
  according to [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/04/23/two-rules-of-asset-allocation-to-follow-at-any-age/#5e24b5cdf6f7 ) , a traditional rule is `` 100 minus your age in percent '' , which means if you 're 31 , keep a maximum of 31 % of your portfolio in capital-stable assets like hisas , term deposits , bonds etc. 
  if you read the article , you 'll see that rule of thumb is now more like `` 125 minus your age '' , which gives you an indication that you 're quite overweight in cash . 
  ( obviously , this does n't really apply if you need a lot of that cash for something , like starting a business . 
  in that case , that sum should n't be part of your investment portfolio as it 's allocated elsewhere ), 
  as far as * actual * investments go , work out what percentage of assets you want in yield ( i.e. 
  gives you actual money in your bank account ) vs what percentage of assets you want as growth ( gives you capital gains when you sell ) . 
  you want a mix , even if you plough all the yield money into your portfolio each year , because when the market is down , where are you going to find the money to capitalise on the cheap prices without yield investments giving you a steady stream of money ? 
  a traditional ` balanced ' portfolio is 50 % yield , 50 % growth , but there 's lots of other ratios that are commonly used , such as 70/30 , 30/70 or whatever . 
  if you look at the breakdown of many super funds and managed funds , they will usually say what their target ratio is . 
  read up a bit and make a choice . 
  you need to take into account your job as well as your age - if you have a steady job , you can afford to be more aggressive in your investment . 
  if your job is vulnerable to downturns , though , maybe you should be more cautious . 
  the important thing is to choose a ratio you 're comfortable with , and tweak every few years . 
  once you 've determined your ratio , start thinking of what you want in each bucket of assets . 
  * australian shares provide yield ( franked dividends ) and growth , although the exact mix differs for each company . 
  that 's why vhy has a different mix of companies to vas . 
  you look to already have a lot of yield-providing shares . 
  maybe you 're happy with that ; maybe you want to sell off some underperforming shares and diversify across an index with an etf . 
  you decide . 
  * property-related assets are * usually * yield-related as well . 
  of course we all know how weird the domestic housing market is , so there 's that . 
  personally , i think you * should * treat property as a yield investment , and not count on the ridiculous capital gains we 've seen recently . 
  * international shares tend to provide growth rather than yield ( vgs is something like 80 or 90 % growth ) . 
  you have fuck-all international exposure , so that might be something you can look at bumping up . 
  getting international diversification , at the same time as getting into the capital gains area instead of straight income . 
  * small companies are usually very growth-oriented , as are emerging markets . 
  look at etfs and managed funds to get an idea of how much of your portfolio you should invest there . 
  usually it 's only a small part of your portfolio . 
  tldr ; look at the asset allocations of super and managed funds and try to do something vaguely similar , based on your circumstances . 
  also it means any hero standing near a creep wave is in for a world of hurt . 
  they 'll get nuked once from the aghs , then pl will send all the illusions to rush at him . 
  i wonder if doppel would benefit from extending the durations of illusions when cast . 
  it 's the kind of buff that only pl could benefit from - spawning a bunch of jux illusions , then doppelling over a cliff and keeping them all for the net jungle camp . 
  would pl get a boost if he could do that again ? 
  or would it get ridiculous ? 
  well , ever since 6.85 or so pl has been played more of a split-pusher ( bot-rush ) , just to get the amount of farm he needs . 
  right now , if he actually joins team fights , he 's just fodder . 
  the only power spike pl has is when he gets diffusal , and unless he ruthlessly capitalises on that timing window , he wo n't get the items to let him survive in the late game . 
  add rest and hostplus to your list of funds to look at . 
   it could be a gun . 
  i would n't go that far .

  a lot of companies now have panels of staffing companies instead of going public via seek or whatever . 
  a lot of those companies have a mixed recruitment/consultant model , so they 'll submit people they already know and work with rather than trying to find random people off the internet . 
  that , plus the evisceration of the junior end by offshoring , makes it really difficult for grads .
