   my builds usually are treads , aquila , dlances , raindrops and yasha then finish manta skadi and butterfly . 
  so you 're saying [ phase , basher , daedelus ] ( https://www.opendota.com/matches/2999276575 ) is not optimal ? 
   disulfiram, 
  better known by east asians as `` how i * normally * feel when i drink '', 
  i have n't found any au-domiciled tech indexes . 
  ishares has three or four sector-specific indexes but does n't have one for tech . 
  you may have to go to a us exchange for vgt , iyw and other tech etfs . 
  mandatory voting means politicians pander to the centre rather than the party faithful . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  abbott was elected because , as a country , australia swung right for a while . 
  only meepo prime . 
  ok , so bulk discounts per user, 
  cmc is 11/trade . 
  ig is $ 8 per trade , but does n't do full chess sponsorship . 
  because extremism sucks . 
  i 'm surprised you even have to ask , given what you guys are going through . 
  implying checks and balances existed there . 
  otherwise it just [ looks like this ] ( http://investigations.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9-these-live-chicks-were-ground-up-in-this-typical-macerator-at-another-hatchery.-.jpg ) . 
  he also had a lot of bad luck in his career . 
  i mean , he was pretty close to dying that time that someone 's skate went through his leg . 
  i believe the best option is to change the world * while bringing the mainstream along with yiu *, 
  i think i 'll try treads/blink/medallion / blademail/crest on lc . 
  being lied to , probably . 
  no , because if employees pay for it , they 'd ask for higher wages . 
  works fine for australia . 
  i 'm not even 1.5 k. 
  more correctly , they half arsed their stimulus package and now they ca n't afford to do it any more . 
  depending on the regulatory environment . 
  i mean , when 30 % of the cost gets discounted by the government , you ca n't expect an ideal market . 
  also the sex party . 
  they should make a coalition with the fishers party `` the sex and drugs and rock and roll coalition '', 
  i thought it was only hard to change leaders if you are actually in power at the time . 
  well some people just like to be in charge . 
  perth to the alice gets a bit less cruisy though . 
  i 'd probably get something else , although saving for buy back is a priority . 
  $ 150k per year * after tax * is a lot of fucking money . 
  that 's after tax . 
  gross income is over 220k, 
  for $ 19 i hope you got whipped feta with that . 
  not even close, 
  il locale on angove has a milennials special that 's good . 
  now it 's your turn to provide a source to back up your assertion . 
  yeah not bad . 
  i also like seven grams , they 're about three blocks away on the main road . 
  they do really good chicken . 
  op already upgraded the thing . 
  step 2 : do n't * not * be suma1l, 
  cooldown works with items like manta as well though . 
  yeah but you should know your percentage . 
  but exercising can increase your total energy expenditure by up to 20 % , due to burning energy , increasing your metabolic rate and muscle growth . 
  you 'd * think * that , but i 'm not so sure that reflects reality in recent years . 
  that does n't say whether contractors get paid more or less than aps workers though , which is what he 's asking . 
   or better phrased if you are jealous of the wage a contractor gets why not quit and take the risk of losing your job every day at a directors whim . 
  as a contractor , i calculate that uncertainty into my daily rate . 
  this also goes for melee supports like ogre , who ca n't ( easily ) deward high ground . 
  plus you can share some with other heroes i guess . 
  okay . 
  so how does that mean that contract workers get * less * , like / u/bdsee implied ? 
  or perhaps bdsee posted a statement that could be misinterpreted . 
  judging by the replies and how controversial / u/google _ academic 's reply is , a ** lot ** of people are confused about what 's being argued here . 
  ok can you clarify please ? 
  which ` workers ' are you talking about ? 
  contract workers or aps workers ? 
  well it is n't , because half the people replying think you meant the opposite . 
  lc works best against, 
  * melee heroes ( especially melee carry ), 
  * supports with dot instead of nukes ( warlock , disruptor etc ), 
  then the lib/nationals attacked . 
  redbacks are tiny , and funnel webs build their webs in holes in the ground . 
  he * still is * the founder of vanguard , but he was , too . 
  again , ccp got a hardware partner to pay some of their costs . 
  they used it , in part , to get the company up to speed with unreal engine , which seems to have succeeded . 
  salary sacrificing to super is probably not going to do much . 
  even the 9.5 % mandatory super is close to the yearly cap . 
  do you have a family ? 
  if so , a family discretionary trust might be a good way to share some of your assets and/or income around between people on different tax brackets . 
  good for capital gains stuff . 
  if you 're keen , then you can actually set up your own investment company . 
  the benefit is that the income it earns is taxed at the company tax rate ( 30 % ) instead of your marginal rate . 
  the downside is that it needs to be administered properly , which costs time and/or money . 
  also you do n't get capital gains discount . 
  do you have private health insurance ? 
  the medicare level surcharge would be 1.5 % at your pay level , which is  $ 3000/year in extra tax . 
  you 're 99 % likely to find health insurance that costs less than that . 
  also , consider income protection insurance . 
  yes , it 's an extra cost . 
  it 's tax-deductible though , and if something unfortunate and permanent happens at work ( or 4wding , or whatever ) , it might be the difference between a shit rest of your life and a half-decent one . 
  yeah if you choose lc vs anti mage get the cool down reduction . 
  works on her abilities for more duels as well as items so you get bkb , blink and blade mail again faster . 
  pro tip get poor man 's shield , it stops bugs from damaging you . 
  yes they still affect your armor so you need to get rid of them , but at least you are n't being eaten as well . 
  also stops bugs from disabling blink etc. 
  the abed effect, 
  the tax office closed a lot of loopholes like that . 
  unless you are running an actual business , it counts as personal services income and the tax office treats it as wages . 
  anyway it 's only really worth it after a year or two at the high income so you have money to invest . 
  if you want i could chase up the contact details for a planner who does that for someone i know . 
  obviously do your research because i 'm just a guy on the internet , but it 's a starting point . 
  let it be . 
  well , you can still have specialised indexes for stuff like that if you look hard enough .
