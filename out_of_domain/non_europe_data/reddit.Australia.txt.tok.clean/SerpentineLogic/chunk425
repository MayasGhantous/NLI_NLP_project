  the main thing is that passive funds ** do n't make decisions ** , but active ones do . 
  the most popular type of passive fund , index funds , operate on the rule `` i will buy equal amounts of each of the stocks in this index , and i will perform almost exactly as well as the index does . '' . 
  even in cases where a human or algorithm could `` see it coming '' , the index fund will not budge from that until the index itself drops or adds a stock . 
  active funds when the indexes are ` bad ' , i.e. 
  doing a bit of research will eliminate underperformers , leaving you with , on average , better overall performance in a market . 
  ( this also has to compensate for occasional mistakes and bad luck ) it 's been said that emerging markets and small cap stocks are good for actively-managed funds , as are speculative markets to avoid obvious dogs . 
  however , even in those markets , there are cases where one company comes out of nowhere and makes huge gains . 
  there 's always a risk that an actively-managed fund will miss out on these major wins , whereas an index would catch them . 
  that 's part of the reason why buffett 's research on funds showed that active funds could not consistently reach the benchmark of the relevant index over the long term , because random chance can mean a huge missed opportunity . 
  nope , thread got locked . 
   the brisbane amateur beekeepers ' society inc. meets on the first thursday of each month ( except january ) in the brisbane city council library meeting room on level two of the sunnybank hills shoppingtown , cnr compton & calam rds . 
  in lc 's case , it 's because there 's a lot of players who play lc as `` blink duel the carry , get a victory then die to the rest of the team '' , trusting that your teammates can win the 4v4 . 
  this play style also eventuates when you miss your pick-off window and the enemy team 5-mans all the time , so duels become super risky . 
  in this play style , a reduced death timer changes from a speculative benefit to a certain benefit /, 
   pa , am , juggernaut are pretty much the only somewhat regular ones left . 
  am because he has blink , and pa and jugg because they are melee agility carries passive physical damage amp ( crits ) . 
  still more expensive than cmc . 
  dota buff tells you what the meta is . 
  open dota tells you about * your * games . 
  depends on your win rate . 
  if it 's above 60 % , keep doing normal matches since the wins will still raise the mmr that you start calibration at . 
  a second point in e makes a big difference to sustain . 
  is it worth it , given the existence of shrines ? 
  that 's up to you . 
  i like tango + talon ( buy stout next ) with e w e build . 
  the opportunity to stack is reduced because of the longer spawns ( stacking a camp at minute 1 is risky since you ca n't clear it early so you effectively lose the camp ) so you usually show in a lane after the 2 minutes rune . 
  so basically [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ahjdfmz.jpg ) . 
  it 's the hugo boss uniforms . 
  so dashing . 
  this is why unions get into politics . 
  well , they all have fairly low management fees . 
  as far as percentage return goes : `` past results may not reflect future results '' . 
  see fireoneday 's link for more details about some of the more popular funds . 
  ever considered setting up unite , unitedvoice or rffwu in your location ? 
  i know they can be pretty socialist , but given that the sda was set up in the 50 's as an anti-socialist ` grouper ' union , it seems fitting . 
  united ( vic socialists ), 
  unitedvoice, 
  retail and fast food workers union ( new ), 
  in the 50 's , there was a backlash against socialists , and a number of non-socialist groups were formed to compete against unions . 
  most failed , but the sda succeeded and continues to this day . 
  perhaps the alp should divert some money towards encouraging workers to ditch the sda for a competing union , then . 
  if there 's a job to do and it takes four people to do it , why would you hire a fifth ? 
  then the alp should talk to the actu and get them to help make the competing unions not shit . 
  i mean , the alp is n't expected to know how farming works like the nationals , or whatever , but unions is kinda its core area of expertise . 
  second place gets a nibble . 
  3rd and 4th still get a bit . 
  ok , unite is * super fucking socialist * . 
  the rest are just normal socialist . 
  it does apply . 
  that 's * why * i made the comment . 
  businesses will hire exactly the number of staff they need and no more . 
  why do you ask ? 
  well not in this case . 
  are you paying the sda each week ? 
  many places take that out of your pay by default . 
  at least while humans still drive trucks . 
  ah , i suspected something like that would happen sooner or later . 
  ok . well , should you be tempted , the sda fees [ work out to ] ( https://www.sda.com.au/about-us/join-sda/ ) :, 
  * 1 to 9 hours per week : $ 3.95 a week i.e. 
  $ 205.40 / year, 
  * 10 to 19 hours per week : $ 6.80 a week i.e. 
  $ 353.60 / year, 
  * 20 hours or more per week : $ 9.50 a week i.e. 
  whereas raffwu 's [ fees ] ( http://www.raffwu.org.au/membership ) are :, 
  * under 18 years of age : $ 2 per week or $ 120 per year, 
  * adult casual : $ 3.70 per week or $ 182.40 per year ( discounted ), 
  * adult < 20 hours : $ 6 per week or $ 296.40 per year ( discounted ), 
  * adult 20 + hours : $ 9 per week or $ 410.40 per year ( discounted ), 
  so , under no circumstances is sda cheaper , and in fact if you 're a junior , sda is way more expensive . 
  i find a `` gather for smoke '' ping and drawing on the map where i think we should go has a fair amount of success . 
  i do n't do it often or insistently , though . 
  popping a bkb at the start of a teamfight makes it a lot easier to win it . 
  the enemy team 's choices are to either fight at a disadvantage , or back off until the timer expires , and see whether it makes sense to re-engage afterwards . 
  the timer gets shorter , so as the game progresses , its impact becomes less and less and soon may not be even worth a slot . 
  however , if you can force teamfights at really important locations while you have a long-duration bkb , then you either win the teamfight , or they back off and you take a t3 or rax or rosh and get a significant advantage . 
  tldr ; do n't blow your bkb on meaningless fights or you wont have it when it 's time to push high ground . 
  the russian defence . 
  fyi :, 
  1 . e4 e5, 
  idk , i rarely jungle with lc , since at my mmr we all dual offlane . 
  a wand and raindrops is usually all the mana i need to get off some sick nukes . 
  i find that , with shrines and the slower jungle respawns , i 'm usually in and out of the jungle faster so long-term sustain is much less of a priority . 
  friend request to good players you meet in game . 
  change your name in dota for a while then , to include `` new '' or whatever . 
  people do n't look at profiles often . 
  best of luck getting out of lp . 
  never been there but i hear it 's not fun . 
  yes , that 's part of the punishment of low priority, 
  * limited choice of heroes, 
  * only get to play with others who have lp ( or party members ), 
  * only wins count towards getting out of lp, 
  enterprise bargaining agreements often ( always ? ), 
  have a no disadvantages test . 
  that is , you ca n't bargain below the award rate for your industry , no matter what kind of perceived deal you get in return . 
  so even if you are on an eba , the bar has been lowered for future rounds of negotiation . 
  well just the stats are more efficient than dragon lance so if you can handle the build up and do n't have a pressing need for anything else , sure . 
  as a 5 , if i have the gold i will buy it and put it in the inventory of my 3 or 4 . 
  i ca n't be everywhere on the map at once . 
  sometimes it 's just better to give others the tools they need . 
  that 's more of a * fusion * dish .
