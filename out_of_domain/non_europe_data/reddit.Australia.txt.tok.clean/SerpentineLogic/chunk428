  got it . 
  i 's rather have 3 experts in one field each , than three generalists . 
  depends on the government , but assuming something mainstream like a hawke/keating government , yeah sure definitely . 
  well how else would i get ti predictions ? 
  government sets up regulatory frameworks for some areas , and operates directly in other areas . 
  a competently-set up framework can be envisaged that results in government-run health care being superior to the current system . 
  a competently-set up framework can ** also ** be envisaged that results in a mixed public/private system being superior to the current system . 
  conversely , either of those systems , if badly-operated or deliberately modified , would result in inferior outcomes to what we have now . 
  but muh american exceptionalism, 
  it starts out like that , but soon enough you 're hallucinating that you 're dancing with your dead husband in the summer rain . 
  well , we work with what we have . 
  first , you need to work out your buy price . 
  add up all the transfers you made over the years and that 's your cost ( note that you 'll have to separate the purchases you made within 12 months because cgt is applied differently ), 
  so if you paid in $ 20,000 over the years , you stand to make a $ 10k capital gain . 
  the ato will work out what tax you pay , so that 's nice . 
  if you want to reduce that tax , then the best way is to sell off underperforming investments ( who have a capital loss ) in the same financial year as you made the gain , so you can make a lower net capital gain . 
  just like howard - after a certain amount of time your party just goes full retard and needs some sense knocked into them . 
  we tried \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i thought it was a nerf to autoexec users . 
  the delay was added while you still could . 
  latest patch disabled those modes until later this week . 
  probably someone saw dollar signs and tried to do identity theft and take it all . 
  i 'd work 12hrs x 4 days on , 4 days off . 
  i can understand why people would n't , though . 
  [ mandatory 9.5 % + whatever you sal sac ] must be below the limit per financial year . 
  this fy it 's $ 30k ( more if you 're 50 + ), 
  next fy it 's $ 25k, 
  if you do n't have a web site , then hook up with the crowdcarnivore guys and become a supplier . 
  that 's why sites like crowdcarnivore exist - you do n't need friends if you have random strangers over the internet . 
  technically , you make [ shopping cart items ] ( https://crowdcarnivore.com.au/campaign/south-bukalong-beef-sydney-act/ ) for each cow . 
  that 's a technically-correct but highly misleading answer . 
  it 's $ 30k before you pay normal , or increased tax , no matter how you slice it . 
  i try to follow / r/politics but i 'm getting pretty fucking tired of eating popcorn . 
  the non halal bolt guns are way higher power . 
  the animals * never * recover from them . 
  airlines run a lot closer to the bone than you 'd think . 
  sounds a lot like heresy , battle brother . 
  i think buying more property would be putting too many eggs in one basket . 
  see if your super fund has advisors because at your age , there are many super related options available to you that others do n't have . 
  i 'm worried about the militarisation issues though . 
  the pinoys i encounter online are always suggesting i put a tank in a mall . 
  the most surprising thing about ccp in recent years has been their decision to use unreal engine instead of rolling their own for , what , the fourth time ? 
  making it rain : okay, 
  making it hail : not okay . 
  that 's probably a bad way to do it . 
  a better idea would be for your parents to lend you $ 200,000 at 0 % interest , with a repayment schedule of ` at will ' . 
  that way , it 'll just come out of your inheritance , and you wo n't have to worry about getting married and losing half of it in the divorce , or any problems with gift laws . 
  ** edit : ** also much fairer if you have siblings ( see inheritance ), 
  probably best to clear out the mortgage . 
  it 's low risk , and guaranteed return on your money , from the interest savings ( even though you 're down to 5 figures , congrats btw ), 
  work out how much money you want as spending money each month ( i suggest spending < 50 % of your take-home , but depending on your fi target you might need to clamp down further ) . 
  the rest goes into your loan , and after that 's paid off will go into other investments . 
  as far as investments go , you might want to diversify - you have $ 750k in residential property ( not a particularly liquid investment because it 's a bitch to sell and move out ) , but there 's so many other markets you could be into . 
  if you are keen , you can look into getting an investment loan backed by the equity in your house to kickstart your portfolio . 
  try not to go overboard and leverage yourself into disaster , but if you can get a loan for 6 % and the market rises 6.5 % * and you can afford the repayments * , it can work out well . 
  otherwise , save up and buy stuff every 3 months . 
  possibly , but a competent loan person will realize the situation and cater for it . 
  you just fell into a sarchasm . 
  americans cutting corners ? 
  well i never . 
  well , for me , the thread on the jar was too small for the lid , and it would pop off when filled with tea and inverted , with predictably tragic results . 
  this would soak the wood parts of the lid , which then split and made the seal even worse . 
  from what i hear , others had problems with the glass bottom being too thin and being vulnerable to cracking , not being safe at the agreed-upon temperature range , and generally not being manufactured to spec . 
  the autotrucks in logan were really good though . 
  coal industry, 
  cigarette industry, 
  both lie about their smoke . 
  if you have good super and you do n't need the money until you retire , then putting it into super can be advantageous ( zero tax going in , zero tax while it accumulates , zero tax coming out ), 
  unless you rely on the insurance from one of the super plans ( it does happen ) , then consolidating is good . 
  idk i 'm just a guy on the internet, 
  are any of the companies in that sector in an asx index ? 
  emerging companies ? 
  small ordinaries ? 
  ok , growth is one thing . 
  huge body corporate fees because the maintenance cost shoots through the roof because the builder was more interested in churning out blocks of flats than doing a good job - well , that 's happening a lot more in recent years ... 
  i dunno , but i have seen a lot of fifo workers try to buy property in the eastern states and get burned . 
  laissez-faire * and * free-market economics does n't make sense . 
  lf is `` we 'll start with a free market and if it changes to a non-free market , well thats what the market wants '', 
  fm is `` we want a free market and we 're not afraid of stepping in to keep that market free '', 
  i do n't see the issue . 
  you have $ 100 in costs and charge it to the customer for $ 120 just like any other business . 
  does n't matter whether it 's t-shirts , fixing roofs or online marketing . 
  even australian instant coffee is better than american instant coffee . 
  if you ever have to send a secret santa to a yank , put in some moccona . 
   op passes the charges straight on to the client with no mark up . 
  are you sure ? 
    i pay for the adwords and management fee and send my client an invoice with the advertising costs * plus my own fees . 
  also / r/brisbanejobs ? 
  well , how else are forbes subscribers going to get their dota news fix ? 
  this just in : greedy people are greedy . 
  but then i 'd have to think of different things to put in my secret santa box . 
  wow really ? 
  charming . 
  if you 're really stuck , you can try internationally ( or online ) since you have a legit prescription . 
  you 're stating the rules for concessional contributions , which does not apply here . 
  if op puts any money into super , it will be non-concessional . 
  i go with vgs because the bad tax situation of veu eliminates most of the gains of going direct . 
  might as well choose the easier option . 
  vts is fine because it pays us tax on its domestic earnings and we have a tax treaty that gives us a discount on our australian tax of the same amount . 
  unless your marginal tax rate is less than 15 % you wo n't lose out .
