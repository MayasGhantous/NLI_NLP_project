  i started with * adventure * . 
  it 's hard to complain about modern graphics when in the first game you played , your character was a single pixel the size of your fist . 
  the lash : third-most popular reason to enlist in the navy . 
  internet delivers . 
  from the eligible bachelor pool on reddit ? 
  you wo n't like what we send you . 
  2 plex = $ 70 . 
  if you make $ 70/hour , that 's about $ 135k/year . 
  trust me on this . 
  making $ 70/hour *** after *** tax is a lot more impressive - about $ 220k assuming a tax rate of 40 % . 
  just wait for the new shield boosters in inferno , then . 
  ... and then loses his wyvern . 
  i 'm fairly certain that selling out-of-game stuff like beta keys ( whether for dust or any other game ) for in-game money counts as rmt and is not cool with ccp . 
   why would they allow this ? 
  the taliban shot people for growing opium . 
  us troops kinda ca n't do that . 
  small [ ancillary shield booster ] ( http://pastebin.com/drkisrpt ), 
  * +52 hp for 48gj ( possibly doubled boost and cap use after balance changes ), 
  * 2 second cycle time, 
  * 10m ^ 3 capacitor for cap boosters ( i.e. 
  10 x cap booster 25 ), 
  * ** does not use ships capacitor when using cap boosters **, 
  * 60 second reload of cap boosters once you run out ( turn auto-reload off for this module ), 
  * can be run without cap boosters, 
  sov = sovereign space . 
  npc null is null-security space that is under npc faction sovereignty . 
  for instance , syndicate is controlled by the [ intaki syndicate ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/intaki_syndicate_%28npc_corporation%29 ) , which lets anyone dock up at their stations , no matter how disreputable . 
  this allows corporations and alliances to enjoy the benefits and risks of null-sec life without the hassle of waking up at 3am to defend their sovereign space or risk having all their assets locked away in a now-hostile station . 
  low-sec incursions are [ pretty exciting ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/sons-of-bitch.html ) . 
  you picked an [ excellent time ] ( http://hulkageddon5.machine9.net/ ) to start mining again . 
  there are n't many games that you can pick up again after six years and still get blown away by the graphics . 
  i hear that fosters overseas is just rebadged crown lager . 
  the amusing thing is that , generally , the kiwis moving to australia are the more-motivated ones , which leaves nz stuck with all the people too slack to get on a plane . 
  that 's a win for us ...

  yeah i run slightly below the standard high settings on my macbook . 
  it runs fine ; the only problem is when it hits 80 degrees c and makes like a helicopter taking off . 
  i respectfully [ disagree ] ( http://www.bit-101.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/yeah-well-you-know-thats-just-like-your-opinion-man.jpg ) . 
  fweddit is a post-cultural revolution corp and , just like faction warfare is sov warfare lite ^ tm , fweddit * can be * dreddit without being insular and mean-spirited . 
  fweddit : the dr jekyll to dreddit 's mr hyde . 
  define casual . 
  if you mean `` i do n't have a lot of time to play '' , then trade and industry allow you to get a lot done while offline . 
  heck , i do n't even have to login until 3d11h40m from now , since that 's when my next lot of capital components is done . 
  if you mean `` i want to login and have fun and not care too deeply '' then perhaps the always-on combat rush of red vs blue ( or faction warfare ) is more up your alley . 
  fact is , unless you live in syndicate , generic small gang fights are a whole lot of looking for fights and not a lot actually fighting . 
   unless of course their waving sound arguments and evidence in your face , which i imagine is not only rare but welcome . 
  usually they 're waving something * entirely different * in your face . 
  in that case , join fweddit and get in on the ground floor of faction warfare . 
  [ most violent regions ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats ) ( last 24hrs ), 
  syndicate is usually on top , and has been for years . 
  i am somewhat concerned by not releasing a tech 1 module as a bpo . 
  i really would prefer if they were bpcs for meta-1 modules instead , to keep consistency with , well , all nine years of eve . 
  i think the point is that you can have in-jokes without needing to be dicks . 
  i think it 's just a shortcut to forging an identity via wedge politics , which is fine * if * you like being wedged in that direction . 
  already legal . 
  i would say that if someone is * trying * to sexually arouse other people , it 's lewdness . 
  it 's hardly a recent technique , and i reject the assertion that it is used by all groups . 
  there 's a difference between making shared experiences to forge a group dynamic , and deliberately taking a controversial position to polarise the member base and , through external persecution , reinforce the stability of the group . 
   the game has increased its player base pretty much every year since it came out .

  have you never seen * [ cabaret ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabaret_%28musical%29 ) * ?

  hipster latham : attacking labor before it was mainstream . 
  is it really beattie and latham 's fault that craig thompson is such a douche ? 
  was it a black london cab , or a different company ? 
  tuppence per yard . 
  no , you 're thinking of steven seagal . 
  to be honest that 's the only thing keeping her from being dumped . 
  tyl . 
  remember you can only change accessories and clothes - you ca n't change your bone structure ( or expression , i think ) . 
  ( unless you pay ccp for a full resculpt ), 
  also : core targeting is a bit of a trap . 
  unless you are a logistics or carrier pilot , you do n't need targeting v.

  planetary extraction is a small , but steady source of income for newbies . 
  more importantly , the income happens even while you 're not logged in .

  * extractor : 45,000.00 isk, 
  * basic industrial facility : 75,000.00 isk, 
  yes , if you buy the planetology skills , it will cost another 2.5 m isk , but a basic setup is pretty cheap .

  again . 
   faction warfare can be profitable if you do it right , but early on not so much . 
  after inferno , this will change a lot . 
  get on a few killmails with your t1 frigate and you 'll start racking up the loyalty points . 
  core targeting is terrible though . 
  convincing a newbie to train targeting v is just wrong . 
  you learned a valuable lesson in trust and retaining control , then . 
  this is actually why i started playing eve : to learn how not to be the ` nice guy ' . 
  i now have trained uncaring v and am starting on tactical bastardy specialization . 
  [ post the lossmail ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/how_to_post_a_killmail ) please ( obviously , post to [ eve-kill ] ( http://eve-kill.net/?a=post ) instead of attempting to post to eve university 's killboard ), 
  i think a vexor would be a better choice for a gallente pve fit .
