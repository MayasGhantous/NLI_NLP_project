  then we should treat that as a societal health issue . 
  meth is directly neurotoxic to dopamine receptors and prolonged use leads to parkinsons and other , expensive medical problems . 
  if the government would legalise stuff like that , it would be normal amphetamines rather than meth . 
  idk , i see a * lot * of money spent trying to convince people not to be super-drunkards . 
  well , there 's urn ... but drums does have that move speed bonus . 
  why not both ? 
  so the government actually * does * have problems with legal recreational drugs that essentially poison addicts to death . 
  wait , it has to be * your own * penis ? 
  that explains a lot . 
  i bet they let all their employees know to avoid that phrase .

   what is your cultural representative chest ? 
  [ this one ] ( https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/croc-o-style_kit ), 
  you really need more explanation around, 
  `` hurt '' vs `` shame '' vs `` embarrassment '' vs `` guilt '', 
  it is n't just your target demographic , but * people in general * do n't understand the differences . 
  i just made a wild guess , like, 
  * shame = ' i suck ', 
  * embarrassment = ` fuck , they found out ', 
  * guilt = ' i know i fucked up ', 
  but others will probably arrive at different definitions , and it will affect the results . 
  i thought phantom rush was bugged because it does n't trigger until after the first hit ? 
  right , but that first hit does n't have the +24 agility so it 's a lot less impactful than you 'd expect . 
  yeah there 's a technique where you ( attempt to ) abuse phantom rush by doppelling and rushing your entire control group at a single target to burst them down , but it does n't work nearly as well as it should .

  it 's a fact of small business ownership that you need to plan for this , because there 's a lot more on the line than if you were an employ .

  tldr : putting a proto-vitamin ( nad + ) into their drinking water improved mice 's ability to repair dna damage from simulated radiotherapy . 
  nad + levels naturally drop during old age in both humans and mice , so supplements could show promise .

   ** nad + binding modulates protein interactions **, 
   an unexpected function of the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nad + ) could underlie some effects of aging and propensity to age-related diseases . 
  found that the protein dbc1 ( deleted in breast cancer 1 ) contains a domain that specifically binds nad + . 
  binding of nad + inhibited the interaction of dbc1 with parp1 [ poly ( adenosine diphosphate -- ribose ) polymerase 1 ] , an enzyme important in dna repair . 
  activity of parp1 is inhibited by interaction with dbc1 . 
  thus , the reduced abundance of nad + associated with aging may decrease parp1 activity by promoting the interaction of parp1 with dbc1 . 
  this mechanism could help explain the reported rejuvenating actions of nad + supplementation in older animals . 
  if they are investments , i care about rental yield and capital growth ( or lack of ) ; cost just determines whether it 's good value or not . 
  also , whether i have a house already makes a difference . 
  yeah , seems to be a fairly recent addition to health food/supplement shops . 
  looks like the chemical they used is available in health food stores ( and online ) but i 'm doubtful how effective it will be in * those * quantities . 
  the studies appear to use fairly high doses :, 
   after a 2-week acclimation period , the young and old mice were divided into two subgroups : control animals ( yc , oc ) continued on normal drinking water and the other animals ( ynmn , onmn ) received nicotinamide mononucleotide ( nmn ; sigma-aldrich corp. , st. louis , mo , usa ) in the drinking water ( ** target dose of 300 mg kg \u2212 1 day \u2212 1 ** ) for 8 weeks . 
  so that 's 24000mg per day for a 80kg person , which means of [ 192 of these pills ] ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b014estb7g?ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=industrial&amp;qid=1490313468&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nmn&amp;sa-no-redirect=1&amp;pldnsite=1 ) per day . 
  um , that 's a lot .

  it 's ten times the amount of plant sterols ( e.g. 
  flora proactiv ) that are needed to reduce cholesterol .
