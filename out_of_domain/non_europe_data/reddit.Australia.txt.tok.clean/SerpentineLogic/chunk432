  well , the study shows that it works really well for recovering from radiotherapy , which is why nasa is interested in it for their mars mission . 
  if you 're talking about the irish , lack of potatoes kills people . 
  itt : buncha people who think getting old only happens to other people . 
  plants can certainly explode if they are lng plants . 
   is 28 to late to bother, 
  well , it 's not as good as if you had some stored when you were younger , but when you 're 70 and need some stem cells , i doubt you 'd be complaining . 
  yeah if you have a desolator then there 's no reason not to hit towers as hard as you can . 
  the more uncertain people are about builds , the more they decide they need help . 
  has the 7.04 patch resulted in any build changes , or is it too early to tell ? 
  start with treads on agi, 
  * double-click treads ( to int ), 
  * pact, 
  * double-click treads ( to str ), 
  * wait for pact to end, 
  * double-click treads ( to agi ), 
  2 loads of regen is generally advised , unless you 're against a solo offlaner . 
  upvoting because it 's a * clever * troll . 
  who the fuck throws policies out there ** before ** conducting the feasibility study ? 
  eventually , companies will solve the delivery issue . 
  i mean , if they can sell juice boxes full of weetbix they 'll find a way to deliver 24g of protovitamins . 
  right now , though , there 's no realistic way for customers get the same dosages as these mice did ( we 're talking $ 200/day worth of those pills ), 
  there seems to be studies from japan backing up this work and human trials have already commenced in 2016 , so if it pans out we 'll hear about it . 
  ultrasound treatments [ show promise ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2016/11/03/on-path-to-alzheimers-cure-australian-team-analyzes-petabytes-of-data/#7d2e532b3d60 ) , once scientists work out how do to it through human skulls instead of mice skulls . 
  `` feels before reals '' . 
   foreign investors are not allowed to buy land in china . 
  the land in china belongs to the state and the collectives . 
  you can * lease * land , but the lease is capped at 40-70 years depending on how it 's zoned . 
   that 's no different for a chinese citizen . 
  * which is why they buy land over here . 
  i think i used thehub for a while but not powerup . 
  hit up the brisbane uni subreddits ? 
  it 's a bit brighter idk . 
  the immortal is pretty cheap though , mise well get it .

  3 cents . 
  i 'm no expert , but i think the * restraints * go under the bed , not * you * . 
  blood goes fast enough as it is . 
  maybe legion ? 
  citations inside here . 
  actually , yeah , i know some visa holders who could double their pay if they were untethered from their sponsor . 
  which would be good for them , and good for the market as a whole . 
  but not good for the sponsor so it will never happen . 
  provided the new homes meet stringent energy efficiency targets . 
  does it matter ? 
  both are equally vulnerable . 
  technically , they do n't have to be 457 , they could be 100 % offshore . 
  my experience has been that if an offshore company wants you , they will pay above market rate because they recognize their existing staff ca n't do the job . 
  i do n't think i 'd feel comfortable taking on a home loan unless i had a 20 % deposit . 
  generally you get better loan terms the more you put in . 
  it needs to be above 10 % or you get hit with extra loan insurance charges . 
  a trust or private company might actually be an option . 
  you ca n't give people nad + directly , it 's toxic . 
  you can give precursors like nmn though . 
  turns out if you give old mice lots of nmn in their drinking water , it gets into their bloodstream and gives them the levels of a young mouse , and that helps dna repair . 
  what leads you to believe that his ultimate goes through spell immunity ? 
  that 's not the same though . 
  link to the thing ? 
  last year , the good super funds grew 9-11 % , so ... 
  ok , so it 's pretty much their share trading platform . 
  probably worse than cba and more expensive than cmc , but if you are already with anz it 's probably more convenient . 
  it 's really more about what you choose to invest in , rather than the platform , at least for the first few years . 
  i have some sort of shit amp product and i got 9 % minus fees . 
  host plus indexed returned over 11 %, 
  idk i 'm just going by their web sites . 
  why not normal goats ? 
  as is tradition, 
  i just discovered ultra , so this is nice . 
  work experience in the middle of the degree . 
  it 's what makes you actually useful to a business . 
  any graduate can program , but far fewer can * develop software * . 
  i would n't go echo on jug . 
  it delays manta or diffusal or whatever . 
  can detour into vanguard for eventual basher . 
  also manta boosts your strength so there 's that . 
  and/or finish manta before diffusal . 
  * i have a target percentage of my net income that gets transferred out each time i get paid ( into offset account or wherever ), 
  * i have a target ratio for stocks ( like `` 50 % international + / - 5 % , 10 % emerging markets + / - 5 % , 5 % individual stocks that i realise i 'm just gambling with '' etc ), 
  * i have a google calendar notification every 3 months to tell me i should check my ratios and convert cash into shares, 
  * i then buy ( or * very * occasionally sell ) shares to keep the ratio correct, 
  * sharesight handles my portfolio tracking . 
  only tournament games have forfeit option , and that 's fine because they will only gg out when they , * a team of professional dota players who have a monetary incentive to win at all costs * , realise that they wo n't win . 
   battle furry, 
  one of my favorites . 
  yeah but how do you cast it, 
  do you need the ruins/slaver lock if you have the wish board with much fewer artifacts to recur ? 
  do you buy urn on lion ? 
  a few tips from a bad player :, 
  you need binds for :, 
  * optionally : hero only, 
  * hero + illusions, 
  * illusions only ( for sending manta illus down a lane , or doing something useful with juxtapose illusions when you ditch them ), 
  * optionally : the tough illusion from doppelganger, 
  being able to send a credible decoy away is great . 
  be aware of your phantom rush cooldown . 
  if someone takes too long to die once they ran out of mana , being able to phantom rush to the next hero , and get a boost to agi is nice . 
  timing your doppelgangers between rushes so you are safe while it cools down is also nice . 
  as far as items go , you obviously need diffusal but it 's prudent to have something more tanky in your quick buy as well , like vanguard or aghs components . 
  mise well have whooping cough shot anyway . 
  also get your parents and relatives to get theirs done . 
  viruses mutate if they 're allowed to proliferate .
