  and then the vaccinations stop working . 
  but viewership in general is dropping . 
  zantac stops those bad effects btw .

  they 're often squishy heroes with low int , so yes .

  brb buying jug arcana, 
  `` i 'm just clearing some debris . 
  i 'm on a clock , you see '', 
  `` now i 'm on a tree branch '', 
  `` now i 'm in the air '', 
  well , friendly bots will choose heroes you suggest with all click , so there 's that . 
  that 's close to wacol prison, 
  acceptable losses . 
  i would have stopped buying individual stocks except for ~ ~ gambling ~ ~ speculative purchases .

  trading virtual goods for btc is [ bartering ] ( https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/in-detail/rules-for-specific-transactions/barter-transactions/bartering-and-barter-exchanges/ ) . 
  in general , the ato will assess sales as ` at fair market value ' which is pretty clear-cut in your case . 
  if someone traded you 0.1 btc on friday , then the income you received was what 0.1 btc was worth on that date . 
  if btc rises after that , well that 's capital gains . 
  so , it does n't matter whether you trade it out of btc or not - it 's exactly the same as if they gave you cash and * you * bought the bitcoin with the money i.e. 
  it 's real income . 
  on another note , good work on the trading . 
  over the years , i have spent a lot of money buying individual stocks . 
  some were good purchases ; others were okay purchases , and a few were terrible purchases ( like , i had $ 10k of a pretty stable stock , oh no it 's now worth $ 150 due to some event i did n't know was happening , like macquarie buying the company and gutting it ) . 
  it would have been much better if i had said `` self , you should not be in these stocks if you are n't paying attention to them '' , and had restricted individual stock purchases to a few gambles in an area that i already pay attention to ( like , if i really liked electric cars then i would have thrown a few thousand at tesla , or if i had any money when google went public , i would have thrown a bit their way ) , but realised that it is gambling and it 's not how you build the core of your investment strategy . 
  caused, 
  he 's the best of what 's left . 
  well you have transaction dates right ? 
  surely you can get the price from coin jar or something ? 
  then you can create a custom holding in share sight to track purchases ( if you just dump it to cash immediately then you could use pocket book or something , but since the price of a btc varies , it 's probably better to treat it as a commodity ), 
  bali is not like other parts of indonesia .

  if you pay rent to your parents , you legit should never * expect * that back . 
  hope , yes , expect , no . 
  so what if your parents put your rent money into a separate account and give it back when it 's time to buy the house ? 
  or if you have siblings , your parents could give you a 0 % loan so it comes off your share of their inheritance instead , for fairness . 
  maybe one day i 'll be as good as a new player . 
  would it be less expensive to send up fuel as a payload and dock with it on a subsequent launch ? 
  well , i just plod along with 55 % win rate and hope for the best . 
  i like the town halls that bernie sanders does . 
  he converts a lot of people who only sided with trump because they felt they had nobody else who voiced their concerns . 
  * relatively * anonymous . 
  it goes into ( or from ) your bank account sooner or later , and that 's enough of a paper trail to link you to your wallet . 
  same thing,

  trains , or ferries if you can swing it . 
  just no . 
  assuming you buy a $ 400k property , you 'll need $ 80k as a reasonable deposit , on top of what you need to grow your business ... 
   which are priced from $ 800,000 to $ 920,000 for a two-bedroom , two-bathroom unit . 
  is that normal ? 
  yeah . 
  i mean , you 're not buying a second house for the fun of it ; you 're doing it to make money . 
  so , you go where the best rewards are for the level of risk you 're willing to accept . 
  having said that , i 'm on < 180k household income but saving 50 % of our take-home is not particularly difficult . 
  depends on the definition of rich . 
  for me ? 
  comfortable : `` let 's take the family to france this year '', 
  rich : `` let 's take the family to france * for * a year . 
  start packing . '', 
  any job is * nowhere near * as good as your job . 
  i 'm joking . 
  you 'd get someone to pack for you . 
  it would be good for the stock market . 
  for hostplus ` choose your own shares ' , it 's $ 258/year + 0.11 % per trade ( minimum $ 20 ) plus you have to do all the trades manually . 
  for ` just give me a balanced mix of index funds ' , it 's $ 78/year + 0.02 % mer . 
  that mer is ridiculously low btw . 
  in counterpoint to your personal anecdote , i think the quality gap between mbp and other laptops has narrowed * considerably * . 
  i think the mbp retina was the high water mark in recent years . 
  check your last pay slip carefully . 
  first 4 people get random heroes ( and lost gold ) , last one gets abandon . 
  oh yeah , i forgot that you can get 7 slotted , with buy back , and still farm moon shards for another core . 
  yeah but, 
  * jobs might be harder to get , and op has one already, 
  * rent might be cheaper but they have that sorted out via girlfriend . 
  if it were me , i would invest 10k and earmark 5k for educational purposes . 
  even something like learning how to pull a beer or make espresso would help you pick up some extra cash . 
  alternatively , a side business might be a thing . 
  like , buy some leather and make good belts or other craft things you can sell . 
  also , accepting a counteroffer is always a mistake . 
  you 've already burned the bridge ; the counteroffer is just to buy the company time to replace you . 
  hell , i 'll poison your m & ms for free . 
  do pre nups not exist any more ? 
  i got nothing, 
  i 'm just sitting here , eating a bowl of poeslaw . 
  pros ditch the off lane because, 
  * pros choose heroes that can catch off laners . 
  * it 's not 2v2 , it 's 3 vs 1, 
  * other pros will punish positioning mistakes,
