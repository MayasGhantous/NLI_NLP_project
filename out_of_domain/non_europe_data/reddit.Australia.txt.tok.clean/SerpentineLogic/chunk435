  depends on your nearest suburb i guess . 
  that still does n't trigger before the first hit . 
  retirees by definition do not pay much tax . 
  keep telling yourself that, 
  no it 's not ; you just sell to the cloud . 
  what about commercial property lic s ? 
  or indeed any that are not the stock market . 
  personally i think staying away from stocks is not a good long term plan because it crimps your diversity but that 's on you . 
  / r/iwantout, 
  is it , really ? 
  that 's probably a good idea, 
  * work for the dole costs the government more than regular dole ( more effort from centrelink , more money paid out in inducements ), 
  * work for the dole does n't help the unemployed - the employers wo n't spend effort training people actual useful skills , and it * costs * the unemployed time and money just to turn up and work, 
  * work for the dole actually increases unemployment , because given the choice of hiring an actual employee , or some el-cheapo wfd people to clear up a building site , what do you think employers will choose ? 
  so , it costs more , pisses people off , * and * makes the unemployment stats worse . 
  also it does n't work . 
  there 's no gift tax in australia , although if the ato thinks you 're trying to scam them ( gifting your builder $ 10k , and * coincidentally * getting a concrete driveway for free ) then they 'll fuck you up . 
  free game no bitching, 
  yeah but after bronwyn bishop , those helicopters are just sitting idle . 
  is that the new one at the end of queen street ? 
  feelsaustralianman, 
  or devops if that floats your boat : https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/263614076/, 
  bhp and rio would be content selling iron at $ 25 , which still represents 25 % profit . 
  set dota_health_per_vertical_marker 250 ? 
  so , maybe , but more likely you 'll see increased volatility across the market but not necessarily a slump in a * particular * stock . 
  because they * do * want to get elected, 
  it was 5 hours away by car . 
  they could have hired a limo for the price they were offering passengers to disembark . 
  there 's many reasons you can deny entry to a plane , but * much * fewer reasons to kick someone off a plane if they have a valid , paid ticket . 
  transportation law in the us is quite clear on this , as united will soon find out . 
  i think it 's a good solution to biomass that otherwise would be burnt fully and go up in smoke . 
  i bought bhp at $ 49 : cry :, 
  til football coaches are sociopaths . 
  host plus and rest have strong offerings , as do uni super and australian super . 
  i saw a chart about 2 years ago that showed they had the worst ten year performance of all the major funds they listed ( they charted about 30 funds ) so i gave them a miss . 
  ca n't find which site i got it from though . 
  what issues in particular ? 
  if you are n't close by a ski area , it 's very tempting to fly to new zealand to ski instead . 
  yeah sure , except for the coincidental cut and paste of talking points . 
  in that case , work out what percentage you save of your after-tax income . 
  40 % is good ; 50 % is great , and 60 % will get you * very * close to fi in 10-15 years . 
  a lot of core banking systems date back to the 70s and 80s and run cobol on mainframes . 
  there are modern alternatives , but they 're * not * guaranteed to be better . 
  on top of that , bank transfers are another layer on top of the core banking system , so the whole thing runs at the slowest speed of :, 
  * sending bank, 
  * transfer system, 
  * receiving bank, 
  gym membership : $ 15/week, 
  health food : $ 40/week, 
  that smug feeling when he sees you again : priceless, 
  i 'm with cmc , but then again i do n't have a cba account , so there 's that . 
  how do you even staple spaghetti ? 
  on the other hand , the current 457 system handcuffs workers to their employer . 
  rock the boat about your pay , and it 's back overseas the next day . 
   if an employee is that disposable, 
  well , ultimately we 're * all * replaceable . 
  however , when you come over to australia on $ 57k ( minus fees to your offshoring company ) , then you find out that your coworkers are being paid double or triple that , do n't you think it 's reasonable to call out your employer ? 
   for some indian sysadmin to complain that he only makes $ 60k p.a. 
  whilst his white aussie colleague makes $ 75k, 
  which side are you arguing for ? 
  because for a business , *** the entire point is cheaper labour *** . 
  if a job is so rare that you ca n't fill it within the country , then you should pay market rate , * or * just admit that you 're fucking over your employees for a buck . 
  you wo n't be faster than automated systems . 
  go to the shops and max your credit card on tinned food , petrol and iodine . 
  bonus points if you swing by bunnings and pick up tools , supplies and a portable generator . 
   the first panel beater we took it to this morning said that since it 's the other lady 's fault she should be the one to get quotes, 
  that 's neither here nor there - you can contact her insurance company and find out . 
  maybe they 'll just ask for the quotes from you . 
   and he also said since there 's $ 4-5k worth of damage in a car which is probably worth $ 8k . 
  that it 's not worth fixing . 
  that 's 100 % not up to him , even if he 's correct . 
  her insurance company makes that call . 
  personally , i 'd call your insurance company - not to make a claim , but to report the incident and ask what you should do . 
  maybe they will say `` we 'll pay for the repairs , then her insurance will pay us '' . 
  maybe they 'll say something else . 
  either way , if it 's not your fault they wo n't be particularly upset . 
  from my experience , this is how it goes . 
  * sandeep is hired by an indian managed service company , like hcl or wipro or infosys , because he has experience in some obscure piece of software . 
  * that company gets a contract to provide devs , testers etc for a large company like a bank or whatever . 
  * sandeep is assigned as one of 150 devs working on this project . 
  * the australian team recognises that sandeep is pretty good , and says `` it would be great if we could bring him onshore for a few months to train him up in the next phase of the project , instead of having to deal with this bullshit 5 hour time zone difference '', 
  * sandeep comes over at the 457 statutary minimum rate of $ 57k/year for it, 
  * sandeep comes over , does his job , and shows that he 's not a dickhead . 
  * sandeep then finds out that he 's being charged out at $ 2000 a day because it 's really hard to find people experienced in setting up bearer-token saml2 in ois via oag , osb and other obscure acronyms, 
  * sandeep talks to his boss and says `` what 's up with this ? '', 
  * sandeep goes home the next day . 
  that 's one interpretation . 
  i think people like sandeep wo n't be able to head over here without the 457 program , even temporarily , so companies that offshore wo n't be able to have their cake and eat it , too . 
  i mean , if there were n't real advantages to having someone onshore , then you would n't need anyone to come over would you, 
  if all the good developers only accept contract rates , then that rate * is * the going rate . 
  what benefits does going permanent bring that would compensate for a 30 % pay cut ? 
  permanent residency . 
  not a citizen , but no visa required to stay . 
  you misunderstand . 
  the contract rate * is * the going rate . 
  other types of visas . 
  i do n't even know who steve urkel 's ex even is . 
  that 's not been my experience . 
  the permies are only marginally safer than contractors , especially considering their relative levels of employability . 
  you still do n't get it .
