  tldr imagine caffeine crossed with msg, 
  probably does n't make a huge difference , since the tax deduction will put you back into the same tax bracket . 
  if it was 60k to 90k then it might make more of a difference . 
  i 'm going with a big chunk of vgs for now , then mixing in some vge when the ratios allow it . 
  mining boom distortions , i suspect . 
  they spent, 
   so much money, 
  because it was going cost them during the middle of a resources boom where they were profiting by millions * each day * . 
  i mean , it cost about $ 30m to run that ad campaign . 
  if times get really tough , you just spend another $ 30m . 
  job 's done , high fives all round . 
  no , but i 'll likely pick it up after ship breakers . 
  he forgot `` banging hot models '', 
  where do you think the paint on his palette came from ? 
  helm of the slackinator, 
  noone could have predicted this . 
  the hard part about loans is getting someone to repay them . 
  does that open up put/call options if you put market stuff up as collateral ? 
  the ` bad at this ' comment was speaking as the british, 
  paul clitheroe recommends an optimal repayment rate of about double the minimum repayment , as a good tradeoff between saving on interest , and not crippling yourself over it . 
  a lot of people ca n't keep that rate for very long , but it 's something to think about . 
  also , check out : http://www.internationalhouse.uq.edu.au/ ( they have a couple in sydney as well , to serve the universities there ), 
  a lot of exchange students do ; international students from nearby countries often have support networks of their own , so they tend to do the share house thing . 
  ih aims for 50/50 australian-vs-international students , and also 50/50 male-vs-female , so it 's quite the melting pot . 
  it also does n't have any of the macho bullshit that some of the other residences have . 
  they did n't try the philippines ? 
  i do n't have a dog in this fight , but i 've read some good articles from her , and some that were a * real * stretch . 
  so , should n't you be looking for somewhere around progress road and eastward ? 
  fair enough . 
  the company i work for tried a few different countries and settled on a manila office . 
  aside from the good english skills and close timezone , the pinoys understand our sense of humour so they 're really easy to get along with . 
  having said that , a us company setting up an australian office is not uncommon , probably for similar reasons : right timezone , good communication , get things done . 
  i imagine they 'll go straight to optic fiber , too . 
  none of this coax bullshit . 
  it does n't need to be a conspiracy . 
  someone says something sketchy but links it to anzac day . 
  if they do n't get called out on it , then maybe it propagates to others , and persists for a while . 
  it 's literally what memes * are * . 
  the sikhs wo n't take that lying down , judging by their history . 
  i literally just placed a ( small ) order for vge now . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  veu pays roughly 5.33 % of its distributions in foreign withholding tax ( i.e. 
  tax paid to european countries , which are foreign to the us-domiciled fund ) . 
  ** you ** are unable to claim this as a foreign tax offset . 
  with vgs , you * are * able to claim this as a foreign tax offset , because it 's between the ato and the eurozone without a us company in the middle . 
  this is roughly a 0.197 % delta . 
  averaged across two funds , it 's 0.0985 % . 
  ( there 's no non-us foreign tax on vts , and it 's simply an australia-usa tax arrangement where offsets apply ) . 
  that 's the idea - you have vge as a ( small ) part of your portfolio as a diversification play . 
  the thinking about emerging markets is that there 's more potential upside than developed economies . 
  existing foreign investors would be less sanguine about the situation , but new investors would be pretty happy about it . 
  i bought in at ~ 5 % . 
  i 'm unlikely to go above 10 % . 
  good for producers ( more competitive costs for exports ) . 
  not so good for consumers . 
  93 % of the world 's market cap is in us , europe and sea . 
  even with a bit of wiggle room because some parts of sea are emerging markets , it implies a weighting of 5-10 % of your portfolio ( bearing in mind that you need room in your portfolio for cash and non-stock investments ), 
  read it again . 
  veu actually loses 0.197 % . 
  averaged over a 50/50 veu/vts split it 's 0.098 % waste , so you have to add that amount to ** both ** veu fees and vts fees to compare that against vgs fees . 
  have you compare those fees to just investing in a vanguard growth managed fund ? 
  no brokerage if you invest directly . 
  allows bpay as well . 
  i bet you blame your car when you 're caught speeding . 
  from what i understand , acorns is best for low balances ( < 5k ), 
  after that , for investors who want immediate diversification , then stockspot and other robo investors are desirable . 
  investors who want to eke additional margins by diy rebalancing will tend to go for direct etfs instead , but the fine-grained diversification of managed/robo funds are hard to replicate just because of the effort involved - that 's why they tend to go for 2-4 indexes and leave it at that .

  going keto causes your body to flush a lot of stored sodium , so your salt intake must rise to cope with that . 
  you 're probably not on an average diet if you 're keto . 
  well , inala or thereabouts might be an option . 
  if you go all the way to ipswich , both of your commutes will be in peak flow direction . 
  vitamin k injections save a dozen babies a year . 
  i do n't even . 
  if you speak chinese , the menu at a chinese restaurant gets 50 % bigger due to non western style dishes . 
  like , if you rock up speaking english , good luck getting the soup or oranges . 
  you know , the orange slices or other desserts they give out at the end of the meal . 
  i go vgs over vts + veu . 
  it 's not more complicated than that . 
  i guess you could ask for the oranges after you 've finished eating the other dishes , and see what happens ... 
  i 'd ask at queer friendly societies at university or whatever . 
  trans women probably all go through the same issues : not knowing even makeup 101 and needing some kind of newbie guide . 
  [ the worldly philosophers ] ( https://smile.amazon.com/worldly-philosophers-economic-thinkers-seventh/dp/068486214x ), 
   the worldly philosophers is a bestselling classic that not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times . 
  in this seventh edition , robert l. heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as adam smith and karl marx . 
  the theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas -- namely , the search to understand how a capitalist society works . 
  it is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines .

  i think the government should provide both full and partial scholarships . 
  full ( hecs ) scholarships with high entry requirements , just like the old days , so poor but smart kids get as much of a chance as rich kids . 
  partial ( hecs ) scholarships to help out middle class kids who are n't geniuses , but without ruining the national budget . 
  and everyone else pays full price , so there 's a bit of actual price competition in the tertiary education market .
