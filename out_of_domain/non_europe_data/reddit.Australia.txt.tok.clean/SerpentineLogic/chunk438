  that 's why the coup failed ( assuming it was n't just a pretend coup for him to crack down on ), 
  ned kelly approved, 
  seems like more work rebalancing, 
  what ? 
  today is the labour day public holiday in queensland . 
  ... and ? 
  i would argue against that . 
  an interesting distinction ( compared to e.g anzac day ) but i posit that a day off work is the entire point of labour day , rather than the particular date . 
   if you know someone looking for a part-time/casual gig , has a car , licence and lives north side , brisbane ( or is happy to travel ) please have them get in touch - samantha@crowd.delivery, 
  idk , might be worth looking into . 
  depends on the job . 
  \\ #industry on tweet fleet slack, 
  457 already has a minimum . 
  it just happens to only be 53k . 
  other vanguard etfs for different markets, 
  sounds fine . 
  remember to buy semi regularly , because dollar cost averaging will reduce the swinginess of your portfolio ratios . 
  dude , teenagers will fap to a * stick figure * . 
  depends what you * already * have . 
  i mean , if you already have international exposure then loading up on vgs might be too many eggs in one basket . 
  but if all your investments are domestic instead , then throwing a hundred outside the country makes more sense . 
  like , jenkins ? 
  funny how that works . 
  not mjolnir ? 
  idk choose a value you 're happy with . 
  limit orders are just so you do n't buy or sell for worse than you expect . 
  dude , you may not be a property tycoon but you have a place to call home which * as you know * not everyone can claim . 
  as far as the repayments go , aim to put away anything up to 2x the minimum repayments . 
  if you ca n't get there , that 's cool , but beyond that it 's not really worth the quality of life drop , imo . 
  in your case , it might be putting the maximum of $ 10k into the loan , but saving up a bit more as your emergency fund/put into loan after 2 years kind of deal . 
  you have a lot of direct shares . 
  are you paying attention to them ? 
  i mean , if you 're not simultaneously across the mining , banking and isp industry then you might be caught flat-footed ( source : have been caught flat-footed , lost enough to pay for a few trips overseas ), 
  leaving aside the domestic shares , there 's an obvious gap : the us market . 
  you have veu but perhaps look at vts as well . 
  also , the ultimate decision is up to you , but you probably want to get the loan down below six figures before looking for an extra house . 
  no , that 's always hiding guy . 
  i 've never been unemployed in my life but i * still * know how sketchy job network providers are . 
  getting people jobs is * hard * . 
  it 's much easier to lie to centre link and applicants , and take credit for work they find themselves . 
  finally , a solution !, 
  retail fund if you 're young and new to investing . 
  wholesale fund if you 're willing to cede some margin for the automatic balancing and diversification . 
  etfs if you like more control and do n't mind diy balancing and choosing your own ratios . 
  note that balancing becomes a pain the more diverse your portfolio . 
  most people try to limit to four indexes or less . 
  aim to save 50 % of your net pay for a few months and see how it goes . 
  ramping up to 66 % is the dream , at the cost of quite a lot of penny pinching . 
  must be able to mix up academy awards envelopes . 
  sounds like foreign students are * subsidizing * domestic students . 
  the real problem is lack of federal funding , and uncapped numbers for degrees . 
  if you can get 100k together , the wholesale funds are much cheaper than retail . 
  from what i 've seen , the major reason you call in a big company is when you need a few hundred bodies to do a large project , and you do n't really care about cost or quality because it 's not * your * money . 
  the quality has really slipped . 
  it seems a common strategy is to hop on while the project is in its early stages , ride the wave to a promotion , then get out before it all crashes . 
  career surfing . 
   you 're not gaining card advantage w / baral 's ability , so over time , baral will be less and less relevant . 
  well , you do get to filter out dead cards from your hand , so there 's that . 
  late game , most lands become dead cards so you have more targets rather than fewer . 
  no , but if someone gets investigated for bad electrical work on airtasker , do n't you think it 's reasonable to email anyone who has previously used them for electrical work , just as a precaution ? 
  i mean , it would suck if your house burnt down because of this guy and the department * could * have given you a heads-up . 
  i see it a lot in it . 
  the bottom end of the market is very hard to break into , because graduates are competing with offshore developers who have a lot more experience for the same salary . 
  you can not compete with someone who is willing to do the job from another country for a $ 20k salary . 
  do n't try . 
  what you need to do is ** differentiate yourself ** , both from those in other countries , and from the other graduates in your cohort . 
  this means, 
  * proven comprehension and communication skills , both in general , and specifically within your chosen industry . 
  grads who do not know common terminology of their own industry just are n't trying , and this will count against them in interviews . 
  and for christ 's sake , proofread your resume or linkedin or whatever you use . 
  * evidence that you give a shit about your career . 
  in the it industry , this means being visible by creating your own projects on github , or answering questions on stackoverflow or whatever . 
  for other industries , it might mean attending relevant meetups or joining societies or publishing journals or putting mix tapes out . 
  whatever it is , show that you do things . 
  * network like you 're hungry for it . 
  attend meetups , go to to free events , shake hands , find out who 's who . 
  you 're looking for companies you did n't know existed , and niches you did n't know could be filled . 
  people from other countries do n't have the ability to do this , so if * you * do n't do it , stop complaining about them . 
  * be prepared to move . 
  i spent 4 + months in brisbane trying to get a job after graduating . 
  moved to sydney and got a job within 3 days . 
  do what you got ta do . 
  it is perfectly okay to midas a lane creep for the gold . 
  idk i think if you do n't go butterfly after manta , then there 's a reason , and that reason usually is that need ehp vs magic , so moon shard is not ideal - you 're better off getting most of the way towards a skadi and pick up moon shard later . 
  it 's still a pretty decent +34 damage for strength heroes . 
  i mean , that 's more than s&y . 
  tldr :, 
   * no context was provided , leaving the viewers to interpret the video themselves . 
  * the video included a lot of women who looked like they were n't aware they were being filmed . 
  * having a video focusing specifically on women in the crowd ** without that context ** reinforces toxic stereotypes about women , making it more difficult for us to be a part of this community . 
  - `` women are attention-seeking '' ,, 
  - `` women are special rare unicorns to be put on a pedestal/focused on as unique fans '' ,, 
  - `` women expect/deserve special treatment '' , etc. 
   the bottom line is that literally every single woman i 've talked to in the dota community deals with some kind of discrimination and just wants to be treated like a normal fan . 
  this is n't one of her best , true . 
  what 's a faptop ? 
  on second thought , do n't answer . 
  guzman is opening stores , google the locations and see if there 's job ads . 
  unsubscribe, 
  okay , a few things that come to mind,
