  * ` e-sports ' is a more fragmented view base than sports . 
  - there 's not a lot of overlap between games, 
  - there are more games in total, 
  - the games change between years, 
  * small player base x small population of australia = games not worth watching . 
  - competition from twitch or other tournaments is going to be fierce, 
  - especially since you can watch streams you missed , and do n't have to be * in * a stadium, 
  * the overlap between afl and say , dota , is close to 0 . 
  the brand is worthless . 
  it 's more realistic to have a red bull team or a lynx team than a dockers team . 
  * seriously , the entire thing is just / r/fellowkids material, 
  if etihad stadium wants bums in seats , then it should talk to existing e-sports orgs and get them to host worldwide events there , with the regularity of concerts instead of weekly matches . 
  i mean , there 's no problem [ filling up seats ] ( https://youtu.be/rwzqjqr-hbq ) for those things . 
  you might find this article interesting,

  even if it broke even , it 's still worth it because * fuck tax cheats * . 
  well , france is kinda like that . 
  i have no idea what your comment means . 
  suncorp and racq head offices are in brisbane . 
  there 's others as well . 
  i 'm unconvinced . 
  the football league model might work for some games , but i think most of them will follow the tennis model . 
  does cmc do international trades ? 
  or do you do something tricky with cfd instead ? 
  the engineering sector has the right idea . 
  all engineering students need at least [ 60 days experience ] ( https://www.eait.uq.edu.au/engineering-professional-practice ) in an engineering environment . 
  businesses pay them [ a percentage ] ( http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/support/rights-wages-conditions/pay-work-experience/ ) of the going rate of a graduate engineer . 
  in return , they get grads who have at least a clue . 
  peak wage is usually around age 40 . 
  things get quite unstable after that . 
  tldr :, 
  * competing on price with amazon enters a company into an ` automated ' pricing death spiral that amazon will always win . 
  * retailers need to focus on specialty brands that do n't want their product on amazon and are therefore unattainable there for consumers . 
  * retailers need to build consumer trust and/or be hyper focused on local markets . 
  offering in-store pick up and advice is something amazon can not do well . 
  - dicks sporting goods provides expert advice on sporting equipment that needs customization like golf clubs that need shortening or bicycles that need fitting or archery equipment that requires stringing . 
  - dicks also deals with heavy and bulky items that amazon does n't want to ship such as gun safes and canoes . 
  * for australian retailers like harvey norman , jb hi-fi , target , big w and k-mart -- which derive a large portion of revenue from undifferentiated consumables that can be bundled into small packages and shipped quickly -- amazon represents a cloud service of the dark and stormy kind . 
  lots of people dead-end during their 40s . 
  we ca n't * all * be senior managers ; that 's not how management layers work .

  unless the enemy antimage has an aghs .

  price match against a multibillion dollar corporation with geniuses on staff writing the pricing algorithms ? 
  nyx ghost scepters himself, 
  nyx activates carapace, 
  nyx dagons am, 
  am blocks and recasts the dagon , and adds 40 %, 
  nyx reflects the dagon , doubles it , and makes it pure, 
  am takes 2.8 dagons to the face ( 2240 pure with a dagon 5 ) . 
  it should also work vs lotus orb . 
  well they managed it in the philippines so there 's at least a chance here . 
  i have a happy life ; i just like to bitch . 
  i do n't know whether that triggers with carapace . 
  i 'd bet not . 
  no , he means robert jordan,

  note : ahca reinstates the ` pre-existing conditions ' clause whether the state joins the aca exchanges * or not * . 
  this is a really big deal for someone who has a pre-existing condition , like childhood asthma , ever broke a bone , got in a car accident , had a c-section , [ got raped ] ( http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/05/under-new-healthcare-bill-rape-is-a-pre-existing-condition.html ) etc. 
  the majority of times i have encountered that word has been people insinuating that the other person is bad at money management . 
  so , either there are a * lot * more jews than i thought who post in far right subreddits , or they 're people who like to perpetuate anti semitic stereotypes while insulting someone . 
  nope, 
  not really . 
  * they get to insult someone, 
  * that person thinks they 're being insulted by a jew, 
  * that person might start to dislike jews, 
  * the cycle of racism continues, 
  ugh joint accounts are a massive pain in the arse , joint shares doubly so . 
  overseas markets and fixed interest . 
  or overseas fixed interest if you 're serious about capital stability . 
  like vts ? 
  they are not exposed . 
  neither is vif or vgs etc. 
  you do have currency risk , but that 's swings and roundabouts and not worth hedging imo . 
  the aud is medium to high strength vs the usd so there 's that . 
  there 's little difference between a us domiciled fund like vts , and an australian fund that * invests * internationally , like vgs . 
  either way , their income is from overseas . 
  that 's fine . 
  the idea is not to get fanatical about one particular market . 
  i mean , even if you 're correct by ditching the asx , at some stage it * will * be time to pick up domestic stocks again . 
  note that security experts recommend not using poli . 
  it 's pretty sketchy , even though it 's owned by australia post now . 
  high interest savings accounts are decent replacements anyway . 
  have you tried pine and bamboo on wynnum road ? 
  idk, 
  i 'm pretty sure they are n't . 
  mate , you must expect menu items like that on the english menu . 
  more to the point , it 's important to give credit where credit is due , instead of sagging off an entire political party . 
  going down that road ends up looking like the us , where the republicans and democrats ca n't even agree on what 's a fact and what is n't .
