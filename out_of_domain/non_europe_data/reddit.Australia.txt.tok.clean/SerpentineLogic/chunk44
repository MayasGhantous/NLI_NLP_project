  ** recommended skills : **, 
  this recommended skill plan should take approximately two weeks to complete . 
  the vexor can be piloted earlier to get into level 2 missions , after about one week , depending on how the character was skilled and the player 's ability to pilot the ship effectively using proper kiting techniques in difficult missions .

  ** notes **, 
  * the example fitting has drones and hardeners fitted for serpentis rats . 
  * drones iv is the minimum amount of drones recommended to start running level 2 missions in a vexor . 
  * this fit uses a large battery instead of a second cap recharger ; with cruiser fits that are not cap stable , the large battery adds a significant amount to capacitor duration for low skill point pilots . 
  took me a week or so for mine to arrive . 
  ah , he must have followed the guy to low-sec . 
  i have lots of stuff stashed away in my [ newbie guide post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) . 
  it depends on what you 'll be using it for . 
  missile boats are fine in small gang pvp , but they get worse as, 
  the range increases , since waiting 20 seconds for your missiles blows, 
  the size of the fleet increases , since ships are much more likely to pop when shot at by 150 guys instead of 5 , no matter what range . 
  thousands of people use missiles every day in pvp - you just have to know their limitations . 
  as far as caracal fits go , ask [ on failheap ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?1034-caracal ) . 
  offer to sell it back to them . 
  after all , you 'd rather have isk than blueprints and minerals ... 
  planetary interaction . 
  i believe invictra [ started a blog ] ( http://invictra.blogspot.com ) dedicated to it a few weeks ago . 
  oh , i do n't know . 
  i was ratting and doing radar sites in lowsec within a month of starting playing . 
  being able to drop into a belt and find 2.5 m isk worth of rats just sitting there ready to be killed is a lot better return than high-sec . 
  i did lose a lot of ships , but i still made bank . 
  this . 
  proteus is great for heavy tackling , hot-drop baiting and cloaky buttsexing , but it is not great for pve . 
  here 's some [ combat guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) i prepared a while back . 
  upon reflection , ccp could benefit from stealing some ideas from other mmos as far as crowd control and buffs go . 
  think about it . 
  we already have buffs and debuffs and area effects :, 
  * tracking links, 
  * ewar, 
  * smartbombs, 
  but there 's a lot of room to innovate . 
  what if there were long-cycling reppers that actually rep you over your maximum hp to stop the target from being alpha 'd ? 
  the extra hp would degrade over time . 
  what if there were area effect webs ? 
  or if command ships gave extra fleet bonuses if you were within range of its ` aura ' ? 
  other mmos may be lame in general , but there are so many neat effects that you could steal from guild wars or rift or whatever that could easily adapt to eve . 
  oh , you 'd rather dreddit just sit on that isk like a < racial slur  ? 
  your * mains * are the spies . 
  then claim you never got it and they should send it again . 
  `` must be level 80 '' . 
  you do know that the usa used this ` trick ' in the years following independence , right ? 
  the states were a * massive * source of copyright-infringing books that got shipped to the uk . 
  japan did it , korea did it , taiwan , china ; it 's a common tactic to get a short-cut to an industralised nation . 
  have cheap labor but stable political system, 
  get foreign companies to invest in local factories, 
  sell cheap mass-produced stuff, 
  get enough know-how to move up the value chain . 
  infringe copyright and make cheap knock-offs and compete on price, 
  pivot into actual high-quality goods once you have the expertise, 
  eat everyone else 's lunch, 
  tests for hiv are less reliable if you 've contracted hiv very recently . 
  that 's why australia deferrs blood donations until 12 months after . 
  ( even then , it seems like a long time , but just like people do n't obey the speed limit , they 'll also lie a bit about the 12 month thing ), 
  in other news , four new zealand families discovered to possess genes only found in sheep . 
  i assume this is the same sort of photoshopping that turns a regular photo into [ something like this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:oregon_state_beavers_tilt-shift_miniature_greg_keene.jpg ) ? 
  * destroying an abaddon fitted with tech 2 mods : gained lp = ( 196m isk & ndash ; 161m isk + 46m isk + 0 ) / 10000 = ** 8100 ** lp ( previous system would have paid ** 500 ** lp ), 
  * destroying a machariel fitted with tech 2 mods : gained lp = ( 1.170 m isk & ndash ; 95m isk + 40m isk + 0 ) / 10000 = ** 111500 ** lp ( previous system would have paid ** 750 ** lp ),
