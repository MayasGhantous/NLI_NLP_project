  people overestimate how long it takes products to fundamentally change a market . 
  / s ing so hard right now, 
  value point is good when laning against anti mage . 
  ten years ago , rockets that fly back to base and land themselves upright were a pipe dream ... 
  pretty much all contracts are in usd , although there 's a lot more spot pricing than there used to be . 
  rio and bhp are n't really concerned by low iron ore prices . 
  they 'll just continue to produce , and if that sends more expensive miners out of business , awesome . 
  remember that rio has * waste spoil * reserves with higher iron content than some recently opened working mines . 
  their cost base is tiny in comparison . 
  baby steps, 
  humans gon na do human things, 
  of all the crazy things i 've seen from the fringe posters , this is the most coherent . 
  ` family ' visas are a common thing the world over , but traditionally , australia did n't do them ever since i started paying attention ( the howard years ) . 
  the us is big on it , but not here . 
  for a migrant with family , yes it was shit but tough biscuits . 
  not sure why this policy has changed , since the liberal party is n't really known for being super compassionate . 
   rio and bhp are somewhere are $ 37 - $ 35 / tonne . 
  i 've heard much lower numbers from people who work there ( in the 20s ), 
  if you prefer , set up solo queue only in your game options . 
  actually the deal is the first 18 months of payments go to the company employing the chuggers . 
  only after that does the charity get any money . 
  just say `` i have a boyfriend '', 
  it 's not a job . 
  it 's exploitation . 
  both the charity and the chuggers are being exploited , so i have no interest in perpetuating it . 
  search this subreddit for appco and cobra group , there 's lots of discussion about how shitty they are . 
   `` consumers were lead to believe that these e-cigarettes did n't contain toxins or anything dangerous when in fact they contained things like formaldehyde and acrolein , which are known carcinogens , '' australian competition and consumer commission ( accc ) acting chair delia rickard said . 
  they deserved those fines , then . 
  edit : note that they 're still selling that stuff , it just has a disclaimer . 
  on the cheap end , but i 'll allow it . 
  australia also hand-counts its electoral ballots . 
  why ? 
  because the number of suspicious pensioners scales precisely up or down with population , and they 're happy to spend an evening doing something social in return for tea and biscuits . 
  looks like the management costs are reasonable : 0.25 %, 
  so if you had e.g. 
  50k to invest domestically :, 
  * 100 % vas : $ 70/year, 
  * 50/50 : $ 97.50 / year, 
  * 100 % ex20 : $ 125/year, 
  considering that you 'd expect something like $ 3000 returns on that 50k , the difference in fees is not a huge bump . 
  would you go all-out and get shadow blade instead , so you can initiate even when there 's veno wards littering the map ? 
  i recommend taking him to a doctor for an actual medical opinion . 
  make auto grates again . 
  idk , i have n't tried . 
  i mean , i do n't even know where he lives . 
  there 's only 300k people in the entire country . 
  their fair share would be approximately $ 10.80, 
  changing numbers between countries ? 
  25 % down to 10 % is a big jump though ; you 'd need 2.5 x the portfolio if you did n't sell any . 
  i do n't know who to cheer for . 
  is it possible that they * both * lose ? 
  i 'm in the middle of transitioning away from amp . 
  the performance is good but the fees are fucking shithouse . 
  seconding `` lazy uncle 's guide '' . 
  icr of 0.68 %, 
  management fee of 0.22 % pa + $ 8.25 / month, 
  that seems pretty high to me . 
  that 's $ 99 base + another $ 900 for each $ 100k in super . 
  denying ( or attempting to deny ) creeps * does n't use refraction charges * , so you can chip away at the enemy mid for free using the psi blades spash damage . 
  this is super important in lane . 
  magic sticks, 
  well now he 'll be in both . 
  well , for $ 18 i 'd expect something like, 
   tomato , whipped feta & avocado, 
  with black pepper & olive oil on toasted sourdough, 
  tldr : this would be a relatively normal budget if labor were in power , which a surprising shift left for the liberals . 
  another trick is to ward * behind * the tower you want to push . 
  your teammates will be a lot more confident if they can see enemies teleporting in , so they have time to back . 
  another thing you can do is bring cheap healing like urn , salves , a stack of tangos etc , so the cores do n't need to back after a fight . 
  re medicare levy : it pays for ndis . 
  labor would do exactly the same thing in their position . 
  re uni fee hikes : maybe a labor left government like gillard would not have done this , but the labor right totally would , if they needed the money and could spin it . 
  i have a ` group up ! ', 
  if someone does n't follow your suggestions , there 's not much you can do about that . 
  i 've lost games because of not pushing ; i have also won games that i had no right to , because the enemy team made that same mistake . 
  there 's a time limit though ? 
  note that the 30k or 25k cap ** includes ** compulsory super , so that cuts a big chunk out of the cap . 
  the home deposit thing only works for non-compulsory super contributions , and i * do n't * think it 's retrospective . 
  those videos are top notch, 
  redraw is like a restricted offset account : you put money in , but taking it out has limits , or costs you , or whatever . 
  offset accounts are great if you have large sums of money going in and out , but if your finances are more predictable , redraw facilities are not too bad to work around . 
  assuming this means you have to keep an extra $ 2000 in a transaction account to pay bills instead of putting into the loan , this will cost you an extra ~ $ 100/year in interest . 
  still grumpy in moana . 
  there 's also a [ sequel movie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/what_becomes_of_the_broken_hearted%3f_\\ ( film \\ ) ) , and a [ third book ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jake%27s_long_shadow ) . 
  not that i know of , but i 'm not an expert . 
  there * might * be something obscure about how they 're treated for whether the money comes off the principal or what . 
  i do this all the time when my carry farms too deep, 
  ok , so what about other big banks ? 
  tbh i 'd open a separate bank account for your business . 
  much easier to keep a track of things using pocketbook or whatever . 
  at my mmr , they 're valuable itemisation suggestions . 
  confirming . 
  once you have enough duel damage that you will kill someone without blademail , then you start looking at survivability . 
  assuming you already have a bkb or whatever , something like satanic , abyssal or halberd will let you come out of a duel at full health , so you can keep killing . 
   how does it make any sense that they would side with coles to prevent an eba being scrutinised by fair work ? 
  history time :, 
  during the trade union movement , counter-unions sprung up , run by the catholic church , and founded on anti-communist principles . 
  most of them lost ; the sda is the only one that remains . 
  and that 's why it 's the way it is . 
  1 ) whichever city you want .
