  anecdotally , most people just top up the lower one ( s ) , until they get to the point where one gets so far out of whack that they ca n't afford to top up the others enough . 
  that 's when they take profits and redistribute it . 
  you 'll have to work out what your trigger point is . 
  i mean , if you say `` if things get 5 % out of whack i 'll sell '' , then you might sell too often . 
  if you choose 20 % , you might not sell enough , and the price might go back down before you had a chance to skim off some cash . 
  vanguard published a document where they modelled rebalancing at certain percentages . 
  i ca n't remember what the optimum value was , but i do recall that they said rebalancing at 5 % drift did n't do much except cost you . 
  they are known for spending shitloads on internal projects instead of taking profits and giving to shareholders .

  * consider [ using opendota ] ( https://www.opendota.com/matches/3194767959 ) instead of dotabuff for individual games ; it parses more things ( assuming a replay is available ), 
  * you did n't build any farming or damage items . 
  dusa is already relatively tanky , but you need one item to increase your farm before you get back on the tank plan . 
  maybe that 's a casual yasha , maybe maelstrom , maybe mask of madness ; just something to get accelerating . 
  i probably would have chosen maelstrom this game because of jugg , but idk . 
  * acorns is great to start with . 
  it 's an awesome way to dip your toes in . 
  * after a while , the fees from acorns stop being worth it ( probably 5-10k , maybe lower ) or the product mixes are a bit restrictive , and you start looking at other investment options . 
  * often , people get into proper managed funds at this point , since you can get exposure to a lot of market sectors without hassle , and you can still bpay $ 100 at a time into it without huge transaction costs . 
  * managed funds are a nice sweet spot until you get 25-75k , then you might want to do some more work yourself in return for better yield . 
  - imo this is the point where you start investing directly in the stock market . 
  so , you can invest directly at this point if you want , but it might be a bit premature . 
  you can tell because they did n't sprinkle white powder on the body afterwards, 
  counter ward by placing the sentry in the middle of the river , slightly away from roshan .

  south 32 , also known as `` the billiton parts '',

  the fund was specifically set up to invest in renewable energy projects , since its hard to get a bank loan for stuff like that . 
  ( so far the fund makes a profit every year ), 
  if a tried and tested coal project ca n't get normal funding , then, 
  * it 's out of the original remit of the fund , hence the legislation to expand it, 
  * there 's probably a good financial reason why banks and other institutions wo n't fund it * anyway *, 
  what if your license is old and does n't show you 're a donor ? 
  that 's what the other card is for . 
  makes it clear to hospital staff . 
  or they could look at the card that 's right next to your drivers license . 
  it 's low-tech , but until checking the database gets a lot faster and convenient to hospital staff ( i.e. 
  take a photo on your phone and upload it ) , then low-tech matters . 
  this question comes up so often it should go in the wiki or sidebar , tbh, 
  there 's a lot you can do yourself . 
  for each super fund , find out, 
  * what the management fees are ( or what they would be if you consolidated all your super into that fund ), 
  * what the returns have been over the last 1 , 3 , 5 years ( since low fees are good , but not if it * also * has low returns ), 
  * whether you 're signed up for life insurance from that fund , and what it covers and for how much . 
  note that having 2 companies both provide life insurance may be risky and one may not pay out due to legal clauses in their policies, 
  once you have that info :, 
  * you can work out which of your super funds is the best, 
  * you can then compare that one with others you find via research , web sites or whatever .

  ing savings maximiser will give you 3.00 % , as long as you transfer $ 1000/month into it ( i heard you can transfer some money back afterwards without problems ) . 
  so that 's one option . 
  guaranteed 3 % , basically zero chance you 'll lose money . 
  acorns has fees ( $ 1.25 / month = $ 15/year ) and you invest in a bunch of sectors instead of just one . 
  i 'll simplify and use the 3-year return on one of the larger funds acorns invests in , because fuck looking everything up . 
  stw.ax has a 5.65 % 3-year return . 
  so for $ 1000 , that 's an extra $ 26.50 per year in interest but - $ 15 for fees = $ 11.50 better . 
  so , unless you have $ 500 + in acorns , the fees will make it worse than a high interest savings account . 
  after that , it 's probably better , but there 's a risk of a bad month or year where you wo n't get 3 % , or you might go backwards . 
  that 's the stock market for you . 
  either option is fine to start out with . 
  try acorns if you want , then reassess how you feel this time next year . 
  or try the hisa route . 
  or do a mix if you want to have an each-way bet . 
  the important thing is that you * do * reassess your options every year or so , to make sure you 're on the right track .

  pretty sure banks are * a bit sensitive * to being dodgy . 
  bastards ? 
  sure , no problem , but dodgy ? 
  old people . 
  dumb people too , but mostly old people who are losing it a bit . 
  the type who panic and send money overseas when they see `` you '' on facebook saying you got arrested and need bail money . 
  the type who get cladding on their house twice a year because dodgy tradies know they 're forgetful and trusting . 
  the sort of people who lose everything to scammers and society has to pick up the slack .

  fair enough . 
  if acorns helps you with savings discipline , then do what works for you . 
  well that 's * one * way to guarantee that your lawyer 's an idiot . 
  * finder , infochoice , choice.com.au all have comparison sites . 
  historically , ing has been good because it 's not too hard to get the bonus rate , and the rate lasts for a long time ( some of the other rates are short-term and expire after 12 months or whatever ), 
  * that 's her choice , but she 'll need * some * part of her portfolio in growth investments to go along with the interest-bearing yield parts like bank accounts . 
  looking at the [ vanguard \\ ( wholesale \\ ) *** conservative *** index fund ] ( https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/funddetail/wholesale/portid=8132/ ) , it still has a target weighting of 30 % growth , 70 % income investments ( according to the fact sheet ), 
  ... and that 's the convervative one .
