  you guys should seriously upgrade . 
  well , existing loans will count against your borrowing limit . 
  that 's about the extent of it . 
  i find the whirlpool forums to be hit and miss . 
  there 's a lot of trolls and sketchy posters there . 
  therapy might be the correct approach . 
  100 % serious . 
  i would posit that maths would be more rigorous than engineering , given the different outlook on calculations . 
  engineering is more `` ok here 's a formula , there 's the background that we provide to you for you to understand , * not to prove it yourself * , now let 's apply that to useful situations to build things '', 
  about 75 % applicable for you . 
  15k free money is nice , but remember you have to borrow 20-50 times that amount to get it . 
  so , do your sums . 
  * pick a house or suburb . 
  * find out how much you 'd expect to pay per month to rent it, 
  * find out how much you 'd expect to buy it, 
  * then work out what the repayments would be on the loan you 'd need, 
  this gives you a baseline for ` rent vs buy ' . 
  it also lets you work out what your rental yield would be , as a percentage . 
  then you can compare that against the yield of a share portfolio . 
  phew, 
  not really . 
  it would be more like bounty crit . 
  justapose changed to trigger off buildings ? 
  suddenly pl pushes as hard as tb ... 
  some minor item changes could also boost him , e.g. 
  * orb of venom dot changed to just do +5 magic damage on hit, 
  * skadi changed to inherit the damage of orb of venom, 
  suddenly pl has an immediate bump at level 6 , and an * eventual * late-game option becomes more attractive , and you can still chip your way through damage block . 
  you can get open ended loans for shares . 
  this is actually fairly easy to work out . 
  you mentioned vanguard ? 
  well , there 's the vanguard lifestrategy \u00ae high growth fund , which is a one-stop shop for your high growth risk profile . 
  or , if you want to go a bit more diy , then you look at the [ fact sheet ] ( https://api.vanguard.com/rs/gre/gls/stable/documents/8298/au ) and discover that it 's composed of a bunch of vanguard wholesale funds , and the largest percentages are :, 
  * vanguard [ australian ] ( https://api.vanguard.com/rs/gre/gls/stable/documents/7640/au ) shares index fund ( wholesale ) @ 40 %, 
  * vanguard [ international ] ( https://api.vanguard.com/rs/gre/gls/stable/documents/7707/au ) shares index fund ( wholesale ) @ 31 %, 
  so you go into their fact sheets and discover that those funds track one index each :, 
  * s&p / asx 300 index, 
  and each of those indexes has a corresponding etf which you should have no problems finding . 
  depending on how far you want to go , you can replicate other holdings inside the high growth fund ad nauseam . 
  yeast is a culture . 
  it gives us beer , and then we turn the dregs into vegemite . 
  * reported *, 
  unless your situation changes , you 're quite a few years away from having a safe house deposit . 
  this gives you the opportunity to invest what you have * right now * , then build back your cash reserves between now and the time you want to buy . 
  i suggest looking into markets and indexes that are not really affected by the aussie housing market , so international indexes etc. 
  that way , you have less risk of your investments being pulled down by a housing crash . 
   1 . am i putting too much into my super which i ca n't access until i 'm 60 ? 
  it 's not a terrible idea , especially at your tax bracket . 
  i mean , you can it down if you need the money for something else . 
   2 . i have no exposure to fixed interest assets . 
  should i have it in my portfolio ? 
  my understanding is bonds are unattractive at this time . 
  well , the rams thing is actually a chunk of cash-based yield ; it 's just not in a formal investment vehicle , which is fine . 
   3 . if i buy into etfs with the $ 30k managed fund sold . 
  vge is my best performer so i 'm tempted to buy more however the re-balancing investment strategy suggest i shouldnt ' . 
  should i buy more vge or stick to my etf or total portfolio allocation ? 
  just because you have good years does not mean you should change your ratio . 
  look at various funds ( like the vanguard retail funds ) and see what their target range is for emerging markets - you 'll find they 're all fairly low , and ofc if they stray outside of a certain band , then the funds will sell them off to capitalise on the paper gains . 
   4 . i 'm due for an additional tax payment this year . 
  what type of investment should i consider to be more tax effective ? 
  some people like insurance bonds . 
  i find them only kinda ok . that does n't help you this year though . 
  maybe look at tax deductions instead ( laptops etc ), 
   5 . the idea of buying an investment property is embedded in my head but the thought of servicing a loan on my own scares me off it . 
  are there any benefits like tax in going down this path ? 
  ( i 'll add the family home is not under my name as husband bought it before we got married so i think i may still be considered as first home buyer . ), 
  well , you seem to have a handle on the stock market , so remember you can get a loan to buy shares . 
  and the benefit is that you get a lot more flexibility on how much money you need to borrow - it 's more like a line of credit . 
  well , if you already have vgs , why not add to it instead of vts + veu split ? 
  that just adds more work when you rebalance . 
  yeah , but veu has that bad tax situation , which cuts into its returns . 
  i prefer vgs + vge, 
  tldr :, 
  veu has income that 's foreign to both the us and australia , and thus pays tax on that money to whichever european countries it earned it in . 
  reciprocal tax arrangements are n't transitive , so while us investors get a tax break on those euro taxes , australians can not . 
  this means we lose -0.197 % yield on veu compared to the yanks . 
  we * can * , however , get the tax breaks if the fund was domiciled in australia , like vgs is . 
  so a 50/50 vts/veu split ends up being about the same cost ratio as vgs anyway when you factor in the losses . 
  if you plan to sell the shares eventually , you might want to get the cash , and roll it into the next purchase or rebalance , just because the tax accounting is a lot easier . 
  if you do n't plan to sell the shares , or do n't plan to add to your investment manually , then drp is quite convenient . 
  or if you have something like sharesight , you get the tax stuff done automatically so maybe that 's the best of both worlds . 
  but he 's a rampant trump supporter . 
  i 'm starting to think this whole trump thing might be a bad idea . 
  ok , so maybe get a second bank account ( a high interest one ) and set up an automated transfer of half your income each pay period . 
  that will guarantee your saving rate . 
  ideally you 'll have a decent amount of money left over at the end of each month , but it will help with working out whether you can afford the big-but-rare purchases . 
  tb has absurdly high armor . 
  plus , his q slows you , his w will spawn illusions that you are in range to be hit with , and then he can press e and hit you while you approach or disengage . 
  no ; he 's just the team captain who drops the ball a lot . 
  way to bring up the opium wars , guy . 
  sometimes there is . 
  od needs attack speed and his orb does not crit , so orchid into thorn is optimal . 
  bkb will be a problem regardless , so go with the one with the most utility . 
  wr does not care about attack speed so much , so either one is good . 
  lina has a problem with bkb so i can understand why she gets crits . 
  aw yeah , * that 's it * . 
  making love for * two *, 
  yeah we had a bit of a derp but i think we 'll trend back towards the centre in the next election .
