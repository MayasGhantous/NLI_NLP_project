  * destroying a providence with 1 b full of cargo : gained lp = ( 1115m isk & ndash ; 839m isk + 0 + 1000m isk ) / 10000 = ** 127600 ** lp ( previous system would have paid ** 2000 ** lp ), 
  * destroying a punisher with tech 1 fitting : gained lp = ( 450k isk & ndash ; 312k isk + 100k isk + 0 ) / 10000 = around ** 24 ** lp ( previous system would have paid ** 25 ** lp ), 
  * destroying a punisher with tech 2 fitting : gained lp = ( 450k isk & ndash ; 312k isk + 7.8 m isk +0 ) / 10000 = around ** 794 ** lp ( previous system would have paid ** 25 ** lp ), 
  [ original link ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;nbid=28659 ), 
  correct , but the lp rewards may be split amongst your fleet . 
  try not to mix industry and combat skills ( beyond the low level skills required for the tutorial agents ) . 
  there really is n't a lot of overlap so it 's best to make separate characters for each . 
  it 's not bad ; it 's just a waste . 
  there are literally a dozen rank 1 skills more important to train than this , and double that if you count harder skills . 
  imo core competency standard is a good cert to aim for except for this skill . 
  best to do it as part of another corp ( or arrange for temporary non-aggression pact and go on some roams with them to establish your cred ) . 
  a semi-serious alliance like [ taboo ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/t_a_b_o_o/corporations ) would probably be a better fit for you than some of the serious business pvp outfits .

  read a [ summary of recent patches ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) and decide for yourself . 
  judging by recent trailers , it 's more of a wubsite . 
  did [ someone say links ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) ? 
  do you do forum banners ? 
  people love those . 
  that 's a hell of an immigration law . 
   at last count , i believe the time required to train every possible skill to level five was about nine years . 
  closer to 20 , actually . 
  got examples of your work ? 
  eve : causality trailer . 
  some of the videos that inspired me to join :, 
  * [ causality ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugplrpwvz0i ), 
  * [ butterfly effect ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq2oxt7nrxo ), 
  * [ dominion ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdvehe10nhc ), 
  * also , i do like the [ more ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai4vko6qr0u ) [ recent ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osxsyv4lc1c ) [ ones ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrvdv_nsno ), 
  * the game developers even have a [ rock band ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgvm7av1o1q ) . 
  basically , just go on ccp games ' youtube channel and be convinced . 
  you do know how big a dreadnought cargo bay is ? 
  guild wars is more like counter strike than say , wow . 
  it has instant action and wins and losses have less impact on your character . 
  the eve equivalent would actually be dust 514 which is in beta . 
  i went through four trials before i subscribed heh . 
  one reason is that , in a massively * multiplayer * game , they 're the ones that login and do n't interact with anyone ( because they 're in a one-man corporation to avoid corp taxes ) and basically amass isk that they do n't use . 
  another is that in a game that involves spaceships exploding , not only do they not want to participate in a fight , they ca n't even accept that someone should be able to drag them into a fight . 
  they rail against suicide ganks and insist that high-sec should be safer , but do n't want to give up any of the massive advantages that high-sec confers to them . 
  most players are perfectly ok with people running missions or mining or whatever floats their boat , as long as they are involved in the eve community , acknowledge that other players who like to pvp are n't raging psychos , and accept that other players have the right to interact with them ( with guns ) without their consent . 
  intrepid crossing . 
  it would be good to tell which alliances are close friends , by mutual blue and red lists ... 
  there 's valid points to be made on all sides of the argument . 
  personally , i do n't mind much if people spend all day shooting red plus signs just to see a number in their wallet increase . 
  they paid their subscription fee , they can do what they like . 
  however , i do take issue when those players attempt to decrease the options to interact with them . 
  it 's a sandbox mmo , which * relies * on player interaction . 
  if they want not to be bothered by other people , they should be playing ~ ~ solitaire ~ ~ x3 instead . 
  if you include forum wars , then it definitely does . 
  not really . 
  three retired and were replaced by new members ( with the same colours ), 
  depends what you 're interested in doing . 
  however , might i suggest fweddit corp , since new faction warfare rules come into effect on tuesday , so you can get in on the ground floor . 
  well , you can cut out some skills by using , e.g. 
  faction or meta-level shield boosters and adjusting the subsystems ( by dropping to a 5-launcher set-up , you can even fit a cap-stable large shield booster , which will make your tengu practically unkillable in pve ), 
  overheat everything , kill the frigates with precision ( or faction ) missiles . 
  * [ hurricane , basic pve ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/minmatar_basic_ship_and_skill_guide#hurricane.2c_basic_pve ) ( designed for medium-long range combat ), 
   i 've never seen the word tenement outside of a history book . 
  last time i saw it was on * [ the crow ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_crow_%28soundtrack%29 ) * soundtrack . 
  solution : lump * all * north americans together . 
  it 's a mining frigate . 
  i have one left over from the tutorial missions and it 's actually a pretty neat-looking ship ( widdershins must have his graphics options turned way down ), 
  hint : they succeeded, 
  i 'm not sure it works that way . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  some [ \\ ( combat-related \\ ) guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) you may have missed . 
  phoenixes have incredibly high alpha btw . 
  it 's just a pain to web and paint the target down enough , for * long * enough until the torps hit . 
  the buddy system allows existing eve players to send an email to other people , inviting them to a 21-day trial instead of the standard 14-day one . 
  if that person subscribes to eve after the trial , the sender receives a [ plex ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/30_days_concord_pilot_license_extension ) , which can be redeemed for 30 days playing time , or sold on the market for isk . 
  the 50/50 split refers to selling the plex on the market , and splitting the proceeds . 
  checking the [ market ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=29668&amp;usesystem=30000142 ) , a 50 % split will net you about 240 million isk - that 's a fair amount of isk for a new player - enough for some +3 implants and a few decent ships , or seed capital for a fledgling industrialist .

  frigate : merlin ( small hybrid turrets ),
