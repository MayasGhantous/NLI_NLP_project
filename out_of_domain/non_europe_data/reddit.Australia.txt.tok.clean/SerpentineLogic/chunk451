  it does n't have to be for your entire salary but if the shit hits the fan medically and you ca n't work , but you do n't die , you will appreciate it . 
  is that code short for cello/bass baggage ? 
  i do n't think there are any changes to the levy due until 2019 .

  ok cool . 
  it 's way more important in single income households . 
  this is the correct way to approach anything sketchy . 
  yeah but once it 's set up you do n't need to do anything further . 
  cmc will send them the details when the trade settles . 
  advantages and disadvantages . 
  inside super , you get a good tax break , and you get to use your super money now instead of waiting until you retire . 
  outside super , it 's tax-deductible anyway , and there 's a more competitive market , so you can usually get a cheaper price , or options that inside-super ipi ca n't do ( because the new features were thought up after the laws were laid down ), 
  no , it 's frasier . 
   and we have a well-educated workforce, 
  yeah , but we no longer have the experience . 
  it 's the same thing we saw in japan , then taiwan and korea , and now china :, 
  * make shit plastic products for cheap , in half-arsed factories , because that 's the only way they can compete, 
  * make decent but not durable products for cheap , in better factories, 
  * make complicated stuff in high-tech factories at fuck-off-insane levels of scale , because they have the expertise, 
  people forget that the reverse is also true : a country 's expertise can drop if it 's not used ( see : rockets to the moon ), 
  and garlic . 
  holy shit you can smell it coming out of your sweat, 
  ... which eat chemicals your sweat ducts produce . 
  and people with this particular gene expression produce less of a certain chemical that smelly bacteria eat . 
  the problem with a society where 95 % of people genetically do n't stink , is that the 5 % who do have no idea how to fix it , and no easy access to deodorants . 
  you do you , man . 
  just realise that for the majority of westerners , deodorant is * not * an optional thing . 
  imo that 's a failure in their secondary education as well as their tertiary ; if they 'd been tempered with an appropriately scaled set of challenges , they would n't break under the steep learning curve of university . 
   when you praise kids for their intelligence , they learn to view their failures as evidence of stupidity, 
  the article provides sources . 
  36k steps ? 
  that 's like 9 hours of walking . 
  the build up is a bit easier on atos, 
   the anime despawn, 
  the horror !, 
  it does n't work any more . 
  the strategy was `` i know i 'll lose mid , but i will prevent him from snowballing and threaten his tower so he ca n't leave the lane without being punished '' . 
  winning atm, 
   but even assuming you are 1k mmr , you will most likely still calibrate at 3.5 k.

  we have amazon in the same way iceland has amazon . 
  we can order things online and they 're put on a boat and transported from the uk . 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but sometimes children have to help their parents ; it 's not a one-way thing . 
  ideology of the current federal government ( conservative ) :, 
   `` climate change is n't real . 
  coal is the future '', 
  ideology of the current state government ( liberal * ish * ) :, 
   `` jobs are more important than the reef . 
  they just happen to be coal jobs . '', 
  i think that 's a misrepresentation of the political situation . 
  we 're on a swing back from some seriously weird administrations , both at federal and state level . 
  federally , we 've gone from a serious religious nutcase ( abbott ) like that guy in the us who looks like a turtle , to someone who 's conservative-but-not-crazy-but-just-has-bad-ideas ( turnbull ) like romney . 
  on a state level , we 've gone from a berlusconi ( newman ) to a clinton ( palaszczuk ) , so while we 're unhappy with the politicians in office , we 're just taking a pause at what we 've achieved , before taking on the next hill of policies . 
  how does he keep his mana up without a bottle ? 
  play carry as unranked , get your stats up , then go back to ranked with your valve-certified carry stat block ? 
  nobody can prove it in public yet , but he * did * sell a lot of real estate to russian companies for very high prices , so the question is still open . 
  colour me unsurprised . 
  this is why people change jobs every couple of years . 
   what would be the ideal circumstances to start investing properly ? 
  acorns * is * properly . 
  a bank account earning interest * is * properly . 
  ... in moderation . 
  acorns is fine for amounts up to $ 5-10k . 
  when you start hitting those thresholds , it 's time to take the next step , but until then , educating yourself is more important than jumping in too early . 
  stacked charts pls, 
  how appropriate ; you fight like a whale . 
  if you 're melee , pretty-much always get it vs weaver . 
  * you 'll be taking harass damage , possibly at twice the rate due to geminate attack, 
  * the swarm is blocked by pms . 
  you 'll still have to kill the bugs to remove the debuff , but at least you 're not taking increasing amounts of damage at the same time, 
  but seat belts fitted to golf carts at least give the option of choosing safety . 
  well , part of the requirements for a seat belt that works is not having the seat assembly come out in an accident . 
  i seal what you did there, 
  bangladesh state forest ? 
  that graph is not a problem because the y axis starts at 0 . 
  high interest savings account . 
  after all , you want zero chance of it dropping in value when you come back in a year and start looking at property , and you are n't going to get a capital gains discount for shares . 
  * effort ( especially if you 're overseas and not trusting ), 
  * culture ( some cultures really look down on second-hand things , including apartments for some reason - important if you bought a flat for your kids in anticipation of them going there for university ), 
  i do n't see any situation where it would be worth including . 
  if they get karn first , you 'll never be able to cast it , so you 're better off with [ [ maelstrom pulse ] ] . 
  if you * do * have 5gb available and no karn , you 'd rather have a [ [ world breaker ] ] . 
  well , he * was * just following orders . 
  or for that personal touch, 
  i do n't think there 's space in a g/x deck for this . 
  * maybe * g/desert tron, 
  i think they fucked with per-hero bindings . 
  check them in client - they might have reset everything to non-quick cast . 
  for minimum investment , it works out at ** 1.84 ** % fees, 
  for 50k , it 's 0 . 
  ** 71 ** 5 % fees . 
  it better have fucking good returns to beat acorns ( 0 . 
  ** 27 ** 5 % fees ), 
  ouch . 
  does clover have fund fees ? 
  usd800k is objectively a lot , but it * also * has 4x the buying power in a country like the philippines . 
  so , acorns is still cheaper , even if the clover fees are inclusive of fund fees ?
