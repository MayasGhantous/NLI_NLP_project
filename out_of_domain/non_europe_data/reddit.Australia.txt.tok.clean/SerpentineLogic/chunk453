  in situations like this , you 're not competing on pure skill , which especially problematic for grads who , by * necessity * , position themselves based more on their potential than their existing competency . 
  skilled immigration is not the problem ; in fact , skilled migration would be a fine * solution * to the market-distorting effects of the 457 visa program . 
  you probably saw a landing of the first stage . 
  the capsule we 're talking about is the third stage , and does n't have big enough rocket engines or enough fuel left to land like that . 
  which reminds me - what 's the date when super companies have to report downstream fees ? 
  i mean , hostplus indexed balanced has 0.02 % fees , but nobody knows what the underlying fees of the funds are ... 
  my thoughts :, 
  * vgs already covers the entire developed world . 
  adding veu is probably a mistake . 
  i could see it if you went v *** t *** s + veu , but even then it 's double the trades for some * really * tiny benefits . 
  * as sloppyrock said , do n't buy etfs in chunks as small as $ 1k . 
  wait until your portfolio is bigger . 
  after all , you are correct that your super is probably 50 % australian shares anyway . 
  given all that , it might be a lot less hassle to buy 10k in vgs , maybe set dividend reinvestment up if that 's what you want , then add to it every 6 months or so for a while . 
  yeah , although depending on the ratios you chose ( 10 % domestic , 90 % international ) , you 'll probably be topping up vgs every 6 months regardless . 
  if you choose cmc as a stockbroker , it comes with a linked sharesight account ( and cmc will send trades to your account etc ) . 
  if you choose another broker , you 'll probably have to set up the link manually somehow . 
  if you 've * already * bought vts and veu , you may as well continue ; vgs is just a lot easier to manage if you 're starting out , because you do n't have to rebalance between vts and veu , do n't have forms to fill out , and it has a drp . 
   what resources should i look at ( other than this subreddit 's wiki ) ? 
   is a vanguard etf good for my situation ? 
  for a lump sum , long-term purchase ? 
  sure , why not . 
  etfs are not so good for small , ongoing investments like i expect a uni student to make , so you might want some kind of interim vehicle to invest in , then dump it into etfs on a 6 or 12-monthly basis . 
   how to i determine asset allocation within an etf ? 
  i looked at the product details of a bunch of managed funds and matched them up with relevant indexes . 
  that got me a good idea of what kind of ratios i was looking to emulate . 
   i 'd like to keep investing a small portion of my wage on a monthly basis . 
  what is a good monthly dollar value ~ ~ if i initially invest 10k ? ~ ~, 
  well , you have a few options . 
  you can open a high interest savings account , do acorns or equivalent , go a bit bigger into a managed fund , or just say `` i 'm investing half my pay and when it gets to a certain size i 'll invest it in one lump sum '' . 
  they all have pros and cons , but in general the easier they are to invest , the lower the long-term returns . 
  but hey , short-term and long-term investments are different anyway . 
   i do n't know anything about finance so should i go with a managed fund ? 
  when i was straight out of university , that 's what i did . 
  if i knew then what i do now , then i probably would have done something different ( not least because when there 's humans in charge of managing your funds , you have to pay attention when they all quit and join another company ), 
  i do n't know how much an ounce is , but i 'll take your word for it . 
  ok cool, 
  it 's a * massive * mana boost when he eats it . 
  and tax brackets , specifically how you do n't `` lose money '' by going up a tax bracket . 
  70 % of all us visas from afghani citizens are rejected . 
  according to the state department , the risk of overstaying , claiming asylum etc is just too great . 
  consider the situation, 
  * afghan ( a poor country ), 
  * female ( thus : persecuted ), 
  * at a high-risk age, 
  * educated, 
  * smart, 
  you can imagine someone in an embassy somewhere going `` shit , i 'd be surprised if ** any of them ** wanted to get back on the plane afterwards '', 
  the immigration department is separate from the visa department , just like the immigration discussion is separate from the visa discussion . 
  an explanation is there . 
  multiple families per house . 
  ... brought to you by the / r/rule34 network . 
  well , you might want to invest in euro indexes while you 're over there . 
  should be able to get reciprocal tax arrangements with australia if you move back . 
  investing elsewhere gets a bit more complicated though . 
  putting it in a high interest bank account is not bad for the short term but that only makes sense if you really do plan on spending it within a couple of years . 
  coaching . 
  only an aussie would consider `` chock-full '' unworthy of further explanation . 
  the aussie ones are gas or electric . 
  just push a button and it heats up . 
  they 're minibosses that you must defeat to get a shot at the title . 
  vas *** already is *** an average bundle of blue chips . 
  ironically , it looks like tf2 is getting more balance fixes than ow is ... 
  work out what percentage of your take-home you 're saving . 
  50 % is good to aim for , although earning more makes that much easier . 
  work out what you want to be doing when you 're 30 . 
  work out what you need to do to accomplish that . 
  maybe you want to start a business when you 're 22 , in which case you do n't have time to invest for the long term . 
  maybe you plan to wait until 30 , in which case you can invest for the long-term , then maybe tweak things when you get closer to when you need the cash . 
  there 's a lot of decisions to make * before * you invest your first dollar . 
  on the other hand , we do n't have handguns . 
  gon na write a tournament bot ? 
  actually are there open source ones ? 
  it 's online , not a lan , so yeah . 
  i 'd rather drink straight beef stock . 
  maybe you need a few sessions of netflix and treadmill, 
  they 're just boxes . 
  also that $ 300/hour is tax deductible . 
  spirit breaker , nyx and to a lesser extent pa tend to feed on lich . 
  very few heroes are good int he jungle now , especially jungling from level 1 . 
  right now , the jungle strategy is to stack ( or stack and pull ) a few times , then the carry + a support clears it for a big boost at level 6 . 
  it 's totally worth popping a sven or ck ult to clear a big stack . 
  * you can always stack the small camps, 
  * safelane hard camps are usually stacked + pulled , but you need to protect them from offlaners who can clear stacks ( otherwise you just gave axe or tide a blink dagger and you will not have a good time ), 
  * ancients should be stacked if you 're in the vicinity . 
  stacking once should be okay for any carry , but big stacks need a hero who can do it - a troll ca n't do it but a sven , medusa or ta certainly can . 
  * all other camps should be stacked if you are in the vicinity at the right time . 
  you just need to make your team aware which camps are stacked , so they can clear them . 
  this is especially important when you start losing outer towers because you need the farm , and you do n't want to let the enemy team take it . 
  lich and ogre are good beginner supports , and can be played as safelane supports or in a dual offlane . 
  not technically difficult to use their spells , and can buff their teammates in the late game when they are no longer a direct threat . 
  ok , but someone who is knowledgable will be able to suggest [ alternatives ] ( http://www.investors.asn.au/education/investment-basics/investment-structures/ ) . 
  like , maybe you set up an investment company and transfer all your investments into it . 
  then you 're only paying the 30 % company tax rate on the income ( you miss out on cgt discount but that 's only an issue if you sell ) . 
  do you have a handle on what percentage of your income you 're saving ? 
  eyeballing it , you should be able to save 70 % of your after-tax income and still have about $ 1000/week left over for living expenses .
