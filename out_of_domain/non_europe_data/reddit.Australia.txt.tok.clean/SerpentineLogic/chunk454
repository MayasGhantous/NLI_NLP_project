  not sure whether that plan really addressed how the power would be generated so it could be stored . 
  it looked like there was a lot of coal and gas involved . 
  i have zero renovation skills , so that course would be as helpful to me as [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fmbl0hs.png ) . 
  ah , you saw purges latest video too . 
  i felt so bad for him , supporting for a mid bounty . 
  someone should hunt them . 
  imagine driving an entire day through country too hot and dry for grass to survive . 
  like that stops us . 
  yeah but you do understand how that basically excludes poor people from the job market right ? 
  i mean a lot of students * could * afford to do months of unpaid work experience during the christmas holidays , but a lot of other people need that time to work an actual job to afford their next year at university . 
  they 're probably also working during the semester , so their marks may already be more dicey than they 'd like , which makes it even harder to compete . 
  having a tonal language helps . 
  i mean , half their superstitions are based on things sounding like other things . 
  whether it 's a good deal or not is moot now . 
  maybe they 'll regret it , maybe they wo n't . 
  either way , the trigger was pulled , and they 're leaving . 
  germany was an interesting situation . 
  * edit : see comment below for more accurate description . 
  [ why not both ] ( http://oi54.tinypic.com/ossqj7.jpg ), 
  take some photos of machu picchu, 
  do n't be . 
  am seriously considering going to ultra in melbourne next year . 
  i just plan to stay away from the big room/glitch artists * shrug *, 
    check out the tour video here, 
   this video has been removed by the user . 
  welp, 
  i 'm more of a psytrance/progressive house kinda guy . 
  yeah it was quite a mindfuck to see where all the 90s djs went . 
  am happy that a few are still kicking it with good tunes , like eric prydz . 
  it might not be a problem with big-c capitalism ( whatever that actually ** is ** ) , but it 's definitely a problem that our * current * system has . 
  depends on the fund you choose . 
  some are really close to the etf they track , or the same price . 
  some are more expensive , but they 're a lot more diversified than a single etf so they 're still competitive . 
  the retail funds are less enticing though . 
  or it gets gutted and turned into trendy apartments . 
  a reasonable person would look at the url and the text of the page where it ** says ** it 's juggernaut . 
  fuck , he 's not even interested in being * internally consistent * . 
  ah yes . 
  when people knew their * place * . 
  it is designed to track the index . 
  no more , no less . 
  if the index has a bad apple in it , tough shit ( for as long as the bad apple remains in the index ), 
  any stock that 's in an index gets more demand , but that demand is spread widely across the entire index , so it 's hard to say it 's a huge distortion of the market . 
  it 's mostly at the * edge * of the index where you see the effect . 
  the fact remains that etfs are good , cheap way to diversify , and you need a well-diversified core in your investment portfolio . 
  you do n't need to go 100 % etfs , but 40-50 % gives you a rock solid base to do more active things with . 
  as the saying goes :, 
  there 's two types of people . 
  those who need closure, 
  what if your bag [ ** is ** the flask ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/mtlms ) ? 
  now you got me worried about where cheetos come from . 
  no idea . 
  i get my fix online . 
  http colon slash slash www dot slash dot dot org, 
  well , he pushed bills funding its expansion , so he can take a sliver of credit . 
  if you want to see a selection of what 's out there : [ ultra music festival live sets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plbg1sjixsxflvpyuruabbimukhphmq7i5 ) ( there 's also equivalents for edc etc ), 
  some of my personal favourites though :, 
  * [ a state of trance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl0cwloyqp6_pkys76fdsafkj_ho4klmea ) - how armin van buuren got his start , and still his personal project, 
  * [ eric prydz ] ( https://soundcloud.com/eric-prydz ) is still doing his stuff , and it 's actually a lot better than his ` call on me ' days . 
  i mean , they named [ an edm technique ] ( https://splice.com/blog/pryda-snare/ ) after him . 
  he put epic radio on hold while he tours , but that 's his monthly set , but he also headlines at trance stages on big festivals so there 's a shitload of live stuff out there every month or so . 
  eric is my current favourite artist , whether he 's releasing stuff as himself , or as pryda or cirez d for his trance and techno songs . 
  * if you like pryda , you 'll probably also like [ estiva ] ( https://soundcloud.com/estivamusic ) . 
  he 's new . 
  * above and beyond have their [ regular show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl6rlee9oarcarcajnotz17dlvzqxahg8g ) , but also started releasing trance stuff as nwyr , which you [ may like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6cldj8ioau&amp;spfreload=10 ) . 
  * kaskade is [ still active ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1opoxkmmua ) and not shit . 
  * deadmau5 is still decent, 
  * fat boy slim is still active as a dj but does n't write new material any more :(, 
  * test went full big room house and imo he 's popular but not to my taste . 
  * paul oakenfold is still doing his thing but tbh it 's pretty mediocre . 
  * and sometimes i just choose someone and follow their music , like this guy who makes [ psytrance sets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ymxez3kzgs ) . 
  it 's not only ' a thing ' ; it 's a big thing . 
  to be fair , that was like 1985 . 
  it was n't a particularly uncommon opinion then . 
  i 've been told to go back to where i came from a few times . 
  but if you think i 'm going back to rockhampton again you can * fuck right off * . 
   have some fucking pride damn it . 
  um , they [ have that already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_pride ) . 
  ok , let 's break it down . 
  politician a talks about urban thugs preying on innocent people and how he will fix the problem . 
  * most people will go `` urban thugs ? 
  sounds bad , i 'm glad he 's fixing the problem '' ( neutral or positive reaction ), 
  * some people will go `` what urban thugs ? 
  i live in this city and crime is fine . '', 
  ( neutral or negative reaction ), 
  * a few people will go `` oh , he means * niggers * . 
  ** he gets my vote ** '' ( way positive ), 
  * a few people will go `` oh , he means black people . 
  ** he wo n't get my vote ** '' . 
  ( way negative ), 
  so by using dog-whistle terms , the politician will get most people on-side with a fairly innocuous term , and get a minority of voters * really happy * with him . 
  he risks alienating some other voters , but in practice :, 
  * they were unlike to vote for him anyway, 
  * his party will have made sure that the ` urban thug ' term is spread more widely in the racist demographic - priming the pump , so to speak, 
  * this means only the narrow demographic he 's aiming for actually understands what he 's saying, 
  * he will be careful to rebuke suggestions that he * actually * means black people - the mainstream will take him at his word , and the racists know that he 's one of them already due to the terminology he used , and they 'll understand that sometimes you have to deny you have an extreme position , because they have to do the same thing themselves . 
  feels left out . 
  i 'd wait , at least for the other employer to get their act into gear . 
  not if oracle or dazzle prevent it .
