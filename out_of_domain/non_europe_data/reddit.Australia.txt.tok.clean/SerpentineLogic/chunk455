  really enjoying this guy .

  [ chopper stabbing scene .

  cane toads are notoriously hard to kill . 
  like , `` take a gol ** f ** club to them and they do n't give a shit '' level . 
  it 's about as incorrect as calling billiards ` pool ' . 
  [ brand of shoes ] ( https://www.colorado.com.au/ ),

  well , elon musk is [ swinging by adelaide ] ( https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/884664723429498880 ) . 
  maybe he 's scoping out woomera while he 's down there . 
  * big fuel savings as you get closer to the equator, 
  * for top-secret missions it 's great to have land to the east so you can recover all the parts of your spy satellite before it 's stolen , but in modern times it 's better to have water to the east . 
  * ( why ? 
  because then you can land the first stage on a boat and drag it back to base for a lot cheaper than moving it overland ),

  til . 
  skilling 2 points is good , so the cooldown means you at least get 1 cs every minute/every 2 creep waves - good if you 're otherwise getting little farm . 
  maxing it first is probably a serious mistake though . 
   why are people from certain places being banned ? 
  short answer : because they tend to break the terms of their visas . 
  long answer : [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6lba1a/denied_us_visas_allgirl_afghan_robotics_team_to/djsno0j/ ), 
  did they run ... * amok * ? 
  okay which one of us is alice and which one is bob ? 
  well / r/nba and / r/dota have an overlap that surprised me . 
  maybe mull over the similarities of the games and see if you can draw some analogies that might be more familiar to newcomers . 
  about the only thing you are allowed to carry are the fuck off loud personal alarm things . 
  i assume you 'll charge 40 % more to compensate ? 
  if you go caster pl , a soul ring or bottle might be a good pick up, 
  your first priority is an emergency fund , not investments . 
  you need the ability to buy a laptop at short notice because yours broke 1 day before an assignment is due , or replace your phone or whatever . 
  sure , credit cards allow that , but it could take a long time to pay off at $ 240/week minus expenses . 
  that emergency fund is fine in a cash saver account . 
  so , you probably only have about 2k to invest . 
  i suggest something designed for small sums , like acorns or stock spot or i guess rate setter might be an option . 
  that 's why as a support , i work out when it 's time to gank , and buy wards and a smoke . 
  wards for aggressive vision in their jungle , smoke to get there , and a friend or two to make the kills . 
  i upload live sets from sound cloud into google play . 
  you ca n't access them via web if they are n't in the google music catalog , but they sync to your devices fine . 
  do his parents have an emergency fund too ? 
  do n't make assumptions ; poor kids have families as well a rich ones . 
  is there any reason you , i mean your mate ca n't just get stuff online ? 
  yeah but google is n't going to know which artist a 2 hour set from creamfields belongs to , so they wo n't stream it back to you if they are n't sure they have streaming rights . 
  acacia ridge is n't a bad area per se . 
  it 's just a historically poor area . 
  i think you 'll be fine taking the 110 , but if you 're not sure , maybe your bf can take public transport to ice world the first time and you can bus back together to scope it out . 
  idk about owning it , but his dad * manages * both rinks . 
  as you can see , while there 's lots of authentically australian savoury snacks and desserts , there 's no quintessentially aussie main course . 
  our outdoor bbq usage comes close though ; throwing some sausages , steak , onions and chicken kebabs on the bbq is a time-honoured and familiar pastime ; hence why burgers are also a suggestion . 
  note that you can invest in the same things ; just not joint . 
  joint stuff is a massive pain in the arse . 
  if you 're a visual learner , then perhaps infographics like this will help you understand why your next purchase should probably be for stuff outside australia . 
  no tail morph is a great example of split pushing and opportunistic stacking, 
  `` it was a fall , not a fall from grace '', 
  here 's the thing, 
  3/4 actually . 
  ok , go to a lawyer and tell them what you want . 
  they will draw up an official loan agreement for each of you , stating terms , like :, 
  * x amount of money lent between parties a and b. 
  * y % interest , calculated < monthly  and paid < monthly  . 
  * no fixed term ; the lender can call it in at will . 
  this is a common request , they should charge a couple hundred bucks and you 're good to go . 
  why get a lawyer involved ? 
  * you are family ; your gf is not . 
  this is for her safety . 
  * people occasionally go crazy . 
  this is for your safety, 
  * people get into arguments over money . 
  this is for the safety of all your relationships . 
  * people die , and inheritance issues can tear a family apart . 
  america is the high functioning alcoholic of corruption . 
   what 's wrong with trump ? 
  many things , but that 's a topic for / r/outoftheloop or private messages , not here . 
   they are only activated when needed as they cant roll 24/7 . 
  they actually can roll 24/7 . 
  it 's fine that they have an off switch ( nobody expects them to be on when you 're in the bathroom or chatting with your partner with the windows up ) , but they 100 % * should be * on when talking with the public , or doing things in public . 
  well , / r/conservative is a really touchy sub . 
  one might even say they act a bit like snowflakes . 
  * car cam/audio should be turned on whenever the lights are flashing . 
  * body cam/audio should be turned on when they get out of the car ** or when they roll down the window to talk to someone ** . 
  the cops are probably already trained to turn on the cams when they exit the vehicle , but they were still in the car in this situation . 
  microservices : how important is sharding data per microservice ? 
  ( one persistent data store per service ) vs enrichment , caching , daos etc, 
  the general opinion seems to be that p2p lending has not been tested during a downturn . 
  each lender has a pool that covers defaults , but is that pool * sufficient * ? 
  so , as always , do n't invest more than you can afford to lose . 
  what about eight fingers in the ring ? 
  it all comes down to the chain of trust . 
   with these new features , cognito user pools can authenticate and manage both sets of users : those who sign in directly to your user pool and those who sign in through an external identity provider . 
  ** all users will have profiles ** and tokens provided by your user pool . 
  that 's not correct . 
  good bot . 
  what was your itemisation ? 
  ( bearing in mind that when you 're up to 800 duel damage , it 's probably time to ditch the blademail ), 
  i find that satanic is a ideal 6th item if you feel you need to carry . 
  lc works fine to delete one hero ( then probably die ) , but if the rest of your team ca n't win a teamfight 4v4 then you need to exit the duel on as high health as possible , because your job is not done . 
  at the least you should try to keep track of the buyback status of the most dangerous player on their team . 
   you would skip malestrom altogether ? 
  mael is a very situational pickup , vs heroes like brood and pl , where you need to clear units away ( these are the types of games where you buy pms as well ) .
