  under normal circumstances , your * mid * will be the maelstrom carrier , and will help you duel with mjolnir active so you do n't have to buy one . 
   do you ever sell blink ? 
  generally never . 
  you ** need ** to get into melee range and you can not afford to be kited . 
  sometimes you build shadow blade and blink because you need to get into their back lines and start killing people . 
  you shadow blade in , then blink further and initiate . 
  i do n't think anyone in australia sees it as a race issue either . 
  it 's the whole `` calling the cops then being killed by them '' angle that 's pissed us off . 
  yeah but you ca n't compare a casual mael to a mjolnir ; you can almost buy an armlet with the gold difference . 
  if you decide to go the full mjolnir , you need to compare it against an assault cuirass . 
  mjolnir is +80 as . 
  +24 damage an active and a proc for 5700g . 
  ac provides +55 as and +15 armor to you , but * also * provides +25 as and +5 armor to friendlies and -5 armour to enemies and buildings for 5250g . 
  ac has everything that lc needs :, 
  * a big chunk of armor - good on a hero that you can guarantee is going to take rightclicks during a duel, 
  * a decent chunk of attack speed, 
  * armor reduction on enemies to leverage moc and duel stacks, 
  * a helpful teamfight and pushing aura, 
  lc is slot starved , so a defensive item with + as bonus is really valuable . 
  after a point , lc stops needing more damage and starts needing ways to survive through , and after , a duel . 
  depends on the game . 
  if your teammates do a lot of damage ( like you have a friendly weaver ) then all you need to do is soak damage , so platemail . 
  if you 're doing solo pickoffs and expect to die or tp out after each duel , then maybe you get the hyperstone to ensure you pick up the duel stack . 
  there was no cost to transfer when i signed up for cmc . 
  well , yeah . 
  that 's the responsible option . 
  the alternative is india keeps it and makes nukes with it . 
  do n't even * start * looking until you have 50k saved , not including gifts . 
  at 1k per month , maybe aim for four purchases a year . 
  i 'm dubious about this claim . 
  the cops asked * her * to come out to the patrol car instead of them going to her door . 
  so they knew she was coming . 
  a statement made by her family back when this first hit . 
  $ 8 per quarter . 
  the major thing is that etfs can go down as well as up . 
  you do n't have a lot of runway to recover if you can only wait 6-12 months before you need the money . 
  thanks for the heads up . 
  i put in an order just now . 
  hence why poor man 's shield is really good vs pl . 
  some games are mek games , but others are urn or medallion games . 
  when you say ` liquidity ' , what do you mean ? 
  because etfs are pretty liquid . 
  does your lineup imply some sort of group-early-and-pubtrain-down-a-lane play style ? 
  that 's a mek game . 
  does either team have a - armor strat going on ? 
  then once the laning phase ends , a medallion might save a teammates life , or secure a kill . 
  ( sometimes tanky heroes need more than a frost blast to go down ), 
  does either side 's lineup imply some kind of ganking/pickoff style early and mid game ? 
  then you probably ca n't afford a mek but you need sustain for your team , so if nobody else is going urn , then you can . 
  there 's many situations where you pick up other items instead of mek . 
  vs antimage or qop sometimes you need an atos . 
  vs np etc sometimes you need a force staff . 
  surely they could compromise on 3/5 of a living wage ... 
  getting a model portfolio is simple . 
  choose a managed fund you like the look of ( e.g. 
  vanguard has a [ high growth fund ] ( https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/funddetail/retail/portid=8127/ ) ), 
  then look at the fact sheet ( page 2 ) and it will tell you the product mix - growth vs income , international vs domestic etc etc. 
  vanguard is easy because pretty-much each line item is backed by one of their own etfs , but you can look under the hood of managed funds by other companies to get an idea of what their ` ideal portfolio ' is . 
  then , you can replicate one that you like the look of , or simplify it so you 're not buying 10 different etfs each year . 
  most people generally start with 1 etf then work their way up to 2-4 over the years . 
  cmc is [ 0.1 % ] ( https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/stockbroking/brokerage-rates#shares ) ( minimum $ 11 ) and they 're chess-sponsored . 
  note the mek is actually fairly expensive even though the buildup is pretty decent . 
  sometimes it 's better to just spend 750 gold on an early game item and keep your team strong by being active . 
  not if your hero does n't build arcane boots . 
  same for 1k, 
  i 've seen people go soul ring into aghs . 
  that seems good . 
  cheap sustain that you can turn into a big chunk of mana, 
  ah , countered by a good tree . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  i went to one in sydney . 
  idk if that 's close enough . 
  the java market in brisbane is pretty decent . 
  many government departments are ee shops , although i think the cops are on ms stack . 
  there are also a couple of banks/fintech companies that hire . 
  they 're easier to get into the more experience you have , since they have offshore partners to do the bulk of the non-lead tech roles . 
  the job market seems pretty okay recently , imo ; recruiters reach out to me with a role every few weeks . 
  might be 12 hour shifts with 4 days on , 4 days off . 
   just avoid some areas and situations, 
  mate , if you 're not safe being a white woman in a rich area * when you are the one calling the cops * , then it must be ** really fucking hard ** to tell which `` areas and situations '' to avoid . 
  do n't blame the ato for going after people it can actually * do * something about . 
   but why has he devoted so much time and energy helping prisoners rehabilitate , when he almost lost his daughter to a convicted rapist ? 
   `` he was just one bloke . 
  if you 're not prepared to do something then you have got nothing to complain about . 
  you ca n't just help victims and have no one try to straighten the others out . '', 
  helping both victims and ( some ) perpetrators takes a lot of heart . 
  they even have an [ aws service for that ] ( https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-connect-customer-contact-center-in-the-cloud/ ) . 
  how about, 
  * no , and, 
  * you 're not my fucking boss , mate . 
  sometimes your strategy dictates a mid with an aoe silence , but that can push as well . 
  uh yeah . 
  they * started * that web site . 
   if you are in australia or new zealand you can also check out http://www.blinddatewithabook.com.au which is our online store based in australia . 
  [ tfw ] ( https://www.blinddatewithabook.com/pages/about-us ), 
  it 's a transfer of wealth from people who have 0 houses to people with 2 + houses, 
  the idea is to siphon a couple of enemies while you 're being attacked , then euls yourself to buy time for it to heal you . 
  then you shift queue silence for when you land , and apply 2 more siphons and moonwalk out . 
   is there anything wrong with playing him mostly mid ? 
  well his attack animation is bad , so the enemy mid might deny creeps you 're going for and gain incremental advantage .
