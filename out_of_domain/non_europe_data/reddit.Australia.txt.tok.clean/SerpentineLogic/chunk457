  and his wave clear is nonexistent so getting runes will cost you more lost cs . 
  just seems like a better safelaner than mid though . 
   in the case of clinkz , this is a bit awkward : if you 're shoving out lanes , the enemy knows where you are , which makes you a lot less threatening, 
  the same goes for slark and other ganking carries - they try not to show in lane . 
  but surely that 's something you can draft around ? 
  like , choosing a manta hero as a carry and then you can push a lane while keeping your carry and mid off the map . 
  * wager 1000 -  2 levels, 
  * add 1000 tribute -  1 level, 
  * max level quest -  0.8 levels, 
  * daily hero -  0.1 levels, 
  * weekly quests -  ? 
  so almost 4 levels for $ 1 . 
  that compares favourably to just buying levels i guess . 
  teams never push until high skill bracket anyway so you 're doing valuable work, 
  then you probably already know what we will say . 
  what recommendations have you picked up so far ? 
  that 's not a responsible approach to speculation . 
  * never risk more than you can afford to lose , and, 
  * choose a percentage of your portfolio for speculation * and stick to it *, 
  located safe and well . 
  if you catch botulism from that meat , you could actually just fucking die . 
  so yeah . 
  sounds like * you * need to learn the difference between an investment and a commodity . 
  you ask anyway . 
  it 's the polite thing to do . 
  but yanks put butyric acid in theirs , which gives a vomit aftertaste . 
  his and her skin colour are immaterial to the depth of our anger . 
  fiftee/fiftee chance of being right . 
  do n't forget the various fintech startups scattered here and there . 
  well , warning signs are [ already going up ] ( http://imgur.com/a/izxp3 ) . 
  they 're niche employers , but when op fills the `` financial analyst familiar with the ** us ** industry '' niche , that might work to their mutual benefit . 
  is n't storm one of those heroes where you turn on ` auto-attack after spells ' ? 
  sometimes you have to mute someone for being an asshole . 
  sometimes you have to mute * yourself * because you 're being an asshole . 
  newman was a nutjob ; even the lavish infrastructure projects were based more on ` what makes headlines ' rather than ` what brisbane or queensland needs ' . 
  anna p is better , but still sails very close to lnp waters because she 's more interested in keeping her party in power than making big changes . 
  like , that 's her perogative to choose that strategy , but i do n't have to like it . 
  houses in a good catchment area costs a premium , but it does n't disappear like school fees ; that premium will keep your sell price high just like any other aspect of the house . 
  you have the same percentage for asia as you have for the entire developed world ? 
  personally i value the diversification of etfs , because my investment history has shown i 'm not so good with picking individual stocks ( or advisors who pick for me ), 
   however , the asx is very heavy on banks at the top , so i think i 'd be reluctant to go into an asx200 fund anyway . 
  well there 's always ex20 , which is the asx21-200 . 
  you setting yourself up on https://www.barcraft.com/ ? 
  they did n't * own * it , but they sure * kept * it . 
  useful to the aged , or useful to the aged care industry ? 
  i mean , there 's overlap , but the aged are n't as interested in robot vacuums , floor washers and lawmowers . 
  imo there 's three things that the aged need more of, 
  * health/safety ( i imagine fitbit etc will move into this space ), 
  * communication with others ( i.e. 
  the reason there are still non-smart phones being sold etc ), 
  entertainment is a distant third imo , if you 're thinking of vr like some people . 
  yeah , i guess just spread your net as wide as you can . 
  then you do n't want robots per se ; you want digital assistants and home automation . 
  voice activated stuff . 
  the fitbit thing was just a throwaway idea - there are now bluetooth enabled consumer hardware that can tell when you 're sleeping or awake by movement and heart rate , or buzz your wrist as an additional notification if you 're deaf to a phone call . 
  asia as a whole has 33 % of the world 's market cap . 
  us + europe have 40.6 and 19.5 % , so that 's  60 % . 
  so yeah , you might be a bit overweight in asia ( no fat jokes pls ) . 
  it 's not a bad thing per se ; just wanted to make sure it was a deliberate choice instead of a maths error . 
   i guess it balances out if i 'm investing more into a region that has a smaller market cap , and less into a region that has higher market cap ? 
  well , you only have so much money to go around , and only 100 percentage points to allocate for your ratios . 
  after a certain point you may need to plough more money into the other markets to keep within your target band . 
  a $ 5k investment more regularly is probably worth looking at over $ 10k chunks , for a few reasons :, 
  * opportunity cost of say , $ 7k sitting in a bank account instead of in shares waiting for the next $ 3k, 
  * dollar cost averaging , so if there 's a slump for 6 months you will pick up some bargains , and if there 's a spike for 6 months you only buy half as much, 
  * you may also find balancing your funds easier with more regular investments . 
  it 's neither here nor there , imo . 
  none of them are perfect . 
  * cba is expensive, 
  * ig is n't chess sponsored, 
  * cmc does n't do direct international shares ( that i know of ), 
  imo look at the thing that each of them lacks , and decide whether that 's immediately important to you . 
  ok so you ca n't realistically buy property now , but you need to accept the gift pretty much immediately . 
  talk to your parents about whether they would be okay with you investing it elsewhere until you can support a home loan . 
  having a big deposit is not enough ; you need the income as well . 
  maybe this will help ? 
  it 's 75k , probably a couple . 
  maybe 50 50 split between vas and vgs . 
  it 's simpler to explain to his parents that way . 
  maybe http://howdoiplay.com/?tinker etc ? 
  as a previous wesley patient , i 'm so jealous . 
  well , if you have 500 nab shares you get a [ free ] ( https://www.nab.com.au/about-us/shareholder-centre/shareholder-benefits ) platinum credit card . 
  i do n't think i 'd bother having one if it were n't for that . 
  agreed . 
  it 's a nice perk if you already have them , though . 
  whichever one sounds the most fun . 
  so choose something close to it . 
  do you like the prodigy 's [ edm stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmvtkooy1uk ) ? 
  how about [ pendulum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqebzauvila ) ? 
  edit : how about [ the prodigy plus pendulum ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wru2advmpt0 ), 
  tldr ; looks like a combination of, 
  * actual shock torture, 
  * things that do n't work, 
  * lobotomy, 
  depending on which era . 
  bank accounts and term deposits are ** capital-stable ** investments . 
  that means you might only get a few percent in interest , but you have basically zero chance of * losing * money ( barring world wars etc ) . 
  most capital-stable investments are also ** income-generating ** , i.e. 
  cash money .
