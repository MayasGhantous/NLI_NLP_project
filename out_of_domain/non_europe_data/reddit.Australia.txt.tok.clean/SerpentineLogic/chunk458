  stuff like shares , investment properties , managed funds etc have a higher earning potential , but go * down * as well as up . 
  great if you squirrel some money away and let it ride for a few years ; not so great if you need the money in the middle of a slump . 
  shares etc are usually a mixture of income ( dividends = cash money ) and growth ( share price rises , which only matters when you sell them ) . 
  ** growth assets ** are generally better in the long term , for a variety of tax reasons , but only if you can afford to let them accumulate . 
  if you invest that entire $ 5k in a long-term investment , you will be in the shit if your car breaks down . 
  you * need * that for emergencies , so a high-interest savings account is probably the best place to keep your ** emergency fund ** . 
  you can pull the money out if you need it and it will only set you back 1 month 's worth of interest . 
  the * next * $ 5k you save up can be used for more long-term investments , provided you do n't expect to need the money for a few years . 
  as you get closer to a major purchase ( like , a house or whatever ) , then you will need to dial back on long-term investment and redirect your money into capital-stable investments , but that 's probably a few years down the track . 
  [ 1200 micrograms - acid for nothing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9csgjkeg86s ), 
  i 'd just go payg . 
  the ato has pierced the corporate veil way too much for personal services income to be worth it through a shell corporation . 
  iirc the trust thing can be done without the corporation , but it 's still a fair bit of hassle . 
  * vgs is `` the developed world except australia '', 
  * veu is `` the eurozone '', 
  so you have something like a 40 % overlap there . 
  probably not what you want . 
  what do you expect to happen during a downturn ? 
  presumably at the disco ? 
  probably easier to do vgs instead of vts veu split, 
  if you 're concerned about the ratio , perhaps look at the breakdown for one of vanguard 's blended funds . 
  : vanguard lifestrategy \u00ae high growth fund, 
  * domestic 45 % ( 40 % shares + 5 % property ), 
  * international shares 40.5 % ( 31 % shares , 5 % property , 4.5 % small cap ), 
  * 90 % growth total, 
  * emerging markets 4.5 %, 
  * various cash/income assets : 10 %, 
  * 10 % income total, 
  really though , the ratio between domestic and international stuff also has to take into consideration what you have in super . 
  in my case , i have a fair bit of domestic exposure via super so i bias away from australia in my other investments . 
  anyway you can adjust the ratio as you continue to invest . 
  it 's not something that 's set in stone . 
  i prefer to manage my vge ratio myself rather than having it a part of veu . 
  looks like it 's [ right about here ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/5743nswspgb2 ) , looking up the hill a bit . 
  it 's been 60 years ; it is actually possible that they knocked it down and put up a new one in that time . 
  use chat wheel, 
  bind keys to extra chat commands . 
  well , rolling 1 month rate setter or equivalent might be higher . 
  but riskier of course, 
  if you go direct , you pay vanguard , and it gives you units in a mutual fund . 
  that mutual fund then buys etfs with the money . 
  you do not own the etfs . 
  in return , the vanguard mutual fund will handle rebalancing , buying and selling etfs when you deposit and withdraw , and accepts eftpos . 
  going direct is like ordering at a restaurant . 
  buying etfs is like cooking at home . 
  you wo n't have the nice seasonings and truffle oil and you have to prepare and cook it yourself , but you 're saving money and making a dish the way you want it . 
  wish i was old enough to buy shares that day . 
  i 'd just set up an automatic transfer each fortnight . 
  well , yeah , but the money disappears the day i get paid so it 's not as if i notice it missing . 
  i do n't live paycheck to paycheck though . 
  this also goes for car trailers . 
  put some reflectors on the sides , because it 's much harder to see the rear lights from that angle . 
  * it 's * never * too early to pay attention to what % of your pay you save . 
  * you * can * be penny-wise and pound-foolish if you scrimp and save on a low income instead of spending time , money and effort improving your earning potential . 
  personally , i just aimed to keep my bank balance stable instead of growing while at university , because i knew that i 'd have way more income once i graduated . 
  once i had a job , out came the 50 % savings rate and suddenly investment was a realistic possibility . 
  i unbound that from my chat wheel , since i can just ctrl-alt click in the shop . 
   someone should purchase observer ward . 
  yes , but only if you were buying dominator already . 
  i 'm just paying down my leverage,

  well keeping it in the variable saves you more money than in the fixed . 
  personally i think it 's a good idea to concentrate on paying down home loans for the first couple of years , because you save more money due to stopping the compounding of the interest you owe . 
  once you get the loan down to half , you can reassess . 
  employers split that 18k into smaller amounts based on how long your pay cycle is . 
  if you earn enough in one pay , you will pay tax on the overage . 
  it 's better , but there are still serious problems with the entire system . 
  i do n't believe the republican plan will make things better . 
  no drama obama, 
  to be fair , there 's only fifty of us . 
  make your own breakfast and lunch , instead of buying . 
  it can save you over $ 2000 per year . 
  yeah this was the intel that trump leaked to the world as coming from an israeli spy in the middle east . 
  israel was less than pleased about that . 
  actually modern planes are much more resistant to ( small ) bombs in checked luggage compartments compared to in the cabin . 
  oce oce oce, 
  what part of it are you interested in ? 
  well , if he wants to tithe then let him , as long as it does n't compromise his investment goals . 
  at least he 's spending the money on others . 
  it just means that he 'll have to live off 40 % of his income instead of 50 % if he wants to save half his pay to invest with . 
  well , as others have said , the way to get ` into ' the it industry , given that you already have a degree is, 
  ### go to meet ups, 
  ... and learn about the industry ( you do n't have an area of specialisation yet so you could easily go to a dozen different meet ups a month, 
  i mean , just in the next * week * theres, 
  * https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-amazon-alexa-meetup/events/240657588/, 
  * https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-robotics-interest-group/events/240590928/, 
  * https://www.meetup.com/cto-school-brisbane/events/241966086/ ( might be on the same day ), 
  * https://www.meetup.com/devops-brisbane/events/241743097/, 
  * https://www.meetup.com/game-technology-brisbane/events/241811065/, 
  and that 's only the it meet ups , for * one * week , in * one * city , that * is n't * sydney or melbourne . 
  ### play with the technology, 
  say you want to learn about serverless cloud tech . 
  well , you go to serverless.com and start doing the tutorials . 
  or maybe you want to learn about python or docker or react.js or sharepoint or whatever . 
  there 's something out there to learn , and since you ca n't learn it on the job , learn off the job . 
  ### show it to others, 
  set up a github account and put your stuff there .
