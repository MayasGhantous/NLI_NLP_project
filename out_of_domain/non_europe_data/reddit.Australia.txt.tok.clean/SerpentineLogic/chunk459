  set up an aws account and host your little app . 
  ( or heroku or azure or whatever , idc ) . 
  hell , buy a raspberry pi and host it at home and hook up some flashing leds . 
  just have something to show an employer that you 're passionate and not terrible at this it stuff . 
  ### network, 
  the last step ( which should really be the second step ) is that now that you have something to show others , and the confidence that you 're at least a junior level of skill at a few technologies , is that you start going to meet ups * with a purpose * . 
  you now aim to turn your acquaintance with the people there into job leads or offers . 
  ### never stop improving, 
  whether you get a job immediately or are still slogging away , never stop learning . 
  employers do n't need people who know java 5 and vb6 - they already have shitloads of employees who know it already , and can hire a bunch more people in other countries if they run out . 
  your role as a new entrant to it is to specialise in technologies where you are on an even footing with their existing 40-year-old employees . 
  that means new technologies , or new ways of doing things . 
  devops , reactive web frameworks , ai , iot , whatever amazon came out with last week ; that 's your jam . 
  if you keep learning , then you 'll never be left behind , and you 'll always be in demand . 
  only if the people were indigenous . 
  i assume you 're ploughing everything into the offset account while you 're still deciding ? 
  will you have to permanently transfer money from the offset into the loan as part of the refinancing deal ? 
  * if you refinance the house to a different lender , then you should be able to pick up all the cash in your offset account and move it to the new loan without loss of control . 
  * if you are taking out an * additional * investment loan against the house to unlock some equity , then it gets more awkward . 
  if you have a 500k loan with 300k in the offset account , they probably wo n't treat you the same as if you had a 500k loan that you 've paid 300k into permanently . 
  depends on the lender - usually something they will tell you up front . 
  i 'm not very familiar with debt recycling , but there 's usually a sweet spot where you can take out an investment loan while you still have a residential loan but i do n't know when exactly that would be . 
  personally , i paid off my loan entirely before starting up the next one . 
  especially with soul ring , although that might be overkill . 
  a note : disruptor is * great * while you 're ahead , but not so great when you 're behind . 
  for me , a lifetime of buyer 's remorse has conditioned me to avoid purchasing stuff because it will just be a disappointment . 
  which patch did quill spray become auto-castable ? 
  what if they want to stay natty tho, 
  aghs tends to be soul ring/bottle into aghs because it 's a farm accelerator . 
  diffusal first lends itself to the old-style diffusal/manta/bots splitpush build , which you ca n't always get away with . 
  right , but if you 're going s&y , then you get maim procs already , so you 're unlikely to go back for a diffusal unless forced to . 
  well , see for yourself . 
  go to https://www.dotabuff.com/players/your_player_id/activity and see what your win rate is each day and each time . 
  take a look at your game replays . 
  are your deaths due to situations where you were grossly out of position due to poor choice of where to go ( solo warding without being smoked etc ) , or are they tactical mistakes that could have been avoided by just being too poor to afford a blink or force staff at the time , or even just by having tranquils + wind lace ? 
  that will narrow down what type of decision-making you need to improve on . 
  i 'm not disputing that - but you usually decide pretty early whether this will be a caster pl or splitpush pl game , because the level 10 and 15 talents lend themselves towards choosing one or the other . 
  only thing he lacks is healing , but i like to get extra tango or a salve for my carry . 
  eventually they 'll use the courier for something so i can get it shipped to me . 
  i spend my money on experiences , not things . 
  then idk what he 's talking about, 
  tab indexing on the form is not correct, 
  ha , i know that feeling . 
  i think i went 3/16 and 6/13 the last two times i played veno . 
  after playing a lot of lich i just get caught out so often on a slow hero . 
  [ payback ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/payback_\\ ( 1999_film \\ ) ), 
  hard to predict , but i think rates will rise a bit then stay stable , as the flow on effects crimp the housing market and people pull their heads in . 
  if there 's an actual recession then the dollar will likely drop . 
  the aud is about 80c so it 's not the worst time to get some international exposure . 
  * counsel, 
  dust , and a blink or shadow amulet . 
  it 's mostly for documentaries . 
  i often find myself casting press the attack on my carry . 
  sometimes it 's for the heal , but usually to purge off a stun . 
  lc is slot-starved though , so soul ring is the kind of item that gets replaced fairly quickly . 
  like he needs an excuse, 
   he 's being a smart arse . 
  the second-best type of arse . 
  just buy for quality . 
  i hear a lot of bad things about the build quality of new apartment blocks that makes me suspect that the body corporate fees will skyrocket after 5 years . 
  then buy a javelin . 
  at least it builds into basher . 
  well , it does offer * computershare * $ 50 . 
  to elaborate : when you pull , these things happen . 
  * a bunch of neutral creeps will die . 
  anyone who is nearby will get xp , and the support that pulled will also take last hits for gold while the lane creeps tank the jungle camp . 
  * a bunch of your lane creeps will die . 
  this stops the offlaner from getting that xp , and the support gets some extra xp from any denies . 
  if you pulled the small jungle camp , there will be lane creeps left over ( this is ** not good ** ) unless steps are taken ( usually by stacking the small camp beforehand , or chain-pulling the hard camp into the small at just the right time ) . 
  * without an entire wave of your creeps to meet them , the enemy creep wave will push a long distance . 
  your carry may even need to tank the creep wave if they want to avoid the wave pushing into tower range . 
  if they are a ranged carry or are low on sustain , this may upset them . 
  if so , give them a tango to calm them down . 
  * since the wave now meets just outside your t1 tower , your carry can now farm in a much safer position ; close to the tower , harder to wrap around behind them , and the lane creeps you pulled provide a bit of jungle vision before they die so that 's a nice perk . 
  * since the creep equilibrium has been altered , the offlaner now has to walk really deep into your side of the map to soak xp . 
  this means they can be easily cut off and murdered by your pos 1 , 4 and 5 , which sets them back even further . 
  * after you gank the offlane a couple of times , they will either ditch the offlane entirely , or will be too far behind to contest the carry . 
  either way , the lane is won . 
  * this means the lane support is free to gank mid and offlane, 
  * or they can keep pulling once a minute , to get xp and gold while the carry clears entire waves without the lane pushing too far . 
  pretty sure xero does tax . 
  you can bind a hot key to `` select other units '' ( ie units aside from your hero ) . 
  then just double tap that key . 
  it was a liver/die situation . 
  well that sounds distasteful as fuck . 
  i call myself an attack helicopter . 
  does n't make it true . 
  * v for great vigor * [ . 
  `` we cut funding and who did n't stop us ? 
  labor ! '', 
  do n't speak ; i know just what you 're saying . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i mean , abortion is a touchy issue , immigration has some really strong feelings on both sides , but two consenting adults having sex in a way you do n't like ? 
  ** that 's ** the hill you want to die on ? 
  it was a bold strategy , cotton . 
  let 's see if it paid off for him . 
  land tax is a bit controversial because people who are land-rich but money-poor will be slugged with higher taxes . 
  i do n't have a lot of sympathy for them , but hey , a lost vote is a lost vote . 
  as far as the empty home tax , vancouver has this :, 
  tldr :,
