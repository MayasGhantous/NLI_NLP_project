  [ red vs blue ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/2011/10/rifters-are-red-merlins-are-blue-whats.html ) . 
  progress is a nebulous term * . 
  tell us [ what you want to do ] ( http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ ) , and we can suggest ways to get there . 
  \\* ( no pun intended ), 
   it 's most likely that ccp decided it 's not a priority so they 've shelved it, 
  arek ` jaalan is a player-run event , i believe . 
  * new bonuses : 5 % bonus to ~ ~ optimal range ~ ~ small hybrid turret damage and 5 % to shield resistances per level, 
  * slot layout : ~ ~ 4 ~ ~ 3 high , 4 mid , 3 low ; ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ 3 turrets and ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ no launchers . 
  * fittings : ~ ~ 35 ~ ~ 40 pwg , ~ ~ 175 ~ ~ 180 cpu, 
  * defense ( shields / armor / hull ) : ~ ~ 469 ~ ~ 500 / ~ ~ 351 ~ ~ 350 / ~ ~ 313 ~ ~ 400, 
  * capacitor ( amount / recharge rate / cap per second ) : 350 / ~ ~ 234 ~ ~ 175 s / ~ ~ 1.5 ~ ~ 2, 
  * targeting ( max targeting range / scan resolution / max locked targets ) : ~ ~ 30 ~ ~ 50km / ~ ~ 550 ~ ~ 580 / ~ ~ 4 ~ ~ 5, 
  * sensor strength : 11 gravimetric, 
  * signature radius : ~ ~ 40 ~ ~ 39, 
  this is true . 
  ions even fit with awu ii , as long as the relevant subsystem skills are maxed . 
  the app would be better if one could actually register . 
  did that . 
  still nope . 
  i get to [ here ] ( http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com/register/save ) , but not logged in and my account does not exist . 
  `` an intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex . '', 
  yes . 
  legion + thanatos . 
  things usually fit on an orca :, 
  * ** mining foreman link - laser optimization ** : mine ore faster , duh, 
  * ** small tractor beam ii ** : tractor wrecks and cans over, 
  * ** survey scanner ** : tag juicy roids so your hulks do n't have to fit one, 
  * ** damage control ii ** : increases your tank significantly, 
  things sometimes fit on an orca :, 
  * 100mn microwarpdrive + improved cloak for cloak/mwd trick, 
  * reinforced bulkheads for extra tank, 
  * x-large shield booster : more tank, 
  * large shield transporter : rep up your pet hulks, 
  * salvager : salvage wrecks so as not to provide warp-ins, 
  * siege warfare link - shield harmonizing : extra tank, 
  that one is by far the best . 
  the laser range thing is still useful if you feel like using it , but the capacitor use one probably is n't . 
  also : train everything to iii before you start working on iv and v. skill training is easy mode when you queue up a long skill then login once a day to front-load 17 hours of faster skills ... 
  imma let hallan turek finish , but 60km + ranged stealth bombers really are n't common . 
  stealth bomber tactics fall into two groups :, 
  * bombing runs, 
  * black-ops hot drops and solo work, 
  bombing runs involve agility modules , a bomb , an mwd and that 's about it . 
  if you expect to fire your torps you 're doing it wrong . 
  hot drops involve no bombs and balls-to-the-wall dps . 
  nemesis and manticore provide ewar and utility mids , purifier and hound provide moar deeps . 
  all bombers should fit a long point and a 1-slot shield tank . 
  sometimes they even use afterburners and mse fits . 
  legion ( or any ship with good turret-based dps ) for killing cruisers and smaller , while being agile enough to align fast . 
  it does n't have to be a legion ; i 've seen it done with zealots , and even punishers . 
  if you like , you can use a machariel . 
  thanatos for assigning five bonused fighter drones for helping take down battleships . 
  for plexes that do n't allow assigned fighters , a couple of remote-rep tengus work well . 
  jester seems to [ think otherwise ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/play-to-your-strengths.html ) . 
  i do n't have a carrier atm , so i ca n't check my drone damage messages to check , 
  [ rifters are red , merlins are blue ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/2011/10/rifters-are-red-merlins-are-blue-whats.html ) ^ ( tm ), 
   you got a crush on the other hand, 
  this is a common problem for redditors . 
   `` who is going to take this seriously when they pay a prostitute money ? 
  it has absolutely no credibility . '', 
  you tell 'em , craig . 
  i mean , what sort of person would pay a prostitute money ? 
  lots of buildings in the inner city have basements . 
  well , more like refurnished coal cellars .

  90 % cpu , 98 % powergid usage with max skills ( can use overclock rig or swap pdu for mapc if you are short ), 
  feel free to downgrade any of the modules to meta level . 
  rigs are cheap , because : merlin :, 
  fly close , web and apply dps . 
  it 's more recent than the two-year-old posts i found via google . 
  thats why many people suggest creating separate characters for industry-related stuff . 
  probably , but one can always strip the fittings and resell when you upgrade to a bigger ship . 
  alternatively , you can make a decent pvp frigate out of it by swapping, 
  * cap booster out , j5b scram in, 
  * ssb out , medium ancillary booster in ( could fit mse with a rig ), 
  * anti-thermal rig out , overclocking rig in, 
  i read about that happening in the novel * [ sh\u014dgun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sh%c5%8dgun_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) * , but i never thought any of it was historically accurate . 
  i play eve online , so i know this to be untrue . 
  it was mostly done to piggyback on the art department 's workload . 
  it 's just prep work so they can make some more changes down the track . 
  so he ejected from his tengu , tried to board your 'em pty ' carrier but found out someone had locked it up and he could n't get in , then you ninja 'd over in a pod and stole his ride ? 
  think of it as skyrim , but instead of the game developers writing a plot for you to follow , you just [ wander around ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_world ) , doing whatever you want , and meeting other players that will help or hinder you . 
  plus spaceships . 
  check out [ some videos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tr3n9/i_have_literally_been_trying_to_convice_myself_to/c4p01w3 ) that explain it better . 
  this is probably a worthwhile question to ask as a separate thread . 
  231m isk is , what , a single battleship ? 
  they also call masturbation ` having a mastie ' .
