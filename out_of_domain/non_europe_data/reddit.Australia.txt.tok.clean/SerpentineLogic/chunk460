  * if home is empty for 6 months + and not exempt , you pay a tax of 1 % of the valuation ( so $ 7k/year on a $ 700k house ), 
  * if you lie to them about it , the house is automatically deemed to be empty plus fines of ** up to $ 10k per day ** depending on how annoyed they are with you . 
  a grand wizard ? 
  too soon ? 
  sometimes i can , sometimes not . 
  i do n't know why not . 
  i think the prudent thing to do is invest the same amount each year over a long period of time . 
  when the market is up , you cap your expenditure . 
  when the market is down , you get more value . 
  nice . 
  is n't that their fault ? 
  probably the bnestrong guy . 
  almost every poster on / r/bnestrong is actually the same guy on different accounts . 
  or maybe just let the man spend his money how he likes . 
  i think the pm comes out looking pretty good actually . 
  or maybe speaking in the third person is weird , dude . 
  ** edit : ** guys , do n't downvote him , it 's only bantz, 
  jb also do occasionally apple deals , according to their email list . 
  if you 're worried about overexposure , do n't gear so heavily ? 
  my bad, 
  being rich does not mean you 're a bad person and do n't deserve it, 
  imo , who owns wapo is unimportant to the value of what it does , although i accept that others feel differently, 
  actually , yes , giving money to wapo is a * really good move * for journalism . 
  they and the nyt are the frontrunners in quality investigative journalism in the us and they deserve the money they get . 
  they 're trying really hard to stay afloat in a changing world where a lot of news is free , and i hope they are successful . 
   ** how are asx 200 companies selected ? 
   constituents are selected by a committee from standard & poor 's ( s&p ) and the australian securities exchange ( asx ) . 
   all companies listed on the australian securities exchange ( asx ) are ranked by market capitalisation . 
  exchange traded funds ( etfs ) and listed investment companies ( lics ) are ignored . 
  the top 200 asx stocks that meet minimum volume and investment benchmarks then become eligible for inclusion in the index . 
   rebalances are conducted quarterly in march , june , september and december . 
  if a significant event occurs ( e.g. 
  delisting , merger , etc. ), 
  an intra-quarter rebalance may be conducted . 
  a minimum of two business days ' notice is given to the market .

  is it illegal ? 
  then you 're gon na have a tough time , since that 's * actual money laundering * . 
  is it legal but unusual , like sex work or poker winnings or trading pokemon cards ? 
  then maybe we can help . 
  ok , but you 're now in the situation where that is now a problem . 
  your options are, 
  * talk to your boss and agree that you have to go legit from now on , and let bygones be bygones, 
  * throw your boss under the bus to make you retrospectively legit, 
  * suck it up and get a legit job, 
  * deal with being a grey market worker with all that entails, 
  when hsbc did it , there were no repercussions . 
  sort this subreddit by top / all time, 
  state and federal government websites have lots of info for this topic though, 
  no whey . 
  just seems much easier to watch it online, 
  maybe the inala park ? 
  personal services income rules are pretty restrictive though . 
  if op and their husband make a company , the 80/20 rule is solved but the ato will just say `` it 's a company that derives its income from personal services '' and you wo n't get any tax breaks . 
  a company is a great option if you 're a builder or dentist or whatever , but it 's not applicable everywhere . 
  well there 's always twitch cha -, 
  uh , forget i said anything, 
  e 10 is less fuel efficient , so some people prefer it . 
  why not use a small sledgehammer instead ? 
  worked at a bank once where remote work was really encouraged . 
  i think it would have been possible to do full time remotely . 
  which city is closest to where you live ? 
  that 's a side business , not investment . 
  some of those are hilarious . 
  i doubt the ato will prosecute , since her employer paid income tax to them . 
  they probably will insist on her catching up with her returns and doing her taxes from now on . 
  i suggest calling them directly . 
  go to the source . 
  `` of course killing the homeless is a very poor policy , but it has to be compared to no policy on getting people into housing '', 
  no , the worst-case scenario is people doing wftd for free so employers * do n't have to * offer them a job . 
   the ato probably wo n't have records going back that far, 
  note : do not rely on this . 
  it matches his immortal lance . 
  yeah , but batteries and other storage devices soak load , so when your grid produces too much you just store it instead of shedding it . 
  gas generators are great for troughs but do n't do much for smoothing peaks .

  i 'm conflicted . 
  it 's important that landlords get paid , but from what i 've read , poor people need the flexibility to juggle payments because they have no buffer for emergency costs that arise . 
  when you only have bad choices to make , sometimes you need to get behind on rent to pay off a debt that is accruing more interest . 
  i think i 'll approach this with a wait and see attitude , at least until some social welfare experts speak up ( rather than politicians ), 
  from what i 've read , capital growth comes more from land than the building . 
  but , if you can get a * good * discount off the plan , then go for it . 
  bulletproof spectacles . 
  sure , why not . 
  incidentally , jumping is really not a good way to suicide . 
  if you survive ( which happens a lot ) you 'll probably be paralysed . 
  then again , people who jump are not really doing rational cost-benefit analysis at the time ... 
  a lot of suicide attempts are a cry for help . 
  so imagine that you try and fail . 
  you are still depressed, 
  but * now you ca n't move your arms or legs *, 
  it 's a horrible situation to be in . 
  in text form ? 
  not that i know of . 
  i 've talked to a few patients and staff at the pa spinal unit though . 
  from what i saw , the most common reasons to be in there were, 
  * vehicle accidents ( generally dirt bikes ), 
  * accidental diving accidents, 
  * falling injuries , both accidental and deliberate, 
  a safer way would be to buy half soon , and half in 6 months , then continue ( with smaller ) purchases twice-yearly .
