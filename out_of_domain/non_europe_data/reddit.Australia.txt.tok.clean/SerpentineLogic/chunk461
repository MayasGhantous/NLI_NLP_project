  sure , you might miss out on some gains , but you may equally avoid some falls . 
  assuming you 're serious , they get the venom , inject it into a horse , * then * extract compounds from the horse to make antivenin . 
  presumably they reuse the horse for the next batch . 
  as an aussie , [ lol flightless birds ] ( https://www.australiazoo.com.au/our-animals/birds/ratites/cassowary ) . 
  if heroes with escape abilities complain about lack of wards placed , give them some wards to place in dangerous parts of the map . 
  why put anything into vgb ? 
  bonds . 
  it 's not a really good time for bonds ; the bond rate is * well * below the cash rate available via hisas . 
  just look at the bond yield vs what you can get in a hisa . 
  unless you have more than 250k to move around , bonds are clearly suboptimal . 
  bear in mind that you can still have income assets that are n't bonds . 
  like , vif or what ever . 
  um , i 'd read / r/ausfinance for into on which hisa . 
  there are different best ones , depending on lots of factors . 
  what about all the sand which is there . 
  cool . 
  it 's important to know ; stuff like that can help you and those around you avoid a fair bit of financial hardship . 
  take off your slacks and jack it . 
  set up a ( high growth ) managed fund in you or your spouses name but secretly earmarked for her ? 
  probably the easiest way to keep things separate . 
  imo , if you are in a game where a lot of your team is higher mmr than you , you can confidently take pos 4 or 5 because you trust your cores to pull through for you . 
  if you are in a game where the other players are lower mmr than you , it might be time to step up and go pos 1 , 2 or 3 , especially if you play a core that can splitpush while the rest of the team is off doing their own thing . 
  but at the end of the day , communication and teamwork wins games , so regardless of position , you need to be the person providing ** what your team lacks ** . 
  often , this is situational awareness . 
  you need to call missing when roamers disappear . 
  you need to anticipate where they will go next . 
  you need to warn teammates when they 're grossly out of position ( because we all know the guy who pushes the lane too far ) . 
  that 's why kotl is a good support at the scrub tier . 
  * has a spell that pushes lanes , which is often lacking in 1k games, 
  * a support that can farm his own ward money, 
  * mana drain is useful for ganking, 
  * chakra can buff your carry, 
  * aghs provides really good vision for teamfights, 
  * recall lets you yank teammates back into position before they get ganked, 
  he 's squishy as all hell , but that just improves your own positioning , 
  try him in unranked a bit , or watch some vids from good players , like [ og.fly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvah75fpcpq ) or [ purge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a4flbhvqgu ) or something . 
   i do n't have a spouse . 
  is it worth setting up a family trust ? 
  trusts are good to disburse money to spouses and children  18 years of age . 
  i do n't see where you 'd benefit much from one right now . 
  in theory yes , but in practice , if you 're the sole trustee of funds only * you * put in there , it 's not that much safer than a pre nup . 
  once you get to the * top * tax bracket it starts being worth it . 
  probably better to ebay them and donate the money ( or at least the stuff that 's worth decent money ), 
  but if you do n't want to to that , kids units at hospitals are good places to call , and it turns out there 's a [ shitload of foster care homes and orphanages ] ( http://www.clan.org.au/homes/qld ) in the state that would be happy to take them off your hands . 
  so , this explains why opening packs of fantasy player cards is so flashy . 
  so i guess your buy trigger is when $ 1m buys you a non-shitbox property . 
  it 's not just that . 
  most us accents are rhotic , so unless you 're from boston it 's quite difficult to adapt to a non-rhotic accent . 
  there 's also other changes that mean that a yank has to ` loosen their accent ' , * then * ` put on an aussie accent ' . 
  going the other way is much easier - the aussie accent is one that 's very easy to lose permanently , so temporarily putting on a [ different one ] ( https://youtu.be/p6ubsf02lsq?t=72 ) presents less difficulty .

  i thought you got more crit for * taking * more damage . 
  it basically lowers the skill ceiling by giving all players a small chance to kill anyone , regardless of how good an opponent is . 
  personally , i think that 's a valid game design choice to make , even if i do n't necessarily agree with it . 
  \\ #justaustraliathings, 
  glhf, 
   well played !, 
  mid or i feed, 
  also , shout out to / r/dotavods for collating all the videos so you do n't get rekt by timezones, 
  generally if you rock up with six figures they 'll say yes . 
  but remember that the more indexes you follow , the more transactions you need to do . 
  not just adding to your holdings , but selling off when they drift above your target range . 
  clearly this is a 457 visa situation . 
  depends on your disposable income . 
  but probably not if you 're starting out in dota and this late in the ti season . 
  imagine a basketball computer game , except there 's no ball , the players are wizards and the first team to destroy the enemy hoop is the winner . 
  i 'll still take my dad for a test drive next time he 's in town . 
  i mean , 130k is only 5 months pay for a doctor . 
  like a new south welshman , you bleed blue ? 
  6.5 % excludes fees or not ? 
  plug it into a power socket , or rock up to a fast charging station , which is usually one at each tesla shop , and sprinkled across the country . 
  neither does a game of ability draft , but it 's still fun as hell . 
  probably could get cheaper internet via [ myrepublic ] ( https://myrepublic.net/au/personal/nbn/pricing/ ) ? 
  imo 25 % savings rate is pretty good for a $ 54k salary . 
  aftershock is only 300 radius though . 
  fair enough . 
  myr does 100/40 unlimited for $ 60 but if you get phone discounts it might not be worth switching . 
  ofc there might be better phone , electricity , rego deals out there too ... 
   building a small business in food, 
  actually sounds like switching jobs , not retiring . 
  i mean , you 'll still need to work at that food business , and presumably it will make a profit ? 
  like sand, 
  i 'm pretty sure there 'll be a place nearby to set up shop tho . 
  doom and underlord are similar ; tanky melee aura carriers . 
  doom has more sustain and jungles better , but ul does better laning due to creeps dying around him . 
  once he gets mana , ul can take stacks like a boss . 
  doom 's kit is more focused on deleting one enemy in particular ; ul is more about area control and damage . 
  i would n't shell the lead creep , it does first . 
  better shell the second creep , or even shell their creeps because they ca n't get rid of it so easily . 
  note that you can shell an enemy , then vacuum them . 
  mise well get that magic damage in while they 're clumped up . 
  each win rate % above 50 gives you +50 mmr per hundred games played .
