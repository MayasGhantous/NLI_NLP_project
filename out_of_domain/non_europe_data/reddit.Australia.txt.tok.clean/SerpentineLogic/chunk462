  so , 55 % is still good . 
  it 's * not a competition *, 
  the thought of 40 % of my wealth tied to two companies would horrify me . 
  but you do you . 
  if you 're not confident of your ability to 1 v 1 a lane , maybe avoid mid ? 
  rip eating shellfish, 
  spend a * lot * of effort skilling up for a 90k job . 
  most of australia has low carbon soil . 
  increasing soil carbon would be great here . 
  yeah , it was going to be the model e before someone tapped elon on the shoulder, 
  to date , your biggest investments are, 
  * property 1, 
  * property 2, 
  * bank that makes most of its money from loans for property, 
  it might be prudent to direct new investments elsewhere than property . 
  probably need to choose different angles . 
  shares are popular , but there are cash based investments like term deposits etc. 
  an etf just means it 's a mutual fund that you can easily buy into via a stockbroker . 
  vanguard operates some famous etfs . 
  sort this subreddit by top of all time . 
  should help . 
  i 'd be tempted to put the first year into long term investment , 75 % of the second years etc , so the last 2 years are cash based only . 
  but that might not be palatable to many . 
   i think oil is at the ** bottom ** of a structural cycle . 
   i think i 'll buy all of these in the ** next ** crash . 
  oil makes a lot of plastics . 
  the same reason people from boston call things wicked , or someone from western sydney calls things sick . 
   fortunately we pay those in charge of the most formative years a fortune to attract the best and brightest . 
  / ssing so hard right now, 
  it opened up my eyes, 
   would going for vas and vgs make tax time simpler, 
  yes . 
   but also decrease my expose and potential gains ? 
  only * very * slightly . 
   i want any gains to be reinvested in more etfs , and i wo n't be selling anything for a while . 
  well , vgs has dividend reinvestment , so that helps . 
  `` let 's model the roads off this concept village in germany . 
  surely people will enjoy walking around in the 45 degree heat to get to the next street over instead of driving . '', 
  well in some situations i might recommend peer to peer lending like rate setter , since the 1 month returns are pretty decent , but it 's not something i 'd be comfortable using large sums of money in , especially for long terms . 
  doing csgo this month , i think . 
  whatever the gst limit is ( i forget whether it 's 75k income or 75k worth of gst ) , it 's mandatory above the limit , but optional below the limit . 
  so you can still do it . 
  between you and your wife , you should aim to save 50 % of your income . 
  this means one of you can lose your job/take perental leave/whatever while the other person holds the fort , in addition to all the other perks of having more money . 
  ok , so calibration is done ; there 's nothing you can do about that now . 
  your goal should be on improving as a player , and that will be reflected in your win rate . 
  a 55 % win rate means you will go up +250 mmr every 100 games ; you just need to keep at it . 
  it is what it is . 
  i calibrated at 1.1 k , but i can hardly complain when others calibrate at 3.1 k ; they 're clearly much better players than me . 
  anyone under 1.5 k is in the bottom 10 % of all dota players . 
  you just got ta move on from that and focus on improving . 
  cmc allows you to pay on margin with leveraged , which is backed by bendigo bank . 
  just bpay into the leveraged account first if you do n't want to use the margin loan itself . 
  yeah but lol pro players get money directly from riot so it 's a different revenue stream . 
  dota2 is a lot more about the tournaments and independent revenue streams like twitch streaming . 
  some of the chinese streamers are pulling in high six figures by streaming ; to the point where chinese audiences accused them of phoning in the tournaments because they did n't really care about the prize money . 
  it 's not that bad ... 
  stats do n't lie ( much ) . 
  well , the $ 4m prize is only for [ second place ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/the_international/2017#main_event ) .

  depends on your tax bracket . 
  if you 're < 80k it 's much less worth it compared to  180k . 
  also depends on your profile and goals . 
  if you 're 40 and own your own home , then you have different priorities compared to someone in their 20s who is looking to purchase a house in the next few years . 
  the 40-year old is both closer to retirement , and has a reduced need for cash outside of super ( or rather , the house represents a big chunk of wealth already ), 
  on the other hand it 's a guaranteed tax break , and it 's capped at a reasonable amount so you ca n't go completely overboard . 
  note that the super limit is shared with compulsory contributions , so if you 're on a $ 100k salary , $ 9.5 k is already gone from your cap . 
  as far as i 'm aware , all your profit counts as capital gains ( aside from the tax you paid each year while you had it ), 
  soul ring and harass with spells ? 
  just arrow the hard camp a lot . 
  a head dress should be sufficient , or even just shrine once or twice . 
  play storm or tinker . 
  in fact , play most mids . 
  you 're off lane . 
  build vlads . 
  some people have genes that are very sensitive to nutrition when growing up . 
  others are n't . 
  step 1 is to put it in a high interest savings account while you decide . 
  ** each 1 % ** bonus interest compared to your normal bank account will earn you $ 1500/year , so do n't delay . 
  as far as managed investments go , yes you can definitely put it into a managed fund or do it yourself, 
  ** but **, 
  remember that most investments are not * capital stable * ; i.e. 
  one year they may be up , and the next year they may be down . 
  this means that if you need the money on a certain date when the market is down , you might end up with shit returns . 
  hisa are capital stable but provide maybe 3 % returns , which is on the low side compared to other types of investments . 
  as far as managed funds go , shop around . 
  vanguard does have managed funds , and the wholesale funds are generally better value . 
  you may find other providers like magellan suit you better though . 
  for the international/domestic split , i think they offer diversified funds , so `` high growth '' has a mix of international , domestic , property , the works . 
  that 's a deliberate decision taken by the south hedland city council to not grant more development requests . 
  they knew it was a boom and did n't want to be left with derelict homes in 5 years time . 
  you 're missing the chance that your etf gives negative returns after 12 months . 
  which does n't happen for term deposits . 
  solar halberd works . 
  have someone build euls or atos or something for control , and be sure to have force staffs for escaping when he pops bkb,

  job market is fine ; getting the skilled work visa is the hard part . 
  yeah i guess it 's more sensational left rather than hardcore left .
