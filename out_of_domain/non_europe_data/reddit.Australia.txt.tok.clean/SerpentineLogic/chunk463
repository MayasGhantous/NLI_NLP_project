  * come prepared with healing ( salves , urn , mek etc ) so your team does n't back off after a fight, 
  * buy pushing items ( blight , basilius , drums , dominator , necro ), 
  * choose a hero who can push by themselves, 
  danny gaming does commentary while he plays , and tries to predict what will happen next . 
  so you work there for a couple of years to get some prestige then leave . 
  maybe not unfair , but even 1k players are more difficult than hard bots . 
  normal pub matches still have mmr ; it 's just that it 's hidden from the players themselves . 
  wins and losses still adjust your rating . 
   do you think i am relatively safe to start investing now ? 
  if it does n't go ahead , will you be upset that you sal-sacced say , 15k per year into super instead of having it available for a deposit ? 
  if yes , do n't do it .

  idk , you got out drafted , it will be hard . 
   they will buy from the same high-priced local distributors as everyone else, 
  i strongly doubt that . 
  amazon does not * produce * a lot of things , but it 's better at supply chain and wholesaling than anyone in the country , so that 's where it will make the most impact . 
  note : you can only get this visa * once * . 
  make the most of it . 
  well there 's the 457 temporary skilled worker visa . 
  not sure whether your desired role is on the list though , and that visa is tied to your employer so it 's short term . 
  not immediately , but i bet it 's on amazon 's 3-year plan . 
  is it important that it be a savings account ? 
  i ask because there are lots of managed funds that you can open in their name , and since it 's mostly capital gains , they wo n't pay tax the way they would on the interest ( at low amounts it does n't matter , but the tax brackets for kids are brutal if you go over the tiny tax free threshold ), 
  [ :\\ ( ] ( https://twitter.com/cancelismo_/status/898502397324087296 ), 
  well , that 's a very personal question to ask . 
  vanguard has retail funds with eftpos facilities , as does magellan , platinum , black rock etc. 
   i would n't personally recommend most tablets . 
  surface pros are pretty good though . 
  within a managed fund ( or a diy portfolio ) , assets are classed as growth or income ( they may be classified in many other ways too , but just go with it ), 
  growth assets are * intended * to be worth more over time ( and * may * give income ) . 
  growth assets are great in the long term , but do n't provide much money in the mean time . 
  income assets are * intended * to give you dollars ( and * may * give you growth ) . 
  they provide a fairly steady stream of money , but without growth , it wo n't keep up with inflation . 
  generally , a fund will have an asset mix containing some of both types . 
  generally it goes something like, 
  * high growth : 90 % + growth, 
  * growth : 70 % growth, 
  * balanced : 50 % growth, 
  * conservative : 30 % or less growth, 
  what he was saying is that whatever investment vehicle you use , choose the right mix of growth and income . 
  the buckets idea is that you set up two investment buckets . 
  one for pre retirement and one for post retirement . 
  they might have different asset mixes , because retirement might be 8 years away and you do n't want to miss out on growth , but you 're more conservative with your pre retirement assets . 
  or vice versa , idk . 
  you miss 100 % of the shots you do n't take, 
  no , but i 'm probably not the target market . 
  on the other hand , acorns does this and people appear to like it . 
  i think there used to be a suncorp account that did the same thing . 
  no , it was just a really good pavilion . 
  hot pink being invented from coal was a surprise . 
  of course it 's how * he * sees it . 
  what else do you expect him to write ? 
  aim high . 
  not just $ 70 , go for $ 1000 . 
  a grand grant , if you will . 
  that 's a reasonable opinion to hold ; however that 's * not * what you wrote about . 
  i would never virtue signal . 
  my mates at the soup kitchen i volunteer at would never let me hear the end of it . 
  let 's be fair ; the sda was set up that way in the 50 's . 
  it 's not as if joe took it * over * . 
  it has a touch of humble brag to it . 
  he 's saying `` i have enough money to retire * without * needing this 220k in super '' \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   printing money should cause inflation . 
  only if the currency is free to fluctuate . 
  if it 's , say , [ pegged ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/030616/why-chinese-yuan-pegged.asp ) , then that option is not available . 
   bill shorten somehow made the coalition members stupid and careless . 
  `` it 's labor 's fault for not stopping us . '', 
  i do n't care about them losing money ; that 's on them . 
  what 's relevant is reducing unwanted market distortions to an acceptable level . 
  most insurance companies will be happy to help . 
  however , it 's important to get advice from at least 2 different providers , since you do n't have the experience to tell whether the first person you talk to is full of shit or not . 
  imo , life insurance is best used to pay off loans so your spouse is n't left with house repayments if you get killed . 
  it 's a lump sum payment , and your super may cover this . 
  income protection and/or trauma/tpd is expensive but important for situations where you , e.g. 
  get into a life-changing accident but * do n't * die . 
  it happens a lot more than you think , and if it happens to you , it can ruin your entire family ; you , your spouse , your parents - all of them are affected if you suddenly, 
  * ca n't bring in income by working ** and **, 
  * need someone else to care for you, 
  so having an ongoing payment can really help . 
  plus , ip insurance is tax-deductible , so putting it into super is not as attractive . 
  i guess this means lich falls off even harder now ?

  that 's a special kind of twisted . 
   the study is legitimate in that it exists . 
  that 's not what legitimate means .

   apparently these posters have been appearing round america for the last few months . 
  wonder why .
