  i code . 
  it scratches my itch to design and build things . 
  some people build model trains . 
  i build apis in the cloud . 
   immediately after my emergency fund has finished , i 'll bump up my super contribution to a ) minimise taxable income , b ) increase super for future-me . 
  tbh while it 's a nice perk , i would n't go * nuts * over salary sac into super . 
  you ca n't access it until retirement , so you need to balance your assets available now vs then . 
  currently , 100 % of your investment money is going into super . 
  perhaps that could be adjusted downward to free up some money for investing directly . 
  well there 's aston kucher 's group :, 
   is my current 10 % of my salary considered nuts ? 
  at what point should i start thinking more seriously about it ? 
  10 % of your salary goes into `` savings + investments '' . 
  that 's a fairly low percentage , but you 're also on a fairly low salary . 
  i would expect that when you get pay rises , that most of that extra money would be saved rather than increasing your expenditure . 
  i imagine at a certain point you 'll be saving 50 % of your take-home . 
   what do you mean 100 % of my investment money is going into super ? 
  of that 10 % of your salary that you have earmarked for investment , the * whole lot * is going into super . 
  what i 'm saying is that it might be a better idea to split that money up - some goes into super , and some goes into investments outside of super . 
  personally , i 'd put a bit into super but not a huge amount . 
  like $ 20-50 per week . 
  either way , it 's much better to do things that will increase your employment prospects . 
  getting $ 65k instead of $ 45k automatically means an extra $ 1900/year going into super , on top of everything else . 
  from what i understand , firetoad started banning his alts too , so he got the message . 
  started in brissie . 
  so , diversify . 
  if you really want the home loan experience , take out a 900k loan to buy stocks . 
  they 're different things . 
  opening an account with vanguard directly gives you access to their * retail * funds . 
  having a brokerage account gives you access to their * exchange traded * funds , which their retail funds are built from . 
  etfs allow you to make a diy retail style fund for cheap . 
  we do n't even have to wait for 100 % hands free driverless . 
  teslas already beep loudly if they think you 're about to have an accident , which would have prevented this from happening . 
  from what i gather , the export version tastes like crown lager . 
  that would be plausible , if we played beer pong in the * first place * . 
  people do have weddings in the registry office ( near the treasury ) . 
  it 's not as common here compared to how often it shows up in american movies . 
  til, 
   i 've noticed that the skill level of players are the same from 1-3k, 
  maybe mid lane like a 3k player , but every other aspect is 500mmr , and that 's why you lose . 
  win percentage is everything . 
  it 's got me hooked . 
  i 'm enjoying clinks in the 1k bracket . 
  invisible = invincible , and he can gank and drop towers . 
  that feature was removed from the client . 
  you ca n't bind multiple commands to one key anymore . 
  it means that if the company goes broke , you still own the shares . 
  `` many sides , many sides '', 
  online , probably . 
  welp, 
  mine 's polarised in a way that blocks it when it 's landscape , but is fine in portrait . 
  one plus 1, 
  discreet is the correct word . 
  also , paying off the mortgage means you can get the equity out to invest later ; it 's not lost forever . 
  the important thing is to not risk more than you can afford to lose . 
  for most people , that means they do n't risk more than 10-15 % of their portfolio on ultra-high-risk assets - that way , if they lose the lot , it sets them back a couple of years , but does n't wipe them out entirely . 
  250k in super is a good target to aim for . 
  having less than that will make for a much less enjoyable retirement . 
  little steps . 
  and yes , 250k assumes aged pension afterwards . 
  now that you mention it , i really do n't know . 
  i probably should , though . 
  there 's lots of alternatives , including the popular concept of `` early-to-mid-stage capitalism '', 
  considered orchid ? 
  attack speed , combos well with nukes , great mana sustain for when there 's no creeps nearby , is built from the quarterstaff that you get when disassembling mask of madness , and has an upgrade path that includes crits . 
  look at the average mmr of the team ( in this case , 1164 ), 
  look at the * top * mmr player of your team, 
  subtract one from the other . 
  this is the mmr spread for the game, 
  your mmr is * at least * [ average - spread ], 
  to be a successful angel investor , you need to bring something to the table to help your investment succeed - otherwise they will choose another angel investor and you 'll only get the dregs that are left . 
  you could join [ a group ] ( http://www.brisbaneangels.com.au/index.html ) of like-minded people , to see what 's up . 
  alternatively , there are bound to be mutual funds where the management do the angel investing using fund members ' ... funds . 
  that 's how people are investing in private companies like spacex - they can only have a few dozen shareholders before they 're forced to go public , but if one shareholder is a mutual fund representing a bunch of people , that 's perfectly okay with them ; they just deal with the fund instead . 
  dick smith electronics wrote off a bunch of stock , then sold it cheap to pad the books ... 
  unless you have raindrops, 
  sounds like you 're terrible at shitposting, 
  there are other options than * property * - there are many high-yield * stock * funds that generate income . 
   do n't know if i can amass $ 400k in super in 20 years from $ 100k now . 
  so you have 20 years to accumulate $ 300k ( ignoring growth , but also ignoring inflation ), 
  that 's 15k per year ( after taxes ) . 
  assuming you contribute via salary sacrifice or claim tax deduction , that means you need to contribute ~ $ 17.7 k gross . 
  you already get 9.5 % from your employer , so assuming you 're on $ 90k salary , you need to basically match whatever your employer contributes ( 9.5 % of 90k = 8.5 k ) . 
  fast enough to reply to jokes on irc before the moment has passed . 
   are my calculations correct or have i messed something up ? 
  you have . 
  that $ 10k that billy contributed took $ 16400 of his pre-tax income . 
  so , $ 16400 pre-tax, 
  -  $ 10000 after-tax, 
  then, 
  $ 10000 into super, 
  -  get $ 3900 back from ato, 
  summary : $ 12500 pre-tax turns into $ 10k of super . 
  note that , long term , this might be better than the regular way , which is :, 
  sal sac $ 11760/year into super, 
  - 15 % tax = $ 1760, 
  -  $ 10000 into super, 
  so you get 6 % better value initially , but since you paid with pre-tax money , you may * still * have to pay tax as it comes out ( currently this is your normal marginal rate minus 10 percentage points , or something like that ), 
  depends what you do . 
   it would take way too many tutorials to cover all the aspects in the game .
