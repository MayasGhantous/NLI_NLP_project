  well , australians are in general fairly unfamiliar with both those things , so there 's a degree of novelty meeting someone who might now more . 
  and when it comes to politics and health care , it 's basically a macabre sense of curiosity at play . 
  no chance of * being * king , but gets to * choose * the king . 
  surprised you did n't mention the lib/nat coalition - it 's the longest and most-influential alliance in australian history . 
   lib/nat is one that is pretty much considered the same party almost, 
  . . which is one thing i do n't understand about that arrangement . 
  in the last 5-10 years , the libs have consistently passed laws that adversely impacted rural areas ( the nbn scale-back and climate change/renewable energy laws being most prominent ) so it 's kinda puzzling that the coalition is actually tight at all . 
  but that 's a discussion more relevant in / r/australia than here i guess . 
  i believe the correct term is state capitalism .

  the half-life of a programmer is fifteen years . 
  at age 35 , half your peers will be doing something else ; at 50 , three quarters wo n't be coding . 
  that does n't mean you wo n't be involved in software development ; it 's just that at a certain point , you need to leverage your experience to make more of a difference than you could get a way with as a junior . 
  this means being the person who stops mistakes before they happen - either as a project manager , a solution analyst or architect , or a team lead in charge of a bunch of onshore and offshore coders , you will be a force multiplier instead of another body . 
  sure , no problem .

  i 'm pretty sure this guy is just a troll instead . 
  missed it by many years . 
  even those ` kid saver ' style accounts that you can open for a 12 year old are in the kid 's name ; the kid just has less access than the guardian does . 
  they convert to a real account when the kid turns 18 , and the guardian access is removed . 
  only vain enough to have an instagram account . 
  rich 50 is poor person 's 38 . 
  so it makes sense that he looks 12 years younger than his real age . 
  in areas that raffwu does n't operate , they recommend united voice instead .

   thanks dude i went for like two weeks and just struggle to prioritise it .

  say you have an investment property . 
  or shares . 
  or a racehorse idk . 
  just something that generates income . 
  if your parents own it , the income is charged at their marginal rate . 
  but if they give it to their kids , they lose control . 
  so , a family trust is created to hold that income-generating asset , where the parents are in control . 
  all the income must be distributed every year , but it 's fine to spread it around between ( non-child ) family members to make best use of tax free thresholds and achieve a better tax result . 
  works so far . 
  4 times a week like clockwork .

  why not uba ? 
   uba provides a diversified core exposure to the australian equity market and aims to replicate the performance of the msci australia ex tobacco ex controversial weapons index , before fees and expenses by physically holding the shares within the underlying index, 
  well then you choose an index that only includes stocks that return a certain level of dividends , like vhy .

  pro tip : next time , tell them to use the thinnest needle they have . 
  slower blood draw means reduced chance of syncope , although the draw takes longer . 
  when would you need to cash out ? 
  if it 's soon , then a bank account is best . 
  if not , then shares are a lot easier to partially sell compared to direct property . 
  as far as shares go , a conservative option is to diversify into a few markets . 
  some shares in australia , some shares internationally etc. 
  i thought import gst was always payable , but below a certain amount they just wo n't bother enforcing it . 
  accurate and detailed statistics on this topic have existed for decades .
