  oh , the faction modules . 
  * shadow serpentis armor explosive hardener : [ 7.5 m isk ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=14061&amp;usesystem=30000142 ), 
  * true sansha energized em membrane : [ 350k isk ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=14090&amp;usesystem=30000142 ), 
  if that 's too pricey , you can drop down to an armor explosive hardener ii and centii c-type em plating : [ 400k isk ] ( http://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=18722&amp;usesystem=30000142 ), 
  your resists will drop a bit , from, 
  but it 's survivable . 
  it has an explosive hardener already . 
  blasters are better and easier to fit . 
  null is better . 
  hybrid ammo reload is faster . 
  gallente ships are faster . 
  looks good , although i 'd be tempted to plug in some genolution and/or squire implants to see if i could upgrade that electron blaster . 
  electrons really are terrible . 
  eve online is quite realistic in that regard . 
  jobs was more of a narcissist than a sociopath . 
  tormentor is basically a tech 1 slicer . 
  for minmatar faction warfare , i suggest checking out some of the corps in [ late night ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/late%20night%20alliance/corporations ) . 
  u jelly ? 
   why kill snakes ? 
  i 'm from australia : home of the top eight deadliest snakes in the world . 
  er , yes ? 
  but it 's also not a ` standard frigate ' .

  as if you login , 
  no , but i read [ the blog ] ( http://www.gamerchick.net/2012/05/7-reasons-to-join-faction-war-post.html ) . 
  i ca n't point you to the relevant [ know your enemy ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/p/article-index.html ) page because azual has been slack and has n't written it yet , 
  oh well , here goes . 
  most missioners use the obvious raven -  cnr -  golem progression but i respect your hipsterism for choosing the scorp model . 
  that leaves the scorp navy issue ( sni ) or the rattlesnake . 
  both are stupidly tanky , but the sni has 6 bonused launchers while the rattler has 4 unbonused ones ( although it has a range bonus that lends itself to torps ) . 
  the rattler also has a large drone bay and bandwidth for five heavy or sentry drones . 
  historically , the drone damage from the rattlesnake has n't been enough to make up for the lack of launchers , but the addition of drone damage modules may push this over the line , since the rattler has an extra two low slots to put them in . 
  drones in missions do have issues with aggression which you may find annoying . 
  ** tldr ; ** they 're both decent , if you like drones go rattlesnake , if you like missiles go sni ( or cnr ), 
  here 's a fit i stole from battleclinic then hacked up :,

  yeah , domination bcss , whatever . 
  torp dps is 387 , drone dps is ** 711 ** . 
  it 's a weird ship , but it 's a lot better since inferno was released . 
  nice guide . 
  it even has graphs !, 
  this would n't have happened if hydra and outbreak had n't pissed all over ccp during the last match in at 9 . 
  they could have made the last match an entertaining fight , even though it was rigged , but no , they had to ruin the pr value of the entire match . 
  and if there 's one thing that ccp is sensitive to , it 's bad publicity . 
  sure is . 
  rattlesnake torps are about 30km , which is not terrible . 
  i think there 's enough calibration on the above fit to sneak in a missile + velocity rig . 
  intentions do n't matter . 
  outcomes do . 
  how can you still expect the benefit of the doubt ?
