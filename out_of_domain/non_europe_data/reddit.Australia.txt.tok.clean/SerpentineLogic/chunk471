  that 's okay , he can just switch to using globalist instead . 
  i had that dilemma , but decided to repair mine after looking at reviews of my old one vs the new models . 
  the new models were rated a lot lower due to mechanical issues so i noped right out and got the repairman in .

  if you bully a colleague behind his back on social media and he finds out , you have opened them up to a law suit ... 
  unless they have this policy that says not to . 
  then you 're on your own . 
  imo this streets thing is above and beyond reasonable , though . 
  so here i am , sorting by controversial and eating popcorn, 
  it 's time to stop posting . 
  guardian greaves purges off dust , so there 's that . 
  maybe someone should go on / r/askhistorians and ask why it worked for germany and japan but not the south .

   it 's not unlikely for an aboriginal person to marry a british person , move to britain and hence be british . 
  historically , no . 
  indigenous australians could n't get passports until the late 60 's . 
  before then , the only way they 'd get to britain would be as freak show/zoo exhibits . 
  and because it 's split into two damage instances , they wo n't get full value from raindrops until you skill frost blast to 3 . 
  there 's townships east of woomera now . 
  it was a great place to launch stuff away from prying eyes in the 50s and 60s , but not worth it any more . 
  also , the space shuttle program was deliberately spread out between all the mainland states , just to get across-the-board buy in . 
  everyone got their turn at the feeding trough , and that 's one reason why the cost ballooned . 
  no ` technical ' about it .

  the key tenets of keynesian government policy is :, 
  * cushion recessions to avoid them spiralling out of control, 
  * curb excessive booms to avoid them spiralling into bubbles, 
  so if rudd had not preemptively stimulated the economy , then he would have done the same thing a year later anyway . 
   a centrist market regulated capitalism with a government sector and social security works fine . 
  okay , so since the country 's economy has drifted away from the economic centre over the last few years , which direction does it need to head to get back there ? 
  oh , that 's right . 
  it needs a, 
   leftist bent, 
  it appears you 're working under a different set of assumptions in this conversation .

   the way it 's supposed to work is that the drones do their best to make it back before the ship, 
   emergency warps , if they are too far away or being webbed by crafty enemies , they 'll simply get, 
   left behind . 
  ships wo n't postpone emergency warp to wait for drones . 
   the change is n't intended to save all drones but to decrease the number of annoying drone losses . 
   it sort of makes sense that machines as complex as these would have sufficient ai to attempt to, 
   stick with their master : smile :,

   wait , so ... let me get this straight . 
  lets say im 20km away from my sentries , and i decide to, 
   warp off from where i am . 
  will they just appear in my drone bay ? 
   if so , you just made the ishtar viable for sniping . 
  if not , then meh . 
   any drones in space when you get forced into an emergency warp ( ** this does n't happen for **, 
   ** normal warping ** ) will attempt to return to your drone bay as though you issued the command, 
   yourself . 
  if they are too far away , or your ship can align and warp out before they get back ,, 
   you 'll leave them behind . 
   unforgiven storm wrote :, 
   why not ? 
  why not make this a new option for drones , were when i warp out they try to return, 
   to my ship before i warp ? 
  what is the argument for not to do it also in normal warp outs ? 
   i made the same argument , but there are some razor thin edge cases to consider like `` i might, 
   have survived if my ecm drones had n't recalled while i aligned for warp '' , which kind of, 
   necessitates a new drone setting which ultimately ended up being deemed out of scope for the, 
   task at hand . 
   but fear not , i went out of my way to make it easy to revisit easily later . 
  the functionality itself, 
   is just a flag to set when warping that , at the moment , only e-warp sets .

  i see mentions of renters and pets , but i 'm not sure about the distinction . 
  i spent some time in the northern coalition , and some alliances were insultingly referred to as pets , yet seemed to have their own pets oh god it 's turtles * all the way down *, 
  what 's the difference between them , and are there benefits to being one vs the other ? 
  do certain alliances have a preference towards one type or the other , and if so , why ? 
  is there a site that provides a guide for all the units ? 
  the three hundred unit types is pretty daunting . 
  thinking of getting some photovoltaic thingies on my roof . 
  can anyone recommend a good installer and/or non-terrible pv equipment to get installed ?
