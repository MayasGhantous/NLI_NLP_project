  you might need a 3 % implant if your skills are lower . 
  this fit deals 199 dps out to 26km ( 248dps @ 17.5 km with navy ) , so orbit/keep at range 20km or so and plink away until they die . 
  if your missile range skills are n't good enough , just fit a second range rig instead of the flare catalyst . 
  it kills dead anything bigger than a frigate . 
  do n't use in ded complexes .
