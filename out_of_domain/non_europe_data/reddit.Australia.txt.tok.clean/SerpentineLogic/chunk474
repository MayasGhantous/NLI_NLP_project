  tinfoil away . 
  downtime has been creeping down sharply over the last few patches ; tonight was eleven minutes . 
  nice one , ccp . 
  every time they change the control system , i fail at dust for the next week :(, 
  so , i have some 40k rpg books :, 
  * dark heresy, 
  * purge the unclean, 
  * disciples of the dark gods, 
  * gm screen + gm kit, 
  * the inquisitor 's handbook, 
  * dead stars, 
  * ascension, 
  * damned cities, 
  * tattered fates, 
  * the radical 's handbook, 
  the deal is this : you [ buy a goat ] ( https://www.oxfamunwrapped.com.au/gift/94/goat ) from oxfam unwrapped , and i 'll give you the books . 
  you can give the card to anyone you want . 
  i just do n't want to give them away free only to see them show up on ebay a week later . 
  at least this way , some poor african got a goat out of the deal . 
  have n't seen the bot post in almost 2 weeks . 
  http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/evewho.com implies it 's down for everyone :(, 
  preferably relatively close to sunnybank ( if i need to drive to logan , it better be * stellar * ), 
  +10 % bonus to pg/cpu cost of cloak field per level . 
  5 % reduction to cloak field cooldown per level . 
  5 % reduction to firing cloak cost per level . 
  +5 % to dropsuit scan radius and 5 % reduction to scan profile per level . 
  +5 % to melee and nova knife damage per level . 
  sounds suspiciously like you can shoot while cloaked . 
  not sure if i like that . 
  i ask because i ~ ~ have ~ ~ ( had ) a templar bpo pack to sell , but if there 's a better place to put it , i 'll post there instead . 
  i 'm mindful that we could get spammed a bit if it happens a lot , but i 'm also aware that there 's not a lot that can actually be traded easily so perhaps it 's a non-issue . 
  ( i looked in / r/dust514 _ ads but it appears to be corp recruitment ), 
  ### what is vote match ###, 
  vote match is the trusted website run by dierdra vaal since the csm4 election which matches up users to csm candidates that most closely match their opinions and views on eve after filling in a questionnaire about the game . 
  this year he will be extending his site to cover the dust 514 cpm elections . 
  however , ** we need your help ** in compiling a list of questions . 
  the format we are using works best with multiple choice . 
  each candidate can only choose one answer per question , which forces them to have an opinion . 
  for more details on how the site works , please visit : [ url ] http://match.eve-csm.com/faq.php#about, 
  ( sadly the questions have been wiped from last year , so you can not try it out yourself ) . 
  example question and suggested answers :, 
   q : what is your position on skill respecs ? 
  never, 
  only one final time once all racial suits have been added to the game, 
  able to purchase respecs for aur , but pre-nerfed ( limited use , lose sp , high cost , etc ), 
  able to purchase respecs for aur , no limits, 
  able to purchase for isk , no limits, 
  so , if you 'd like to submit a question that you want the cpm to answer , plus some multiple-choice answers , go to this forum thread and make your voice heard . 
  passive booster = 84k / week, 
  2m sp = 24 weeks, 
  i do n't know whether that means that skill point boosters are a waste of money , or whether it just means that ccp does n't want dust to become pay2win and thus charges a lot of money for anything that smacks of p2w , or both . 
  suddenly , 3.5 m sp unallocated \\ o /, 
  and i 'm spent . 
  ^ \\ ( this ^ also ^ goes ^ for ^ the ^ recall ^ program ), 
  the buddy program has been going for a while , essentially unchanged since the last tweak ( adding a personalised url to spam instead of needing an email address to send an invite ), 
  if you were in charge , what would you change , and why ? 
  jester is a member of eve 's council of stellar management ( the eve version of the cpm ) and has this to say about the whole dust debacle :, 
   let me be blunt . 
  in my not so humble opinion , the announcement for this change was done in the most self-serving and cynical way possible . 
  it announces what is essentially the death of the existing dust 514 in front of a friendly eve audience primed to react joyously for the press in attendance . 
  it answered no questions whatsoever from the existing player base and in fact avoided those questions . 
  the short presentation was tilted in such a way that any angry mutterings that might have started would not have time to take root ; the whole thing was over in 37 minutes . 
   hell , when the thing ended , hundreds of people in the auditorium looked around at each other clearly asking `` is that it ? 
  is it over ? '', 
   ^ and ^ as ^ an ^ aside , ^ if ^ anything ^ proves ^ that ^ the ^ nda ^ works ^ and ^ that ^ eve ^ and ^ dust ^ players ^ bound ^ to ^ it ^ will ^ keep ^ ccp 's ^ secrets ^ no ^ matter ^ what ^ those ^ are , ^ this ^ is ^ it . 
   today during the ccp presents keynote , ccp rouge was not scheduled to present . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  look at the `` tale of four keynotes '' slide that came up during every keynote , including today 's . 
  he was n't on it for the last one . 
  but he did get called forward to present , on the two very important topics i raised in my blog post this morning :, 
  does project legion mean the death of dust 514 on the ps3 ? 
  will ps3 players be given the option of migrating their characters to the pc version ? 
   rouge got up on stage and answered both questions clearly and concisely . 
  to the first , he said no . 
  development of dust 514 on ps3 will not be halted . 
  to the second , he said yes . 
  ps3 players will get some kind of migration path . 
   so , the correct things were said . 
  now ccp has to implement and i 'm sure the implementation will be many weeks and months in the making .
