  edit : spreadsheet with changes, 
  so , i have a corp. . well , not * just * me ; there 's a few dozen of us . 
  it 's full of blueprints , most of which do n't get used . 
  that 's just wasteful , so i 'm looking for people to use them . 
  ** tldr ; **, 
  * caldari-based, 
  * ** manufacturers ** :, 
  * advanced mass production i +, 
  * ** inventors **, 
  * advanced laboratory operation i +, 
  ** we provide **, 
  * newbie-friendly ( well , not * un * friendly ) environment, 
  * all personal profits are yours, 
  * well-researched standard blueprints . 
  i 'm not claiming to have everything , but we have decent coverage, 
  * well-researched capital and t2 component blueprints : saves you needing 12 billion isk to start making capital ships, 
  * a tower or two for manufacturing or research at increased rates , or ore compression if you like that kind of thing, 
  * corpmates with high standings if you need ore refined for you . 
  * * occasional * mining support , but we 're not a mining corp. 
  * access to friendly null sec if you want , for ratting or mining in relative peace . 
  ** you provide **, 
  * api key according to [ this config ] ( https://support.eveonline.com/api/key/createpredefined/61607755 ), 
  * an email address for alliance forums, 
  * materials to make or invent whatever you want, 
  * a willingness to decide for yourself what to build , instead of us telling you what ( we will guide new players , but we 're not interested in being your internet-spaceship boss ), 
  * an application to corp that demonstrates your ability to string together a coherent sentence, 
  ** about us **, 
  ** setenta corp ** is one of the oldest corporations in new eden , being formed just one day after the eve cluster was opened to capsuleers . 
  we have been involved in many of the great wars that have shaped eve 's history , both in an industrial and combat capacity . 
  in recent years , setenta has returned to its roots as a research corporation building weapons of war for discriminating customers . 
  public channel : ** stc-public ** or message me here . 
   hello again ,, 
   so we have done a range pass and a dps pass on rifles before , and now that we have collected a lot of data , it 's time to finetune a little our range vs dps correlation . 
   i am going to share two pictures , one with the situation as it is ( just for protoype for simplification ) and one after delta tweaks . 
   the handling of weapons , kick and dispersion , in and out of zoom , is being discussed in [ this thread ] ( https://forums.dust514.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=174412&find=unread ) and i think we have closure on most of those tweaks . 
   ** charlie - dps vs effective range **, 
   ** delta - dps vs effective range **, 
   the delta tweaks are as follows, 
   * 14 % dmg increase of gallente breach assault rifles, 
   * 2 % dmg increase of gallente burst assault rifles, 
   * 4 % dmg increase of assault combat rifles ( but also increasing dispersion to counter long range accuracy ), 
   by setting the tac ar and scrambler rifle at 600 rof , those two line up rather nicely, 
   comments welcome , these should not be contentious changes at all given the relative up of gallente rifles . 
  i have a house . 
  i think some of the beams in the roof are a bit dodgy . 
  i asked some roof inspection guys and they said they do n't do internal stuff , just the external bits of the roof . 
  anyone have any suggestions for good house inspection services ? 
  or bad ones to avoid ... 
  preferably on the south side . 
  i mean , seriously , it 's bad enough that it wo n't accept non-ascii characters so you 'd be shit out of luck if the name of your childhood pet was zo\u00eb or something , but not allowing spaces or plus signs or whatever is ridiculous . 
  are there any web sites that show you what the market screen would look like from a particular station ? 
  you could browse all the orders in the region , rather than being item-based ? 
  i get that eve-central will show you what 's in a particular system , but i 'm talking about showing some other market orders as green because your system is in range even though it 's elsewhere in the region etc. 
  mine 's 7 . 
  was expecting it to be higher , actually . 
  it does n't seem to work . 
  has it ever worked ? 
  [ source : eveo forums ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=5262356#post5262356 ), 
  would like to take a look at them , but i 'm not sure where they can be downloaded from . 
  ( pretend for a moment that they track exactly the same index ) . 
  what are the differences between them in terms of how distributions and capital gains should be handled ? 
  * what is it, 
  * why did nab do it, 
  * how to tell whether i should buy in or stay away, 
  * eve client download fails after a few gb *, 
  turn off osx gatekeeper and try again . 
  * client randomly hangs after a few minutes playing *, 
  turn off eve voice integration in the client settings . 
  * client causes huge heat build up on macbook when alt tabbed out *, 
  eve client is being dumb . 
  minimise it instead and it will drop itself to zero frames per second and your laptop will recover . 
  * client causes huge heat buildup on macbook when in use *, 
  not much you can do about it unless you run wine or boot camp . 
  genolution ca-3 and ca-4 prices have crashed ( from 3.4 b and 2.8 b to less than 100m ) so you can extract a * lot * of bounty from your pod by plugging them in and using an alt to pod yourself ( in game ) . 
  then if you want , you can use some of that bounty reward to buy another set and repeat .

  are there any mortgage brokers who do them , or do i have to shop around a few dozen banks/societies etc ? 
  not looking for a loc for more property ; just to swap out of my margin loan . 
  which heroes do you recommend for holding aura items , or are picked due to having an awesome ( non-global ) aura ? 
  it would be useful to know what percentages people get at different tiers , so i know how discouraged to be . 
  so , lc 's aghs upgrade is an incredibly double-edged sword . 
  duels not expiring means that if the situation nearby changes , you 're at risk of giving the enemy a big swing in power ; you spent an ult , and * they * gained the bonus . 
  so in the end , it does n't help you win bad matchups or let you win marginal matchups , but is really only safe to use picking up solo kills against tanks on full health ( where you need extra duel time because do n't have enough support to burst them down within 5 seconds ), 
  what 's the design goals of aghs anyway ? 
  from what i can tell , in some cases it `` makes your ult better '' like lich , or gives you new abilities like kotl/tiny/treant , but i do n't know any heroes where picking up an aghs is actually a detriment rather than merely a waste of gold . 
  ( re lc , i 'd like to see more perks to aghs to make it more rewarding to balance the risks , like an auto-procced press the attack when the duel initiates , except with it being 5 seconds of spell immunity rather than dispel ), 
  ok , say you 're a person who has $ 100k to invest and for whatever reason , wants to invest it in a single etf ( perhaps they 're american and want to invest in the asx , or they 're aussies that are way overexposed to the domestic market and want in on the mcsi ex-australia index ), 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but these are the fees :, 
  * asx300 : 0.10 % spread , 0.75 % / 0.50 % / 0.35 % fees per annum ( for amounts < 50k / < 100k/100k + ) = $ 625 for 100k, 
  * mcsi ex au : 0.10 % spread , 0.90 % / 0.60 % / .35 % fees ( < 50k / < 100k/100k + ),
