  so it will cost up to $ 100 to buy in , and fees will be $ 625 or $ 750 for the first year . 
  minimum deposit : $ 100 ( bpay ), 
  # etf, 
  * asx300 : brokerage + 0.15 % fees per annum, 
  * mcsi ex au : brokerage + 0.18 % fees, 
  so fees will be much lower ( $ 150 or $ 180 ) but brokerage will be minimum 0.11 % so $ 110 to buy in the first time , and up to 0.30 % if you 're putting in $ 5k at a time for $ 15 . 
  * asx300 : 0.10 % spread , 0.18 % fees, 
  * mcsi ex au : 0.10 % spread , 0.18 % fees, 
  minimum deposit : $ 5000 ( method : unknown ), 
  so , a tiny bit higher than domestic for asx300 but the same for international shares , but a flat 0.10 % input cost instead of variable . 
  that sounds ... pretty good actually . 
  thoughts ? 
  say i have a worker process on a once-per-ten-minutes schedule , that takes 5 minutes to run . 
  will it ever hit the 16 hours-per-day limit of the free tier ? 
  some guy invited me to his ` clan ' , which is maybe a team or a guild ? 
  what is it , and what are the consequences if i say yes ? 
  there are three items that give +10 to one stat . 
  * 2x staff of wizardry builds into rod of atos , which gives lots of + hp , + int and a cripple effect - all of which are great for the generic int hero . 
  * 2x blade of aclarity builds into diffusal blade , which gives absurd + agi as well as a purge and mana break ( which works well for illusion heroes and those with high as but low damage ), 
  what kind of abilities should a hypothetical 2xogre club item have ? 
  note that it does n't necessarily have to be a weapon ... 
  we all read [ the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/3ov6p8/dev_blog_exploring_the_character_bazaar_skill/ ) . 
  this thread is not about discussing it . 
  it 's about how to use skill trading to jumpstart a newbro from ` oh god i want to [ kil2 myself ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9v1f1o3hsb4/utuufr1btbi/aaaaaaaaahu/rnuzit_zw0e/s1600/oblivion+_+we're+not+an+effective+team.png ) ' to ' i am an effective ~ ~ team ~ ~ fleet member ! ', 
  ** scenario : **, 
  * your newbie just subbed and you gave him 800m isk as his buddy rewards . 
  newbie wants to buy a set of +5 implants and a gila . 
  you [ dissuade him ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/3rgxbf2rexluupqpeg/giphy.gif ) . 
  * ** what do you suggest he buys instead ? 
  obviously , one possible answer could be `` some sp to not be so fucking terrible at everything and actually have fun '' . 
  but we all know how bad newbies are at making good decisions , so some canned responses would be a really good idea . 
  an example could be :, 
   ** how good are hobgoblin iis , seriously ** ( 1 skill transfer pack ), 
   * scout drone operation v ( 256k ), 
   * drones v ( 256k ), 
   * gallente drone specialization i ( approx zero ), 
   getting these skills to v is a big grind for a newbie who just wants to [ launch drones ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/181ouqhocfde0/giphy.gif ) ffs why does this game have to be so frustrating, 
  perhaps * people who undock * can think of other 1 - or 2-pack collections of skills that would be useful . 
  * who are the most popular , and do they actually differ in substantial ways ? 
  opinions ? 
  * what 's their revenue model ? 
  * what 's the revenue model for employees ? 
  ( commission , salary etc ), 
  * are they worth it ? 
  ( or rather , what types of people is it worth it for ), 
  # * brewing *, 
  this is a cta ( call to ales ) for the brisbane meetup - with devs !, 
  ** [ details here ] ( http://www.evemeet.net/index.php/upcoming-meets?option=com_ohanah&view=events&itemid=108&ohanah_category_id=&geolocated_country=australia&geolocated_state=&geolocated_city= ) **, 
  if you live in brisbane , then there is literally nothing more exciting to do than to catch up with other spaceship nerds and talk about how awesome downtime is . 
  search your heart ; you know it to be true . 
  so get off the couch and meet pubbies at the pub . 
  the event starts at o7pm . 
  so , i think everyone knows that there 's a reciprocal tax arrangement between the us and australian tax offices , so you 're not double-taxed for us investments . 
  vts would be handled by this arrangement ; would veu as well ? 
  and if i bought shares/funds from other countries , just how badly would i be burnt by double-taxation ? 
  so , a lot of places ( like nabtrade etc ) have a fee based on the ** value ** of the shares you trade ( typically of the order of $ 15 + 0.11 % of the price above $ x ,000 ) . 
  i found a site ( optionsxpress ) that appears to have a fee of $ 14.95 ( for < 1000 shares ) or $ 0.015 / ** share ** for larger amounts . 
  is this common ? 
  it seems to be better if you trade large numbers of shares worth $ 14 or more , but is still great if you 're buying 100 shares of a $ 60 etf . 
  6.86 introduced the ability to plant an ironwood branch and turn it into a tree . 
  if you have an extra branch ( like , you do n't want to turn it into a wand or whatever ) , then your options are, 
  * sell it ( recoup 25g , requires shop or courier time ), 
  * drop it ( lose all the gold you spent ), 
  * plant it and use a tango ( doubles the length of the tango ), 
  4 tangos = 125g , so a double-length tango is worth an extra 37.5 g of healing . 
  37.5  25 , so if you need the healing in lane but do n't need the branch ( or it 's a huge emergency ) , eat it !, 
  ( note : it 's not cost-effective to plant and eat branches that you plan to build into a wand/headdress/buckler , so in that case , better to courier out some more tangos , ideally with the recipe or circlet ), 
  thirteen of the [ last ] ( https://yasp.co/players/39860691/matches ) twenty games i have played are missing the skill bracket . 
  what 's happening ? 
  are there any plans for this ? 
  i would pay money for a shark mouth on my ship , 
   we have a permanent opportunity for a graduate/junior java developer to work across a wide range of technologies to deliver both improvements to existing systems and engineering new products as we grow our business and client base . 
  the successful candidate will need to be an australian citizen and have at least one years ' experience in a similar role and be skilled in developing web based applications with an emphasis on performance and efficiency in a fast paced agile environment . 
  please contact helen jones on 1300\u00a0112\u00a0100 or by email to hjones at 4impact dot com dot au, 
  what options ( if any ) are available ? 
  if you equip a cosmetic that has custom animations , like the lc banner , can you make an effigy that shows that ? 
  ** this week i learned ** : after buying back , 25 % of your hero 's remaining respawn time is added to your next death . 
  that 's another reason not to dieback !, 
  ** last threads most useful tip - / u/nekowaiidesu - 14 points **, 
   this week i learned that if you highlight ta 's trap and use q you can detonate it without using ta 's ability to avoid the animation, 
  [ link to the last thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/4t0b2r/this_week_i_learned/ ), 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://gfycat.com/rigidmadeupfairybluebird ) and it got me thinking . 
  i 'm probably not alone throwing out a ` gg ` or ` ggwp ` at the end of a game . 
  most players already understand what that means , but it would be nice of the dota client automatically detected it and translated it to chat, 
   good game , well played, 
  or whatever , even if only for players that do n't have languages other than english set in their game options . 
  i know the client already kinda does this , since if i type ` ty ` in teamchat , it triggers the `` thanks '' voice chat , but it would help being able to type ` sorry ` , ` wait ` , ` bait ` or whatever , and know that my teammates will understand , no matter which country they 're from . 
  is there a good web site that compares australian share brokers , taking into account, 
  * cost, 
  * chess or otherwise, 
  * easy end-of-year tax reports ( which i did n't know was a thing until now ), 
  * also , i 'm surprised there 's nothing on the sidebar about this , since it crops up from time to time . 
  so , baumi has a claim to fame as the guy who posts custom games , which most other you tubers do n't do . 
  i think it would be good to give a bit of love to the custom games that valve releases , like overthrow and coliseum . 
  not often , just a few times a year , or after a new patch or whatever . 
  as a noob , it seems that pl is an illusion hero with the worst actual illusions ever . 
  given that most of his illusions will be plinking away for `` 12 damage + diffusal '' , and the change to let illusions benefit from attack speed boosts , does it make sense to build more attack speed than the standard stats-heavy build ? 
  also , is there a benefit to picking up a casual orb of venom during the early game , to get better value out of q harass and level 1 ult illusions ?
