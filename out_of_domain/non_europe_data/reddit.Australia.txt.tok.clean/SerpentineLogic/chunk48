  and why would you not ? 
  and then when you have kids , you realise you now need a cloaking device on every ship for when a wild afk appears . 
  why not introduce her to crack cocaine while you 're at it .

  not true . 
  the emu project had a functional build based on leaked since code . 
  i do n't think it has been worked on for years though . 
  ha , he was a level 4 r&d agent in sinq laison . 
  * [ avaghe xarasier ] ( http://eve-agents.com/index.dxd?agentname=avagher%20xarasier ) . 
  is that a real phrase ? 
  i thought it was just a euphemism for having a wank . 
  that makes sense . 
  proximity fuses , radar and nuclear weaponry were three of the most important military advances during ww2 . 
  it 's kinda ordinary tbh . 
  however , their mountain dew is caffeinated , so all is forgiven . 
  fairly certain you get a coercer for free at the end of the advanced military career agent arc . 
  but to answer your question :, 
  400 coercers = the cost of one plex . 
  tbh i would n't even fit the damage control . 
  add a signal distortion amp instead . 
  in australia , it is sold as regular mountain dew as they do not sell the original mountain dew . 
  reprocess it and use the minerals to build something else ( like a vexor ) . 
  no joke . 
  it 's a self-selection bias . 
  the yanks you see here are already a cut above the rest , since they have the, 
  * desire, 
  * money, 
  * lack of criminal history for a visa, 
  depends on your refining skills . 
  you can always check it by reprocessing it - it shows a breakdown of what you ` llget vs what is wasted before you click confirm . 
  shoulda used more probes ( in a 3d cross shape ), 
  so , you get them to contract the ore to you , so you can refine it when it 's convenient to you . 
  maybe something [ like this ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0akkjyf7jg54ldddszc1hawzdn0dtseduewxlwe9lc2c#gid=2 ) . 
  nice try , person with a rake .

  i went through about four trials before i decided to subscribe . 
  why not ? 
  they were free . 
  you can use the steam code with a 21 say trial as well . 
  the other person does n't get the plex though . 
  pro tip : keep your combat and mining skills on separate characters . 
  ancient rogue drones that are better at shooting you than most players . 
  drones are ok for low-end wormhole sites . 
  in mid-class wormholes the drones will get targeted by sleepers and pop . 
  in high-class wormholes , everyone likes the guy in the moros . 
  just remember that a proteus is * still * not as good as the caldari t3 for pve . 
  it is , however , exceptionally good for sneaking up on people while cloaked then destroying them from 5km away . 
  i think you 'll find that the 4th shield extender should be an adaptive invulnerability field . 
  also , taking off a shield power relay and replacing it with a drone damage amplifier will make a big difference . 
  make new thread about proteus then . 
  upboat for guzman y gomez, 
  you know , if there 's two of you , he could just orbit you and you could shield transfer each other . 
  no need to use all your mid slots and low slots on it either . 
  i recommend you keep your mining skills and combat skills on separate characters . 
  i 'm ok with making high-sec ganking costly , as long as ccp makes high-sec *** living *** costly . 
  so brave, 
  because it encountered stiff opposition . 
  eve is like prison . 
  you really have to gank someone the first day , or you 'll end up as someone else 's ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ renter . 
  because his conscience was pricked . 
  or at the very least , have concord charge them for turning up and ` protecting ' them . 
  to be fair , blasters + null , or auto cannon + barrage ammunition are also similarly awesome for their respective weapon types . 
  pretty soon you 'll have alliances with two dots at the end , for extra edginess, 
  [ owait ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/babylon_5 . . ), 
  looks like one of your friends should punch the other in the face . 
  anyway , his ban is probably temporary . 
  he 'll lose all the isk he got sent ( likely double the amount , actuall ) , but he should be able to continue playing after the ban . 
  read isktheguide.com now . 
  eve-metrics shut down a while ago . 
  i believe the code base was picked up by eve-marketdata . com though . 
  [ some guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) . 
  check your assets window - maybe it 's stashed somewhere else . 
  well , eve has [ its own version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kggw0ulpa&amp;feature=related ) . 
  7 years would polish off the industry skills though . 
  mow friends ' parents lawns . 
  get them to buy you game time codes online . 
  play eve . 
  i have alts that were specifically crafted to look like cate blanchett and jamie lee curtis . 
  apparently this is a [ common thing ] ( http://kotaku.com/5744897/celebrity-impersonators-invade-the-virtual-spaceways ) to do . 
  and this is worse than other mmos how ? 
  in eve , every item you can fit to a ship has a meta level , from 0 to 15 . 
  in most cases , only meta 0 and meta 5 items are able to be mass-produced , so they 're generally cheaper than other meta levels . 
  from what i understand , you can pay money in dust to buy meta-level weapons and ammo that take less skill levels to equip . 
  once your skill levels are high enough for meta 5 , then you can get equivalent weapons much cheaper . 
  jealous of what ? 
  til pvping in a frigate requires perfect skills or the world will end . 
  guess he should have done more tutorials . 
  because hulk wrecks drop loot ? 
  i think there 's a massive mining corporation in solitude . 
  anyone remember what they 're called ?
