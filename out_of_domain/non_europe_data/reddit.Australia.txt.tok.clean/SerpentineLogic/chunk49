  read halada 's mining guide yet ? 
  i loved them in [ last friday night ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klyxnrrsk4a#t=6m35s ) . 
  in soviet russia ... 
  sarmatiko is n't known for made-up scoops . 
  i suggest you check your assumptions . 
  i 'd rather mow lawns . 
  obligatory [ join fweddit ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/fweddit ) post . 
  join fweddit ? 
  [ and my bow ] ( http://chzsomuchpun.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-puns-you-have-my-sword.png ), 
  how to make a small fortune selling boosters :, 
  start with a large fortune . 
  you probably will get the stuff you paid for . 
  and then ccp will take it away again when they find out . 
  not worth it compared to selling a plex on market . 
  yes , but it is probably hard to shut them down . 
  depends on your roles and their roles . 
  there 's a free trial . 
  there 's even a [ thread about getting free trials ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/nieri/142160_day_trial_thread/?sort=new ) . 
  aside from eve-voice and the browser , eve can happily run on a 56k modem . 
  with three remaps i suggest int/per for a while because you need support skills but being punished by the piloting and gunnery training is no fun for a new bro . 
  after a few months , say 6 months , go per/will and do those hard trains on t2 ships and guns . 
  about a year or so later , you 'll probably switch to full int/mem to finish all those support skills you left at iv . 
  as a rule of thumb , do n't feel bad about training any skill to iv , because even if it 's a waste of time , you have n't spent much time on it . 
  that 's why the pros trade with other people 's money . 
  i 'd be happy just being able to put them in sell and courier contracts . 
  tactical weapon reconfig v would be nice , because tech 2 siege modules are pretty nice . 
  also jump drive calibration v. 
  i do n't suppose you already have a moros ? 
  they 're * somewhat * more expensive now . 
  the moros [ does n't use ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=19724 ) drones any more . 
  is this a fire sale or something ? 
  a few questions :, 
  do you really like mining , or is it just something that you know how to do , so you 're doing it ? 
  if you like to mine , i can suggest a few mining corporations . 
  if you do n't like mining , then there 's a lot more interesting things we can suggest . 
  do you really like running missions and killing npcs , or are you just doing it for the isk ? 
  if you like to kill red plus signs , we can suggest a few things to aim towards . 
  if you 'd prefer to try pvp , there are many corporations that offer free ( cheap ) ships , so the lack of income wo n't be a burden . 
  the army can reject you at their discretion , or recruit you anyway and send you to clean the toilets of the recruitment centers . 
  that 's entirely beside the point . 
  the point is that if you vote for war , ** you ** ca n't say no when the army says `` we want you to fight . '', 
  the rate of fire buff was worth it . 
  a [ gank moros ] ( http://www.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=12548587 ) can put out 13000 dps now . 
  you can put together a viable pvp fit with ten hours total training . 
  depending what you catch , you may need friends to help kill our target . 
  luckily , eve is an mmo so friends are kinda built into the game . 
  i 'd be tempted to create a new pvp focused character and join fweddit . 
  keep your minimum character around , since high sec space becomes unsafe once you join faction warfare . 
  you go into a polling station , get your name checked off the electoral roll , and receive a voting slip . 
  a secret ballot is when you fill out the voting with nobody looking on , so nobody knows exactly how you voted , only that you did . 
  it stops stuff like `` all employees shall vote for < x  or face dismissal '' or `` vote for < y  or your wife and kids get it '', 
  that does not compute . 
  if the security of the nation is in jeopardy , the fate of your sons and daughters is self-evidently at risk . 
  this is averted by sending isk every time you pick up their jetcan . 
  it would probably require a loot-log analyser in order to not / wrists . 
  i was referring to making another character on the same account . 
  only one character per account can be training a skill at once . 
  if you want to train skills on both characters at once , you 'll need another account , along with all the subscription fees that entails . 
  most eve players end up subscribing with two accounts , even if one of them is only periodically active ( a few times a year , ccp offers a power of two promotion , which is 6 months playing time for $ 50 on newly-created accounts ), 
  make an alt character ? 
  they already know who you are , because you 're on the electoral roll ( i.e. 
  the list of people who are allowed to vote ) . 
  they ( theoretically ) have enough information about you to prevent someone impersonating you . 
  however , that 's somewhat tangential to the voting itself . 
  working as intended . 
  by the end of the 50-mission chain , it helps if you can fly a cruiser , or at least a destroyer . 
  the pirate in the final mission is fairly tough for a new player . 
  that reads like someone ** totally without ** an axe to grind . 
  they are the band of brothers hiding in the center of the militia . 
  you 're already * in * nullsec . 
  just get in a bomber and kill some bads running sanctums . 
  preferably someone hostile , but by all means shoot blues ( for practice ) . 
  i tackle in assault frigates . 
  feels good man . 
  yeah . 
  probably from their loyalty store . 
  give them a ship and they give you a reskinned one back . 
   hey ,, 
   we currently are looking at npcs in the fw complexes . 
  the plan is to remove all npcs doing ew in all factions to equalize difficulty a bit . 
  we wo n't touch the missile spam for now however as most of the npcs are used in missions as well , but this should help a bit until we get into a proper iteration of this for this winter . 
  this also wo n't apply for fw missions , only fw complexes for now . 
   we also are looking into an issue that prevents fw complexes from despawning properly , which in turn prevents new sites from spawning until the next downtime . 
  estimated time for such changes is to have them out as soon as possible ( sorry , ca n't give estimate though , still working on them as we speak ) . 
   hope that helps a bit . 
  it 's not the soloing , it 's when fighting happens while you 're in there . 
  having some rats damp you out is one thing . 
  having them jam the hell out of you is quite another . 
  covert ops v , on the other hand . 
  +15 % torp damage , free up about 50 cpu from your cloak . 
  i think it 's because ecm modules have a 20 second cycle but ecm drones have a 4 second cycle . 
  normal drones are 4 seconds . 
  probably deserves testing . 
  it 's good that we have a ( mostly ) non-terrible inventory now ( loving that shift-click on cargobay icon in space brings it up in a separate window ) , but i did n't really expect them to continue that rapid pace forever . 
  it 's a pretty good buff to your faction standings , depending on which faction you ally with in the last mission . 
  confirming that it is incredibly handy to have a minimal-skilled character on your account stashed away at a trade hub , even if you do n't want to be a full-time trader . 
  by * minimal * skills , i mean :, 
  * trade iii, 
  * contracting i, 
  * broker relations iii,
