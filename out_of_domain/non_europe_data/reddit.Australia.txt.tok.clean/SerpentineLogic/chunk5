  * tax % is taken off the material 's taxable value . 
  * this value is set by ccp and is based off the market values in november 2011, 
  * import is always half of export tax, 
  * the taxable value are the same for all items in the same tier, 
  * advanced commodities : 1,350,000.00 isk, 
  * specialized commodities : 70,000.00 isk, 
  * refined commodities : 9,000.00 isk, 
  * basic commodities : 500.00 isk, 
  * planet resources : 5.00 isk, 
  so you 're now paying , what , 10 % of those taxable values ? 
  i make 5 million isk per planet per day in highsec , when i can be bothered . 
  if you ca n't , that 's your problem . 
  utility is pedestrian . 
  art is priceless . 
  nice try , two step . 
  25 million isk per day means i 'm 100m up every time i login without the grind of missions . 
  not bad for , what , 260k skill points invested . 
  tracking ? 
  what 's that ? 
  i , too , want you to have his babies . 
  [ two step was duped ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?4631-december-csm-summit-topics&amp;p=302945&amp;viewfull=1#post302945 ), 
   give and take, 
  i do n't think altruism is high on the list of those with sociopathic tendencies . 
  it 's either take , or give with an expectation of taking later . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  people make millions of dollars each year by acting . 
  now , consider how good you 'd be if your life , literally , depended upon acting normal . 
  purger and extender rigs are also ten times the cost . 
  for a noob in a 4m isk cruiser , an extra 5m in rigs is a bfd . 
  i just noticed this : you have 3 guns and 2 missiles , which is n't * terrible * . 
  however ,, 
  * your ship gives bonuses to guns , so you should fit more of them, 
  * you have more guns than missiles , so use magnetic field stabilizers , not ballistic control systems . 
  i 'm sure this happens all the time in level 2 missions , and will not be a waste of isk on a boat that will only be useful until the op can buy a battlecruiser ~, 
   anyone got a good pi primer ?

  yes , same with any game you shoot . 
  i have never been * tempted * to eat any part of the feral pigs i have shot - they 're riddled with nasties . 
  so , basically just like real investment bankers , but with spaceship instead of luxury yacht . 
  til that the word ` gerrymander ' was coined [ in boston ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering#etymology ) . 
  it 's not only legal , it 's [ laudable ] ( http://eve-history.net/wiki/index.php/guiding_hand_social_club ) . 
  eve is a game that allows every player to run their own organised crime ring , do insider trading , corporate espionage or market manipulation to their heart 's content ( or until someone bigger stops you ), 
  in fact , it 's not just allowed , it 's * [ encouraged ] ( http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/14/view/forums/thread/329648/goonswarm-shrugged.html ) * .

  for those behind firewalls :, 
   hey in there , you are not forgotten , just a bit busy with multiple stuff coming in . 
   here are the iteration changes planned for tech2 mods :, 
   * ** triage module ii ** : now provides a 20 % capacitor reduction to remote capital armor repairers , remote capital hull repairers , capital shield transfers and capital energy transfers while in triage mode . 
  does n't provide any bonus to local repairer/boosters however . 
  previously the module had little interest to train for , should now be worth the time . 
   * ** sister core probe launcher ** and ** expanded probe launcher ** : now provide a 10 % boost to scan probe strength instead of 5 % . 
  that 's to keep an appeal for the faction mods despite the arrival of a tech2 version . 
   * ** skirmish warfare link - interdiction maneuvers ii ** and ** ~ ~ skirmish ~ ~ information warfare link - sensor integrity ii ** : boost increased from 3.5 to 3.75 % to keep the tech2 boost consistent among all warfare modules . 
   * ** information warfare link - electronic superiority ii ** : boost for remote sensor dampeners and tracking disruptors increased from 1.25 to 1.5 % . 
  previous numbers were erroneous . 
   * ** mining foreman link - mining laser field enhancement ii ** : boost increased from 5 to 5.625 % : same reason as above , to keep tech2 boost consistent among all gang links . 
   * ** federation navy omnidirectional tracking link ** : tracking and speed multipliers for drones increased from 1.25 x to 1.3 x , again to keep an interest on the faction variant next to the new tech2 module . 
   * ** bomb launcher ii ** : capacity increased from 150 to 225m3 , allows it to carry 3 bombs instead of 2 . 
   feedback is welcome . 
  like king_hobo . 
  you know , something with gravitas ... 
  you have good luck . 
  assuming you 're making a hulk ( you 'd have more profit by using a test reports decryptor btw ) then realistically your chances are in the 28-29 % camp . 
  hope to see you in game , especially if you learn to use paragraphs / o \\ \\, 
  i 'll see your +5 s and raise you some [ drake implants ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=11847282 ) . 
  if you are space-poor , get the ca-1 implant , sell it via contracts for ~ 100 million isk . 
  you can use the isk to buy most of the other packages and still have tends of millions remaining . 
  if you plan to be playing for at least a year , get the remap . 
  most combat players bounce between needing int-primary support skills and per-primary ship/gun skills . 
  having an extra remap up your sleeve is guaranteed to save you months of training . 
  ( remember , each month = one plex = 400 million isk you saved ), 
  srsly , if you 're raging about the cost of buying an attribute implant , just sell the ca-2 on contracts for 75m isk , because you obviously need the isk more than you need the ca-2 . 
  i highly recommend spending a plex for isk within the first couple of months playing . 
  a lot of the problems new players have is that , past the first month , their income does not scale up at the same time as their expenses , so they become extremely risk-averse and miserly , which stunts their enjoyment . 
  face facts : you * will * lose your first battlecruiser to some noob mistake . 
  if you know you have enough isk to replace it six-fold , the loss is regrettable . 
  if you do n't , though , it can be heartbreaking . 
  rule # 2 of eve : do n't trust anybody you ca n't punch in the face irl .

  eve is real ~, 
  confirming that the most profitable ships to salvage in low sec are those that recently belonged to other players . 
   you could be pulling , in theory , 1.3 mil per day per planet which would be ~ ~ ~ 19.5 mil a day x 30 days would be 585 mil per month . ~ ~ ~, 
  i think you mean 6.5 m/day , or 195m/month . 
  * 5 planets -  6 planets = 20 % more pi, 
  * advanced cc -  elite cc = less than 20 % more pi ( but useful for manufacturing planets that ca n't otherwise fit a fourth spaceport ),
