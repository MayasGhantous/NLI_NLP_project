  just enough to handle buying and selling stuff then making contracts to courier stuff to and from wherever your main character is . 
  of course , a true trading character remaps for trade and social skills , goes after accounting , margin trading and wholesale while building up high standings , but that 's another story . 
  it 's certainly possible via trade . 
  gevlon [ started playing ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/found-my-why-in-eve.html ) on february 14th , and is [ already up ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/may-business-report.html ) to 38 billion isk . 
  that 's already enough isk to pay his subscription for ** six years ** . 
  you 're a new player so i suggest doing support skills rather than combat skills ( because combat skills will take more than 6 months to beef up , and are less boring ), 
  that means :, 
  * remap to int/mem, 
  * cybernetics iv , plug in +4 implants for int and mem ( or whatever you can afford ), 
  * engineering v, 
  * mechanic v, 
  * electronics v, 
  * energy management v, 
  * energy systems operation v, 
  * electronics upgrades v ( now you have prereqs for covops ), 
  * signature analysis v ( now you have prereqs for recon ships ), 
  * long range targeting v ( now you have prereqs for logistics ), 
  * evasive maneuvring v ( now you have prereqs for interceptors ), 
  * propulsion jamming v ( now you have prereqs for interdictors , but will need science v for the probe launcher ), 
  * energy emission systems iv ( for neuts . 
  v is nice too ), 
  * energy grid upgrades iv ( capacitor modules ), 
  * jury rigging iii - there 's other rigging skills worth training to iv as well, 
  * salvaging iv +, 
  * afterburner iv ( not v ), 
  * acceleration control iv + ( v is very nice ), 
  * high speed maneuvering iv, 
  and then whatever other skills are required for the [ tech 2 tank ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/full_t2_tank ) of your choice . 
  obviously , picking up some electronic warfare or remote repair skills is also an option , but this should keep you going for six months . 
  read gevlon 's blog and find out . 
  fulldisclosu.re is also good . 
  then stop looking at / r/gonewild ? 
  install evemon , and put your desired training plan in there , along with an api key for your character . 
  i believe it has a timer or something so your so can tell whether they need to login to set up the next skill . 
  it might be an idea to do your neural remap , install implants and buy all the relevant skillbooks before you hand over the account details . 
  also , at least show them how to undock and dock , and how to use the inventory in case they ` touch something ' then get stuck . 
  i 'd find out which hospital sydney has a spinal unit , then ask there - they will have support staff who would be able to answer your questions . 
  * [ / r/fweddit faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fweddit/comments/u5p39/faq/ ), 
  deep space transports are actually better in lowsec or highsec than null . 
  he started with one . 
  now he can afford as many as he likes . 
  for an individual , no . 
  for a corp , possibly . 
  see : noir mercenary group, 
  join red vs blue, 
  a few hundred million isk at the start of your eve journey can make a big difference . 
  just being able to plug in a set of cheap +3 implants can make your training go 30 % faster , and you do n't have to worry so much about affording the next skill book . 
  it 's not an unlimited source of new ships , but it should get you your first cruiser and battlecruiser . 
  fweddit offers free ships , so it 's not as if you 'll go broke . 
  the alternative at your skill point level would be running level 1 or 2 missions , which are n't particularly rewarding either . 
  i once [ wrote a thing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/jump-freighter-manual/ ) about jump freighters . 
  realistically ? 
  optimistically ? 
  still no . 
  you could grind your way towards enough isk to pay for your subscription , but it requires a fair bit of luck and intimate knowledge of how the game works to pull it off . 
  frankly , it 's faster and easier to just wash someone 's car or mow their lawn irl and get money for another month 's playing time , at least for the first few months . 
  so , i hear you 'd like a [ faction standings repair plan ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/faction_standing_repair_plan ) . 
  ** tldr ; **, 
  * train diplomacy and social, 
  * go to the amarr rookie systems and blitz their career agent arcs, 
  * spend some cash on the amarr data centers, 
  * do everything again , except for the caldari faction, 
   why would ecm stack anyways ? 
  game balance , perhaps ? 
  oh , you like guides ? 
  [ here 's a few ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) . 
  then i suggest you stay on the trial and make a new one when your time runs out . 
  i went through four trials before subscribing , so it 's nothing unusual . 
  indeed . 
  i suggest you create each trial as a separate race , so you can compare how the different ship types handle . 
  after the two months , perhaps you 'll have saved up the money for a subscription . 
  fairly certain you can sign up multiple times with the same email address . 
  just the account name will need to be different . 
  if you want to reuse the same character name , you 'll have to delete the character before the trial expires though . 
  there are three rookie systems for each faction , so you can just fly to another rookie system to try the industry career arc again . 
  i suggest you read http://fulldisclosu.re and http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com then . 
  when i say ` stack ' i meant ` have stacking penalties ' . 
  sorry for any confusion . 
  this would be clearer if you removed the lines that are the same . 
  all agents are quality 20 for rewards now . 
  the only determining factor in rewards is now your security connections and the sec status of the agent 's location . 
  if you can salvage and loot wrecks after someone else has completed a level 4 mission , you should be able to get 5-10 million per hour . 
  that 's fifty hours for one plex , or as we in the real world like to say , `` 35c/hour '', 
  ironically , pve in eve would be a lot better if it were devilishly hard ; something that carebears do n't realise .

  on the plus side , you 'll look like you 're twenty years old , right up until you die of cancer . 
  til my mother in law is a bioethicist . 
  i suggest great wildlands . 
  speak softly , and nurse your kill rights like the grudges they truly are . 
  come for the spaceships , stay for the emo thread . 
  or the $ 25 tengu , or the $ 2300 ragnarok ... 
  their recruitment standard are pretty high , actually . 
  * must like being shot at, 
  * must not be obvious about being a spy, 
  * there is no third requirement, 
  i have run all serpentis and most guristas plexes ( except the maze ) in a standard [ 5-launcher brick ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#tank ) tengu . 
  come to think of it , all the serpentis plexes can be run with a [ 6-launcher fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#tank ) as well , although it can get a bit hairy solo . 
  as far as ishtar tank fits , something like this will tank practically everything serpentis . 
  just fill in the high slots .
