  according to [ skilltrainingcomplete ] ( http://skilltrainingcomplete.com/questions/do-i-get-anything-loot-salvage-isk-for-killing-a-pos ) , hangar arrays , labs and ship maintenance arrays drop half their loot . 
  not sure about silos - it 's possible that anyone can access them after the tower pops . 
  the effects of agent orange are well-known in australia , after being immortalized in the song ' [ i was only nineteen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtiyp-g6jy ) ' . 
  they 're < 5m to buy , so they 're worth rolling the dice on . 
  buying a capital ship pilot ? 
  [ there 's an app for that ] ( http://www.toshimo.com/capital_pilots.html ) . 
  well , as he says , ` eveiseasy ' . 
  also , player ships have better salvage than npc ships , 
  i joined estel arador when i were a noob , then installed jump clones everywhere , 
  so , how well-hung are witches anyway ? 
  his 2004 tony award for best leading actor in a [ musical ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_boy_from_oz ) disputes your claim . 
  the correct phrase is, 
  `` that 's not a pine cone . 
  * this * is a pine cone . '', 
  tma bugging the 8/10 because i only know how to bug out the 10/10 . 
  no less effort than running a mission , although it does n't require combat skills to do , and so is ideal for characters with weak combat skills . 
  same stats , less cpu . 
  your mistake is thinking eve is a game where you are the hero of the story . 
  many solo players i know do exploration . 
  it 's a solitary pursuit but quite rewarding . 
  proteus is great in pvp , just not so much in pve . 
  that 's why people use sentry ishtars instead . 
  what 's new since 2009 ? 
  here 's a [ post i prepared earlier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
   welcome to eve , where most of your info will come in the form in google searches of blogs / articles / wikis / general info . 
  to be fair , most of the info in * life * now comes that way . 
  meh , there 's web sites for that already , 
  not a filter , but you can add the column so you can sort stuff . 
  it 's pretty nice . 
  siege warfare spec would be nice . 
  prices for characters are pretty low atm though . 
  not sure why . 
  btw diablo 3 has a terrible economy , which is why all the eve bloggers that were planning to use their expertise in d3 pulled out after week or so . 
  i , like many people do , work out my fits outside the game . 
  prenatal photoshop . 
  ww2 reparations were taken from assets ( land , patents , people , machinery ) . 
  the slate is now clean . 
  cover up unsightly buttons ? 
  in australia , you are required to get your name signed off the electoral roll , pick up a voting slip , go to a polling booth then put the slip in the ballot box . 
  you are ** not ** required to actually fill out the voting slip . 
   i feel like an idiot . 
  i just realized that t2 guns do not do more damage than their meta 4 counterparts, 
  whoah there . 
  did you forget about the < size  < weapon  specialization skill ? 
  that 's a flat 2-10 % damage bonus for free for using t2 weapons . 
  as far as t2 stuff not being cost-efficient , i use scourge fury missiles in my tengu unless forced to by elite frigates . 
  it costs about 3.5 m isk per hour , but the increased kill speed ( 30 % more deeps ) pays for itself ( and more ) . 
  however , that 's probably a special case . 
  having 8 guns chewing through barrage l is probably not worth it ( although might be for a vargur since it 's only 4 guns ), 
  lp he mines is free . 
  nice remap ; well suited to a player in your situation . 
  you 're flying minmatar , so you should get all those navigation skills to iv ( and personally , i 'd put evasive maneuvering , navigation and acceleration control v on my skill plan before you ever remap ), 
  you 'll also need drones v . at the very least , you should prioritise the skills required to use t2 light and medium drones , since they 're likely to save your ship if you get webbed and scrammed by a rat . 
  on the support skills front , i suggest tyou train the prereqs for covops , recons , interdictors and logistics ships . 
  iirc , that 's a few skills at v , but all of them are useful . 
  also , check the prereqs for the various minmatar subsystem skills - you may want to train up the int-based ones now , before your inevitable remap to per/will . 
  chances are you 'll be running with a shield tank , so prioritise skills required for large shield extender ii and adaptive invuln iis . 
  on the gunnery and spaceship command side , aim for t2 medium autocannon and battlecruiser iv for now , since you 'll be spending most of your time doing support skills . 
  you 're not remapped well for t2 ship skills , but you can do perfectly well in a t1-gunned hurricane for a few months . 
  dude he 's only a couple of weeks from getting into a t2 fit cane . 
  he does n't need to reship to a drake at this point . 
  til, 
  m8 do n't gank the newbies . 
  wait for them to have something worth killing first . 
  faction launchers are even better . 
  just bear in mind that there 's occasional scams , sometimes even [ by the list owner ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/bulk-trade-mailing-list-run-by-a-scammer/ ) . 
  planetary interaction . 
  at the end of the day , you know you 'll still have 17.50 worth of isk at any time . 
  do the amarr career agents instead ? 
  getting in on the ground floor ~, 
  it 's a screenshot of a ccp dev interview . 
  hardly nda 'd, 
  ironically , mining in null is safer than low due to the ability to bubble up gates . 
  depending on how long ' a while ' is , you may have luck with a petition to move your current ship to highsec . 
  no guarantee that the gm will move the rest of your stuff though . 
  think of it as the baseline intelligence test to get in . 
  you 're upset you passed ? 
  i bet every time he unplugs he thinks `` man , this sure beats getting podded . '', 
  frigates are usually solo eggers . 
  go with the one with the best portrait . 
  try some exploration . 
  you probably wo n't find much at this stage , but it 's good practice . 
  when in doubt , train for a core certificate . 
  why not just submit a patch to eve central ?
