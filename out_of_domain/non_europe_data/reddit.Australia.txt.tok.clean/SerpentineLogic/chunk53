   despite a damage and tracking bonus , the stiletto 's damage output is poor and usually an afterthought to its tackling ability - in direct damage terms this ship presents little threat . 
  if a stiletto engages you , the chances are it has a gang on its way to back it up !, 
  jester [ has a suggested fit ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/fit-of-week-fleet-stiletto.html ) , but i prefer the one listed in the comments with a nosferatu . 
  ... and if you want something a bit bigger , fly a shield nano rupture . 
  ( pro tip : adding a nano to a ruppie makes it just like a stabber , except tougher ), 
  come to think of it , kreddit is a great name for a reddit industrial corp. 
   not that it matters , as the minerals resource rent tax will take back plenty . 
  not really . 
  mrrt does n't kick in until you 're making pretty hefty profits ( ~ 13 % or so ) . 
  also , existing mines get various types of exemptions . 
  t2 weps also benefit from wep spec skills , regardless of the ammo they 're using . 
  so , free skillpoint reimbursement ? 
  so switch belts . 
  [ now kiss ] ( http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/png/fap-now-kiss.png ), 
   she probably saved the lives of a few women who would have died in labor, 
  considering all the pregnant jews they could ended up dead by experimentation , i would say that the three thousand abortions she performed each saved a life . 
  if they were ( visibly ) pregnant on arrival , they went straight to the gas chamber . 
  resolute that this shit should never happen again . 
  because she did the abortions out in the camps , without oversight from the nazi doctors ( the regular soldiers would n't have a clue what procedures were ok or not ), 
  twoscoops , one barge ? 
  and corp members would be called kredditors . 
  why do you have a laser rig on that ? 
  i do n't often run low volume inter regional hauling , but when i do , i use an interceptor . 
  obviously that 's not an option for a new industry focused character , but any frigate will work , preferably one with a shield resistance bonus so you can tank it and still fit nanos . 
  i believe the design changes will make it deal more damage but be less resilient . 
  more hurricane , less cyclone . 
  at that range you should be nuking his optimal range , because you 're so far away that you wo n't get enough transverse speed to outrun his tracking . 
  well , duh . 
  because it will be cloaked . 
  yeah . 
  they 're doing it in australia ( which has really low-carbon soil compared to the rest of the world ) . 
  basically , get some biological material ( nut shells , sugarcane offcuts , weeds , whatever ) , turn it into charcoal then plough it into the soil . 
  it 's better than fertilizer , carbon-negative and saves on disposal of the biomatter . 
  there 's a [ corp for that ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/salvaging-service-theres-a-corp-for-that/ ) . 
  try joining them ? 
  why ? 
  if you declare a war mutual , that implies that you think you 're hard enough to take them on . 
  you guys brag about the * weirdest * things . 
  if you * have to * mine in lowsec ( tip : you do n't ) , then at least scan down a gravimetric site and mine in there . 
  that way , barring people who have already scanned down the site ( there will be a few ) , you only need to warp off if you see scan probes on your directional scanner . 
  if you 're belt mining in lowsec , you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  double-income , ( usually ) no kids . 
  til that there is a tech 2 version of brew enhancer . 
  `` what does father jenkins give for telling falsehoods ? '', 
  `` three hail marys and three our fathers and you have to apologise to the person you lied to . '', 
  `` what does he give for underage sex ? '', 
  `` a can of coke and a mars bar . '', 
  that 's because tolerance and acceptance are two different words . 
  the koran is much like the bible . 
  if you can pick and choose which bits to read , you can justify anything . 
  i do n't know what you 're arguing against , but i certainly did n't write it . 
  garnish with rust ? 
  the whole point of an armor tanking fit is so you can fit a codebreaker and analyser into the mid slots . 
  also it 's lowsec and you 're pve fit so you do n't need an mwd . 
  personally , i 'd replace the 1600mm plate with a drone damage mod and call it done . 
  ccp ytterbium would like to see them on destroyer hulls , according to a recent dev post , which seems like a radical departure from what everyone was expecting ( battleship-level ), 
  * a [ list of stuff ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) you missed . 
  occasionally ? 
  i think you mean every 180 seconds like clockwork . 
  do you have a web ( or a scram on a pvp boat ) ? 
  then use the armature . 
  worth paying a premium for , even , since they do n't have to transport them . 
  you 'd be surprised the number of junior-legaue coaches that use this to gauge the athletic potential of newbies . 
  you 've seen her hands ? 
  just bear in mind that maximum capacitor regen is at [ about 25 % ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/capacitor_management_101#what_is_.22cap_stable.22.3f_do_i_want_it.3f ) capacitor . 
  below that , your capacitor regen drops sharply . 
  that seems a bit mean . 
  use code tags , that table is terrible . 
  sort the list from top to bottom, 
  smoking was n't considered harmful , either , around 1900 . 
  why not [ build a laser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mosquito_laser ) instead ? 
  [ like this ? 
  sleepers do n't eat drones in c1 and c2 sites . 
  tengu is good because it aligns fast and does n't have drones , so assigning fighters wo n't cost you any dps . 
  also , your main can already fly one . 
  main : tengu ( or whatever you want ), 
  alt : thanatos with fighters assigned, 
  it 's interesting that the three ages of gamers also determine their resistance or acceptance to microtransactions . 
  * gamers in their twenties are only okay with cosmetic effects , because they do n't want to be crowded out by rich players ** or ** have their in-game achievements diluted by weekend warriors . 
  they are * very * supportive of cosmetic ( status ) effects that require in-game skill to unlock . 
  * gamers in their thirties are a-ok with paying for convenience , and will happily pony up plex for remaps , moving their gear around without courier contracts and for general isk , because they do n't have the time for the : effort : involved in ratting for income . 
  these are the sorts of players who use a plex for multiple hurricane fits for pvping . 
  * gamers in their forties now have the time , but ca n't or wo n't expend the effort to become elite , so they supplement skill by spending money . 
  these are the players who use multiple plex for deadspace-fit tengus for pvp . 
  a shield-tanked vindi or machariel are both fine for doing sanctums . 
  when i stalk people in a stealth bomber , i put on lustmord . 
  on a general roam , i put on the crystal method . 
  when mining , i put on enya .
