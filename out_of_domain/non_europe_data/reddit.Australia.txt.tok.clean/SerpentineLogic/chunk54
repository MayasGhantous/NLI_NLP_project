  obviously when fighting angel cartel , you 'd swap to 800mm autos . 
  i think i have one of those , given as an inheritance . 
  in the early 1980s , $ 200 was a ** lot ** of money . 
  i remember my mum losing $ 50 when she got her purse stolen and breaking into tears . 
  there was a lot of breakfast cereal for dinner that month . 
  what 's the consensus on shoeboxes ? 
  can you code ? 
  the fitter is open source . 
  i 'd run cap boosters , myself . 
  i often recommend a suitcase on newbie battleship fits , because they 're prone to making a mistake and only escaping in structure . 
  we keep saying ` do n't fly what you ca n't afford to lose ' but losing a maelstrom is bad news any time in the first year you 're playing . 
  he was far more enlightened than most people of his time . 
  what more can you expect from a human being ? 
  and apparently came back with souvenirs . 
  in soviet korea , small penises are into * him * . 
  think of it this way :, 
  at least we heard about this retardedness before it hit sisi ( or god forbid , tq ), 
  to the forums !, 
  that 's kinda the problem . 
  i think everyone heard about the tech 1 mining barge changes , and expected the exhumers to have the same style of bonus :, 
  * skiff would be an extra-tanky version of the procurer, 
  * mack would be the extra-large-cargohold version of the retriever, 
  * hulk would be the extra-bonused version of the covetor, 
  instead , ytterbium seems to imply that mack would still be ice-bonused and hulk would still be everything-bonused , which defeats the purpose of the barge change . 
  i mean , yeah , using an ubertanked skiff to mine ice might soon be * possible * , but losing out on the mack 's massive yield bonus on top over everything else just adds insult to injury . 
  `` struktura '', 
  i 'm all for risk vs reward , but having the t1 ships have three roles as tank/afk/yield , but the t2 ships being at cross-purposes ( m/ice/ore ) is counterintuitive . 
  t1 bpcs only have to be max-run . 
  me level does n't matter , because they 'll be fed into the invention process anyway . 
  t2 bpcs do n't sell particularly well , since invention slots are fairly easy to come by compared to copy slots . 
  t1 guns and x-type shield booster ? 
  inquiring minds wish to know where you 'll be flying this . 
  120m isk buys you a lot of cap boosters , just saying .

  you can easily adjust this fit for a lse and lasb instead , if you prefer . 
  some conclusions can be made from your post . 
  either pos fuel is overpriced , or t2 materials are underpriced . 
  a smart person could make money from this knowledge . 
  chances are that any moon that has r64 will alread have a tower on it . 
  there is a lot of sadistic glee to be found by searching for towers with moon miners on them , scanning the planet and posting the results on dotlan to end their obscurity, 
  you * already said * that moon minerals do n't pay for the pos fuel used to extract them . 
  so , if you want to run complex reactions , just buy the input materials from the market instead of wasting isk mining them . 
  pyfa and eft are already able to export any fit as xml , which you can throw into eve \\ fittings and import . 
  ccp [ expects ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadid=1004883 ) us to do this , even . 
  i can understand if ccp was unwilling to parse an external program 's data format inside their client though . 
  as i said , that would mean ccp would be responsible for parsing eft format , which is, 
  * not controlled by them, 
  * potentially a security risk, 
  so i suspect it wo n't be happening soon . 
  where the hell are you ? 
  last time i was in null , transport costs for pos fuel was only 5.2 % of their price . 
  i can see your point about moon minerals though - i suggest you park your reaction chain in a c1 instead . 
  you will need :, 
  small is ok but cramped , medium is nice and will handle a few people . 
  budget for a month of fuel , and various ecm modules . 
  * isk for some bpos . 
  which ones ? 
  you better work that out before you start . 
  * some labs . 
  you 'll probably want one of each type , but add multiple advanced labs once you expand . 
  * optionally : decryptors and datacores for invention . 
  * ( moon mining chews up an entire small pos worth of powergrid , so it 's unlikely to be worth it ), 
  put pos up , start researching or copying, 
  optionally , invent using datacores + bpcs, 
  1 . ship all your t1 and t2 bpcs to highsec because sourcing the components to make them is a massive pain in the ass, 
  use a manufacturing alt to make stuff from your bpcs, 
  1 . sell researched bpos , buy unresearched ones, 
  1 . rinse , repeat,
