  there 's a rumour that the new destroyer boats will be ` alternate weapon ' platforms . 
  that suggests the caldari destroyer will be a rocket-spewing missile destroyer , which has a certain appeal . 
  no , they were small and medium web drones . 
  oh , the hookbill having 5 mid slots is pretty darn nice . 
  dual webs * and * a shield extender make for a nice combination . 
  until yesterday , i thought they had no intention of adding high-slot target painters . 
  well , you wanted something cheaper than a drake . 
  that rules out anything t2 bigger than a frigate , and probably most of the navy cruisers as well . 
  then you specified that it should be a missile boat , which narrows the field further . 
  that leaves you with, 
  * the caracal , and, 
  i follow the blog of [ john quiggin ] ( http://johnquiggin.com/ ) and [ joshua gans et al ] ( http://economics.com.au/ ) , and they make some interesting points on political issues , often cutting to the chase of what various spending programs will actually * do * . 
  take the recent $ 42m bailout of alcoa . 
  stephen king suggests that , since we 're effectively bribing alcoa $ 70,000 for each job , why not give the money to each employee instead and let * them * decide whether their job is worth it or not ? 
  i hear that the serpentis version looks a lot like ... me . 
  west virginia . 
  there 's guides on the internet , but the short version is, 
  * get corp standing with a factions research and development corp. . 
  * train up the skills for the relevant datacores - they are also the ones used in invention jobs, 
  * talk to a r & d agent and start them making datacores for you . 
  but tbh its probably less effort to just do some minimal planetary extraction instead . 
  ** edit : ** hang on , you 're already in eve university . 
  read [ their guide ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/datacore_farming_101 ) . 
  you can cash it in , just do n't go to jita until the war ends or you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  radar sites drop them , along with decryptors , data interface bpcs and assorted other accoutrements . 
  the main source of datacores is rapidly switching to faction warfare loyalty stores , though , and prices are dropping through the floor for whichever side is winning . 
  farming the standings for r&d agents is really not a good use of one 's time at present . 
  between [ 55m and 396m ] ( http://www.mylootyourtears.com/?p=1584 ) isk per hour , apparently . 
  it 's a fleshlight for people with hexagonal dicks . 
  [ yes ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/factional_warfare_standings#actions_that_affect_standings ) . 
  considering it has been up on evenews24 for a day , then yes , it is quite safe . 
  in fact , if you 're in lawn , chances are that your * kids * are older than the typical mmo player . 
  only if we can refer to people without monocles as [ poor and irish ] ( http://www.teamfortress.com/classless/hidden/hats/ ) . 
  why do you still have an uncompact member list ? 
  i talked to marcel about this recently , and he was interested in porting eos over . 
  he [ set up ] ( https://github.com/jparks/aura ) an open-source project for the fitter , but it has n't had much love lately . 
  the problem is getting the eos code into an android library ... 
  perhaps she meant real * big * . 
  this is a good tip . 
  any idiot can learn to fake a signature . 
  the closest is guzman y gomez :(, 
  try from australia . 
  : cripes :, 
  unless there 's a sale , it 's about $ 3000 return to e.g. 
  iteron v is still useful for the viator . 
  protip for highsec miners :, 
  in a 50 % efficiency station , you only need refinery efficiency iv + ore-specific skill i to get max refining . 
  at least they 're not censoring the name on the eve-o forums any more . 
  i would eat that . 
  a lot of americans on / r/brisbane complain about the lack of mexican-style food here . 
  there will always be people joining eve who are under the mistaken impression that , like other games , ** they are the hero ** of the story . 
  it is our solemn duty to disabuse them of this idea . 
  if you get out of high-sec , you then * need * refinery efficiency v because the stations are worse efficiency . 
  ( which i think is retarded imo - null and lowsec should have the highest efficiency because ` fuck environmental laws ' ), 
  even in lowsec where it seems everyone is poor , many gangs operate on a ` if nobody dies , the logis get all the loot ' basis . 
  nope , pretty-much still the same . 
  amarr medium drones still do less damage than gallente light drones vov, 
  japanese good at kamikaze blackbirds ? 
  you do n't say . 
  asian culture has more of an emphasis on working hard to reach your goals . 
  their mmos are structured to reinforce that , because that 's what pushes their buttons . 
  eve , by contrast , is centred around being a collosal dick to other people or getting obscenely rich via underhanded practices . 
  i 'm not sure what that implies . 
  there 's a bunch of russians in outer ring called ` the ronin ' who name everything ( ships , towers , etc ) with kanji denoting their alliance name . 
  so you never can tell . 
  there already are . 
  a few of them . 
  they also [ wrote a song ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doctorin%27_the_tardis ) ( and [ a book ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_manual ) ) just to demonstrate how easy it is to make a hit single . 
  a shining example of some guys who clearly give no fucks . 
  more like hyperbollee, 
  rightclick a stack of 425mm railguns -  reprocess . 
  there 's a few military career missions that involve your ship blowing up . 
  one of them even has the agent say `` i want you to fly your ship to the enemy station , where i will blow it up to send a message to my enemy : that i have at my disposal capsuleers who truly give no fucks and they should reconsider making me annoyed . '', 
  making money in sovereign null is pretty easy . 
  find a cosmic anomaly ( there will be heaps ) , shoot at red plus signs . 
  then use the isk to buy an alliance-reimbursed ship and never need isk again . 
  do n't sell yourself short . 
  you 're not bacteria ; just a [ redshirt ] ( http://www.amazon.com/redshirts-a-novel-three-codas/dp/0765316994 ) . 
  yet you 're okay with half the dual x mm turrets only having one barrel ? 
  i suggested efficiency to iv because many ore refining skills require it . 
  my mistake . 
  it 's actually the other way around ; a lot of turrets have more barrels than you 'd expect , not fewer . 
  brb down voting myself . 
  probably better with an xlasb fit . 
  same tank , more gank . 
  do n't worry , fweddit 's got this . 
   i somehow doubt that the plex is going to make up for the several trillion in lost isk . 
  5 trillion isk buys about 800 years of plex . 
  so , no . 
  what ? 
  look at the graphs . 
  op is saying that tier 1 and 2 are / wrists for payout , and 4 and 5 are absurdly profitable from an lp point of view . 
  what this encourages is :, 
  * side a wins a bit , then leverages the wins to facerape the other side for eternity because of the fountains of lp . 
  * side b loses a bit , then finds out they ca n't afford to run the lp index tug of war and everyone ragequits . 
  this snowball effect is good in some games ( control-point games like tf2 maps etc ) where you want there to be an actual resolution , one team wins , new-round-do-it-again . 
  it 's actually a really bad thing if you want to set up a forever war . 
  imo , fw occupancy needs to be tweaked such that the lp earn rates between level 1 and level 5 are much smaller . 
  currently , each level you get to * doubles * the lp payoff . 
  something like 20 % is a lot more reasonable .
