  soundwave said that t2 plates would get +15 % more armor than rrt , but did n't say when . 
  join [ fweddit ] ( / r/fweddit ) , fly in free ships , build poasting history for dreddit access . 
  he was pretty cool in the ds9 episode set in the 1950s ... 
  be * a redditor * , instead of joing reddit just to get into corp. 
  everyone refers to mount morgan as a hole , but not for this reason . 
  i think of [ this ] ( http://www.evenews24.com/wp-content/cache/thumbs/566/133/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/game_of_drones.jpg ) instead . 
  the best thing about eve is that when you run out of time , your character still gains in power . 
  ... which is good , because my main has been playing skill training online for a few months now . 
  how much time for your blogging ? 
  you 're a machine . 
  incidentally , sites like eve-kill [ accept api keys ] ( http://eve-kill.net/?a=apikey ) to do this automatically . 
  they 're called kill reports now . 
  if you ca n't kill scramming frigates in your drake , you 'll have an even worse time killing them with a battleship . 
  newbies should always kite stuff . 
  never count on perm-tanking stuff at your skill level . 
  should have come to us for a naming competition ... 
  operate within your capabilities . 
  if this means killing their cyno frigates because that 's the only ships you can take on , so be it . 
  what is it that you 'd like to do ? 
  because killboards already exist . 
  franch , italian and spanish are ridiculously similar . 
  choosing a language because of your australian accent is a bad decision anyway . 
  if you listen to enough of that language , your accent should disappear anyway . 
  * ^ ( personally , i 'd choose spanish because more countries speak it . ), 
  keep your main combat oriented and make a station trading alt . 
  much less hassle - why spend all that time making stuff when you can just buy it cheap and sell for more ? 
   also , you get to keep your avatar 's name upon release . 
  i did not know that . 
  there are no good cloaky tengu fits . 
  there are , however , good cloaky proteus fits ( and to a lesser extent , cloaky lokis ), 
  there wo n't be isk transfer at dust launch , but ccp plans to open it up once they 're sure that the dust economy wo n't be swamped by the trillions of isk that will flow in from eve players . 
  * material rows should change color when the me slider notices they drop to zero wastage, 
  upvote for gnaa reference ~, 
  i am not sure if i want you to either . 
  so , fit two of them . 
  i 'm flying one right now . 
   in any case , using a dual asb obviously does n't remove the 60 second reload, 
  step 1 : run xlasb , tanking like a boss while cap charges are left, 
  step 2 : run second xlasb , tanking like a boss while the first one recharges . 
  uh , you 're incredibly likely to lose a bunch of isk if you intend to put down a moon mining pos to make t2 drones . 
  it 's akin to going to western australia and digging up chunks of iron ore because you 're a chef and need a new knife set to make sushi with . 
  a better use of your time would be to stockpile max-run hammerhead i blueprint copies . 
  dps tank best tank ~, 
  i like the idea ( i mean , who does n't ? 
  it 's basically windows explorer ), 
  some issues i did/still have were, 
  * fucking slow sometimes , especially with lots of containers nearby, 
  * annoying to scroll down , find some stuff then scroll the hell up to find the ship ( although in space , i just drag stuff to the cargohold icon in the hud , works great ), 
  * oh god pos modules were terrible for a while, 
  * at least we can tell which ship is the active one in hangar view now, 
  most of these things could have been iterated on if the unified inventory had been pushed to sisi earlier . 
  the lp came from thin air . 
  the isk used to buy the underpriced lp stuff did not : /, 
  according to my spreadsheet , making hammerhead iis is best done without decryptors , and makes about 1.4 m isk profit per ten-run hhii bpc . 
  the annoying thing about piloting a dread is that you have to siege up to shoot blues . 
  just clear them out with a bomb or two . 
  also hung gar and other shaolin styles . 
  the idea is that if all your blocks segue into attacks , you expend less physical * and mental * effort during each moment of a fight . 
  yeah it 's a principle of hung gar and derivatives as well . 
  missiles are a lot faster to train to t2 though . 
  you did n't mention how big your corp is . 
  ** edit : ** i ask because the last guy who asked this was trying to join major nullsec coalitions with his six-man corp. 
  sony probably has an exclusive contract with ccp to keep it ps3-only for a number of months after release . 
  there 's some suggested training plans in [ this list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) of guides . . 
  he means convincing people to spend rl money on stuff you plan to ( immediately ) take from them is a morally grey area and , depending on your country of residence , possibly illegal . 
  stealing their stuff : ** a-ok . **, 
  stealing their plexes : also ** a-ok . **, 
  convincing them to buy plex with cash so you can steal more : ** risky ** . 
  mise well give you the other link then . 
  * [ things you need to understand about eve ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ), 
  * ** tldr ; ** you are not the hero of this story, 
  rifter : flexible multi-role frigate . 
  merlin : tough shield tanked frigate . 
  there were much greater strength differences before inferno , but now , each race has a tech 1 frigate that can go head to head with the rifter . 
  explosion radius affects missile damage more than explosion velocity , so it 's generally more useful . 
  since t2 fury missiles have a very large explosion radius , you need to get that down or you wo n't even do full damage vs battleships . 
  if you 're using t1 missiles , you still have issues shooting cruisers with your missiles , so the rigors are still good to have . 
  2 rigors and one flare would be better . 
  the third rigor would be stacking nerfed to 50 % effectiveness . 
  i lost a faction fit ratting tengu a few weeks ago while reading this subreddit :-(, 
  i was posting instead of checking intel channels . 
  someone was * wrong * on the * internet * . 
  you understand . 
  i 'm not replying to him ; i 'm replying to you , when you said, 
   the asb 's main downside is the very long reload time once you 've used all the charges loaded, 
  whereupon i suggested a common way to ameliorate that . 
  if you do n't have the skills required for tech 2 invention , do n't bother . 
  if you do , then yes it 's worth doing , but you must must must choose the right rig and size to invent . 
  small trimark ii rigs have good theoretical margin but literally nobody wants to buy them . 
  as for me , i only make tech 2 rigs for personal use . 
  i use the occasional t2 resist rig . 
  if you 're flying a sleipnir , plugging that kinetic hole like ron jeremy is a good use of your isk . 
  batteries increase your maximum capacitor amount . 
  since each ship 's cap regens the same percentage regardless of its size , doubling the cap size doubles the absolute amount of cap regenerated . 
  it 's why you often see 5-launcher tengus slap on large capacitor batteries to cope with perma-running a lsb . 
  having said that , pyfa works fine . 
  a stock-standard all-5 lachesis has 1.41 kgj with +13.6 gj/s peak regen . 
  with a large cap battery ii , it has 2.28 k gj with +22.1 gj/s peak regen . 
  solution : fit a cloak to your ishtar ( offlined if need be ), 
  in other words , you have repaid his loss by providing him with compelling game content ~,
