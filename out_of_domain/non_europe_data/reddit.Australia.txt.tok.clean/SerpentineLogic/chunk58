  do they not know how to reprocess their rigs or something ? 
  copying rigs takes forever :(, 
  the next step is to stop finding opportunities , and to start * making * opportunities . 
  crash prices . 
  choke supply . 
  manipulate the market . 
  disregard women . 
  acquire currency .

  what 's horrifying is all the responses you 're trying so hard not to make . 
  turn graphics down . 
  this includes brackets . 
  heaven knows what ccp was doing with the brackets code , but turning it off makes a non trivial difference . 
  do you not post to your blog any more ? 
  your blog has an rss feed ; the others do n't ... 
  this is why you usually start a fight with null loaded ; mise well do * some * damage in until you get into antimatter range . 
  are you young ? 
  do you like to party ? 
  are you single ? 
  if so , you should be fine . 
  downhill as in ` making only a few dumptrucks full of cash ' is a far cry from downhill as in ` john carter ' . 
  signature radius : 50 m, 
  speed 0 m/s, 
  so assuming you have no explosion radius rigs :, 
  scourge fury = 192 * 50 / 215 = 44.65 damage . 
  scourge precision = 130 * 50 / 112 = 58 damage, 
  faction scourge = 172 * 50 / 125 = 68.8 damage, 
  ( rigs will give you more damage across the board , but wo n't change the ranking ), 
  fury is good for big stuff , which this turret is n't . 
  precision is good for * small and fast * stuff , which this turret is n't . 
  standard missiles are best for small , stationary stuff , because the higher damage more than compensates for the bad sig radius . 
   how will you start a chain of schools ? 
  the same way chain restaurants do it . 
  one school at a time . 
  ironically , some societies put so much emphasis on education that it becomes too important to pass the exam to risk the time learning the concepts instead of concentrating on rote learning . 
   i just ca n't prove it . 
  middlemen are trusted because we know their reputation is important to them than scamming a single third-party transaction . 
  no offense , but you do n't have enough of a reputation . 
  capital ships , t2 modules . 
  t2 ammo for when i do n't feel like logging in for a week . 
  it 's possible to go from a new character to [ 80 billion ] ( http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com.au/ ) in the course of three months doing trading . 
  uh , this *** is *** the non-test eve subreddit . 
  you know what ? 
  let 's just start putting '' / r/evemarketplace '' in the description of public courier contracts and see whether anyone picks them up . 
  actually , it 's so we can search on that string , ha . 
  in other news , south africa is * full * of south africans . 
  also signal amplifiers in the low slots , and scan resolution rigs . 
  target painters wo n't work , since they only turn on when you already have a lock . 
  they can be used to help out other ships that have n't locked it yet though . 
  most of syndicate is one jump freighter from high sec . 
  not much opportunity there , unless that station is heavily populated . 
  people in highsec will haul for 50k per jump . 
  it 's crazy low . 
  fweddit has a hauling corp. . talk to them and maybe you can pick up the highsec portion of the runs . 
  probably do n't need the extender if you do n't plan on shooting anyone . 
  since i am terrible at aiming , being able to place [ redacted ] using a [ redacted ] will be awesome . 
  of course there is the matter of the one-time 500m creating new eve subreddit fee . 
  all the skills you need to fly a caracal will transfer to a drake , except caldari cruiser v. 
  it is due to change to cruiser iv in the next few months . 
  t2 launchers also fire scourge fury , which is a flat 30 percent increase in dps . 
  regardless , two t2 rigors and some t1 or faction ammo should pop frigates qute handily . 
  gone , thanks . 
  fweddit is a bit more relaxed . 
  everyone is a spy anyway , so why be picky ? 
  once you fit scorch , you will realise just how good lasers are . 
  no they 're not . 
  larger missiles are n't dependent on smaller missile specialisation like guns are . 
  i like the silhouette of the mittani in the second one . 
  very subtle . 
  you want us to do your homework for you ? 
  choosing a random nullsec system like [ nalvula ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/nalvula/kills ) , you can see that there 's a couple of pirate corporations active , apparently picking off level 5 mission runners . 
  so , if you want in on it , talk to them and see if you can fly with them for a bit and maybe they 'll offer to recruit you . 
  `` it 's like rwanda , but with spaceships '' . 
  the crown has as much influence over australia as it does to france . 
  we fought in a war once , and now battle it out using sports . 
  well , you could * play it * ? 
  it 's a [ quote ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/warhammer_40,000:_dawn_of_war ) . 
  you probably want a [ retriever ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/retriever ) then . 
  just be prepared to warp out in < 0.7 sec space , since it probably does n't have enough tank to kill rats before its shields are gone ( unless you fit a civilian shield booster , and even then it might be dicey ), 
  depends on the race of ships you prefer . 
  ** gallente : **, 
  * brutix for in-your-face blaster fits ( does best in pvp ), 
  * myrmidon for people who like to ` send in de drones ' ( plus pve ), 
  * ferox for in-your-face blaster fits ( does best in pvp , especially with ancillary shield booster ), 
  * drake for a tough missile platform with decent range ( does well in pvp and excellent in pve ), 
  * prophecy for tanky lasers with not much damage output ( best for bait ships in pvp ), 
  * harbinger for bonused lasers with not as much tanking ( best in pvp and pve ), 
  * cyclone for okay dps and strong shield tank ( mixed guns/missiles ), 
  * hurricane for good dps and shield or armor tank ( mostly guns ) . 
  either are fairly ok for pve , but the cane is generally better in pvp . 
  for you , i suggest upgrading to a [ shield rupture ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/minmatar_basic_ship_and_skill_guide#rupture.2c_pve_t2_shield ) for a bit , then probably a [ pve shield cane ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/minmatar_basic_ship_and_skill_guide#hurricane.2c_basic_pve ) . 
  probably not a good idea to advertise where your squishy non-combat ships will be undocked for hours on end . 
  if you 're mining in a group , then the rats will probably die fairly quickly to the massed drones of the entire fleet , so you 'll be ok ( also , the squad leader should be watching everyone 's shield total and should warp the squad out if you start taking too much damage ), 
  you may also end up in a [ covetor ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/covetor ) , which mines more than a retriever . 
  regardless , the mining ships are to be rebalanced in the next 3-6 months so you 'll likely find the new versions to be significantly tougher . 
  players usually gain skill points at a rate of ~ 20 million points per year . 
  usually they 're flying with +3 implants , which will make a fair bit of difference . 
  the perennial problem of the low-sec pirate is finding targets . 
  you advertising that a certain system is home to a mining fleet makes you more of a target .
