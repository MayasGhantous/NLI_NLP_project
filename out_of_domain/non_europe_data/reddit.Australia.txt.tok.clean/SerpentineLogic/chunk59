  still , it 's not a bad place to mine , all things considered , due to its location . 
  as far as training goes , there 's not really anything in between . 
  ** tldr ; ** newbee goons are taught to be assholes ; assholes win wars because they are n't held back by e-honoure . 
  oh , yeah , always make sure you 're training something and have  24 hours of skills queued up . 
  put something like mining v at the end of your queue and just throw a few skills on the front whenever you login . 
  btw it 's probably a good idea to start an entirely new character if you want to get into combat . 
  keeping industry and pvp skills on separate characters is a very good idea . 
  actually , if you subscribe using a code you got via steam ( i.e. 
  probably the $ 5 code ) then you wo n't get the plex . 
  for a number of reasons :, 
  * no skills overlap, 
  * combat/piloting skills and science/support skills are totally different attributes, 
  * manufacturing , planetary processing and research jobs tie you to a specific location , which conflicts with combat operations, 
  * as a corollary to this , if your php character is camped in station or otherwise unavailable , having a separate character that you can login instead and do some mining or whatever in a totally different solar system is nice . 
  if you only have one character , you 're sol . 
  * later , when you consider having another account , you 'll find that the support abilities of an industry character ( primarily orca , remote repair and scanning ) are really great to have access to . 
  if all those skills are on the same character as your combat character , you 're stuck . 
  * implant usage is completely different , which is a massive pain in the ass to swap between, 
  does n't matter how many accounts , do n't mix industry and combat . 
  yes ; completely separate - they can even be in separate corporations ( ofc you can contract stuff or give isk to them as normal ) . 
  many people have purchasing alts in a nearby trade hub , so they can buy stuff they need and set up courier transports to send stuff to their main . 
  then * they * can fucking pay for it . 
  you 're just crying paw . 
  a [ few things ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  mate , try au tz for fights :(, 
  practically all i do is reff stuff before the russians login . 
  then again , i do get to logon after downtime and find all the faction spawns ... 
  tried agony empire ? 
  interestingly , they used rice flour as an additive in the cement used between stones in the great wall . 
  turns out it makes for a really , really good cement , presumably why it 's still good so many centuries later . 
  that 's a phallusy . 
  edit your flair - , 
  not eve , it seems . 
  perhaps x3 would be more up his alley . 
  you may like to try faction warfare . 
  it offers pvp in cheap ships , and the opportunity to gain a fair amount of loyalty points for the amarr empire , which can be cashed in for valuable prizes . 
  reddit has a fw corporation , although i ca n't vouch for whether your wife would be okay with the , uh , jocular nature of their chat channels . 
  read [ the manual ] ( http://www.isktheguide.com ) first . 
  without it , you wo n't even [ understand ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ) the [ other advice ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) we give . 
  some guides , you say ? 
  [ i got this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) . 
  any update ? 
  still curated by you , or open slather ? 
  there 's, 
  * [ house of serenitydot ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/house+of+serenity . ), 
  which is lowsec piracy, 
  * [ sons of alexander ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/sons+of+alexander ) which is 75 % kiwis & aussies ( my corp yay ! ), 
  * [ centrelink australia ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/centrelink+australia ) , which is 100 % mad cunts ^ ( tm ), 
  * i think [ kangaroos with frikkin lazerbeams ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/kangaroos_with_frickin_lazerbeams ) is mostly aussie, 
  * [ c0nvicted ] ( http://evewho.com/alli/c0nvicted ) alliance , which has a lot of australian corps in it . 
  * oh yeah , [ anzac alliance ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/anzac%20alliance ) is obviously chock full of aussies . 
  * i also know a few mining and industry corps . 
  pm me for info . 
  ** edit : ** btw , they 're all decent corps or alliances . 
  surprisingly few people in autz are shit at this game . 
  then again , you just saved yourself $ 12.50 so that 's halfway to a plex anyway . 
  the fact that you 've realised these ( fairly fundamental ) concepts already puts you in the top 50 % of pilots . 
  consider reading the altruist 's know your enemy series for more info in the same vein . 
  come for the internet spaceships , stay for the gonewild .

  ok , i 'll wait for it to be made un-private . 
  tactical weapon reconfiguration v ( am currently a scrub since i still have 20hrs left on twr iv ), 
  looks like the even-numbered groups will be pretty tough matchups , and the odd-numbered groups having a lot of cripplefights . 
  so , you like artillery ? 
  then let me introduce you to the 280mm thrasher : a weapon for a more civilized age . 
  flying with 280s are eve 's equivalent to clay pigeon shooting with friends at an english country manor , while eating hor d'oeuvres from wedgewood china plates . 
  except the clay pigeons are really pods . 
  and the friends are really neckbeards . 
  and the food is really cheetos . 
  hmm . 
  you know all the social niceties that prevent people from being assholes in real life ? 
  you know , like not queue jumping , or randomly stealing money left on your friends ' coffee tables etc. 
  eve does n't have that . 
  neither do the players . 
  this is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  there is real knowledge to be gained by playing eve that translates directly to real life , and you 've just been on the receiving end of some . 
  bear with me here ... 
  ** you got kicked for being too annoying . 
  ** think about that . 
  irl , people ( including your friends and family ) put up with a lot of shit from other people . 
  in eve , the players do n't have to be so polite . 
  i 'm not saying you * are * annoying , but now you know it might be true . 
  ** you got scammed . 
  ** most people irl work under the assumption that everyone is a nice person . 
  * eve players know better * . 
  they see a setup like lyoness and think ` that 's just a rl version of iskbank ' . 
  they react with the appropriate level of suspicion when they encounter strangers trying to sell stuff for cheap , because they 've been burned before . 
  if it only took 500 million isk worth of imaginary currency for you to learn this critically-important lesson , then it 's the most value for money you 'll ever get , in-game or out of it . 
  ** tldr ; ** eve is n't unfriendly , your problem is thinking real life * is n't * . 
  a [ few things ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  i guess the obvious question to ask is : what 's in it for the people you recruit ? 
  \\* * scrolls down one screen * \\*, 
  \\* * sees model wearing a gold monocle * \\*, 
  you 'll fit right in . 
  that sounds like a recipe for disaster ... 
  yes , that 's * exactly * it . 
  tinfoil -  that way .
