  yeah i used to run a similar setup in nullsec , outputting 288 robotics a day . 
  sometimes a bit of a hassle trucking the p1 about though . 
  i have said this before , but even without extraction , [ planetary manufacturing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) can be quite profitable , even with low amounts of skillpoints ( about 250k sp ) , provided you are n't terrible with spreadsheets . 
  i have some setups in lowsec that look [ like this ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pi_factories.png ) that make * quite * a lot of money ( when i can be bothered refilling them ), 
  guys , there 's a difference between an alt * character * and an alt * account * . 
  alt characters are awesome ; i have one stationed in jita to check market prices and buy stuff , and another for industry and hauling ( never do industry on your combat character ), 
  however , an alt * account * is a bigger deal , and generally is n't worth it for the first few months you play . 
  hmm , guess that pays for a plex then . 
  skunkworks was doing agile development before it was cool . 
  anecdotally , this is why large groups of asians are always skinny - \u03b2-thalassemia . 
  a few things :, 
  * do n't fly a hulk in w-space , because you 'll keep losing them . 
  fly covetors instead . 
  * buy a bunch of compressed veldspar ( or just trit ) on market and haul that in to supplement your mining . 
  it 's really not a good use of your time to be chewing on low-ends when you can be stripping a signature of high-ends instead . 
  meh , people roll without drone interfacing , logistics or < x  warfare specialization v. skill training is like that . 
  c ) the police take a look , find out something unrelated , like a survival knife in the glove box , damaged handbrake that is * potentially * unsafe , ` suspicious ' pictures of your friend 's kids going swimming , that you were meaning to upload to flickr for them and then you 're * fucked * . 
  all gunnery and missile skills are per/will . 
  most spaceship skills are per/will , except for tech 2 piloting skills which are will/per . 
  so yeah , go per primary/will secondary over keeping it equal . 
  high perception also helps with navigation skills .

  providence is good ; the npc nullsec areas like curse and venal are less friendly , and the rest of sovereign null is downright hostile . 
  agreed . 
  the way they 're fixing this is a [ massive buff ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/neural-remaps-buffed/ ) to remaps . 
  there are advanced camera controls in the eve client btw . 
  hmm , your friend was right to ragequit . 
  that 's a terrible fit . 
  he should at least have had the decency to fly a loki if he was going to pack in that much deadspace stuff . 
  which is all well and good , but generally speaking , if your modules cost a billion isk more than your ship , then it 's time to get a better ship . 
  i believe you . 
  ecm burst . 
  does n't need to lock , does n't need a high slot . 
  you should start a new topic about that . 
  [ quite relevant ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-philosophy-of-passive-income ) . 
  for me , the reasons were manifest and manifold :, 
  * pi ties you to a set of systems, 
  * similarly , manufacturing and science rely on blueprints and materials being in a certain spot to work, 
  * my sec status is slowly dropping on my main , which is not a good thing when i have hauling in highsec to do, 
  * aside from spaceship skills and fitting skills , there 's no skill overlap between what my main does and what my industry alt finds useful . 
  * two accounts means i can cyno with one and move a capital ship with the other . 
  technically , this works both ways since both of them can light cynos , but i do n't have a jump freighter to put my alt in . 
  i only created an industry alt after playing for a year or so . 
  i figured i had enough isk for a year 's subscription , so why not cash some of it in for a power of two account ? 
  my industry alt remapped to perception so i could do all the pre-reqs for jump freighting , before remapping int/mem for actual industry skills . 
  if you want an orca instead , it gets a bit annoying because of the mixed prerequisite chain to get them , but imo if you 're going to go for an orca , aim to get into a rorqual as well , since the skill training is 80 % similar . 
  depends . 
  there 's always long waits for copying and me research , but invention slots are fairly easy to come by . 
  the first trading i did in eve was supplying other noobs with the minerals needed to do the tutorial missions , and buying the random mission loot they had . 
  this is why they have anger issues later in life . 
  i almost do this every . 
  single . 
  day .

  ec ** all ** the p8rs !, 
  maybe they 'll have melee weapons so you can use one while people shoot at you with guns with actual range . 
  you know , the true gallente short-range experience . 
  [ as requested ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/playstationblogeurope/6471029435/ ) . 
  jita undock was changed to be ridiculously large precisely to prevent smartbombing shenanigans . 
  perimeter outgate is still a-ok tho . 
  i wouldnt go that far . 
  either stealth bomber or uncloaked t3 , depending on mission . 
  well , mostly it 's because the longer you 're killing mission rats , the longer you 're out there being unsafe . 
  far better to lay on the dps , fit some eccm to pare down your signature ( the low-grade sensor strength implant set is cheap , get it ) and just go balls to the wall . 
  sure . 
  shield fleets love basilisk pairs . 
  if you decide to train for a scimitar or whatever , all your logi skills will transfer over . 
  yes , it still does . 
  however , it 's impossible to be completely unprobable now , especially with the boost to sisters launchers that 's in the pipeline . 
  eccm does give you a bit more time to react once you see probes on scan , since they might need extra scans to winnow your position . 
  also works a treat vs guristas rats . 
  anything tech 2 caldari or gallente should be able to waltz through all serpentis anomalies . 
  sometimes i did n't even turn my tengu 's shield booster on . 
  basically , it boils down to whether you want gallente cruiser v or caldari cruiser v the most , since the drone skills and missile skills are a wash as far as applicability and time to train . 
  tried australia ? 
  your qualifications allow you an instant working visa . 
  i 'd love you more if the gas prices were imported from eve-central . 
  something like this will do the trick , once you find the itemid ( e.g. 
  the itemid of c540 is 30378 ), 
  = importxml ( concatenate ( `` http://api.eve-central.com/api/marketstat?regionlimit=10000002&amp;typeid= '' , $ a1 ) , '' / / sell/min '' ),

  yes it does . 
  all the smart kids do this .
