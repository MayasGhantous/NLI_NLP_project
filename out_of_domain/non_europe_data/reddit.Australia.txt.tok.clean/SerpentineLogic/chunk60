  which is why it 's called `` the spod '' , not the spot . 
  i 'm not sure whether your opinions are representative of americans , but i think you give your democratic party way too much credit to be that organised . 
  no jump freighter is safe !, 
  oh , you 're one of those people . 
  does n't matter ; had bath, 
  sounds kinky . 
  i 'm in . 
  you 're misunderstanding the situation with ship bonuses . 
  a ferox does n't give 5 x 10 % optimal range bonuses for having battlecruisers v ; it gives a * single * +50 % bonus . 
  the same goes with skills , and any other variable effect . 
  all skills , implants , ship bonuses and combat booster effects are multiplicative . 
  all percentage-based module and rig effects are multiplicative , but may be stacking-penalized for having multiple effects . 
  this is why most people do n't fit more than three damage-boosting modules - the fourth module would be stacking-nerfed down to 25 % effectiveness . 
  the only skill that is multiplicative based on * each skill level * instead of additive is margin trading . 
  look them up on http://www.evewho.com, 
  i got left in venal once . 
  still have a jump clone there . 
  you do n't even need to go that far . 
  the different diets between northern and southern chinese led to wildly-different average sizes , which is why you often see the hamburger-fed children of chinese immigrants towering two feet above their parents . 
   mythbusters is great . 
  especially since they have a walrus co-presenting the show . 
  never not trust showinfo . 
  the drones ui is fairly terrible ( tip : most people use keyboard bindings for it ) . 
  however , like the science/industry , pos and corporate management interfaces , it 's on the list to be fixed . 
  working out which ones to launch ( you do have your drones grouped into folders , do n't you ? ), 
  is the bit they have n't worked out how to do effectively , which is why it does n't have a shortcut i imagine . 
  according to [ the qen ] ( http://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/qen/qen_q3-2010.pdf ) , the average wallet size in 2010 was 350m isk . 
  i think once i got to 6 accounts , i 'd just say ` fuck it . 
  ** dreddit ** does n't scam redditors . 
  other corps in test may have ... subtly different interpretations . 
  fa is so hardcore they do n't even [ fit their ships ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=13936456 ) . 
  it might seem harsh that you ca n't trade your in-game currency for out-of-game goods , but it 's for a good reason . 
  eve is a brutal enough game without incentivising players to use all tactics at their disposal to acquire in-game currency ( probably off other players ) . 
  if it were legalised , i think you 'll find a number of eve players buy ** apartment blocks ** from their stockpile of spacebucks . 
   no one wants to jump through 60 gates w/o action, 
  hey , i just und\u043ecked, 
  and this is crazy, 
  but here 's our fleet comp, 
  so fight us \u201a mayb\u0435 ? 
  rampart . 
  slope incoming ... 
  next up : making supercarriers bigger . 
  the fact that they need to be in siege mode to provide bonuses makes it a bit risky . 
  rorqs are n't that expensive , but they 're not really worth the bonus compared to an orca if you risk losing them all the time . 
  richard kane-ferguson is my fave . 
  i suddenly feel the urge to play star control ii . 
  eve-kill really needs a way to sort cargo by value . 
  * everything to iv, 
  * only use scourge fury on battleships and battlecruisers, 
  the technical term is ` refractory period ' . 
  i wonder for how long . 
  so does julian assange . 
  it 's a national pastime .

  i do n't think a drake can fit bigger drones , while still fielding a full set of five . 
  i do n't see what 's surprising about goons helping goons . 
  when i do the whole ` split a buddy plex ' thing , i do n't give the newbie all of it in cash - i make sure they get a set of +3 s and a t1 non-shitfit cruiser , because i do n't believe new players know enough about the game to make good decisions on how to spend their isk . 
  evemon will tell you the immediate requirements of any fit ( not just a ship hull ) but it wo n't tell you about the ancillary skills required to not get killed . 
  you should work out how you 're going to make isk with your alt before you start one . 
  so , move systems . 
  i do n't see what the problem is . 
  the only stuff you are risking is the implants in your null sec jump clone , and whatever ships you buy or ship down there , which is probably limited to a couple battlecruisers and a stealth bomber for the first month or so . 
  true story : i used to live in a low-sec pocket in maroubra . 
  so why sell it now ? 
  you can always jump clone back and dispose of it later if you need the cash . 
  unless you 're moving to syndicate , living in null-sec is an income - * positive * activity . 
  one is a nation state ; the other is a sporting team . 
  perhaps he 's counting their spais . 
  check out east khanid trading . 
  i would like to see the amarr cut off the high sec connections to minmatar space . 
  ditto caldari and gallente . 
  he tends to make changes first and think about knock-on effects later . 
  that 's less than ideal . 
  * [ a post about tanking ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/s1qp4/passive_armor_vs_passive_shield_tanking/c4ae8hr ), 
  also , as long as you do n't fit expensive rigs , you have n't permanently lost the isk used to fit it , since when you want a different ship , you can strip the vexor for parts . 
  the knock-on effect of needing a combat-capable ship to run minor plexes instead of ` afterburner , rep , no guns ' will be interesting . 
   i had hoped for a marginally faster reload time , as most fights are over before the 60 second reload timer is up, 
  that 's the *** point *** . 
  i would love the ability to assign manufacturing or research contracts to people . 
  at present i have to contract them the materials , but then they have to remember to return the finished product afterwards . 
  in fact , they 're probably just a more specialised version of a general ' i give you stuff , then x days later , you give me different stuff ' contract . 
  i wish corp wallets had an option ` guarantee withdrawals from personal wallet ' . 
  that way , when i 'm spending from my corp wallet , if it reaches zero , any other purchases get taken from my personal wallet . 
  makes for much easier administration of research and manufacturing corporations , since you can leave a wallet division at zero and let each person pay for their own jobs automatically . 
   for pos 's will ccp add faction towers and mods back in ? 
  only if they 're banned in highsec . 
  i mean , seriously , why would the caldari state ever allow a dread guristas tower in their space ? 
  which pi materials in particular ? 
  you probably will go over cpu with low skills , so fit large azeotropic extenders instead of tech 2 . 
  if you 're still hard-pressed for cpu , you can try one of the various flavours of tech 1 damage controls . 
  nah , he probably just plays eve online . 
  no , i just believe that being an invincible god of tanking for 52/112 ^ th of the time is actually pretty good value from a single mid slot and leave it at that . 
  a cheap ` geddon would work . 
  large processor overclocking rigs are pretty cheap . 
  let 's see , something like this :, 
  [ armageddon , cheap as bro ], 
  large armor repairer ii, 
  damage control ii, 
  heat sink ii,
