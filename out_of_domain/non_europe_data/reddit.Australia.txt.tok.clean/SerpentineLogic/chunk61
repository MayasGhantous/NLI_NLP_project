  * downgrade to t1 guns if necessary ( but not recommended - scorch is that good ), 
  * add rigs according to what you can afford . 
  capacitor control circuits are a good choice , since it allows you to replace the cap power relays with something better . 
  * adjust hardeners to taste, 
  * fill the drone bay with medium and a couple of heavy drones, 
  * ** do not fly this ship if you ca n't t2 fit every module on it . 
  maybe you should fit some resists then . 
  i especially like the information warfare links in a supercap fleet . 
  because they 're so likely to be jammed or damped ... 
  that 's like when i undock in a taranis . 
  i know * someone * is going home in a pod . 
  & nbsp ; ^ & nbsp ; ^ \\ ( usually & nbsp ; me \\ ), 
  not sure if trolling or just sperglord . 
  this conversation is over . 
  the dominix and rattlesnake are the kings of ` warp in , deploy drones , alt-tab ' mission running due to sentry drones . 
  even then , they have to watch their drones in case they aggress a group of rats before you 've had a chance to shoot them first . 
  having said that , the geddon is a good analog in the amarr ship lineup , since it has a large drone bay and pulse lasers can clean up anything that gets in range . 
  you do , however , have to pay a bit more attention to shoot stuff before it gets too close , but there 's certainly no need to be kiting the stuff you 're shooting at , or worrying about running out of cap for your tank like you do in a raven . 
  t2 scorch pulse crystals are * so good * you wo n't know what you did without them . 
  i believe that falls into the `` nda 'd to hell '' category . 
  it 's all on his blog . 
  he even occasionally ` blogs away his profit ' where he tells everyone what he has been doing lately , and how he 's now too rich to bother in that market . 
  confirming that your wallet balance is a convenient way to keep score , at least for a while . 
  much like real life , really . 
  you should petition a moderator to get a ccp flair . 
  many programmers are . 
  most of the time they spend is thinking about what code to write , rather than actually typing it , so they never gain typing specialisation iv . 
  if you want to learn how to type , get on irc and try to keep up with a witty banter competition . 
  or mudsexing . 
  so i hear ... 
  the skills required for a rorqual have 75 % overlap with the skills required to fly a hulk , so you can reship into whichever ship your corp needs the most fairly easily . 
  re the clone vat bay : clone vats are a great way for players to get jump clones if they do n't have standings . 
  you fly to the rorqual , install a clone , fly back to a station , and clone jump into the one in the rorq . 
  the rorq can then log out , leaving you with a jump clone back at the station . 
  the rorq requires mining skills to get into , and manufacturing skills to use the industrial core . 
  ( the number of assembly lines you use is not as important as production efficiency v ), 
  however , the refining skills are n't a huge issue since they 're also required to fit mining crystals . 
  i suspect that there will be a capital mining barge released in the next 12-18 months , so the jump drive skills required for a rorq wo n't be wasted . 
  rail nagas generally do n't use t2 ammo - antimatter hits fine up to 50km with 425mm rails , and i carry some thorium for the 100km band . 
  i do carry arround some t2 spike ammo , but that 's just for that pesky 200-250km range band where other ammo types are n't really good at . 
  should you use large blasters , though , you will love love love null , because you can hit stuff from so much further away ( then switch quickly to antimatter when you get close ), 
  if you ca n't t2-fit any ship larger than a cruiser ( aside from the guns , which many people skimp on , to their detriment ) , then you probably should n't be flying that ship . 
  most of those modules only require level iv in a skill that you should already have trained up a bit ( a few , like the repper , are a bit of a slog ) . 
  all those +5 % per level bonuses add up to a much more resilient and effective ship than when they 're lacking . 
  skimp on those support skills and you 'll find that you 're flying at 40 % of the effectiveness of a better-skilled pilot , and that will directly lead to ship losses and failed missions . 
  blasters are for very short range engagements . 
  small blasters are quite good , since you 're in a small agile ship anyway so getting into range is no problem . 
  medium blasters are an issue , since the range advantage of projectiles and lasers starts to become noticable at this size . 
  large blasters have decent range ( in small fleet pvp , any range you have beyond warp disruptor range is semi-wasted ) ; the problem is getting your ship close enough . 
  this is why players like the talos - it can easily fly within 15km and unload antimatter onto any target due to being quite zippy . 
  the blaster naga is used in a similar manner , although it tends to have a stronger tank but lacks drones to shake off frigates ( which is why you fit a web instead ) . 
   minerals are a pain to move, 
  \\* cough \\* 425mm rails \\* cough \\*, 
  you can even ask people to set up a key according to your specifications . 
  for instance , if you want applicants for your corp to give you their api key , just get them to [ go here ] ( https://support.eveonline.com/api/key/createpredefined/61607755 ) and give you the key they created . 
  or finding time to study instead of being knackered from doing a paper run after school to help pay the bills . 
  : cough : lost : cough :, 
  realistically , you 're not going to be using large railguns for months . 
  start with a [ 125mm railgun cormorant ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/caldari_basic_ship_and_skill_guide#cormorant.2c_basic_missions ) and work your way up . 
  unfortunately , i consider the caldari railgun cruiser and battlecruiser to be fairly weak , which is probably why many caldari players switch to heavy missile platforms for those ship classes . 
  should have gone up to each worker and said `` there 's $ 70,000 in this bag . 
  should i give your company three of these bags and they 'll let you keep your job , maybe , or do i give one bag to you and tell them to fuck off ? '', 
  depends whether you 're doing highsec suicide-piracy , or lowsec/w-space surprise buttsex piracy . 
  in the land of high-sec , the 8-gun [ tornado is king ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=14002360 ) . 
  in low-sec , any race 's battlecruisers will do fine . 
  i think you can link them together without submitting . 
  i used to run pi on my macbook . 
  it seemed to work fine . 
  i enjoyed the fact that they later added double-click effects to a bunch of stuff to speed things up . 
  burn level : tchaikovsky, 
  so in other words , they have the easy bit down pat , but suck at the actual hard part . 
  +1 , insightful, 
  not to be confused with the international federation [ actually * called * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_taekwon-do_federation ) the international taekwondo federation , which appears to be less about tkd as sport and more as tkd the martial art . 
  a number of reasons . 
  ccp has stated that they will only introduce capital ships if there is a reason for them . 
  i think that point will be reached sooner rather than later , because, 
  * it 's a great flagship feature for an industrial-themed expansion . 
  * it provides a ship progression for a hulk pilot . 
  the skill tree for mining is currently way too shallow for a game with ppl playing since 2003 . 
  * it wo n't be usable in high-sec , so it can always be shot at if it undocks, 
  * it facilitates nullsec 's independence from highsec , giving them the flexibility to tackle nullsec logistics . 
  do n't underestimate how important this is for backwaters like omist .
