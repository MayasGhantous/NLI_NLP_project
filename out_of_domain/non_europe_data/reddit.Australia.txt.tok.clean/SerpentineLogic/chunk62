  * it provides another way for alliances to get resources ( via refining fees ) in a timely manner , instead of relying on moon goo, 
  * it is a great hot drop target , just like ratting carriers - it 's a ready-made ` farm and field ' for roamers to burn , and defenders to protect . 
  you can get lactose-free milk . 
  all they need to do is put a quart of lactase into the milk vat before they bottle it . 
  it all depends on what their reaction is when they see something awful on the internet . 
  one group posts on forums about it . 
  the other group says ` meh , i already read it ' . 
  and now you know .

  some people even eat their * flesh * while literally holding onto their rib bones . 
  it is . 
  that 's why the only naturally-dark-skinned ethnic groups in sub-arctic regions are those who get their vitamin d from diet ( fish fats etc ) .

  tbh i 'd rather have the $ 10 . 
  i talked to a guy when i was in bali , a few months after the 2002 bombings ( it 's a weird feeling to walk down a totally empty bali street . 
  i bought a hat on my last day and the woman said that i was the only tourist she 'd seen in two days ), 
  anyway , his monthly salary as a goverment lifesaver was something in the order of $ 35 . 
  think about what temptation to accept bribes someone in that situation would be in , and you begin to understand how deep into the society it can go . 
  can you use it to make more money ? 
  if yes , keep . 
  if not , sell and buy something that can . 
  in this case , he 'll be more sad from losing it than he would enjoy using it , so it 's a no-brainer . 
  perhaps you 've heard of the kiss song `` i was made for hot dropping testies ( they were made for welping fleets ) '' ?

  plex is one of the top ten most-traded market items . 
   the argument has been made that it is in ccp 's best interest for the price of plex to stay up, 
  ccp is also mindful that veteran eve players are, 
  * the most likely group to use plex for subscription fees, 
  * also the most likely group to provide interesting game content for others, 
  so they ca n't really afford to piss off old players the way a ` churn and burn ' f2p mmo can . 
  plying the victim with what ? 
  i see what you did there . 
  it only works on new accounts , and if you convert a buddy trial from the steam code , you wo n't get the plex . 
  ^ ( believe me , i 've tried ), 
  they 're the same thing . 
  i prefer the non-steam version , since updating it is less of a hassle . 
  eve has an updater anyway , it 'll download whatever it needs after each patch . 
  the [ repair tool ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/client_repair_tool ) is also pretty awesome . 
  all it needs is repair.exe in the direct directory and it will download anything that 's missing or corrupted . 
  really useful if there 's something screwy with your install and you do n't feel like redownloading . 
   it 's like santa claus brought me a naked supermodel for my birthday . 
  only if the naked supermodel aggresses people randomly , does n't do what you tell her , and always gets left in the parking lot when you drive back from the shops .

  or against it . 
  yes , because you can bring your entire corp along , and theoretically make some isk . 
  you will notice your faction standings change and be shot at in highsec a lot more . 
  hope that 's ok . 
  i defer to your experience ~, 
  many drone boats do twice as much drone dps compared to turret dps , so this is a straight upgrade for them . 
  it 's especially good for the rattlesnake , since it can now roll with a 3/3 bcs/dda split and really put out the hurt . 
  so far , there are really only three ways to make money from an mmo, 
  * sheer volume of players ( pioneered by wow ), 
  * chasing the ` whale ' users ( pioneered by pay2win games ), 
  * retaining veterans for years ( pioneered eve ),

  we have one pretty solid rule here in test diplomacy - do n't scam on your main . 
  apparently that is too hard . 
  mumble07 is removed from test diplomats .

  cobalt/platinum would be better . 
  never not rush 90b isk scams . 
  you must be new here ( to life ), 
  i 'd pay you 90 isk to keep out ,

  it 's not a good idea to have mining specialisation on a combat character btw .

  you 'll be transferring from cargo hold to can or orca more than once a minute , though , which might get old fast . 
  assuming you have the cargo space ... 
  which timezones ? 
  uh , trading does n't attract corp taxes .

  being in a scorpion along with thirty of your closest mates is pretty good . 
  being the only guy in a scorpion is not so good . 
  scorpions are always primary targets . 
  if your fleet does n't have enough of them to fill a dedicated electronic warfare squad or wing , you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  tldr ; ask the fc for fleet composition before you rock up with a scorp . 
  i saw that video . 
  would not recommend . 
  it 's because otherwise , nobody would employ teenagers . 
  minimum wage laws are a compromise between no regulation , which adds to employment but leads to abusive practices , and a too-high minimum wage , which means that anyone who gets a job can afford to live off it , but others are left out of work because of high wage costs . 
  the australian minimum wage is a bit on the high side , but it 's not a huge drag on the economy , due to some well-crafted exceptions ( fruit picking iirc ), 
  it 's hard to get a gun in the first place . 
  that 's why australians use knives . 
  or chainsaws . 
  whatever 's handy . 
  on the plus side , bananas are pretty easy to grow in most of australia . 
  tldr ; immigration and why it 's great for first-world countries .
