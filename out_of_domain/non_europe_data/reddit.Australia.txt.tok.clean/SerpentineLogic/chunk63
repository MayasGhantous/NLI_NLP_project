   ** aliastra ** purchased a large fleet of catalysts several years ago , to protect its inter-empire shipping routes . 
  subsequent evaluations determined that the catalyst was considerably over-gunned for many of its safer routes , so 30 % of their hulls were sold off and replaced by cheaper frigates . 
  some of these ships have since been retro-fitted for capsuleer use , and their distinctive color scheme makes them something of a collector 's item . 
  ( color scheme unknown ), 
   ** inner zone shipping ** 's main claim to fame is as the bank of luminaire 's preferred courier for high-value shipments . 
  catalysts are their preferred escort craft , combining high speed and maneuverability with an extremely heavy punch . 
  for its highest-value runs , izs prefers to use brand-new hulls , which are then immediately sold off after use to prevent unscrupulous elements from tracking their id numbers . 
  while most of these ships are repainted and sold as stock , inner zone has discovered a lucrative sideline in selling a few on to capsuleer collectors , who place a premium on ships with interesting histories . 
  ( color scheme : yellow + black ??? ), 
   the ** intaki syndicate ** fields large numbers of catalysts as deep-space patrol craft . 
  its heavy armament lets it punch well above their weight , and its expansive cargo bay allows it to cruise for months between supply stops . 
  recently though , the syndicate has retired a considerable number of its older hulls , with rumors suggesting their imminent replacement by a newer destroyer design . 
  regardless , their extensive military service gives them particular cachet among capsuleer collectors . 
  ( color scheme : dark blue + light grey ), 
   ostensibly a civilian transport corporation , ** interbus ** claims it possesses no military capabilities . 
  despite this , small numbers of catalyst hulls bearing the corporation 's distinctive yellow color scheme continue to circulate among capsuleers . 
  interbus has thus far declined to make any comment on their provenance , which if anything has raised their value among collectors . 
  ( color scheme : yellow + black ), 
   in its continuing campaign to gain 100 % brand awareness , ** quafe ** is constantly looking for new ways to draw attention . 
  one of their recent successes has been the distribution of limited-edition quafe ships to eager capsuleers , and this catalyst is one of their latest offerings . 
  while functionally just a stock catalyst , this ship 's iridescent blue paint job and prominent quafe logos makes it a highly sought-after collector 's item - as well as an unmissable advert for quafe 's market-leading range of thirst-quenching beverages !, 
  ( color scheme : light blue + dark grey ),

  tldr ;, 
  * all barges have 3 strip-equivalent yield, 
  * procurer/skiff gets shield hp, 
  * retriever/mack gets + ore bay, 
  * all exhumers still keep +7.5 % resists, 
  * covetor gets +4 % yield , hulk gets +3 % , +3 %, 
  * ore bays are a thing ( up to 37.5 k for a mack ), 
  * mack and skiff bonuses are now rigs, 
  * noob ships now get a flat bonus to all the things , instead of +5 % / level, 
  if you have n't flown a destroyer , you have n't lived . 
  ytterbium 's original dev blog hinted that the ships would get a fair bit tougher . 
  have n't done the numbers to work out what they 're equivalent to now . 
  the workaround for the high slots is probably because : art department :,

  a safe way to invest isk with others ? 
  you 're literally giving someone isk and hoping they 'll, 
  return it, 
  with interest, 
  you can , however , do semi-passive stuff like buying blueprints and researching them for sale , but that attracts the inherent risk that you wo n't be able to sell it once you 're ready . 
  it 's only semi-passive - there are often high ( multi-billion isk ) setup fees , depending on what you 're trying to do . 
  but yeah , i do n't login all that often , but when i do , i kick off ten 8-day manufacturing runs and a half-dozen capital component copying jobs to tide me over . 
  nope , you 'll get the yield bonus but you 'll still have to tank the gas clouds . 
  luckily , the new barges are pretty tough . 
  hardly impossible , but you 'll need to bring a few mates now . 
  t'amber , you do realise you 're talking to a bot ? 
  i suspect the mass bannings of mining bots did more to affect the price of minerals than hulkageddon and the destroyer changes . 
  so gank exhumers instead if you 're so worried about profitability . 
  how comprehensive is the fitting engine ?

   back from vacation and thought this thread could use some dev love . 
   yes , black ops definitely need some attention ; the main problem with them is the lack of role focus . 
  some ( like the redeemer or window ) are trying to achieve a purpose directly on the battlefield , similar with recons by having an electronic warfare or damage related bonus . 
  on top of that , they also are trying to fulfill a fleet support role with their cyno capability , which is quite in contradiction with the previous one . 
   and they are n't great at both : their raw hp is quite lower than tech 1 battleships ( and tech 2 resistance boosts are n't stellar either ) , have less turret and missile hardpoints than tech 1 counterparts and remain more expensive to run , which does n't make them appealing for direct engagement purposes . 
  they also lack autonomy in their support role , as they are quite short ranged , fuel hungry and this issue is amplified by their small fuel bay forcing them to rely on other ships to resupply frequently during an operation . 
   ** the current plan is to take one these two listed roles out of the black ops ship class and reshape them to do the remaining one well . 
  ** if they are disruption ships using ew , they should have more presence on the battlefield for their pricetag . 
  if they are support tools for surprise attacks and small gang movement into enemy space , then they should have the proper bay , range and tools to do so accordingly . 
   ** the role dropped out of the black ops would then be moved to a new class in the tech 2 battleship range to replace for the loss . 
   we acknowledge some entities out there are using black ops with great effect when backed up with the proper organization , structure and out-of-the-box thinking to make use of them in unorthodox situations . 
  while we do n't want to take that away , black ops should be more effective without such heavy commitment into them ( a statistic query we ran at the beginning of this year shown there are more titan than block ops pilot on tq ) . 
  they should be great force multiplier tools for small groups to take on larger ones by surprise , and should be able to do so relatively well without relying on a dedicated support structure . 
   so , when would this be coming out ? 
  unfortunately , not for a while . 
  as explained in the various blogs before , our current priority is to fix tech 1 ships as a whole before moving to more advanced hulls . 
  that is because we need a solid frame of reference to rely on and compare hulls to before we can move to more delicate and complex ships , like black ops or tech 3 hulls .
