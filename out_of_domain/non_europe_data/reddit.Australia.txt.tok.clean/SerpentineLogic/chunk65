  could probably upgrade to full ions with a cheap implant or genolution set . 
  i can make my own t2 rigs , so my cost is ~ 16m . 
  you 'll probably want to downgrade to a fleeting web if you 're worried about cost ( but frankly , you 're flying a 300m isk hull so i figured it was n't a huge issue ), 
  depends on the rig , and the size ( each size smaller than large uses 1/5 of the salvage ), 
  fezzes . 
  always cool . 
  i see a lot of people downvoting you , but this is how it works in dust , so it 's not completely out-there . 
  we 're in truffle now !, 
  probably wo n't last long enough to reload the shield booster if you do . 
  that 's unlikely , considering the amount of damage a ferox can put out . 
  on the plus side , she 's not bankrupt . 
   what would a series of interconnected short stories add up to ? 
  a novel ? 
  a [ season ] ( http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/07/06/announcing-the-human-division/ ) , like a tv series . 
  that sounds ... pretty fair actually . 
  chronic objectivism . 
  caused by reading too much ayn rand . 
  find b0rthole 's minimum skill requirements , then plan to meet them . 
  turns out that having mountains that are literally 93 % pure iron ore is worth some money ... 
  so basically , nothing has changed since the last time these changes were posted . 
  playing an fps against bots seems so un fulfilling now . 
  i go into tear withdrawal . 
  in soviet russia , miners blow a load all over * you * . 
  intaki colour scheme . 
  hnnnnn, 
  who needs rigs anyway . 
  you 're supposed to say `` my bodies are ready '', 
  it happened all the time in world war 2 ... 
  they got authorisation from ccp . 
  you did n't . 
  the maller is always bait . 
  the covetor , not so much . 
  eve only survives because of the fan developed ecosystem . 
  no other mmo would spawn a web site to cover, 
  for the official forums terrible search capabilities . 
  in fact , many of the blaster boats are acceptable-to-excellent with small rails ( usually 75mm ) , because their tracking is pretty decent , and their range is n't wasted ( they hit out to scram range or so ) . 
  the daredevil in particular is quite nasty , since it can keep you almost stationary while it kites you . 
  is that suas ? 
  still , torp golems have range issues that navigation skills can alleviate . 
  and the scout sites are terrible too . 
  first world problems . 
  covetor only requires mining barge i , so no . 
  my friends do n't know i play eve . 
  i just tell them i 'm doing something more socially acceptable , like rereading my ayn rand collection and beating off to pictures of sarah palin . 
  people forget that wolves need there to be lots of sheep around , or it gets pretty lean pickings . 
  same for gankers and victims . 
  dust in stations . 
  til about the intense post theory . 
   i tend to lurk . 
  no wonder you were rejected ; you 'd have a lot of problems with their ` never not post ' doctrine . 
   today is do n't be a dick day, 
  ganking is only unprofitable if you do n't value their tears . 
  while i 'm all for some hull mining of wayward blingus , nothing compares to some 1400mm hatemail . 
  those selected item labels are sexy . 
  you should add them more places , eg tying your targets to wherever they are on your screen . 
  to clarify this - not just in the tutorials . 
  programmers are terrible at documentation . 
  it is known . 
  the guy in charge of the ` corps you may be interested in joining ' thread has started up a subreddit / r/evejobs but it 's still private . 
  and v for t3 production . 
  not so useful for combat pilots , though . 
  no it 's not . 
  90 % of the middle east is dry . 
  in more than one sense of the word . 
  and this is how vajazzling was invented . 
  oh please . 
  as if the nazis would n't have whitewashed their actions if they 'd won . 
  fact is , during wartime there 's a lot of collateral damage , on both sides , perpetrated against their own * and * each other 's population . 
  it 's not ideal , but it 's the way of things , and should be remembered . 
  really ? 
  my reference materials ( \\* ) implied they were called ` britishers ' . 
  \\* ^ ( commando comics ), 
   except for the fact that icelandic men did n't like the interest the icelandic women showed the foreign men . 
  they even [ had a term for it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81standi%c3%b0 ) , translated roughly as ` the condition ', 
  which is fine for the elite pvp gods he will let into the corp , but pretty shit for everyone else . 
  i 'm saying both sides are bad and should feel bad . 
  let your subscription expire , then use the plex 4 hours deal to login and liquidate assets to buy a plex off market . 
  there 's actually [ a few ] ( http://pozniak.pl/wp/?p=4882 ) trading apps on the market place . 
  perhaps one of the other ones will do what you want with less hassle ? 
  i 've seen that video . 
  would not recommend . 
  retirement age is already 67 in a [ couple countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement_age ) . 
  for instance , australia is slowly increasing its retirement age in stages ( if you 're 55 or younger , it is now 67 ), 
  the thing they neglect to mention is that if you 're a recipient for whatever reason , for any amount above $ 1 in one of the many social security programs , cato counts you as a leech , regardless of whether you earned any income by wages that year . 
  tarring everyone who has received welfare with the same brush is just bad statistics . 
  it would be colossally ironic if you buy plex using somer , only to win a nyx with the blink credit . 
  not to be a dick , but private retirement funds are [ how it 's done in australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superannuation_in_australia ) and it 's working pretty well . 
  you can pick and choose which fund ( s ) you contribute to , or self-manage ( subject to stringent anti-fraud measures ) . 
  of course , you do need stringent regulation , but australia learned the lesson of the 1990 recession and has that in place . 
  we still have state-funded unemployment benefits though . 
  send him a message and bug him then :-), 
  tagline : `` we went to the stars to save ourselves , but all we found was spacecocks in local '', 
  it is ; you just have to choose your fights even more carefully . 
  [ hrhfw ] ( http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24095826.jpg ), 
  and yet , the rest of the world somehow manages . 
  if the penalty is hanging or transportation to the colonies , a starving child will still choose to steal a loaf of bread .
