  shh !,

  if i did n't already have a corp freighter to ~ ~ steal ~ ~ borrow , i would have gone for the minmatar freighters . 
  they 're a bit smaller cargo capacity , but they 're * so * much faster to align and/or autopilot . 
  he should have, 
  * told you when to stop ahead of time , just like he should have told you when he would stop, 
  * fit a damage control if there was a possibility of entering structure , or worn the consequences . 
  what 's especially amusing is that ruptures are the heavy support option , 
  manufacturing or bpcs or selling researched bpos ? 
  existing producers will have bottlenecks of specific components . 
  can you meet that demand or are your bpos already fixed ? 
  ar you ok with producing the components in lowsec or will you restrict yourself to high-sec ? 
  does n't matter ; earned millions, 
  ok , then the most-traded capital components are capital construction parts , and it will take ~ 3 months of constant manufacturing profits to pay off the bpo . 
  aside from cap components , lots of capital modules are worth manufacturing , so perhaps that might be good to look at . 
  you guys ca n't collect rainwater ? 
  they 've been cropping up all over my city ; about 16000 extra per year . 
  the point , [ more eloquently put ] ( http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/nsw/long-jail-terms-are-no-deterrent--chief-judge-20120801-23fmw.html ) by a chief justice , is that deterrence only works for some crimes . 
   white collar criminals ... were the exception and '' far more likely to weigh up the risks and benefits of being caught [ and jailed ] '' , ` but it can not be , i suggest , [ a real deterrent ] across the board in the crimes which are impulsive , crimes which come out of the cycle of poverty and abuse and generally ... the less serious crimes .

  if you 're keen , you can set up heat lamps in the middle of each room . 
  when the fleas are ready , they 'll see the heat source , hatch and jump towards it . 
  then you flea bomb again . 
  surfactants break surface tension , so water will not bead into droplets ( e.g. 
  on oily plates ) but will flow into everything , including insect lung-things .

  they 've just used creative accounting . 
  i 'm really not sure his lot are better . 
  more effective ? 
  sure are . 
  they 're making a lot of changes . 
  are the changes the right thing to do ? 
  i 'd argue not , for many of his decisions . 
  as a guy who 's looked at quite a few employment ads over the last couple of years , there has been a huge influx of a specific type of government job . 
  it 's for a 1-year fixed term , with option to extend, 
  the pay is kinda ordinary , considering you can be given the flick ( i.e. 
  permanent staff member wages ), 
  the bligh government instituted these contracts during the gfc because the departments wanted to hire people but it was political suicide to add more staff during austerity . 
  so , the fixed-term contracts , so everyone could pretend they were n't permanent staff . 
  so yes , these contracts * actually were * job cuts in everything but name , just as the positions were permanent jobs in everything but name . 
  the code behind them is like regular gates , stations and wormholes , except it puts you into warp instead of removing you from space . 
  at least one of your characters should learn the skills to anchor mobile large warp disruptor iis . 
  a bubbled gate provides a few crucial seconds for you to get your ships safe . 
  do n't rely on others for their deployment . 
  as a bonus , you 'll then have a character who can double as a pos gunner , which is pretty useful to have on a hauling alt . 
  grind isk , trade it to someone else for a plex ?

  having no legs is a disability that is relatively easy to compensate for , in the grand scheme of things . 
  you logged into the wrong novelty account , morganfreemanismydad . 
  now kiss . 
  still no legs , but you also get, 
  * random sores because you ca n't feel your legs, 
  * needing to take tablets to poo on command , since you ca n't control that any more, 
  * a bag to pee in , or possibly surgery to put a catheter in for the bag, 
  * no sexual function, 
  * random nerve pain in limbs you no longer can move, 
  * the constant spectre of [ dysreflexia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomic_dysreflexia ), 
  * still have to wheel your legs around , which is actually a hassle now . 
  yeah , there certainly is a scale of disabilities , and having no legs is definitely better than most .

  imperial 0rder was a pet alliance bankrolled by a botter . 
  it was n't exactly first rate , but considering that it came out of nowhere based on one guy and a fat wallet , it does show that isk can buy time to grow before someone overturns your anthill . 
  there are entire alliances whose entry requirements you just met .
