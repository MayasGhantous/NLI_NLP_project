  * [ some recent changes to get you up to speed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  see characters , read eve mails , sure . 
  http://gate.eveonline.com as well as the aura for android . 
  actually change skills , no . 
  got ta login ( or use remote desktop ) for that . 
  oh , they 're decent at refining ice , but that 's not enough to justify putting a pos up . 
  tried asking one of the [ evedev ] ( http://wiki.eve-id.net/main_page ) guys ? 
  [ ** recon ships ** ] ( http://www.evealtruist.com/2011/09/know-your-enemy-recon-ships.html ) are the main specialized electronic warfare boats ( there are electronic attack frigates , but they suffer by being , well , fragile frigates ), 
  the gallente boats are specialized long-range tackle , with a side order of sensor dampening . 
  if that does n't appeal , the good news is that adding another racial recon ` only ' requires a different cruiser v and the relevant ewar skills . 
  ** blackbird : ** as a tech 1 cruiser that uses all its mid slots for ecm instead of tank , it 's fragile as hell . 
  nice range and cheap though . 
  the scorpion is a battleship-sized version , which sees use in fleet combat since ship insurance will subsidize most of the losses . 
  ** falcon : ** warps even while cloaked , so great for choosing the right moment to decloak and jam all the things . 
  enough slots for a minimal tank . 
  not so good with jam range though . 
  ** rook : ** better resists , better ( not stellar ) damage output . 
  good in small gangs where you need the dps but generally acknowledged as one of the weakest recons . 
  huginns are * so good * on gate camps . 
  i expect the ore mining frigate will pick up the +2 warp stabs that the skiff lost . 
  generally the huginn will have their own long point , or have a bubble handy ... 
   young americans playing ` eve online ', 
   effecting change for the better good of the american public and your constituents, 
  yes you 'll be fine . 
  the purifier and hound have more low slots for agility modules for pure bombers , but the extra mid slot of the manticore and nemesis are more useful in hot drop scenarios . 
  disonest customers ? 
  even more critically , is this for pvp or pve ? 
  ok , here 's a few fits :, 
  [ thrasher , shield brawler ], 
  damage control ii,

  small energy neutralizer ii, 
  small projectile burst aerator i, 
  small projectile metastasis adjuster i, 
  small core defence field extender i, 
  small neut can be replaced with whatever you want - a small nos might fit with some wiggling . 
  you might like to plug the em resist hole with a rig if you have no friendly ganglinks . 
  [ thrasher , artillery ], 
  tracking enhancer ii, 
  tracking enhancer ii/fourier, 
  limited 1mn microwarpdrive i, 
  stasis webifier ii or balmer tracking disruptor,

  small projectile collision accelerator i, 
  there 's many ways to fit an arty thrasher - this is one optimised more for range and alpha-strike than pure dps . 
  obviously if you 're in a gang situation then you 'll take off tackle and fit a sensor booster or whatever . 
  in that case , you 'll probably need to downgrade most fits to various flavors of tech 1 modules . 
  depends what your role is . 
  if it 's to tear up tier 3 battlecruisers and other frigates , then autocannon fit . 
  if it 's to pop pods and get initial tackle on cloaky stuff like recons and bombers , then artillery fit . 
  alternatively , if you have 11 mates in fleet , all of you go artillery fit . 
  carrier reps wo n't save you from incoming damage , no matter which fit you use . 
  just ask them what they want you to fly , then fly it . 
  i mean , since they 're the ones who are risking their isk and all . 
  get them to fit replacement thrashers in their cargoholds , since you 'll likely lose a ship each time you engage someone . 
  emp , phased plasma and fusion , carry some of each . 
  many people use faction ammo . 
  if you have tech 2 guns , it 's sometimes useful to carry some hail and barrage too . 
  generally the torp bonus is so high that you just use racial tops in all situations . 
  in that case , you do n't switch torps , you switch bombers . 
  oh , so you are against murdering all of them , but letting the feral cats do it for you is ok ? 
  egg-laying breeds make for sub-optimal meat birds . 
  it 's likely that you ca n't break even on a male egg-laying chicken , when you factor in the space and feed you use to grow them to sale weight .

  modulated strip miner ii , veldspar mining crystal ii, 
  medium anti-em screen reinforcer i, 
  medium anti-thermal screen reinforcer i, 
  medium core defense field extender i, 
  11.3 k tank , 30/44/40 / 50 shield resists, 
  10.7 cpu and 15pg free . 
  yield is 21.2 m ^ 3 per second . 
  you can tank it up to about 22k ehp with invulns , dcii and bulkheads , but your yield drops to 16.4 m ^ 3 per second . 
  ofc if you 're going to drop your yield down that far , you may as well use a procurer . 
  even fit for yield , it outmines a tanky retriever .
