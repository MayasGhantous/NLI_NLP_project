  57.7 k ehp , 69/58/69 / 74.1 shield resists . 
  6.72 cpu and 16 grid free, 
  yield is still a respectable 19.5 m ^ 3 per second . 
  ofc you can tank it up to 75k ehp using a pds ii , but then youre back to 16.4 m ^ 3 yield . 
  i think you 'll find that once you fit a damage control , you 're better off with reinforced bulkheads than eanms . 
  yes . 
  this eve video came out after the fall of band of brothers by just this scenario .

  as long as you provide a way for users to nuke their data without needing to accept any new t & c. . . 
  or a wizard, 
  tbh , while 8 % is nothing to be sniffed at , you will probably be growing your userbase faster than that just on feature set . 
  racial torps , not racial bombs . 
  i 'm not sure you understand how multiplication * works * . 
  retriever is about 30 minutes to fill up . 
  oversupply of isogen , probably from the rampant reprocessing of pax amarrias a few months back . 
  the pax amarria used to reprocess into 6 nocx and 2 isogen . 
  just like when they tried to put the rabbit-proof firewall in . 
  i suspect there 's a bit of indoctrination going on in singapore . 
  i mean , they ca n't even * pretend * to have an opposing political party ... 
  that probably explains why practically every malysian i know is malaysian chinese . 
  accept that some people will lie to you in order to feel better about past events . 
  just for you , i added a couple more links to recent epic tales of economic debauchery . 
  it will be difficult enough just getting fleet members to pay attention to the wing-leader 's target broadcasts instead of the fcs ... 
  makes sense . 
  if they 're so easily swayed , they 'll be in tears by the end of the first day on the job . 
  the ipo thing is n't new ; there were rumours [ since february ] ( http://tagn.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/ccp-makes-66-million-in-2011-talks-ipo-and-hires-david-reid/ ) at least , but i did n't know they were serious about pushing for it . 
  i would dock in station then undock and see whether it fixes itself . 
  for extra irony , botters can use rmt earnings to buy shares in ccp . 
  a retriever fit for yield has \\* checks notes \\* 11.3 k tank and will last ~ 22 minutes before its hold is filled up . 
  a procurer fit for yield has 53k tank and will last 12 minutes . 
  choose your poison . 
  well , you could just mine slower . 
  if a retriever has a damage control , it isnt fit for yield . 
  try agony empire . 
  the way i figure , if youve just cut their houses power cable to get that titan kill , why not finish the job amirite ?

  you 're ready to go into low-sec when you 've accepted that the ship you 're flying is not ** you ** , and losing it is n't the end of the world . 
  for some , it 's an economic decision . 
  i first went into lowsec after a month or two , because i was bored of the mission grind and the lowsec rats and exploration sites were way more lucrative than high sec . 
  an intact armor plate goes a long way towards the personal vexor replacement fund . 
  i found that low sec generally is less populated than you think . 
  i did lose a few ships , but i had a lot of memorable experiences too ( `` oh , so that 's what a cyno looks lik - ohshit carriers '' , `` crap i 'm being pointed by a curse oh wait i 'm in a shield myrm nbd '' ), 
  for others , it 's the challenge of pitting your skills and will against other players . 
  they are the sort of players who join red vs blue for the pvp experience , but find it ultimately unrewarding for one reason or another . 
  lowsec piracy is a lot harder to find fights in and way more risky for both sides . 
  the thrill of the hunt is real outside highsec . 
  you sound like you 're in the second camp . 
  i suggest you put together a dozen t1 frigates and/or destroyers of your chosen race , then join red vs blue and pvp until they 're gone . 
  then reassess whether you want the constant skirmishes that rvb offers , or whether you want something a bit more meaty . 
  if so , i suggest enlisting in faction warfare , where you still get the guaranteed enemies and guaranteed allies , but you can also make some serious bank . 
  as a non-american , it 's way better without cheese . 
  seriously , american cheese is some really weird stuff . 
  tldr ; systems change hands when people run complexes in enemy systems , then drop capital ships on the now-vulnerable infrastructure hub and put up their own .

  i have found that four hobgoblin i will be enough even in 0.5 space , now that retrievers are much more buffed . 
  just add a shield resistance rig for the two main damage types that the local rats do and you should be fine . 
  anecdotal evidence suggests that if your belt is worth 80m initially , it will get +20 m bigger each day until it hits 160m or so . 
  no , much the opposite . 
  in fps games , i 'm p chill , although i do get a bit annoyed when my team gets steamrolled repeatedly . 
  in eve , every kill or loss makes me `` fuck yeah '' or `` welp '' like the memiest of internet memes . 
  define good . 
  which one was it , if you do n't mind ? 
  you can message me instead if you prefer . 
  then again , we now know your character name too . 
  because i looked up the current and past members of his corp ? 
  eve has few rules about exploding other players ' ships , but the big one is, 
  ** do n't gank in the noob systems **, 
  raise a petition and i guarantee that those players will be getting 2-week bans . 
  the corp finder employs secret algorithms known only to the insane and those who have read forbidden grimoires and have been forever tainted by their unspeakable prose . 
  and seo marketers . 
  this means that a corp that does everything and thus clicks all the buttons of ` what does this corp do ' may rank low on the relevance scale , but will then gain relevance when you narrow to a specific time zone and click ` hardcore ' vs ` casual ' etc. 
  this makes it less than ideal , because for most people , hardcore vs casual is less important than what the corp actually * does * . 
  ** tldr ; ** corp search is hit and miss . 
  narrowing your advert makes it more highly placed , but in a weird way . 
  people rage in dota because they ca n't grief back . 
  in eve , if someone pisses you off , you 're allowed to track them down and fuck * their * shit up . 
  this is quite a stress-reliever . 
  i do n't mind mining . 
  at least i 'm undocked and earning isk while i organise my industry spreadsheets ... 
  i believe the term originated as ` gang-kill ' or something similar , back when everquest 1 was new . 
  it has evolved slightly since then , and now it means any combat situation where one side demonstrates overwhelming firepower , usually on a defenceless or unprepared target . 
  assuming me100 , pe1 , you 're looking at ~ 6.7 m profit per day , if you manage to sell every component you make . 
  isboxer , i assume ? 
  this is a ... not terrible idea . 
   here 's a free idea : an igb page which reports a player 's current system to the intel site . 
  you mean like a [ dotlan radar ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/radar ) tracking code ? 
  well , you can gank non-noobs in a noob system ( i occasionally see hulk pilots casually hoovering up the place ) , but killing noobs is asking for a banhammer . 
  the finest reddit tradition . 
  how convenient that dotlan has themes so you can be as [ dark and edgy ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/theme/dark ) as you want . 
  the way i figure it , there should be a mix of vanity items , and useful stuff that is thematically appropriate for concord to offer .
