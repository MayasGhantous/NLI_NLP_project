  * concord ship and cargo scanners ( the obvious inclusion ), 
  * accept concord lp + pirate tags to improve negative sec status, 
  * concord police uniforms for * that kind * of roleplay, 
  * faction ammunition ( about as good as guristas ) . 
  it does n't have to be as good as faction ammo , just a way to stop stuff like guristas antimatter s being more expensive than cnam s, 
  * etc, 
  it 's twilight fanfic with some search and replace done to it . 
  that 's all that needs to be said . 
  irony level : reddit, 
   i 'm confused about the ammo thing . 
  let me illustrate the discrepancy between increasing power and cost :, 
  charge therm kinetic price, 
  antimatter charge s 7.0 5.0 33.36, 
  guristas antimatter charge s 7.7 5.5 1,999.99, 
  caldari navy antimatter charge s 8.05 5.75 465.12, 
  dread guristas antimatter charge s 8.4 6.0 94,996.99, 
  wash cars , receive dollars ? 
  yeah but do they have flashy police lights ? 
  one would imagine by forcing the price of equivalent-power pirate ammo down , but perhaps i 'm attributing too much rationality to the market .

  there are even [ eve cocktails ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/v7d51/eve_drinkscocktails/ ) . 
  do n't forget to tell everyone to kill themselves . 
  before you reprocess them into minerals , you might like to check how much is refinable , and how much is ` extra materials ' and thus ineligible for reprocessing . 
  you can , however , hold onto them and sell them at a profit , provided mineral prices do n't fall .

  he was pretty creepy in one hour photo . 
  i know people with  1000 barges of various flavors , and i 'm sure there are many others . 
  i think it will take * a while * to chew through those stockpiles . 
  case [ nightmare green ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thelaundryseries ) is in effect . 
  that 's racist !, 
  having sex , of course . 
  op is correct . 
  there are some parts of dna that do n't get mixed during conception . 
  for instance , the y chromosome only exists in males , so it goes straight from father to son . 
  similarly , all mitochondriae come from the mother 's side , since sperm do n't deposit the man 's mitochondria into the egg . 
  the key difference is that every child who has a y chromosome will pass that onto their sons , so if there 's something wrong with it , that gene lineage will suffer . 
  for mitochondrial dna , anything that is flat-out bad will affect both sons and daughters , and affect the daughter 's children ( but not the son 's , since he does n't pass it on because he 's male ) . 
  hower , anything that 's ok for daughters but bad for sons ** wo n't be selected against ** , since those sons wo n't be passing that dna anyway . 
  the son may die at 40 , but his kids will be getting their mitochondrial dna from his wife , not him , so it 's a dead-end . 
  ** tldr ; ** mitochondria does n't care about males because only women will pass them onto the next generation, 
  if a mitochondrial mutation occurs in a man , generally it wo n't get passed to his progeny . 
  if a mutation occurs in a woman , then it will get passed to all her progeny , but only her daughters will pass it on further . 
  from their mothers . 
  i believe the traditional form of payment is ~ ~ boobs ~ ~ arts & crafts projects . 
  that 's right . 
  so , if a mutation only affects men , the men will have a bad time , but the women will be unaffected and happily have kids and pass it on anyway . 
  a retriever fit for yield will pull in 21.2 m ^ 3 of ore , or 12.06 m ^ 3 of ice per second . 
  that translates to, 
  * 4054 isk/second mining veldspar ( + whatever drones get ), 
  * 3909 isk/second mining smooth glacial mass, 
  assuming my ore calculations are correct , yes ( the yield calculations certainly are ), 
  that 's not bad for a non-combat afk ship , although scordite is probably better to mine than veld atm . 
  that 's just asking for an internet meme to be made from it . 
  as a client-configurable thing , i figure if i have n't clicked/moved the mouse or pressed a button in ten minutes , i 'm functionally afk . 
  plex prices change for two reasons :, 
  * players who need quick cash depress the market ; an influx of returning veterans will make it spike . 
  plex prices have traditionally increased over time anyway , as more players find ways to get enough isk to buy them each month ( w-space , incursions and now faction war farming ), 
  * major market barons like to manipulate plex prices because there 's a high trade volume but also high price per unit . 
  of course , there 's a limit that this can be pushed because new supply is as close as your credit card , but if you stay cautious , even a relatively small spike can make you a lot of isk . 
  i suggested this to him a few days ago . 
  raath delivers . 
  from [ his blog ] ( http://drkindustry.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/copy-and-pasting-space-is-all-about-spreadsheets-these-days/ ) :, 
   as it turns out nearly everything in eve online can be ctrl + a ctrl + c ed . 
  directional scans , mineral scan results even inventory can be copied to clipboard . 
  so i had to take advantage of this feature and hopefully make a few lives easier . 
   [ r ] ecently someone asked me if they could copy the contents of the mineral scanner somehow . 
  the logic was that if they warped an orca right into belt , do a scan then copy paste the results into some widget and get an overall value of the belt . 
   [ ... ] i 've added the feature to the public end as well so people not registered can use the [ price check ] ( http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com/fuel ) feature by checking the `` show refined worth '' checkbox . 
   so now everyone has an easy to use lookup widget to get the current refined value of their current stock or that gravi belt they just discovered without all the hassle of having to enter values in one at a time . 
  i bet even chribba would find this feature handy for his veld fleet , 
  also : always have a mining fleet up , and encourage corpmates to make one if they login before you do . 
  you only have to fleet warp everyone away from an impending suicide gank once to be a hero for life . 
  extra points if the ganker was actually you on a throwaway character . ), 
  mining is not your job . 
  making mining enjoyable for your corpmates is . 
  that means you organise, 
  * correct fits, 
  * availability of crystals and replacement ships ( either corp hangar or on market ), 
  * regular mining ops into corp calendar/forums/jabber / eve voice/smoke signals, 
  * posting pics from bonjourmadame in fleet chat to keep miners ~ ~ f ~ ~ happy, 
  * payouts from previous ops, 
  * perfect refining, 
  * selling the minerals, 
  * monitoring the safety of the surrounding systems for gankers, 
  * ensuring that belts are n't over-mined , and if so , scouting other systems to find the biggest roids, 
  * posting regular updates to corp about how awesome mining ops are and they should totally get into it .
