  expanded cargoholds too , if you like . 
  eventually , get into a retriever , and read haladas mining guide . 
   defiantly, 
  [ definitely ] ( http://www.d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y.com/ ), 
  do i have to link that site again ? 
  i think the correct term is, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  6nj in venal according to my intel . 
  hits like a battleship , flies ( and tanks ) like a cruiser . 
  this is proving useful . 
  shuttles in lowsec ( carpet bomb every station in a pocket ) . 
  who cares if they 're 50k isk instead of 12k if it saves you from flying your pod around . 
  challenge accepted, 
  theres always , incursions . 
  pve in a pickup fleet . 
  that happens now . 
  most links give 2 % bonus , which means the t2 link gave 2.5 %, 
  however , the t2 links gave the wrong bonus if the t1 link gave a different bonus amount , so this fix will scale them appropriately . 
  probably not , because the entire internet would know he 's an easy mark . 
  how do you detect and avoid something that moves at the speed of light ? 
  yulai local , you mean ? 
  are you nuts ? 
  a bhaal can cap out three guardians at the same time . 
  heck , its close to being able to cap them out in one cycle . 
  if only you were a math major, 
  i run mine in windowed mode so i can read reddit while gate camping . 
  did some level 1 missions , went f this and started ratting in lowsec domain in my shield tanked myrm . 
  i got tackled by a curse the next day ( they couldnt break my tank ) , and after experiencing the massive adrenaline rush of high-stakes pvp , i was hooked . 
  six shield power relays necessitate passive hardeners anyway , so my tank was 100 % effective regardless of neuting . 
  passive shield tanked myrmidons are an unusual choice to fight sansha rats with . 
  what can i say - i was new to the game . 
  or just come up with an alternative . 
  a squid proxy , so to speak . 
  and also shouting `` let me out of this coffin !, 
  my local chinese restaurant serves goat hot pot . 
  its a traditional , and delicious , dish . 
  to the english-speakers he calls it lamb . 
  i suppose he can chalk it up to a translation issue if need be . 
  when i was a kid , i used to bait my dads stud goat just so he would run after me and smack his testicles on clods of earth since they hung so low . 
  i 'm not sure what that says about me ... 
  many sheep farms in new zealand have about 1 % goats because unlike sheep , goats are intelligent enough to learn stuff , like ` car horn beeping means food ' , ` dog means run away from it ' and ` rain means find shelter ' . 
  the goats on our farm when i was growing up had ten-foot-high fences . 
  they certainly jumped straight over fences that would keep cattle in . 
  i 'd run a tackle rapier , even a tackle stealth bomber , but probably not a tackle falcon . 
  its mid slots are too precious for such mundane pursuits . 
  generally , a falcon runs with a fit substantially similar to this :, 
  ** low **, 
  * 1600mm plate, 
  * 2 signal distortion amplifiers, 
  * * no damage control because falcons do n't really have enough structure to matter *, 
  * sensor booster if you suspect there will be enemy falcons you need to jam first, 
  * lots of meta-4 ecm ( fit for enemy gang composition , try to avoid multispecs due to low range ), 
  ** high **, 
  * probe launcher if you want . 
  cyno if you want . 
  * whatever guns that fit ( probably small blasters ), 
  * t2 jam strength rig ( otherwise stacking penalty kicks in ), 
  * t1 ecm optimal range rig, 
  * nanite repair paste because you 'll be overheating those ecm like a boss . 
  i was about to downvote you for racial slur , then i looked at his username . 
  truth is a valid libel defence . 
  carry on . 
  scorch is for pulses , and will be difficult to push out to 150km . 
  you 're probably better off fitting tachyons to your oracle instead . 
  good luck attempting to load your tachyon * beam * laser with * pulse * laser crystals ~, 
  falcons used to have the absurd range bonus that the tech 1 version , the blackbird still has . 
  imagine the frustration of fighting a ship that jams the hell out of you from 130km away , then cloaks up and warps ( cloaked ) when you get anywhere remotely near it . 
  just make sure you check in regularly with friends in case you start spiralling out . 
  a relative of mine is a poet , and when he 's on his meds , his poetry is , frankly , terrible . 
  when he 's * off * them , his peotry is quite impressive , but his life as a functioning human being destabilizes eventually . 
  a few reasons . 
  * blackbirds ca n't fit a decent tank , and ca n't even withstand frigates for very long, 
  * falcons have more slots for fitting stuff, 
  * falcons have no range bonus , but they have a * massive * ecm strength bonus, 
  * ** falcons warp cloaked ** , so they do n't scare off the prey, 
  if you are ok with losing the covert ops cloak in return for that range bonus , then the rook is a credible tech 2 upgrade to the blackbird . 
  sometimes , unborn children need to be operated on . 
   once you leave the amniotic sac there is no going back, 
  not according to this iama i read once . 
  this is a fairly decent fit to aim for , btw . 
  i should n't need to , but [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/nmmjr/iama_man_who_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_his/ ), 
  i heard about an obstetrician that saved the foreskins left over from circumcisions and sewed them into a wallet . 
  unfortunately , every time he put money in , it turned into a handbag . 
   damage control also gives you shield and armor resists too, 
  but nowhere near enough extra ehp to justify the loss of a signal distortion amp for ecm , i.e. 
  the raison d'etre for flying a falcon in the first place . 
   i 'd go with a single lse for tank instead of the plate . 
  sensible in shield fleets , but remember that you 've given up ~ 16 % of your jamming for only half the ehp boost that a 1600mm plate will give . 
  oh , and your jam rigs reduce your shield hp too . 
  what we 're saying is that the best way to improve combat effectiveness will be to get a t2 or t3 * ship * rather than load up on expensive modules . 
  you 're confusing game time with plex . 
  if you only want raw game time , then it 's probably cheapest to pick up a subscription from the eve-o site . 
  ( if you 're in the eurozone then depending on exchange rate , buying a 60-day time code in us currency might be cheaper ), 
  the appeal of using time cards is that they can be split into plex that can be redeemed for 30 days playing time at your discretion ( meaning you wo n't waste money if you decide to stop playing for a few months during a subscription ) and you can sell them in-game for valuable currency . 
  no freighter is safe ~, 
  then a gank typhoon fleet issue will be a fine stand-in for a battlecruiser when you want to pew . 
  t2 : skill intensive , specialized ships that take a while to train, 
  navy and pirate ships : almost as good as t2 , easier to get into , but more expensive . 
  head injuries do strange things . 
  depends on the type of indy character .
