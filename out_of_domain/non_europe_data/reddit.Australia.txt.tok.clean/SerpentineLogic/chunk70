  getting the gift card at 15 % instead of 49 % is a serious difference to your wallet . 
  so , just like real life . 
  they 're one of the very few groups that rote kapelle has set blue standings to . 
  feel free to message me about research slots . 
  i would prefer to see the entire article in the rss feed instead of just the summary . 
  fringe benefits tax always applies at the highest tax level , regardless of your ordinary tax rate . 
  thank fuck i do n't have to go to kugu to find them any more . 
  faction police : yes, 
  concord : nope . 
  they [ do n't take damage ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/plotarmor ) the same way other ships do . 
  duct tape featured heavily in mad max . 
  or maybe it was the bondage movie that was on right afterwards . 
  well both factions can use missiles and favor shield tanking so that skill training wo n't be wasted . 
  personally , i 'd get caldari cruiser iii to get into a drake , then see whether it 's worth training caldari further . 
  tm.com is definitely biased , but it 's the subtle sort that is easily missed . 
  that 's one reason i read it ; to practice reading between the lines and seeing what is left unsaid . 
  not to be a spoilsport , but you might want to check the shield recharge time on the dni vs a regular domi . 
  you might be surprised ( and dismayed ) . 
  i think active tanking it would be best . 
  even the tech 1 barges are [ pretty decent ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ) for their cost . 
  generally , contract work is offered at about 40 % more than they 'd pay a permanent staff member over the same time period . 
  not paid for sick days, 
  no annual leave, 
  not paid for public holidays, 
  must pay their own superannuation ( 9 % ), 
  they take on the risk of not having permanent employment, 
  you get to fire them at the end of the contract without recourse ( this is worth real money to an employer ), 
  sounds like you will work for them as a permanent employee and they will just split your rate so you get 91 % in your bank account ant 9 % in your super account . 
  or roll with a rattlesnake . 
  since it 's a jita alt , i imagine it would be caldari navy . 
  i 've contracted through recruitment agencies for the last few years and my gross income is consistently 40 % more than i could expect as a permanent staff member doing the same job , even with the recruitment company taking its ~ 25 % share . 
  perhaps you just have greedy recruiters ? 
  i could do with some spacelane patrol standings myself . 
  i 'm no fitting expert , but something like this would not be completely terrible :, 
  passive tanked to sustained 692dps , deals 276 +692 = 968dps ( 151 +692 if you use cruises ),

  yes . 
  the fleet boosts still matter , and it 's good to fly one in and use a survey scanner to [ work out the net worth ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/yi7sl/scan_shipcargobelt_paste_into_here_get_total_price/ ) of the entire belt . 
  well , if you use [ planetary manufacturing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) rather than extraction , then you do n't need it . 
  dariusiii and his groupies did it quite a lot . 
  if you want to grief , probably easier these days to just kill the mothership asap in all highsec incursions .

  ** q : ** how do you make a small fortune with market manipulation ? 
  ** a : ** start with a large fortune . 
  google for the full disclosure or greedy goblin blogs , and start from the beginning . 
  i recommend starting another character for combat , actually . 
  combat characters are mobile ; industry characters are n't really . 
  first up , to answer your questions :, 
  ** deep core mining **, 
  requires modulated deep core miner for mining mercoxit in nullsec . 
  it 's pretty niche , and mercoxit is only available in a few spots . 
  generally done in procurers or retrievers in gravimetric sites scanned down by explorers . 
  belt mining in lowsec is a futile endeavour . 
  you either get killed , or you spend all your time warping out instead of mining . 
  if you 're going to go for high-risk mining , you 're better off going into a wormhole and mining the true high-ends rather than trifling with mid-range ores in lowsec . 
  ** what to fly **, 
  you 're a month old with imperfect skills . 
  flying a mack or hulk anywhere is financial suicide . 
  read a [ guide to the t1 mining barges ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ) and choose a role that works for you . 
  you are n't sacrificing much yield , but you 're saving yourself a lot of isk you can use on skillbooks and replacement ships . 
  ** what to mine **, 
  at your noobish level of boundless enthusiasm , that will be ore . a [ helpful web site ] ( http://ore.cerlestes.de/index.html#site:ore ) tells you that scordite is currently the best ore you have available in high-sec . 
  once you get a second account , you can switch to the less-attention-required ice harvesting , where you can happily do stuff with your combat character , and switch windows and haul your retriever back to station every 30 minutes or so . 
  this minimises the boredom of mining , while still bringing in the income . 
  i 'm stuck on wing command iii because i loved that game back in the day . 
  some big-name actors did the cut scenes , including malcolm mcdowell and john rhys-davies . 
  oh and mark hamill was in it too . 
  tbh anything with 3d graphics runs fairly hot on a macbook . 
  i use smcfancontrol to bump the fan speed before i start up tf2 or eve ... 
  the cynic in my says that when he tires of mining , it 's a short skill train to get the skills to fly an orca with that character . 
  you forgot the items and isk required to cash in the lp . 
  it 's actually closer to 1000 isk/lp when you look at the buy orders , but it 's [ probably the best ] ( http://www.evemarketeer.com/trade/bestloyaltypoints?faction=-1&amp;corporation=1000080 ) you 're going to get from that corp. 
  yeah fozzie is doing a great job . 
  buy him a beer for us . 
   22 hardeners, 
  oh , so * that 's * why they 're called dick stars . 
  just buff deep space transports and you 're done . 
  tbh , the ` hangar divisions ' thing is antiquated . 
  the actual * use cases * i 've seen are more like what is called ` tagging ' in gmail etc. 
  having said that , i 'd need much fewer hangar divisions if we could use corp bpos from our personal hangars ( and had personal hangars at poses ), 
  a way for alliances to secretly steal resources from nearby neighbours would help fragment the bonds of trust between coalition members , 
  which you could do with tags,
