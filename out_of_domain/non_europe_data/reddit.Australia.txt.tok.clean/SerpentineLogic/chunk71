  thoughtworks is one of the better consultancies to work for . 
  a few friends of mine started out at accenture and ibm and it was less than ideal for them . 
  you must be new here ( to life ) . 
  personally , i 'd do the sisters of eve epic mission arc , that starts in arnon . 
  it 's a good way to tour a few regions in highsec , picking up decent isk and eventually making friends with an empire faction and gaining some standings with them . 
  start a boosted mining fleet in highsec , charge people for blue standings so they can get the boosts by joining . 
  sounds like an opportunity to extend the power curve of your budding career way beyond where most people plateau . 
  i take it you 're cramming the fowler signature series ? 
  sorting by ` best ' is [ better ] ( http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html ) than ` hot ' , as well as being xkcd-approved . 
  oh , i thought you already knew who fozzie is , and were being sarcastic . 
  hint : his player character actually is/was fairly well-known and liked . 
  he still posts up a storm on failheap whenever someone mentions solo pvp . 
   for a new player who 's still dirt poor , i 've already reached the point where i 'm grinding up/discarding anything under 100k just so i do n't develop carpal tunnel selling off one thing at a time from a loot bag of several hundred items . 
  just reprocess them into minerals then . 
  the eve client is python . 
  the eve server is in c and stackless python . 
  the web site is coded in asp ( poorly ), 
  i really could n't say ( not verone though ), 
  that , and brackets . 
  cargo holds are cheap . 
  speaking as a colonial , we regard the queen as basically a mascot or gossip source , like you guys have kim kardashian . 
  welcome to 2003 ? 
  it is known . 
  and if you were ever allowed to convert that isk into real life money , you would own serious inner-city apartment blocks , 
  the usa will change its money right after it goes metric . 
  tbh , you * should * be able to do everything via evegate that you can do in eve , except undock .

  that 's quite a * polite * term for what he posts .

  when you buy a gtc from him :, 
  you receive between 125m and 200m isk blink credit,

  take that whichever way you want . 
  or just pay in advance , in small increments . 
  many ships have 20 % more kinetic resist than their resist hole . 
  a lot fewer have 25 % though . 
  weeeeeeell , he does have a point hidden in there . 
  ** fact : ** dayz is more accessible than eve , even though they are both sandbox games . 
  ** fact : ** dayz is accessible * in part * because fps controls are well-known . 
  ** fact : ** eve * could * be more accessible the same way if piloting your ship was more like x-wing , since heaps of people know how to use a joystick . 
  ** massive speculation : ** the * rest * of the reason is because eve is not hard enough . 
  it would be * glorious * . 
  labor would say `` be thankful you 're not poor enough to need help '' . 
  liberals would say `` consider it encouragement to earn more '' . 
  i agree . 
  death in dayz , for all its brutality , is still more like changing maps in cs : go and losing all your cash , than diablo on hardcore mode , where you lose everything . 
  as i said in the comments in the op , dayz is easy-come , easy-go . 
  i encourage you to do this . 
  ask freight club . 
  they know what to do to freighters .

  depends on the wormhole class . 
  a low or mid-class wormhole may result in roams into lowsec or null , but the higher classes usually end up roaming into other holes instead . 
  not very . 
  just accept that sometimes , you wo n't be going on that roam .
