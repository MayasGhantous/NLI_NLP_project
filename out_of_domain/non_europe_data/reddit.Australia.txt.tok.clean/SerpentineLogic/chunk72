  51 days would get you a t1 manufacturer character . 
  your target is 100k/hour/assembly line profit ( e.g. 
  making bulk small drones or something similar ) , which if you can keep it up , will bring in 700m/month . 
  so yeah , it 's doable . 
  a good rule of thumb is not to fly any ship you ca n't replace twice with your current wallet balance . 
  i have [ one of these ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=1217 ) [ . 
  ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/graphics/icons/64/icon21_08.png ) they 're great to put into your cargo hold for amusing lossmails . 
  are you serious , or was that a throwaway comment ? 
  tbh in most cases it 's better to go with a procurer in nullsec if you 're solo . 
  * it aligns faster, 
  * it 's cheaper, 
  * you ca n't afk anyway because : reds : so the main advantage of a retriever is under-utilized . 
  * even with max yield fit , it still tanks a fair bit , so if you get tackled by a solo ship , you have a minute or two to arrange for your fleetmates to come save you , or chase off the tackler , or enact revenge . 
  this also helps with rats . 
  something like [ this fit ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/procurer_yield.png ) might be a good start . 
  implants , too, 
  upvoting everything from that blog because awesome . 
  about 90 % of the recruitment apps i see are obvious spies , which makes it easy for me to reject them . 
  the rest are subtle spies , which i can live with . 
  tbh all someone needs to do is put the package they received on dropbox or something . 
  it might not be exactly what people want , but it 's a lot better than nothing . 
  with +15 % damage per level of covert ops , your target will have to be * extremely * vulnerable to another damage type to be worth switching from your racial torp . 
  that was fifty years ago . 
  who nose these days ? 
  dna is information too , you know . 
  honestly , industrial corps have the most to lose by spies . 
  * blueprints are expensive, 
  * anyone who can lodge a corporate industry job can cancel anyone else 's jobs , with no logging, 
  * mining ships are great to awox because they ca n't shoot back, 
  * industrial corps actually use all their hangars for stuff . 
  tank on a retriever : 11k , maybe 18k if you sacrifice yield for tank, 
  tank on a procurer : 50k fit for yield , or 75k when tanked . 
   also , again , retriever can use a full flight of dishonor drones , it 's really the only chance a mining barge has to escape if tackled . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  the procurer has a 25 m ^ 3 drone bay , same as the retriever . 
  courtesy of sarmatiko , whose database dumps have predicted, 
  * all the crucible modules, 
  * all the inferno modules, 
  * practically every upcoming balance change since incarna, 
  organising bombing runs against ideal targets is the * reason for existence * of entire corporations ... 
  they tried that and the player population said it does n't work very well . 
  they might revisit it when they get to larger ships ( e.g. 
  the apoc ), 
  for extra easy-mode , a faction lsb can be made cap-stable on a 5-launcher variant . 
  that should give you an easy 2000dps gurista tank . 
  it 's lowsec , so there 's no bubbles . 
  1 . undock then stop your ship . 
  if there 's someone camping the station , dock up . 
  if there is n't , click ` jump ' on the gate to highsec . 
   what 's a bubble ? 
  [ these things ] ( http://k162space.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/2009-12-22-21-43-43.jpg ) . 
  [ [ more info ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/warp_disruption_fields ) ], 
  i see rote kapelle guys roaming in small hyperion gangs . 
  then again , it 's rote kapelle . 
  they 'll fly anything crazy , just to get fights . 
  ^ & nbsp ; ^ & nbsp ;[ ... call & nbsp ; me ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/warcraft#banshee ), 
  tbh i name all my ships ` x ' . 
  well , now you know to learn ahead of time which stations have, 
  * repair facilities , and, 
  * medical facilities, 
  there 's a few ways it could go . 
  manufacturing times is a good bet , since longer manufacturing times directly impact profitability , as well as tie up assembly lines for longer , which is a neat double-whammy ( actually , triple-whammy if you also increase manufacturing fees per hour ), 
  another option is to look at standings affecting jobs . 
  at present , corp standings affect the set-up cost of manufacturing jobs , but since the set-up cost is stupid small , nobody wants to grind standings to save 186.66 isk . 
  and the other thing would be to reduce the refining efficiency in high-sec ( and boost it in low-sec ) . 
  while this makes great sense initially ( environmental laws in lowsec ? 
  ) , it may adversely affect noob miners , because the experienced highsec miners all have maxed veldspar processing skills anyway , so they 'll get perfect refines already . 
  however , there might be wiggle room for impacting the percentage of refined minerals that corps take for low standings . 
  at present it 's 5 % -  0 % with 6.66 standings . 
  yeah incarna was n't their fault , but they still got sacked . 
  game programming is the porn industry for geeks . 
  ** step 1 : ** all of you join faction warfare on the same side . 
  [ here 's one i prepared earlier ] ( / r/fweddit ) . 
  ** step 2 : ** orbit complexes in the same system , get some income from loyalty points to replace any losses, 
  ** step 3 : ** get bored after an hour of that and go looking for fights in a frigate/destroyer wolfpack, 
  looks like aura for android [ ca n't pull anything useful ] ( https://plus.google.com/112994369116580999041/posts/9wdqq5du3be ) from the api either . 
  * if only * you had free will and could change what you do ... 
  most of * them * got fired or had executive control wrested away from them . 
  i think the incarna project was a good idea in principle , but it needed a * lot * more oversight than it did . 
  i 've lived in syndicate . 
  it 's great for pitting your skills against the best small gang pvp experts in the eve cluster ( and usually coming out second best ), 
  not so good for three guys learning how to pew . 
  so , what youre saying is that [ these are your endgames . 
  use them ? 
  evidently nosferatus siphon gas from your gas tank . 
  what are your rates ? 
  do n't forget the remap changes . 
  those were pretty neat . 
  not all of us have blues , though . 
  i would be ok with command processors being removed , or only able to be fit to command ships . 
  that would fix a lot of issues immediately . 
  eve-o forums allow private corp forums once you hit ten players , which is all you need when you 're starting out . 
  get everyone on voice comms . 
  if you are starting out , just voice-enable a channel so you can use eve voice . 
  it 's not awesome like mumble , but it 's a lot better than nothing . 
  streamline your corp recruitment . 
  have a canned evemail you can send saying, 
  * `` thanks for your interest in noobcorp .
