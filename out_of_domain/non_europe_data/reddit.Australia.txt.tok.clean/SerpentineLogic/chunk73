  collect a lot of [ newbie guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ) and post them on the forum . 
  you need to streamline the induction process for recruits , which , besides the obvious [ combat guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ) , includes corp-specific stuff such as, 
  where your offices are , and what they 're for, 
  which corps you 're missioning in , and where the best level 1/2/3 / 4 agents are, 
  recommended ships for those missions, 
  what 's available in the corp hangar ( s ) , and not to bogart the corp noctis, 
  what other services the corp provides, 
  have a plan , and communicate it to the entire corp in regular ( i.e. 
  monthly at least ) updates . 
  * `` hi , we 've made goal # 2 ( corp taxes have paid for a large caldari tower ) . 
  next goal is to afford all the defenses ( mostly ecm modules ) . 
  once we have that , we 'll start on a fuel stockpile . 
  remember , friday nights are when we stop missioning and go wormhole diving to familiarise ourselves with pvp in w-space , so look for active fleets and join up in a cheap ship . 
  ceo out . 
   this come once in a while . 
  as some people mentioned before :, 
   * tier 2 battlecruisers already are extremely versatile and popular . 
  introducing yet improved hulls based on them without looking at tech1 battlecruisers first is in direct contradiction with the tiericide initiative . 
   * we already have troubles having diverse , interesting hulls roles on this particular level . 
  hacs , tech3 cruisers , battlecruisers and command ships currently are very close of each other on that field . 
  introducing a navy battlecruiser would aggravate the issue even further . 
   what needs to be done before having navy battlecruisers , in no particular order :, 
   * have a look at tech1 cruisers and bring tiericide to their sorry little sad faces . 
   * fix tech1 battlecruisers as a whole . 
  most tier1 bcs are not good enough , some tier2 are just too good . 
  you know we know you know which ones we are talking about : twisted :, 
   * make sure command ships have a viable role next to battlecruisers ( nighthawk versus drake for example ) . 
  look at gang links . 
   * hacs , they need love too . 
   * tech3 ships need to be put down , like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house , they are out of line . 
  it does n't necessarily means nerfing them to oblivion and beyond , but making sure that each subsystem configuration has a use and they do n't overlap on other ships by making them different in role and purpose . 
   ** when that 's done ** , and if the need for it is true , righteous in the divine gospel of the ship balancing light , then let 's have navy battlecruisers , maybe . 
  pirate and new tech2 battlecruisers though are less of a problem if the roles are n't overlapping . 
  hmmmm spiky bikini sansha battlecruiser with lazors pewpewnomnomnomnom . 
  but errrr drifting out of topic here , we 'd need to make sure current sansha ships are tiericidead before that happens - we heard horror stories about the succubus and phantasm being left to rot for all eternity in station hangars . 
  that is not right . 
  i expect that canes will get a slight power grid nerf . 
  it 's just stupidly easy to fit stuff onto right now . 
  shaving a bit off the grid should stop the ` shield tank + best guns + 2 medium neuts ' no-compromise fit ... 
  i 'm also happy that they 're getting experience balancing the smaller ships before they attempt to balance hulls that are incredibly popular and cherished by players . 
  there will be butthurt , regardless , but it helps when you can say `` see those frigates we did ? 
  they 're now balanced . 
  see those destroyers ? 
  now balanced . 
  and the cruisers ? 
  also balanced . 
  but you [ nerf * one hurricane * ] ( http://www.humorbin.com/showitem.asp?item=20 ) ... '', 
  oh , let 's not do the circumsism debate again . 
  not one of his best posts . 
  post an eveboard link so we can theorytrain . 
  [ state protectorate ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/npc/state_protectorate/stations ) offers a navy scorpion for 150k lp ( negotiable ) , a scorpion and a caldari az-1 nexus chip . 
  i do n't think anyone offers a blueprint though . 
  do all the int/mem prereqs for a tengu + subsystems skills, 
  all navigation skills to iv . 
  seriously . 
  do n't mine without mining upgrades iv . 
  where 's your rigging skills ? 
  you ca n't use overheating . 
  learn thermodynamics, 
  fix up your shield management and operation skills , unless you like buying faction shield boost amps because you ca n't use a sba ii, 
  pick up at least the minimal skills needed to use t2 ecm , tracking disruptors , damps and painters . 
  even if you do n't specialize , they 're good to have . 
  propulsion jamming v . you need it for dics and hics , which are very handy to have in pvp, 
  combat drone operation v. it 's fast and good . 
   his point that people do n't want to deal with more logistics than necessary makes sense, 
  i did n't get that from his post at all . 
  i read it like this :, 
  * if ccp nerfs refining in highsec , miners will still mine in highsec , and just charge 5 % more , because only via highsec can miners actually * produce and transport * the insane volume of materials that eve consumes every day . 
  you have a rohk , you can [ active tank it ] ( http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?291-pvp-rokh&amp;p=478308&amp;viewfull=1#post478308 ) right now , 
  i suggest you join / r/fweddit and make some isk in faction warfare , while getting in on some cheap fights as well . 
  you 're pretty close to having t2 large hybrids , so you should be very close to getting into a naga or talos and doing the solo pvp thing if you choose to ship up into battlecruisers . 
  have you considered not using steam to play eve ? 
  the main benefit of steam ( autopatching ) is n't really applicable for eve . 
  they 're just relocating to amarr space , that 's all . 
  person a mines ore , makes ship . 
  isk neutral . 
  sells ship . 
  isk neutral . 
  ship blows up . 
  insurance money comes out of nowhere . 
  to be perfectly honest , if eve was set up like earth , things would make a lot more sense . 
  highsec is europe . 
  safe , lots of stuff available to buy and concord health care for all . 
  shit be expensive though . 
  low sec is china or india . 
  less laws means cheaper stuff because corners can be cut . 
  less laws also make it a lot less safe , unless youve bribed the right locals . 
  nullsec is central africa . 
  diamond mines ? 
  we got em . 
  oil ? 
  yep . 
  all over the joint . 
  but , not only do you have to build your own factories and train up the natives , you have to build your own roads and electricity and everything . 
  from scratch . 
  and nothing is available to buy that you did n't bring from somewhere else . 
  until some guy with a bunch of child soldiers take them from you . 
  this would actually be quite awesome .
