  sometimes , ` butterfly effect ' moments happen by themselves , and sometimes they need a little push . 
  well , ccp makes a bit more money from a plex than a subscription , but mainly it 's because people who sell plex are giving ** extra ** money to ccp , instead of paying for their sub and whining about being poor . 
  alternatively , they 're a company that has come to the conclusion that hiring someone who is less than stellar is worse than leaving the position vacant . 
  if anyone can take screenshots of any dust-related blueprints they find , post them !, 
  perhaps you have n't been paying attention , but the actual changes get released more often than the major expansions . 
  if they had ` returned to twice-annual changes ' , then nothing except bugfixes would be released between summer and winter . 
  bugger . 
  lem me check whats up, 
  failheap is doing a server move . 
  bad timing . 
  ok , failheap appears to be down , so i 'll recreate this from ~ ~ memory ~ ~ my browser cache .

   so i went on the new test server to take a look a the newest set of dust items . 
  there is stuff here not yet implemented or available in the current dust build . 
  augmentations, 
   boosters, 
   * active boosters, 
  these give you 50 % more sp reward at the end of each match you play, 
   * passive boosters, 
  these are new and appear to be how your ` non-primary ' clones can accrue sp passively . 
  without one they would not accrue sp passively at all . 
  current rate is 1 sp/4 secs or about 750,000 sp per year . 
   universal voice transmitters, 
  these allow players to speak in channels and to corp members when not in a match . 
  a bit controversial , similar to when ccp decided they would charge for eve voice ( but never did in the end ) . 
   more :, 
   squad speed boost module ? 
   profile dampers to make infiltration easier, 
   suit scanner booster ( passive ), 
   skills to the use of the above, 
   explode upon death, 
   looks like a large variety of assualt suit types are planned ? 
  with a females uire coming soon . 
   active scanner equipment, 
   a variety of installations ( none had descriptions as of yet ) which can be placed before and during a match, 
   kill that mcc ( mobile command centre ) more quickly with the very best in future weaponary, 
   laser rifles ( not yet implemented, 
   nova knife now needs to be equiped as does n't come as standard ? 
   hinting at a melee attack which is n't your knife but the but of your gun/rifle ? 
   vehicle remote reps. spider tanking is a go ( this may already be in , but i 've never seen it ), 
   a variety of vehicle modules ( no worthwhile descroptions ), 
   vehicle weapon damage mods, 
   vehicle types . 
  the logistics and black ops versions come with a mobile cru as standard ( you can spawn directly inside the vehicle ), 
   full weapon-type list . 
  av grenades auto-attach to a vehicle if you throw it close enough and do not explode at all if you miss . 
  flux grenades destryo sheilds and equipment . 
  locus grenades are good for suit armor . 
  i got some [ bad news ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2012/06/18/sonys-free-to-play-online-shooter-planetside-2-will-pack-2000-players-in-an-arena-interview/ ) for you , hoss . 
  have you tried flying to arnon and talking to sister alitura ? 
  the sisters of eve have an epic mission arc that can be done a few times per year . 
  once every 3 months i believe , same as all the epic arcs . 
  wait , i think i follow your blog . 
  no wonder they were so touchy when i flew past there a few minutes ago on my way from venal . 
  that is not a bad system , actually . 
  well , it depends who you ask . 
  the ** world ** taekwondo federation ( mostly americans ) claim that tkd has a 4500 year history . 
  the ** international ** taekwondo federation ( mostly koreans ) claim that their founder invented tkd in the 1940 's when asked by the korean army for a hand-to-hand training plan . 
  it was a hit , so he thought `` maybe i 'm onto something '' so he wrote a book and developed it into a full-fledged martial art . 
  i wish i could have a hedgehog in australia :(, 
  importing exotic species into australia attracts penalties not dissimilar to drug trafficking . 
  to clarify : what the csm proposed . 
  new players should always fit a damage control imo .

   dear space tribe ,, 
   i 'm curious to hear from those of you who have gone above and beyond and contributed something to the community outside of just playing eve . 
  it could be that you run a blog , make songs , report on events , host player gatherings , make tutorials , create videos , run a fan site or create programs and apps to help your fellow pilots enjoy eve . 
  this is by no means a definitive list of community contributions , only some examples . 
   what i 'm interested to know is how making those contributions has affected you as an eve player and/or how it 's affected your life beyond the game and the community . 
  what have you learned , what skills have you discovered that you did n't know you had , what doors have been opened etc etc. 
   reply here and do n't be shy ( but in case you are , feel free to send me a private message instead ), 
  just because the obvious stuff has already been implemented ( badly ) does n't mean you should give up . 
  so much this . 
  i am amazed that the pi team could deliver such a beautiful-looking system that is fundamentally static and uninteresting . 
  some game mechanics are fundamentally utilitarian ( e.g. 
  manufacturing ) . 
  planetary management should be a bit more fun than that . 
   hence the focus on tiericide and all that . 
  which reminds me , gon na post a [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/hansshotfirst/status/243710074235809792 ) i found . 
  looks like ship rebalancing is going a lot faster than expected ... 
  well , when you obsolete all the mining cruisers , you kinda need to do something fast . 
  considering some people make a billion per day , i do n't think balancing stuff like that using cost is a good idea . 
  my 97-year-old great uncle passed away last year , and one topic of conversation that always came up ( if you talked with him long enough ) was the great depression . 
  he mentioned that one of the most heartbreaking things he saw were ' * women * humping their swag down the road ' , looking for work . 
  ( emphasis his ), 
  her modest [ proposal ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/393/965/82f.jpg ) ... 
  op success , then . 
  she [ has n't aged well ] ( http://majorkarnage.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/whatginawants-b.jpg ) , no .

  that adds insult to injury . 
  a lot of nullsec plays fail at step one ( logging in ), 
  all fleets love slashers , atrons or whatever light tackle is available . 
  t2 interceptors are also appreciated . 
  most small ship combat seems to be centralized around faction warfare , though . 
  he was pretty good in sweeny todd . 
  good singing voice , too .
