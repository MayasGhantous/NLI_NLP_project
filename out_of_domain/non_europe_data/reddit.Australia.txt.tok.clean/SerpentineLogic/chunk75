  welcome to the [ anarcho-capitalist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarcho-capitalism ) political system of eve online . 
  ^ ^ ( p.s. & nbsp ; never & nbsp ; give & nbsp ; in & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; ransom & nbsp ; demands ), 
  why do people donate to political parties ? 
  starship troopers is stand-alone ; start with that one . 
  confirming his turgidity . 
  maybe that was his ` application fee ', 
   air-tight seals, 
  that 's animal abuse !, 
  and yet the entire rest of the cast did n't faze you ? 
  he admitted it ? 
  phew , one less secret i have to keep . 
  there are a number of things you can ` do ' while away from the keyboard or even logged in . 
  some things are on timers that tick over whether you 're logged in or not :, 
  * planetary extraction, 
  * manufacturing, 
  * research, 
  * moon extraction, 
  some things depend on others , and can happen at any time :, 
  * contracts, 
  * trade, 
  and some commands that work while you 're not at keyboard are supported by the eve client :, 
  * fleet boosting bonuses, 
  * autopiloting, 
  * mining ( well , kinda ), 
  record it ? 
  i hope so , too . 
  there 's #tweetfleet on twitter . 
  also , i hear there 's an eve subreddit you could hang out in . 
  not 100 % ok . a [ guy i knew ] ( http://themittani.com/news/rip-vile-rat ) was murdered yesterday :(, 
  i read it as `` whole bunch of people prepared to go into battle against civillians wearing spiked `` fuck the police '' ** heels ** '' . 
  just because a bastard is on your side does n't negate the existence of his bastardry . 
  i did n't want this post to be lost in the outpouring of grief .

   btw , in case some are wondering why he and the other state dept officials were caught behind while the rest were able to get out in time :, 
   i can confirm that statement above is correct from my work , and that sean literally died in service to his country to destroy sensitive information to prevent the possibility of said secret information falling into enemy hands that could ( and would ) result in the deaths of others . 
   he died because he put duty and the service of the nation first before his own personal safety . 
   it 's not much consolation because it will never fill the void , but goddamn it , he was a genuine hero . 
  for those who ca n't access disqus :, 
   i 'd like to thank all of you for the kind comments about sean . 
  i worked with him and we both have the same job for the dept. 
  of state . 
  i thought that you may like to know why he was there till the end and did n't leave with everyone else . 
  one of the requirements of our job is that we control all of the secret and cryptology equipment at embassy 's and consulate 's . 
  while the non-essential staff were allowed to get out , he had to stick it out until everything was destroyed to keep it from falling into hostile hands which could put more lives at risk . 
  he was a great communicator and friend and he will be missed in our small community as he will be missed in yours . 
   thanks again ,, 
   norm, 
  ok then , join fweddit and go hunting in a cheap thrasher for a month or two . 
  eve is a text game the same way that microsoft excel is a beautifully-rendered spaceship sim . 
  surprisingly , it 's working .

  tldr ; [ summary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ), 
  truly , we live in an age of wonder . 
  it 's ok , he [ roleplays a girl ] ( http://image.eveonline.com/character/102216341_256.jpg ) . 
  we can watch fox news via the internet , if we want . 
  we do n't . 
  they 're keeping it . 
  make it so . 
  cant we do both ? 
  1 . miner + manufacture + science works well . 
  trader can be done with any character but works best as a separate alt , or on the science guy . 
  exploration works with both but tends to be more useful on a combat character . 
  cosmos guide : google it, 
  1 . tbh , unless your corp is  30 players , just use eve voice and use the money you save on handing out free thrashers like candy . 
  turret, 
  hams generally only get used in pvp and specialized fits . 
  for regular pve use hmls . 
  1 . yes,

  message me your email address and ill send you a trial . 
  edit : trial sent . 
  sure , just message me your email address . 
  eve is n't so fast-paced that bluetooth headsets ca n't keep up , although i suggest staying away from them anyway , because the audio delay is really annoying for anything else . 
  some faction stuff is better than t2 ; other items are equivalent , but easier to fit in some way , be it cpu , powergrid or skill level requirements . 
  yes . 
  i would have a programmable keyboard with macros bound for more complex commands , like `` rolling safe time . 
  unassigned fast tackle burn away and everyone else keep warping to zero on them '', 
  first off , i suggest you do a neural remap for maximum intelligence , with the rest in perception ( or more balanced between int and per if you prefer ) . 
  the rationale is that support skills ( engineering/mechanics et al - all intelligence-based ) are where all new players are deficient , and it generally takes a few months of training support skills before they 're ` good enough ' . 
  in the meantime , the perception attribute is useful for training gunnery/missile/ship skills . 
  the eventual aim is to remap again into max per/will so you can train up all those advanced gunnery and piloting skills , but you 'd best have decent support skills before you make the switch . 
  secondly , plug in some cheap implants for int and perception . 
  even +1 implants will save you half an hour of skill training each day . 
  that adds up . 
  +3 implants are generally all that new players can afford , so do n't go overboard unless you 're flush with cash ( even then , i would n't go for +5 implants ), 
  thirdly , take a look at [ this skill plan ] ( https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/basic_30_day_plan ) . 
  its not the right race of ships , and it 's not the right weapon type ( guns vs missiles ) , but the rationale behind the decisions is still worth learning . 
  obviously , you 'd end up flying a kestrel and caracal instead , since they 're the staple caldari missile boats , but the idea is the same . 
  best of luck with the cochlear . 
  ive seen the videos . 
  bear in mind thats a mixed pve/pvp plan . 
  dreddit is good but not for everyone . 
  you can read the eve uni wiki even if you dont join ; its a great resource . 
  not helpful without the system to form up in .
