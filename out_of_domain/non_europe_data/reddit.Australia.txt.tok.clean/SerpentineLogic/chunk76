  in low-sec , conducting aggressive actions will lower your security status , and gates and stations will fire on you for the next 15 minutes ( if your sec status drops too low , then you are an outlaw and get no such support from gate guns , and anyone can shoot you without losing sec status themselves ), 
  in null-sec , certain weapons forbidden in low-sec are allowed , like bombs and warp disruption * fields * , and there are no gate guns or other consequences of aggression . 
  conveniently , such skills come at a time in an eve player 's career where they go `` phew , amarr carrier v is training , so i do n't * have * to login until next month . '', 
  get new friends . 
  its likely that blues will be shot :-), 
  there will be hidden kickbacks . 
  so , space high slot for a cloak , and gas mining bonus . 
  ** w ** hatever could it be u ** s ** ed for ? 
  well , i have a 2011 mbp, 
  2g core i7, 
  4gb ddr3, 
  intel hd graphics 3000 384 mb ( or amd radeon hd 6490m in eve ), 
  running lion, 
  and it works fine in 1280 x 800 windowed, 
  my settings are :, 
  * aa : disabled, 
  * post-processing : none, 
  * shader : medium, 
  * texture : medium, 
  * lod : low, 
  * shadow : disabled, 
  * interior effects : low, 
  * interior shader : low, 
  so if it does n't work on your mac , i suggest using bootcamp or parallels and using the windows version . 
  also , turn off steam while you play : it occasionally interacts badly with eve . 
  it 's a mystery . 
  having said that , i suspect its slot layout will be substantially similar to that of the noctis , since they 're both high-slot heavy industrial vessels . 
  yes , because battlecruisers are * famed * for their industrial extraction capability . 
  dude your corp is two people . 
  procurers wont always be 6 million isk ... 
  warp stabs wo n't save you from artillery . 
  he 's recruiting for a micro-corp inside an alliance whose killboard is a sea of red , with a < 6 % efficiency , with recent tower losses . 
  pardon me for being skeptical of the value proposition of his offer . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://fulldisclosureeve.wordpress.com ) has a corp or two you might like to join . 
  undock vectors are randomised by five degrees or so . 
  not much you can do about it . 
  i believe you ~, 
  they are . 
  ill bet you one destroyer that it wont . 
  to be fair , those ship classes are shit . 
  it means +2 warp strength is not a precious snowflake , guarded jealously by the monks of tech two . 
  something that was cherished thusly : the mackinaw 's ice bonus , and we all know how that turned out . 
  dust dropship ? 
  caldari stations with retarded spurs fucking up aligning suggest otherwise . 
  what kind of things do you want to do , anyway ? 
  p v e ? 
  p v p ? 
  industry ? 
  trade ? 
  exploration ? 
  if you have 5 million sp , you should be looking for a corp that does what you want to do , rather than a general noob corp that replicates what 's already available on eve university 's wiki . 
  faction warfare is a credible alternative , yes . 
  trading in items that can be manufactured is risky . 
  concentrate on stuff that come from item drops , since they cant be farmed by someone trying to close market gaps . 
  pirate and dead-space modules , certain tags etc. 
  that 's all his , mate ,

  i suggest you do [ the blood-stained stars ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/the_blood-stained_stars ) missions , then join fweddit and get some lowsec pvp and pve action . 
  perhaps they never found the guys . 
  the old northern coalition was actually a lot like the british commonwealth , even down to the small details like getting smashed up by a bunch of germans and russians and losing their empire .

  : cripes :, 
  they have the dna evidence stored away ; that has to count for something . 
   but uh , t1 is n't very profitable, 
  have you considered [ fuel blocks ] ( http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprints/4247/42/5/20/5 ) ? 
  tier 3 battlecruisers are a thing . 
  they 're * fairly * good . 
  lots of ship classes , weapons and gallente got buffed , and a major ship rebalance effort is underway . 
  in fact , [ a lot has changed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) just in the last year . 
  up to 16k an hour later . 
  you 're lucky i read the post , or i would have given you the * biggest * blue arrow-shaped wedgie . 
  i think theres a topical cream you can apply to fix that . 
  its in there already . 
  to be honest , you 're better off with blasters on a gallente boat . 
  sure , you 'll have to get within 1-2 km of your target , but you should be able to put the hurt on them . 
  use a web , too . 
  those things rock . 
  so much better than the official eve surveys . 
  that tower on top looks out of place . 
  for belt clearing , yes . 
  noctis has an absurdly fast shield recharge time , so a single lse works wonders . 
  your ship is equally to blame . 
  put it on a larger ship and you will find it will be cap stable . 
  of course , on a larger ship it will be inadequate comparef to the volume of incoming fire , but there you go . 
  no , i mean the [ eve surveys ] ( http://inferno.questionpro.com/ ) . 
  guys , if you 're going to downvote , please post an explanation . 
  * energy management, 
  * energy systems operation, 
  plus whatever you need to fit cap rechargers , flux coils , cap power relays , capacitor control circuits or other capacitor-enhancing modules, 
  the gallente model looks a bit like a ww2 bomber , and the amarr model looks like the art department trolling us . 
  according to penthouse forum , that could happen to anybody . 
  if you 're extra hardcore , drink the brennivin first . 
  i do n't recommend it , though . 
  i was trying to make the point that different ships have different-sized capacitors , and thus something that may cap you out in one ship may not even affect a different one . 
  i can see how i totally botched the explanation tho , ha . 
   the reason rape is punished as severely as it is is its effect on the victim . 
  if the victim regards an act as `` uncomfortable '' , is it legitimate to regard it as rape ?
