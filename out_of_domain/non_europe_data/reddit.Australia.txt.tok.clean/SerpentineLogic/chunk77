  if the ** attacker ** does n't know that , then hell yes . 
  `` ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... '', 
  insta-damp cruisers . 
  an exploit : no . 
  something that ccp should fix , like they did [ the last time ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/the-story-behind-afk-complex-farming/ ) this issue cropped up ? 
  yes . 
  and eventually , your ore hold will fill up , unlike , your wallet from bounties . 
  tags . 
  tags everywhere . 
  ( this is how they should have fixed the drone regions ), 
  a vexor works fairly well for doing the sites that a frigate cant handle . 
  omengeddon , thoraxathon and stabbabond are going to be a lot of fun to try out . 
  amarr carrier v is great . 
  fighters v is nice to have , but not mandatory . 
  jumo drive calibration v * is * mandatory . 
  i expected the big range nerf to heavy missiles . 
  not so sure about the big damage nerf . 
  can someone explain the reasoning behind this ? 
  which , aside from 720mms , nobody uses . 
  oh well , at least theyre consistent now . 
  then fit a tracking enhancer and notice how it owns . 
  conversely , turrets can ameliorate tracking disruption by managing transversal , whereas missile users ca n't . 
  web . 
  james315 's posts are usually just shoeboxes full of his sperging , so it 's a total shock to see something of his that actually makes sense ( at times ) . 
  jester had it right when he said that trit and pyerite are so expensive because you need massive volumes of it ( we 're talking hundreds of freighters per day just to feed jita ) . 
  and since the drone region nerf , veldspar and scordite are the best sources of those minerals . 
  and if you 're going to mine veld or scordite , you * might as well * do it in highsec where you get concord for free . 
  any solution has to address both supply and demand . 
  this means :, 
  * ways to mine low-ends faster outside of highsec ( tech 3 crystals , capital mining barges i do n't care how0, 
  * tweak the mineral ratios on certain items ( this is already done for new stuff , starting from the nocxiumtis ), 
  * bonus : add some high-end asteroids to lowsec , since the risk of low-sec belt mining is * at least * as high as in nullsec . 
   tldr ; a single asb is balanced , two asbs are not . 
  you needed an analysis document for that ? 
  still , it 's a good writeup . 
  some improvements :, 
  * do a graph with dual xlasb . 
  * put an lse as comparison in graphs that include an lasb, 
  the voting method that csm7 proposed is close to the way that the [ australian senate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senate_%28australia%29#voting_system ) is chosen . 
  however , there 's one crucial difference :, 
   once a candidate has been elected with votes reaching the quota amount , ** any votes they receive in addition to this may be distributed to other candidates as preferences . 
  i have no idea why they did n't keep this clause in . 
  i do n't think the problem is running them both at the same time . 
  the problem is running them sequentially . 
  scanning can be hard ( eve university has a visual guide that may help ) . 
  most new players tag along with someone else , so fleetmates can get you to warp to them instead of needing to scan down potentially hostile ships . 
  combat boosters are very difficult to make isk from , mostly due to the difficulties making them available for sale . 
  atap has a pdf floating around , but generally it 's something that will lose you a lot of isk . 
  the best part of eve university is the wiki . 
  no need to join imo . 
  if you want a newbie-friendly corp that is n't so popular , a few eve bloggers started up [ project halibut ] ( http://projecthalibut.org/about/ ) which you 're welcome to join . 
  i still doubt it would work . 
  you drop the tanking a bit , but you still have the problem that you have neut-safe permatanking until your cargohold is empty , which i do n't think is in the spirit of what the game designers intended . 
  er , high-end asteroids are are arkanor , bistot and crokite , not veld and scord . 
  although , you are right in that the highsec ores should be all throughout new eden . 
  the problem with his posts is that i do n't want to get three pages in before realising that he 's roleplaying a retard again . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  cfc and/or hbc would get a lot of seats on the council , true . 
  however , everyone who voted for someone who did n't get in would have their vote count for someone else , so you 'll see a lot of the more popular ` also-rans ' getting a shot this time . 
  unless it 's stupidly profitable , just put up a small amarr/gallente tower + silo + moon miner + a corp hangar within 2500m of both . 
  resources : unless you have access to certain regions , you have to buy gas at market price . 
  gas is bulky and only useful to a few people so nobody mines gas if they can help it . 
  in addition , the blueprints used to make them are rare , because selling blueprints is a hassle and only a few people want them anyway, 
  production : generally , you need a pos tower to react boosters , generally a medium or bigger . 
  this is a non-trivial amount of fuel you 're spending, 
  transport . 
  you ca n't put boosters in courier contracts so you have a lot of hassles avoiding faction police and trying to get them to highsec for sale . 
  even then , whoever buys them ca n't go through gates without the same hassles , so you have to sell them in the exact system where the demand is . 
  sale . 
  you ca n't make sell contracts for boosters , so unless you want to put them on the open market , you need to use the trade window or get creative with buy contracts to get them to your corpies, 
  boosters are very good , and generally worth the isk used to buy them . 
  however , supply and transport is constrained so much that they just have n't taken off . 
  ccp greyscale floated the idea of taking away their penalties , but backed off when it was conveyed to him just how bad it would be to have demand skyrocket with the current massive constraints to supply and distribution . 
   i lack the connections to find people who 'd let me willingly salvage them . 
  ` let you ' ? 
  there are corps that [ charge them ] ( https://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/salvaging-service-theres-a-corp-for-that/ ) to salvage . 
  join them for a month or two . 
  the challenge is to work out what is . 
  try it , its fun . 
  i support autolooting . 
  if they wanted permatanking , they wouldnt have put in a 60 second reload ... 
  to be fair , there has been a bit of [ suspicious activity ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1040dz/til_a_wealthy_hedge_fund_manager_is_accused_of/c6aa60g ) on this topic . 
  if you 're a newbro with meagre scanning skills , it 's more like gargling a flagon of dicks . 
  wormholes : the end-game content that anyone can find . 
  the days of a_puppetmaster putting a 30 % deposit on his apartment in italy courtesy of real-money trading , or vuk lau 's nightclub , are long gone . 
  all hail the space fish . 
  i love posts like this . 
  i especially like when they [ blog about it ] ( http://diaries-of-a-space-noob.blogspot.com/2012/06/preface.html ) ( he 's up to day 92 ), 
  finally , less cryptic titles . 
  otec affects t2 stuff only . 
  so fit a powergrid rig . 
  it does talk about it from a fleet fight context , which is what youd expect them to be looking at it from, 
  people in the west kill their spouses for the insurance money . 
  same thing . 
  \\* blink \\*, 
  maybe there 's a corp in talocan empire that would suit you .
