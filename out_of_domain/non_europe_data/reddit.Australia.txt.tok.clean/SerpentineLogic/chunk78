  that ship has sailed . 
  i suspect an incoming range nerf on tracking disruptors .

  just get a 21 day trial . 
  if you run out , just ask for another . 
  i went through six trials before i decided to subscribe . 
  depends on what exactly it will do . 
  a web makes a hell of a difference . 
  join faction warfare . 
  did we ever find out what ` project a ' ( and all the other codenames you guys in csm 6 and 7 ) ended up being ? 
  1-6 : either nothing/genolution , or slaves ( high-grade , with low or high omega depending on cost ), 
  7 : motion prediction, 
  8 : energy management, 
  9 : surgical strike, 
  10 : hull upgrades, 
  perhaps asians are more fond of building dynasties than westerners . 
  i do n't even, 
  did that get renamed along with akemon 's implant ? 
  akemon 's noble is a flat 8 % armor , unlike the imperial navy noble , which is a hybrid +3 % rep rate and +3 % rep amount , which does n't fit a single skill . 
  i imagine ogden and pashan 's implants will be rationalised in a similar way . 
  nowhere , any more . 
  imo , dont fly a laser boat without t2 lasers . 
  mise well crank out a few runs then . 
  the entire ** point ** of eve is that you pay to get access to the universe . 
  alternatively , evetimecode.com has discount codes so you can pay less rl money . 
  depends on your situation i guess . 
  not if you need a tower for it , trust me . 
  message me . 
  i know a few . 
  in my experience , twenty seconds later rote kapelle cynos * their * capitals in . 
  all 8 probes affect scan results now , also . 
  oh yeah , holding the alt key is new as well . 
  syndicate . 
  message me and i can suggest some stations to base out of . 
  i hope you have trained the connections skill ... 
  the best thing about syndicate is that , generally , it 's only one cyno away from highsec so it 's easy to evacuate if it turns out you are n't suited for life there . 
  well , the 20 billion monthly donations from gevlon must help . 
  the most obvious way is to supply the low-sec faction warfare hubs with pvp stuff . 
  for a while there , fweddit was based in [ ishomilken ] ( http://eve-marketdata.com/stock_station.php?step=recommend2&amp;solarsystem_name=ishomilken&amp;only_profitable=1 ) . 
  it 's called honor tanking . 
  `` only someone without honor would invade us . '', 
  ^ ( not that we could stop them even if we spent our entire gdp on our military ), 
  5 ) start reading .

  you could use a cloaky hauler , but to be honest , a frigate with a couple of warp stabs is a lot cheaper when all you 're doing is bringing in 10k rounds of republic fleet emp . 
  perhaps because you are n't an accountant ? 
  or as i like to call them , an a/cant, 
  ( it 's not the usual way to abbreviate account though . ), 
  it 'll be in there somewhere . 
  from what i 've seen , few chavs are immigrants . 
  eve university policies are designed to protect ultra-newbies who do n't have a concept of risk vs reward ( i.e. 
  they undock into wardecs with ships they ca n't afford to lose ) unless you are stupendously muddleheaded , you 're beyond that . 
  ten million skill points is not really ` new ' . 
  by this stage , you should be branching out and seeing what kinds of stuff you like doing . 
  get a cheap frigate and go into low-sec . 
  kill a few of the 1-million-isk npc battleships you can farm there . 
  do some exploration and scavenge some radar sites that hardly anyone goes to , because they 're afraid of low-sec . 
  heck , eventually you 'll get chased by someone . 
  fight back . 
  experience the adrenaline rush of high-stakes , someone 's - going-home-in-a-pod spaceship combat , and you 'll wonder why people play any other game than eve . 
  or , you know , do some mining or whatever . 
  10 million skill points and still in eve university is like the 35-year old still living in their parents house and complaining about doing chores . 
  when you find out , tell me . 
  i basically log in for industry jobs and wait for the ` cap fleet log in ' jabber ping . 
  ^ ( ps my alliance does n't have jabber ), 
  damn awoxers [ burned down ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichstag_fire ) my reichstag . 
  any of the exploration frigates will have a decent-sized cargo hold . 
  imicus is more for the expliration side . 
  an incursus or tristan would be better for combat . 
  ideally a tech2 frigate , but they are a fair bit more expensive for the edge they provide . 
  i have killed my share in an incursus . 
  battleships have a hard time hitting an afterburning frigate . 
  sure . 
  any of the rank2 skills affect anyone in fleet that you are booster for . 
  a lot of people train them to iv and leave it at that . 
  the market does n't work that way . 
  when you buy , you buy from whoever 's selling it cheapest , regardless of what price you offer . 
  stops isk laundering and general market stats-breaking . 
  say you want to launder a billion isk , because you 're worried that ccp knows about your botting network . 
  you put up a sell order for tritanium of 1 billion isk on a clean character . 
  if you could buy that specific order , then the laundering would be successful . 
  as it is now , that loophole is closed . 
  and a chauffeur for jeff . 
  driver fatigue is serious . 
  or maybe it 's the fact that it was a british colony , like all the other countries that call it ` tomato sauce ' . 
  just make sure you have the skills to remotely complete/start jobs , since you wo n't be able to dock ... 
  the tier three battlecruisers are the naga , oracle , talos and tornado . 
  i suppose . 
  or you could fit a tank or tracking disruptor ( for the other ships ) and just burn out of point range . 
  there 's a few things you can do to make it better . 
  specialize into one tank + 1 dps fit ( will only work until ccp changes rat ai ), 
  let a noob corp mate salvage while you blitz missions . 
  you get all the rewards and faster mission completion , they get the salvage , which you already treat as a chore . 
  ** do something better than level 4 missions ** ( level 5 missions , incursions , wormhole-diving etc ), 
  there 's a sony blog about how the ( at present ) top-end dust gear only costs 24 cents per fit-out . 
  24c = 48 aur = ~ 6.8 million isk ( assuming 3.5 k aurum = 1 plex = 500m isk ),
