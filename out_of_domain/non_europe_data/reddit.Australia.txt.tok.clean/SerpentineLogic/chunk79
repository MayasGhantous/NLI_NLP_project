  so , every time you headshot that smug 1 % bastard , you 've cost him as much as a t2-fit frigate . 
  considering that he could die two dozen times per hour , that 's gon na add up . 
  or , you could fire them for , you know , * shoddy work * . 
  til most of the humanity are greedy fucks . 
  so , if you want good equipment without waiting for t2 ( or whatever they have ) then you spend aurum . 
  seems fair . 
  you presuppose a few things there . 
  that drug use leads to poor performance . 
  that your drug tests actually catch the drugs that * do * lead to poor performance ( lol executives taking long lunches ), 
  1 . that the drug tests are [ reliable ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/30/1035683474902.html ), 
  that you save more money not hiring certain people than you spend on drug tests, 
  the only time i have been drug tested was when i was at work sites in the mining industry , where an accident could easily be fatal . 
  from what i 've seen from dust interviews , prototype aurum gear appears to be better than anything else . 
  you 'd have a lot more isk if you subscribed for a few months instead of near-bankrupting yourself buying plex . 
  if it 's a bomb fit , then yes . 
  if it 's a mse+ab+bcs blackops fit , then you should be fine . 
  feel free to fit a tracking disruptor or damp , especially if you are fitting for additional torp range . 
  to be honest , it 's less hassle to just buy them off the market . 
  the probes would be the first thing you 'd get , since they 're fairly cheap . 
  assuming you can dock nearby ... 
  this happened to me just now . 
  til, 
  it was probably the goonswarm 60 day plan . 
  in fact , whenever i swap to a combat clone , i adjust whatever skill i 'm training to suit whichever two implants i have in them . 
   any skill planning advice for an aspiring miner ? 
  remap int + memory ( personally , i maxed int because , imo there 's more science + support skills that are int/mem than there are mem/int skills in the industry tree ), 
  you will end up with refining skills anyway , because they 're a prerequisite for using mining laser crystals . 
  if you get refinery efficiency iii and some ore-specific processing skills , you should have zero waste ( aside from station refining fees ), 
  start planning for what you want to do with your character after it maxes out mining . 
  the mining skill tree is fairly shallow . 
  my mining alt went into manufacturing and research , but i think i 'll have trained everything i want * well * before it hits 1 year old . 
  personally , i 'd just start another character on the same account once your mining character is situated where you want it . 
  that way you can specialise in a totally different field , like shooting stuff . 
  yes you do . 
  that 's why you check directional scan ~ ~ from time to time ~ ~ always , looking for scan or combat probes . 
  alternatively , make friends with the local residents so they 'll have your back if push comes to shove .

   hey guys ,, 
   we have gone through and made some change to what is listed on the market and how it is organized . 
  if you have any feedback on this please let me know . 
   * faction drones are now listed on the market . 
   * faction pos towers are now on the market . 
   * outpost construction eggs are now listed on the market . 
   * drone upgrades have been moved from drones to ship equipment . 
  they are modules so it makes more sense . 
   * all pos weapon batteries are now under starbase -  structures -  weapon batteries . 
   * blueprints now make more sense . 
  i have reorganized a large percent of the blueprints category . 
  the structure should now resemble the rest of the market . 
   * faction pos modules are now on the market . 
   * added the same faction filtering you find in ship equipment to drones and structures . 
  that being the little sub-categories for faction or officer . 
   * ** re-organizing the subsystems to be race -  subsystem type instead of subsystem type -  race **, 
  well in that case , to the deletemobile !, 
  one skill level in whichever skill cost the most skillpoints to get . 
  the miner-bashing does get a bit old . 
  mining is a little dull after a while , but to be honest , so does shooting plus signs or idling in a pos shield waiting for some russians to login . 
  truth is , most mining characters can be rehabilitated , at the very least into an orca alt . 
  that 's a shame . 
  recon v is up there with logistics v and battlecruisers v ; i.e. 
  the best level 5 skills ever . 
  what is it you want to * do * with the pos ? 
  player owned starbase . 
  browse market , show info . 
  yeah you dont lose the * entire * skill level , unlike going down in a tengu or whatever . 
  you lose a level of a subsystem skill . 
  stuff in the corporate hangar bay, 
  * does n't show up on a cargo scan, 
  * never drops . 
  it has been known to put ancillary shield boosters in the implants section . 
  make a blog , we 'll follow you like a covert proteus in w-space . 
  no , but there is a [ similar tool ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/drk-industry-planner/ ) available . 
  the main ones are, 
  * mining, 
  * astrogeology, 
  * mining upgrades, 
  * mining barge, 
  procurers are like 6 million isk , mine quite quickly , and have a 12000m ^ 3 ore bay . 
  much better than the osprey . 
   can you train one with a trial account though ? 
  nope . 
  i 'd start looking in the west germany part of berlin . 
  i would have gone for the procurer , because its so cheap . 
  just post a screenshot, 
  the start of angel incursions ? 
  one can only hope . 
  or maybe they 're getting revenge for the dramiel nerf . 
  i believe the senate would be more likely . 
  so brave, 
  the promo ship is an iteron 4 . 
  custom taxation software is n't needed . 
  just go to dotlan and bill the ceo of each alliance 10m for each corp member . 
  worrying about every penny and who 's ` paying their share ' is not worth your time if you do n't have an api wizard handy , so just make do and get on with the job . 
  i would wager it wouldnt . 
  something something merc pack . 
  full marks for enthusiasm , zero marks for planning . 
  eve tribune has [ a list ] ( http://www.eve-tribune.com/index.php?no=3_16&amp;page=1 ), 
  i have fought with and against them . 
  theyre pretty cool . 
  caveat : it is a bit old .
