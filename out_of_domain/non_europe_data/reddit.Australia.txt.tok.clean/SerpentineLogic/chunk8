  note that you wo n't be able to do much industry without converting to a paid account . 
  ** want a freighter pilot ? 
  * remap perception/willpower , train racial freighter iv and any per/will prereqs for a jump freighter , just in case . 
  * remap int/mem and do whatever ( invention , mining ( probably not ) , manufacturing , whatever ), 
  * follow [ the plan ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/creating_an_alt_miner ), 
  * being able to fly an orca is useful , so that 's a decent goal, 
  * eventually move to nullsec/wspace with your shiny new rorqual, 
  ** want a pi character ? 
  * you only need about 800k skill points to do pi at level iv so not really worth a new account for , unless you make three of them . 
  if you are willing to put in the effort , three pi characters can easily pay for the account subscription . 
  ** want a trade character ? 
  * train one on your main account ; they do n't take long to make . 
  trade is player-skill dependent , not character-skill dependent . 
  the ones that affect your profit are :, 
  * accounting, 
  * broker relations, 
  the other skills just provide convenience or give you extra open orders ; train them as you need them . 
  you probably wo n't need more than retail iii for a while . 
  oh , and all chacters can do with one or two levels of contracting so they can get stuff couriered around the place or sell stuff conveniently . 
  as for manufacturing , it 's a cut-throat , high-volume low-margin business , so the best way to compete is to find a niche market and serve it instead . 
  for instance , if you 're the guy making useful ships and ammo one jump from providence , saving people from shlepping to jita , then maybe you can get some extra margin over the hundreds of people trying to compete against each other in jita . 
  generally , manufacturers do well by making bulky stuff ( ships etc ) closer to where they 're sold , whereas traders do well with easily-transported goods ( assuming you do n't just sit in a station and buy and sell from there ), 
  this is by design , 
  fucking with own alliance is its own reward . 
  sometimes they drop a nightmare bpc and an a-type eanm . 
  other times all you get is the overseer effects . 
  so , run havens and hubs until you get an escalation . 
  i 've soloed serpentis fleet shipyards in a tengu before . 
  * astrometrics and assorted skills , especially the one that improves scan strength, 
  * covert ops iv so you can fly cheap cloaked covops frigates to scan stuff out and bookmark them ( can be done in a t1 exploration frigate in highsec , or any ship at all if your skills are high ), 
  * something to run the sites ( a battlecruiser works fine in highsec ), 
  after you skill up , you can do everything on the one ship , using an [ exploration tengu ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/#exploration ) . 
  interdiction nullifier in lowsec ? 
  if you 're in highsec or have access to highsec , [ process stuff ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) . 
  i 'll make a nullsec extraction guide when i next head out there , but it basically involves a crapload of p1 and someone to haul it . 
  you wo n't have the cpu or powergrid to do anything except keep up with the p0 output of a nullsec extraction farm . 
  a one-extractor setup needing nine basic factories is not uncommon , hence the p1 export . 
  you then run single barren planet like you would in highsec , processing the thousands of p1 you make per day into a single p3 so it can be transported to jita or consumed in-situ . 
  my last foray into nullsec was raking in 300 robotics per day , i.e. 
  700 million isk per month . 
  all on 800k skill points invested in pi . 
  medium tech2 smartbomb should clear out hornet-ec300s with 2 activations , which is what , 8 seconds ? 
   someone told me yesterday there was even a pirate version of eve uni somewhere . 
  might be [ ouch ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/open+university+of+celestial+hardship ) ? 
  they 'll soon find out ~,

  the proteus is the only t3 that retains a semblance of damage output when fit with the cloak subsystem . 
  sneaking up on someone , bumping them to break your cloak then going to town with your conveniently-in-range blasters is great feeling . 
  something like this does-it-all fit would work .

  or arrange for fights by joining red vs blue . 
  rvb pvp does n't wreck your sec status , so you can happily fly out of the combat constellation and go do some of the easier incursion sites , or mission or whatever . 
  or occasionally spend $ 35 for two plex and sell them for a billion isk worth of pvp ships ... 
  + structure implants are totally worth using on a freighter alt . 
  + warp speed , too . 
  in fact , i [ wrote a thing ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/freighter-pilot-implants/ ) about it once . 
  yeah , it can [ backfire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_rebellion_of_1857 ) though . 
  social democrats is a socialist philosophy that believes that convincing people of the merits of socialism would lead to a socialist state without requiring a revolution ( hence the name ), 
  christian democrats presumably want to do their thing the same way . 
  it 's refreshing in its honesty . 
  relevant username . 
  i do n't think two step was at the summit , or he would have called the other csm members on their retardedness ; he did send a list of suggestions for them read out to ccp though . 
  ** edit : ** [ confirmed ] ( http://twostep4csm.blogspot.com/2012/01/my-take-on-december-csm-summit.html ), 
  currently , all the tier-1 battlecruisers are tank and tier-2 battlecruisers are gank ( except for gallente ), 
  changing the drake to be a mini-raven would make it align with this design philosophy . 
  would be nice if the outpost could be destroyed tho . 
  then you die in a bubble the next day . 
  generally its best to keep the mwd for flexibility . 
  just like honey badger , it shows that you do n't give a fuck . 
  why would you be a pet , if it 's so terrible an existence ? 
  at least you arrive at the other side without a black screen . 
  so , some alliances prefer guests , and others prefer renters ? 
  that 's how ccp works , but i 'm not sure whether console gamers have such patience . 
  they mostly open at night . 
  mostly . 
  nighthawks are pretty decent for level 5 missions since they can operate under neut pressure . 
  you wo n't get a lot of dps though , since your lows will be full of shield power relays . 
  you can active tank a nighthawk to free up the lows for damage modules ; have n't tried it myself but i imagine would be fairly exciting .
