  yes it 's profitable , but uneven income . 
  some days you spend 8 hours and end up with 20 million isk . 
  the next day , the first site you scan gives up a deadspace invulnerability field worth hundreds of millions . 
  better skills increase the types of sites that are possible for you to scan to 100 % . 
  with low skills , you will need an exploration frigate to scan and a bigger ship to run the site . 
  more experience will help you learn how to scan down sites faster . 
  better combat skill training will help you take on more advanced sites .

  there 's a joke in there about training to drink american beer . 
  no high sec connections between empires ? 
  please, 
  theres only a few hundred guys who play ( international sport of your choice ) . 
  yet their games are still watched by many because they are entertaining . 
  test alliance and goonswarm both have publicly available 30/60 day skill plans to guide starting characters . 
  some ways to get a leg up on skill training using isk are, 
  * attribute implants ( prices have crashed lately ), 
  * flying navy ships instead of tech 2 ships, 
  * using faction modules instead of tech 2, 
  personally , i wouldnt go the faction route on a pvp ship , but i might consider it on a pve ship . 
  maybe bounty is taken from clone cost so it is zero sum . 
  the tears , so glorious . 
  6-man tf2 leagues are a big thing already . 
  some reasons i can think of :, 
  people have stockpiles of minerals from back when tritanium was 2.2 isk/unit, 
  people like building ships because they 're cool , regardless of profit, 
  people who mine their own minerals and consider them to be free, 
  people who have n't switched production when they stopped being profitable, 
  people who are plain bad at math, 
  oh , yeah , if price really is n't an issue , just buy a pre-existing character . 
  test allegedly has a renter system now . 
  feel free to be guinea pigs . 
  well , i know a system in syndicate you could try , but the pve is pretty poor . 
  try venal ? 
  i believe black rebel rifter club does too , although i hope you like rifters . 
  he is entitled to make his own decisions . 
  i can imagine people bumping asteroids around , chased by angry miners , set to benny hill music . 
  not even your alts . 
  ungrateful fuckers ... 
  join flying dangerous in syndicate . 
  missiles are not like guns . 
  range is easy . 
  dps is hard . 
  wow the skill and rig change is a big enough buff to hams . 
  once you have t2 guns , you get access to t2 ammunition . 
  null , barrage and scorch really add a lot of tactical flexibility to a ship . 
  and when we ** do ** fuck around , we do n't fuck around with it . 
  * warhead rigor catalyst, 
  i hope for your sake it 's delayed , or you might find a lot of unexpectedly-well-prepared opponents , 
  theyve been there for a couple months . 
  capital mining barges . 
  the mining equivalent of ratting carriers . 
  not yet . 
  do tell . 
  a guy 's got ta have a hobby ... 
  trading , obviously . 
  gevlon donates 20 billion a month to his favorite alliance from his trading profits , so it 's quite achievable . 
  losing the utility high is a bit rough , but +1 low for a drone amp , and +1 mid for dual prop , dual web or cap booster is pretty handy . 
  edit : or of course shield tanking it for max deeps . 
  why not ? 
  it 's easier not to change it . 
  nice . 
  still , siege mode on a capital mining barge better be freaking awesome to be worth it . 
  +750 % yield or something . 
  maybe its for mining in incursions ... :-), 
  plus you can make cylon jokes every time you fly it . 
  i high value haul in * other * people 's freighters . 
  evegate , 
  omen ( 40m ^ 3 ) = armageddon-like ( 125m ^ 3 ), 
  maller ( 0m ^ 3 ) = abaddon-like ( 75 ^ 3 ), 
  i can see a 20m ^ 3 drone bay being appropriate . 
  i do n't . 
  maybe all the stuff is made from pi ( which makes sense since what else are dusties going to export from a planet ? ), 
  there were a few items that turned up in the sisi database during crucible that support my wild guess :, 
  * [ clones ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=3923&amp;build=sisi ), 
  * [ hardware ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=3922&amp;build=sisi ), 
  20m a day is pretty reasonable for a 2-week old player with probably-meagre funding . 
  i assume you have a trade tool of some description ? 
   if it 's another generic hisec corp that does nothing then i think i know why . 
  train the diplomacy skill , go back to the caldari agents . 
   how do we be ` special ' ?

   hey guys !, 
   so if you do n't know who i am i am the guy that is making this change . 
  just to be clear the dev blog about this can be found over [ here ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;nbid=73413 ) and the feedback thread for it can be found [ here ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;find=unread&amp;t=155690 ) . 
   i have been attempting to follow that feedback thread primarily and i apologize for not reading this thread and commenting on it sooner . 
  i would prefer if you had additional feedback that you posted it in the feedback thread above . 
   now , down to business . 
  i have read a good portion of the thread , if i do n't answer your question directly sorry . 
  i will however try and answer as many questions as possible . 
   i have read a few posts stating that devs do n't play the game , or that we do n't play a specific area of the game such as high sec pve , or null sec pve . 
  i ca n't even begin to tell you how wrong you are . 
  just in the game design department alone we have people who play both of those areas and much more . 
  this is also not a change we just willy nilly said `` well we have nothing else to do so let 's throw darts at a board and pick something random . '', 
  this is a change we really feel is needed and really believe in . 
   as most of this thread is focused on the concerns of drone users let 's start with them . 
  i do n't think i made this entirely clear when i posted the dev blog , but one of the factors that go into an npc picking a target is the sig radius of both the npc and the target . 
  the npc prefer to shoot things matching their own sig radius . 
  this means that if you are in a bs with drones , the cruiser and bs sized npcs will much prefer to target you while the frigates will probably prefer to switch to your drones .
