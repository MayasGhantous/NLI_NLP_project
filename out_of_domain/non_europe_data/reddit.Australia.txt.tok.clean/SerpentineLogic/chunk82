  1 . do all the amarr career agent missions in all three career agent systems, 
  go to the amarr data centres and cash in some tags, 
  go to the * caldari * data centres and cash in some tags, 
  go do the sisters of eve epic mission arc , choosing to ally with amarr where appropriate . 
  you already have the basic combat skills from your career agent training , and probably have good drone skills from mining . 
  ** then ** do missions, 
  depends . 
  if there 's a privacy act violation , he could be up for a fine etc. 
  if it 's just being retarded with credit card numbers , then visa or whoever will cut them off , which will cause them losses but they signed a contract saying they 'd be responsible with cc numbers so tough luck for them . 
  we ca n't get the history of the iraq wars straight and it 's been a * decade * . 
  if you know which bank their merchant account is with , you can ring them up as an employee and ask what the contact details are of their credit card fraud and security department . 
  it 's a legitimate request . 
  also there 's a better-than-even chance that the bank will use [ tns ] ( http://www.tnsi.com/products-services/payments ) to process the actual transactions , so if the bank is being stupid you can go over their heads as a nuclear option . 
  yes , i know , * more * crimewatch analysis , but the comment about how crimewatch 2 could tie into the contraband rules was interesting . 
  tns is the back end of two major credit cards , so its a good bet . 
  and here i am , replying to you just hours after you posted .

    we 've heard there 've been some rough goings-on in orpana - at least one planet having suffered a sudden outbreak of short-lived but heavy combat . 
  of course the guristas extend their deepest sympathies to those innocents dragged into the horrors of war and hope that they can recoup from their losses as quickly and painlessly as possible . 
    in the meantime , though , we intend to pay them a visit . 
  help clean up . 
  remove any detritus , garbage , unsafe technologies and anything else that might be in their way on the battlefield now that all the action is over . 
  we do n't require any thanks for our efforts , only that the local citizenry stay out of the way while we comb through the affected areas and extract anything that might be of use to us . 
  while we certainly do n't wish to add undue harm and suffering to what is already a deeply unpleasant situation for all involved , we would like to note that any opposition , whether on the surface or in planetary orbit , will be met with the requisite force . 
   sounds like the guristas are going to be venturing into the forge soon !, 
  ooc discussion of this goes here . 
  ic discussion on the linked thread . 
  i just chose somewhere deep in gallente space then looked on the route for the first system owned by the gallente federation . 
  also because of [ this devblog ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;nbid=73445 ) , which can be summed up with,

  ccp goliath :, 
   too cryptic , didnt read ? 
  - live events are back, 
   peter powers wrote :, 
    are we talking about an event ,, 
    or is this angel incursions ? 
   not one specific event . 
  a return of events on as regular a basis as we can get , with a team , and a plan . 
  8 days left on that :-p, 
   after some more internal and external play testings , we are fairly happy with existing destroyers , except for the catalyst , as mentioned in the new destroyer balancing thread . 
   we want to increase the fittings on it so it is able to mount neutron blasters , or even have a hope to fit 150mm railguns ( with fitting implants / rigs ) . 
  however , by doing so we are removing its tiny dronebay to make its role more focused on turrets and keep a clear distinction with the new gallente drone destroyer . 
   * powergrid increased from 60 to 70, 
   * cpu increased from 170 to 178, 
   * drone bay and bandwidth removed, 
   doing so approximately keeps the same damage potential as before , except you have slightly more range as using neutrons instead of ions . 
  it also means you do n't have to rely on a destructible damage source ( light drone ) to compensate for your downgraded guns . 
   also , we want to reduce mass on existing destroyers to make them more noticeable against the new hulls . 
  changes are the most important for the ships that needed the most , while the thrasher was slightly tuned down . 
  for instance , we estimate around 200m/s to be gained on mwd speeds for a catalyst . 
   * coercer : mass decreased from 1665000 to 1650000 , agility increased from 2.75 to 2.77 to keep close align time, 
   * cormorant : mass decreased from 1892000 to 1700000 , agility increased from 2.5 to 2.78 to keep close align time, 
   * catalyst : mass decreased from 1761000 to 1550000 , agility increased from 2.45 to 2.76 to keep close align time, 
   * thrasher : mass ** increased ** from 1542000 to 1600000 , agility decreased from 2.96 to 2.8 to keep close align time, 
   we also had a look at the catalyst bonuses , but we find them acceptable as they are right now - swapping turret optimal range to falloff would be detrimental to long range catalyst setups , especially with the fittings changes , that 's why no modifications are planned on that front . 
  much easier to see only the dev posts . 
  faction/corp standings , not sec status . 
  wait , they kicked you when * they * were the ones declaring war ? 
  i dont even, 
  just bear in mind that the good bull bars ( the ones that slope forward towards the top ) are quite illegal in urban areas . 
  the forward slope on the bull bar stops roos and cattle sliding off during a collision , sliding over the bonnet then killing you as it goes through your windscreen . 
  it also makes any impact with a human into a fatality , because it pulps their rib cage , hence the ban . 
  ugg boots were pretty cheap in those days .

  you might want to learn about overview tabs . 
  i was there and the crucible trailer are aimed at existing players , imo . 
  a one-man corp could probably get away with a, 
  * caldari tower ( small ), 
  * 3 x advanced labs, 
  * a bunch of ecm and hardeners anchored but offline, 
  although a 5-lab medium tower allows for a lot more useful stuff to be kept online . 
  not sure whether the australian standard covers them . 
  you just want the engine to get enough air intake to get you across a flooded river , although you better hope youre heavy enough not to float . 
  toyota landcruisers are stupidly heavy so i guess theyre safe . 
  then again , ive never seen a snorkel on a rav 4 or anything light . 
  because people are making [ hundreds of billions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tzrbb.png ) ~ ~ ab ~ ~ using faction warfare complexes . 
  that 's how people got their pax amarrias ... 
  let 's be realistic . 
  they 've been going up [ for weeks ] ( http://jestertrek.com/eve/blog/2012/plex.png ) . 
  it 's surprising what you [ get used to ... ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/its-surprising-what-you-can-get-used-to.html ), 
  ccp periodically has a ~ ~ ` one month for $ 5 ' ~ ~ ` two months for $ 20 ' deal , which usually comes out close to an expansion release . 
  it 's a bit erratic though . 
  however , i think it would be a good idea for ccp to have a year-round deal in place , like the buddy system ( except a lesser reward , because i just know that people will use it to ` help ' their own alt ` return ' ), 
  * edit : * in fact , i think i 'll ping the csm about it . 
  so does the power of 2 deal , but as i implied , plex prices have been on a big upward swing for months . 
  just be quick about it ... 
  yes . 
  it is n't the lp generation so much as the tier 5 cash-out discounts . 
  there 's a few ways to reduce that abuse . 
  i guess the important thing is to weight up the slight loss of income from people getting occasional ' 7 days free ' onto their accounts , vs the new income from legitimate resubscriptions - something only ccp marketing and finance departments can answer .
