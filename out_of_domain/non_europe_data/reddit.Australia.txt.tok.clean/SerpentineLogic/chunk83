  apps that cost isk to buy are also ok, 
  apps that cost rl money need a license that you get by talking to marketing and convincing them to give you one . 
  not sure about apps that are free but have adwords or whatever . 
  some people who would know more are [ raath ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/raath ) or [ blake ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/blakea ) . 
  why not raise a petition or contact ccp ? 
  maybe they 'll give you an [ extension ] ( http://saladsocial.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/shut-up-and-take-my-money11.jpeg ) . 
    what about apps that make money from built-in adverts and such ? 
   not sure about apps that are free but have adwords or whatever . 
   some people who would know more are [ raath ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/raath ) or [ blake ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/blakea ) . 
  i think the point was that ccp was trying to extract revenue from its players by charging app users ( with the idea that a license would then allow them to pass the cost onto users ) . 
  after a while , people managed to convince them that this idea :, 
  1 . would kill off the eve app ecosystem, 
  1 . would cost ccp a lot of goodwill, 
  1 . is the most retarded idea ever, 
  so they decided not to do it . 
  heck , i would n't be surprised if the guy who thought up that idea got laid off after the jita riots . 
  overheats longer than t2 . 
  however , t2 can be manufactured whereas meta modules are random drops and theoretically rarer , except ccp fucked up the loot table . 
  t1 has heatdissipationratemodifier 0.01, 
  t2 has heatdissipationratemodifier 0.02, 
  double-wrapping [ does n't always help ] ( http://alexander.eve-kill.net/index.php?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=14801469 ) , precisely because anything worth double-wrapping is * probably * worth ganking just for curiosity 's sake . 
  ( it was n't in this case , bl guys . ), 
  well , when you see ceos of nullsec alliances [ recruiting on botting forums ] ( http://nosygamer.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/ccps-war-on-bots-accountability.html ) , you got ta take it up a notch . 
  yes . 
  if your boss * hired * you specifically to kill people , then yes , he should . 
  large < type  turret v,

  conveniently , shredded paper burns really well . 
  en24 published the pages . 
  tm did not . 
  guess what people will post links to ? 
  like a boss . 
  if china jumped off a cliff , would you do it too ? 
  import four types of p1 , export 500 p3 per day .

   currently the person we are using the bpo 's from would really like to receive 50 % of the profit if it is done using their bpo . 
  jesus christ that 's a lot . 
  that 50 % would be better spent being saved up to buy the bpo off them . 
  sometimes rigs are worth max-run just to benefit from the extra runs of a decryptor that you were really mostly using to cut build costs with . 
  choose a shuttle type and stick with it , imo . 
  i think i have a few shuttle bpos scattered around the place . 
  it seems that whenever i move to a new lowsec staging system , i ship in some tritanium and a bpo and crank out shuttles at inflated prices to sell to people whose ships were destroyed . 
  if you, 
  have production efficiency v for no manufacturing lossage, 
  research the bpo sufficiently ( me10 pe10 will take you a couple weeks to research , but me20 would be better ), 
  1 . run that bpo full-steam, 
  1 . transport those shuttles to market, 
  1 . sell all the shuttles that you make, 
  assuming tritanium is 6.01 isk/unit , you 're looking at a profit of 9200 isk per shuttle , or about 600k isk/day . 
  you 'll have to decide whether that 's worth it for you . 
  personally , i 'd rather sell fewer shuttles with higher margins and less competition , by carpet bombing a low-sec constellation . 
  i suggest you check out eveiskperhour . 
  i 'd demand the tip back . 
  shuttles align faster and have a much higher velocity than noob ships . 
  me too . 
  in fact , a few guys from [ soa ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/sons_of_alexander ) and related corps live here . 
  yes ; 6au/s vs 3au/s, 
  i saw a cassowary in a zoo when i was seven . 
  it looked like big bird on pcp , crossed with a dinosaur , and the massive dents in the steel plating and weldmesh enclosure spoke eloquently of its malevolent demeanour . 
  so how come you 're writing your own instead of leveraging drk or aideron code ? 
   as for drk , i am not familiar . 
  sounds reasonable . 
  evemail [ selucid ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/selucid ) and we can get something organised . 
  well , [ emg ] ( http://www.eve-market-guide.com/invention.php ) does the first bit ; not sure what 's out there for the historical stuff , but [ blake ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/blakea ) has something cooking already . 
   but to answer your question , yes , having bc v now will give you all racial bc skills at v when the changes happen . 
  weeeeeeeeeell , you 'll probably also need racial cruiser iii to get each of the racial battlecruiser skills . 
  it scales up as you play . 
  when you 're new , you have 4-day trains like drones v. 
  when you 're a bit older , it 's 16-day trains like racial cruiser v. 
  when you 're a bit older than that , it 's 40-day trains like racial dreadnaught v , by which time you 're just glad you do n't have to login until next month . 
  depending how he 's remapped , a rank 5 + skill that he 's mapped away from might last that long . 
  you 're not looking hard enough . 
  i 've spent time in providence , venal and syndicate and never had problems carving out a niche in my timezone . 
  you just have to pick your constellation . 
  also , when you 're spacerich from trading , you can sponsor killboard competitions , handing out free ships , implants and modules for top killers . 
  nope . 
  t1 ships require racial ship skills . 
  t2 ships require one racial and one t2 ship skill . 
  go to lowsec , arrange standings for low taxes . 
  never underestimate the free rifters program ... 
  it was an unprepared speech , so it was all her . 
  i do n't recommend manufacturing , since it ties you down to a location , which is a pain for a pvp character . 
  if your pvp character gets into heavy interdictors , you 'll end up with science v and some graviton physics skills anyway . 
  you could then use those skills ( plus lab operation ) to do some r&d work . 
  the good thing about research is that you can do short-time jobs like inventing covops cloaks , or long-running jobs like month-long capital ship bpo me research . 
  this is much more suited to a character who might be in hunting in enemy held space for a while . 
  another thing that might work is planetary management , since it can be done from anywhere , and your pvp character is much more likely to be in nullsec where the pi is better . 
  the only problem is that eventually you have to empty those spaceports , so your pvp character will probably be hauling huge amounts of pi in a mammoth . 
  i 'm fairly certain that arterial pressure would be a problem . 
  because good cars do n't need decals . 
  the standard caldari missile boat progression seems to be, 
  ( new caldari missile destroyer ), 
  caracal, 
  drake, 
  1 . either tengu then stop , or raven -  raven navy issue -  golem, 
  the caldari hybrid line is a bit anemic towards the end :, 
  merlin, 
  ferox , which is a bit meh, 
  rohk , which is a bit meh for pve, 
  no idea , probably an incursion-running vindicator,
