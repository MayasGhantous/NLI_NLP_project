  not sure why this is being downvoted . 
  its a thought provoking article with fairly well thought out arguments , and is n't a picture of someones latest graphics glitch . 
  you must be new here ( to life ), 
   something i 've heard about , though , are refinery planets , where , paraphrasing something i 've read , `` you bring p1 material and turn it into p4 material '' ... or something . 
  i have no idea what that means . 
  i 've also heard around 100m is good capital to start that endeavor with . 
  could someone explain more to me about that ? 
  [ i used to do that ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/highsec-planetary-manufacturing/ ) ( in highsec ) before i moved it to lowsec . 
  usually you use two nanos to increase your agility ( you do n't want i-stabs because the whole point is to go fast while maintaining a small signature radius ), 
  generally the best ships to use it on are those who do n't care about transversal , such as tengus . 
   but if you have no cap it might as well not be on, 
  it 's not * terrible * . 
  * em ward amplifier : 37.5 % -46.88 % based on em compensation skill, 
  * em ward field ( off ) : 0 % -15 % based on em compensation skill, 
  15 % is not bad - it 's more than a damage control , and half of a tech 2 invuln . 
   em ward field ( ** off ** ), 
  obviously , it 's 55 % when turned on . 
  someone bubbles * you * and you 're totally fucked . 
  so does losing a hic because you did n't have a propulsion mod . 
  `` the nuns of gavarone '', 
  usually such alliances migrate to npc nullsec , where they can use bubbles . 
  you can get an all level iv tank in less than six months . 
  its the gunnery and spaceship skills that take the whole year ... 
  train hams , keep tengu . 
  or train torps , manticore and raven in anticipation of tracking enhancer missile buff . 
  we can play the yomi layer game * all day . 
  which time zone ? 
  if you 're interested in manufacture and research , my [ alt corp is hiring ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/10lqzn/setenta_corp_is_hiring_builders_scientists/ ) . 
  `` i 've upped my standards . 
  up yours '' . 
  i like seven core probes and one deep space probe , myself . 
  you forgot to blur out the y-m in the chat window . 
  aideron robotics is a gallente training corp , if youre interested in joining or allying with them . 
  it seemed a shame to spoil the rest of the blurring out you did ... 
  tried checking out the sisi branch from svn ? 
  are you using scripts on your tracking disruptor ? 
  economic warfare is a legitimate technique . 
  there 's also / r/evenewbies for the really noob questions you have, 
  i believe eve university has a channel you can ask questions in , as well . 
  once or twice , i even asked for help in local chat , especially when doing the sisters of eve epic mission arc . 
  two noobs in destroyers owned a boss that i could n't kill alone . 
  message sent . 
  i was under the impression t1 logi cruisers were also getting buffed this expansion . 
  i think you need it to use deep space probes anyway . 
  ah , so that 's how you work around the fact that the api does n't provide me/pe/runs of inactive blueprints . 
  nice .

  shield megas are [ viable ] ( http://incursions.nexsoft.de/?mode=dps&amp;s=megathron ) , but a navy mega or vindi is preferable . 
  makes sense . 
  it 's not halliburton 's oil ; it 's the usa 's . 
  bloods are fairly weak vs thermal damage anyway . 
  sadly , the days of the cavalry raven are long gone . 
  til lord of war was produced by the guy who made the wing commander computer games . 
  \\* cough \\* drones \\* cough \\*, 
   the cia normally works through proxies anyway, 
  the typical number is nine proxies . 
  interacting with the game via the in-game browser + javascript is ok though . 
  eve-central and eve-marketeer use it to bring up the market windows of stuff they want you to look at , so it will eventually turn up in your cache and update their records . 
  drones are n't worth remapping for , imo . 
  the mem/per split means that if your current map is per/will or int/mem , it will be similar speed , and in any case it will be above baseline . 
  suck it up . 
  which makes sense , since there 's only ~ 300k people in the entire country . 
  still marginal if you already have remapped . 
  i learned most of my astronomy knowledge from star control ii , vov . 
  you want [ chruker 's ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/market.php ) page . 
  hope not . 
  people without eyebrows ~ ~ are ~ ~ look weird . 
  i hope you 'll be keeping the hair - hair that long can be collected and made into wigs for cancer sufferers .

  most drone-related modules already have federation navy versions . 
   the last big thing i remember was some shenanigans with somebody infiltrating bob and breaking them up in one night . 
  re stain : you can ask a gm to move the * ship you 're currently in * to empire when you resub , and they 'll usually comply . 
  however , convincing them to move all the other stuff in your hangar is more dicey - you might have to get the black frog guys to move it for you . 
  alternatively , just check eve-central for a ballpark figure and sell your stuff on public contract . 
  re news : we tend to read themittani.com or evenews24.com , or go to the source on kugutsumen.com if you can stand it . 
  tmdc has some good articles detailing the fall of bob , rise and fall of it and the rise and fall and rise of goonswarm in its archives . 
  re what expansions happened since you left : how convenient for you that i have [ a post for that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/tdu9q/returning_to_eve_advice/c4ls5xh ) . 
  as far as i 'm aware , drone damage amplifier ii is +19 % , so getting +24 % is a ** big deal ** . 
  because purple . 
  and , perhaps one day , high-slot target painters . 
  one imagines thats what unified inventory is meant to do . 
  too much alpha with light missiles . 
  if you dont station trade , why are you so concerned with a quick sale ? 
  that.may be the point . 
  its not designed to be a corp hangar any more ; its now a fleet hangar for use on an op . 
  ironically , this is what the nullsec anomaly nerf was supposed to do : make some systems not worth taking by the big guys and leaving it to the up and coming groups . 
  of course , they forgot about supercaps ... 
  it was good . 
  not too technical , focused on the.human side . 
  good approach . 
  the human side makes for better stories . 
  try c0nvicted . 
  ineluctable is decently skilled . 
  damned nation is just a lot bigger . 
  a dual rep incursus would work . 
  ( assuming you even have the necessary corp roles to deploy a tower ), 
  sure . 
  i did it myself for a month or two , before the effort of logging in became too great . 
  the main hassle is getting the fuel in and the goo out . 
  aim to login every week or so .
