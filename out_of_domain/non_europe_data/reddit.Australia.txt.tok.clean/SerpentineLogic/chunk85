  it helps to put in exactly enough fuel so that the tower runs out of fuel just when the silo fills up , so your in-game calendar keeps track for you . 
  obviously , put a corporate hangar bay in the pos so you can store fuel and moon goo ( within 2500m of the tower and the silo ) . 
  that way , if you 're pressed for time , just fly to the tower , offline silo , drag to hangar , online silo , drag fuel to tower , then off to the next tower . 
  this is ameliorated somewhat if you have a station in the system , but such systems are not as quiet . 
  depends on the raw material i guess . 
  realistically , anything r8 or lower is n't worth putting up a tower for ( if you were going to put up a tower * anyway * , then any goo you mine is gravy ) . 
  do your sums . 
  generally , unless you 're mining something nice like neo or plat , you 'll need to consider sucking it up and reacting up to complex , just to ensure that your stuff is saleable . 
  i sat on a stock of vanadium for months because the price crashed below fuel costs and i was n't willing to take a loss on it ( i had already taken the towers down by then ), 
  they used to be significantly cheaper , but ccp added a bunch of missions so the particular one that drops that implant ( or indeed any of the mindlinks ) shows up much less often . 
  everything since the myrmidon has been more crystalline carbonide , less organotech . 
  perhaps the jove influence is fading , 
   so you use the price of selling your moon goo to buy fuel ? 
  well , yeah . 
  if the moon goo sells for less than than the fuel it takes to mine it , you 're just wasting money and should seriously consider tearing down the tower . 
   you do n't mine it yourself ? 
  i could , but that 's immaterial . 
  if i made fuel blocks from ice , i still have the option of, 
  ( a ) load them into a pos to get moon goo , or, 
  ( b ) just sell the fuel blocks and get money . 
  at any time , one choice is right , and one of them is wrong , based on whichever one makes the most profit .

  getup is a progressive organisation ( i.e.

  here 's [ a thing i wrote ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/fitting-a-tengu/ ) a while back . 
  it 'll probably change a fair bit when retribution hits and raivi 's changes go in . 
  100nm fist bump, 
  jester 's opinion is ' [ meh , little change ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/projectionist.html ) ' . 
  gallente ships are usually green . 
  amarr ships are usually yellow . 
  any ship you target will have a corresponding background color based on its race . 
  ships from the same racial line usually have similar characteristics ( fast vs slow , strong armor vs strong shields etc ), 
  while your condor may have two high slots , it may not have two * turret * slots . 
  the other slot may only be able to fit a launcher ( or in some cases , ca n't fit a gun or a launcher and can only be fit with a utility module ), 
  you 're two days in . 
  assume that any ship you encounter in low-sec will be piloted by someone who knows what they 're doing . 
  if you enlist in faction war , you can fleet up with others which lets you engage in combat without immediately dying . 
  i suggest you enlist if that interests you . 
  let me dredge up some links for you :,
