  he puts the wubwub into the eve trailers . 
  torps are best for all stealth bombers , although if you 're bomb fit , the dps from torps is not as important . 
  well done ; jolly good show , wot . 
  teadaze neglects to mention that the 75 % discount at tier 5 cash out makes ita lot smaller sink than youd expect . 
  crushing on / u/parasoja in an internet-spaceship-manufacturing way . 
  he 's ccp 's mascot . 
  as a transitional measure , you might like to investigate the corps in [ project halibut ] ( http://projecthalibut.org/about/ ) . 
  he might end up director in charge of the dust division , 
  in that case , your ship progression will be, 
  * merlin, 
  * ferox ( medium guns , big tank ), 
  * naga ( large guns , weak tank ), 
  * rokh ( large guns , big tank ), 
  strategic cruisers change shape depending on the combination of subsystems they have fitted to them . 
  eve uni wiki has a [ writeup on the ` cane ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/hurricane ) , which includes recommended skills . 
  just bear in mind that you might have to drop the second medium neut if your skills are n't awesome ( or after retribution , when it wo n't fit without a power grid rig ), 
  also , i have no idea why they suggest you train targeting v . you can safely shelve that . 
  core targeting certificate strikes again . 
  ccp devs develop it on pc . 
  its definitely possible to release it on pc eventually . 
  just put a multi day skill at the end ofthe queue . 
  navy apocs see a lot of use in fleets atm . 
  and yet dust skills train differently to eve ... 
  cant we have both ? 
  fozzie has done something like 40 ships since he was hired . 
  i dont think it will take long to rebalance all of them . 
  i get that faction warfare would benefit from unique stuff , but taking it away from all other corps you can get lp with sounds a bit over the top . 
  that cuts both ways . 
  id like to see each type of corp have a semi unique subset of items in their faction store , and my inclination is that combat related corps should not be the ones with access to attribute implants . 
  remember that there are entire classes that dont need more than the smallest changes . 
  add a bit more fitting to the nemesis and all the stealth bombers are done . 
  similarly for freighters etc. 
  * specialization, 
  * [ fleets ] ( http://www.endie.net/wordpress/?p=42 ), 
  * [ community ] ( http://www.endie.net/wordpress/?p=52 ), 
  * [ the big story ] ( http://www.endie.net/wordpress/?p=58 ), 
  also theres android and iphone apps that do that . 
  perhaps shes paying it forward . 
  exploration of combat sites , moving up to day tripping into wormholes you find . 
  if you like it , you can apply to a w space corp and do it full time . 
  i think lockefox is building something like that , or at least working with raath to expand the drk app . 
  thats why you disable the ui before taking screenshots . 
  noir still does that when they have a contract . 
  a while back , benghazi was the city that gaddafi was about to raze to the ground because it was a hotbed of resistance . 
  that point was when the usa got involved ( un no fly zones do n't work when they attack on the ground ) so it makes sense to have an outpost there . 
  one would think that they would defend it better , but that 's a separate issue . 
  best freighter is minmatar because it 's a lot faster to align and autopilot with . 
  to be honest it 's a rare occasion that the racial cargo difference matters . 
  or have sufficient base scan strength that signatures filter away faster . 
   and range decreased from obscene 120km to 95km, 
  it 's more like [ 46km with fury ] ( http://eve-search.com/thread/155029-1/author/ccp#45 ) , btw . 
  seconding the know your enemy article series . 
  reading them is a great way to learn what the various ship types do . 
   it 's become ritual for me to fly a ** 100k ** + isk ship into the front lines, 
  too easy . 
  if you engage something in a taranis , you know that * someone * 's going home in a pod .

   you ca n't deduct the cost of raising a child from a national cost . 
  i suppose you , too , are an economist ? 
  tbh , buy a game time card and sell the plex for isk . 
  you can live off the proceeds for months , by which time you 'll have higher skill points and a better idea about how to get that isk back to buy them back . 
  perhaps you should install a better keyboard app ... 
  swiftkey is pretty good . 
  my flatmate at university was from singapore . 
  she used to drink a lot of chocolate milk , but never twigged that maybe it was the reason for her stomach pains . 
  singapore is a [ * fine * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fine_%28penalty%29 ) city . 
  i believe you mean `` because of verone '', 
  perhaps your faction warfare cashout macro was still on . 
  [ source ] ( http://johnquiggin.com/2012/10/19/statistical-significance/ ) . 
  east khanid trading is an amarr missionrunning corp. . perhaps join them for a month or two . 
  gallente towers are bonused for moon mining , so unless you 're doing that , or for some reason you prefer to use gallente fuel blocks for logistical reasons , then it 's prudent to choose something else . 
  do you really , * really * want to pay hundreds of millions of isk per month in fuel just for manufacturing slots ? 
  more to the point , are you going to run them all at the same time ? 
  unless you are , just anchor what you want then online just what you need at that point . 
  that allows you to keep a lot more useful stuff online . 
  there 's * two of * you . 
  realistically , you 're not going to be able to defend a pos , so guns are n't going to do much . 
  probably better to put up a medium caldari tower and online a couple of each type of ecm as discouragement instead . 
  it wo n't help vs sieged dreads but then again nothing you have will . 
  so , a set up like this would work :, 
  * caldari control tower medium, 
  * corp hangar array, 
  * 8 ecm of various flavors, 
  * 5 hardeners ( 2 em , 2 expl , 1 kin ) , at least 2 of them online ( to cover the em and explosive resist holes ), 
  * 3 + advanced labs for your r & d work, 
  * enough cpu and power grid for one or two assembly arrays . 
  * extra modules to taste, 
  not that i 'm doubting you ( \\* ) , but i 'll wait for another primary source than fox news before i react . 
  \\* i am, 
  caldari towers have a bonus to ecm : it works 4 times as fast , hence the reason you 'd online a bunch of ecm batteries on the tower . 
  the hardeners are to increase the shield resistances . 
  each tower type has some resistance vs a certain demage type , but the other resists will be 0 . 
  generally you run up to 7 hardeners ( some of which are offline until attacked ) but you can get away with 3 .
