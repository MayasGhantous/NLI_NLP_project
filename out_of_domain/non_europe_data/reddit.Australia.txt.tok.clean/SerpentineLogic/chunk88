  you pass . 
  why would i be even looking for bookmarks of providence when i am in jita ? 
  do you have osx 10.6.3 ? 
  tried re-downloading it ? 
  tried [ this ] ( http://naumanlodhi.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/fix-mac-error-code-36.html ) ? 
  sounds like a permissions issue . 
  were many of them running under a windows emulator ? 
  ha , my mate just bought a second biltong box to keep up up with demand from friends . 
  it 's just the [ nature of the game ] ( http://v.cdn.cad-comic.com/comics/cad-20120625-8bb4c.png ) . 
  also known as the ` come at me bro ' award . 
  in rvb , overheat everything as soon as you undock . 
  trial accounts ca n't use the contract system . 
  i dont think you can have two trial accounts logged in at once from the same computer . 
  frodo and sam, 
  at planet three, 
  r-e-p-p-i-n-g . 
  for one-offs , just cut and paste into [ here ] ( http://industry.darkshadowindustries.com/pricecheck ) from your eve client . 
  if it was a pvp engagement , zero chance . 
  if it was a pve engagement , maybe , the first time , if you 're lucky . 
  i like [ this plan ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/nullsec-noob-training-plan/ ) ; there are many other ways to progress though . 
  choose the race you want to play . 
  you probably have good missile skills so a medium-term goal of a drake and a manticore is a good idea . 
  alternatively if you have gunnery skills then a harpy , naga and rohk might be a good bet . 
  in any case , training for interceptors is a good idea , since nobody really picks them for their uber damage output . 
  generally you downship to something slightly better than what you 're trying to kill . 
  i would n't try to kill a cormorant in a drake unless i had no choice ( or were flying a dual web fit ) - a kill of a t1 frigate is n't worth the risk of losing a drake , even if you had a magical 90 % kill rate . 
  some good examples of ships you 'd try to kill a condor with would be ( in increasing order of cost ), 
  * kestrel ( missiles ) or merlin ( guns ), 
  * a corax ( missiles ) or cormorant ( guns ) destroyer, 
  * a caracal cruiser ( rapid light missiles ) or moa ( guns ) , preferably with a stasis webifier . 
  * caldari navy hookbill or an assault frigate if you like to splurge . 
  never not fly something something something . 
  an example of a rental agreement can be found here . 
  not that i recommend them . 
  suggestion : ecm does n't break locks , but any module you were using on another ship gets +20 s cooldown . 
  assuming not trolling :, 
  * get refining skills up , plus high standings with the corp who owns the station you refine at, 
  * get in fleet for mining foreman bonuses, 
  * make sure that crystals are available in your corp hangar . 
  i love downtime faction spawn hunting though . 
  i did that months ago . 
  i got tired of reposting it . 
  before you start , you might want to read isk : the guide as well . 
  most capital modules and components are bigger than the minerals used to make them . 
  also , most small ships . 
  you missed the one that happened yesterday ... 
  it is . 
  that makes sense . 
  everything in eve can be explained by either, 
  * nanites , or, 
  * [ to every eve newbie : 9 things to know about eve before you jump in ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/uptqq/to_every_eve_newbie_9_things_to_know_about_eve/ ), 
  * [ isk : the guide ] ( http://isktheguide.com/ ), 
  * [ eve university wiki ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/getting_started_in_eve_online ), 
  * [ some more advanced guides ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/qsa2j/newb_here_need_a_guide_or_something_to_start_me/c402d46 ), 
  do you have assets you can sell ? 
  mineral prices have doubled in the past ~ 12 months , due to the almost-total removal of mineral drops from drones and loot . 
  alternatively , have you considered selling your alt character ? 
  unfortunately so . 
  mice do n't have as many cancer preventing processes as humans ( they rarely live long enough for cancer to be an issue ) , so almost every time that someone ` cures cancer in mice ' , it turns out that they 've found another technique that 's * already * being used by the human body . 
  emma thompson chasing him around naked certainly did n't help . 
  iceland had a different ' [ situation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81standi%c3%b0 ) ' ... 
  yes . 
  you really need to compare the build costs between tranquillity and test server to see what the new price will be , if you want to get into the patch speculation game . 
  id shore up your support and navigation skills then remap max perception/rest willpower for a year or so . 
  battle cruiser skill , pvp and blasters ? 
  ask yourself if you regularly fly with 255 of your closest friends . 
  i suggest you look about for a w-space corp , but until you find a match , you can get a lot of experience by basing yourself in highsec then day-tripping into wormholes you scan down . 
  ccp is n't telling , but if i had to guess , these will be available in lp stores . 
   lurk in their public channel, 
  preferably in a cloaky proteus . 
  just have them on the same account - after you get production efficiency v and a few levels in mass production , you can switch training to your pvp character until you need more skills . 
  any will be fine , but you may find that minmatar industrial ships and freighters are the direction you 'll want to skill up for . 
  * the mammoth is most skillpoint-efficient industrial ship ( only requires minmatar industrial iv , and is second-best ship of its class ), 
  * the fenrir is the fastest and most agile freighter ( about 10 % less cargo space , but +20 % faster ) which adds up to a lot faster deliveries, 
  that 's * still * a lot better than the us . 
  never underestimate the scrutiny of thirty pensioners with literally nothing better to do than watch votes being counted . 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  ten times the number of votes ? 
  just get ten times the number of vote counters . 
  after all , you probably have ten times the population as well . 
  counting votes scales really , really well . 
  phew , good thing it 's impossible to mass-produce small white stones . 
  sadly , the las vegas slot machines have more rigorous code control than voting machines . 
  after all , it 's only * votes * . 
  too hard to explain , makes him look like he 's giving lame excuses . 
  with the expansion packs ` the majesta incident ' , ` morsus mihi campaign ' and ` the razor gambit ', 
  nice . 
  then you might like to view a [ video ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/stay-frosty-stealth-bomber-pvp/ ) of solo stealth bomber pvp . 
  if you have a tanky transport ship you wo n't need an orca , imo , especially since the fleet holds will be scannable soon . 
  similarly for the rorqual , which you 'd only get if you went down the orca track ( instead of the jump freighter track ), 
  i think you 're ridiculously overtanked for serpentis 10/10 plexes ( you have pitiful em resists so it ca n't be anything else ), 
  take off the thermal hardener . 
  you 're just embarrassing yourself . 
  capacitor control circuits on a non-lsb fit ? 
  what a waste . 
  use dual deadspace ssbs and fit rigors and dps rigs instead . 
  did you expect us to be impressed or something ? 
  join faction warfare , repair your pvp stats . 
  remember that number of engagements is more important than win percentage , at least for the first few hundred fights . 
  snipe bombers are pretty rare these days , since tier 3 battlecruisers were released .
