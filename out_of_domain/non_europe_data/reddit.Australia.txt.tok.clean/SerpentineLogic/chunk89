  come next year , everything except shield ... 
  name all his ships ` free candy ', 
  its more about the.misleading info than the hate . 
  although that didnt help . 
  * too much clicking ( a hell of a lot to set up , but after that you can get by with a few double-clicks and pressing enter ), 
  * not much actually happens ( silos fill up , you use a spaceport to ship it to space , then pick it up ) . 
  pi was touted as ` simcity in space ' but it 's nowhere near as much fun as that . 
  basically , once you set up your factories , you do n't have to do any real management of it , except occasionally tearing the entire thing down and setting up the exact same infrastructure on the other side of the planet , as you chase the best resources . 
  * not very profitable in highsec ( only a gripe for those who are still in highsec . 
  consider it a trade-off for being able to park your hauler outside a customs office without wondering how many seconds you have before being jumped on ), 
  * no support for corporations . 
  you ca n't route your stuff to corpmates ' installations ; you ca n't set up contracts from customs offices , you ca n't even transfer stuff in customs offices to corpmates without dumping it in a jetcan when you 're both online at the same time . 
  it 's very limited in that regard , when it * should be * easy to make elaborate corp-wide industrial networks . 
  * ties you to a location . 
  you can reset extraction heads from anywhere , but you ca n't launch material unless you 're undocked in-system . 
  this may be a design issue , but it 's still a hassle . 
  the best bit about elaborate corporation-wide planetary industrial networks is sending in dust bunnies to blow them up . 
  no you 're thinking about europeans from the 1780 's . 
  depends on the [ weather ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/wormhole_environment_effects ) . 
  obviously if your home system is a pulsar , you 'd shield tank it like a boss . 
  generally , though , an escalation group looks a lot like [ these guys ] ( http://www.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=15040078 ) . 
  talkingpointmemo is ok . 
   profits will go down, 
  only if you assume that demand does n't go way , way up . 
   seriously though it would be one of the coolest features to fix . 
  sit a dev down and make him play the original outpost game and then tell him to recreate that . 
  let me have to deal with the needs of people in my colony , housing/entertainment/health / food/water . 
  reward me for treating my colonist different ways either like minmatar slaves or gallente equals . 
  this would be an awesome part of eve , and i 'm sad that pi has had so little expansion since its release . 
  bipartisanship in action ? 
  you must be new to the eve forums ... 
  what is the key selling point of your corp that differentiates it from every other tiny corp in eve ? 
  nah selling it is overkill . 
  just buy a dominix or ishtar and use that until the command ships rebalance . 
  tbh that does n't sound like a compelling value proposition . 
  `` we 're chill if you need time away from game . 
  just like every other corporation . '',

  relevant bits :, 
  [ * ] afterburner, 
  [ + | y ] fuelconservationcapneedbonuspostpercentcapacitorneedlocationshipmodulesrequiringafterburner, 
  faster cycling , less cap ? 
  perhaps i 'm not reading it right . 
  [ + ] gravimetric sensor compensation, 
  [ + | n ] sensorcompensationsensorstrengthbonusgravimetric, 
  [ + ] capacity : 0, 
  [ + ] mass : 0, 
  [ + ] primaryattribute : 165.0, 
  [ + ] requiredskill1 : 3426.0 ( electronics ), 
  [ + ] requiredskill1level : 4.0, 
  [ + ] secondaryattribute : 166.0, 
  [ + ] skilllevel : 0, 
  [ + ] volume : 0.01, 
  the faster cycling offsets the decreased cap cost though . 
  at skill v , old bonus : +50 % duration = -33 % cap per second, 
  at skill v , new bonus : -50 % cap activation * -25 % duration = -33 % cap per second, 
  ice mining requires you to login . 
  ca n't have that ... 
  you activate mjd , wait 9 to 12 seconds . 
  while it spools up , only scrams can stop it . 
  not points , not bubbles . 
  when it activates , you blink 100km ahead and retain full speed and alignment . 
  cooldown is 5 minutes . 
  ofc now afterburners gain as much heat as mwds , due to shorter cycle time , so that 's another thing to watch . 
  allows you to, 
  * need less micro, 
  * take off a salvager for another tractor or a cloak, 
  it has been asked a number of times before , but apparently the contract delivery code does n't handle destinations like customs offices , which are size-constrained and not yet autopilotable to . 
  because shield tanks ? 
  indeed it has . 
  heat is generated each cycle . 
  that 's why people are careful with rof rigs on ships , since it increases your dps but can cause you to burn out faster . 
  i belt rat in a pvp fit talos . 
  you only need to tank three battleships , so you do n't need to do anything special .
