   yeah , but i 'd sell my soul to be able to pay even just 1000 a year for my insurance . 
  in australia , that 's [ quite achievable ] ( http://www.medibank.com.au/healthcover/insurance/hospital-range/ ) . 
  even if you do n't pay , you get basic healthcare . 
  i guess the government likes you to be well enough to hold down a job and pay taxes . 
  yeah , but canada is a first-world country . 
  five ballistic control systems ? 
  i think it 's incredible that ~ 30 % of all bankruptcies in the usa are due to medical bills . 
  in contrast , the rest of the world hovers around 3 % . 
  so , literal internet spaceship groupies . 
  some additional alternatives :, 
  * damage control, 
  * nano, 
  * signal amp for scan res, 
  * cap power relay , for potentially freeing up a midslot for a painter, 
  either of which would be better than , what 4 extra dps ? 
  pbu is key for pvp buffer fits, 
  or if the rumours about atlas supercap producers is true , sell your alliance out to save their skin . 
  you must be new to eve . 
  we prefer to call it ` society ' . 
  aside from gallente , all the tier 1 battlecruisers are tank and tier 2 battlecruisers are gank ( come to think of it , the tier 3 battlecruisers are extra-ganky ), 
  except for the drake , which is stupidly tanked and still does not-terrible damage . 
  this change to two missile bonuses will make it more like a mini-raven . 
  this is a sensible progression . 
  ** edit : ** rephrased :, 
  * amarr : tier 1 tank , tier 2 gank, 
  * caldari : tier 1 tank ( !, 
  ) , tier 2 tank, 
  * gallente : tier 1 gank , tier 2 tank, 
  or 30 seconds of drunken rolling . 
  i 'd be okay with them removing the ability to normal-click that overheat button , so i do n't accidentally overheat via a single misclick when i really , ** really ** wanted that module to activate . 
  generally , the idea is to be ceo of a mission/incursion corp rather than a mining corp. 
  that way , you get passive income from corp taxes . 
  australia does . 
  we make sure to use your planes and tanks tho . 
  your war ; your tab . 
  that [ happens ] ( http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;adjacent&amp;kll_id=12024264 ) . 
  did it neut the [ heck ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2012/01/fotw-talisman-bhaalgorn.html ) out of you ? 
   rail naga best rokh, 
  ftfy . 
  `` the future is already here -- it 's just not very evenly distributed . '', 
  -- william gibson, 
  that 's how * disney * works . 
  people need the tags for cn ballistic control systems , so the price ca n't drop much before it 's just not worth doing . 
  supply will dry up , rather than the price tanking . 
  these i-fields will be better than cn , so it 's likely that they will tank the price of the officer modules they compete with rather than the ( relatively ) cheaper faction one . 
  what * could * put downward pressure on the price of cnifs would be republic fleet ifs , since people who want one could choose whichever faction had the cheapest tags . 
  dust-eve link is looking like the same kinds of evasiveness that ccp was giving out when we were asking about incarna establishments ... 
  i think it 's more about buying time until they get a plan together that is n't terrible . 
  blame incursions . 
  more lp and isk floating around , ~ ~ same ~ ~ fewer tags -  invuln prices rise, 
  perhaps ouch or agony empire might be better for you . 
  after all , you 're not a noob ; just a noob to ( small ) fleet warfare . 
  i do . 
  its about 50 mill/day on good days . 
  you only need about 250,000 skill points in pi to make isk in empire , but best done on an alt since it ties you to a location , even if that location is convenient lkke ) erimeter planet 1 . 
  btw in nullsec , you need 800k skillpoints in pi to make isk , but with less hassle . 
  decent film . 
  sometimes i wish they 'd make some sequels . 
  every few days , or once a week : haul stuff to/from market hub , dump into poco . 
  time taken is variable . 
  i often use courier contracts so i only have to get it into the pocos . 
  every 2 days or so : undock , import/export remotely , continue playing . 
  5 minutes or so . 
  i was listening to the eve soundtrack 6 months before i took the plunge and subscribed ... 
  do some probing while you 're there . 
  i used to make a fair bit of isk as a newbie , scanning down low sec radar sites and running them in a battlecruiser for a quick 20m . 
  afterburning af are decent , but mwd af i.e. 
  nullsec af just dont work . 
  they get popped by bigger stuff on approach . 
  adding tank makes ab af too tough , so a role bonus to shave off some of the sig bloom means mwd af can take a few hits as they engage but not be op when they get there . 
  they tried that . 
  bonused ab af were basically unkillable . 
  neut resistance ? 
  it 's called using the utility high for a small nos . 
  web resistance ? 
  unbalances frigate combat too greatly . 
  too many small ships that you * must * clear away before you can hack each can . 
  talk to prometheus exenthal - he was the pvp expert that suggested the mwd change . 
  on isk costs its a fair trade . 
  on ease of replacement , dreads win out , since they cook faster and can be built in lowsec from minerals readily available in jita . 
  you can buy a proper paper copy on their site . 
  it comes with various freebies iirc . 
  evemail him :p, 
  cellists are used to being the butt of jokes . 
  so would drummers , if the jokes did n't go over their heads . 
  [ http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/war_declaration] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/war_declaration ), 
  big up for all the people using eve central uploader . 
  ( new version [ out now ] ( http://yannramin.com/2012/01/20/contribtastic-2-1-1/ ) btw ), 
  yes . 
  with decent skills , you can cap them out 30 % faster than the cap you use to activate the neuts . 
  in addition , you 've probably planned for being low on cap , having fit shield extenders or armour plates instead of repairers . 
  once they ca n't activate a repairer or keep their propulsion or resistance modules active , the hp you have to chew through drops dramatically . 
  probably meant eve-metrics . 
  the joke is that * both * instruments deserve to be thrown into a fire . 
  are you a drummer , by chance ? 
  still no os x package :(, 
  oh , the westerners on that server make a fair bit of t2 ... 
  seriously needs a tldr ;, 
  i would n't read a crikey or stump article that long , let alone reddit . 
  it can take up to 24 hours for everyone 's client to pull down the updated portrait .
