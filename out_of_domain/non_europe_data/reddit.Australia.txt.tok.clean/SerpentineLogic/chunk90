  yes . 
  damps should break locks . 
  ecm should turn off modules and add cooldown . 
  those turned up in a previous patch . 
  i dont want to see ads in this subreddit . 
  has rough edges , but i like the idea . 
  just bear in mind that goonswarm is not known for doing what other people pay it to do . 
  it 's considerably more independent of thought .

  george takei was in macgyver . 
  read up on eve politics to get the big picture , drill down to corp level based on that . 
  it 's not unhelpful at all . 
  curse : popular -  high demand -  people increase supply to meet demand -  competition makes it a high-volume , low-margin market . 
  pilgrim : unpopular -  low demand -  people dial down supply because stock does n't sell -  low-volume , high-margin market, 
  ha , that 's par with using your cutlery like a drum set in the ` rude behaviour at the table ' stakes . 
  some good things to trade are items that, 
  * are dropped , rather than manufactured , so supply can not ramp up to meet demand ( stuff that 's hard to produce also qualifies ), 
  * useful , so demand is non-zero,

   hi everyone . 
  after our very successful devs vs players frigate battle on duality earlier this release we have decided to run another similar event focused on cruisers . 
   a number of devs including myself will be playing on buckingham this thursday the ** 15th of november ** starting at ** 16:00 eve time ** . 
  we 'll start off the event with some organized fleets against whatever you can throw at us , then afterwords it should be pretty easy for all of you to find devs for casual 1v1s or skirmishes . 
   last time the devs were the undisputed champions so i think the players need to bring their a game this week to regain some pride . 
   it was a ton of fun last time so i hope you 'll all come back this thursday and take us on !, 
  part of a [ three ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/jesters-cap-battlecruiser-rebalancing/ ) [ part ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/fozzie-on-mindlinks/ ) [ series ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/running-the-numbers-on-fleet-boosts/ ) on the proposed battlecruiser changes . 
  ** tldr ; ** the [ huge bonus ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mindlink.png ) a mindlink gives will mess with fozzie 's vision of multiple-racial link bonuses on command ships , so will likely be heavily reworked . 
  [ part three ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/running-the-numbers-on-fleet-boosts/ ) explores what would need to change if mindlinks were [ adjusted ] ( http://serpentinelogic.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mindlink2.png ) . 
  for non pvp uses , the chimera is a fine choice . 
  it transports stuff , repairs pos tower shields , and you can use it for ratting or fighter support if you like that sort of thing . 
  not all ships * need * to be useful in pvp to be useful . 
  thats ironic , considering your user name . 
  depending on the exact ship , you have shield or armor tank options in all size classes . 
  however , it 's a lot faster to have a t2 shield tank so i suggest you run shield tank + autocannon and go with that . 
  someone did an estimate about 6 months ago . 
  the estimate was about half a million dollars , if converted into plex . 
  do n't forget being fingerprinted when you enter the country . 
  racial cruisers . 
  post summer , you will need racial battlecruiser v for command ships , so you will get all four for free , without needing cruiser v. 
  yes it does . 
  some things to concentrate on :, 
  * capacitor skills to iv , ideally v, 
  * mission-running social skills to iv , or v if they 're low ranked . 
  * tech 2 light drones + drone interfacing iv, 
  * missile support skills to iv, 
  * navigation support skills to iv, 
  * t2 cruise missiles, 
  your goal is to be able to fit your raven [ like this ] ( http://jestertrek.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/fit-of-week-mission-raven.html ) , and a good goal after that is to use [ liang nuren 's cnr fit ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/raven_navy_issue_%28fitting%29#navy_raven_a_la_liang ) , which is blingy but you get the idea . 
  alternatively , a torpedo golem would also be a reasonable goal , especially once the missile changes come down the pipeline . 
  you did n't [ know ] ( http://www.airnewzealand.com.au/us-entry-and-transit-requirements ) ? 
   ** arriving in the usa under the us-visit process **, 
   progressive changes to the u.s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) will see us customs and border protection officers collecting 10 fingerprints , from the current two fingerprints and take a digital photograph as part of the regular entry interview . 
  this data will be used to verify your identity and be compared against watch-lists . 
  the us-visit process will take place each time you arrive in the usa . 
  the first role you 'll need your carrier to perform is ` suitcase ' , i.e. 
  to move stuff around . 
  generally , once you have gallente carrier and fighters to a level you 're happy with , you remap int/mem and start on the navigation skills . 
  you 'll need jump drive calibration and jump fuel efficiency iv before it 's worth using a cyno . 
  you can get away with jdc iv in a carrier because they have long range , but you 'll need v or risk being left behind in other capital types . 
  jump fuel costs may be an issue since oxytopes are expensive , so you may need to get that to v as well . 
  a typical suitcase fit will be lots of cap rechargers and cap power relays , with maybe a couple of warp core stabs and the standard cloak/smartbombs/heavy neuts in the highs . 
  no capital modules are needed , but obviously a couple of capital armor reps would be useful . 
  generally speaking if you 're travel fit and get caught , kiss your carrier goodbye . 
  after that , typically people train capital reps and do some kind of slowcat anomaly/level 5 mission pve thing for a while . 
  then they wise up and train capital remote reps and triage so they 're more generally useful to the corp. 
  tbh , while you 're mapped that way , you might as well pick up gallente dread v , capital hybrids v and tactical weapon reconfig v. 
  the jump skills are int/per so you can muddle through to iv with your current remap . 
  [ kenya believe it ] ( http://www.weebls-stuff.com/songs/kenya/ ) ? 
  sadly , the list of items does not include a mercenary squad ( broken ) . 
  i think you 'll find that the elderly white racists will die off at the same rate as elderly hispanic racists , leaving both demographics more left-leaning as time goes on . 
  racial cruisers . 
  after the command ship change you will need racial battlecruiser v , not racial cruiser v , so you will get instant access to all eight command ships ... 
  it 's [ $ 12.45 per week ] ( http://www.medibank.com.au/healthcover/insurance/hospital-range/ ) in my country . 
  and that 's for the * private * option . 
  what 's it like in the usa ?
