  let me answer a vague request with a vague response . 
  sure , i guess . 
  maybe . 
  pink , like a phobos . 
  mobil did this during a recent price war near where i live . 
  apparently keeping prices higher than everyone else meant that queues at the pump were nonexistent . 
  customers would feel comfortable browsing the store instead of feeling pressured to get in , pay for their gas , then leave , leading to wildly increased profits while all the other gas stations were cutting each others ' throats over pennies . 
  one of the great things about eve is that you do n't have to grind for progression ; skill points accrue regardless of time logged in . 
  if you set things up correctly , income can also [ accrue passively ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-philosophy-of-passive-income ) while you 're logged out , freeing your time for more interesting things , and freeing your psyche from the irrational fear of loss .

  ** isk , you 're doing it wrong **, 
  by tarigal, 
  eve is a fascinating game . 
  as a sandbox , the players decide their interaction and culture . 
  gameplay is not a set path of experiences and quests , but many choices made overtime . 
  i started playing eve in 2006 and quickly lost interest . 
  there was no direction , no instruction , and a huge foreign universe . 
  what was fun ? 
  what should i avoid ? 
  i really had no idea where to start or what to get into . 
  the learning curve was huge , and i was n't the only one feeling that way either . 
  the fact is , eve is a tough place for newbies . 
  most get into what they know from other games : missions/quests . 
  some get into mining and other time intensive ways to make isk . 
  i followed the same path : i bought a merlin , and started hitting level one missions . 
  i worked my way up over weeks and months through thousands of tiny red bars until i was in a raven , doing level four missions . 
  the whole process felt good at first . 
  i was making more money , learning new skills , and i had several big plans on what types of ships i was going to fly `` one day , '' into epic pvp battles . 
  my experience with pvp at that point was pretty low , but i started flying with friends and was very excited whenever we would go out to roam . 
  i would fly easy ships to get into skill-wise , like tacklers and interceptors . 
  i liked being the scout and flying at 6,000 km/s . 
  i was a dog fighter !, 
  after sometime , the novelty started to wear off . 
  most of the time , we would not find fights . 
  when we did get into a fight , it would often be against some lone pilot who was caught in an unfortunate situation , and a very cheap ship . 
  when we lost , it was usually to a much larger gang where we basically had to run at the start . 
  i eventually quit eve again because i did not see much point in doing something without any challenge or fun . 
  i came back to eve awhile later and began to notice that many people felt the same way i did about eve . 
  they would complain about how lame pvp is , or how boring pve can be : `` solo pvp is dead ... everyone just blobs all the time ... i can never get good fights ... these ships are useless ... tired of getting killed in hi sec ... '' i heard all of these statements in one form or another . 
  these complaints boil down to a basic misunderstanding ... 
  ** the problem **, 
  the majority of eve 's newbie player base goes through a very predictable cycle :, 
  * they play pve , such as mining and mission running , to make and save up isk ( usually boring after the initial learning curve ) . 
  * once they make a certain amount , they gain enough confidence to use some isk to buy a shiny ship which they take into pvp . 
  the cycle has a negative and positive aspect . 
  the negative aspect is the pve that most people participate in . 
  pve is a bit like having a job : it is n't that exciting , you do n't really enjoy it , but you do it because you have to buy things that you do find exciting . 
  the second part of the cycle is positive : you get to buy cool ships , take them into challenging situations , and play in the sandbox that is eve . 
  the problem starts because of a misunderstanding of an often heard mantra in eve . 
  everyone has heard the golden rule : `` do n't fly any ship you can not afford to lose . '' the saying has good intentions . 
  it points people towards an experience where it is okay to either win or lose , as long as the pilot has fun . 
  however , the cycle is structured in a way that prevents the pilot from choosing to flying in a carefree state of mind . 
  the misunderstanding comes from believing that an isk is an isk . 
  the fact is , some isk is not worth the same as other isk . 
  if you make all your isk doing things you do not enjoy , ** that isk grows exponentially in value because you will want to * avoid * doing those things again ** . 
  see how that works ? 
  most pilots set themselves up for failure because they make isk in a way that completely over values isk in the first place . 
  therefore , any ship they buy , they over value in turn . 
  here is an interesting question : which would you rather have , 100 million isk that you make over 1 hour of missioning , or 20 million isk you make over 1 day , but that you did n't even log on to make ? 
  most newbies come into eve with the mindset that an isk is an isk , so they take the 100 million isk because it seems like a better deal . 
  that is the wrong answer . 
  instead , take the 20 million isk because you put much less effort into getting it . 
  to me , the 20 million is actually worth more than the 100 million because it does not gain the `` negative value '' associated with grinding missions or rats !, 
  i am truly fascinated when i see people treat all isk with the same value , when the real value comes from how you make your isk . 
  so what happens when that player , who made that 100 million isk in an hour , buys a ship and takes it out to pvp ? 
  the pilot 's mind actually makes a connection now between that hour , and the ship he is flying . 
  to lose that ship is to lose that hour of his life . 
  with this connection established , we see why people blob : that pilot has to blob , he has no other choice because he sees safety in numbers , and he does not want to lose that hour of his life . 
  i should qualify and say that a blob is not simply overwhelming tactics . 
  when something of value , like a pos or a system , is threatened , then large scale pvp is a valid , and sometimes fun response . 
  defining a blob can be difficult because it is more of an attitude towards risk then an actual group of players . 
  the attitude seeks to avoid risk by overwhelming the enemy , and yet gain a feeling of satisfaction at winning . 
  in other words ; `` getting something for nothing . '', 
  however this can not be done in the long term . 
  blobbing is fun for no one ; neither getting blobbed or blobbing others . 
  in a blob , a pilot 's quickly loses any * individual * feeling of accomplishment . 
  if they get blobbed , again they do not get to shine because they get extremely outnumbered . 
  to most of these pilots who are afraid to lose their ships ( they have no choice because of the cycle , remember ? 
  ) , they only get a good fight once in a great while . 
  what is a good fight ? 
  a fight that requires their skill , feels exhilarating , and leaves a lasting positive impression , * no matter the outcome * . 
  the sad fact is , even winning fights for most of these newbs offers them nothing . 
  at first it seems fun to get some kills here and there , but soon they get jaded and want something more . 
  to sum up the problem so far , we can now answer two questions . 
  first , why would a pilot chose to join a blob , even though blobbing is not in their best interest ? 
  the pilot values her time , and the ship represents the boring pve she did to get it . 
  no matter how much you bludgeon a player with that old mantra `` do n't fly a ship you ca n't afford to lose , '' the player must care because she values her time , and does n't want to do boring pve again . 
  time is money . 
  the second question we can answer is why newbies quit eve . 
  well would n't you quit if you constantly felt like you were working for money that was used to play in lame-o blobs ? 
  the cycle of making money in a boring way , and then losing it in an un-fun way , over and over again , is why people leave . 
  they just never get ahead . 
  ** the solution : part 1 **, 
  the solution to this crummy cycle must come with a mindset change within the individual player . 
  first , some isk is more valuable than other isk . 
  isk that is made through manufacturing , trading , station trading , scamming ( if you are so inclined ) , investment , and other ways of making isk * with * isk has much less of a negative association then other forms of pve .
