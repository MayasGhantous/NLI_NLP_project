  passive income is the name of the game . 
  you want to be making isk every day without actually playing the game . 
  we play games for fun , not to add more work to our already overworked lives . 
  finding passive income takes work , but is completely viable for any newbie in eve . 
  start reading the market discussion forums and you will soon have some viable options . 
  if you really do not know where to start , rat or mission some money up , and find ways to invest it . 
  the bottom line is you want to stop playing ( is it really playing ? ), 
  the modes you find boring , and start making passive income as soon as possible . 
  you will probably make much less money than you would if you were playing actively , but your account balance will grow overtime , and much faster than you think . 
  establishing passive income solves the first part of the cycle as the pilot is now making isk with a positive personal value . 
  isk will no longer have a negative personal value associated with boring work . 
  ** the solution : part 2 **, 
  the second part of the cycle is the unfulfilling pvp that most newbies experience ( aka : blobs and no personal accomplishment situations ) . 
  i would like to introduce my new golden rule that will point people in the right direction :, 
  * eve is not just about making isk , but knowing how to lose it well . 
  the phrase is short and sweet , but has large ramifications . 
  ask almost any player and they will say `` losing isk = bad . '' this is not true !, 
  i am asking for a radical shift in thinking for most players . 
  i want you to go into any pvp situation , and lose your ship in the most gratifying way possible . 
  sounds ridiculous right ? 
  you have passive income every day that requires very little input , and maybe even gains as little as 5-20 million isk per day . 
  at this point , you are set up to actually start playing the game , instead of working at it . 
  you want to find ships that are within your daily budget , and then go fly them into oblivion in whatever way you choose . 
  most people will not choose to fly them in large blobs , or against large blobs . 
  remember , you are not really paying for these ships ; they cost none of your `` negative '' time . 
  in essence , these are `` free '' ships on an emotional level because you made them in a way that feels positive . 
  at this point , you actually get to experience the true potential of any sandbox game . 
  you get to choose how you want to experience your free ships . 
  before , when every ship was valued in `` negative '' time , the player had very little choice because losing isk = more negative time . 
  no one on the entire planet wants that . 
  with passive income , and a change in mindset , the pilot now has a choice because the cost of his ship is no longer on the line . 
  the game becomes fun and enjoyable because every pvp situation does not have the old possibility of having to go back to the missioning/mining hole of doom . 
  their choice becomes how to use that isk in a very fun way , which means invariably losing it in the best way possible . 
  just like in real life , you do not get to take anything with you once you `` quit . '' knowing that , how do you want to spend what you earn before you check out ? 
  the ancient egyptians were obsessed with taking their possessions into the afterlife , but they were flat wrong . 
  ** you kick the bucket and it all stays here , so learn how to lose the money you earn and your experience will invariably become much more enjoyable . 
  ** conclusion : **, 
  i think eve is a blast . 
  i work a lot , and i do n't get to play much , but i make passive income every day . 
  when i do play , i actually play the game . 
  i like pvp and i get to test a ship to its very extreme . 
  i want to see how far i can push that ship using boosters , mods , overloading , and gang bonuses . 
  can i take a 1v2 ? 
  a 1v3 ? 
  who knows , but i want to find out !, 
  what about trying it with a buddy who has the same attitude ? 
  ** remember , there is nothing on the line , so it 's all about playing and enjoying . 
  i get to look for fights , even outnumbered . 
  getting blobbed still is n't fun , but i do n't mind losing the ship , and i might get a kill or two before i go down ( fun ! ) . 
  i actually feel worse for the blob because they have very little fun , and many usually go back to missioning or ratting after the roam ( bleh ) . 
  i think of most of them as unenlightened players , still following the old mode of thinking that will eventually make them quit with disgust , apathy , and boredom . 
  as a sandbox , no one is going to make eve fun for you ; you have to figure out your own fun . 
  eve both sucks , and is awesome . 
  it sucks because you are given nothing ; you have to do all the work . 
  fun is not served on a platter to you . 
  it is also awesome because you get to choose exactly how you have fun ; you are n't boxed into some game style that just does n't fit for you . 
  i hope you enjoyed this article . 
  remember , passive income , and learning how to lose isk well are the two keys to enjoying this universe . 
  ** epilogue ( 1 year later ) : **, 
  when i wrote this , i was in a much different place then i am now . 
  i had very little isk , and this white paper was my vision of how i wanted to play eve . 
  however it left a few things out . 
  the basic ideas presented in this paper are valid for many players , but not for all of them . 
  for example , some people like to go mission and mine . 
  this paper is not really for them . 
  others have no problems with isk at all , and are very rich , yet they still find their experience in eve lacking in some way . 
  they might find themselves afraid to go out in ships for fear of looking bad , or failing . 
  the point is this paper is not all inclusive , but it is a great pointer for people stuck in the pve rut . 
  missioning and mining are the easiest to get into , and i do not think there is a pilot out there who has not tried them at some point . 
  if you are stuck in that rut , and thinking of quitting eve because you are tired of pve and spinning your ship , i urge you to take this paper to heart and reach out . 
  find players who are having fun in the game and strike up a conversation with them . 
  ask them how to have fun ; not how to win , be powerful , or whatever . 
  you may strike out a lot , but someone along the way will present an idea to you that will really hit home , and you 'll be having fun in no time . 
  fly dangerous !, 
  pop a couple of bhaalgorns and it 's still worth it . 
  recruit from out of game instead . 
  i imagine so . 
  the full disclosure guy picked up a [ few members ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/bearforce+academy ) that way ( he then picked up a [ few more ] ( http://evewho.com/corp/fweddit ) ) ; i imagine other industrialists like / u/raath and / u/blakea could pick up recruits that way if so inclined . 
  i 'm training not leaking intel specialization iv . 
  well , i really should put [ not autopiloting through lowsec ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/whoops/ ) into my training plan . 
  it appears i need it . 
  alternatively , merge or ally with another industry corp. . my alt corp builds capital ships ; affiliated corps do t3 production in wormholes ; yet another affiliate appears to be ~ ~ one guy multiboxing retrievers ~ ~ a mining corporation . 
  it 's all one big dysfunctional family . 
  the year 's worth of game time in my character 's wallet ? 
  tengu will still be fine . 
  fit hams if you 're worried about dps . 
  except he does n't lie , then when caught , lie harder . 
  how do you determine that the debt is legitimately owed , and not one of the many ` bank errors in their favor ' ( e.g. 
  mistaken foreclosures ) that happened during the gfc ? 
  i see your point ( governor romney was pretty moderate , compared to presidential candidate romney ) . 
  romney jettisoned practically all his principles to get the gop nomination , though , much like mccain in 08 . 
  is that with scourge fury though ? 
  they worked fine in sanctums vov,
