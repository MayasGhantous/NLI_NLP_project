  cheap ones ? 
  and missions you can do in a stealth bomber ? 
  faction warfare is well suitable . 
  +3 s are cheap vov, 
  sometimes i do n't even f, 
  agreed . 
  australia institutes a flat 15 % tax going into a retirement account ( capped to prevent millionaires dumping into it ) and zero percent coming out once you 're 60 years old . 
  it 's not that hard ; it just needs regulatory support . 
  it 's more complicated than that , mate . 
  * capital gains counts as income , but you only pay tax on half your gains if you held the asset for 1 year +, 
  * stocks do n't provide anywhere near the level of capital gains as they do in the usa , because dividends in australia are ~ ~ ~ tax-free ( technically , the tax is paid by the company ) . 
  the rich will still use this method to avoid paying the bulk of their tax burden . ~ ~ ~, 
  ** update ** apparently i was subtly wrong on australian dividends . 
  they are n't strictly tax-free ; instead , the dividends come with a [ 30 % tax credit ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/franking-credits-made-simple-20110627-1gmvf.html ) ( i.e. 
  the same rate the company paid ) . 
  if your marginal tax rate is above 30 % , you 'll have to chip in to make up the difference ; if your marginal rate is < 30 % , you will get a tax refund instead . 
  this is * even better * at stopping the rich from avoiding tax . 
  if your new corp has an office in a station with cloning facilities , you can change your medical clone location to that station . 
  that way , even if you do get popped , you 'll arrive at your destination instead of back where you started . 
  demand all you want ; just do n't expect others to pander to your inability to handle subtlety and indirectness .

  the refutation of objectivism does not need to rely on [ tu quoque ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) arguments anyway . 
  updated my post ; apparently the system is even better than i originally explained . 
  updated op . 
  r&d , manufacturing and pi updating via crest on my mobile . 
  with an outdated targeting reticle . 
  that 's a strange way to spell bain capital . 
  probably better to try low sec closer to home . 
  flying around the teshkat pocket is a more gentle introduction to lowsec life . 
  the take away is , being an industrialist is neat , but starting out as a pure industrialist is pretty difficult . 
  do n't forget to research the compression blueprints ... 
  i did nazi that coming . 
  something combat related ; when you have combat skills theres a lot if avenues open to you , although most people start by running missions for a few weeks . 
  generally , starting a new industry character on the same account is a better idea ( or start a new account using the power of two offer that happens regularly ), 
  considered rolling it into aura ? 
  auschwitz people would lighten up a bit . 
  why not ? 
  +2 implants are cheap , and when you 're paying 600m/month for your sub via plex , 30 minutes training improvement adds up . 
  hi im twelve and what is this, 
  more people need to pester marcel about aura plug in library development anyway . 
  clean other students rooms . 
  do their laundry . 
  after all , you only need enough money for a months subscription , right ? 
  if only you lived in a society where people with credit cards can be befriended . 
  perhaps you just have a thin skin . 
  university of wollongong . 
  holy shit i thought the entire csm except for hans had dropped off the face of the earth . 
  veterans need to see improvements in eve , to prevent them getting bitter and unsubbing . 
  bittervets all have personal ` sucking chest wounds ' they want fixed , sure , but they also need new shiny things to try out , or they wo n't even resub to find out how much better the game is now . 
  i would like to point out that crest has a massive potential to expand the scope of the game , way beyond the constraints of the eve client on a desktop computer , and ccp should make every effort to support third party developers in their efforts , both from the financial benefits to having free work done by your players , and the safety valve that pain points can be alleviated before they cause a trade hub to burn down . 
  it 's also a * dis * incentive to iterative development . 
  i believe india also escaped the gfc because its banks were n't allowed to engage in the circlejerk hot potato of the us subprime market . 
  not sure how wildly its banking system varies from ours though . 
  wow , that was all one sentence . 
  for the most part , yes . 
  the only substantial thing that has changed in the last few months has been buffing about 60 of the lesser-powered ships to full combat capacity . 
  [ lots of people ] ( http://omgrawr.net/quote/2885 ) ask that . 
  they are combat sites that can be found via scanning them down . 
  depends what the ratting type is . 
  if it 's belt ratting , go in , kill everything ( unless it would take too long ) , go to the next belt . 
  if it 's cosmic anomalies , go in , kill frigates , then everything else , wait for the next spawn wave . 
  anything beyond that should have a specific guide you * can * find via google . 
  published by sony , though . 
  \\* cough \\* evegate \\* cough \\*, 
  *** so *** not surprised . 
  human nature . 
  ha so many similar portraits . 
  only frigates scram . 
  also theyre a lot easier to kill while mwding towards you than in tight orbit . 
  watching dust plus eve  watching eve, 
  crest is named for the technology used , but the main draw card is the ability to write changes via api . 
  send eve mails . 
  lodge factory jobs . 
  reset extractors . 
  solution : timer on lodging industry jobs via crest . 
  a 23 hour timer per production line would lessen the idle time of your production lines without necessarily eliminating it . 
  im ok with making highsec better if it makes a better game . 
  the high sec low sec balance will be a bumpy ride for everyone so im not hung up about the occasional lurch one way or the other . 
  imo , timers work well to stop bots but allow humans through . 
  imo , even the most hard core inventor wont check their pc or mobile more often than morning , lunch , evening then login via their main computer at night . 
  nerfing mineral compression can only be done after non-high-sec mining is fixed anyway . 
  stuff would be on a timer . 
  that cuts both ways ... 
  if you slow down a bot so it 's not more efficient than a human , then that 's an acceptable outcome . 
  \\  implying this ca n't be done already . 
  it 's not as if it 's anonymous eve-api calls ; ccp knows who 's doing what , and can take steps as usual . 
  buy a procurer . 
  they 're like 7 million isk . 
  imo , the procurer is way more cost efficient for a newbie miner . 
  * only one strip miner means less outlay on high slots , and reduced penalties from mining upgrades in the low slows, 
  * spacious fitting means you wo n't lose your ship to belt rats ( fit a medium shield extender , ideally two , also hobgoblin drones ), 
  * lots of mid slots means you can spare one for a survey scanner , which is awesome for working out which rock to target, 
  * really , really cheap so you can afford to lose one to players without raging . 
  imo it 's better to spend the money you saved on some +3 implants for intelligence and perception . 
  that 's a shame , because there was a massive surge in interest about them . 
  of course , the main problem was how over powered they were . 
  way more ships have spare high slots compared to spare mids ( phoons , scorps , interceptors etc ) , so it would need a significant range nerf to balance against this . 
  my eyeball calculation implies a cut to 10km optimal + 15km falloff would be a good start . 
  ccp could build that into the eve client itself ( and arguably should do ) , but in the mean time , i 'd much rather have a workaround like that via crest than no workaround at all . 
  ah , ok , replacement for jsonp .
