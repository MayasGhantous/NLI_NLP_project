  i 'd prefer not to * migrate * , but i would be ok with syndication via rss or whatever . 
  it 's not about resistance to change ; it 's about control . 
  do n't forget haulers . 
  can you also ask them to expose me/pe info on blueprints via the assets api ? 
  i just installed eve isk per hour and i 'd prefer not to manually enter the stats for the ** 3074 ** bpos i have . 
  let 's start with tech 2 titans then iterate , shall we ? 
  well , the ccp devs have dust on their pcs so it 's quite possible . 
  the problem is that there 's good business reasons why they ca n't do a pc release until x months after ps3 release . 
  which is disappointing because they should have clear goals of where they want to take the eve-dust link ( ideas are cheaper than developer time , and can be done * years * before code is cut ) . 
  imo ccp needs to start generating buzz amongst eve players as well . 
  the resources required are minuscule ( think about how turgid we get over sarmatiko 's leaks or fast-cuts to a dev 's monitor during a video devblog ) and the payoff is great , both from a new player acquisition sense , and a defensive , customer-relations sense . 
  personally , i do n't mind the low ( but not zero ) - impact nature of dust . 
  even in games like tf2 , there 's the usual pub games and the srs business leagues . 
  being able to easily drop into a game and get shot at a bit fills the same niche as red vs blue , and i 'm ok with that . 
  this happens already , but unfortunately the formula is capped at something ridiculously low , so you never notice . 
  i suppose , although even partial-specialization would be good . 
  sure . 
  charters are still cheap , even though the components of fuel blocks have risen a lot since npc sell orders ... 
  any high slot ewar would be the same . 
  plus , they 're only 68 million isk for a set of low grades . 
  i dont see why lowsec shouldnt get +50 rocks just like null sec . 
  if anything , belts in lowsec are even more dangerous than in null . 
  it can be a combination of increased yield , and crystals that ca n't be used in high sec ... 
  of course , if ccp released capital mining barges ... 
  this is a good post . 
  perhaps ultra-high yield crystals would only be available for low-ends . 
  that could work . 
  what you want is more * mining * being done . 
  the number of people doing it is immaterial .

  i assume you 're training battlecruisers v , in preparation of it being split into four racial skills ? 
  you know what , it would be a lot easier if you 'd post an eveboard link so we can see . 
  i do n't think that will work . 
  mining ships that can shoot back are suboptimal . 
  a more pertinent question is : how long would it take to break even with a freighter , compared to using courier contracts , factoring in the time it takes you to fly it ? 
  shannara reference , mate . 
  well , neut drones arent stacking nerfed . 
  failheap has one called quackbot that does this . 
  you may know the author from his famous saying , since termed malcanis ' law , which states, 
   whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of ` new players ' , that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer , older players . 
  oh , it 's not that bad . 
  i usually offer at least 50k per jump for a full freighter load . 
  people even accept it . 
  why would you * ever * build ships in lowsec that you can build in highsec instead ? 
  i did n't ; youth allowance is means-tested . 
   i 'm pretty sure every employer gives at least a week of vacation time, 
  a * single * week off per year ? 
  even the japanese take more time off work than that . 
  so , why not sell them in situ , then ? 
  tbh build times only matter when you 're selling everything you make as soon as it 's completed . 
  you can already make 200m isk/day just building scythes in highsec , if you do n't care about selling what you make . 
  look at how their lackadaisical lifestyle has fared for them *** since *** world war 2 . 
  do n't be afraid to scan in low-sec either . 
  just do n't bring anything expensive down there for the first month or so . 
  a good idea is to scan in a tech 1 exploration frigate , then swap to a destroyer or cruiser if you find something good . 
  ( you 'll also have to scan from a safe spot if your ship does n't have a cloaking device fit , unless you want uninvited visitors to drop in ), 
  never not be afraid to never say never get fooled again . 
  i wouldnt take a battleship into low sec without corp mates handy . 
  they take too long to warp . 
  solution : use 5 tractors , 3 salvagers and set the drones to auto-engage . 
  ganking in stations ^ tm, 
  i meant it takes too long to warp when another player is trying to kill you . 
  which they will try to , because low sec space lets them . 
  if you want to shoot at stuff smaller than battleship size , bring along a crash booster . 
  it makes a hell of a difference . 
  if you want to see what the others look like , you can check out the [ passive ] ( http://i.imgur.com/72avy.jpg ) and [ active ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5rszq.jpg ) hardeners . 
  edit : oh , you updated op . 
  most countries use ` tonne ' for metric tons . 
  tldr ; test and goons are successful because they minimise the roles of corps ( and their dead-weight leadership ) and control everything from the few ` actually good ' leaders at alliance level instead . 
  just a note : it would be a * really * good idea to build as many cruisers ( of the right type ) before retribution hits , because the build costs of many cruiser types will rise . 
  for instance , you can make 1.7 m isk profit per scythe , even with a me0 blueprint . 
  that 's somewhat unusual ... 
  most people research stuff in a pos or lowsec station , then bring the bpo back . 
  if you 're going to make ships , a 15-run cruiser bpc takes a couple days to copy - more than it takes to build the cruisers . 
  for modules , it makes sense to build off bpcs because you 're usually building 300 warrior i 's then immediately using invented bpcs to turn them into warrior iis , but for the larger stuff it 's better to build from bpo . 
  as if anyone in fa is competent enough to ... 
  they 're recorded in the blueprints on the test server , does that count ? 
  in that case , build whatever cruiser ( s ) has the greatest profit now on tq . 
  youre not good at this ` explaining ' business are you . 
  the directors of dreddit ** are ** the alliance directors , for all intents and purposes . 
  ... who is no longer at ccp . 
  missioning in caldari space with an amarr ship is an exercise in frustration . 
  try in amarr space . 
  its a famous australian phrase from the 1980 's . 
  most guristas pirates have strong resistances to lasers , so youre doing about half as much damage as you would vs amarrian pirates . 
  obvious they were * legitimate * protests . 
  yeah , the certificate system is a reasonable way to work out what combination of skills will hell your character in which way . 
  except for core targeting . 
  even low level core targeting certs require targeting v , which only a few ship types even need . 
  a good neural remap plan for new players is maximum intelligence , with the rest in perception ( a balanced int/per split is also ok , but int primary allows you front-load your support skills then go full perception + willpower for an entire year while training pilot and weapon skills ), 
  if youre going to train for something , why * not * train for the flavor of the month ? 
  when dramiels were overpowered , it made little sense to train for a worse ship ... 
  you can shield tank a thorax . 
  why be exceptional at bad ships when you can be exceptional with awesome ships ? 
  are you talking about the overton window , or something different ? 
  underground electricity cables also waste a fair bit of electricity .
