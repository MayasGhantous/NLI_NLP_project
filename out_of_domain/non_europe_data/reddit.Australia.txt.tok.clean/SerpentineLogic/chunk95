  in my first year engineering course , the lecturer got us to work out what the voltage would be if 132kv went into an underground line from < city 1  to < city 2  as proposed by a local politician . 
  ( answer : about 3 volts would be left from 132kv ), 
  given the changes to battlecruiser skills , you should be training it now . 
  [ that one .

  even small differences in line loss result in needing entire extra power plants .

  itt people reinventing the wheel,

  it 's a fairly prudent ` cover your ass ' clause , although a more prudent university would have stated ` workers must be escorted/supervised in ** all ** dorms ', 
  rapiers : which fleet comps are they viable in , and do you name them all ` xenosis ' ? 
  australian here . 
  what 's racist about that ? 
  does spade have some hidden connotation in the states ? 
  the problem is n't with publicly run elections ; it 's with the corruption . 
  just get gal cruiser iii then battlecruisers to v, 
  illegal as fuck . 
  the hell ? 
  a freighter is something you fly by necessity , rather than choice . 
  its quite easy to get into a freighter , but i suggest that if you are already doing the mining thing , its better to skill into an orca instead . 
  healthcare work entitles you to [ priority working visas ] ( http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/medical-practitioners/ ) to australia ( and a host of other countries ) , where the pay rates are [ not terrible ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/au/job=registered_nurse_%28rn%29/hourly_rate ) . 
  in fact , in northwest australia , nurses easily pull six figures . 
  and of course it all comes with health care , retirement funding and what not . 
  i 'm not pointing this out to gloat ; i 'm saying that ** emigration is a viable option ** . 
  tldr ; everyone wants nurses , especially outside capital cities . 
  battlecruisers would work . 
  amarr ones do n't even use ammo , 
  do n't forget level 5 missions if there are any agents nearby . 
  ah , roleplayers .

  many native australian aboriginal communities have declared they are dry communities . 
  it does n't magically prevent access , but societal expectations do help a lot . 
  the enzyme breaks down alcohol faster , but the chemicals it breaks down into are n't particularly healthy for you . 
  ( you can get around this somewhat by taking a particular medicine that pharmacy students use to avoid hangovers ), 
  if you have another , different gene as well , then you can metabolize those different by-products , making you into a demigod among drinkers . 
  tldr ; alcohol makes your face red and may give you cancer . 
  from what i have seen of remote communities , practically all the money spent on * anything * goes outside the community . 
  train pi and mining bonuses . 
  train everything else . 
  why would you think that they need ' a genetic link ' ? 
  large chunks of the planet have this genetic signature . 
  are you also suspicious because people in ireland and china both have black hair ? 
  an asian friend of mine explained it to me thus . 
  `` you know how you get a few drinks into you and you feel great , then you drink a few more and things get marginal , then if you keep drinking you either pass out or hurl ? 
  yeah asians skip the feeling great part . '', 
  unlikely , although there 's strong evidence that redheads are quite resistant to anesthetic , so there is precedent . 
   it makes me look like i 'm wasted after one or two drinks . 
  technically , you are * half * wasted . 
  oh , i have a mining/industry character on the same account as my main ( i transferred it over after power of two deal ran out ) . 
  there really is n't a lot of overlap between pvp skills and industry skills , so i remapped to int/mem and let it train . 
  the down side is that i ca n't login both characters at once , but the up side is that industry alts do n't need to be online a lot . 
  just log in , queue up some jobs , do some afk mining or log out . 
  plus , it saves 600m isk/month that i could be spending on recon ships . 
  sif petrol bowsers are n't padlocked these days . 
  some japanese ( and other asians ) have a further mutation that allows them to metabolize alcohol byproducts ( even faster than whites ) . 
  this makes for an interesting dichotomy , where there are simultaneously two opposing stereotypes : that of the red-faced boozer , and the stoic drinker who will quaff wine all night with no apparent effects . 
  of course , it 's also possible that they enjoy the effects while others do n't , just like some people do n't like tomatoes .

  you are *** so *** going to like mining .

  i guess someone really likes bubble wrapping their tower . 
  corps can have offices in stations with their own hangar bays . 
  they may also deploy starbase towers and customs offices . 
  in sovereign null-security space , they may also own stations , although typically stations are owned by the executor corp of the alliance instead . 
  getting into a corp is as easy as you applying and them accepting . 
  there 's a thread about corps in the sidebar . 
  think what you want . 
  i agree with your arguments . 
  jester is very rarely wrong on facts , which elevates him above half the csm already . 
  plus , he doesnt really want the job , which eliminates the ` free trip to iceland ' argument . 
  yeah , i could see myself sending a couple votes his way . 
  twice a year , ccp offers a power of two promotion ; get a new account with 6 months subscription for about $ 50 .

  blue tongue is terrible ; it 's like they brewed bad beer then waved some ginger at it and left it at that . 
  stones does ginger beer and its famous ginger wine , which i mix 50/50 with lemonade . 
  it was either that , or gtfo . 
  nothing is loading ( except for the titles of each section ) :(, 
  why not use eve mentat or iskperhour ? 
  i swear the amount of wheel-reinventing in this subreddit is over 9000 . 
  i doubt ccp will release the game with the controls in this state . 
  better check the recent patch notes then . 
  phew , for a minute there i thought you wrote ` brush up * against * the locals ' .
