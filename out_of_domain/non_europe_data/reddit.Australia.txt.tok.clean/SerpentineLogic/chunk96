  ** first up , officer spawns : **, 
  the drone regions have been missing officer spawns ( the highest end npcs , usually carrying high bounties and rare loot ) for a long time so with retribution this winter we are adding them . 
  exactly where and how often they spawn is up to you guys to figure out . 
  here are the four new officers you can expect to find :, 
  ** second and along with officer spawns comes officer modules : **, 
  since we were creating new officers we decided it would be a great time to introduce not just new officers . 
  we also decided it would be a great time to add officer drone modules . 
  you high sec care bears , erm mission runners , now have more ways to spend insane amounts of isk pimping your ship . 
  i am not going to list exact stats and would like to remind those that go running off to a test server , to find the stats of the following item : magic crystal ball, 
  * drone damage amplifier, 
  * drone link augmentor, 
  * omnidirectional tracking link, 
  * drone control unit, 
  ** adding new spawns so we must add hauler spawns : **, 
  along with new officer spawns we have added new hauler spawns to the drone regions . 
  you will find them spread across all of the drone regions and with names matching and drops matching those of hauler spawns from other regions . 
  ** rouge drone salvage : ** ( sic ), 
  after having done some research we found that the salvage offered by npcs in the drone regions was below that of what we would expect from npcs in all other regions . 
  we are therefore buffing the salvage from the npcs in the drone regions by 2 % across the board . 
  we hope you find these changes enjoyable and worthwhile . 
  if you have any feedback please make your way to the comments section of this post where we will be answering your questions . 
  oh , also , rouge drones now give a sec status gain when you kill them . 
  just a little something we also added . 
  ccp foxfour, 
  thats what she wrote vov, 
  they are only a fraction better than t2 , now that t2 also got a buff in retribution . 
  drone damage amps : +19 % changing to +23 %, 
  on phone so no copy pasta . 
  ** tldr ; ** 1 plex = 1 issue of eon magazine sent to you , via the redemption system . 
  i am continually amused by how much money ccp gets from people who do n't actually play the game any more . 
  then again , half my accounts are playing skill training online so i guess i ca n't talk . 
  suas is always flying shit like that . 
  i assume this is an alt of his . 
  how 's your vacation in i-red space going , and have you considered going further afield ( stain etc ) ? 
  depends on your transversal . 
  i look forward to the day you guys say ` booley has n't lost a cap in weeks . 
  fuck it , let 's go full ef-f on ze germans '' . 
  i trust you guys will be camping the fuck out of 4c next tuesday ? 
  ca n't ; already setting up a camping op ~ elsewhere ~ . 
  message me if you want to coordinate . 
  i killed an npc cruiser in a belt in null sec last night . 
  260k isk , took 12 seconds to kill . 
  once you get the skills , making isk isnt a problem . 
  even better is a corp that provides you with replacement ships , so you never * have * to grind for income . 
  might be nda session . 
  imagine the shit storm if they announced that the topic was pos revamp and during the meeting they realised ` crap this is more work than we thought , gon na have to reschedule it ' . 
  tbh , ccp marketing sometimes offers a ` come back to see the new expansion ' deal . 
  sometimes it 's `` play free for 5 days '' , other times it 's `` five bucks for a month '' or something . 
  it 's very random though . 
  so good to fly . 
  also demolishes belt rats if you 're bored . 
  it does ~ 1000dps , so why not ? 
  bonus points if someone drops in and you get a real fight . 
  updated textures , probably . 
  [ sons of alexander ] ( http://www.soaclan.co.nz ) is an au/nz timezone nullsec pvp and pve corp. . we have a ship reimbursement program , so you can fight without needing to grind . 
  normally we have a minimum skill-point requirement , but that 's currently waived for new recruits . 
  tldr ; stuff we already know , plus ** bulk purchasing from lp store **, 
  we 'd already killed a test vigilant so we were pretty happy with how the roam turned out . 
  does n't a command ship * already * have the tank of a high-end sub-capital ? 
  tldr ; fewer npc faction rats in complexes . 
  we have carriers for that . 
  i do that , plus a kickback to my alliance as affiliate fee . 
  there 's at least three au timezone alliances in syndicate who regularly fight each other . 
  message me for details . 
  tldr ; corp hangars on ships will be transformed into fleet hangars and will be scannable , ** unless you 're in a blockade runner ** . 
  i , too , miss homeworld-style formations . 
  it 's a previously-unannounced change . 
  turns out ccp is learning to keep surprises back to put into dev blogs close to release . 
  needs tiericide , 
  yes , you need an office in a station in system + scientific networking trained to i. 
  after that , you can research the bpos from the station using slots in the pos . 
  you can even make copies , although the copies are output in the specific lab and hangar that you specified when you lodged the job . 
  any of the corps that used to be in mostly harmless are uk time zone . 
  carrier : capital remote reps. 
  dread : capital dps . 
  fly which ever one your corp needs vov, 
  i meant `` fly a carrier vs a dread '' not `` fly a phoenix vs a moros '', 
  how bulk is bulk ? 
  i ask because even people who make 40 capital ships per month buy their minerals from trade hubs . 
  what do plex sell for in china anyway ? 
  so , basically two kidneys . 
  one of my friends went on holiday and came back with a shirt he picked up in austria . 
  it says `` austria . 
  we have no kangaroos '' . 
  apparently it sells quite well . 
  not since last century . 
  australia has a ridiculously low family migration quota compared to other countries . 
  in fact , it 's a flagship for the ` skills or gtfo ' method of selecting immigrants . 
  i just wish i could look at my most-upvoted comments , they 're probably all snarky comments like this . 
  there 's a bunch of guys from failheap who pvp on serenity server . 
  apparently it 's like shooting fish in a barrel . 
  the [ killboard ] ( http://killboard.nl ) is down at the moment , but suffice to say that much crying old experts is harvesting tears at 93 % efficiency . 
  not a chance . 
  you need a semi hacked client and a chinese id card number . 
  if only that worked :(,

  [ boom-de-yah-da , boom-de-yah-da ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaxmramww6i ), 
  i suggest something like the [ ten hour hero ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=159023 ) build for your mates . 
  a single tornado can pop one . 
  it 's worth doing just on principle .
