  i hope you mean ` cpu and powergrid ' . 
  capacitor size and regen are nice , but you can go a long time with them only at iv . 
  only if you shield tank them , which works against the primary tanking method i.e. 
  get all the relevant ones up to iii asap . 
  you also might want to try training some secondary skills that affect fitting :, 
  * weapon upgrades, 
  * shield upgrades, 
  most of [ these ] ( http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/-mostly_harmless-/corporations ) corps are predominantly eu timezone . 
  post fit ? 
  not really . 
  cancer is a problem for individual creatures , because one bad mutation will kill the organism . 
  it 's less of a problem for the children , because , * on average * , the sperm and eggs will be unmutated . 
  throw all the sperm at all the eggs , see which are viable ? 
  conception scales really well in parallel, 
  \\* cough \\* mackinaws \\* cough \\*, 
  patch speculation . 
  is there any reason why your wife ca n't join your corp ? 
  to be honest , i would have expected ** you ** to join whatever corp your wife joins . 
  i 'm just testing their tank . 
  if it 's east khanid trading , they 're pretty cool . 
  i use wyke mossari 's [ spreadsheet ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ar_ytocxpvb9dgfidhjlb0vmyxborwrrcxfkehnjcwc&amp;hl=en_gb#gid=10 ) . 
  he does n't play any more , but hopefully it will keep working for a while longer . 
  mike devoid also has a [ processing-only spreadsheet ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0aplom5dd7fuedhrktdlsmeo3dnnpsddmmnmtsvfmx 2c ) , which i should check the numbers for because those profits look * not bad * . 
  awkwardly , gallente freighter will likely be changed to only require gallente industrial ** iv ** at the same time as capital ships get changed to only require racial battleship iv . 
  you 'll probably still need it to v to fly an anshar though . 
  whatever happened to that project halibut thing you guys were running ? 
  it woud be good to affiliate it with one training corporation for each faction ( assuming you count eve uni for minmatar ), 
  mods have to bestow it on them first . 
   `` see those miners were part of the resource division of a large corporation , a key money maker for a industrial alliance . '', 
   there are so many things wrong with that statement ... 
  ccp trailers tend to be somewhat * aspirational * . 
  but first , you need someone to write a non-terrible plot . 
  so , never . 
  an * entire season * ? 
  too much : effort :, 
   our ceo makes aura , explosions , and kirith kodachi squee with delight . 
  this one time , at gate camp ... 
  ah , so * that 's * why he 's called ccp soundwave . 
  happy to help . 
  im just happy it 's an early downtime so it wont cut into my play time . 
  sigh , while i do appreciate a smooth rollout , the early deployment has done a number on my plans to camp the hell out of outer ring :(, 
  an industrial expansion . 
  i want [ giant factories in space ] ( http://shipyards.relicnews.com/hw2/images/hw2_comps_06_rc_chimera_station.jpg ) , automated to hell and back , with little npc badgers shuttling goods all over the place , popping out battleships without the wrist-slitting pain of current pos towers . 
  i want it to be ** worth ** manufacturing outside of highsec . 
  well , you certainly ticked all the boxes in your marketing brief . 
  you 're hired !, 
  1.5 g and counting , for me . 
  third party : no . 
  download a patch manually : yes . 
  ro0-afuck its dresden all over again, 
  how is it third party ? 
  first party : you, 
  second party : ccp, 
  third party : ?? 
  consistently good posts . 
  added to my watch list , 
  cooters fill up . 
  ding dongs just go ` flubba flubba ' as they flap around . 
  pretty-much all of them . 
   99 % of the time , the best value for your money when making a new account ( by a long shot ) is to do a buddy invite . 
  not in this case , since you get a standard 14 day trial + 30 days paid playing time , and depending on the deal , some cool trinkets which you will probably sell off , for the grand total of five bucks . 
  i prefer to think of it as renting my friends by the month . 
  thats why you sell before the patch , not after . 
  sure . 
  buy cheap one place , sell for less-than-post-patch-but-still-expensive price in jita . 
  rss readers are a thing , btw . 
  imo damage controls should be passive modules anyway . 
  maybe downtime wouldnt be in the middle of au prime time . 
   do you have an experience with null trading ? 
  i know [ someone who does . 
  ] ( http://k162space.com/2012/11/02/high-volume-pvp-items/ ) . . 
  the reason they use so little cap and have such long cycle times was because at the time they were released , only active modules could be restricted to only one per ship . 
  ccp would have made it passive if their code had allowed it at the time . 
  that 's a different topic ( i.e. 
  better api access ) . 
  this topic is about other games in the eve universe , or eve on different platforms . 
  kinda like nvidia demoing eve on a tablet pc , or dust or whatever . 
  * [ which barge ] ( http://serpentinelogic.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/new-mining-barges-an-indepth-look/ ), 
  * [ what to mine today ] ( http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/ ) ( look for what 's available in whichever system you 're in - presumably high sec ) bear in mind that isogen is suspiciously high this week . 
  suggested skills to train will be listed under the ` recommended certificates ' tab when you view info on a ship type . 
  in addition , you 'll need to meet the skill prerequisites to even fit the relevant modules , so you 'll be halfway there already . 
  they reduce damage a bit , really you only need your shields to last long enough for your drones to do their thing . 
  the rigs are also quite cheap , which is nice . 
  i built a few hundred procurers for about 1.2 m isk each . 
  others built tens of thousands . 
  build cost is now about 25m isk so i expect not a lot of new ones will be built until those massive stockpiles run out in 2 year 's time . 
  protip : ore frigate iv is * still * as good as an unbonused 5-turret ship . 
  also that utility high is for the cloak , 
  especially good for t2 gallente , who still have high thermal and kinetic resists even after the explosive hole is plugged . 
  do everything in high sec , jump freighter it into null . 
  you 're in dawww , i 'm sure there 's jump freighter services available to you . 
  last time i was in sov null , prices were 220isk/m ^ 3 for each cyno needed , which is miniscule if you 're transporting modules . 
  t1 ammunition : import . 
  emp l retails at 200 isk/unit in jita , but import costs are probably only 5-7isk / unit via jump freighter . 
  t1 modules : who uses t1 modules ? 
  t2 modules : you ca n't build them without t2 materials , which are built from t2 reactants from all over the map . 
  to get these t2 mats you 'll need to trade for them , which means highsec , so just skip the whole problem and build everything in highsec . 
  t1 ships : where are you going to get enough minerals to make them ? 
  you 'll have to buy a lot . 
  oh wait , that involves trade , so you 'll be in a market hub anyway .
