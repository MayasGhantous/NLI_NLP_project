  if you can get one extra racial battlecruiser skill for free , that 's a small victory anyway . 
  ( ideally you 'll be able to get destroyers iv or v and all the racial frigates to iii , which is much more achievable and painless than training battlecruisers v and all racial cruisers ) . 
  if you 're going to choose additional racial cruisers , i suggest training gallente , or amarr . 
  choosing gallente puts you closer to the angel pirate ships ; amarr puts you closer to the blood raider ships ( but they 're all armor tanked so it will be a long while before you can capitalize on that ),

  well all the people who got an unfriendly welcome arent voting in thepoll are they ? 
  the eminem of his generation . 
  you mean , besides the obvious ? 
  yes thats correct . 
  battleships are expensive and get hit harder than battlecruisers . 
  if you can afford to replace the battleship a couple times , feel free , but generally its better to use a harbinger with t2 pulses than an armageddon with t1 unless the guns are the only thing youre missing ie you have all support skills trained up .

  i 's been belt ratting in a ( pvp fit ) talos lately . 
  holy shit . 
  hot knife through butter . 
  you do n't need dual webs on this fit . 
  you do need more tank , and you have the grid spare to fit an lse without difficulty . 
  bad fit , -1 . 
  why would an assault frigate take on a drone ship in the first place ? 
  * maybe * 10m . 
  syndicate is terrible for ratting anyway . 
  you could try a [ kiting talwar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/comments/14pis9/f_talwar_kiting/ ) .

  well , * one of * them is terribly wrong , 
  why not just transport the minerals to where you need it , then build it there ? 
  if you only do occasional hauling , the amarr industrials are the best value at skill level i. 
  if you want the best hauling for your skill points , the minmatar mammoth is the best hauler , since it 's almost as good as the iteron v but only requires minmatar industrial iv . 
  if you like to haul lots of stuff in a very flimsy ship , get the iteron v . it carries a huge amount but is still very fragile . 
  i had it explained to me as `` you only like oral '' . 
  i lied ; it 's 4m10s with thorium and 2m50s with cnam . 
  capping out in 12 seconds seems a bit bad though ? 
  armor tanking allows you to fit extra omnidirectional tracking links and target painters though ... 
  that 's as may be , but null l is incredible , no joke . 
  and since i have t2 large blasters , mise well use them . 
  indeed . 
  when you spend 300 million dollars like sw : tor did , you need lots of subscribers , and for a long time to recoup that .

  a 6-launcher hml tengu still does 664dps out to 70km with scourge fury with 2xcnbcs ( down from ~ 770 dps @ 100km or so ), 
  a 5-launcher hml tengu does 522 dps ( down from ~ 550 ), 
  it 's a slight nerf but quite reasonable . 
  ( by contrast , a 6-launcher hamgu can put out 981dps @ 25km with scourge rage , which is pretty reasonable ),

  perhaps best to use a 21-day trial first , in case you do n't like the game . 
  i sold the booster for 100m isk , and the ship for ~ 200m isk , so that 's, 
  * $ 5 for 14 +30 days playing time + 300m isk, 
  compared to a 21-day trial + one month subscription , i.e. 
  * $ 15 for 21 +30 days playing time + ~ 300m isk from your buddy, 
  ergo get the $ 5 deal . 
  in fact , get an extra one and hand it out to a friend , 
  test alliance even has a 30 day newbie skill plan . 
  its pvp focused but better than no plan at all . 
  test alliance please ignore is the alliance controlled by dreddit , the largest reddit coporation . 
  theyre the largest alliance in eve , at present . 
  get in legion , run incursions ?
