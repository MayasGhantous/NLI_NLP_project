how many palestinian children have died from israeli bombs , or less directly from insufficient medicine and terrible living conditions ? 
  please explain how the death of one child is acceptable , but not the other ? 
  heinz 's marketing company : `` this will go viral . 
  it will be on facebook , 9gag and digg before you know it . 
  might even make reddit ... '', 
  well that was significantly less funny than i expected . 
  i imagined a bunch of hipsters dressed in gulag uniforms and stuff . 
  not just normal hipsters being organised in a stalinist manner by the government . 
  everything in russia is swinging back to stalinism now , why would art - or even hipsters - be any different ? 
  ha ha ha , that 's fucking hilarious . 
  bullshit propaganda that , despite being about how none were used , actually admits to a couple of the `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' the cia is being criticised for ( eg lying about family members , uncomfortable constraints ) , all wrapped up in a 24 fantasy . 
  not appropriate for this sub though really , is it ? 
  i decided to no longer comment in this sub upon the palestinian occupation due to the paid israeli shills , but this is different ... 
  it 's fucking hilarious . 
  nor by many of the other techniques listed in the cia report . 
  lying * about * family members is directly included in the catalogue of cia `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' - eg , your wife 's a whore or your children are dying and need you ... 
  exactly as in this work of fiction !, 
  edit : in fact this is 100 % directly analogous to, 
   we 're going to cut your mother 's throat, 
  no , you 're right . 
  torture is not effective and even if it was it would n't be acceptable . 
  this is clearly fictionalised , however . 
  just parse the writing * style * - it 's straight out of the pages of a bad thriller . 
  all the cliches and tropes are there ... 
  that 's just a standard police tactic - google `` the prisoner 's dilemma '' ... 
  looks exactly like beavis ... 
  i expected to see dead cop from the title ... 
  we 've had this conversation . 
  you 're a troll . 
  edit : you proved it when you refused to answer my calling you out , that 's exactly what trolls do . 
  but go ahead and answer this comment so you do n't * look * a troll , troll ... 
  wtf ? 
  how is that answering anything ? 
  here i can do it too : / u/computer _ name, 
  so i guess that really put you in your place , huh ? 
  edit : will you please stop following me around , downvoting me just because you dislike my username ? 
  we 're not talking about economic theory here though , but police/cia/shin bet interrogation tactics . 
  sorry , maybe the prisoner 's dilemma was n't quite appropriate given that we are n't talking about economics and that is the context in which it 's employed phrased thusly . 
  i just wanted to illustrate that getting two prisoners to trade each other off against their captors a very well known and common technique that is universally employed ... 
  that 's pretty interesting analysis man , 
  i never realised shrek was a meth-head . 
  kind of explains a lot though i guess ... 
  that 's actually genetic apparently . 
  i 'm the same man ... 
  do i * really * need to explain why ? 
  just google `` genetic dislike for cilantro '' ( or coriander outside the americas ) , loads of links come up . 
  [ here 's the first ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/soapy-taste-of-coriander-linked-to-genetic-variants-1.11398 ), 
  lol , you 're a bit of a hero in my eyes - i ca n't bear to eat it . 
  both my parents like it fine , i guess it 's a recessive gene ? 
  pics or it did n't happen ... 
  who surgically removed your sense of humour ? 
  was it dr mengeles ? 
  he 's saying the blindreader software needs a redesign , not reddit . 
  sites can be redesigned to be more accessible , although i 've no doubt that reddit meets the standards already . 
  doing so involves the proper use of things like headers and alternative text for images as two very basic examples ... 
  well naples has had massive problems to do with the camorra 's dumping of garbage there , but still i think google could have been a little kinder ... 
  to get you started that was of course during the reign of henry viii , who fought battles against france and scotland . 
  1540s was more scotland i believe . 
  it was a transitional period between days of chivalry and modern warfare . 
  i do n't think henry maintained a standing army so your ancestor would have most likely signed on per campaign . 
  his economic status could have varied hugely , but as a private soldier he obviously would have not have been that high status , at least at that point in his life . 
  it would be good if you could provide an image of the document - even here people might well be able to help , but / r/askhistorians would be much better for that !, 
  that 's really interesting stuff , good luck finding out more . 
  this should be x-posted to / r/anormaldayinrussia , with the title of `` just your average russian cat burglar '' or something along those lines ... 
  branding is traditionally done to animals ... 
  he should have covered off saline forehead doughnuts , or [ bagelhead implants ] ( http://www.lacarmina.com/blog/2012/10/bagel-head-trend-japan-truth-japanese-bagelheads-website-saline-forehead-inflation-donut-taboo/ ) , the classic [ horn implants ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/meet-terrifying-devil-man-black-4451864 ) and charming [ metal mohawk ] ( http://www.zentastic.com/blog/2012/07/26/the-transdermal-implants-of-samppa-von-cyborg/ ) to be safe in terms non-traditional pet mods ... 
  coz you 're a hipster ? 
  or a sadist ? 
  he looks like paddington bear from the movie !, 
  damn cute , 
  where is it located now ? 
  i was at the archaeological museum in athens just a couple of days ago where they had no hoplite helmets on view at all , much to my disappointment . 
  several rooms were n't open so those kinds of things may have been there , just not viewable while i was :(, 
  of course there was a bunch of other great stuff so it 's not the end of the world , but if it 's in athens i 'd like to see it whilst i 'm here ... 
  i ran ( so far away ), 
  vagina ... penis ... 
  am i right ? 
  dammit , drove past the sign for olympia , but do n't have time to go there . 
  oh well , thanks anyway . 
  snob . 
  who made you the queen of england ? 
  i think you just de-creepified it good op ... 
  and i 'm sure that was a repost too ... 
  huh , i 'd owe money . 
  that 's what i get for trying to use reason in / r/worldnews threads about israel and palestine ... 
  it 's all the alt accounts that constitute manipulation of social media . 
  glad you 're owning up ... 
  then i apologise to you ; however , if you read thru op 's comment history you will notice he * only * comments in / r/worldnews and solely on the conflict between israel and palestine ... 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/ ) may help you understand why such accounts make me suspicious . 
  with ships i think it 's because people live within them ( as a child in the womb ) and because they provide warmth and protection in a hostile environment . 
  the other context you often hear it is people saying , about their car or something similar perhaps , that `` she 's a real beauty '' . 
  that just would n't sound right with `` he '' . 
  great answer . 
  covered etymology and history , but started with a joke !, 
  well in the instance i mentioned i think it sounds right because beauty is more of a female attribute . 
  i see your point though . 
  drinking is normal thing . 
  all people do it . 
  heroin is just to keep warm in cold winters . 
  injecting marijuanas is bad thing .
