  have a nice day too . 
  stay safe . 
  yes , not all zionist immigration was illegal ; however , * as i made perfectly clear * , i was referring specifically to the immediate post-wwii wave of people smugglers bringing illegal immigrants into palestine . 
  this was when the bulk of proto-israelis entered palestine prior to their instigation of the civil war . 
  following your reasoning that the queue jumping was ok , would you agree syrians now have the right to move out of syria to avoid persecution and death - into israel , for example ? 
  if not , why not ? 
  i. did . 
  not . 
  say . 
  you . 
  said . 
  it : i have been saying that your comments have all been arguing that * the guy who did say it * was right . 
  it 's a subtle , but distinct difference you seem to have trouble grasping . 
  i do n't agree with the stabbing attacks , but to call them a `` fad '' is your deeply-grained racism showing itself yet again . 
  it 's also incredibly facile . 
  ergo your introduction of hamas tv * is * a whataboutism . 
  i 'm not a leftist . 
  in my country i vote centre-right . 
  in the extreme right-wing hothouse of israeli politics i would no doubt be considered `` a leftist '' , just because i do n't believe any race is intrinsically superior to any other . 
  instead of providing any indication that you actually believe that `` yes '' instead you immediately go on to say a massive `` but '' ... 
  can you provide a source for a palestinian state immediately declaring war on israel ? 
  are you really so scared of a country that does n't yet exist and that wo n't have an army , navy or air force when it does ? 
  i do n't think i have a better perspective than you , just that i have a different perspective you would benefit from learning from . 
  with you everything is so black and white - palestinians are all natural born terrorists , hell-bent on destroying the noble jews of israel . 
  you completely discount their circumstances and the massive injustices done to them . 
  when i said `` passed through '' it was a tiny bit of an exaggeration for effect , but the israelites only ruled a united israel from approximately 1000bc - 732bc . 
  thes rest of the time the jews were no longer dominant , until the 1st century ad when they quite foolishly refused to pay roman taxes , ridiculously decided to rebel and were predictably defeated and exiled . 
  there was then ** no ** effort made to return until two thousand years later - longer than the jews actually lived in palestine as a people !, 
  the area was not `` up for grabs '' in the minds of anyone except the zionists . 
  it * should * have followed the normal post-colonial course of the locals being handed control ; instead the zionists started a civil war and then took what they wanted before the un deal was even complete . 
  we 're just going round in circles here , you take it easy and stay safe . 
  smh . 
  so * everywhere else in the world * the native inhabitants were given control of their own countries , except for palestine which - luckily for the zionists and their colonialist project - was `` up for grabs '' ? 
  so what was different about palestine , other than the colonial dream of herzl et al ? 
  how come * all the other former colonies * were n't `` up for grabs '' from whatever marauding band on neo-colonial foreign invaders who felt like scooping them up ? 
  you really do n't see the palestinians as having natural human rights , do you ? 
  no , half of their land was offered to a bunch of motley foreigners for no good reason and they were told they could keep the other half - what a great deal !, 
  gee , i wonder why they did n't accept that ? 
  sure they had purchased some plots ; however , purchasing land does not confer sovereignty . 
  this is the same bs that keeps the settlements expanding and results in israelis getting stabbed ... 
  please read something that does n't originate from the israeli propaganda factories , think about it and then ask me more questions . 
  it 's been fun , but honestly i think i have provided you with enough education for now . 
   smug pricks, 
  tsk tsk , no need to go ad hominem . 
  people only attack the man when they ca n't attack the argument ... 
  i guess ad hominem * was * your only option . 
  carry on . 
  you thought that was smug ? 
  sorry , i did n't mean to come across like that . 
  i am happy to edit my comment if you would like ? 
  i really would just like you to absorb enough of the counterpoints to israel 's version of events to be able to gain sufficient empathy to put yourself in the shoes of `` the other '' and consider the issues holistically . 
  by the other i mean the palestinians themselves as well as mainstream world opinion such as i represent . 
  i can understand and express all of the pro-israeli arguments and even empathise with all but the most bigoted of them . 
  i do n't think it 's black and white or that israel is entirely in the wrong . 
  i can understand the impetus for a jewish homeland and get why herzl picked on palestine . 
  i do n't think the palestinians are perfect and lament their crimes against israel too . 
  unfortunately , in discussions such as ours there is no room for give and take because every pro-israeli commenter refuses to concede * any * unfairness or misbehaviours by israel or inherent within the zionist project . 
  it is as if you guys believe that any admission of israeli misbehaviour totally delegitimises israel , which obviously is not the case and any criticism indicates a desire to destroy israel . 
  again , not true . 
  if there was anyone saying the palestinians are justified stabbing civilians or being blatantly anti-semitic i would argue with them just as resolutely . 
  ultimately their will be no peace until both sides see each other as human fucking beings with rights equal to their own . 
  the pro-israel narrative is so concretely embedded in the minds of people brought up with no other lens to view the situation through and then repeated here so vociferously and inflexibly that it is important and necessary that some people , like me , say `` ok , but hang on a minute - have you thought about * this * ? '', 
  i 'll say it again : i ** 100 % ** support israeli self-determination . 
  i am not your enemy , just a believer in free and open discussion . 
  you just do not gaf , do you ? 
  israel has killed many times the number of casualties it has suffered and has been the aggressor just as much as the victim . 
  your version of history is irreparably distorted by your cherry picking of which wars you even acknowledge and then further by your mental gymnastics around the sequence of events , causes and outcomes of literally everything that has happened . 
  you absolutely refuse to acknowledge that the palestinians have any legitimate grounds for grievance : it seems you believe that just by imagining what they thought would be a good idea , herzl magically bestowed an indisputable , natural right to palestine on the zionists , apropos of nothing . 
  no other reason than `` we need somewhere to feel safe - we want here '' ... 
  every pro-israeli argument simply ignores that the people of palestine are just like people everywhere , entitled to the same rights because zionist ideology claims that their special snowflake status utterly supersedes those rights for the indigenous population of the safe space they want and have bestowed upon themselves . 
  every pro-israeli argument is ultimately backed ** only ** by the zionists ' self-proclaimed inviolable , special snowflake , protected at all costs endangered species status ; that is what every apology for israel 's crimes devolves to if you peel back the layers of bs justification surrounding it . 
  if the iaf are such humane , precision killers why did they just this week kill sibling children in retaliation for four rockets being fired that hit * nothing * ? 
  there are thousands of similar examples , why are they all ok and not war crimes ? 
  because special snowflake , that 's why . 
  israel only acknowledges validity of its own courts ' decisions , despite those being at odds with every other legal opinion or ruling , ever . 
  israel exonerates itself of everything and tells the world its hands are clean , but refuses to face the icc or icj . 
  the un is anti-semitic so should be ignored , except for certain resolutions that are right and binding ( the ones that back up israel 's view of things ) ... ditto for international law : israel ignores any ruling it pleases , then threatens to take the eu to court for its internal , technical policies on accurate product labelling . 
  netanyahu threatens to bomb iran ( with israel 's illegal nuclear arsenal the big stick he holds ) even after iran signs an international treaty dismantling its nuclear program , but iran is still the villain . 
  why ? 
  special snowflake , that 's why . 
  i 'm not palestinian , i 'm anglo . 
  my views are those of the world outside israel 's echo chamber of paranoid delusional fears and self-serving excuses . 
  so much hate in your wall of text . 
  a sociopathic disdain and utter lack of empathy all triggered because someone dared express an opinion that challenges the false narrative you push . 
  poor little special snowflake , ego bruised and trembling with fear from the nasty words that dispute your right to do whatever , whenever to whoever . 
  so many lies in your wall of text . 
  semantic games , whataboutisms , strawmen and dissimulations all stitched together into a quilt of steaming bs . 
  you obviously truly believe in your moral and essential superiority to these palestinians you 're trying so hard to upset and make cry like you do . 
  i 'm actually australian . 
  criticise australia if you like : for most things you could possibly say i will probably agree with you , but also be able to prove how we work at being and doing better - something you refuse to acknowledge you might have any need to even consider . 
  i said if you did n't filter the bigotry i 'd not bother replying , well you just crossed the line so grossly that i am going to have to hold true to that . 
  i have tried to engage you in conversation and simply asked that you allow yourself just a little mental flexibility so we could have an actual discussion , but your programming is too strong and you clearly find accepting any thought that does not completely align with your false self-righteousness too threatening to even contemplate . 
  edit : wait , that wall of text is n't even your own oc , just a literal pasting from that hate speech blog ? 
  i guess , luckily , it just encapsulated your own views so perfectly that there was no need to actually write anything yourself ... 
  this just proves my point : incapable of critical thought , you get all your opinions prepackaged and then just spew them out when triggered . 
  that 's why you ca n't think outside your box - for you , thinking ' for schmucks , is n't it ? 
  try again when you can say something original , logically and morally consistent that you can support with evidence and defend in discussion without resorting to semantics , strawmen , dissimulations or whataboutisms . 
   and i 'm from wisconsin . 
  australian settlers did far worse things to the aboriginals than israel ever did to the palestinians . 
  hell , they were literally hunted to extinction on tasmania .
