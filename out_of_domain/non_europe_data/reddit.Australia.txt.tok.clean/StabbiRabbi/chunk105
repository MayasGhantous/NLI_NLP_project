   with germany and italy eyeing multi-billion dollar projects in iran , i doubt it . 
  no , the israeli government will destroy this loyal soldier 's home simply because he is bedouin despite european investment in iran . 
  in fact the issues seem , on the surface at least , to be completely unrelated !, 
  yes , that is precisely what i was talking about . 
  this move is hardly likely to encourage them to change that state of affairs , is it ? 
  you catch more flies with honey than vinegar . 
  cool , thx man . 
  i really would be interested - you do n't often get to see that kind of thing , people boasting about being fucking evil ... 
  chilling , heavy stuff i imagine ? 
  yeah , but clams are n't people ... 
  tmnt - did it teach you * nothing * ? 
  jonathan is a tortoise though , not a turtle . 
  it 's complicated . 
  philosophy . 
  metaphysics . 
  are you expert in all those fields ? 
  if not the whole thing is probably too much for you take onboard . 
  no ariborne units deployed to ` nam !, 
  i wonder if that crazy genie can be put back in its bottle now its been let out ? 
  or will roving bands of disaffected trumpians ( trumpeters ? 
  what * is * the collective noun for a group of trump fans anyway ? ), 
  roam the highways and byways of the usa for years to come , terrorising sikhs and building ceremonial walls to quote from his speeches and worship his image in front of for years to come ... ? 
  ( i actually see this scenario playing out whether he wins or not tbh , for how might any man live up to the shimmering promise of making america great again holds up ? 
  without full dictatorial powers of course ... ), 
  why centipedes ? 
  i get the insect analogy , but i would have thought cockroaches or dung beetles would be more appropriate ... 
  puffy nips, 
  [ mark berent ] ( http://www.markberent.com/about.htm ) is really good for that kind of military pilot fiction . 
  during his first tour in sea he flew f-100s ( and o-1 facs in his spare time ! ), 
  out of bien hoa , rvn . 
  his next tour was f-4ds out of ubon as squadron leader of the 8th tfw 's ( robin old 's `` wolf pack '' wing ) famous 497th tfs `` night owls '' , the only f-4 unit to fly strike/fast-fac missions over the ho chi minh trail at night . 
  finally he served as us air attache in cambodia - this man knows the usaf vietnam war experience inside out !, 
  there are five books in his `` rolling thunder '' series , which follow the adventures of a usaf fast jet pilot and his friends ( including a fac pilot and a macv-sog green beret ) through the vietnam war years , very much on a par with `` flight of the intruder '' in terms of realism and quality of writing . 
  many of the events that happen to his characters have obvious roots in real events from the period that anyone who is reasonably knowledgeable about the war will recognise and whilst his characters do pull some `` interesting '' missions they are much more grounded in fact than the later coonts books or anything from dale brown & etc. 
  the books can be picked up pretty cheaply as ebooks - i * think * `` rolling thunder '' ( the first in series ) may even be free to download on kindle , to suck you in to buying the rest i guess ha ha . 
  your reasoning is sound , but does n't quite capture the reality of the situation . 
  remember you wear your shell to protect not constrain you . 
  you are too concerned with the outward manifestations of what is person . 
  remember the maxim `` i think , therefore i am '' . 
  you are right to focus on happiness as a deliminator of person/not-person , but your thoughts are corrupted by materialist misunderstandings : generally , people misconstrue the source of happiness . 
  they think by pleasing their insatiable desire they can be happy . 
  they do not realize that the means available to them to please their desires are limited by time and space . 
  jonathon otoh has obviously learned this lesson and is thus perhaps more of a people than you are - yet ... 
  actually , the 173d airborne bde ( separate ) performed a mass combat jump as part of [ operation junction city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_junction_city ) in ' 67 . 
  what i mean was that no * ariborne * units deployed to vietnam !, 
  in terms of * airborne * forces , however , as well as the aforementioned 173d abn bde , the entire 101st abn div was deployed ( although it changed tasking to become an airmobile division during the course of the war ... ) and finally the 3d bde of the 82d abn div also saw action . 
  actually the 173d abn bde ( sep ) performed a mass combat jump during 1967 's [ operation junction city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_junction_city ) ... 
  what i meant was no * ariborne * units were deployed . 
  in fact , the us military does n't even possess any ariborne formations !, 
  there were also a number of combat jumps performed by macv-sog green berets and their indigenous colleagues , including the [ first ever combat halo jump ] ( http://specialoperations.com/29014/worlds-first-combat-h-l-o-jump/ ) , by a reconaissance team going `` over the fence '' into laos ... 
  [ this is a list of all acknowledged us military combat jumps that lists both the 173d 's junction city jump and the macv-sog jumps that were made in the course of the war ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/airborne-jumps.htm ) . 
  it was just a silly joke - the op to whom i replied misspelled `` airborne '' as `` ariborne '' . 
  no `` ariborne '' units were deployed to vietnam because obviously there is no such thing !, 
  it was just a dumb play on words . 
  to make up for it [ have a list of all acknowledged us military combat jumps ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/airborne-jumps.htm ) , including those in vietnam by both the 173d and macv-sog recon teams into laos ( including the first combat halo jump !, 
  ) , in case you 're interested . 
  that would actually be an improvement over bombing entire random palestinian families , yes . 
  there * would * be far fewer casualties that way . 
  actually , it would still be a significant story . 
  the story is israel 's creeping annexation . 
  tiny nibbles * are * the story . 
  i was thinking of the siblings killed last week actually ... 
  so they just happened to die from natural causes at the same time ? 
  or something ? 
  ah , so israel * did * bomb them , but it does n't count ? 
  is that it ? 
  so they just happened to die from natural causes at the same time ... ? 
  see how we 're going around in circles . 
  israel dropped a bomb that killed them . 
  does that satisfy your craving for semantic specificity ? 
   as far as i 'm concerned , they were killed by fragments of palestinian rockets that exploded, 
  riiiight . 
  you do understand though that in a purely literal sense it was an israeli air force dropped bomb that ended their lives , do n't you ? 
  in any case , this talk of rockets and other excuses are irrelevant to the discussion at hand : you asked if it would be better if israelis stabbed palestinians and i said yes , that * would * be preferable to bombs being dropped that killed whole families ... 
  so it 's ok because they were palestinians and some other palestinians launched some rockets that exploded harmlessly in a field and ( i think this is what probably * really * led to the childrens ' ~ ~ murder ~ ~ completely justified death by bombing ) some different palestinians again * dared to interrupt big brother israel * !, 
  collective punishment doctrine : excusing * everything * since ' 48 !, 
   i 'm glad to be supporting the side which does n't encourage it 's kids to intentionally murder civilians, 
  a ) i do n't support either side , but rather finding a solution . 
  i have made my support for israel 's continued existence and right to self-determination very clear , only wanting palestine to enjoy the same . 
  terrible of me i know , but there it is ;, 
  b ) israeli children are certainly being taught to hate the palestinians . 
  numerous polls prove this ( including the recent , very revelatory pew report , but also many others ) , indicating that israel , uniquely amongst developed nations , has more right-wing than left-wing high school students and , again uniquely , the right-wing percentage is growing . 
  these right-wing israeli kids will , in a few short years , be the idf troops `` enforcing the law '' ( my sides ! ), 
  in the wb . 
  they do n't need to be `` encouraged to * intentionally * murder civilians '' : soon enough they will be * ordered * to involve themselves in the collective punishment of all palestinians in gross over-responses to any dissent from the oppressed people of the occupied territories . 
  the net effect is the same . 
  that was a funny place to slice out a misquote . 
  the key concept in that sentence was `` collective punishment '' : perhaps you 're projecting * just a little * ? 
  sorry , you 're quite right : i meant i support * both * sides , not i do n't support either . 
  good catch . 
  always a pleasure , see you next time . 
  stay safe . 
  if any of the wb * is * under israeli sovereignty then apartheid is most definitely applicable . 
  the fig leaf of it being a `` citizenship issue '' is immediately stripped away once israel claims sovereignty rather than that they are an occupying power - two different rule systems for persons under their sovereignty is the very definition of apartheid ... 
  what is going on is annexation by way of `` death by a thousand cuts '' ; perhaps in practical terms nobody does much care for this particular little patch of desert , but it is the creeping annexation - slice by tiny slice - to which people take exception . 
  now , this does ** not ** justify anti-semitism in any sense , to any degree ; however , it does engender anger at israel , both for the `` big picture '' of palestine being slowly consumed and the cynical policy of trying to mask this by only taking small enough pieces at any one time that apologists can rise up to cry out `` it 's just a square mile of unused desert '' , as if that somehow changes the principle involved or the rest of the world is too stupid to notice/too uncaring to disapprove . 
  claiming that the outcry over this is simply about this particular square mile is either disingenuous or a clear sign you 've `` drunk your own koolaid '' ( as it were ) . 
  i understand that mondoweiss 's authors are disparaged by many in the pro-israel camp as `` self-hating jews '' ( ugh , i hate that trope ... ) , but please get past that and read [ this analysis of israel 's annexation policy ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2016/03/netanyahu-govt-is-implementing-annexation-of-west-bank-as-secret-but-official-policy/ ) for the wb . 
  even if you disagree with the article it ca n't do any harm to gain a look at things from the other side , surely ? 
  ( personally i read widely from both sides of the fence , as much from israeli publications and authors - eg michael oren , mainstream israeli media - as i do from sites like mondoweiss and authors like finkelstein , chomsky and fisk ; all i wo n't read is hate speech of any origin ... ),
