  certainly some criticism of israel and the occupation of the wb and gaza is motivated by nothing more than a desire in the primitive minds of anti-semite arseholes to attack the jewish state , but there are also genuine moral and humanitarian concerns that should be aired , discussed and addressed too . 
  this case , from the original story to their intransigence over publishing a correction and failure to apologise definitely feels more than a little off , but not all criticism of israel per se is anti-semitically motivated . 
  the un only formulated the legal basis for israel 's creation * purely so they could subsequently * *** unfairly *** * criticise the state they just helped create * . 
  this fact is well-known in pro-israeli circlejerking circles . 
  so what about the other 670,000 expelled by israel in ' 48 ? 
  is 30000 the number still living ? 
  do you have a source for that figure ? 
  how are their descendants * not * palestinian refugees anyway ? 
  many still live in refugee camps . 
  they are still palestinians . 
  people who are palestinian and live in refugee camps are , fyi , palestinian refugees ... 
  you 're perfectly correct , of course . 
  it irritates me when people get such basic facts wrong in threads like this - the waters are muddied enough already by the inherent complexity of the situation and both sides disinformation campaigns . 
  people saying things that are just plain wrong such as the occupation is illegal per se are contributing nothing useful to the discussion . 
  although i have not lived in israel , nor even yet been lucky enough to visit , i share your position entirely . 
  supporting israel 's right to exist and enjoy self-determination whilst wishing the same for the palestinians are not mutually exclusive positions , or imo even slightly contradictory . 
  in fact i too believe israel would ultimately be much better off if they withdrew from the wb , but also made such concessions on equitable land-swaps ( for the largest settlements that would be too hard to quit ) , reparations and a * limited * right of return for some palestinian refugees ( without being anywhere near enough to compromise the jewish majority - that being unthinkable to all israelis and absolutely politically unacceptable as a result ... ) in return for security safeguards as would be necessary to secure a two-state solution peace deal . 
  the palestinians did not conquer palestine from the israelites . 
  the israelites only ruled a unified israel for 270 yrs , between 1000 bc and 730 bc . 
  ( so ** 3000 ** years ago ! ), 
  after that many different empires ruled the land until the jews rather stupidly rebelled against rome and , predictably enough , were defeated and expelled ... 
  subsequently no serious effort , or even thought , was given to moving back until the 1880s with herzl 's `` der judenstaat '' and the first aaliyah . 
  in any case the law as it was in '67 ( and thus applies to the occupied territories ) is radically different from ancient or even just pre-wwii international law . 
  your argument is not clever and reveals only your lack of knowledge and understanding , not some brilliant argument that once and for settles the question of how criminal is israel 's behaviour . 
  please read some books . 
  i read finkelstein more than chomsky , though chomsky * is * indubitably a very smart man . 
  ( especially when he 's writing in his actual , academic fields . ), 
  finkelstein has made very clear his refusal to support the bds movement because of their deplorable ultimate goal of israel 's destruction . 
  that 's why it baffles me when people call him a self-hating jew - it seems like such a cheap shot . 
  would n't that be so much simpler ? 
  i * like * the objective truth and will always happily adjust my views when i am shown any indisputable example of such . 
  the issue with rubbish like `` illegal occupation '' is how difficult such emotive babble makes sifting the objective truth out from all the noise , especially for people who are just learning about what is a complex and highly charged topic . 
  i 'm sure it does exist too , people will internalise abuse directed at them for `` what `` they are , rather than `` who '' , and go to great lengths to refute that `` what '' , but i disagree with it being bandied about as a tired stereotype to disparage those who the term 's user happens to disagree with . 
  as you say i doubt it is very common ; most people are naturally and rightly proud of their background , whoever they are . 
  if your family history is deep connections to something intrinsically evil obviously that hopefully does n't apply , but you have to be pretty messed up to confuse being a jew with being something intrinsically evil !, 
  it 's ok to disagree and it 's healthy to be able to discuss it like adults . 
  that is , after all , how one expands one 's knowledge and understanding . 
  adults can deal with things not always being black and white . 
  you 've said something like that before , but my username refers to the [ sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ) , a sect of fundamentalist jews from the roman era who were effectively the world 's first terrorist group , pre dating the assassins by about a millennia . 
  they would stab their victims - usually other jews who did not subscribe to their exact beliefs - very publicly to cause terror . 
  eventually they took on the romans and ended up atop herod 's palace at a place called masada , where flavius josephus claims they committed suicide en masse to escape capture and enslavement , though the archaeological evidence suggests they surrendered ... 
  they were literal stabby rabbis . 
  i had thought the meaning reasonably easy to infer as a commentary on the cyclical nature of violence , but i guess most people do n't know their history well enough or just see a username they consider `` inflammatory '' and their brains turn to mush . 
  idk , maybe i was trying to be too clever , expecting too much ... 
  if i could have a do over i would choose something different tbh . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  most were driven from their villages by the haganah then not allowed to return . 
  the haganah publicised a couple of major massacres - usually committed by irgun or stern gang `` troops '' - notably at deir yassin and lydda then preceded their entry into arab villages with heavy mortar bombardments . 
  there were never any arab broadcasts to ask people to leave temporarily , indeed the arab leaders urged them to stay put . 
  meanwhile the haganah commanders would play psywar recordings from loudspeakers on jeeps outside the village . 
  a climate of fear was deliberately created by the jewish forces - * that * is why they fled . 
  edit : grammar, 
  so do you consider any criticism of israel anti-semitic - even if it comes from a fellow jew , or a zionist westerner such as myself ( zionist in that i 100 % support israel 's right to existence and self-determination ) ? 
  are the intellectuals i mentioned , in your eyes , self - hating jews for questioning israeli policy , even when - like finkelstein - they publicly disavow the bds movement for its goal of destroying israel ? 
  no , they 're very vocal critics to a man , but i still would n't call them self-hating jews !, 
  [ answered already in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4b9832/after_shaming_by_israel_time_corrects_story_that/d181yfv ) . 
  hi , i 'm stabbirabbi and i * do * support israel 's right to existence and self-determination . 
  i think it 's more a case that your analysis of the situation differs from mine , informed as they are by different views of events and biases ( or rather lack thereof in my case ) . 
  how would removing the major irritant in israel 's foreign relations `` virtually guarantee its destruction '' ? 
  did i not suggest that the most significant settlements be allowed to stay in situ , only a relatively small number of refugees be allowed to return and security measures be put in place , certainly until trust was established ? 
  the reparations would be for forfeiting the right of return for the remaining refugees and , you know , the ~ 70 % of historical palestine that now forms israel ... 
  in terms of dead civilians there are many more dead palestinians than israelis , but that is not what it is about anyway . 
  in return israel would get an end to the international odium it suffers due to the occupation ( a state that only worsens year on year ) , improved relations with its neighbours ( from whom it has n't suffered an attack in 43yrs already ! ), 
  and a cessation of conflict with the palestinians . 
  you 'll probably now say `` but the palestinians hate all jews and only want to see all jews dead , israel destroyed '' , but i think in fact things would play out differently following a * fair and equitable peace deal * . 
  in any case it is not `` all jews '' , but israel they are angry at and that is not an irrational loathing such as anti-semitism typically is . 
  zionist terrorism ceased as soon as the political goals were met ; why would the palestinians be any different ? 
  do you think them mindless , rage-filled beasts rather than sentient human beings ? 
  obviously - as i stated before - security guarantee measures would * have * to be put in place ( perhaps international peacekeepers ? 
  ) , but this is not '48 or 2000 and palestinian thinking has evolved since then . 
  israel suffers no existential threat and the palestinians have long-since agreed to recognise israel , as have the other arab states as part of a peace deal . 
  the very laws that are used to criticise israel would also be used to protect her if push comes to shove , but in any case the idf possesses such a huge qualitative advantage over any forces that might try to fight it with nukes to boot that i seriously doubt those laws would ever even require enforcement . 
  peace is in both sides ' best interests - the only people who have anything to fear from peace are religious zealots whose zany beliefs about eretz israel would suffer a death knell from a peace deal !, 
  edit : spelling, 
  i realise that now . 
  as i said i think i was trying to be too clever and were a do-over possible i would choose a different name . 
  i would agree with that definition - it 's pretty unambiguous put in those terms !, 
  to me that sounds like a terribly sad , scarred person , but i am sure they do exist . 
  people , imo , * should * be proud of their culture as long as that pride does n't turn into disdain for outsiders . 
  for anyone to suffer such self-loathing is awful , but for them to turn it outwards to attack others like them is dreadful . 
  i emphatically ** do not ** support or condone ** any ** attacks on civilians by either side !, 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  fatah * have * acknowledged israel 's right to exist . 
  their doing so is simply put * the * single most important precondition for peace and i am not so stupid as to not be fully cognisant of that fact . 
  i did not say there is no animus towards jews , merely that such animus is primarily directed at israelis rather than jews in say australia . 
  again , please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  finally let me say that nobody is truly neutral , including me . 
  i do , however , support equally the right of both israelis and palestinians to sovereignty , self-determination and peace as the central tenet of my beliefs on the matter . 
  what i actually said is i am informed by unbiased sources , living as i do outside the hothouse echo chamber of israeli politics , well justified fear of terrorist attacks and intrinsic racial involvement . 
  i also read * very * widely - michael oren and benny morris as well as finkelstein and fisk , israeli news sources as well as western , history as well as current affairs . 
  the only sources i wo n't touch are hate speech tracts from any hateful bastard . 
  yet again , please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  nope , he has explicitly stated his disagreement with the bds movement . 
  they want to destroy israel , which does not tie in with his beliefs and purpose . 
  he just works to tell the other side of the story to the israeli government 's gpo ( govt . 
  propaganda office ? 
  press office ? ), 
  narrative , particularly with regards to the occupation and misuse of anti-semitism to muzzle questions and criticism . 
  his perspective is informed by his holocaust survivor parents ' horror at the ethnic cleansing aspects of israel 's history , but he is not anti-zionist/israel . 
  he 's still not exactly popular in israeli circles - he 's was banned from entering israel for ten years iirc a few years back !,
