  he 's actually very interesting to read , not any kind of ideologue fanatic at all . 
  even if you disagree with his views you lose nothing by reading his works - just borrow from a library if you 're loath to boost his sales ... 
  i did n't say there were no instructions from any arab leaders for the indigenous population to flee , just that there were no * broadcasts ordering them to * in `` preparation for the coming arab assault '' ( a very common zionist claim and what the commenter i replied to was implicitly referring to ) . 
  this fact was proven by british scholar erskine childers and palestinian scholar walid khalidi in the early '60s from their study of british and american radio monitoring station records . 
  the source you quoted from includes benny morris 's estimation that less than 5 % of refugees fled for such reasons , ie only the natives from only 6 villages !, 
  ( in a segment you cut out without even putting ellipses in place to indicate that any text had been omitted ... ), 
  israel has consistently refused '' [ the saudi initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_peace_initiative ) '' too which has been on the table ** since 2002 ** ... 
  neither `` british '' , `` mandate '' , `` of '' nor `` palestine '' mean `` the place jews are from '' so what * are * you talking about ? 
  since the meanings of the other words are reasonably obvious to anyone who speaks english ( or can write it as you demonstrably can ) it can only be palestine that you 're struggling with . 
  the [ etymology of palestine ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palestine#etymology ) is as follows :, 
   from latin palaest\u012bna ( `` roman province of palestine '' ) , from ancient greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 ( palaist\u00edn\u0113 , `` philistia and the surrounding region '' ) , from hebrew \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea ( p ` l\u00e9shet , `` philistia , land of the philistines '' ) , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] from the root \u05e4 \u05be \u05dc \u05be \u05e9 ( p-l-\u0161 , `` migrate , invade '' ) . 
  [ 3 ] the term p-l-s-t or p-r-s-t , found in five ancient egyptian inscriptions ( beginning with one at medinet habu from circa 1170 bce and ending with padiiset 's statue inscription from circa 900-850 bce ) as the name of a people near egypt , is traditionally taken to be cognate . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] seven assyrian inscriptions contain the word `` palas ( h ) tu '' or `` pilistu '' , which is usually also taken to be cognate . 
  so not `` the place the jews come from '' and not really even english . 
  also it existed * long * before , during and after the ottoman empire ( which , btw , began in the 1400s ... ) and even before the kingdom of israel ( 1000-730 bc ) ; did you just make everything you wrote up , are you simply poorly educated or - as seems most likely - are you just another troll ? 
  in any case please do n't just outright lie . 
  it really does nothing to help the discussion . 
  you did n't ask me , but i think jews should be allowed to live in any future palestinian state , on the condition that they surrender their israeli citizenship and accept palestinian citizenship in lieu , if they want to live there . 
  that seems only fair . 
  i 'd be interested to see them . 
  if you want to ensure there 's a space between two quotation blocks you need to insert a # with a line break either side of it btw , so :,

  nearly that entire thread was all [ deleted ] s from top to bottom . 
  i got to it too late to read the deleted comments , but think i was lucky in that regard . 
  it was supposedly some blood-chilling stuff . 
  that 's what happened next , straight * after * 9/11 ... 
  how remarkably gracious for r/worldnews !, 
  it makes a nice change ... 
  the problem with trying to study what actually happened is exactly what you have just illustrated : literally * everything * is so highly politicised that sorting the wheat from the chaff becomes extremely difficult . 
  finding sources that simply illustrate the events so one may draw one 's own conclusions in next to impossible . 
  whilst it is very easy to find sources that support either side 's argument , sadly it is * very * hard to find reliable , unbiased reportage . 
  a good example is in the quote above about benny morris . 
  morris is held to be somewhat of an israeli apologist ( and certainly not pro-palestinian ) by critics of the israeli narrative , yet in the quote above he is being criticised by israeli scholars for his focus on the israeli perspective ... 
  both views can certainly be true at the same time ; however , the conclusions drawn from those views are entirely orthogonal . 
  personally i try to read as widely ( from both sides ) as i can to at least gain as much of a balanced picture as possible . 
  i 'm always interested in more knowledge and a more complete picture so very much appreciate your effort in looking for actual primary sources as well as your willingness to not try to hammer the closest available square peg into the round hole , as it were . 
  imo the facts have value in and of themselves , quite aside from whether they support my personal views and i will change my views to fit the facts , rather than vice versa as so many others are apt to do . 
  in fact what makes me more annoyed with the debate than almost anything else is people 's tendency ( on both sides ) to treat the truth as an inconvenience as they push their agenda . 
  i personally support the right of both israelis and palestinians to enjoy self-determination , although admittedly , as israel already possesses such , i will usually argue the palestinian case . 
  nonetheless i wo n't deliberately try to claim the palestinians are entirely in the right because clearly that 's neither true nor fair . 
  anyway , nice talking . 
  edit : all of the above is not to deny that i do write very partisan posts - in response to other partisan posts !, 
  however , my genuine preference is for a proper exchange of ideas instead of the slanging matches so prevalent in r/worldnews particularly . 
  i actually find people in r/israel or r/israelpalestine less didactic much of the time and read and comment there for discussion rather than point scoring ( figurative , not imaginary internet points that is ) , as much fun as this sub can be ... 
  a week ? 
  i 'd say they 'd work out something was different before they left the airport . 
  then complain loudly about it . 
  my exact reaction to the title too . 
  whoever would have been the correct usage , rather than whomever , for the second sentence in your initial comment . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.grammarbook.com/grammar/whoever.asp ) is a more thorough explanation of the relevant grammatical rules than i could write myself . 
  i think they were indicating your grammar made them twitch , presumably in discomfort . 
  yep , that 's the way to make people overlook bds 's `` destroy israel '' master plan and make the movement seem reasonable ... 
  the guy is clearly some kind of genius as well as being a moral paragon . 
  ( / s - just in case ... ),

  good job .

  we should simply annex nz and in doing so change theirs to ours . 
  problem solved . 
  then we can also replace their * marmite * with our glorious vegemite !, 
  ( jk kiwis , i 'm actually in nz as i write this and i like your country just as it is - not that i 'd eat marmite though ... ), 
  cincinnatus is definitely the best roman example , but sulla also voluntarily gave up his powers , surprisingly all things considered . 
  of course his hands were * much * bloodier than cincinnatus ( with roman blood ) , but he did end the civil war , restore order and then retire . 
  i still do n't know that i 'd call him a `` good '' dictator though ... 
  stupid long horses . 
  seeds can last for literally millennia . 
  in israel [ ancient judean date palms ] ( http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/extinct-tree-grows-anew-after-archaeologists-dig-ancient-seed-stockpile.html ) were grown from seeds found in a buried jar after being extinct for approximately 1500yrs . 
  even more amazing , the seed vault has apparently been learning a lot from studying [ 32,000 yr old seeds found frozen in siberia ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/02/120221-oldest-seeds-regenerated-plants-science/ ) !, 
  these siberian seeds are particularly useful to study because the seed bank relies on cold storage to preserve their samples . 
  and people say netanyahu and his gang of cronies government lack empathy for the suffering of others ... 
  i believe the legal framework is still in place for nz to join the federation if the so please to this day in fact . 
  yes it is . 
  other commenters elsewhere in the thread have discussed it it greater detail , but cincinnati was named after the society of cincinnatus who obviously took their name from cincinnatus the roman and were inspired by his example . 
  yep , from the imperial period i have a liking for vespasian and his first son , titus ( although not so much domitian ) , too . 
  after the mess nero made of things it was the flavians who picked up the pieces from the collapse of the julio-claudian dynasty 's patchy ( putting it kindly ) rule post-augustus . 
  vespasian embodied traditional roman virtus in many ways and his rule paved the way for the following golden age of imperial rome . 
  augustus fits the `` good dictator '' mould * much * better than octavian ; obviously they are , in a physical sense , one in the same , but in transitioning to augustus from octavian he completely changed his behaviour to become the emperor you describe . 
  obviously as octavian he was driven by the exigencies of circumstance , but the second triumvirate engaged in worse proscriptions than sulla and the civil war between octavian and marc antony was if anything worse than that between sulla and marius . 
  however , once he had dispatched his and his divine father 's enemies then consolidated power as princeps he certainly displayed a genius for effective organisation and administration which allowed him to achieve all that you outline above . 
  oh i agree entirely with your indictment of the proscriptions and the fact he provided a pattern for caesar to aspire to , but i think such developments were perhaps inevitable as rome grew from city state to ( known ) world superpower . 
  the old traditions and rules simply did n't function anymore and sulla was preceded immediately by marius ( who helped him develop his career ) then followed immediately by pompey ( the self-declared `` magnus '' ! ), 
  who he in turn had helped come to power . 
  both pompey and marius also unashamedly broke the mould of republican rome 's tradition , which sulla at least tried to reinstate and secure . 
  i mentioned him mainly because he actually voluntarily surrendered his powers , something marius , pompey , caesar and finally ( for the republic ) octavian never even contemplated for a moment . 
  in that sense he fits into the `` good dictator '' category even if he was ruthlessly sanguineous about it and his efforts to repair the republic ultimately failed , thanks in large part to the example he gave men like caesar . 
  thank you . 
  so , given we * do * have a legal framework for annexation , what 's stopping us ? 
  certainly not the nzdf - i am currently in wanaka for the easter weekend airshow and it seems roughly half the nzaf is here atm . 
  they 're staying in the same lodge as i and i can say without a doubt were all up drinking till about 11:49 pm last night . 
  we should strike while they 're all hungover !, 
  like israel has n't done * exactly * the same thing , not just once or twice , but many , many times . 
  consider all the memorials and honours heaped on heinously criminal and unrepentedly terroristic zionist heroes like ze'ev jabotinsky , menachem begin and yitzhak shamir . 
  two of them were elected pm for fuck 's sake !, 
  how 's * that * for honouring terrorists !, 
  edit : feel free to downvote away if it makes you feel better , but realise it does n't alter reality a whit .
