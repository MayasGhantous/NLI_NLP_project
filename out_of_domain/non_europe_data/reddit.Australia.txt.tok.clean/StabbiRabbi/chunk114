  the potted version is that those guys were the world 's very first terrorists who would assassinate other jews very publicly to cause fear . 
  they were religious fundamentalists who used knives to commit their atrocities - literal stabby rabbis - until they laughably tried to take on the romans and ended up atop masada , a palace of king herod the great . 
  after a long siege by the troops of titus they surrendered into roman slavery . 
  ( at least according to the archaeological record there , although there is some myth put about by historian flavius josephus they killed themselves , that is most likely a fantasy aimed at pleasing his roman patrons ' sense of honour , since no mass burial has been found in decades of digs , besides which their religious code strictly forbade suicide . ), 
  my username is a comment on the cyclical nature of violence and terrorism , i guess most people do n't get the reference though . 
  tbh , if i could have a do-over i 'd probably choose something that requires less education to `` get '' ... 
  that `` palestinians are recent immigrants '' lie has been thoroughly debunked . 
  find a respected , non-israeli ( or internationally respected israeli ) source that proves it . 
  even the direct source of `` a plo leader admitting it '' ( as dubious as such an unsubstantiated , anecdotal quote from a single individual would , in any case , be ) would be a start ... 
  the book most of that theory is based on has been thoroughly proven to be based on grossly misrepresented statistics , academic dishonesty such as plagiarism and outright lies . 
  look at the [ wikipedia article on * from time immemorial * ] (, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_time_immemorial#norman_finkelstein.27s_analysis_of_the_book_as_a_fraud ) - the internationally recognised flaws in the book are clearly detailed . 
  [ dna analysis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinians#dna_and_genetic_studies ) also shows the palestinians are direct descendants of the people indigenous to the region , with some admixture of arab dna dating to the first millennia . 
  this pathetic attempt to not even justify , but actually deny the colonial nature of the zionist project makes sick up in my throat a little . 
  it 's not even necessary - israel exists and is a stable and secure state , it 's self-determination assured not merely by its military forces , nuclear capability and international alliances , but also by the very international laws it scorns in occupied palestine . 
  the * only * reason left to propagate this lie is to justify the ongoing colonisation of the wb , jewish home leader naftali bennett 's `` creeping annexation '' ; for any who are unaware , jewish home is the far-right , extreme zionist , settler party with whom netanyahu has allied himself to form a coalition - the party that features such charming members as cabinet member [ ayelet shaked ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2015/05/netanyahu-palestinians-government/ ) and mk betzalel smotrich ( [ recently famous for his and his wife 's recent racism after - shock - having to give birth next to a palestinian woman ... ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/04/06/world/middleeast/06reuters-israel-racism.html?ref=middleeast&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new%20campaign&amp;utm_term=*morning%20brief&amp;_r=0 ) ) . 
  of course that is the goal of this lie : to make the annexation * appear * morally justifiable . 
  the point is that this is almost exactly the behaviour that jews have been oppressed with in the recent past . 
  the settlements are illegal under international law , what right have they to be there ? 
  unless you genuinely believe the now archaic `` right of conquest '' trumps the post-wwii geneva convention iv which outlaws it , meaning that the wb * is * israeli territory ? 
  be careful there though - if the wb * is * part of israel , and that is what gives the illegal settlers the right to live there and harass the indigenous population , then what we have is 100 % definitely an apartheid state ... 
  so which is it ? 
  what gives these illegal colonists the right to subject the palestinians to the humiliation , poverty and suffering they live with daily , with its uncanny , so darkly ironic it 's like a humour black hole , similarity to how jews have been mistreated in the recent past ? 
  do you really think it 's worth 95/100 ? 
  i found it a bit * too * sherried , as though it was a sherry syrup additive rather than aging in a sherry barrel that gave it its flavour . 
  obviously that 's not the case , but even after letting in breath awhile and adding a dash of h ^ ^ 2 o i still found it a bit sickly . 
  oxygen and water certainly helped , and i finished the bottle , but i never really * liked * it . 
  it definitely did n't live up to the old 16yo . 
  i would n't give the original 16yo a 95/100 though , so perhaps we just use different scales . 
  you 're right morally , but i think he was making a joke - israel is allowing 9000 ethopian jews to make aaliyah in the next few years , it 's been in the news this week . 
  i suspect u/chauncy _ prime is making a joke about the intersection of these two stories within a couple of days of each other . 
  there 's a sub for people who are easily irritated by small noises - r/misophonia . 
  however , [ the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misophonia ) about misophonia is sceptical , calling it a `` purported condition '' and stating it is not classed as either a neurological , psychiatric or audiological disorder . 
  the article then claims the mechanism is uncertain , but it appears to be brain rather than ear connected ( in very simple terms ) . 
  no one internationally , no , but unfortunately the israeli extreme-right has swallowed the report whole and will do all it can to use it as a weapon in their openly stated goal of `` creeping annexation '' . 
  it is , of course , the extreme-right who currently wield power in israel and thus on the ground in the wb ; led by netanyahu , but with the ultra-nationalist , ( illegal ) settlers ' representative party - jewish home - disastrously seeming to enjoy a disproportionately influential role in the coalition . 
  jewish home are of course led by [ naftali bennett ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naftali_bennett#israeli.e2.80.93palestinian_conflict ) - the man who has openly called for creeping annexation , who has stated he has killed many arabs in the past and that `` there is no problem with it '' and who advocates the most egregious type of ethnic cleansing as public policy !, 
  he is ably supported by his henchwoman , the very outspokenly aggressive [ ayelet shaked ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2015/05/netanyahu-palestinians-government/ ) and mk betzalel smotrich ( [ recently famous for his and his wife 's recent racism after - shock - having to give birth next to a palestinian woman ... ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/04/06/world/middleeast/06reuters-israel-racism.html?ref=middleeast&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new%20campaign&amp;utm_term=*morning%20brief&amp;_r=0 ) ) . 
  unfortunately , led by such individuals , and as [ mondoweiss called over a month ago ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2016/03/netanyahu-govt-is-implementing-annexation-of-west-bank-as-secret-but-official-policy/ ) , the israeli regime is , very quietly , now basing its policy on the levy report . 
  the only answer i can possibly see is the imposition of sanctions - perhaps on individuals , as per russia to avoid alienating the israeli centre and left who certainly do not support the right 's insanity . 
  ( there is currently quite a vigorous discussion happening in israel between supporters of the right-wing and the rest of the nation who finally seem to be growing wearing of toeing the right-wing-extremists ' line - these people should not be punished , both as a matter of morality and one of realpolitik , given that it is their support the world needs to end the madness of netanyahu and his thugs ! ), 
  this , as is explained in the article about him linked above , has already been mooted for bennett - by a group of jewish , labour zionist , academics ( who are ardent opponents of the morally dubious bds campaign ) - and would seem to be a possible way forward , imo at least . 
  the irgun may have been absorbed into the idf some seventy-odd years ago , but its leader - the truly villainous [ ze'ev jabotinsky ] ( http://www.wrmea.org/2006-may-june/hamas-a-pale-image-of-the-jewish-irgun-and-lehi-gangs.html ) is * [ still heavily lauded in israel to this day ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) * , an indication that his actions are not yet objects of disgust for israelis and that therefore , to some extent , the attitudes he embodies must remain extant within the israeli psyche . 
  for any who are unaware , jabotinsky was a fervent admirer of mussolini and leader of the irgun ( the modern me 's first terrorist organisation and perpetrator of the vicious crimes detailed above in the excellent link provided by u/edward _ snowdenhands ) about whom the following has been [ written ] ( http://www.cecaust.com.au/main.asp?sub=culture/jewish&amp;id=p3/article3.htm ) :, 
   jabotinsky incorporated his racial theories of zionism from the international eugenics movement , whose leading proponents wrote hitler 's racial theories . 
  in 1913 , he wrote a document that could have been used by the german nazi party . 
  `` let us draw for ourself the ideal type of an ` absolute nation , ' | '' he wrote . 
  `` it would have to possess a racial appearance of marked unique character , an appearance different from the racial nature of that nation 's neighbors . 
  it would have to occupy from time immemorial a continuous and clearly defined piece of land ; it would be highly desirable if in that area there would be no alien minorities , who would weaken national unity . 
  it would have to maintain an original national language , which is not derived from another nation . '', 
  indeed , the currently ruling coalition is formed primarily of [ likud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/likud ) ( the irgun 's direct political descendant , started by former irgun commander - ie brutal terrorist - and israeli pm , menachem begin who easily matches jabotinsky 's record of murder and mayhem ) and ultra-right-wing-extremist party [ the jewish home ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2014/08/knesset-genocide-against/ ) , who openly advocate annexation , ethnic cleansing and even , as the linked article makes clear in jewish home mk and netanyahu 's * justice * minister ( !!! ), 
  ayelet shaked 's * own words * , genocide . 
  in this very real sense , ie that `` the irgun mentality '' still manifestly lives on in israeli right-wing politics , the list of irgun attacks provided is entirely germane to your original comment . 
  edit : forgot link discussing jabotinsky 's dubious achievements - in one attack ( king david hotel ) the irgun killed ** 91 ** people in a * single attack * !, 
  ( including 17 jews . ), 
  can you imagine the violence of the idf 's response to a single israeli death by hamas rocket multiplied by ninety-one ? 
  there would be many thousands of casualties amongst gazan civilians , taking the most recent assault , 2014 's protective edge , as a guide ... 
  well if it 's that simple then , yes , of course there has been . 
  '67 is still only 49 years ago and there has undoubtedly been population displacement in the wb areas that have suffered virtual , de facto , annexation by illegal settlement . 
  ethnic cleansing is n't just mass murder and genocide . 
  ethnic cleansing as a term originates from the yugoslavian civil war of the '90s and refers to the `` cleansing '' of territory of the other race . 
  wherever the illegal settlers have chosen to hang their hats the local palestinian population has been removed from the settlement area and gross impositions such as check points and martial law imposed on those that remain closest . 
  palestinians must use different roads . 
  they are blocked from the land israelis want by a wall . 
  the land has been ethnically cleansed . 
  massacres of palestinians aplenty have also occurred since ' 67 , including the war itself ( started by israel for territorial expansion ) from gaza to lebanon . 
  perhaps , or perhaps you 've lost sight of it ? 
  genocide is usually described as extreme , yet genocide is what the jewish home preach - at best apartheid and ethnic cleansing , at worst literal , mass murder genocide . 
  all on public record , in their own words . 
  living within the israeli bubble , whether as an american admirer or bona fide , ultra-zionist , you have clearly become desensitised to what others consider `` extreme '' . 
  not that obvious . 
  titty bars do n't excuse colonisation and apartheid in the wb , or civilian mass casualties in gaza , at least not in my book . 
  especially for a society that claims to be civilised . 
  i support israel 's existence and ongoing self-determination ; i simply feel the palestinians deserve the same . 
  israel should stop the creeping annexation and accept the arab iniative peace deal : work the land out based on '67 borders with realistic land swaps for settlements too large to clear and allow a realistic number of palestinian refugees choose israeli citizenship or financial restitution . 
  in return the arabs all recognise israel , including the palestinians , end to claims of right of return by palestinian refugees , no more attacks ; also , i believe jews must be allowed to swap israeli citizenship for palestinian if they want to live in wb as palestinian citizens . 
  peace achieved and international law respected , that would make israel a rational , progressive society . 
  no more dead israelis , no more dead palestinians . 
  the rest of us do n't have to watch this crap going on . 
  good for everyone . 
  i did n't say there was apartheid in israel ; i specified the wb . 
  there , the fifty-year old existence of two classes of citizen separated by their ethnicity is clearly apartheid by any definition of the word other than a strict , `` capital a '' apartheid referring specifically to the sa system . 
  how high is your definition of mass casualties ? 
  a [ mass casualty event ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass-casualty_incident ) is an event where the number and severity of casualties overwhelms the ability of medical services to cope - the entirety of operation protecttive edge in '14 was an extended mass casualty event . 
  personally , i would count a minimum of 1,000 civilian deaths ( the hugely underreporting official idf figure , international bodies and pa reporting nearly double the idf 's estimates ) in such a short time span as mass casualties . 
  how many have to die for you to acknowledge mass casualties ? 
  it seems 100k is not enough for you ; how many does it take ? 
  the outline i gave was of the [ arab initiative peace plan that * israel * keeps quietly ignoring and rejecting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass-casualty_incident ) , not any plan offered by israel and rejected by the palestinians . 
   not that simple, 
  the zionist terrorists rejoined the mainstream once their political goals were achieved , why should the palestinians be any different ? 
  or are palestinians all mere slavering , jew-hating , beasts who will throw away their own ( and their family 's ) future * even after getting what they want * and being given sovereignty and dignity , in your humble opinion ? 
  i apologise if i phrased my comment such that you felt i was accusing you of bigotry , that was n't my intent . 
  i was genuinely asking the question , having encountered such opinions in others . 
  and of course the palestinians do n't need to be `` given '' anything . 
  they should be allowed their basic national rights , but have to earn anything beyond that - just like any other people . 
  ksa and israel are pretty much the only two countries in the region who * refuse * to fight isis ... 
  yes , those evil iranians , hoping to shoot down all of israel 's bombs and missiles !, 
  til : shooting down israeli ordnance aimed at your own population centres and bases , within your own country , is anti-semitic ... 
   `` i hereby denounce the effects that social media have on my children , their disobedience and their disrespect , '' the woman shouts while brandishing a shotgun as her surly children watch on . 
  it 's lucky those kids have such a grounded , well-balanced mother to set them straight after too much social media !,
