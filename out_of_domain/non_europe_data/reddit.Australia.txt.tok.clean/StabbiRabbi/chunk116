  oh no , that was a good one !, 
  should * never * forget that . 
  yeah , the f119 and f135 both use hollow titanium . 
  it 's not just airliner engines these days . 
  u/hazachu 's point is that he will always remain an `` alleged terrorist '' now that it 's impossible to try him following his extra-judicial execution . 
  he should have been tried and punished by the state by way of a trial trial , not shot dead in cold-blood by a rogue soldier . 
  no , but his point is that they are knowingly risking attack when they decide to squat on others ' land ... 
  source ? 
  any actual sources , or just your confirmation bias ? 
  no , i meant sources that referred to the murderer 's arrest * before * the film was released , as per the commenter to whom i replied 's outlandish claim above ... 
  that article was about the film , it does not mention * anywhere * when he was arrested , let alone prove it happened before the film became public . 
  in that report of an idf press release the question was asked and answered after the film emerged and the army had time to respond to it . 
  what is being asked for is something that gives * any * indication that the murderer was arrest immediately following his crime , or at least shortly after he returned to base and his superiors were made aware of his actions . 
  in fact anything that simply shows ( or even just tells ) that he was arrested by the idf as a matter of course , not just because * his * crime had been filmed - and so a spokesman had to read a press release at a press conference . 
  i mean , nobody in the film of the murder tries to restrain or arrest him - they do n't even act surprised or really even react much at all . 
  you can almost hear the `` meh '' . 
  we just want to know the exact time and circumstances of his arrest , with evidence such as arrest records . 
  the military would have logged the entire incident with patrol , incident and radio logs at the very least . 
  not hard to prove really ... 
  unless of course he * was * only arrested * after * the film came to light ? 
  surely you see the issue ? 
  what has `` held '' got to do with it ? 
  stop moving the goalposts please . 
  why would i supply * you * with a source when * i * requested a source for the op i relied to 's assertion the criminal had been arrested before the release of the film . 
  that is all . 
  simple enough , is n't it ? 
  so , in its first paragraph , that article says exactly that the killer was arrested * after * the video was released . 
  that answers the question very clearly at last , thank you . 
  the guy who started this thread by saying the arrest was * before * the video was released was wrong , either minsinformed or lying . 
  anyone who tries arguing with these foaming-at-the-mouth `` israel can do no wrong '' delusional apologists is , clearly , ipso facto , delusional . 
  an israeli apologist usually lacks * the capacity * to change their mind , living within the `` israeli narrative hothouse '' and hearing the dissimulations , the whataboutisms , the disingenuity non-stop , brainwashing-style . 
  arguing with them is instructional for observers , but otherwise it 's quixotic an endeavour at best . 
  not at all . 
  very zionist actually - believe wholeheartedly in israel 's right to exist , just think palestinians deserve the same and disagree with some regime policies re : the occupied territories . 
  you know , the normal international concerns . 
  it 's been forty-three years since the last time israel was attacked by a neighboring state . 
  of the previous four wars , israel started two . 
  israel is also wholly responsible for the security situation in palestine , for both themselves and the palestinians , as it was their egregious colonial expansionism that not only led too , but also continuously fuels , the conflict in the occupied territories . 
  you forgot to mention the '53 suez emergency , when israel invaded egypt . 
  also the necessity of '67 is very much disputed and the record of pre-war israeli provocations leading up to it very well known . 
  so that puts it 50/50 in my reckoning . 
  finally , most historians agree that yom kippur was mounted solely to regain territory - not `` destroy israel '' as you so melodramatically put it . 
  two references to this , for both egypt and syria , are provided from the first paragraph of the wikipedia page on the war if you do n't believe me . 
  yom kippur is also when israel threatened to trigger a global nuclear war if the usa did not supply weapons immediately . 
  hardly the nation 's finest hour . 
  israel and ksa seem to be working ever more closely , behind closed doors . 
  the sunnis are more obsessed with the shia than israel . 
  about as much as israelis love arabs , i guess . 
  nonetheless , as things stand , unless there is a change of government israel 's regime is hand in hand with ksa 's . 
  i thought it * used * to be about strategic value and jabotinsky et al 's * eretz israel * , but [ now it 's about claiming all the oil ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677597-geologists-israel-think-they-have-found-oilin-very-tricky-territory-black-gold ) ? 
  and [ oil ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677597-geologists-israel-think-they-have-found-oilin-very-tricky-territory-black-gold ) , as well as the notional eretz israel which many claim includes golan . 
  what about irgun and the stern gang ? 
  i note you do n't bother to dispute that netanyahu 's plan to annex golan is due to [ oil ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677597-geologists-israel-think-they-have-found-oilin-very-tricky-territory-black-gold ) . 
  why would they be risking war with the us ? 
  the whole world views golan as syrian , only israel talks about [ right of conquest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_conquest ) being legally valid , especially following a war of aggression such as the six day war . 
  israel is talking now about keeping golan due to [ oil ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677597-geologists-israel-think-they-have-found-oilin-very-tricky-territory-black-gold ) , as well as the whole eretz israel concept ( which i am sure both netanyahu and especially the jewish home positively froth at the mouth over ... ) - neither of which motives are particularly likely to supported by anyone outside israel . 
  i think russia could roll israel up just fine . 
  of course the us would protect israel itself - or at least i hope they would , but the land israel illegally squats on ? 
  that is perhaps less clear cut . 
  both were created to fight with local arabs and the british , but the haganah is the self-defence force you might be thinking of . 
  the irgun and the stern gang were certainly not defensive in their outlook . 
  both were also absorbed into the idf when israel was established , which is different from being `` outlawed '' , going on to commit the worst of the atrocities during the nakbah period of indigenous palestinian population expulsions . 
  subsequently yitzhak shamir , leader of the stern gang , was elected israeli pm , as was the irgun 's leader menachem begin ( also founder of the now ruling likud party ) , whilst his irgun colleague [ ze'ev jabotinsky 's name is the most popular street name in israel ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) . 
  so i think israel 's terroristic past is not so far back , either in history or culture . 
  surely the timing is not entirely coincidental though ? 
   irgun was a splinter group from the hagganah , established as a result of the 1929 riots and massacre of jews . 
  they took the tactic of active retaliation and deterrence . 
  is active retaliation and deterrence how you would describe the tactics of the stab attackers or hamas ? 
  do n't you feel that declaring the organisations as outlawed terrorists , whilst welcoming their members into the idf and paying them as soldiers in addition to voting the groups ' leaders into positions of ultimate power in israel was somewhat of a toothless gesture ? 
  do you think that gesture was so toothless because ben-gurion - as many historians suggest - * did * authorise their targets and so was directly involved and thus unable to punish them more severely or because their actions were , in fact , accepted as necessary or even celebrated within israeli culture and the banning was essentially a pr stunt ? 
  because ... ? 
  well now , you see that 's now considered the bad old way of doing things . 
  i understand the attraction of `` might is right '' to israel with regards to the occupied territories , but the world is * trying * to move on from those days . 
  israel is , in fact , one of the only throwback ( to an earlier state of national consciousness/understanding/evolution ) nations left who are still clinging on to this primitivist mode of thinking . 
  hence all the international condemnation . 
  how do you think you would feel about `` sovereign states decide their territory '' if egypt , ksa and all the gcc states decided to invade israel and israel lost ? 
  i assume you would n't demand global intervention to assist maintain israeli sovereignty then , would you ? 
  but israel started the '67 war . 
  after a long series of border provocations initiated by the idf to keeps tensions high and test arab defences and despite clear intelligence from the usa and the ussr that nasser had no intention , nor was even capable , of attacking israel . 
  and syria were only answering their treaty obligations when an ally was attacked without even a declaration of war . 
  so the '' '67 was * their * fault '' argument does n't really hold water now , does it ? 
  i like to think of it as being hopeful that israel will one day want to join in the international community of nations , abiding by the rules and thus avoiding the international odium israel , currently increasingly , attracts rather than na\u00efve . 
  maybe your right though and it is na\u00efve to hope israel even cares about its current borderline rogue state status ... 
   israel will one day want to join in the international community of nations , *** abiding by the rules *** and thus avoiding the international odium israel , currently increasingly , attracts, 
    israel is already a member of the international community . 
  what are you even talking about now ? 
  keep your arguments relevant to the article . 
  the key part you missed was `` abiding the rules '' . 
  i guess i * should * have emphasised i meant a member of the international community * in good standing * - israel is of course a member of the international community already , as you rightly point out . 
   returning land to an enemy who has tried to wipe you out several times is something of a fairy tale . 
  and yet the sinai has be returned multiple times ... 
  so you see , there * is * hope that israel * can * be pressured into acting reasonably and not like a spoilt toddler !, 
   i would certainly not expect them to jail everyone , if that 's what you 're alluding ( if not , my bad ) . 
  that 's pretty reasonable , and more reasonable than i would expect many of hamas 's victims to be in the event . 
  i - as an unbiased , zionist/pro-palestinian sovereignty/humanist actually feel that * some * hamas leaders * should * be tried under * any * circumstances , but i suppose that is an issue that will have to be worked out in the settlement . 
  i imagine that it would be a thorny issue though and thus perhaps avoided - so long as israel does n't just assassinate such leaders in the few years following a peace agreement ... 
  it should n't be necessary to imprison former rank and file members and as the us experience in iraq demonstrated it is certainly better to roll former regime troops back into new security forces rather than leaving them to form insurgencies . 
  however , a rejection of the terrorist ideology is certainly necessary : something that lauding the `` former '' terrorist leaders , heaping honours upon them and electing them into positions of power does not really help achieve . 
  as the state ( first israel , hopefully palestine to come soon ) evolves , obviously their political tactics - of which military tactics are essentially an extension - evolve too . 
  i believe that , like israel , palestine will shake off its terrorist roots ( meaning the former members of hamas must be reintegrated ) ; however , a public rejection of the terrorists , their ideology and their tactics is something that may be required as part of the reconciliation process .
