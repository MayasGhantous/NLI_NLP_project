  so why does any and all criticism of the israeli government get jumped on so heavily by pro-israeli commenters ? 
  i have never suggested israel should n't exist ( as i believe it should exist with continued self-determination ) - i just oppose the cruelty and injustice meted out to the palestinians , the warmongering with iran and the disdain for international law that so many pro-israelis seem to possess . 
  in particular the current unholy alliance of likud ( aka son of irgun ) and the jewish home with its ultra-right-wing extremism disturbs me , and i say so . 
  i also enjoy history and write about historical facts . 
  i am not against israel or its people at all though and am just a critical of ksa , for example . 
  despite this , i am often subjected to outrageous personal attacks , accusations and bloc downvoting by various pro-israeli redditors . 
  if it 's ok to criticise the government , then why all the hate ? 
  edit : lol at this simple question receiving downvotes , but no answers ... 
  this is such bullshit . 
  the area was called palestine * before * the kingdom of israel ( 1000-730bc ) . 
  here is the [ etymology ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palestine#etymology ) :, 
   from latin palaest\u012bna ( `` roman province of palestine '' ) , from ancient greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 ( palaist\u00edn\u0113 , `` philistia and the surrounding region '' ) , from hebrew \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea ( p ` l\u00e9shet , `` philistia , land of the philistines '' ) , from the root \u05e4 \u05be \u05dc \u05be \u05e9 ( p-l-\u0161 , `` migrate , invade '' ) . 
  the term p-l-s-t or p-r-s-t , found in five ancient egyptian inscriptions ( beginning with one at medinet habu from circa 1170 bce and ending with padiiset 's statue inscription from circa 900-850 bce ) as the name of a people near egypt , is traditionally taken to be cognate . 
  seven assyrian inscriptions contain the word `` palas ( h ) tu '' or `` pilistu '' , which is usually also taken to be cognate . 
  the issue of modern palestinian nationhood is more complex , but here the waters are muddied by the circumstances since the zionists picked palestine as their `` homeland '' . 
  had it not been for the aggression of the zionists towards the end of the british mandate then a palestinian nation would undoubtedly have emerged in common with all of the other `` new '' nations that were `` formed '' post-wwii as colonialism collapsed under its own weight . 
  the nation state is a european construct and one of relatively recent creation , even within europe ( most european nations only emerged post-wwi ) . 
  of course palestinians did n't think of themselves in those terms under the ottomans , but they still fought the ottomans for freedom from the imperial yoke within their ancestral homelands . 
  the effort to deny the existence of `` palestinians '' is an effort to justify the wholesale displacement of a people from their homes as somehow not being immoral because `` they were n't a nation '' . 
  it is the most transparent of fig leaves !, 
  look , i 'm going to have to report you for that troll comment . 
  keep things civil please mate . 
  as i have explained to others , despite what you think , my username refers to the [ sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ) - the world 's first known terrorists - and is a commentary on the cyclical nature of violence . 
  these guys were ultra-extremist jews who went around stabbing other jews in public to cause terror , until they foolishly took on the romans and ultimately surrendered after hiding out in one of herod 's pleasure palaces , masada . 
  it 's interesting how they invented terrorism millennia ago and now it 's returned to haunt their descendants ... that 's all the name means . 
  your wikipedia link ? 
  if i could change i would , but i ca n't . 
  just because * you do n't like * what i have to say does n't make it untrue . 
  i would advise you to read the comment properly and respond like a grown-up . 
  oh , and i never said `` random '' ( or `` jews '' for that matter ) as i do understand full well why the zionists picked palestine ... 
  please do n't put words into my mouth . 
  erdogan refuting an islamist constitution seems to me to be like julius caesar refusing the king 's diadem offered to him by marc antony when he saw the crowd 's disapproval - he tested the waters , but found it not warm enough to jump in yet ... 
  is the idf * that * unprofessional ? 
  interesting . 
  obviously they have massive discipline issues ( extra-judicial murders anyone ? 
  ) , but i did n't realise things had degraded so much people could just walk out of their armouries with weapons and ammunition !, 
  that 's quite scary considering israel has nukes ... 
  well , he sounds like a knob , but to be fair he was defending his sister 's baby 's right to claim nordic ancestry despite being mixed-race . 
  it 's kind of confusing , but within the parameters of `` beliefs nordic-american race warriors hold '' he actually * is n't * the bigot here . 
  nonetheless his comment is ( unintentionally ) hilarious . 
  i would be willing to bet my last buck it was written without a shred of irony in mind . 
  oh man , that book * was * traumatising as a kid . 
  great story though . 
  on a side note i used to live near where it was set and as a cub scout hiked in the exact location the original warren was located . 
  it 's actually quite a long way irl , but yes you could do it and it 's beautiful countryside . 
  what ? 
  i just responded to the information provided by the previous commenter . 
  ironically , you seem to be painting * me * with an unreasonably broad brush . 
  i am actually a confirmed pro-zionist who believes 100 % in israel 's right to existence and ongoing self-determination . 
  i do take exception to the present israeli regime with its extreme right wing ideology ( the jewish home in particular are very scary , amoral people ) and to how the infection of the idf with this ideology results in even worse outcomes for the palestinians , but i am most certainly not on some anti-israel hate trip , and actively challenge open anti-semitism when i encounter it . 
  i 'm actually on your side here , guy . 
  i do n't tend to comment on isolated incidents - as this particular incident seems , to the best of our knowledge , to be - as much as i do on the ongoing horrors of the occupation , but this piqued my interest as the guy i replied to sounded like he has a good knowledge of the idf ( as most israelis naturally do , obviously !, 
  i 've seen it . 
  tbh , i think that the movie is where i link the childhood trauma to more than the book . 
  that song - `` bright eyes '' ... 
   the equipment was vital in ensuring that the cease-fire held as it replaced israeli losses during the war . 
  very little of the large equipment ( including planes ) arrived before the fighting was already over . 
  not quite right - [ factory fresh f-4s and a-4s were being ferried by october 13th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_nickel_grass ) , only half way through the war and certainly during the period in which the battle hung in the balance with israel terrified of losing ... 
  i give you that i had missed the background as to * why * the germans donated the first to submarines ( which was actually very interesting ) , but it does n't make any difference to what extent the submarines are a german design and what extent they use israeli subsystems . 
  it certainly is a custom design ; however , at least as far as the hull/propulsion system/acoustic properties and so on it is still an entirely german design . 
  as far as the lavi goes all i can say is history tells the story . 
  [ scouting started in england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scouting#history_2 ) !, 
  if you read the whole thread through it gets even more amusing . 
  they 're * really * into it and take the whole thing * extremely * seriously indeed . 
  calculators out in every case . 
   you 're still spouting off about ancestry , but today , especially in such a varied nation as the us , you ca n't tell by outward appearances what a person 's ancestral line consists of . 
  i 'm a 6 ' 1 '' , 280lb celt/norse man with pale skin and a red beard , so i fit the mold for the traditional heathen , but i have a friend who looks black , is only 1/4 black , and also follows our path . 
  that 's because his father 's side is all scandinavian . 
  you could n't tell by looking , but that 's who he is . 
  comedy gold !, 
  you could n't make this stuff up if you tried ... 
  especially when they apply the results to their paganist belief system to work out exactly who can and can not worship the mighty odin !, 
  ( aka sir anthony hopkins . ), 
  i thought the knowledge of aircraft manufacturing was fairly widely known ; however , i am interested in aircraft so my background level of knowledge may be more detailed than your own . 
  what exactly would you like to know more about ( with sauces ! ) ? 
  for example , do you understand what i mean about generations of aircraft or know any of the history of other countries ' development programs ? 
  the sub stuff is just a google away , and makes it very clear that the dolphin is merely an enlarged german type 212 sub , one of the best selling submarines globally . 
  they just offered an even larger version of the same design to australia , although australia went with a french designed submarine instead . 
  again , i thought much of this was fairly `` general knowledge '' , but if you 're interested and your googling skills are weak i am happy to provide supporting information ? 
  edit : added examples of sources you might need . 
  what a cunt . 
  i wonder if he 's the idiot in the green suit with the fluoro ginger hair on the `` muh heritage '' banner above ? 
  the uk labour party is really having a bad run with these anti-semitic idiots . 
  one could be just a bad apple , but so many , so close together ? 
  that surely has to be indicative of some kind of real cultural problem within the party , especially as they clearly do n't feel any need to keep this kind of unambiguous bigotry to themselves , but rather are happy to shout it from the rooftops . 
  obviously corbyn as leader does n't help , given his support of terrorist groups , but whatever the source of the problem they need to vet their members and sort it out . 
  statements like this , from the former lord mayor of london no less , are bizarrely ignorant and it 's both disturbing and disgusting that he holds , let alone expresses such views . 
  or , in other words :, 
   war is peace . 
  freedom is slavery . 
  ignorance is strength . 
  it is more than tolerated , he has enjoyed a great deal of press coverage and suffered no legal consequences from his statements , merely being suspended by his political party as a matter of their own choice . 
  whatever he meant , what he said was pretty bloody insensitive . 
  exporting germany 's jews to palestine is not exactly zionism - as livingstone must well be aware . 
  raaf f-111s to be exact , affectionately known as pigs . 
  just google `` pearl harbor attack 1941 '' , that 's a good start towards understanding the capabilities of the imperial japanese navy 's warship fleet during wwii . 
  not an american and i do get your point , but let 's not forget the us was the first country to suffer the horrors of industrialised warfare in the form of the american civil war ( or , for southerners in the us , `` the war of northern aggression '' ) . 
  whilst there were no air raids it was still a total war that inflicted massive carnage both on and off the battlefield . 
  [ the b-1b 's no longer perform the nuclear mission ] ( http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/b-1b/ ) , but nonetheless still do function as strategic bombers , albeit only carrying conventional weaponry . 
  a lot of people who were not accepted by australia directly already follow that exact path to residency here .
