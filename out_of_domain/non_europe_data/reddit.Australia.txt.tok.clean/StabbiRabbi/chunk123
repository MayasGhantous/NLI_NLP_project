  somewhere at least , ha ha . 
  yeah , i 'm just joking really about the kiwis . 
  the aussie/nz thing is pretty much how you describe it and of course most kiwis are perfectly understandable ( though i will say a minority can sometimes be quite hard to understand , especially when it comes to certain words/sounds ) . 
  i actually really like nz , it 's a beautiful country . 
  sounds like you had a good trip there . 
  sigh . 
  that 's the whole point - he * was n't * armed with a knife when his murderer blew him away . 
  in fact , he was n't armed at all . 
  to be precise , he was n't even conscious . 
  the murderer is n't accused of being racist - he is acknowledged by the idf as being linked to the religious nationalist movement . 
  like the government members bennett and shaked . 
  are all israelis racist ? 
  no , certainly not . 
  are palestinians oppressed by those that are ? 
  without a doubt . 
  now , i have said all of this before , please do n't make me have to repeat myself again . 
  try reading the comments properly and then thinking * before * you type anything . 
  that way , if you want to , we might have a productive conversation . 
  or i can stop dealing with inanities like this most recent comment at least . 
  strawman # 2/whataboutism, 
  i have n't offered my opinion on arab nationalism . 
  jews no . 
  jewish israelis ? 
  in a sense , yes definitely - especially those living in the illegal settlements or serving in the occupation forces . 
  the stabbing attacks must impart an oppressive atmosphere amongst these people as they fear the next attack . 
  again though , this is a strawman . 
  i have never offered any support for the stabbing attacks . 
  all attacks on civilians are equally vile and indefensible , as is any attack on a defenceless victim . 
  how is that so complicated that you keep proffering these ludicrous `` counterpoints '' which are * all * strawmen ? 
  or are you just being edgy ? 
  i note from your history that you 're a goth , is this all just teenage angst ? 
  the jewish home party do a perfectly good job of equating the * religious nationalist movement * ( what i have been discussing and always referred to , not generic jewish nationalism ) with racism themselves . 
  some of shaked 's pro-extermination statements are linked above itt iirc in case you 're unaware of their attitudes and policy . 
  for more information google naftali bennett . 
  these people openly argue for segregation , ethnic cleansing and even extermination of the palestinians . 
  it is specifically to them and the illegal settlers they represent to whom i refer . 
  i do n't think this view of them is in any way controversial . 
  if that stabbing had not been attempted then that particular palestinian would not have been shot at that particular time , no . 
  the murderer was not actually present for the attack though and everything was secure when he arrived and without any hesitation chambered a round and shot his victim in the head . 
  his actions were so deliberate that if there were not specifically pre-mediated for that event he must at least have considered his reaction to such a situation and decided that murder would be his chosen course of action . 
  of course we can not know his exact thoughts , but linking his religious nationalist ideology to such thinking is an obvious connection to make . 
  the movement 's leader , bennett , says `` i have killed many arabs . 
  there is no problem with it '' and so what does his acolyte , the murderous medic , do ? 
  shoots an arab the first opportunity he gets . 
   except without control of the government ? 
  er , the jewish home is the second most significant element of netanyahu 's ruling coalition . 
  bennett and shaked have both been cabinet ministers since straight after the election . 
  shaked is justice minister ... 
  these guys * are * the government . 
  and all of those statements have been made whilst in power . 
  except that guy did get bit on his dick last week ... 
  brands count as culture in america ? 
  gingers have no soul - the redhead would have gone straight to hell anyway . 
  i suggest you read subs such a r/credibledefense and r/lesscredibledefence - both subs have had posts regarding western/nato assessments of russian ew capabilities since the latest russian equipment was encountered in ukraine and syria . 
  the su-24 shutting down an aegis system is just bs ( as far as any credible source has to say ) ; however , russia 's advances in ew equipment and doctrine both seem to be matters of some concern . 
  this is in specific areas ( active jamming and other forms of ew ) , but is apparently a very real strength . 
  like investing in iads ( another strength of russia 's military , with its sam and associated systems being highly regarded ) , ew is a relatively cheap way of asymmetrically countering the west 's undisputed strengths in pgms , drones and sensor systems . 
  drones particularly can not operate in a hostile electronic environment - if they ca n't communicate they ca n't fly , let alone perform their role . 
  western military equipment manufacturers are currently trying to mitigate the dangers of these strengths by looking at systems that are not so reliant on gps for example . 
  there 's a lot of information out there about this stuff , even without reading any russian fanboy/troll factory content . 
  unless that 's what your into of course ... 
  that is straight out of the sovcit playbook , specifically the [ redemption movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redemption_movement ) that * exposes * ( lol ) how the government swapped from the gold standard to using its citizenry to back currency . 
  it 's related to all that `` if you write your name in all caps it 's the entity , not you so you do n't have to honour any such document '' bullshit . 
  always amusing stuff , but the arse does make it even more compelling in this case . 
  the usaaf was probably the largest and qualitatively best equipped by war 's end ( b-29s , p-47s , p-51s , b-26 invader and etc ) . 
  the raf was also very large and well equipped , with some british designs being far superior to their american equivalents ( mosquito , tempest , lancaster - excellent aircraft all ) . 
  the luftwaffe was also equipped with some excellent aircraft and possessed some brilliant pilots , but by the end of the war were pretty much a spent force after years of doctrinal and production mistakes . 
  the red airforce started out very weak ( leading to the german aces ' incredibly high kill scores ) , but ended up very strong with some excellent aircraft that were sometimes the equal of anything the raf or usaaf flew ( il-2 , il-10 , yak fighters ) . 
  the raaf and rcaf were incredibly large during wwii ( raaf was 5th largest af in the world at the end of wwii !, 
  ) , but the rcaf was basically embedded into the raf , as was a great deal of the raaf . 
  usn/usmc air power dominated the pacific over both the ijn and the japanese army once tactics and aircraft quality caught up to the japanese , who did have an early lead which was lost as soon as aircraft such as the p-38 lightning , f6f hellcat and f4u corsair came into the theatre . 
  and that would be `` the be ** a ** tles '' surely ? 
   the notion that you are more concerned with israel being able to righteously label the actions of palestinian terrorists as war crimes than the actual war crimes the palestinian terrorists are committing is pretty disturbing . 
  it 's not really though - israel 's strategy with regards to palestine is quite clearly to obfuscate the truth of events within the conflict so israel may claim the moral high ground and thus avoid censure for * its * crimes , at least enough to carry on committing these crimes . 
  a major tactic within this information/propaganda war is to accuse the palestinians of doing exactly the same things as israel/the zionists themselves did/do unapologetically . 
  so israel excuses its bombing of civilians by claiming it is only responding to palestinian terrorism , claiming that its own deliberate targeting of civilian targets is entirely justified because terrorism , a tactic of war to which it - and the rest of the world - is something that israel naturally opposed to . 
  however , at the same time israel * keeps * building monuments to the quite literally evil men who performed vile terrorist acts on behalf of the zionists while they struggled to achieve their political goals . 
  for example , a * new * `` monument '' that celebrates the heinous king david hotel attack committed by irgun has recently been unveiled ( an attack that killed 92 people - many more than the palestinians * ever * kill in a single attack ) . 
  how can israel claim that the palestinians are the wicked enemies of all that is good and right because they 're terrorists even as israel honours its own terrorists ? 
  it 's not even as if that terrorism is even really in the past - likud was formed by former irgun terrorists and directly carries that lineage into the present day pm of israel 's office . 
  you might have a point if israel was not committing war crimes left , right and centre itself , but we all know that is far from the case . 
  the illegal settlements are in direct breach of the geneva convention ( to which israel is signatory ) - that 's a war crime . 
  idf members are carrying out extra-judicial executions of palestinians at literally * every * opportunity ( i 'm not just talking about the recent `` murderous medic '' furore , but also the fact the ** no ** stab attacker has been arrested , not even one - all being killed by the idf , who have even been filmed planting knives ! ), 
  - that 's a war crime . 
  the idf bombed several un schools known to be in use as bomb shelters for civilians during `` operation protective edge '' ( that name * has * to be deliberately ironic , surely ? ), 
  and killed kids playing soccer on the beach in two incidents , one by drone and the other by naval gunfire - that 's a string of war crimes . 
  i could go on and on with a laundry list of similar israeli war crimes , but i think i have proved my point quite clearly enough already . 
  accusing the palestinians of using dirty tactics whilst performing equally morally dubious actions itself goes beyond hypocrisy due to the way it is used as a tactic in the conflict to divert attention away from israeli transgressions . 
  as such , it is important to not let this muddying of the waters actually work , but rather to confront israeli hypocrisy head-on and let the world know the totality of the situation . 
  is it right for hamas to attack civilians ? 
  absolutely not . 
  are israel justified in complaining about it ? 
  certainly . 
  are israel any better ? 
  not in the slightest . 
  the fact that you are so insistent on pushing this false victimhood narrative is in itself highly disturbing . 
  do you * genuinely * believe israeli/zionist war crimes are somehow excusable , whilst the palestinian equivalents are not , or are you being deliberately disingenuous ? 
  in this conflict , probably more than any other in history , public perception is as much of a battlefield as the streets of gaza whilst israel desperately tries to continue its creeping annexation of palestine 's remains before the world puts a stop to it . 
  in such a context this willful national hypocrisy is another weapon in and of itself . 
  only because i listed the most advanced aircraft fielded by britain towards the end of the war , but - especially given the massive improvements made to the later marks that kept it relevant until the last day of combat - it should really be in the list , yes .
