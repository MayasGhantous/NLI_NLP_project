  anyway , my original comment was predicated on a false premise so i have edited it heavily to correct what i wrote . 
  it 's compound inflation man . 
  oh , is this news ? 
  saudi hands were clearly all over the whole thing - clearly many , many individuals if not the establishment per se . 
  what 's going to happen when the saudis run out of money ? 
  i did n't think there was much dispute about it being an occupation tbh , or that the occupation is legal . 
  the occupation per se i personally can live with until both sides make the necessary compromises to achieve peace , to their mutual benefit . 
  honestly , what i find most hard to stomach is the combination of the bad behaviours i see ( from the political extreme right/settlers almost exclusively ) with the cynical self-justification and double standards i have already mentioned . 
  it 's true that i find it equally unpleasant from palestinians and their supporters , but i very rarely see anyone going anywhere near condoning , let alone denying palestinian terrorism and how shitty it is . 
  of course some do , but i feel i have as little in common with them as i would someone like the charming ayelet shaked . 
  i think `` staple '' is overstating the case somewhat , but yes of course the palestinians must take responsibility for their violence and apparent stubborn refusal to acknowledge reality , let alone accept it . 
  yeah , and how is this even news ? 
  first few words out of his mouth and i had him marked for an alp voter . 
  what ? 
  i see no problem with this natural , red-white-and-blue-blooded patriotism . 
  american imperialism is manifest destiny anyway , not like the nasty european form . 
  hey , i remember you well and good to see you itt - i did n't so much `` have a go '' as just react to a misinterpreted comment of yours about my interest in the me and its various rogue states . 
  i 've never been a fan of the saudis either , but your depth of understanding of them is far greater than my own and your analysis most welcome . 
  much of what you wrote is much along the lines of what i imagined as the likely outcome , though i was unaware of the ford-era plan . 
  selling even part of aramco is a pretty desperate move - their mortgaging the family jewels there , and at a time when family jewels are going cheap . 
  sure they 'll get a big one time cash influx , but after that their earning ability will be reduced even further - all well and good if they manage their money well , but they should n't need to sell a single share in aramco given the hundreds of billions they have salted away already . 
  they only do because they 're burning through that cash at such a dizzying speed $ 140b from feb '14 through last year out of $ 700b iirc . 
  it 's going to be interesting to watch , that 's for sure . 
  you * do * get real baby carrots - though they come with skin and sprout on top still ... 
  sheep milk is definitely better - i like sheep 's milk cheese generally in fact . 
  considering their population is ~ 20 % greater , that ~ 10 % higher gdp is n't quite as impressive though , is it ? 
  you 'd hope not , given the data was drawn from israeli government statistics . 
  saying the british actively supported zionist immigration right through to '48 is n't strictly accurate though - once the trickle became an unsupportable flood due to external events the british * did * attempt to slow immigration to a sustainable rate ; however , zionist criminal gangs and terrorist groups maintained a strong presence in the people smuggling racket and like that kept illegal immigration levels up . 
  looks like it might be falco from the * never ending story * , not a cat . 
  repost from like a week ago or something ... 
  does israel * want * to be attacked by hezbollah , because this is how you get attacked by hezbollah . 
  next week 's headline :, 
  ** thousands of civilian dead as israel retaliates massively for unprovoked hezbollah attacks . 
  `` we 're just defending ourselves against these terrorists who broke the cease fire '' claims pm . 
  it 's almost like these sweets are all made in the same factory and sometimes the wrong type gets bagged in with others . 
  of course the real explanation - that individual pieces visit other bags to party while on the shelves - is much more mundane . 
  i 'm thinking you just have a small head op ? 
  petrol at the pump - one day the same fuel can cost you significantly more per litre than it did the day before with literally no change to the product . 
  are hezb * really * terrorist though is , i guess , the question . 
  they have been linked with terrorism in the past , but then they 're not alone in that regard regionally now , are they ? 
  in southern lebanon they function as a de facto government , providing schools , clinics and other services as well as defence for the population . 
  i would like to see the rhetoric between hezbollah and israel ratcheted down a few notches - surely it would work to the benfit of both ? 
  i feel that in that regard the syrian civil war is a lost opportunity for hezbollah and israel to redefine their relationship and normalise it significantly . 
  of course israel alone ca n't be blamed for this - hezbollah are equally responsible for ongoing tensions , though i must say assassinations like this really do n't give either side a chance to reduce tensions with the other . 
  another war on israel 's northern border really would be another tragedy , for all parties involved . 
  a lot of the issues with the f-35 have now been resolved - this is a good decision for both nato and denmark . 
  as well as the cost benefits associated with economies of scale , a heavily f-35 weighted nato air arm should provide an excellent capability as all aircraft become nodes in a network of sensors and shooters with advanced capabilities . 
  the danes have provided a lot of support in both afghanistan and against isis , their military is very well trained and they are n't scared to get their kit dirty . 
  geraffes , though not in old-school , low-roofed little pubs of course . 
  so would i - i was n't prepared for quite how cute they are the first time i saw one , but they really are adorable . 
  australian too ? 
  the swings in price seem to be especially vicious here ... ( they were worse until the government regulated it a bit , in wa at least - is that a federal or state law anyone ? ), 
  yeah it 's bs how barrel price increases hit the pump immediately , while price falls `` take time to filter down as stocks purchased at the old price are sold first '' ... 
  with sweet [ technology like the x-37b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_x-37 ) you can see why the us is n't interested in such a ban . 
  i mean nobody will publicly state the spaceplane 's exact mission , but we can make some assumptions of potential capabilities from what we * do * know and i think that disabling enemy satellites would be well within those bounds . 
  i bet they would , given china 's behaviour in the south china sea . 
  there have been pitches made to the vietnamese by us weapons manufacturers in recent times , but i am guessing those were probably for dual-use technologies . 
  the vietnamese possess some good , modern russian weapons systems ( eg submarines with land-attack cruise missiles , su-30 flanker fighters and etc ) , but i 'm sure there are capability gaps the us could fill better as well as the fact it would be a great advantage to not have exactly the same systems as the chinese buy from russia too . 
   hezbollah targets civilians , israel targets militants . 
  that 's very simplistic and not at all accurate - israel kills vastly more civilians than hezbollah ever has ( more civilians were killed in the israeli invasion of lebanon alone than israeli civilians have been killed since israel was created ) , whilst most of hezbollah 's attacks for many years have been against the idf , and in retaliation for incidents such as this what 's more . 
  if you want to dredge up the ghost of terrorism past let 's do that - starting with a discussion about irgun , the stern gang and the other zionist extremists seeing as that 's where modern terrorism first began ... 
  [ are you * quite * *** sure *** about that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deir_yassin_massacre ) ? 
  so is what you 're saying is that of the opinion that continued war is better than israel making some effort towards ending their conflict with hezbollah ? 
   this thread will be buried soon . 
  at least * you * acknowledge any thread that kicks off by daring to question israel 's actions will get buried quickly i guess . 
  * haganah * was a response to the zionist colonisers need for a defence force to protect them from the consequences of their actions - irgun and the stern gang were always offensively orientated , lashing out against the british , arabs and even jews with whom they disagreed ( or who just got in the way ) alike ... 
  please stop with the revisionism . 
  after a certain point who was targeted becomes less significant than the actual outcome , in a moral sense at the very least . 
  ultimately the decision to continue attacking targets despite knowing that there * will * be severe civilian deaths as `` collateral damage '' is effectively no different from just aiming straight at them - it 's just semantics . 
   ah ... not , i just see the upvote/downvote count . 
  not everything is a conspiracy . 
  sometimes , i think i 'd love to live in your bubble for a day or two . 
  nice strawman there - i did n't say it was a conspiracy , just something that happens . 
  i guess you never heard of mirrors , but i think you should look at one soon . 
  please , give me an example of my indulging in revisionism . 
  that 's nonsense , not objective history . 
  the zionist terror attacks predated the declaration of the israeli state - at that point the various zionist terrorist organisations were publicly condemned whilst quietly being absorbed into the idf , their members rewarded with military rank and pay , going on to commit the worst excesses during the horrors of the zionist grab for land in ' 47 - ' 48 . 
  moving on to israel 's creation , the zionists did n't `` accept '' - there was n't even anything to accept as before the un proposal could be ratified before the zionist forces started taking the area mooted by force , the trigger which provoked the arab nations ' reaction in '48 that the israeli narrative so disingenuously paints as an unprovoked , genocidal `` war of extermination '' ... 
  again , please stick to the facts - not the propaganda narrative . 
  have you drunk any other batches ? 
  if so how do you think this compares ? 
  i agree strongly with your point about letting this breathe to get the full range of flavour from this whisky - it really does make a massive difference . 
  sigh . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_partition_plan_for_palestine ) :, 
   the united nations partition plan for palestine was a ** proposal ** by the united nations , which ** recommended ** a partition of mandatory palestine ** at the end of the british mandate ** . 
  on 29 november 1947 , the u.n. general assembly adopted the plan as resolution 181 ( ii ) . 
   ** the resolution recommended the creation of independent arab and jewish states and a special international regime for the city of jerusalem ** . 
  the partition plan , a ** four-part document ** attached to the resolution , provided for the ** termination of the mandate , the progressive withdrawal of british armed forces and the delineation of boundaries between the two states and jerusalem ** . 
  part i of the plan stipulated that the mandate would be terminated as soon as possible and the united kingdom would withdraw no later than 1 august 1948 . 
  the new states would come into existence two months after the withdrawal , but no later than 1 october 1948 . 
  the plan sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims of two competing movements , palestinian nationalism and jewish nationalism , or zionism . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ** the plan also called for economic union between the proposed states , and for the protection of religious and minority rights . 
   the plan was accepted by the jewish agency for palestine , despite its perceived limitations . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] arab leaders and governments rejected it [ 7 ] and indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division , [ 8 ] arguing that ** it violated the principles of national self-determination in the un charter which granted people the right to decide their own destiny . 
   ** immediately after adoption of the resolution by the general assembly , a civil war broke out [ 10 ] and the plan was not implemented . 
  so , to summarise :, 
  - the un resolution adopted was a * proposal for a plan * , a plan that was not subsequently followed whatsoever, 
  - the civil war that marked `` israel 's acceptance of the partition '' ( note , as above there was a plan to accept - ** not ** a partition , most of which was ignored in favour of violent seizure of the territory mooted ) prevented the orderly ending of the mandate or the peaceful creation of the two states , let alone economic union between the states - the fact that hte arabs had not accepted the plan is rendered moot by the zionist 's behaviour, 
  - in any case , the partition was already legally very shaky , due to the un 's own charter defining people 's right to decide their own destiny, 
   the trigger is their racism .
