  i knew about the flag referendum ( it was in the news here , talked about on reddit of course and i was in nz at easter - just after the event ) , but i 'd never seen that design . 
  it 's a good one though , i reckon i 'd have voted for it . 
  yes , in 2012 iirc, 
  the bbc did not write * that * title . 
  i did n't know you got graffiti in india .

  the purple and white diagonally striped ribbon looks like it 's for a [ distinguished flying cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distinguished_flying_cross_ ( united_kingdom ) , ca n't help with the others though , sorry . 
  i believe the current theory is that the sami stayed in northern europe , separated from other european populations by the ice throughout the last ice age . 
  the finns are apparently a subgroup of the sami who became separated from the other sami and mingled with other , slavic and germanic , peoples . 
  both dna analysis and linguistics bear this out iirc . 
  in any case the sami/finns seem to have lived in scandinavia for much longer than the swedes . 
  nice explorer - i have one too , but not as old and with a steel band . 
  yours is cooler , i must say . 
  that must be a very early example . 
  it took me longer than it should have to realise this a ** spot on ** [ cosplay of ] margaery tyrell , not a spot ** on ** margaery tyrell [ the character played by natalie dormer ) . 
  i was like `` where 's the spot , i do n't see it '' ... 
  it seems incredible that such archaic views have not only survived in pockets of israeli society , but actually become so mainstream . 
  the thought of a government made up of the likes of such unapologetic bigots as netanyahu , lieberman , bennett , shaked , akunis and smotrich holding power in a nuclear armed state is literally terrifying - much more so that any lone-wolf attacker with a knife could ever hope to be . 
  ironically , [ the word `` slave '' is derived from slav ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave ) , as so many slavs were bought and sold by conquering peoples . 
  it is crazy in the sense that anyone who advocates ethnic cleansing - even this relatively benign form of ethnic cleansing - has to be at least a * little * crazy . 
  it 's not a creative interpretation in slightest , to quote [ jpost ] (,

   `` the holocaust should bring us to ponder our public lives and , furthermore , it must lead anyone who is capable of taking public responsibility to do so , '' golan said . 
  `` because if there is one thing that is scary in remembering the holocaust , it is noticing horrific processes which developed in europe -- particularly in germany -- 70 , 80 , and 90 years ago , and finding remnants of that here among us in the year 2016 '', 
  maybe he means an * illegally * settled question ? 
  after all , that is the israeli way . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i do n't support the bds movement because their stated goals include israel 's destruction ( which imho is going too far - if they could limit their goals to freeing palestine from israeli oppression they would be morally unarguable ) , but i have * never * heard of them bashing every jew on-site unless he fully renounce israel . 
  that really does sound absolutely appalling - i would very much like to read about these occurrences !, 
  slave is derived from slave , not slav from slave . 
  most slaves were slavs , but not all slavs were slaves . 
  ugh , * gross * !, 
  i do n't want to flush using someone else 's dirty hand water . 
  to be fair , indians seem to hate everyone - white people ( better than indians - they hate that ) , africans ( worse than indians , to be looked down on ) , chinese ( enemies ) , muslims ( enemies ) . 
  i guess they get along * ok * with the russians . 
  please note i personally do n't think indians are better or worse than any other race - i was just explaining how their world view comes across . 
  that 's because of how volatile iced tea is - heavyweight cans are legally mandated to prevent injury . 
  watch * the wire * - that 's set in the nice parts of baltimore .

  sorry , but when you say you 'd only had one bar do you mean one xanax ? 
  at $ 15.30 p/h for 40hrs per week you earn ~ $ 600 p/w gross . 
  if you lose 18 % of that you still get nearly $ 500 p/w net . 
  as each month has at least four weeks you will get at least $ 2000 per month . 
  how do you make it that you need to work 40hrs a week to earn $ 1000 ? 
  do you even need bacon on the table after so much sausage in the mouth ? 
  i was a little out because i just did it in my head very quickly , but only by $ 36.80 that i underestimated . 
  so written out and checked by calculator here it is ( assuming 18 % tax rate as stated by the comment i replied to ) :, 
  ( $ 612 - $ 110.16 ) * 4 = $ 2,036.80 ( february month take home , other months will be more . ), 
  i do n't know exactly what your cool story about working fewer hours whilst being paid less per hour has to do with working that out , but may i suggest * you * check * your * math ? 
  thanks - i did n't want to sound like a jerk asking , but i just thought it sounded really out of synch with the rest of what you wrote . 
  it was such a positive story that what seemed to be a casual drug reference thrown into it like it was no biggie was a bit jarring !, 
  it sounds like you had a great time . 
  i 'm not at that point yet where i genuinely do n't care what people think , though i am a bit younger still and certainly trying . 
  what you wrote about how you constrained yourself for your sons ' embarrassment 's sake made me hope i have never made my mum feel like that ( though no doubt i probably did ) and resolve to go out of my way to do do something nice for her today . 
  ( we get along well , but it 's always good to be nice to mum . ), 
  i think all cities above a certain size ( and it does n't have to be that large ) have their no-go zones , especially for na\u00efve ( in terms of that culture , if not generally ) tourists . 
  paris is beautiful and i quite agree with you about visiting it . 
  you do realise that the higher tax rate only applies to the amount you earn over the threshold ? 
  that means , in financial terms , it 's better to earn more per hour , even if you enter a higher tax bracket because you earn more money . 
  it feels odd to be explaining this . 
  perhaps i misread your reply . 
  hey , i had reasons man ... 
  liberman in charge of the west bank as minister of defence is a grim prospect for peace that will surely lead to further and even more unrestrained violence . 
  the israeli cabinet is increasingly a rogues gallery of extreme right ideologues - bennett , shaked , liberman , akunis ... 
  ya'alon was pretty hard right himself - for him to remove himself from their company is a telling indictment . 
  the only thing threatened in israel by international attitudes is their illegal settlement of the west bank . 
  if that was ended there would be some chance of a peace agreement . 
  israel is not the victim . 
  the right-wing know that the violence cements their grip on power and ability to continue their political agenda of expansionism and ethnic cleansing in the west bank , so they keep the tension high with blatant provocations such as settlement expansion . 
  you have cause and effect mixed-up . 
  she sure does . 
  the tablets are shaped like little bars and so people call them bars . 
  xanax can make people uninhibited . 
  i just could n't work out what was meant by only having one bar ( which is what the original typo read as , now corrected to beer ) is all . 
  it 's certainly not the jewish israelis ' fault in any way , is it ? 
  of course not - * nothing * ever is . 
  not every country votes right-wing extremists into government though , as israeli is wont to do . 
  the israeli security forces generally have been one of the few voices able to speak out against the regime 's ( or rather successive regimes ' ) worst excesses - not just army generals , or iasdf pilots , but also the former heads of both shin bet and mossad have all spoken out against the occupation , warmongering with iran and other issues . 
  however , the idf/shine bet/mossad leadership of professionals is increasingly at odds with the the current draftees , as personified by elor azariah ( aka the mad executioner of hebron ) who increasingly * are * right-wing extremists , especially since the moves to include more haredim in military service . 
  this is , in fact , an issue the leadership are very concerned about . 
  i have even read some idf leaders fear their units may already be ideologically incapable of carrying out orders to remove illegal settlers . 
  that is a gross oversimplification of the dynamic , as i am sure you are quite aware . 
  you say choose not to serve as though there are no moral issues involved for arab israelis , or as if they would n't suffer discrimination themselves from the likes of israel 's poster boy for military tolerance , elor azariah . 
  i 'm glad * you 're * here to sort this mess out , u/tayaravaknin , but unfortunately in this case your argument does n't hold water . 
  i live in australia and have n't heard * anyone * call anyone else from out polity a fascist . 
  in fact it only happens in the other countries you mention to , you know , right-wing extremist parties - not the government - and/or coming from extremists , not the former pm . 
  the simple fact is that israel is currently ruled by ultra-nationalist , right-wing extremists who are slowly , but steadily moving further and further to the right , led by those baying lunatics the jewish home and shoved from behind by netanyahu . 
  this is not * my * opinion , but rather that of israel 's own military leadership and the saner of her politicians . 
  you should work in video production - i hear they 're hiring for `` three girls , one cup '' atm . 
  i hear pressurised cans are another popular alternative stateside too . 
  given azariah 's religious nationalist background and supporters it is entirely reasonable to label him as a racist . 
  remember that jewish home - the most visible and powerful religious nationalist group , though far from the most extreme - politicians such as smotrich , shaked and bennett openly call for ethnic cleansing , separation of jewish and palestinians and even genocide it is near impossible to credit any of their adherents would distinguish between `` good '' israeli citizen , even idf-serving , palestinians and `` bad '' ones living in the wb . 
  given no such distinction has ever been made in their rhetoric ( actually quite the opposite in fact ) , why would their be in their private thoughts and behaviours ? 
  indeed people tend towards being significantly more extreme when they think people are n't watching . 
  hazing is a problem in all militaries - even those where such issues of racial superiority are not a problem among the rank and file . 
  now , if you have any proof that the religious nationalists do n't mean what they say , that the idf * is n't * suffering the issues its leaders have talked about from the recent religious nationalist influx it has absorbed since the haredim were integrated into the armed forces or that the idf , uniquely among armies , has 100 % eliminated bullying in its ranks please enlighten me . 
  i am always happy to be proved wrong . 
  if indeed i am of course . 
  how can a single poster brigade a sub ?
