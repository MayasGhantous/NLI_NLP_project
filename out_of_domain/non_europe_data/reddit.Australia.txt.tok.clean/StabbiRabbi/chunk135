  what a great image . 
  some soviet art is quite attractive , like this with its use of colour and perspective . 
  i 'd actually like a print of this to hang in my flat . 
  why not every hour ? 
  what * are * you talking about ? 
  there is no accusation that the murdered terrorist did any worse than only wound * his * victim . 
  it 's * you * calling him murderer , no one else . 
  terrorist and murderer are not synonymous . 
  the difference between him and his murderer is he has been denied the opportunity to defend himself - we can draw our own conclusions about the events based on the videos and later apologise , if necessary . 
  it still says a lot about your worldview that you could even consider comparing this particular terrorist and literally stalin . 
  edit : look idgaf whether i call him the murderous medic or the allegedly murderous medic , so let 's go with allegedly murderous medic if it makes you happy . 
  none of that changes the point more people turned out to support him than protest lieberman 's appointment and ergo the extreme right-wing displayed greater numbers than the moderates . 
  that was the point , not the allegedly murderous medic 's precise legal status at this point in time . 
  i did n't say it existed - i said it was a reason for israeli arabs not to serve . 
  even if it only a fear it is a justified fear , given the impunity with which the idf kills arabs . 
  however , yes . 
  given that it is such an endemic issue the onus here would be to prove there is * no * bullying in the idf . 
  some parasites , like [ giardia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giardia ) infect humans directly from water , but not dogs . 
  ( dogs catch giardia , but from other infected animals via their faeces . ), 
  he 's not unique as a black man from the caribbean plantations who became a figure in french society of the period - alexandre dumas , author of * the count of monte christo * - was the son of another such person , [ thomas-alexandre dumas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas-alexandre_dumas ) , a nobleman who became a revolutionary period general . 
  there is an excellent book about his life , [ * the black count * ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_black_count:_glory,_revolution,_betrayal,_and_the_real_count_of_monte_cristo ) which gives a great look into the period . 
  will they post kittens to perth ? 
  you must be wet not to know * that * !, 
  ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  dear god , i hope not . 
  huh , and i thought america was the most lgbt friendly nation on earth ( per capita ) . 
  consumerism , i think too many people place too much importance in crap , and how much crap they possess . 
  no , unfortunately . 
  it 's a shame things did n't work out that way , i know some people involved had the best of intentions in that regard , and many israelis do to this day . 
  i agree the real right-wing swing in israel has been very recent , there have always been right wing elements , but it was much more balanced before . 
  let 's hope things swing back to the centre . 
  only in nice parts of moscow . 
  rest of country is a shithole . 
  oh , i 'm glad they cleared that up . 
  i would have been lost without the explanation , lost i tell you !, 
  no point - surely that 's a pin ? 
  you should sue . 
  no strong typing if you do n't want strong typing , no inheritance or polymorphism , classes are just `` modules '' with a different name , overly simplistic `` on error resume next '' exception handling , goto still a language feature ... 
  hang on , wait - those are * bad * things . 
  sorry , actually idk . 
  it seems that way to me too ( as another gen x'er ) ; i do n't think the baby boomers have `` stolen '' anyone 's money , i just think the implications of policies made years ago were n't properly understood at the time they were implemented and some of them have had negative side-effects . 
  in any case , as the children of boomers we stand to inherit whatever is left . 
  the article discusses increasing lifespans and the associated costs - if more is taken from the boomers then those costs will increasingly be drawn from the public purse , instead of self-funded . 
  should there be some consideration of these matters ? 
  of course - nothing should be a sacred cow , totally off-limits . 
  does it make sense to pull the rug from under retirees feet now ? 
  i would argue not . 
  tbh i really do n't get all this bitterness towards the boomers - it smacks to me of sour grapes . 
  i am towards the very end of gen x and am affected by the same housing price issues as everyone else although i do own my own place ( well , the bank owns much of it , but i 'm on the ladder ... ) - the fact is that housing in places like london makes ours look positively reasonable . 
  if anyone has screwed us all over it 's the banks , not the boomers as a generation . 
  yeah - i think that nails the issue , and this inter-generational shit-stirring is a distraction to pull the wool over peoples ' eyes so they do n't see it . 
  i come from a comfortably off family , went to a good school and have enjoyed many of the privileges of that background and upbringing - particularly having been able to enter a career i really enjoy that positions me above the median in terms of income . 
  however , i share your misgivings about the increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots entirely and consider it a pressing social issue that harms every single one of us , whether wealthy , comfortable or on the bloody dole * except * those who are capitalising on the structural economic and policy issues causing the divide . 
  i do n't want to live in an unfair society , even if i have a better than average chance of personally making it over to the comfortable side of the tracks . 
  i think the social security safety net is vital to the health of our society as a whole and should n't be bastardised and worn away in favour of rich people getting richer . 
  there are plenty of young , spoiled scions of wealthy families who bear more responsibility than ordinary , middle-class boomers imo . 
  as i said before , it 's the banks ( and their big-business buddies ) who have screwed us . 
  of course !, 
  when israelis propose crazy , racist policy it 's just empty rhetoric and should be treated as such . 
  not like those evil iranians , or the palestinians whose every word about israelis must be taken totally seriously , despite the fact they could n't wipe out israel if they tried !, 
  of course it 's been the status quo in isreal and the occupied territories for some time , the rest of the world just are n't as comfortable with it as israelis are is all . 
  asking the important questions here !, 
  hmmm , a rainbow street leading to a massive phallic symbol - what could it all mean ? 
  charlize rocks , definitely one of my favourite actresses . 
  [ streetlamp le moose ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/jlao6/so_my_wife_just_agreed_to_name_our_unborn_son/c2d21qe ), 
  horrific - what 's the excuse going to be * this * time ? 
  this really is horrendous , and makes the brutal truth behind yair golan and moshe ya'alon 's warning words about the dangers inherent in israeli society 's vicious right-wing swing all too apparent . 
  i wonder , will these rogue policemen be charged and , if so , what will * their * supporters claim as justification for this brutal crime ? 
  elor azariah 's apologists argued he `` just '' killed a terrorist : how will * this * be explained away ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  then future dictator sulla was awarded a grass crown by his men , a mark of his brilliance as a general that could * only * be awarded by the troops he commanded . 
  are you making the excuse or describing how it 's likely to go ? 
  so why did the up to ten assailants , including other off-duty police , reported * all * have to pile in and beat him half to death , even if he did throw a punch ( also not in the reports ) ? 
  why is there nothing about him being under investigation in any of the reports ? 
  if he was actually under investigation and this happened in the course of that then why was it off-duty border police who assaulted him at his work ? 
  i think the excuse still needs some polishing ... 
  i have commented based * purely * on what was actually reported , in both this piece and haaretz 's article on the incident . 
  it 's * you * who 's engaging in conjecture - what do * you * know the media does n't ? 
  fair enough , let 's hope this goes to court then . 
  i mean , the articles ( did you read them ? ), 
  do describe * exactly * what i wrote , but hey - witnesses * do * sometimes `` change their mind '' or `` become forgetful '' about incidents like this , so it might well be a whole different story after the police have had time to sort out exactly what occurred , right ? 
  ( that 's what you 're talking about , is n't it ? ), 
  yeah , i mean maybe he tripped and fell ? 
  well , sheeeeit , what them thais need to do is not pay their waiters an actual wage , but make them do tricks for tips instead . 
  * everyone * knows that 's how you get good service out of people . 
  no , i get it - sorry , i was just messing around . 
  you 're quite right - we do n't know all the facts yet , and perhaps the reports are wrong . 
  whatever else its faults , israel does have a fairly good record of at least bringing security force members who are accused of such offences to trial , even if the sentences given out do sometimes seem a little light . 
  the idf , shin bet and mossad have all shown themselves capable of going against their political masters ' grain , as we most recently saw with yair galon 's holocaust memorial day speech and i do not doubt this will be investigated despite the worrying trend towards right-wing politics in israel we are currently observing . 
  i hope the two of us are correct in what we have both now written and this does get properly and publicly investigated . 
  i believe it will , and will be much happier if the police involved are innocent of wrongdoing than if they 're not i can assure you . 
  i have read only * war and peace * from this list , but did not find it incredibly tough in any sense whatsoever . 
  yes , it was long , but the edition i read was multiple volumes and i enjoyed it way too much to consider it an `` extreme read '' . 
  that said , kant * has * intimidated me to an extent , despite my interest in his ideas as absorbed via secondary sources . 
  if , however , kant is comparable to * war and peace * then maybe i should give him a crack in his own words . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i 'm just going to say it 's very interesting how * all * the posts itt , bar one that takes the piss out of hillary , have been heavily downvoted , despite the total lack of * any * of the downvoting apologists poking their heads in here to argue the commenters being downvoted are wrong . 
  they know they ca n't , they do n't have a leg to stand on , so bravely just click the downvote arrow as viciously as they possibly can . 
  hilarious how he thinks the `` consumption '' people used to die of is something to do with eating/drinking - not tuberculosis , or consumption as it was commonly known . 
  way to set la causa back , she should have just publicly eaten a steak for veganism in times square or something .
