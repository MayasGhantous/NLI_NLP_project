  try submitting your links to specific subreddits : i see you posted a picture of some delicious looking tikka to r/pics - instead of that sub try r/food . 
  cross-posting ( posting the same link to multiple subs ) is actively encouraged so why not submit that same picture to r/food ? 
  i 'd upvote it there , though tbh i would n't in r/pics . 
  yes , it is a pic , but it 's a * food * pic , so that 's where it belongs . 
  to get comment karma just comment a bit for a while and you 'll soon learn what constitutes good comment content . 
  saying something insightful is best , or funny . 
  puns ( groan ) * usually * go down well . 
  ultimately though the best thing is to not care about karma - just join in the discussion and karma will follow . 
  personally i do n't chase imaginary internet points , they just accumulate from conversation . 
  if you want ~ 15k comment karma + ~ 1.5 k link karma i would sell this account to you in a heartbeat , but honestly it really is n't necessary for you to consider such an option . 
  go forth and type , grasshopper . 
  wtf man ? 
  you are * the only commenter * to ~ ~ break ~ ~ fulfill godwin 's law here , so far at least . 
  indeed , who else has mentioned apartheid or genocide for that matter ? 
  fascism is the * only * element of your laundry list rant that * has * been mentioned , and i would argue that given the current context of news stories about israel ( ie elor azaria murder , yair golan 's fascism holocaust memorial day speech , moshe ya'alon resignation ) fascism is a perfectly reasonable concept to mention , particularly in a thread discussing a racially motivated hate crime committed by security forces ... 
  edit : changed wording thanks to u/sahuxley2 's comment about phrasing below . 
  gold - now that 's what * i * call service !, 
  this is exactly what i suspected . 
  i have no academic background in philosophy and have always expected kant to be much more technical than tolstoy , quality of writing quite aside . 
  tbh i do n't know . 
  i only * know * sulla and scipio africanus were awarded them - it really was n't a common decoration at all , which is why i mentioned it in relation to sulla . 
  obviously honour upon honour was heaped upon sulla when he was dictator , but the grass crown could * only * be awarded by troops in the field so imo the grass crown is more impressive than anything the senate voted him - or any of the later caesars - following bouts of proscription and in the midst of rule by force . 
  julius caesar is definitely the type of leader i could see being awarded a grass crown by his troops though , maybe at alesia when he defeated vercingetorix ? 
  that 's the best , when they get all hot under the collar , is n't it ? 
  for citizens of the greatest nation , like , ever ^ ^ ^ tm they sure are thin-skinned !, 
  i think that 's a fair point , and hope you recognise my previous comment 's style as being somewhat tongue-in-cheek . 
  i have to say the violence of the swing to the right politically in israel is pretty scary to watch as an interested observer , but i do believe there are enough checks and balances in the israeli system to prevent any demagogue like lieberman going too far ; however , sometimes events can degenerate more quickly than anticipated . 
  erdogan is doing pretty well at wearing down attaturk 's secular institutions in turkey that had always seemed unassailable - i sincerely hope the same is not achieved in israel . 
  although turkey has not succumbed to the religious fundamentalists push for a sharia theocracy , it is scarily close . 
  israel is not there yet , but more violence ( perhaps provoked by the right deliberately ) would almost certainly erode the bulwarks you mentioned . 
  unfortunately the cororolly to your point about the extremity of the palestinians ' warcries is that lieberman 's death penalty policy is so much more easily achieved than the destruction of israel by hamas . 
  i know you 're a regular poster in r/israel and whilst you are to the right of me , i do n't think you 're anything like lieberman or the jewish home from your comments i have read ( i hope not , at least ) , especially as you 're willing to converse and not just downvote . 
  it 's people like you , not people like me , who ultimately will have the chance to stop that swing to the extreme right and so i do n't want to argue with you - fundamentally i think we probably agree on more than we would argue about . 
  please do n't take all my comments too seriously - i support both sides equally when push comes to shove ( or am equally critical of both if you 're a glass-half-empty kind of person ) , but will always argue against ideologues . 
  tbh i just ca n't help myself . 
  ( i always call out anti-semites too btw . ), 
  i think many in the us are a bit more comfortable with aspects of it than i am tbh , or most australians , nz ` ers or europeans are for that matter , but the us still less than israel by a long stretch . 
  just my opinion of course and no blanket statement can fairly be uniformly applied across any population . 
  what do you mean `` without being more wrong '' ? 
  wow , where did * that * com from ? 
  i 've been right though our conversation and this is completely out of the blue . 
  sorry , but you 've lost me , i * really * ca n't follow your meaning here . 
  in this case , from what the reports say , i think the * only * thing the victim was suspected of was being a muslim arab , so i guess that makes him guilty as charged ( in the eyes of people like the guy you replied to at least ... ) ? 
  [ whisky galore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whisky_galore_ ( novel \\ ) ) , after the wonderful compton mackenzie novel . 
  i love the look of the f-4g , and they 're a fascinating aircraft with a crucial mission , flown by very brave crews . 
  really interesting shot !, 
  ah , so this is about you not getting yours , so let 's take from others ? 
  when the wealth has been adjusted so * you * are sitting in * your * obscenely expensive pile i assume you 'll be agitating to change the rules back because , er , idk , * other people previously had benefited from the welfare system despite having a house to live in and it 's unfair you are n't getting to too * , or something ? 
  [ here 's their website ] ( http://www.brickarms.com/index.php ) , with a pretty cool range of weapons and uniforms . 
  i do n't think americans really * get * yoghurt - the only well known us brand is chobani , which is a pretty new company . 
  they make * ok * yoghurt , but in australia - as in europe - we get a really good selection of all different kinds of yoghurt . 
  personally , i like greek style yoghurt the best , and have to say some of the best yoghurt i have ever eaten was in greece , as a dessert . 
  absolutely delicious !, 
  i think that finding a truly unbiased source is going to be pretty much impossible - what i can suggest is instead reading from both sides so you can make your own mind up , choosing the least extreme/most reasonable of each side 's sources . 
  for example , to learn more about the circumstances of the '67 war ( six-day war ) and ensuing occupation i read both norman finkelstein 's book [ * image and reality of the israel-palestine conflict * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/image_and_reality_of_the_israel%e2%80%93palestine_conflict ) * and * michael oren 's [ * six days of war * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six_days_of_war ) , with finkelstein representing the international view of the history , while oren projects the standard israeli narrative . 
  neither books are the diatribe of an absolute flaming ideologue and by reading both you can gain a reasonably balanced and complete picture of the different perspectives . 
  what concerns me about it is that jewish israelis seem increasingly willing to violently deal with non-jewish israelis at any provocation , then excuse and dismiss such assaults even when they are clearly not legal or justifiable in any sense whatsoever . 
  one expects a civilised society to view vigilante-style violence as being simply not socially acceptable , but in israel we have seen incidents such as the eritrean man being attacked `` mistakenly '' , the hebron stab-attacker being executed by elor azaria extra-judicially and now this , all in very close succession and all finding plenty of apologists and defenders . 
  coupled with the increasingly extreme right-wing nature of israeli politics it all combines to paint a very dark picture of where the society is potentially headed . 
  it 's important to not shy away from discussing these events because extremism and bigotry flourishes when shielded from examination , but is weakened by exposure . 
  i hope israeli society never becomes as bad as various public figures in israel have expressed fears that it 's becoming , but without a willingness to confront these situations and discuss them the chances of things getting * really * bad increase massively . 
  i think you 're right actually - i typed that out in a hurry , on my phone and did n't consider the phrasing , but fulfilling certainly sounds more apt than breaking . 
  i 'm going to edit my comment , but in a way that does n't orphan your comment so it stops making sense . 
  a solid , typically american , argument backed up with the even stronger point that :, 
   black people are less likely to be qualified for receiving grants since they are genetically less intelligent than whites . 
  smh . 
  idk , maybe it 's just me , but i find it hard to believe this guy is any more intellectually blessed than almost anyone else , given the quality of both his reasoning * and * the language he uses to express it . 
  for example ( corrections are emphasised and my own ) :, 
   this is completely meaningless . 
  there are 4-5 times more white students than black students in ~ ~ universities of ~ ~ * universities , of * course black people receive ~ ~ less ~ ~ * fewer * scholarships ~ ~ , ~ ~ if there are ~ ~ less ~ ~ * fewer * of them in college . 
  if equality is the end goal then black people should receive 4-5 [ * times * ] ~ ~ less ~ ~ * fewer * scholarships than white people [ * do * ] . 
  if this guy 's a member of some kind of master race , as he seems to believe , then i genuinely fear for the rest of us !, 
  i bought dad a little roman glass perfume bottle for his birthday last month , in similar condition ( albeit smaller ) to the image you posted . 
  roman glassware is great and nice to be able to pick up because it is relatively rare ( compared to pottery for example ) due to its fragility . 
  it always amazes me looking at such things that something so fine could be manufactured * such * a long time ago and that it 's survived to this day . 
  does n't transnistria contain almost all of the industrial infrastructure from the former moldovan ssr ? 
  iirc that 's why russia supported its separation from moldova and stations their `` peacekeeping forces '' there . 
  i always thought of russia more like a chihuahua - yappy and aggressive , but not as tough as it thinks it is . 
  not if they want to stay out of the reeducation camps they wo n't . 
  the guy 's a goldmine . 
   how many times will i have to * prove * you wrong ? 
  try for once first . 
  that 's a great start !, 
   the plan would reduce both the arab population of israel and the jewish population of the west bank , creating more ethnically homogeneous states without anyone moving, 
  so he 's in favour of peace , just so long as it includes strict segregation following ethnic cleansing . 
  nice guy . 
  i actually had n't previously considered transnistria in the context of the other `` breakaway republics '' , largely because there has n't been any actual conflict ( at least that i 'm aware of ) associated with the region , but it does make sense to view it in the same light as donbas or ingushetia . 
  the nato charter actually specifically forbids new states with * any * unresolved border issues from joining nato - that in and of itself would be enough to drive putin 's behaviour , given russia 's longstanding fears of western encirclement ( pre-dating nato by a long time , but obviously greatly exacerbated by natos slow spread eastwards in europe ) . 
  remember - the settlers do n't even have to be israeli citizens when they first move into their illegal homes to enjoy all the freedoms and protections of an israeli citizen squatting in the wb , they just have to be jewish . 
  any jew can pick up israeli citizenship immediately and simply , whereas there is no path for a palestinian who is not currently already an israeli citizen ( other than the residents of east jerusalem ) to acquire israeli citizenship at all . 
  this fact alone makes a mockery of the citizenship , not religio-ethnic identity argument posited above ... 
   i consider webmd to be a legitimate source on medical facts, 
  so , what form of self-diagnosed cancer did you find out * you * have ? 
  i would counter that only someone obsessed with semantics , as a tool of distraction from the main issue at hand , would argue that * anything * designed to create ethnically homogeneous enclaves could possibly be anything other than ethnic cleansing . 
  ethnic cleansing is * not * genocide !, 
  the difference , if you google `` ethnic cleansing '' , is defined as such :, 
   ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or ` population transfer ' whereas genocide is the `` intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic , religious , or national group . '', 
  moving the boundaries has the same effect as moving the people , ergo it most definitely * is * ethnic cleansing . 
  what does `` bring clever '' mean ? 
  i thought , admittedly from reading reddit which i know can be misleading , that israelis * hated * sweden and its social model ?
