  here , you dropped this : *** opaganda ***, 
   because all comparisons are somehow islamophobic and unnecessary now ? 
  no , not necessarily . 
  in this particular case , however , * your * comparison was * certainly * unnecessary and whilst not islamophobic had distinctly racist overtones towards palestinians and saudi arabians . 
  your comment was just another `` manipulation by distraction '' effort , a standard tactic in your personal playbook whenever the murky details of israeli society are held up to the light . 
  as i have said recently in response to the report advocating acceptance of the arab peace initiative , israel 's security professionals are the sole voice of reason within the israeli establishment and their words really should be heeded by their political masters . 
  of course this is very unlikely at this point in time , given the rabid extremism of the current political masters ; however , we may all hope that halevy 's predictions about netanyahu losing his grip on power comes to pass and israeli politics can move back into the realms of sanity . 
  ah , a [ freeman of the land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemen_on_the_land ) . 
  these guys are hilarious . 
  my former housemate of nearly a decade ago now was right into all this stuff and explained it to me as fact ( albeit a highly disjointed set of facts ) long before i had even heard of sovcits , freemen of the land or any of the other ridiculous belief systems these people subscribe to . 
  he even used to buy silver to hoard , obviously not trusting currency because - as these guys believe - the governments of western nations such as canada , the uk , australia and nz are all operating whilst bankrupt since the gold standard was abandoned . 
  anyway , at the time i just thought to myself that i 'd just stick to the laws ( like a sucker ) because the whole thing sounded decidedly odd , not realising the significance of these interactions . 
  since finding out more about this stuff i genuinely regret not having had sufficient knowledge at the time to have capitalised on the resource i had literally living with me - it is , after all , one thing to * read * about this lunacy , but having been able to interrogate one of its practitioners would have been priceless !, 
  new , quieter technology ( [ such as is being investigated for sof dirtbikes ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-u-s-military-is-getting-serious-about-stealth-moto-1779663732 ) ) would be a big advantage . 
  even a squad 's worth of regular atvs are going to put out a lot of noise , but if that can be limited the practicality rises proportionally for patrolling and etc. 
  the food i ate in greece was , without exception , not only excellent , but also very good value ( especially compared to australia , where i live ) . 
  this looks great , and very much inline with the impressions i gained myself while over there . 
  er , they have been fighting an internal war with their taliban in the tribal areas continuously for many years now ... 
  idk - i have n't asked them . 
  you expressed your ignorance of a war being fought in pakistan , i just let you in on the one everyone else already knew about mate . 
  yes , yes : * now * i feel like `` an intellect '' . 
  i did n't actually say whether or not i thought any pakistani refugees were fleeing that conflict , but rather was just trying to help you out . 
  you did n't know about something ; i told you about it . 
  i really do n't understand what 's making you so salty . 
  whilst this is in and of itself certainly the correct moral stance for the eu to take , at this point in time israel needs to be handled quite carefully due to the increasing power of its totally crazy political extreme right wing . 
  unfortunately , policies such as this are grist for their mill as they feed into the victimhood/politics of fear false narrative that is their primary means of gaining and maintaining their influence . 
  simply talking about relations being harmed will not `` scare the current regime straight '' as it were ; they clearly have absolutely zero concern for foreign opinion and , as i previously mentioned , will simply portray this as thinly-veiled european anti-semitism . 
  the eu actually needs to implement swingeing sanctions , ideally targeted at individuals such as netanyahu , bennett et al in the same manner as the sanctions against putin 's regime . 
  by targeting these extremists personally the ordinary people of israel will not suffer and the accusation that the measures are simply poorly disguised anti-semitism will be severely weakened ( even among the aforementioned lunatics ' supporters ) while hopefully the leadership can be made to suffer sufficient personal hardships that they rethink their behaviour . 
  no , i think the noise of a platoon 's worth would make effective patrolling a difficult , not to mention dangerous , task . 
  evs , however , would significantly reduce the noise signature even for larger units , although of course the current endurance issues would require resolution . 
  i did not call you a racist ; i merely responded to your question . 
  i 'm not trying to smear you either , and am sorry if you feel that way : i simply called it like i saw it in response to the specific comment i replied to . 
  these discussions really do not need to be viewed as personal in nature whatsoever , and i am quite surprised that someone who is so keen to participate feels such a slight criticism so keenly . 
  fwiw i am aware you actually run a sub dedicated to monitoring and calling out islamophobia , although i must admit i have never visited it . 
  accordingly it seems unlikely to me that you are indeed an actual dyed-in-the-wool racist , or even that you particularly intended what you wrote to even sound racist . 
  nonetheless , in context and greatly aggravated by the sheer irrelevance of what you brought up to the matter at hand ( ie the behaviour of israel 's knesset ) , i still feel that particular comment did come across as being somewhat racist . 
  lots of fascinating things to see and do too , especially for anyone with an interest in history or the classics . 
  all round great place to visit imo . 
  their beer 's not bad either !, 
  i like the finish on the paint - from the photos it looks to me very much like the look of paint over real armour . 
  the weathering looks good too , not overdone . 
  princess clara and foxy brown from * drawn together * . 
  wtf does that * mean * , pootie ? 
  i do not think the israeli people are far right extremists by nature , or anything of the sort . 
  in fact , i am an avowed zionist who wholeheartedly supports israel 's right to ongoing self-determination and security and i often criticise anti-semites when i encounter them . 
  i merely have certain reservations about the illegal colonialist project in the wb and treatment of the palestinians generally , believing they too are possessed of the innate human right to self-determination and accordingly deserve to be freed from the jackboot of the occupation . 
  not that i owe you an explanation , but my username refers to the sicarii , the world 's first terrorists who went around stabbing their opponents in 1st century palestine ; they were also jewish religious fundamentalists , ergo literal stabby rabbis . 
  it 's intended as a commentary on the cyclical nature of violence , but most people do n't seem to get it - i guess not everyone is as interested in history as i am . 
  tbh so many people make the same silly mistake you appear to have that i would probably change it , if only reddit allowed me to do so . 
  ok , whatever man , you 're free to think whatever you like . 
  go through my history as much as you like , you wo n't find a single comment that is not supportive of israel 's right to exist . 
  a zionist is somebody who believes in israel 's right to exist ; i certainly fit the bill . 
  or do n't . 
   collective punishment was our response to the pa paying the families of terrorists . 
  finally !, 
  an israeli who actually admits collective punishment is practiced by israel as policy against innocent palestinians . 
  it 's like with men who beat their wives - even just admitting to the ~ ~ distasteful ~ ~ shameful behaviour is a massive first step . 
  good on you . 
  edit : changed a word . 
  thank you , i appreciate the kind words . 
  the more of us who can talk about these issues in a reasonable matter , the better . 
  there are still stern gang and irgun terrorists alive , who have streets named after them in israel ( indeed [ jabotinsky is the most popular street name in israel ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) !, 
  ) , and who are being paid pensions by the israeli government to this day ( nominally for their subsequent service in the idf once the official army welcomed the `` former '' terrorist thugs into its ranks , but does that * really * make any * moral * difference ? 
  * i * certainly think not ... ) . 
  for israel to righteously condemn this behaviour from the pa should n't these surviving zionist terrorists finally be brought to justice and imprisoned for their crimes ? 
  war crimes are often prosecuted decades after the events so doing so would not set any kind of precedent and , once these evil men had been locked up , with the keys thrown far away , israel * could * justifiably claim that the palestinians are behaving in a fundamentally worse manner than the zionists did . 
  however , until that happy day comes to pass israel bleating about the pa providing financial assistance to palestinian families who have lost a family member in the violence that surrounds the occupation and , much worse , collectively punishing those bereaved family members , really reeks of self-serving hypocrisy and oppression , would n't you agree ? 
  except for the remaining veterans of the stern gang and irgun who were later welcomed into the idf despite their vile personal histories of carrying out terrorist acts , of course ... 
  i mean sure , * technically * they would be counted as idf pensions , but the israeli government is , nonetheless , paying these `` former '' terrorists pensions . 
   consistent with an agile acquisition mindset designed to deliver the right capability on the required timeline , this aoa will include options to leverage rapid development and proto-typing in order to keep ahead of the threat . 
  idk , this could also refer to the recent discussions around fielding an updated f-22 before a true 6th-gen platform - there seems to be a shift towards evolutionary rather than revolutionary design and development from the usaf in the wake of the difficulties encountered developing both the f-35 and the f-22 itself . 
  that is the approach which has clearly been taken with the b-21 / lrs-b , which aims to minimise both cost and risks by leveraging existing designs/equipment instead of starting with a completely blank slate . 
  if that program demonstrates the approach to be effective ( or , conceivably has even already done so ) i would not be surprised to see it being adopted for other upcoming projects too . 
  if we can discount what happened a mere generation ago , then surely the whole zionist connection to the land is just so much hogwash then , is it ? 
  i mean , that was over 2,000 years ago , right ? 
  can you really make such deals ? 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't do so for the palestinians - i 'm a white , anglo , culturally christian bloke from australia after all , but i would certainly agree with those measures being taken against arafat and husseini ( and dependents as you mentioned ) as well as the zionist terrorists and their families . 
  i think you are letting your self-righteousness override your reading comprehension when you accuse me of * literally * excusing terrorism . 
  i was making a rhetorical point in the context of your one-sided , ( to my mind ) hypocritical condemnation of the palestinians for the exact same behaviour israel has continuously engaged in since the state was created . 
  if terrorists are evil then all terrorists are evil - not just those with whom you disagree - was my point . 
  personally i believe the same rules * should * apply to both sides equally and that neither can claim the moral high-ground exclusively . 
  there are rights and wrongs committed by both israelis and palestinians . 
  as for your penultimate paragraph , you are quite simply wrong . 
  no single palestinian terror attack has * ever * claimed as many victims as irgun 's king david hotel attack , with 92 dead iirc ; and that is just the most obvious and egregious example . 
  finally , i feel the same way about your own blatantly one-sided portrayals of the conflict in which you conflate lone-wolf stabbing attacks with mass casualty bombings and claim the stabbings are * worse * . 
  do you not feel the greatest incentivisation towards the stabbings is the brutality of the occupation , rather than mere words ? 
  i would at least consider that possibility if i were you !, 
  the difference is that i *** do not *** support terrorism from either side , whereas you shrilly and with entirely hypocritical self-righteousness can not see the parallels between the actions of both israelis and palestinians , but rather view the palestinians as villains attacking the poor , innocent israelis . 
  things just are n't that simple . 
  edit : spelling, 
  wow , those rolls look just like croissants !, 
  the west is `` the west '' as opposed to the east , that primarily being asia . 
  it is a cultural designation more so than a geographical one ; this is why australia and nz are considered western nations , despite being to the east of much of asia . 
  there was , in earlier times going back to antiquity , a split in the known world between europe ( the west ) and asia ( the east ) although due to trade the chinese and romans ( for example ) were aware of each other . 
  africa , on the other hand , was at the time mainly unknown , at least as far as sub-saharan africa goes . 
  the west was thus the west as opposed to the other known cultures and this is terminology that has continued in common parlance to this day . 
  it is a divide that has also been culturally cemented by millennia of conflict that dates back as far as western history with the greco-persian wars . 
  the blades of a helicopter only develop lift by `` pushing down '' on the air at slow-speeds and whilst transitioning from take-off/hover to forward flight . 
  in forward flight the rotor blades actually generate lift in a similar manner to a conventional aircraft 's wings as opposed to `` pushing down '' against the air .
