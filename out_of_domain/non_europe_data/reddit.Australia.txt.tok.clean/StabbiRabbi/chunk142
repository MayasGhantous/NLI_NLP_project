  therefore , if moving fast enough , the blades still generate lift sufficiently for some helicopters to be able to loop-the-loop , although extended inverted flight is not possible . 
  tbh , i think the `` vengeance is mine '' phrase would be entirely appropriate for barbie - i could easily imagine her shouting those exact words as she cut ken 's suits and ties to ribbons for cheating on her with skipper ... 
  what exactly are you referring to when you discuss israeli `` condemnation '' of irgun and the stern gang ? 
  ben-gurion 's `` condemnation '' of these groups were empty words by any measure - the fact is that these groups were absorbed into the idf ( going on to commit the worst of the atrocities in '48 including deir yassin ) and their leadership was quickly adopted as the newly formed israeli state 's leadership with both irgun leader menachem begin and stern gang leader yitzhak shamir subseqently serving as pm !, 
  in what sense does any of that count as condemnation ? 
  when did you `` roundly condemn '' irgun ? 
  even in your latest reply you are making excuses for their attacks , eg claiming the king david hotel bombing was justified somehow because it targeted ( civilian ) government workers . 
  israeli terrorism ended when they formed a state for two reasons : a ) they had achieved their political goals & b ) they now carry out their violence through the machinery of state rather than terrorism , but does that really justify that violence ? 
  israelis as a whole are no more innocent victims than palestinians are . 
  to quote [ wikipedia 's figures from the article on palestinian political violence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_political_violence ) :, 
   it is estimated that since 1920 , when the first riots against jews broke out , ** 90,785 arabs ** including palestinians have died , and some 67,602 been wounded in all wars and conflicts between israel and its neighbors . 
  on the other hand , ** 24,84 jews and israelis ** have died and 35,356 have been wounded during the same period . 
  [ 30 ] since 1967 , some reports estimate that some ** 40 % of the male population of the west bank and gaza ** have been arrested or detained in israeli prisons for political or military reasons . 
  do you * really * believe that , given the above , `` incitement '' is necessary for palestinians to feel angered by their living conditions ? 
  i can unreservedly state both sides should be held accountable for their actions ( as i already have ) , when will you do the same ? 
  that 's a whole lot of hurt for the japanese at the other end of those rockets ' flightpath , the same as an eight round salvo from a 5 '' gun !, 
   they did not . 
  ooh , well argued point . 
  you might try to claim there was no deliberate targeting of civilians by israeli forces ( though i would * love * you to provide solid proof of that - do you have any of the specific orders issued to back the claim up ? 
  ) ; however , one thing that is certain is that civilian casualties , no matter how heavy , * never * led to the idf ceasing the operations that caused those casualties . 
  the solution you describe is essentially the arab peace initiative , an initiative which has been stonewalled by israel since it was first proposed in 2002 - nearly fifteen years ago . 
  how exactly do you get israelis supporting this plan from the reality of what has actually occurred , ie the government steadfastly refusing to accept it ? 
  we can all quote polls - [ remember the one where nearly half of all israelis believe palestinians should be ethnically cleansed from israel , while a full 80 % believe jews in israel deserve preferential treatment just for being jewish ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-want-ethnic-cleansing-palestinians-wake-up-call-survey-finds-a6919271.html ) ? 
  probably a bug ... 
  well then , that seems to be the logical explanation then . 
  test it out - act out a `` play '' designed to push her buttons and see if she reacts ... 
  where are the sheep ? 
  and that girl 's name ? 
  trolly mctrollface . 
  that 's paranoia for you . 
  always scared , or angered , by stuff that is n't even there . 
  yeah , the israeli collective punishment model is well established ( at least so far as the families of palestinian terrorists go ) so you have to imagine this is what they would expect australia to do with such egregious criminals as she too , do n't you ? 
  this is a matter of national shame to me as an australian . 
  i have yet to speak to any australian who supports israel 's behaviour in occupied palestine , so why do n't out politicians reflect that and condemn settlement expansion and etc in the same way that even the us government does , let alone the eu and its member nations ? 
  my personal belief is that australia should recognise palestine and join with our other , natural , allies in condemning the occupation . 
  such a motion was tabled in 2014 , but reprehensibly failed to pass . 
  given the facts you just stated it seems pretty clear why . 
  drop bears . 
  the link did n't work for me so idk if this is mentioned , but clark 's entry into rome was a serious strategic error as it allowed the majority of german forces , who had left rome as an open city , to escape to new defensive positions further up the italian peninsula . 
  clark 's orders were actually to pursue and destroy the retreating germans , but instead he chose to claim the glory of taking rome . 
  had he not done so it is quite conceivable that the italian campaign could have been ended much earlier . 
  or it was abandoned as the allies swept through ? 
  that 's a great set of photos , thank you for sharing . 
  gen y and millennial are exactly the same generation , there just happens to be two names for it . 
  it baffles me that such extensions are allowed by google - in this case the entire function of the extension is literally bigotry , so what possible justification is there for allowing it ? 
  free speech is one thing , but imo this scarcely counts as a free speech type issue . 
  it 's * sole * purpose is to reinforce people 's prejudices and further aggravate the already lurid imaginations of people who subscribe to the worst kind of anti-semitic bullshit even without anything like this to make them foam at the mouth even more . 
  does having a moat make an island ? 
  in any case i for one would love to have a moat surrounding my home . 
  unfortunately i live in a flat ... 
  who started it ? 
  if the zionists had not picked palestine as their `` homeland '' there would be no conflict . 
  period . 
  i did read your comments and your condemnation of irgun was qualified , at best , if only for your apologia for the kdh bombing alone . 
  if my initial comment was `` justifying '' terrorism , then your excuses surrounding the king david hotel bombing are positively apologia ( as well as being manipulatively inaccurate - eg it was only a `` valid military target '' in the eyes of the most egregious of zionist terrorism apologists ; the warnings were only provided to the hotel switchboard , not the authorities and did not reach the authorities , as was recently acknowledged by the israeli authorities after * they installed a plaque making the same false claims as you which they subsequently altered after being called out in it by britain * ) . 
  hold yourself to the same standard as you hold others , please - which incidentally , at a macro pro-israeli commenter level , was the point of what i wrote that you chose to read as a justification for terrorism . 
  as for ben-gurion 's words i have already detailed how his actions tell an entirely different story . 
  your indignation at my putting words in your mouth is laughable . 
  this is perfectly illustrated by your final `` point '' - i did not say it needs to be a prerequisite for the cessation of violence today , but rather simply pointed out the innate hypocrisy of israel criticising the palestinians for behaving exactly as israel did when the zionists were in the same political position as the palestinians are today . 
  edit : removed unnecessary emphasis, 
  no exactly analogous given microsoft does n't then deliberately publish and distribute such malware via their own channels , but i get your point . 
  however , whether or not google want to have to curate every plugin or not , they could at least remove those people complain about as has happened in this instance ... 
  the female of the species is often more deadly than the male . 
  [ not designed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hugo_boss_ ( fashion_designer \\ ) #support _ of_nazism ) - that 's a myth . 
  they were * manufactured * by boss though . 
   why does this not work here ? 
  are they above any international law ? 
  consider the israeli courts ' opinions regarding the west bank settlements vs geneva convention iv ( to which they are signatory ) , specifically the sections related to colonisation of occupied territory for an answer to your question . 
  freemen of the land is the correct term in commonwealth countries i believe . 
  as i understand it - albeit as a non-freeman personally - the sovereign citizen nomenclature is in opposition to being a federal citizen in the usa , something that does n't really make sense in commonwealth nations ( even australia due to differences in our federal system ) , but yes , they are all essentially the same thing . 
  * company commander * by charles b. mcdonald is an absolute classic in terms of wwii memoirs . 
  it describes the author 's experiences as a rifle company commander in serving with the us army 's 2nd infantry division in the eto post-d-day ( from just before the battle of the bulge to the final victory over germany ) . 
  it 's an excellent book and very readable . 
  it was first published in 1947 and has been in print continuously ever since afaik , now also available on kindle if that 's your thing . 
  max hastings 's books are also very good if you are interested in a history of the war . 
  i love his little wink , lol . 
  rare roast beef with horseradish is a brilliant sandwich . 
  it 's * not * an occupation ? 
  i thought * everyone * at least agreed that it is , in fact , an occupation and furthermore that the occupation per se is legal . 
  right of conquest is no longer a valid legal concept since post-wwii treaties superseded the treaty of westphalia from which right of conquest 's legality was derived . 
  let me guess - you vote for the jewish home ~ ~ gang ~ ~ party , right ? 
  despite my personal discomfort with certain aspects of israeli policy , almost exclusively pertaining to the illegal colonisation of the occupied west bank , i sincerely hope the bds movement in its current form fails spectacularly ; and spectacularly enough for its proponents to just give up and stfu . 
  the movement does n't seek to end the occupation , or progress towards a palestinian state within a two-state framework , but rather explicitly calls for israel 's destruction . 
  that is a goal i simply can not support and calling for completely delegitimises the boycott movement imo . 
  all it achieves is fragmentation of the pro-palestinian/peace lobby whilst further ( and perfectly reasonably so ) aggravating all supporters of israel ( myself included !, 
  and could you provide a link to this recipe ? 
  that looks like an amazing paella !, 
  would look funny with a big hairy bush sprouting out of her panties ' vent things . 
  i like this one because it 's not some trumpist troll , he really had no idea . 
  his little ` murica rant was genuine , good ol' timey american ignorance . 
  by the end of the thread he 's all like `` i did n't know '' after some other americans told him they were taught about it at school . 
  i would hope before there was a civil war that western countries like the usa , uk , france , germany , australia , canada and so on would intervene to control the inevitable israeli excesses . 
  yes , israelis do seem to have a certain penchant for both inflicting and provoking violence much as you describe , but the restraining influence of a multinational task force would surely protect the palestinians ? 
  why would * any * of that happen ? 
  it all sounds a bit histrionic tbh . 
  i do n't think the un has been * proven * to be anti-israeli as such either ; that belief being held solely by right-wing israelis afaik . 
  i do understand your reservations about this plan and you have explained realistic potential problems , in your first comment at least , which have certainly made me realise the plan is pretty much infeasible ; however , i do think it 's interesting to consider and discuss alternatives to the seemingly perennially stalled ( due to faults on both sides , with neither solely to blame ) efforts to achieve a two-state solution . 
  if nothing else talking about concepts such as a confederation , or a single-state solution , serves to keep dialogue open while demonstrating that the path to peace and stability must surely lie in the success of the two-state solution . 
  which bit do you think is funniest ? 
  the bit where i agree with your conclusions is good , but i suppose it 's the notion that israel 's right-wing extremists actually are interested in even discussing peace that really raises a chuckle ?
