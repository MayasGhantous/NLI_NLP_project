  yes , the story has been reported on for a couple of years now since they first found remains of these people . 
  since then debate has raged about whether or not the remains were of a different hominid species , or genetically/disease growth-limited modern humans . 
  this latest discovery seems to demonstrate that the `` hobbits '' are in fact a specialised evolutionary path taken by early hominids who moved to the island while it was still connected to the mainland , but evolved to become progressively smaller to survive in the limited resource environment of a small island . 
  he literally says :, 
   ** any person ** be he jewish , christian or buddhist will have the right to apply for palestinian citizenship, 
  it follows that anyone with palestinian citizenship is ... ( wait for it ... ), 
  allowed . 
  live in . 
  if the settlers wish to stay then they simply need to apply for palestinian citizenship . 
  of course it may not be possible , depending on the rules , to possess both israeli and palestinian citizenship concurrently . 
  in that case the settlers would have choose what they wanted more - citizenship , or to live in palestine . 
  not ethnic cleansing . 
   indigenous minority group, 
  as opposed to the indigenous * majority * group said minority group is desperate to complete expelling from the land . 
  why is settlers in inverted commas ? 
  that means he was black , right ? 
  only in palestine is there currently an aggressive colonial project where the indigenous population are denied the basic rights of citizenship , forced out their homes , subject to humiliating and oppressive laws based on their ethnicity and regularly suffering violence from the hands of these invasive , hate-filled and openly bigoted , foreign settlers ... 
  horses for courses mate . 
  that took me waaaay too long . 
  i was all like `` i do n't get it , that orange cat does n't look like lasagna ... 
  ohhhh . '', 
  hey !, 
  you knows facts just highlight america 's faults ... 
  sharks find their prey by sensing minute electrical currents caused by other animals ' movements in the water . 
  electricians , of course , carry a residual charge constantly in their bodies ( from which they gain the tolerance to electricity that always them to safely work with electricity without getting electrocuted as you or i would ) . 
  that charge carries in the water , and may well be what attracted the shark or caused it to breach like that . 
  in australia , we all know not to go in the ocean at the same time as a sparky ( aussie slang for an electrician ) ; it 's similar to not taking a toaster into the bath with you . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ ** all ** ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ up . 
  ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ take ^ ^ ^ toasters ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bath ^ ^ ^ though . 
  ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ real , ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ entirely ^ ^ ^ unrelated ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ sharks . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ electricians . 
  oh man , they sure are . 
  i was staying at fox , near the glacier on that south island , at easter and we went to a restaurant a bit out of town , near a nature reserve at a lake . 
  coming out it was absolutely pitch black outside - it made it hard to find the car , but damn those stars !, 
  i have never seen them so clearly before in my life . 
  this is a great photo , well done man . 
  so the israeli propaganda machine would have you believe , but do n't let them suck you in , consider the * evidence * . 
  for a start , the name palestine predates the historical kingdom of israel ( 1000bc-730bc ) , as is evident when we examine the * [ etymology ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palestine#etymology ) * :, 
   from latin palaest\u012bna ( `` roman province of palestine '' ) , from ancient greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 ( palaist\u00edn\u0113 , `` philistia and the surrounding region '' ) , from hebrew \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea ( p ` l\u00e9shet , `` philistia , land of the philistines '' ) , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] from the root \u05e4 \u05be \u05dc \u05be \u05e9 ( p-l-\u0161 , `` migrate , invade '' ) . 
  [ 3 ] the term p-l-s-t or p-r-s-t , found in five ancient egyptian inscriptions ( beginning with one at medinet habu from circa 1170 bce and ending with padiiset 's statue inscription from circa 900-850 bce ) as the name of a people near egypt , is traditionally taken to be cognate . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] seven assyrian inscriptions contain the word `` palas ( h ) tu '' or `` pilistu '' , which is usually also taken to be cognate . 
  next , let 's consider the * [ genetic evidence ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinians#dna_and_genetic_studies ) * :, 
   in recent years , many genetic studies have demonstrated that , at least paternally , most of the various jewish ethnic divisions and the palestinians -- and other levantines -- are genetically closer to each other than the jews to their host countries . 
  i know that 's a bit complicated and technical , but what it means are jews and palestinians descend from the same ancestors . 
  in other words , both populations have roots in the region and therefore arrived at the same time . 
  however , most of the jews left and did n't even bother trying to return for 2,000 years , thus abrogating their connection with the land and becoming - in every sense other than some kind of mystical mumbo-jumbo - foreigners ( except those who decided to stay of course ) . 
  the words in italics are the ones you might want to google to find out more about what they mean , together with the links i provided . 
  uh-huh . 
  and does this `` fact '' have any * proof * , or is it just what you read in the torah ? 
  this new find demonstrates that they species was living on the island for hundreds of thousands of years , proving the more recent specimens found were not modern humans deformed either congenitally , by malnutrition or by disease . 
  i ca n't believe i missed that ... 
  there are two definitions for billion in ( uk ) english - the traditional value being a million million , but most people now accepting/using the us thousand million . 
  the same goes for trillion . 
  well , not * always * - there * were * pre-jewish populations - but i did explain that the jews ' and palestinians ' ancestors ( being as they were the same group ) arrived at the same time , and that a small population of jews had always decided to stay . 
  tbh , i do n't really get what you 're disagreeing with . 
  well , there is , of course , a difference between cultural arabs and , for want of a better term , * arab * arabs , ie saudis and etc from the arabian peninsula . 
  i know it 's a popular refrain in israeli propaganda that all arabs are the same and they have 22 countries to live in and the jews just want one and the arabs can go to any country and rabble , rabble , rabble ; however , that patently is n't true . 
  for example , an algerian and a yemeni share very little in common other than language and religion - food , clothing and all other cultural elements differ greatly , as does physical appearance . 
  genetic studies on palestinians themselves have revealed they have distinctly levantine genetics - in fact , the closest population genetically are the jews , even ashkenazim with their healthy admixture of european genes . 
  so the first part of your claim is wrong . 
  the second part is correct though . 
  and , for you , one out two ai n't bad so i can only suggest that you keep trying and working on improving your knowledge until who knows ... 
  maybe one day you will be able to manage an entire comment that is entirely factual ? 
  ok , but as you are clearly already full-bottle on this topic , perhaps you could share some specific examples ? 
  they can spend all the money they like , but it does n't necessarily do them a proportional amount of good ; or is bad perhaps the operative word ? 
  i agree their gaining any influence within our media is ipso facto bad , but tbh it 's not that concerning to me that they include a centre lift-out in the smh ; that is such a blunt instrument that most , if not all , australians would take it with a hefty grain of salt , if they even read it at all . 
  ( i , for one , would throw that straight in the recycling . ), 
  what 's much more worrying is that they might be able to influence editorial decisions , a much more subtle way of manipulating the press . 
  australian media has traditionally valued its editorial independence greatly , but who 's to say that wo n't be eroded in these cash-strapped times for traditional news media ? 
  subtly changing perceptions with spin , or easier still , omissions is much harder to detect - even for people cognisant and even suspicious of chinese media 's financial influence . 
  at the moment china does n't * seem * to `` do '' subtle particularly well , but they will evolve . 
  for an example of this process in action , if you 're interested , check out rt 's streaming video news channels . 
  they are * almost * indistinguishable from the channels like cnn and the bbc which they ape ( there are specific channels targeting each ) , down to the slick production values and perfect accents of the presenters . 
  it 's only when a jarring `` nato is evil '' or paean to putin comes out of their mouths that you realise you 're actually watching foreign propaganda . 
  it 's actually quite amusing , albeit in a discomfiting way , and surprisingly mesmeric viewing ; a long way from the old style , heavy-handed didacticism we associate with russian ( soviet ) propaganda . 
  if china can achieve that same self-aware lightness of touch , but promulgated through our own media channels then this could be a very real problem for our society . 
  that does n't actually explain why they do n't * all * come in boxes though , does it ? 
  or why the ones that crumble are only bagged while the ones with greater inherent structural integrity are the ones in boxes for that matter ? 
  the all box thing can probably be attributed to cost and overall space , but why are they each packaged in what would seem on the face of it to be the illogical order they are ? 
  that is the * real * question we need the answer to here . 
  oh , ok . well then , i do n't know that there 's much i can do about that , sorry . 
  i do appreciate your honesty though . 
  just google * chimichurri * - you will get many more results than you would have for chumichurri . 
  without having read the link ( as is reddit protocol ) i can answer this just from the url . 
  the number of the beast is thought to originally have been a codified reference to nero in early christian writings , due to his persecution of christians . 
  the link is for the wikipedia article on the number of the beast , albeit specifically about how reagan used satanic rituals to gain power and then covered his traces . 
  ( ok , i made * that * bit up , but the thing about nero is 100 % for real ... ), 
  sweet scam - bullets are like , a few cents , right , but any kind of opiate is going to run into the few dollar range at least ( or so i would imagine , i do n't actually know the cost of narcotics in us cities . 
  er , or australian cities for that matter ... ) . 
  like a tumour ? 
  there has always been a * country * called palestine , with the name predating the kingdom of israel in the archaeological record by a couple of centuries . 
  there was never a * modern nation state * called palestine , which was directly due to the zionists ' interference in the process of such a state 's formation post-mandate as had always been intended . 
  you have conflated the two concepts in what must unfortunately be considered a deliberate effort to muddy the waters . 
  i know you know that palestine predates israel as the region 's name because i have provided you with these facts , including references , previously . 
  equally , i know that you will simply downvote this comment and refuse to allow little things like the * facts * to permeate your narrative ; however , i never comment for your elucidation , but rather for that of others who actually consider facts relevant . 
  for those who are interested in the facts , here is the [ etymology of palestine ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palestine#etymology ) ( including a reference to its first * proven * usage being known to date to 1170 bc - ie 170 years * before * the kingdom of israel , which existed between 1000-730 bc ) :, 
   from latin palaest\u012bna ( `` roman province of palestine '' ) , from ancient greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 ( palaist\u00edn\u0113 , `` philistia and the surrounding region '' ) , from hebrew \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea ( p ` l\u00e9shet , `` philistia , land of the philistines '' ) , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] from the root \u05e4 \u05be \u05dc \u05be \u05e9 ( p-l-\u0161 , `` migrate , invade '' ) . 
  [ 3 ] the term p-l-s-t or p-r-s-t , found in five ancient egyptian inscriptions ( beginning with one at medinet habu from circa 1170 bce and ending with padiiset 's statue inscription from circa 900-850 bce ) as the name of a people near egypt , is traditionally taken to be cognate . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] seven assyrian inscriptions contain the word `` palas ( h ) tu '' or `` pilistu '' , which is usually also taken to be cognate . 
  furthermore , the jewish home hold * three * senior cabinet positions - nearly half their total numbers in the knesset .
