  i was not trying to excuse or claim that our history is somehow rendered acceptable by the greater horrors the zionist colonial project has inflicted upon the native people of palestine, 
  indeed , i have clearly acknowledged the tragedy of australia 's colonisation and made no excuses for it whatsoever . 
  as the yishuv at the time the mandate began was very much an insignificant minority , the decision of who may stay and who must return to the home of their ( verifiable , non-ancient , actual rather than `` spiritual '' ) ancestors ' homelands must fall mainly on the traditional owners ' shoulders , that is the palestinian people . 
  of course the original jews should get a vote , but only proportional to the mandate 's proportional demographics . 
  incidentally , have you surveyed australia 's aboriginals to canvass their views ? 
  by what authority do you speak for them ? 
  i have noticed that they are one of your favourite subjects to comment on ( i briefly glanced at your illuminating comment history ) , what is the source of this interest ? 
  have you many australian aboriginal friends or family perhaps ? 
  anyway , this has been fun , but it 's getting a bit tedious . 
  good talk , see you in the threads no doubt . 
  yeah , that was my first thought . 
  it really does look great . 
   well , that and it 's a ~ ~ spectacular ~ ~ * fabulous * time ... 
  i hope he does get jail , i thought it was a travesty when he basically escaped punishment the first time round and was happy to hear of the appeal 's success ( the backstory to that was fascinatingly explained in this sub by a south african lawyer , who will hopefully return itt though i forget his username to try summoning , but basically the second court found that the first had interpreted the law incorrectly - it was all quite different from other commonwealth or us process ) . 
  at the point i read the stream it had just emerged that , despite his doctor claiming he was too unwell to face the trial he had been perfectly capable of coping with an international press interview the night before - which , amusingly , was news to his doctor . 
  it did n't make him sound great and i hope he keeps shooting himself in the foot , metaphorically of course , till he has undermined his bid for pity completely . 
  he murdered that woman and deserves the appropriate punishment . 
  yeah , that was the one . 
  good find . 
  u/zebulon gave a fantastic explanation . 
  except in a normal , british-derived court system ( eg uk , australia , nz ) that move where he was retried on appeal because the original judge was wrong in law would n't be possible afaik , any more than it would in america . 
  double-jeopardy would protect you from a retrial because the judge had misunderstood the law in both commonwealth ( ie former british colonies with a british-based system ) and the us i believe , though ianal and my understanding may be off of course . 
  ah , ok - does us law not use latin ? 
  you * can * have leftist ultra-nationalists too , you know ? 
  no imperial powers perhaps , but colonialism is alive and well in the palestinian occupied territories ... 
  says the valiant `` furiouslyfeminist '' in her fight against ignorance and chauvinism in ~ ~ all ~ ~ , well some , of its forms !, 
  scenery , of course , is a big drawcard , especially in the south island and there are lots of things to both see and do . 
  the people are friendly , albeit difficult to understand when they talk ( jk kiwis - i can * usually * figure out what you 're trying to say ! ) . 
  the country is good value ( as an australian tourist at least - ymmv , but probably not by much ) and the standard of accommodation & etc pretty decent . 
  and omg the food there is so good !, 
   * people from other countries * *** think ***, 
  i do n't think you 're from another country and i do n't think you really * thought * about that opinion either , did you ? 
  it is , after all , the standard us jingoism we all know and love from american patriots . 
  still , thank you for your service ( and our free healthcare , lol ) o7, 
  my old rottie used to love mulberries - whenever they were in season the first thing she 'd do every morning was go to the back of the garden and hoover up every berry that had fallen onto the ground the night before !, 
  i love the irony of ~ ~ his ~ ~ * this particular openly extremist settler * claiming that `` israel knows all about international law '' and that * he 's * looking forward to sharing ~ ~ that ~ ~ * his * knowledge with other countries ; technically that may be true , but do we * really * need the world 's rogue states being given lessons on ignoring and flouting , rather than acceding to , international conventions * by someone who is as unapologetically extremist as he * ? 
  * israel gaining a position leading a un body is , however , a positive development in and of itself , given the role the un has to play in resolving the conflict and the present levels of mistrust for the un among israelis , who - with real justification in some cases - fear the un is biased against their nation . 
  edited as per u/anon4532654 's comment below - the old text is struck through and changes in italics for emphasis . 
   palestine was basically it 's own entity that ran autonomously, 
  so you admit there * was * a de facto palestinian state , the very thing pro-israeli propaganda simply will not countenance whatsoever ? 
  ze'ev jabotinsky , irgun leader and zionist ( terrorist ) hero , was actually personal friends with mussolini and wanted to base israel on il duce 's fascist italy , something many israelis conveniently choose to ignore . 
  it looks like * his * vision for israel is drawing ever closer , what 's more . 
  i did n't mean to imply israel was itself a rogue state and i think it 's a great positive that israel has gained a position within the un , as ultimately i think the un has a significant part to play in resolving this conflict , but also that achieving that will probably require greater trust in the un from israelis . 
  ( whose objections to the un are very well known and are with regards to some of the issues are quite understandable . ), 
  however , i do n't know if this guy , with his settler associations and background , is necessarily the best individual to be teaching lessons on international law . 
  i guess i should have emphasised the ** his ** part so it was perfectly clear i was referring to him and not israel per se . 
  netanyahu to world :, 
   totes open for peace . 
  arab initiative is definitely on the table as far as we 're concerned . 
  netanyahu to right-wing extremist support base :, 
   nah , it 's cool guys . 
  no peace on my watch , screw the arab initiative lol, 
  netanyahu could n't even lie straight in bed if he tried . 
  what amazes me is that he thinks the world does n't notice as he snickers and giggles at the international community after each time he claims to be `` open to peace negotions , anytime '' . 
  just nitpicking ( i agree with all you 're saying ) , but iran does n't actually have nukes , so could n't start a * nuclear * war ; that does n't change the fact that they would be * very * stupid to engage in warfare with an enemy who would though ... 
  ok , i just reread it and can see your point , i 'll edit it to make my point clearer ( while acknowledging why so i do n't orphan your comment !, 
  i 'm glad you brought it up and am happy to have edited my op to make my thoughts clearer - much better , but sadly uncommon , to talk about things rather than kneejerk assume the worst and i am glad you did so in this case . 
  yeah mig-25s were designed to intercept the mach 3 sr-71 blackbird recon plan and xb-70 valkyrie bomber ( which as the ` x ' in its designation indicates never actually entered service ) so it * could * reach speeds exceeding mach 3 for short periods ; however , the engines were not able to handle being run at that power level for extended periods and would be trashed by being pushed that hard . 
  iirc correctly ( as is the reddit way i have n't actually read the linked article tbh ) this incident was the result of the mig-25 's efforts to escape israeli interceptors - successfully , albeit at the cost of destroying the aircraft 's engines . 
  also interesting is the fear the mig-25 generated when it was first observed by the west before its limitations were known - it was one of the spurs for development of the f-15 , an aircraft that may not have been as potentially fast , but is a far superior fighter in every way . 
  the mig-25s flaws were only discovered when a soviet pilot defected to japan in his mig-25 , which was immediately pulled apart and thoroughly examined by the japanese before the aircraft was returned to the russians at their vociferous insistence . 
  after that the aircraft ceased to be such a feared boogeyman to western observers !, 
  plitvice is absolutely stunning , and well worth taking a day to explore . 
  the whole park is full of waterfalls like this as well as beautiful streams and lakes . 
  this picture captures what it 's like very nicely . 
  hence the headless horseman being a hessian soldier , in the sleepy hollow story at least ... 
  later , in the same thread , from the same genius :, 
   if winning the science victory is meaningless ( ai , space travel , metamaterials , future weapons , exoskeletons , life extension , gene manipulation , elimination of diseases , etc ) than why is it in civ v ? 
  i think we can all agree this argument settles the matter once and for all . 
  quite obviously the primary deliminator of what matters and what does n't is a video game . 
  and do you want to know where that video game was produced ? 
  america motherfuckers ... 
  robert harris is an excellent author generally : i think i have read all his books , and have definitely enjoyed all i have read very much . 
  looks like there 's at least a few good drags left in it too - bonus !, 
  the fights between rival football club 's `` firms '' ( hooligan gangs ) have been organised for years , in the uk at least . 
  this was partly so they could arrange somewhere to fight where the police would not be ready and waiting to break it up . 
  the leaders would be in touch with each other , something the internet and mobile phones has only made easier . 
  ah yes , the era of `` freedom fries '' - when french fries were too goddam unpatriotic to be served to the free . 
  fourteen cops with guns showed up and it still went on for a long time after that too . 
  obviously just having more guns around * does n't * just fix the situation . 
  enigma * is * good . 
  there 's one about stalin 's son which is fun . 
  the books he wrote about rome - a trilogy about cicero and one about pompeii - are all very historically accurate as well as telling a good story . 
  the others are all well worth reading too ; as i said , i do n't think there 's one i did n't enjoy . 
  now all the usa needs is some stronger human rights laws and they 'll be all caught up ... 
  but here 's my number ... 
  `` shake it off '' by t-swizzle . 
   trafficking a large commercial quantity of illicit drugs, 
  slight understatement ... 
  if they had only had weed llama instead of jar-jar perhaps episode i would n't have sucked quite so hard ... 
  from the looks of weed llama the force runs strong through him . 
  and of course the more diversity there is , the more guns you * need * to feel safe ... 
  that 's why so many americans are so heavily armed , they need to be just to cope with all that diversity surrounding them . 
  to [ eat it ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2012/07/the_666_gold_wrapped_douche_burger_is_it_safe_to_eat_gold_.html ) . 
  i read that they have been successfully employing teams of apaches that also control drones for recon in iraq , i think that might be their primary role in theatre . 
  [ timur ( tamerlane ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timur ) was known for the towers of skulls he would build outside cities that resisted his offers to include them in his empire . 
  it is estimated his campaigns caused the deaths of 17m people , or 5 % of the world 's population at the time and his empire stretched from mesopotamia through to china . 
  [ * blue murder * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_murder_ ( miniseries \\ ) ) was a great aussie tv show that goes into the life and crimes of roger the dodger and his erstwhile partner in crime , arthur `` neddy '' smith , for those who are interested . 
  neddy 's book , * neddy * , is also a good read about nsw 's '80s cops and robbers . 
  it also helps make sense of the apache in the kiowa 's old cavalry recon role , and is a great example of modern force multipliers .
