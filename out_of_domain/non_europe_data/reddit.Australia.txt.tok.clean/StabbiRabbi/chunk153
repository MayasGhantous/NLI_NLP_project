  i must admit i thought it sounded sarky , but with your explanation i see it can easily be read the other day . 
  i did n't downvote you before anyway , but have my upvotes now - i too like the way `` whinge '' works . 
  i think aussie vernacular is great . 
  username * does n't * check out . 
  you may call * me * sahib . 
  yes , it was a very high risk operation , and one that failed . 
  they did literally drive through the enemy lines , with the british armoured corp involved barrelling up the highway , trying to reach the paratroopers ( who had been dropped to capture and hold the bridges until the ground forces ' arrival ) in time , before the germans overwhelmed the lightly equipped paratroopers . 
  it worked in eindhoven and nijmegen , but ultimately there were too many delays and never reached arnhem . 
  u/heckler32 discusses some of these issues in a sibling comment to yours . 
  share did i say all gun owners are gun nuts , i said the ones who were whiny little bitches were . 
  you notice it from most of the gun nuts who comment on reddit too . 
  jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams either , right mate ? 
  i have n't lived in britain for many years , but afaik these groups run the full gamut from holding seats in parliament to being street thugs , but with a lot of connexions between the different groups on a variety of levels . 
  for example there is ukip which is the uk independence party and are nationalists , as the name indicates , who hold seats in parliament , but do not have an overtly racist agenda as much as a xenophobic agenda . 
  most ukip supporters are not extremists ; however , some ukip ~ ~ members ~ ~ * supporters * do have roots in groups like the national front or the british nationalist party ( bnp ) , who most definitely do ( did ? ), 
  have an extremist/racist agenda , including connexions with `` direct action '' elements , ie street thugs ( eg combat 18 , who in turn are linked with blood and honour and are internationally organised extreme right wing thugs ) . 
  there are also other extremist parties and groups out there , including the britain first party - mentioned as this attacker 's group affiliation - who derived from the bnp . 
  someone else can probably explain it better , but that 's the gist . 
  edit : clarified the bit about how * some * ukip supporters have backgrounds/histories of association with the extremist parties to make it clear that ukip is itself not an extremist party and highlight that they have a xenophobic , rather than racist , agenda . 
  ahem , the vacuum * monster * i think you mean !, 
  another clear example is government organised astroturfers with multiple sock puppet alts from countries like russia , china and israel block voting in threads relating to those countries . 
  some of these are actually paid shills , whilst others are unofficial groups pushing the same agenda . 
  ( eg israel has [ paid shills organised by the government ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html ) , the [ jidf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_internet_defense_force ) who organise themselves in addition to the paid government shills and individuals `` making [ hasbara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_diplomacy_ ( israel \\ ) ) '' all contributing to their effort . ), 
  these users attempt to bury new posts with a flurry of downvote when they are first posted , then dominate the comment threads both with the volume of propaganda shitposts they `` contribute '' and the same downvoting tactics as are applied at the post level . 
  of course israel is not unique in this regard and a percentage of pro-israeli posts are nothing to do with brigading , shilling or astroturfing ; i am just using them as an example because i can provide references to the specific groups involved on israel 's behalf . 
  no , the other groups are n't as directly tied to brexit as ukip are ( afaik - remember i now live in australia and only visit the uk once every year or two ) and long pre-dated the whole brexit debacle . 
  they have a much more `` traditional '' extreme right agenda . 
  it looks to me like a disused cornish tin mining building , from cornwall in england 's south-west ; i may be wrong about that specifically , but i would be very confident saying that it was built for an industrial purpose of some kind : note the water runs and chimney . 
  `` tad bit '' is a tad tautologous . 
  so she just has natural `` resting duck face '' ? 
  must an awful condition to have to live with op , my condolences to you both . 
  puppy is paws down cuter , btw . 
  oh fuck yes . 
  the pepsi will have not only survived , but also matured in its can - much like a fine wine . 
  i concur , the tpp worries me , especially the fact we * do n't * know all of its details and implications . 
  i understand the value of ftas and trading blocs completely and am in favour of them in principle , but am concerned by how they increasingly seem to favour corporations over both national and individual rights . 
  some pretty significant events right there - i would consider framing and hanging those op . 
  the supply of drinking water to parts of the occupied west bank in palestine from israel was heavily restricted recently until after the issue was publicised ; even palestinians have access to the internet though . 
  eh es\u00e9 , you want some burritos ? 
  unions using rats to announce themselves is very apt imo . 
  that 's much as i thought - the ukip connexion so referred to were more former bnp/nf supporters now supporting ukip , rather than actually organisational links , but it 's good you clarified the situation . 
  obviously whilst ukip do have some unpleasant facets to their policies and some unsavoury supporters they are streets apart from the bnp . 
  at least store them carefully for now , then you will be able to mount or frame them later on if now it is a bit more than you want to spend . 
  ah cool . 
  i thought it could well be a well because of the water runs ( clearly it was never a windmill down there in that valley ! ), 
  which * does n't * match the cornish tin mine buildings , but the shape is * so * similar and the surrounding scenery could be cornwall too . 
  [ here 's the google image link ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=cornish+tin+mine+pictures&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjuloekha7nahxg36ykhsx0b0oq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1758&amp;bih=926 ) for cornish tin mines - you can see they have the same tall , straight sided buildings with a chimney ... 
  i imagine they probably date from around the same era and stage of industrial development . 
  the clear difference is the siting of this mill in the valley , whereas the tin mines tend to be higher up ( though i have seen some similarly nestled into the landscape ) . 
  anyway , thanks for the clarification . 
  australian politics has suffered a similar blurring of the lines as to which of our two major parties their traditional voter bases should support , as both are now essentially centre-right parties that differ more on rhetoric than actual ideology in the same dynamic as you touch on above . . 
  that of course pushes ideologically driven voters to fringe parties who better represent the `` traditional '' values of labor/liberals ( in australia - conservatives/labour in the uk ) , but can also be extremists in some or even most of their policies ... 
  in australia we do n't have an overweening , highly polarising , issue such as brexit to further stimulate this dynamic though which spares us the real loonies coming oiut of the woodwork quite as vociferously as appears to be the case in the uk , luckily for us , but it 's still a bloody nightmare trying to decide for whom to vote . 
  the unions will play an important part in that , with their shady backroom deals and corruption in company with their `` bosses '' bedmates ... 
  with subheader - `` labor promises * $ xxxm * to * fix topic under discussion * '' of course ... 
  oh yes , * poldark * is a good show . 
  the mines are beautiful , are n't they ? 
  they have a very utilitarian aesthetic which bestows a certain elegance imo , and of course the locations are amazing . 
  i have seen a show about a mine that somebody at great cost and massive personal effort restored and converted into a beautiful home ; it was something else , absolutely jaw-dropping !, 
  handy for hanging off a keychain or something with that hole so perfectly positioned . 
  bingo - portable cheese right there in your pocket !, 
  or gun crime for that matter , though at least this guy had an aged revolver ( perhaps an old webley service revolver from wwii ? ), 
  instead of an ar-15 with a hundred round drum magazine loaded with api rounds . 
  ( as per the la robbery where the two guys with ak-47s and full body armour shot it out with the lapd for hours until the police requisitioned some serious firepower from local gun shops ... ), 
  reminds me conceptually of that aussie classic , the [ halal snack pack ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=halal+snack+pack&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1758&amp;bih=926&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_sabrkq7nahvbozqkhcvxahyq_auibigb ) as served by kebab shops , and made up of kebab meat over chips ( fries ) with sauces on top . 
  of course the specific spices and flavours are different , but the basic brilliance of the concept is pretty similar . 
   the guns need to be in the actual scene and in the hands of people who are very , very good in their use . 
  like the trained security guard who was inside you mean ? 
  it depends on the cost of the backup really . 
  oh portable , or pocket ( to use the technical term ) , cheese is * totes * a thing . 
  of course it 's * mainly * the hard cheeses , but right now i actually have a beautiful lump of persian feta in my pocket even as i type this !, 
  do you really think he was trying to make a funny deliberately ? 
  i mean , he succeeded if he was , but i actually took it as a serious comment . 
  he is right though - bigotry toward guns ( especially `` black rifles '' like the ar-15 ! ), 
  is totes not cool in this day and age . 
  oh come off it mate , that 's just pure whataboutery ; i do n't deny it , but `` what about them - they 're big meanies too ! '', 
  is n't the best argument to make . 
  the union movement did a lot of good for us all and is still valuable , but * some * unions * have * screwed their membership over severely and some union officials are no better than thugs . 
  that said , as an undecided voter ( this time round ) i would support a federal icac 100 % ** and ** a royal commission into the banks . 
  i feel the banks have screwed us all over with deliberate malice aforethought and need to be brought to heel sharpish !, 
  i also feel great disquietude at multinationals corporate tax evasion and the benefits they will gain from the tpp which discomfits me greatly in and of itself . 
  despite having voted libs previously ( as well as greens ) , i am not impressed with their present political positions or direction , any more than i am with labor . 
  ( though if i only had two choices today and had to vote i would , i think , vote alp for the first time in my life ... ), 
  although i have serious doubts about the greens ' competency for leadership and no illusions that they will get to govern ( and knowing their preferences will go to labor ) i think i will be voting greens for lower house - a preference i literally developed only today after reading about their push for oversight of the tpp . 
  a vote for the greens also serves to register dissatisfaction with the libs and alp , something i want my vote to do . 
  one may be equally dissatisfied and disappointed in both sides you know . 
  this election offers us no good choices imo , an opinion i have shared here before . 
  the quran was certainly what sprang to mind when he mentioned a book of peace , but are they * that * self-aware ? 
  tbh i did n't check his comment history - i just saw his `` do n't be bigoted to muh ar-15 '' and thought it was priceless . 
  i hope he was being funny tbh , if he was n't this is the most extreme example of pc gone mad i have seen . 
  the thing is though the sentiment of his comment has been popping up in so many threads where they defend the ar-15 as `` nor military '' and a perfectly reasonable weapon to keep around the home ... 
  edit : so i went and checked , and his history is littered with similar sentiments and discussions based around what he 's learned from r/conspiracy . 
  here 's a sample from the second page in that seems pretty relevant :, 
   the overwhelming majority of gun crime in the us is * inner city gang-on-gang warfare crime committed with illegally obtained guns * . 
  if you excise out those stats , * murder rates in the us are barely different than those of western europe * . 
  many people get the idea the us murder rate represents normal people killing normal people across the country with legal guns . 
  that is false . 
  * it 's gang members killing gang members in a few isolated locations with illegal guns * . 
  the more you know !, 
  [ emphasis my own ],
