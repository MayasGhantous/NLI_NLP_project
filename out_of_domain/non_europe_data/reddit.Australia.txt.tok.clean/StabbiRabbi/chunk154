  how would you describe them ? 
  here 's a few more examples though :, 
  these are all from the mainstream press - i left out the massive host of political blogs and organisations making the same claim ... 
  well , the noun tad means the same as the noun bit , op could have been using the adverb of tad of course ( hence my saying it was a tad tautologous , not just all-out tautologous ) , but it 's certainly a tad unclear and * sounds * tautologous used as it is . 
  here are the definitions of both words ( from googling '' [ word ] definition '' :, 
   ** tad **, 
   adverb, 
   to a small extent ; somewhat . 
   `` mark looked a tad embarrassed '', 
   a small amount of something . 
   `` crumpets sweetened with a tad of honey '', 
   ** bit **, 
   a small piece , part , or quantity of something . 
   `` give the duck a bit of bread '', 
   synonyms : small portion , small piece , piece , portion , segment , section , part ;, 
  that 's true in formal logic ; however , the * common usage * of the word as noun outside formal logic ( as i clearly intended ) is as follows ( please excuse the bombardment with dictionary definitions ) :, 
   the saying of the same thing twice over in different words , generally considered to be a fault of style ( e.g. 
  they arrived one after the other in succession ) . 
   synonyms : repetition , repetitiveness , repetitiousness , reiteration , redundancy , superfluity , periphrasis , iteration , duplication ;, 
   a phrase or expression in which the same thing is said twice in different words . 
  really ? 
  i have * never * heard `` tad bit '' used in my life ; in british or australian english at least it 's most certainly not common parlance , let alone idiomatic . 
  ah ok , i used to live in the south east , then moved to australia - i have honestly never heard it used . 
  apparently it 's used in america too though . 
  it sounded strange to me , hence my comment . 
  i did n't say anything about labor being corrupt though , * just * the unions !, 
  you actually put the those words in my mouth , not me . 
  of course labor has its roots in unionism , but they are not one in the same . 
  it 's scarcely my fault if people infer something i did n't mean from something i did n't even say ... 
  i get that labor/unions are this sub 's sacred cows and of course i was going to get downvotes for daring to raise the spectre of their corruption , but as i hope my reply to makes clear at this point in time i am equally ambivalent about the libs as i am the alp , and furthermore i dislike corrupt bankers quite as much as i dislike corrupt unions . 
  in the same way as the government has politicised the unions ' issues so has the opposition already politicised the banks ' . 
  i was n't trying to get into any of that ; i was just responding to the comment i replied to . 
  what 's this based on ? 
  i was certainly not defending big business or the banks , as i hope my subsequent reply to the unions ' other white knight makes perfectly clear . 
  and what is this `` every time '' you accuse me of ? 
  big business gets criticism ( rightly enough too ) literally every day and i can not remember * ever * previously defending them , let alone doing so by pointing fingers at the union . 
  today for example in this sub i commented that i support the greens ' call for oversight of the ttp and how i disliked the fact it favoured multinational business interests over national or individual interests : scarcely the union bashing , pro-big-business polemic you accuse me of ... 
  the only other union-critical comment i have ever made in this sub ( that i recall ) was in response to some kid whose union had done exactly what i just described and sold him and his colleagues down the river , which he started a thread about . 
  please though , point me to all , or even any , of these what must literally be thousands of comments i must have made for your accusation to hold true , and i will apologise for doubting your word . 
  otherwise feel free to stop confusing me with someone else and hop down off that soapbox . 
  an apology on the way down would be nice too , matey . 
  i bet if you asked the op whose beautiful words of wisdom for the poor , oppressed and abused weapon of choice for mass shootings i shared here he would be more than happy to let you know * exactly * ... 
  that 's pure bigotry , arsehole ; ar-15s have more freedoms than you or i put together , they are american after all !, 
  `` little bit '' sounds right , but `` tad bit '' just does n't ; imo , the `` tad '' renders the `` bit '' superfluous and vice versa . 
  it seems this is a regional usage thing though ... 
  ooh , she 's lovely ... 
  i used to live in berkshire and now live in australia , perth to be exact where we have loads of british ex-pats . 
  literally * never * heard `` tad bit '' , but the consensus seems to be that it 's a regional thing . 
  read . 
  comments . 
  please . 
  i have explicitly stated i support the same federal icac as you , and a rc into banking to boot !, 
  the only other comment i made in this sub today was regarding my approval for the greens calls for oversight of the tpp , when i also stated i dislike the tpp 's favouring of corporations over individual or national rights . 
  sorry i do n't fit in your neat little pigeonhole , but there it is , mate . 
  yeah , i mean i get what you 're saying and agree that if one looks at the words in isolation then certainly it would seem `` tad bit '' should be as comfortable rolling off the tongue as `` little bit '' ; they are all essentially synonymous after all ( albeit imprecisely ) . 
  however , to my ears `` tad bit '' sounds awkward , whereas `` little bit '' does n't . 
  i ca n't explain it any better than that though , it 's just one of those idiomatic things i guess . 
  thank you !, 
  it just sounds horribly awkward , does n't it ? 
  the dictionary ( well , the definition google gave me ) does n't specify this , but thinking about it due to this thread i 've come to the conclusion `` tad '' is actually as a synonym of `` little bit '' rather than just `` little '' and `` tad bit '' * is * tautologous . 
  naked boy comes out saying `` make it rain '' ... 
  if that 's not a fabulous show , well then i do n't know what is !, 
  ooh ooh , he forgot that sweden can only pay for civilised social policies because the us protects europe militarily , and us drug companies fund all the r&d that the dirty swedes mooch off ... 
  is that shrimp etouffee instead of gravy and cheese curds , or are there cheese curds too ? 
  either way it looks far more appetising than any other poutine i have ever seen . 
  yeah , it looks awesome . 
  very jealous , ha ha . 
  i 'm from london ( though born to aussie parents ) , but i live in australia and say i 'm an australian born in the uk . 
  people in australia do n't really say britain as much as naming a specific country within it or saying the uk , at least in my experience . 
  yep , kind of like a hybrid between mad max and the muppets is how i would describe it personally . 
  vf-154 black knights , a great squadron . 
  there may be more advanced fighters now , but nothing comes close to the tomcat 's combination of grace and presence imo . 
  apkws is a massive step change in terms of cas/coin firepower - cheap , accurate , limited blast radius ( good for limiting collateral damage ) , but powerful and able to be carried by pretty much anything that can carry a rocket pod it 's the answer to so many situations . 
  it 's great the system is propagating across so many platforms so fast , and the a-10 is a no-brainer for it . 
  it 's from the british museum , but i saw it in perth , western australia when it toured as part of an exhibition called `` a history of the world in 100 objects '' . 
  the head itself was recovered from an excavation in the middle east of a temple , whose builders had captured the statue and buried the head under their temple steps , presumably for the symbolism of walking on their enemy 's god head . 
  it was , however , that gesture of disdain which ironically preserved the head in its present , excellent condition !, 
  a lot of duty free bottles are 1l and very good value ( compared to equivalent prices in australia at least ) ; some of these are standard bottling so in a bigger bottle , whilst others are duty free specials . 
  these specials range in quality from `` meh '' , to really quite special . 
  right now i have a 1l singleton of glendullen double matured airport special that is quite lovely , and at its price point absolutely perfect for a daily dram . 
  it 's for daily dram purposes i tend to buy the 1l duty free bottles actually , as some really are great value . 
  i was lucky enough to be bought a flight in this beautiful old lady for my birthday at this year 's wanaka airshow . 
  we flew around the area for a decent amount of time , over the beautiful mountains , lakes and gorges that characterise the local scenery , even touching down on lake wanaka and running in the water , fast taxiing , for a good couple of kms !, 
  i also have plenty more shots of the interior , views of the cockpit and views outside , some nicely framed by the observation blisters . 
  if anyone is interested i am happy to add an album in as a comment . 
  the aircraft itself is a canadian built and operated pby-5a amphibian , later bought by the catalina group of nz to honour that nation 's catalina crews and their long hours of service over the pacific during wwii . 
  nz actually only operated seaplanes , not amphibians ; however , `` wandering witch '' is painted in the correct rnzaf markings for their seaplanes ( none of which , sadly , survived ) . 
  she 's a real beauty and i feel both lucky and honoured to have flown in her . 
  those are very similar to my thoughts on the effect of apkws in terms of its impact on the a-x debate . 
  all of a sudden you have a lightweight ( both physically and in requirements for operation ) , cheap precision weapons system that can deliver a lot of effective firepower without needing a terrifically complex platform . 
  apkws has better anti-armour capabilities than even the gau-8 ( though no `` brrrrrrrt '' ... ) and can be carried in serious numbers , as you have discussed . 
  coupled with even a 20mm cannon ( or hack , even the .50 cal minigun equivalents ) you would have a very capable , precise cas system that really could allow the t-x and a-x programs to share an airframe , although the a-x would ideally carry armour and some kind of advanced das . 
  no worries - irl the eyes are actually a quite lifelike and pretty spooky , one may readily understand the soft power projection effect these statues , which were * everywhere * in the empire , must have had , and by extension why the captured head was placed as it was . 
  here 's the wikipedia article for the exhibition if you 're interested ( i think it has links to the associated podcast series too in the references ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_history_of_the_world_in_100_objects, 
  backpackers - the struggle is real !, 
  most progressive country in the me ^ ^ tm, 
  `` i love the smell of napalm in the morning '' . 
  it * does * look pretty wolfish !, 
  guess where you are now banned from ? 
  yep , definitely * gone in sixty seconds * - i mean how much more carzy can you even get ?
