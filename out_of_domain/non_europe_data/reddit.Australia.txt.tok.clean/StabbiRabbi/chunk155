  taken at [ lake matheson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_matheson ) near fox glacier in the south island 's west coastal glacial region . 
  this is one of only two areas in the world where glaciers meet temperate rainforest and is a particularly beautiful part of a notably beautiful country . 
  can also recommend the restaurant at the lake matheson visitor 's centre . 
  actually ate dinner , then breakfast there it was so good !, 
  this shit 's fucked - these are the kind of people who support abbott and have hobbled turnbull from coming through on any of his previously expressed socially liberal views , making him the disappointing lame duck he 's been . 
  they are not people i want to have any influence over my nation 's life , not at all . 
  just another reason i wo n't be voting libs this time round . 
  i count myself as socially liberal , but financially conservative . 
  the libs have totally departed from that path to become socially conservative and economically neo-liberal and it is not doing any of us , barring a few people who are pulling the strings , any good ; neither as individuals , nor as a nation . 
  i 'm sick of it . 
  shit , i had a 16mhz 386sx as our family pc when i was a lad , running ms-dos just before windows 3.1 really became ubiquitous ... 
  yeah , the ins vikramaditya has demonstrated the indian navy 's inherent capability for managing and employing complex weapons systems , such as a csg and its cvw , and with two new supercarriers in the works built with indian steel - well known globally for its quality - and some copied american tech they will become the greatest 3rd-world naval power on the entire planet . 
  india 's `` buy local '' policy for arms is turning out to be a massive boon to the country as systems like the tehas , insas rifle and arjun mbt not only demonstrate indian technological prowess , but allow for indigenously fielded capabilities to support india 's mic as well as providing equipment to its soldiers . 
  plus the t-50a already * has * a ka-50 light attack version in the works , but even the t-50 has full glass cockpit ( one big lcd like an f-35 iirc ) and many of the features of modern fighters so they can be used for training most of the scenarios required , including tactics and weapons delivery with the required subsystems integrated . 
  the spine on it where it 's refuelling receptacle sits looks * exactly * like the spine on the advanced block 50 + / 52 + / 60 f-16ds and presumably could hold some similar ecm/ew kit too . 
  throw relatively cheap flight hours and good manoeuvrability into the mix and you have a pretty compelling package imo . 
  yeah , the balance between good slow speed handling for accurate strafing as well as overall sa and reasonable reaction times is something both the a-10 and its late , great , predecessor the a-1h / j skyraider both got pretty right and is a * key * requirement for a-x . 
  sniper xr equipped bones had fantastic reaction and loiter times as well as an almost unending supply of jdams , but they simply ca n't get down in the weeds ( even apkws would n't give the bone that capability , ha ha ) and they are scarce/expensive resources . 
  a forward-deployable , lightweight , but heavily armed a-x based around t-x would seem to fit the bill nicely though , with a great deal of inherent flexibility . 
  it would also be brilliant in the fac-a/fast-fac role as a tandem seater ; another significant capability that needs to be maintained . 
  a-10s are often used for facing , but so are f/a -18 fs ( and tomcat 's before theme ) - a type that is obviously massive overkill for the role and a type already strained by the number of hats it wears , from barcap to flying gas pump !, 
  any a-x derived from the t-x would by definition be a tandem type , with all the sa advantages this conferred available ootb . 
  i think such funding is essential and obviously a long-term investment that should return significant net gains , but again an australian politician is promising $ bs for a program in the run up to an election like it 's just that easy to find the cash once elected . 
  we need to see proper funding and financial models , properly and independently audited , from ** both ** parties for their promises before they can even begin to be thought of as likely eventualities . 
  it 's all too easy to promise the world , then pull the old `` well things are worse than we thought , but by next budget ... '' switcheroo we have all seen time and time again when crunch time comes . 
  or , worse still really , see the money spent when it should n't have been - leading to things * really * getting worse pretty bloody quickly . 
  our political parties are n't the only global culprits by a long shot and neither is significantly better than the other . 
  both should give us detailed models though - not just sledging of the opposition and promises , promises , promises . 
  holy piss actually , to be precise . 
  you must have had some pretty average weed then . 
  i jumped straight into the good stuff and my first thought was , literally , what else can i smoke now ... ^ ^ / s, 
  * some * of them are quality at a great price . 
  as well as the singleton i mentioned above , i have a nice balvenie 12yo triple cask and a particularly nice for the distillery bowmore black rock that for ~ $ 100 aud 1l is probably the best deal i have had from them , with a lovely soft , lingering peaty finish that 's far , far better than their regular offerings at that price point imo . 
  the singleton is definitely a standout though , with a nicely refined vanilla , sherried finish i could drink all day . 
  it 's definitely worth picking these bottles up , but i do caution it 's always worth researching the options before you 're in the terminal with a connection to make !, 
  just as some are really very good value , others are a waste of money and duty free allowances ... 
  album of shots from the flight . 
  oh man , it was such a great flight , i 'm very happy to share !, 
  honestly , except for a converted to tandem single-seat fighter - eg spitfire , mustang or fw-190 - the cat is one of the top of my personal most desired rides list . 
  i just love their lines and look , i love their capabilities and operational history and i just *** loved *** it when we landed on the lake sooooop much !, 
  it was a great , and uncommon these days , experience in and of itself ; there are n't * too * many people around who have got to experience landing on water in an amphibious catalina i am quite sure ... 
  plus wanaka is such an amazingly beautiful little town , especially from above !, 
  ( lake wanaka has an island with another , little , lake on the island in the lake ! ), 
  i personally like wanaka soooo much more than queenstown ; especially every other easter for the airshow of course , but just generally too because of how much less commercial and touristy it is in comparison . 
  of course that 's just my personal opinion and a lot of people love queenstown to bits too ; different strokes and all that you know . . 
  ty , yep it certainly was a great birthday present - it was a surprise , and i can assure you i felt very spoiled indeed throughout the flight and for quite some time afterward !, 
  that 's a nice pby too , and it 's always great seeing one in flight . 
  dutch catalinas and dornier do 24 flying boats both flew out of northern western australia during wwii ( wa is where i 'm actually from , i was just visiting nz for the airshow/an easter long weekend break ) , including from [ broome where in one notorious incident a number of mld ( dutch naval aviation ) dorniers packed with refugee women and children were destroyed by the japanese during an aerial raid against the city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_on_broome ) . 
  idk whether those aircraft would have been wearing the orange triangles or the round , tricolor roundels seen on the pby in the picture , but i am pretty sure it would have been the round roundels ( as per your picture ) - do you know which markings would have been current when the dutch operated from australia ? 
  you 're obviously not korean ... 
  shorts and t-shirt , trackie daks in winter if it 's a cold night . 
  agreed , it looks waaaay too similar to those old-style plastic linked-ring six pack holders ( you know , the ones banned for being environmentally unsound because they trapped fish ... ) to fulfill its advertised function !, 
  aussie name for sweatpants ( which , i believe , is the american vernacular ) . 
  yes , i read he was disappointed about that too , hence his significant upping of the ante with this presidential run ... 
  trump - uniting the nation !, 
  link does n't work mate . 
  normally that 's not the type of thing i 'd point out for any turd picture , let alone one of someone actually in the act of snapping one off ( whichever this photo captures ) , but , in light of the location , this i got ta see !, 
  pls fix link ... 
  i thought it was a dead kennedys symbol at first glance of the thumbnail , which surprised me because i did n't think their fans and trump 's would overlap at all ; then i read the title and all was illuminated . 
  all the people making `` this is anti-free-speech '' comments itt are kind of missing the point . 
  if he was merely bigoted and offensive then there should and would be less calls for him to stfu ; it 's that he 's also so very irritating and , despite having `` all the best words '' , seemingly incapable of saying anything which is not profoundly stupid that really drives the pleas for silence . 
  aww , who 's a good boy ? 
  how come voting wastes a saturday ? 
  i just pop down to my local primary school and the whole ordeal lasts well under an hour ... 
  not saying early voting is bad , or even that it 's not the smarter way of doing things ; just that even voting normally does n't generally seem * that * onerous an imposition to me , all things considered . 
  does the red symbolise jesus juice ? 
  these are [ maunsell army forts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maunsell_forts#maunsell_army_forts ) and were built to house anti-aircraft-artillery in the thames estuary and liverpool 's mersey river to protect against german air raids . 
  his name was ben zygier and he `` killed himself '' in circumstances that can only be described as highly suspicious given he was in a `` suicide-proof '' cell . 
  he was an australian citizen who had made aaliyah ( moved to israel ) and it is suspected his imprisonment followed him intending to [ reveal information ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-ben-zygier-planned-to-expose-mossad-s-use-of-australian-passports.premium-1.503598 ) about [ mossad 's illegal use of australian passports for clandestine operations in the middle east ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-26/mossad-factory-churned-out-fake-australian/343612 ) , although due to the secrecy surrounding his arrest and subsequent death that is obviously unproven . 
  i 'm sure most , in not all , of that is in the link , considering the article title is `` death of ben zygier '' . 
  this has to be * the * most frequently posted `` mildly interesting '' event that happens to redditors out there , making it something of an irl repost and as such more suited r/mildlytedious imo . 
  though you do also get baby carrots which * are n't * just mini peeled carrots , but are actually [ literal baby carrots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baby_carrot#baby_carrots ) and can be readily identified by the fact they have skin and the sprout left on top ( this is left so they can be readily identified as real baby carrots and charged top dollar for accordingly ) . 
  finally , you can also buy [ dwarf carrots ] ( http://homeguides.sfgate.com/carrots-grown-box-42921.html ) which range from 1 '' -5 '' and are typically grown in urban box gardens !, 
  i never said i disagree with him , did i , or that i agree with those who are calling for him to be silenced ? 
  personally i * like * politicians bigoted , offensive , irritating and stupid - especially when they are not my country 's politicians and they provide such excellent entertainment . 
  nor did i call for him to stfu ; i merely explained why others might hold those views so a ) please do n't put words in my mouth & b ) do n't shoot the messenger . 
  certainly i believe he has now more than earned his hollywood star for providing entertaining tv , even after the points i mentally deduct for * the apprentice * . 
  i 'm all for him , so long as he does n't ever , ever visit australia . 
  [ meanwhile a very quick search proves my point ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/search?q=baby+carrots&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  edit : there are 12 pages there of `` big carrots found in baby carrot bag '' ... 12 . 
  can you find * anything * more frequently posted ? 
  aw , he 's thanking us for our service . 
  wishing someone would shut up is n't the same as wanting to deny them their right to free speech . 
  you also fell into the '' [ affirming the consequent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/affirming_the_consequent ) '' logical fallacy ; your argument is that i was implying the people trying to silence him were justified ( previously referred to by you as people who disagreed with him ) and that i disagree with him : ergo , i want to silence him . 
  however , that 's simply not true . 
  quite aside from the fact that * spraying a mute symbol over his hollywood star * has literally zero effect on his ability to express himself , to the point it ca n't even be said to be `` trying to silence him '' , but is rather * only expressing a desire for him to stfu * , just because something i said * sounds a lot like i disagree with him * it does not logically follow that i * have any desire to silence him * ... 
  as i said before , there 's a big difference between wishing you did n't have to hear something and stopping people from saying it . 
  edit : anyway , as i also already said , i find his bigotry and stupidity amusing ; why would i want to lose all that funny ? 
  there , i did the search for you . 
  top link is from the washington post , the second is the man himself , next is the huffpo , then the guardian ... all well regarded sources ( other than trump , of course ) . 
  no , they are not . 
  it 's like the difference between turning your tv off because you do n't like the program and shooting it for the same reason . 
  one is reasonable , the other a gross overreaction . 
  you have fallen into another common logical fallacy , [ false equivalence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_equivalence ) ... 
  edit : forgot a word and i know you 're struggling with reading comprehension of my comments any , so i thought i 'd best make the edit . 
  it is a tactical fighter , developed from the sukhoi su-27 flanker and as such not much larger than an f-15 . 
  however , it has an [ unusually large cabin for such an aircraft , including - very unusually - a restroom and galley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-34#design ) . 
  other tactical strike aircraft designed for the same role , including the grumman a-6 inruder , gd f-111 and sukhoi su-24 fencer , also utilised side-by-side seating , albeit without restroom or galley . 
  hey do n't worry about it man , it 's no biggie . 
  you 'll notice it soon enough when you 've been using reddit a bit longer .
