  i never learned about indonesia at school ( because i attended primary school in the uk ) , but i had a lot of indo friends at uni ( and outside of uni itself too ) , have colleagues and just generally know quite a few of you guys and a lot about your country because you 're so close ( especially as i live in wa ) . 
  a lot of indonesians live here . 
  a lot happens between our countries and a lot of aussies go to indonesia as well ( not just bali ! ) . 
  we also have quite a few indonesian restaurants in perth , which i like the food of too . 
  yeah , but phonetically `` dzhu '' * could * be read as `` jew '' so , yeah , er , case closed methinks . 
  the fish is n't really cute enough to make this a `` double aww '' , but cool picture . 
  ugly rings there though . 
  this is one of those airport specials i believe ; i certainly picked up a bottle from an airport duty free and it comes in the 1l bottling that the airport specials do . 
  i agree it was * ok * , but nothing special . 
  it 's pretty much what you 'd expect from a px laphroig expression , but with nothing to make it really stand out . 
  there are much better options if you 're going through an airport , although this certainly is not bad value for money . 
  i think i must have caught the lesser version - i certainly would n't compare it to the 18 . 
  as to buying it again ? 
  for me probably not , but only because there are other bottles from the duty free i like better and i am only allowed 2.2 l coming back in to my country !, 
  the two i have enjoyed most are the singleton of glendullen double matured and balvenie 12yo triple cask - both are 1l for ~ $ 100 aud ( or equivalent in other countries ) . 
  i have bought both a couple of times . 
  another one which i found very nice is the bowmore 's black rock , which has a nice long-lingering , but more subtle than usual peaty finish . 
  one of bowmore 's better efforts , especially for the price ( same as the other two ) . 
  i wonder which one is the guy who always sticks up for ksa in r/worldnews ? 
  that 's the israeli security forces for you ... 
  i think calling the corsair iis slufs was a little unkind ; they do n't have the slick grace of their gunfighting big brother crusaders , but they do look like they get the job done . 
  and of course they did get the job done too , which counts for a lot in my warplane estimation . 
  you have to love these '60s / '70s usn colours too , before everything went tactical grey with just the cag bird 's tail having a any colour or variation ( though i still love all those cag bird schemes too !, 
  like , far out man . 
  but , but ... 
  they 're both black . 
  at least that would piss the original author right off ; i 'm sure he 'd hate being coloured ~ ~ coon ~ ~ black .

  tbf this is not a partisan issue and would be going on under labor too - the reason the scam works so well is because the corruption is kept hidden among various immigrant communities , something any government is susceptible to . 
  that is not to say that the libs are blameless , or that this should not be investigated and the relevant law strictly adhered to . 
  it is disingenuous of the alp to try to make it a partisan issue though , especially as their stance on immigration has been so close to the libs in its focus on illegal boat arrivals . 
  the establishment of the faintly ridiculously-named `` border force '' may not have helped the issue , but it did not cause it . 
  i have personally been told about such scams from friends in the indian community , where such visa cheating is taken for granted and has been part of the landscape since well before the libs regained power . 
  the issue makes my blood boil on so many levels , but personally i feel the introduction of systemic corruption into our culture is the most damaging aspect of the situation as it stands and with the system having been gamed for so long it is , disappointingly , becoming a systemic issue . 
  immigration is such a massive net positive for our nation that it should be facilitated by our government , but in a fair and evenly applied manner . 
  unfortunately in this scenario those who pay the bribes are victims too ; however , they must also be punished to stamp the corruption out , even though it is the middlemen , businesses and even ( shamefully ) our bureaucrats who are they real villains of the piece . 
  ireland is part of britain geographically ( ie one of the british isles ) , though not part of great britain , the nation ... 
  does * that * trigger you ? 
  is `` an execution '' how you refer to `` snapping one off '' ( in the scatological , not masturbatory , sense ) ? 
  yeah , it was hard to pick just one , but i thought the back-lit profile had a nice `` wow '' factor to it . 
  i included the link a ) to follow the rules and give credit where it was due & b ) to share the whole set because , as you say , it 's full of great pictures . 
  ( the article text is itself interesting too ... ), 
  no rendang ? 
  so hard to choose at malaysian restaurants though , is n't it ? 
  i love hainan chicken ( steamed chicken rice ) and satay too and both look * great * . 
  that 's a big plate of gyoza !, 
  looks awesome though , i can see why you ordered a few . 
  and now i 'm drooling at my desk again . 
  you should have included a banana , you know for scale ... 
  i guess that must be a small serving plate then , not a full-sized one ? 
  oh come now , that 's a very disingenuous reply . 
  it is always claimed that the palestinians hate jews , not israel ( by israeli propagandists/apologists , both official and hobbyist , at least - even if nobody else in the entire world * believes that to be true * ... ) . 
  accordingly it * would be * `` jewwatch.org '' ; this is particularly true as israelis deny there is even a palestinian nation ( i mean , they deny there is a palestinian people too , but the analogue * would be * `` jewwatch.org '' and not `` israelwatch.org '' if one follows what passes for logic among the spittle-flecked `` explanations '' of israel 's apologists ... ) . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what ? 
  that 's actually an f/a -18 f super hornet rather than an ea-18g growler - those are missile rails ( with a single sidewinder on the right wing ) on the wingtips , not the ew/ecm pods mounted on a growler . 
  the 135 modex ( number on the nose ) is the same as the boeing demonstrator pictured on the [ wikipedia f/a -18 e/f page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_f/a-18e/f_super_hornet#/media/file:f_18_super_hornet_at_aero_india_2011_ ( 8th_edition_of_aero_india \\ ) . jpg ) at aero india so perhaps it 's the boeing demo aircraft transiting for a demo or airshow ? 
  ( though that picture was 2011 , so it may not be the same aircraft . ), 
  edit : corrected the designation for the growler - thanks to u/rod _ djeval 's superior proofreading skills . 
  same same as labor mate , they 're both as bad as each other . 
  personally i intend to throw * my * vote away on minor parties ... 
  yes , it would have been better phrased as both employ reproductive strategies involving mating with non-human mammals ... 
  do israelis/israeli apologists * really * not understand how evil the colonial project in the occupied territories truly is , and how close their state is coming towards evolving from its present crypto-fascism to actual , literal , '20s - '30s style `` classic '' fascism ? 
  if they do n't , what binds the scales to their eyes ; if they do see the truth then why are they so vocal denying it ? 
  do they really think the rest of the world ca n't see through straight through their dissimulation and disingenuity to the underlying hate-filled bigotry that underpins this colonialism ? 
  if they see no moral issues with it , why deny what 's going on ? 
  doh , dumb mistake . 
  ty , but i 'll leave it so i do n't orphan your comment now ... 
  ear plugs ? 
  edited so that it all still makes sense , though i 'm happy enough to delete all the way up to cover up my gaffe !, 
  i also took the opportunity and fixed my spelling of boeing , which had also been bothering me ( i had `` boening '' the second time !, 
  very nice model of one of my favourite aircraft - `` sock it to 'em '' is a brilliant subject . 
  the aircraft 's pilot , george j. marrett , wrote a great book about his experiences flying skyraiders called * cheating death : combat air rescues in vietnam and laos * which i recommend unreservedly to anyone who is interested in the air war in sea generally or the experiences of skyraider pilots in particular . 
  i bet your uncle has some interesting stories , the 6th sos were ( and are to this day ) a very interesting squadron . 
  i really enjoyed marrett 's book even without any personal connexion because it 's well written and about a fascinating aspect of the war i find interesting anyway ( i have read a bunch of memoirs of pilots flying out of thailand - as facs , in spads , in spectre gunships , thuds , spooks and etc. . . ) . 
  there 's another book by a guy who flew with the squadron too , albeit briefly due to a crash early in his tour , that you might also find interesting ( he also flew two interesting sea tours in different types before going back to fly spads ) : http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18891871-one-trip-too-many---a-pilot-s-memoirs-of-38-months-in-combat-over-laos, 
  finally , queued on my kindle , but not yet read is this ( spads flying sandy/firefly mission , but with the 1st sos though i think due to cover photo with ` tc ' tailcode instead of ` tt ' ... ) : http://fireflythebook.com/, 
  edit : just looked through his website and there are ` tt ' tailcodes - firefly/sandy was the 6th sos too so maybe he did fly with them after all , or perhaps both squadrons ? 
  anyway , i think i 'll start reading * firefly * next after talking about it now ... 
  no , i have n't read that , but i certainly will . 
  the misty facs were interesting and flew pretty hairy missions judging by the number of decorations they picked up ! . 
  thx for the recommendation too .

  i laughed too - politics all over the world is a bad joke right about now , though here in australia we 're certainly still leading the way in that regard . 
  thank fuck the election 's on saturday and after that they 'll all stfu ( well , relatively compared to now ) for a while again !, 
  yeah , that 's another great book , as is [ going downtown ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1660816.going_downtown ) , also by jack broughton ( although there is some repetition between the two as the reviewer on goodreads notes ) - those thud pilots did it pretty hard . 
  that 's pretty cool your uncle is featured in * thud ridge * of all the sea air war memoirs out there , it 's certainly one of the absolute classics of the genre . 
  i too am fascinated by the sea air war ; it 's great there are so many good books on the subject . 
  well not as much of it at least ... 
  i suspect shorten is one of those talking heads that wo n't stop yapping no matter what , more 's the pity . 
  cool , thx for that link ; i have n't read that piece . 
  a bit more recently ( relatively at least , sometime within the past 5yrs ... ) the smithsonian air & space magazine published a couple of articles about the sandy mission - one about skyraiders over sea and another about a-10s currently - in the same issue as each other . 
  if you have n't read them they 're good too . 
  you can tell it 's old by the way the pieces of pepperoni are curled up at the edges like that ... 
  yes , i mean given how long the mongols ruled iceland it 's highly likely that he would be ... 
  internet of things is already happening around us and will be an ubiquitous change in all kinds of technology that will further enable other , more immediately `` wow '' advances on its back . 
  good news for the [ us strategic helium reserve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_helium_reserve ) and helium users everywhere . 
  now we can all have squeaky voice whenever we feel like it - without feeling guilt for depleting a finite resource !, 
  it is in israel , but only due to the zionists ' territorial aggression ; it was originally allocated to palestine , and even now is known as the `` arab capital of israel '' . 
  so in every moral sense it is part of palestine ; in practical terms though it is sadly part of israel .
