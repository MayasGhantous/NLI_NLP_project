  an israeli talking about lies * the palestinians * tell . 
  how cute . 
  creepy , but cute . 
  is n't it a bit tautologous , having both `` politicians '' and `` lie '' in the same sentence ? 
  i 'm not voting liberal , but i must say it 's shorten who came out of this sounding like the more dishonest of the two for persisting with his `` no , this time we * really * mean it '' *** lies *** . 
  tbf that is also quite a large looking cat , judging by its size relative to the normal-sized door . 
  how is just * talking * ever less lazy than taking physical action ? 
  nope , they 're actually * making * me plan to vote independent , greens or minor party . 
  otoh the alp 's `` mediscare '' rubbish and * endless * promises , especially as delivered by bill `` the least sincere man in the world '' shorten , have made me go from just rolling my eyes at their cheeky blarney to actively despising them too . 
  both major parties are totally non-options for me this time round . 
  gee , they do n't leave much on the bone for you , do they ? 
  mine 's about the same , but in the spirit of brexit i plan on making my non-major party votes count as protest votes ... 
  it `` worked '' for them after all ; the main difference is that having both the libs and alp stymied here is something i think would actually benefit our nation , at least until one of them starts developing policies beyond not being the other . 
  the good thing to come out of this election is , i think , that voter loyalty ( ie just voting for `` your '' party ) is becoming less and less prevalent among more and more people ... 
  nope , no good options . 
  they really are interchangeable , having adopted the worst of each 's original positions and mushed it all up into a mixture equally bland and repulsive ( no mean feat ! ) . 
  the senate reining in the insanity of whichever wins is our best hope at this point , both for a country i actually want to live in and to provide amusement by frustrating the talking head at the top ... 
   status : extinct, 
  are you * sure * ? 
  because i saw this documentary ... 
  agreed . 
  yeah it sounds like their policies would all cause significant health issues - that must be what their party name refers to i guess ? 
  that 's an * interesting * interpretation . 
  or are was your comment not part of the conversation and you want us to play one of those games where we take turns saying random stuff vaguely related to the article to each other then try to guess what 's meant , and that was your turn ? 
  um , ok ... you 're saying they do n't count as israeli because ... 
  they are n't allowed to have a tv station with programming that relates to them and their interests ? 
  is that it ? 
  did i guess write ? 
  i know israel does n't `` do '' free speech as in 1st amendment type free speech , so it was n't that . 
  so now what ? 
  do you tell me if i guessed right or do i just go ? 
  no need to try to make a cunt out of him . 
  you mean the country that has weaponised unsolicited nuisance calls ... 
  their citizens will never sit down to dinner in peace !, 
  never !, 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm afraid that is a perfectly legitimate usage . 
  the bong makes it sfw , it 's not like it 's * just * a nude , dude ... 
  yes , a lot of things are * said * , fewer things are * true * ... 
  though i guess the ruaf *** must *** be pretty confident in the t-50s superiority seeing as they 're only building 12 to face off against not just the f-22s , but the entirety of nato 's combined air arms !, 
  yes . 
  yes . 
  blame the holy site 's legitimate owners for not wanting * their * holy site bulldozed so the mythical temple of david ( never actually proven to exist , or have existed , anywhere outside the pages of the bible 's old testament ) can be looked for and `` rebuilt '' ( stupid word for it , but that 's the one the wicked ultra-zionists who would destroy the beautiful - and real - al-aqsa mosque to build some kind of gaudy , tacky glorified synagogue on the site actually say . 
  literally ... ) !, 
  feed on it , grow strong in your ultra-zionist extreme nationalistic bigotry ... let your anger be all the justification you need to excuse colonialism and apartheid . 
  dude , it does n't have to be like that !, 
  i am actually a zionist myself , but one in the sense i believe profoundly in israel 's right to exist safely as a self-determined state where the jews can have a home ; however , i * do not * support the extermination of the palestinians and their culture any more than i would that of israel itself !, 
  edit : in case some crybully mistakes my comment as some kind of veiled attack on israel or jewish people ( despite the words and everything ) it is not . 
  it is merely saying the religious nationalist right wing in israel who are at the root of this trouble should n't be encouraged or supported . 
  especially if you think peace would be like , you know , kinda cool sometime . 
  the f-22a has had a slew of development and enhancement since entering service . 
  most recently publicised have been constant software updates , the integration of helmet-cued aim-9x sidewinders and the development of new equipment for stealthy data transfer with other platforms ( initially raptors could only datalink with other raptors in low emissions mode ) . 
  there is now even talk of restarting production , perhaps of a version mounting the f-35s sensors and avionics . 
  so the program is far from buried ; it 's not even dead . 
  also because they were not in relationships there was a far lower incidence of the women killing the men , either directly by violence or slowly , as a drop of water wears down a mountain , with daily cruelties and stresses . 
  edit : i do n't understand the downvotes , i do n't mean * all * women are like that ( that would be horridly misogynyistic ! ), 
  or that no men suffer from some form of mental illness/defect that renders them literally just as bad , just that a smallish ( but statistically significant ) number of women are . 
  of course big government is going to come down on the side of big pharma !, 
  it 's big money for all of them , with communist compulsory government healthcare being the biggest scam out there ... 
  they 're all just trying to smother the alternative health movement because we threaten their fat cat lifestyles and means of control , man . 
  lol . 
  no way . 
  i 'm australian and i think our health system is great , having experienced it at close hand personally and with people very close to me . 
  i trust what they tell me ( albeit not blindly , of course ) and am sure their research is right . 
  why does your watch have moisture inside it in the first place ? 
  i apologise to any reasonable israelis who respect the rights of the waqf , but have seen too many of the ultra-zionists i specifically criticise talking about literally destroying the mosque , a notion i find deeply unpleasant despite having no connexions to islam myself . 
  these people ( who are the only israelis i actually criticise in my comment ) utterly refute the legitimacy of the islamic rights to the mount - exactly as i did for the judaic . 
  furthermore , i believe that if such people were not so aggressive in their behaviour there would not be so much conflict over the mosque/mount and jews would be allowed greater freedoms . 
  i consider it hypocritical that so many restrictions are placed on the palestinians in every aspect of their daily lives , yet so much outrage is generated over jews being not allowed to visit a single location , that is now a shared holy site . 
  perhaps my comment was to an extent somewhat heavy-handed and my discussion of the history a tad one-sided ; however , i was trying to highlight the bias inherent in the comment i replied to , which was every bit as unfair ( in the context of the entire situation ) as mine was when examined from a neutral position . . 
  true , but the al-aqsa has been there a very long time now and is objectively a very beautiful building which deserves protection as a cultural edifice regardless of its religious significance . 
  i realise my comment was very one-sided and disregarded even the legitimate jewish connexions to the site , but i was seeking to make a point about the comment i replied to which seemed to me to entirely disregard legitimate muslim concerns regarding the mosque 's safety from those ultra-zionists i specifically criticised . 
  i personally would like to see jews allowed more freedom to visit the site , but only if they can do so respectfully . 
  as a ( secular , cultural ) christian i too would be disallowed access , which is sad from my perspective . 
  i just ca n't help but feel if the ultra-zionists to whom i referred would refrain from openly planning a third temple there would be fewer incidents and less tension surrounding the issue . 
  these guys should use this as their tagline : `` health australia party - fully sick ! '', 
  he has no specific point of view or thoughts beyond `` israel perfect ; palestine evil '' ; instead he just nitpicks at the comments of those that do actually possess thoughts of their own which have the temerity to challenge the legitimacy of this singular belief . 
  i find it hilariously ironic that israel portrays itself as the tragic hero even with the naming of this policy , as though israel is the plucky little fighter defending itself against an overwhelmingly more powerful opponent bent on its destruction , when in reality the exact opposite is the truth in this situation ... 
  q : what 's something 9/10 people enjoy ? 
  a : gang rape . 
  that 's methed up !, 
   the `` hannibal directive '' restricted normal limitations of force, 
  do n't you mean * the `` hannibal directive '' permitted the unrestrained use of force * ** or ** * the `` hannibal directive '' removed the usual rules of engagement that usually interfere with the idf 's ability to commit all the many war crimes as they would otherwise like to * ? 
  why would you phrase it in such an indirect way ? 
  edit : made the `` or '' bold to highlight that there are two separate alternative phrasings suggested in place of the op 's weasel wording ... 
  i wonder if she 's * still * going to vote for the '' health australia party * ? 
  i think if how i phrased it was not entirely accurate , it was certainly much closer to the truth that your choice of words . 
   the `` hannibal directive '' did not permit the unrestrained use of force, 
  oh , so the military officials who released the press release which led to the article were lying ? 
  to quote the article :, 
   which calls for the use of maximum force to prevent the capture of israeli soldiers , even at the risk of harming them, 
  could you explain the difference between `` maximum '' and unrestrained '' use of force ? 
  us native english speakers , we just go by the meanings of the words used in a body of text to extract the overall meaning of what 's written , but luckily you guys are always here to `` explain '' : so , please explain . 
   nor did the directive allow for the committing of war crimes . 
  so the israeli comptroller was lying . 
  i mean , it 's his report that the following paragraph refers to , is n't it ? 
   a coming report by israel 's state comptroller had recommended that the army abolish the procedure because different ranks and units interpreted it differently and its use might have * violated international law * . 
  [ emphasis my own . ], 
  again , if you could detail the difference between `` the military violating international law with the use of excessive force '' and `` committing a war crime '' that would be very helpful ... 
   kidnapped soldier ( which is actually quite a serious war crime ), 
  is the difference i am missing that the * captured * soldiers in question are israeli ( making their capture a `` war crime '' ) , whereas the people murdered during the excessively violent efforts to retrieve them are n't and so their deaths * are n't * war crimes ?
