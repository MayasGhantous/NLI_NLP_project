  ) , the north atlantic , for the pinprick , but effectively stinging commando raids , and etc. . . ; however , the best use might have been opening up the second front earlier . 
  ( doing so might have spared some of europe the subsequent horrors of communist occupation post-war apart from anything else , as might a speedier and more quickly successful italian campaign ... ), 
  at the bombing campaign 's height in late - '44 ** 1.3 m ** usaaf and raf/raaf/rnzaf / rcaf personnel were engaged in the bombing , employing nearly 30k aircraft . 
  combined losses of aircrew were 160k . 
  that 's a couple of armies worth there . 
  of course it 's easy to be an armchair general with the benefit of hindsight , but if you 'll just quit hyperventilating long enough to read what i 'm saying you 'll see that i 'm not `` so critical '' over the campaign , but rather am just pointing out that it was one of the campaigns whose value is * still * most debated among historians . 
  i have never said it was useless ; the closest i came was offering my * opinion * that it was n't necessarily something that should be celebrated unreservedly , for a host of reasons . 
  never less than extraordinary is certainly one way of putting things ... 
  i have seen one guy get more than 10,000 downvotes for a single comment , so you can definitely do it !, 
  here 's the link - he made a cynical crack in the midst of the firing of victoria ( u/chooter ) ama admin firing reddit scandal ... 
  a bit of a perfect storem scenario , but keep your eyes peeled and you might spot a similar opportunity !, 
  pointing out indisputable historical facts that do n't sit comfortably with the israeli perennial victimhood false narrative , or sharing opinions that are n't 100 % supportive of that country 's extreme right-wing zealots view of the situation in palestine , is guaranteed to garner many , many downvotes . 
  they do not like facts , or that other people hold differing opinions whatsoever . 
  even if you explain you actually support israel 's right to existence and self-determination and do n't support terrorism , unless you paint israel as entirely blameless and unfairly picked-upon you * will * get heavily downvoted . 
  edit : even in this dusty corner of reddit some fan of fascism israeli sought me out to mash that downvote button as viciously as they possibly could ; thus my point is proven . 
  nothing offensive about this one , it 's just hilarious how everything can be made a flag in the usa !, 
  captured that rottie face perfectly . 
  reminds me of my dearly departed old girl , especially the eyes . 
  thanks , i miss her , but even the pain of the loss is worthwhile after all the good times we shared . 
  their eyes are the sweetest : so expressive , so much love !, 
  yeah , all queensland seems to be good for is voting in racist bitches . 
  pauline hanson getting ** 9 % ** of the primary vote in queensland is , to me as a non-banana-bending aussie , both shameful and shocking . 
  looks a bit like a bbq chicken in that pose to me . 
  i always upvote rotties , they 're my personal favourite dogs . 
  so smart , loyal and affectionate ; they really do n't deserve their `` mean dog '' reps !, 
  `` as you sow , so shall you reap '' is , i believe , the appropriate expression here . 
  the us government is a notoriously antisemitic institution that exists solely to unfairly criticise the noble people and peace-loving of israel !, 
  no , wait . 
  that 's the un , amnesty international and save the children fund ... 
  er , well , the current barack hussein obama-led us regime is intransigently opposed to israel 's security as may be seen by the iran `` stab-in-the-back '' deal and related massive , multi-billion dollar aid package which is intended not to help israel defend itself , but to limit the israeli defence industry from competing with the us arms manufacturers and funnel money back into the us economy as sneakily as one would expect from those filthy antisemites ... 
  or something ( netanyahu has the details , and one of his army of internet helpers will no doubt be along soon to help explain the precise details to us antisemites surely , i am quite sure ... ), 
  it is entirely possible to live one 's entire life here without * ever * actually being attacked by anything deadly . 
  ( though tbf that 's primarily because drop bears do n't go for people with aussie accents ... ), 
  cunt , while used a lot more freely than it is in the us , is * not * spoken in polite conversation . 
  otoh , we * do * eat vegemite with everything . 
  oh , there 's a difference ? 
  obviously i feel sympathy for the victims injured and killed in this attack , but it 's * very * hard to empathise with either the ksa regime or any muslims who only now see islamic fundamentalist terrorism as a problem . 
  for them i shall cry precisely the number of tears they have shed for westerners , israelis , or muslims of a different sect ... 
  that is , to be explicit , none . 
  as well as reaching renewables targets of course - gravity is an energy source which is quite literally inexhaustible after all . 
  we should all applaud the usps for this far-sighted and both economically and environmentally responsible policy . 
  if the government wo n't enforce adequate renewables policies it 's good that the market is stepping up . 
  which does n't mean i trust the market to do so ; our government really needs to lift our environmental game , even when this has come to pass . 
  the economic policy aspect is generally referred to as globalisation , whilst globalism is as you describe . 
  i wonder if op * meant * `` globalisation '' ; it 's hard to see globalism as a negative ... 
  i would have to say nuclear armageddon - not only is it terrifyingly destructive , it 's also frighteningly possible . 
  that looks remarkably like my cousin ... 
  i really hope that he gets a significant sentence ; i can not accept he was not responsible and culpable for her death and the punishment should reflect the crime . 
  it 's one of the worst aspects of the handling of this entire case imo ; i can only imagine how hearing that makes the steenkamps feel . 
  this was not a unique incident , pistorius quite clearly allowed himself greater latitude in his behaviour than do we mere mortals , engaging in reckless and obsessive acts frequently that ultimately led to this tragic murder . 
  he should not be * rewarded * for his overweening hubris by being treated as a `` fallen hero '' ; it is not a good message to send and ultimately will not help him battle whatever demons drive his appallingly arrogant actions . 
  * wound up ... 
  grammar nazi hat off now , the whole mayan end of the world 2012 thing was a * massive * flop , though i do notice that the more optimistic doomsayers are saying those calculations were wrong and it 's actually going down * this * year , 2016 . 
  personally , i 'm not holding my breath ... 
  yeah you can cancel the call to mulder and scully ; someone 's wife/girlfriend/boyfriend / husband/au pair was not quite as kinky as their partner hoped ... 
  looks much better than the last post with this title , i must say . 
  what fish did you use ? 
  is that beer batter ? 
  anyway , it 's clearly not * oven baked * ( as was the previous contestant ) so +1 for that alone . 
  the whole experience is full of ~ ~ semen ~ ~ seaman . 
  submariners to be precise . 
  mein apologies !, 
  for the first paragraph at least . 
  the rest is scarcely hyperbolic , just the mainstream historical perspective ... 
  i think the interesting take home is a ) the relative lack of knowledge evinced by the israeli population of various aspects of the situation ( is what we pro-peace people view as mulish intransigence simply mere ignorance ? 
  interesting question , and something that would fit my view that israelis are n't actually evil , but rather are justifiably angered and frightened by the `` inexplicable '' attacks they suffer and grossly misinformed by the extreme right with their politics of fear and etc. . . ) & b ) fully 1/3 endorse annexation with no rights for the indigenous , palestinian population ( which - given that 1/3 is less than 1/2 - does not contradict my priorly expressed optimism ... ) . 
  the other interesting thing about this article is the source , tbh if it was haaretz 's i probably would n't have posted the link , but jpost is usually so right-wing that i found their honesty intriguing and refreshing ; certainly worth sharing . 
  sure , ok . 
  sorry if you felt i was being rude , i did n't mean to be in the middle of an actual , direct conversation . 
  i felt i * did * address * all * your previous points , but then i 've been out of school a while now so may have lost some of my referencing skills ... 
  btw , could you provide * just one * link to you providing * me * with any * credible * sources regarding palestinian opinions ? 
  a link to just one of the `` countless '' comments to which you refer will do just fine . 
  pretend to have jewish ancestry and move into a west bank colony . 
  ( note : this is only entirely legal under israeli law ; international law being wilfully ignored by the israeli `` legal '' system ... ), 
  she knows he 's for the chop if she beats trump ; why give him any attention when his end is nigh ? 
  $ hillary and trump seem pretty neck and neck , at least as far as people who will actually go to the main vote go ... 
  that depends on your perspective . 
  for example , naftali bennett and his jewish home ~ ~ gang ~ ~ party would be delighted ; however , i believe * most * mainstream israeli citizens would be horrified . 
  the international community would then be forced to act too , so in purely practical terms , yes , it would be a grievous error in judgement . 
  i hope that disapproval of bennett , shaked , smotrich et al is at least one thing you and i can both agree upon ... 
  one hopes not , but ca n't help but fear they will try and consequences be damned ... 
  oh , i can do better if you 'd like , though not without lapsing into the questionable ones i had heretofore eschewed ... 
  that was quite charming indeed , though like her i was baffled by a couple of them ... 
  the dogs eye one for example , wtf is that ? 
  whybor is a perfectly cromulent word !, 
  [ for anyone interested in the x-planes , i can not recommend this book highly enough ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25903468-the-big-book-of-x-bombers-x-fighters ) . 
  i bought it for my tablet , but a hardcover would be great too . 
  this book covers every detail , and is absolutely fascinating . 
  neat , honestly had n't that before . 
  is it a state thing ? 
  ( i 'm in wa ... ), 
  ha ha , that 's great !, 
  dinky di is like true blue , means the real thing . 
  yeah a lot of old slang is fading away , more 's the pity . 
  i really like it , though i do n't rip it out in a standard conversation ( usually ... ) . 
  yeah , slang is fading away just like regional accents are in many places . 
  it 's a shame , it can be very precisely expressive as well as good fun . 
  i 've noticed quite a few older people saying hooroo a lot recently , but that seems to be a bit too self-conscious and forced for me to get into . 
  yeah same , she described most of it exactly as i would use it . 
  there were heaps more they could have done too , but that was a good selection .
