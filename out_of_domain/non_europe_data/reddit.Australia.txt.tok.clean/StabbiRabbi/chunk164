   that 's antisemitic you know . 
  and so it just keeps on rolling on ... 
  please do n't look at australia , please do n't look at australia , please do n't look at australia ... 
  goering basically mismanaged the luftwaffe to the point that well before the allies ' final victory the luftwaffe had long-since ceased to function as an effective fighting force . 
  there were severe failures in terms of the development of new types and the right types of aircraft required as the war evolved , meaning that the mid - '30s me-109 ( albeit updated ) was still the mainstay of the fighter fleet in '45 while the me 262 was ignored , then rushed into service while it was still severely underdeveloped and not fit for proper , operational service . 
  huge amounts of effort , resources and time were wasted on dead-end projects such as the rocket-powered me-163 interceptor that had literally no impact on the outcome of the air war . 
  no heavy bomber types were developed , meaning the luftwaffe never evolved past being the wehrmacht 's flying artillery , while other nations evolved strategically valuable heavy bombers capable of carrying large payloads over massive distances . 
  again , the types they started the war with were not replaced , so in '45 the mainstays of what bombing capability the luftwaffe * did * possess were the same aircraft as fought in the battle of britain five years earlier . 
  production of the aircraft they did manufacture was terribly mismanaged in and of itself . 
  training of new crews did not keep up with losses , and the best pilots flew until they died ; this meant that instead of their knowledge and skills being passed on they were squandered for short-term gains . 
  chief-of-staff ernst udet ( and , iirc , his successor ! ), 
  killed himself , such were the stresses that goering 's combination of grandiloquent promises and leadership failings/disinterest ( as he looted europe of art instead of managing the luftwaffe ) placed onto him . 
  last ( for this comment ) , but certainly not least were the promises , all of which failed - `` no enemy aircraft will fly over the reich '' and `` the luftwaffe can supply the army trapped in the stalingrad pocket `` are two of the most famous and most egregious of these promises which completely and utterly were not upheld as germany was smashed by allied heavy bombers day and night while the troops trapped in the stalingrad pocket starved and ran out of ammunition ... 
  i 'm sure trump has this one covered . 
  if not hillary definitely does , with her banker mates and all ... 
  you never really know with these younger americans though . 
  if he is trolling it 's in * incredibly * poor taste ... 
  yeah , i 'm mean that 's what makes them troll , but if this is trolling and not na\u00efvet\u00e9 it 's fucking * brutal * trolling ... 
  no worries , should n't feed them . 
  the thread was pretty young when i found it and he had n't shown his true colours at that stage ... 
  hey , do n't * we * have * our * eyes on nz ourselves ? 
  that 's an awesome picture man , i 'm very jealous . 
  they were always a good squadron , and their jets always looked great . 
  ( strictly from reading about them for me , but i bet your dad has some great stories ! ), 
  ha ha , that video is hilarious - there 's a [ couple more too ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t1o1mvso_38 ) . 
  i think it 's because the focus is on the plane landing ( or perhaps taking off ... ) in the background , rather than the figure of the person and the aircraft in the foreground . 
  it 's a bit of a weird picture to get your own eyes to focus on , but that 's kind of why i liked it , as well as its content of f-35b operational training . 
  they 're getting pretty close to rolling out the euroradar aesa on the german operational test and eval aircraft , but it 's not in service yet . 
  wo n't be long though . 
  however , even then eurofighter typhoon wo n't have the stealt and data fusion capabilities of the f-35 ... 
  i clearly recall that when i was at school half of australia 's annual gdp growth was directly attributable to immigration . 
  as you say , all immigrants require goods and services ; everything from consumer goods to essentials like food and of course a place to live : this actually stimulates the economy , driving growth . 
  yes , it does require investment in infrastructure to support more people , but even that puts money into the economy as much as it requires government spending . 
  the economic argument against immigration is bullshit . 
  [ here is just one article on the subject , though there are many more out there if this is not to your taste ... ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-21/carvalho-why-migrants-may-be-our-greatest-economic-asset/6409042 ) . 
  one has to wonder whether shayla was confused by the `` real-world '' aspect and thought she and the unfortunate deceased were in competition for the same pokemon , with tragic consequences for her competitor . 
  kind of makes sense ... 
  as a frontline air superiority fighter at least - the hurribombers did good work after that , but even their utility was only good for a couple more years , before the typhoons and tempests took over the cas/interdiction role with * vastly * superior performance - especially the tempests !, 
  the eurofighter does have advanced rwr hardware already with irst too , so i 'm sure they will integrate the aesa with those sensors for combined benefit in terms of data collection and fusion onboard the aircraft itself . 
  pods to allow comms between the stealthy datalinks used by the f-22 / f-35 ( which themselves are n't even compatible iirc ) and 4th gen platforms like the f-15 / f-16 ( and thus presumably the eurofighter , the pods are just standard interface hardware ) are currently in trial and , when deployed , will allow the eurofighter to stealthily communicate with each other and other assets . 
  ( they already can listen stealthily via link-16 , but of course as soon as they transmit they give away their location . ), 
  however , the f-35 has the whole concept of sensor fusion and information management built-in from birth and some systems ( eg helmet , 360 degree look around , etc ) will probably remain unique to the f-35 until new platforms emerge following on from the f-35 . 
  they were in the balkans as peacekeepers . 
  this list treats any british soldier being there , ever , for any reason so it 's not really very honestly titled . 
  well put old chap !, 
  yeah , but they do n't know what it 's like to be white and have some darkie take your jerb either . 
  so really * they * need to stfu , not us . 
  pauline was voted for by a majority of queenslanders so we have to respect the banana benders and give her a fair go too . 
  that 's the aussie way mate , a fair go for everyone . 
  which that indian fella would understand if he was an aussie . 
  markings uneven , 4/10 . 
  would not pet . 
  ^ ^ jk , ^ ^ very ^ ^ cute , ^ ^ but ^ ^ why ^ ^ would ^ ^ you ^ ^ feel ^ ^ you ^ ^ even ^ ^ have ^ ^ to ^ ^ ask ? 
  easy tiger , it was a joke . 
  tbh , i thought using the word `` jerb '' would tip people off , but would you like me to add a '' *** / s *** ? 
  incorrect use of apostrophes to indicate plurality , in terms of english language writing style fashion at least . 
  most . 
  ever . 
  yep , medicare will be gone by next week . 
  all labour protections two weeks later , at the same time creationism becomes the only science taught in schools and universities . 
  if only bill had won !, 
  the next three years would be * completely * different . 
  who 's going to discover the unicorn now the libs are back in , with their cuts to education and sciences ? 
  wo n't someone think of the unicorns ? 
  well , [ lady ada lovelace ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ada_lovelace ) is generally recognised as the first computer programmer , from the late-19th century . 
  being so involved in science and work is kind of taking a stand in and of itself for a noble lady of the era . 
  perhaps you could look into her more ? 
  yeah , he wanted a more credible , less hysterical source . 
  that 's why people ask for a source other than the daily mail . 
  in terms of seeking agenda free reporting , i 'm sorry , but being directed to `` palwatch.org '' somehow just does n't inspire confidence . 
  that 's it , with things as tight as they are we wo n't see any really brutal new policies or cuts . 
  even if the libs ' right-wing felt confident enough , they just do n't have the numbers ... 
  of course that requires a great deal of trust in the translators and editors of `` palwatch.org '' , does n't it ? 
  thanks , i will !, 
  seriously though , instead of providing an even relatively unbiased , mainstream source ( bbc , reuters , etc - take your pick ) you expect us to either blindly trust either `` palwatch.org '' or the dail bloody mail , and if - god forbid - we * do n't * feel comfortable with placing our trust blindly in these paragons of objectivity and transparent neutral reportage , well then , then the onus is on * we * , doubting thomases that we are , to find an arabic speaker to confirm the veracity of what you tell us ... 
  all that for a reddit comment . 
  could you not simply provide a source which meets your own standards for impartiality for sources provided to you by others that happen to be reporting on israeli malfeasance ? 
  or is it that the same standards do not , for some reason unapparent to the world at large , apply when one is criticising the palestinians as when one is questioning israel 's activities ? 
  may i suggest the same advice to you , next time you question the source of a report regarding some israeli infraction of legal or moral mores ? 
  or , i ask again , do different standards apply to pro-palestinian/peace sources and pro-israeli ? 
  i was fair dinkum flat out like a lizard drinking all bloody arvo . 
  you 're a real glass-half-empty kind of guy are n't you - the slash was an `` or '' , not an `` and '' . 
  typical of your tendency towards hysteria/paranoia when it comes to reading comprehension . 
  how have i questioned you ? 
  i have merely asked if , in your estimation , different standards of truth should be applied to pro-israeli or questioning-of-israel sources ( with the pro-israeli standards being * significantly * less stringent , of course ) ? 
  i have now asked this simple , yes or no , question three times , yet you are still to answer , preferring to divert the discussion to imaginary accusations instead . 
  might we all just assume what the answer is from your refusal to provide it at this point ? 
  it is because to americans garish colours are more appealing . 
  as you can see above , they are triggered by being questioned about it , refusing to acknowledge it is not perfectly normal . 
  naturally coloured cheese is typically considered `` boring '' and `` not awesome '' by most americans in consumer studies ; it * is * eaten , but exclusively by first-generation immigrants and hipsters . 
  naturally coloured cheese is not available outside specialist shops ( `` cheese stores '' ) , and these are found almost exclusively in major cities . 
  if you do n't want your cheese either orange or in a can , and you are not in nyc , la or chicago , the internet is your best best . 
  edit : i only mean wrong when judged by the cultural norms of civilised nations , not wrong in an absolute sense - if you guys * like * orange freakcheese , well then you guys * eat * orange freakcheese !, 
   do different standards apply to pro-palestinian/peace sources and pro-israeli ? 
  how is that not asking the question straight ? 
   is it that the same standards do not [ ... ] apply when one is criticising the palestinians as when one is questioning israel 's activities ? 
  again , that seems pretty direct to me . 
  they were the first two times i asked ; the third was :, 
   i have merely asked if , in your estimation , different standards of truth should be applied to pro-israeli or questioning-of-israel sources ? 
  yet again , is that not perfectly clear in what is being asked ?
