  the aircraft closest to the camera is the wing commander 's personal aircraft , as may be seen by the diagonal brown stripes aft of the engine nacelles . 
  i think the recovery that the former yugoslavia has undergone is absolutely amazing , in every way including repaired community relations . 
  living in australia i know a lot of croats and bosniaks who came here as refugees in the '90s as well as some serbs , and there is no noticeable hatred between any of them . 
  i do n't think there is that much general lingering resentment , but ( as a foreigner ) i definitely noticed some scars that had n't healed - the most visible being the vandalised road signs i mentioned before , which were everywhere in the border regions between bosniak bosnia ( is that just bosnia ? ), 
  and republika srpska . 
  nearly every sign in fact . 
  however , that only proves that there is at least one bitter , angry little man out there ; not that the population as a whole thinks that way . 
  my cousins and i have barely discussed the war tbh , and in bih and croatia i noticed plenty of serb license plates and etc. 
  traces of the past do linger and will for some considerable time to come i am sure . 
  aside from anything the trials are still ongoing in the hague , and new burial sites are still being discovered around srebrenica and places like that . 
  people have definitely moved on , but the memories are not that far under the surface . 
  however , it 's great to hear your attitude and i 'd like to think ( actually do believe ) you properly represent * most * yugoslav people 's views these days . 
  oh , so you 're blaming the croats for holding a grudge , are you ? 
  jk man , honestly , i meant no offence or nothing at all really of that crack - it was just a joke ( in self-admitted poor taste what 's more ... ) . 
  that said , it is quite remarkable ( and very admirable ) , given how relatively recent the latest conflict was and how long the entire history of that conflict is overall , that your worst experience has been so very mild !, 
  i really am very happy to hear that your experiences have been so devoid of bitterness and bigotry man , it really is brilliant . 
  people in croatia ( which i know best ) have a great attitude towards getting on with life and working hard to make the best of things , something i realise from my family interactions , but also just looking around while i 'm there . 
  for example , greece if * full * of empty and abandoned factories and the like , while in croatia everywhere there are people doing things and working to improve their lives . 
  ( no slur on the greeks , obviously they 've had a tough time recently and i really like greece/the greeks too ; the croats - and other former yugoslavs - just seem to have a more positive outlook is all i mean to say . ), 
  i have not yet been to serbia , but i really love croatia and bih and enjoy my holidays there more than perhaps * anywhere * else i have been . 
  now , obviously that 's a hard call to make , but overall i can not fault any experience i have had in the former yugoslavia and really enjoy the region 's natural beauty , diversity and the people 's warm and welcoming nature - i really do feel it 's my favourite place to holiday as much as any one location can be ... 
  in fact i 'm back there in september ( 2 months almost to the day before i fly ) , mainly to the dalmatian coast where i have family ties , but also visiting sarajevo and banja luka this time ( only having been to mostar in bih before ) which i am * really * looking forward to . 
  i ca n't wait to be back in the balkans , i really ca n't . 
  tsigan = gypsy ( romani ) ? 
  edit : this is just a question , i do n't know what tsigan means ... could someone please provide a good translation ? 
  1/4 each - is that cumulatively additive , or fractional then ? 
  like , does two 1/4s make us 1/2 mortal enemies , or a 1/4 of a 1/4 ( 1/16 ) mortal enemies ? 
  why not just be friends anyway ? 
  a quick glance at your history reveals we have at least one shared interest , so we could at least pass the peace pipe while we do that mortal enemy maths and see how that changes the equation !, 
  it was a pretty awful war . 
  my cousins all come from the dalmatian coast/islands originally ( though some now live in zagreb for work ) , which were happily largely untouched ( they remember jets flying over and hiding from them occasionally , but there was relatively little actual violence - although some streets in split are pretty pockmarked with the holes of what must have been heavy-machinegun rounds , judging from their size ) so they do n't really carry a noticeable chip on their shoulders , but yeah , i bet among a lot of people the memories are still vert fresh . 
  my bosniak mates here in australia have never once said anything derogatory about serbs or croats in my hearing , though some served in the bosnian ( muslim ) army against the bosnian serbs when they were just kids themselves , but i think to a large extent that is because they consciously decided to leave the past behind them and live in the now over here . 
  what 's good to see though is that the younger generations seem to be avoiding the contagion of hate and resentment quite successfully and the region as a whole is slowly growing more prosperous and stable - two things that contribute to improved relations probably more than any other single factor , including time by itself . 
  are you in the states , over here ( australia ) or somewhere in europe ? 
  over here i honestly just do n't hear it , but then among your in-laws the discussion is driven by a different , immediate family , dynamic than my conversations with friends here or cousins on holiday ... 
  this has been pounced on and heavily downvoted already ( after just 10m ) by the pro-israeli thought police - an interesting reaction given that they claim there is * nothing wrong * with settlement expansion . 
  if there 's nothing wrong with it , if this is n't a racist policy , then why not let people read about it ? 
  why not be proud of the government 's actions if you agree with the policies , and believe in their moral probity ? 
  if not thought policing , then how would you describe efforts to influence which stories get either buried or promoted ? 
  i mean , in a literal sense it is a direct effort to police which stories get through to `` rising '' and ultimately the frontpage . 
  well , it seems the pro-peace lobby to which i owe allegiance is actually pulling ahead slowly on this one now - when i commented the thought police ( to use the term you just approved of ) had it at 0 points and < 50 % upvoted , but right now it 's at 3 points and 60 % upvoted . 
  of course none of that changes the fact that team israel * tried * to smother it at birth , which is all i was commenting on . 
  so what i was talking about is not * just * that `` reddit drama '' ( whatever that means exactly ) which seems to upset you so , but an actual commentary on different moral philosophies regarding freedom of speech and expression . 
  personally , i believe that while innocent palestinians and israel civilians are dying nobody is really winning . 
  accordingly i do n't see this vicious provocation as helping either side `` win '' , and therefore i do n't view stifling the discussion which , combined with other such discussions and over time might hopefully lead to such policies being reconsidered under the weight of the international community 's condemnation ( eg sanctions , plus , perhaps , other more stringent diplomatic measures being imposed - for israel 's own good , of course , given that the nation 's leadership seems utterly incapable by itself of seeing anything beyond its petty , immediate goals ) as a `` win '' for israel and its ideologue proponents either . 
  so despite what such people , in their ignorant bigotry , may think of as themselves winning , a more balanced , more considered perspective reveals that the word/concept is not just meaningless , but is actually self-defeating for those who would `` fight for israel '' . 
  ^ ^ on ^ ^ the ^ ^ internet , ^ ^ lol . 
  does * that * address what you 're talking about ? 
  if not , i am sorry , but you 'll have to start being a little less cryptic and talk about concepts we * all * understand . 
  edit : btw there were not four comments when i posted mine ; there were none . 
  i was purely discussing the efforts to bury this story . 
   the israelis are the natives, 
  only a small proportion of israel 's population though , ie the descendants of the pre-first-aaliyah yeshiva , and of course the arabs . 
  yeah , but the settlement issue is more complex than just booting them all off that palestinian land , unfortunately . 
  many of the settlers are active religious-nationalist zealots who would actively and violently resist any attempt to move them off the land they 're squatting on by the israeli government ; remember , these people 's definition of morality is very different to the post-renaissance , post-enlightenment western conception ... 
  i mean , these people literally believe that because some ancestor of theirs may or may not have lived somewhere in the west bank region at some point in the past at least *** 2,000 years ago *** they have more right to the land than the indigenous palestinians !, 
  crazy , i know , but they * will not * be swayed from that belief , despite the fact the historical kingdom of israel lasted only from ca 1000 bc - 730 bc ( outside of which the region was ruled by others - egyptians , philistines , hellenes , romans - and that 's even before their ancestors left , with more empires still having ruled since ! ), 
  and that the bulk of the jewish people abrogated any connection with the land by splitting for *** 2,000 years *** without making , or even thinking about making in any practical sense , * any * attempt to return until the late-19th century when a german ( jew ) called theodr herzl , inspired by the pan-germanism then sweeping his native land which ultimately led to the formation of a unified germany ( and we all know how * that * ended up !, 
  ) , wrote a tract called * der judenstaat * which mooted the idea of a jewish nation , united and living in an ethnically cleansed community . 
  herzl chose palestine due purely to the mythical , biblical antecedents ( despite their irrelevance ) and that is , pretty much directly , how we arrive at the current mess , with israel not only having been violently hacked from its indigenous population 's control , but what remains of palestine being violently settled in the last vestige of actual active colonialism ( an act of racially motivated violence in and of itself , eschewed by all the world 's civilised nations between the end of wwii and now ) seen in the world today . 
  it 's as brutal , racist and amoral as colonialism ever was , only these `` modern '' israelis do n't even have the excuse of it being the accepted way of doing things in their era that the europeans of times past can at least hold up as some semblance of their having morals . 
  it 's all quite dreadful , but that is unfortunately the situation as it stands . 
  of course one can entirely empathise with the jewish desire for a homeland , but surely they can let go of the primitivistic tribalism that drives the zionist ideology and just learn to * share * the land with its indigenous peoples ? 
  israel is and should remain , but they really could start acting like moral human beings in the occupied territories and end the violence , the apartheid and the squatting you refer to in the west bank . 
  until then i fear we will never see peace ; it is not in the gift of the palestinians to bestow , but must come from the israelis accepting that the palestinians are people just like them , no more of less `` valuable '' . 
  just other people , who have the same essential , natural human rights as the israelis - something the israelis are bizarrely and unconscionably reluctant to do . 
  huh ? 
  you 've lost me mate ... 
  there are a * few * fairly relatively recently immigrated arabs among the palestinians , but genetic studies have proven most palestinians are indigenous to the region , with specifically levantine genetic markers similar to cretans and jews ( who both originated in the area , although of course most of the jews chose not to live in the levant for *** 2,000 years *** , unlike their palestinian/cretan levantine genetic cousins ) . 
  the thing is there 's a difference between cultural arabs ( who speak arabic and may , or may not , share common cultural artefacts such as cuisine - eg falafel , hummus , kebabs , etc - or dress , with other arab groups , but are ethnically distinct from arabs from the arabian peninsula ) and arab arabs ( for want of a better term ) who actually have their ancestral origins in the arabian peninsula ( eg the saudis , yemenis , omanis and etc ) . 
  consider the differences between the moroccans , egyptians , lebanese , saudis , yemenis and iranian arabs : all `` arabs '' ( culturally ) , but all with their own distinct cultures and ethnicities !, 
  it would be very bigoted and ignorant to try the old racist favourite `` they all look the same to me '' with such diverse groups !, 
  palestinians are * culturally * arabs , but ethnically levantine , so if by `` arabs '' you mean `` palestinians '' then i really do not see where you expect them to go ? 
  surely if anyone should `` go home '' it is the much more recent european jewish arrivistes , if they ca n't learn some manners and how to share at least ? 
  of course palestine/israel is part of the levant ; that my friend is simple geography . 
  you can change fact to fiction in your own mind , but it does not impact on reality in the slightest . 
  sorry , but that 's life . 
  genetic links to a region do not have any bearing on land title , but they do demonstrate which people are indigenous . 
  the palestinians are equally native to palestine and israel as are the jews ; however , the jews left for *** 2,000 years *** , abrogating their physical , moral and legal connection to the land and keeping only some amorphous `` spiritual connection '' ( saying a prayer once a year in no way compares to living on and working the land for generation after generation after generation , obviously enough ... ) that bears very little meaning outside the confused minds of religious zealots . 
  judaic law may state what it likes . 
  it is subservient to international law , except strictly within the theocratic confines of israel proper . 
  the judaic primogeniture connection between the non-pre-first-aaliyah-yishuv jews and palestine is obviously completely and irrevocably broken - it is completely undocumented , indeed undocumentable , given the land was surrendered by the jews of the ad '70s following their defiance of their roman masters ' law which led to their banishment after many instances of disruptive behaviour and hubristic revolts , refusals to pay the fair and reasonable taxes required for the * pax romana * and so on . 
  there is no need for the palestinians , who are - genetic studies prove - the direct descendants of those inhabitants of the region who stayed , to hearken back to a misty , ancient past for their right to the land - they lived and worked it until only *** 70 years ago *** when the zionists declared `` independence '' and usurped the indigenous population in a war of aggression with no legal justification , preluded by an horrific terrorist campaign aimed at provoking inter-mural conflict and stabbing the british in the back - despite , let 's not forget , the british having made the balfour declaration ( which lies at the root of so much me conflict to this day ) then facilitated jewish immigration and zionist proto-colonialism for many years until the exigencies of the need to literally ** defeat the nazis ** forced limits on jewish immigration ( temporarily ) , at which point the zionists literally threw a temper tantrum , starting a campaign of terrorist violence ( the beginnings of modern , organised , political terrorism in the me that is probably the singular most clear impact israel has had upon the modern political landscape , as the zionist example has clearly encouraged other groups to engage in terrorism following the zionist model ) and illegal immigration that was designed to cause mayhem , destabilising the region and making the british remove themselves and their restraining influence from the palestine . 
  at this point the zionists committed the nakbah atrocities and unilaterally declared israel a state . 
  any judaic primogeniture in israel * can only * begin then ; however , it is not on stable legal or moral ground , given that the land was stolen in '48 anyway . 
  the un proposal was only a proposal , not law , not finalised and not agreed by both parties . 
  it is a foundation of sand . 
  of course , the ongoing occupation - read colonisation and apartheid - in the west bank is orders of magnitude worse and not merely of dubious legal provenance , but absolutely , inarguably illegal under international law . 
  i doubt they will ever `` forget '' kosovo . 
  certainly not in less than two decades . 
  not to worry , the american empire will be along shortly . 
  they 're missile bays , the missiles inside swing out on arms . 
  the doors are opened to fire , otherwise they remain closed to reduce radar returns . 
  that was cool , thx for sharing . 
  it 'll be great when she 's flying again . 
   the final version of the bill was watered down to remove a clause that would have required lobbyists for ngos affected by the new rules to wear special name tags during visits to the legislature . 
  at least they have delayed the introduction of green crescent badges . 
  that 's something . 
  mart, 
  well a computer scientist is entirely different to a programmer and even less closely related to an it person , doing support and networking type stuff .
