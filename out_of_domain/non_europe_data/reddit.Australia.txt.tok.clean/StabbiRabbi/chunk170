  head anywhere else than queensland . 
  literally anywhere . 
  plus as a diesel mechanic you would be fucked for work there these days ( same as wa , which is otherwise a great place and a looooong way from queensland to boot ! ), 
  due to the mining downturn . 
  bending bananas does n't require diesel machinery . 
  lucky for the dog you 're not in korea . 
  followed by this gem just below :, 
   the nazis are an amazing group , they are human nature on a massive scale , they truly thought they were saving germany and that state of mind , it 's almost sort of admirable in a morbid sort of way . 
  smh . 
  that 's not just australia though , that 's * all * the civilised anglophone nations that say aluminium instead of aluminum ... 
  if you think about it alumin * ium * is correct for an elemental name , or do you say uranum , plutonum and etc. . . ? 
  maybe he could n't understand your accents and thought you said `` roast dinner '' instead of chips ? 
  the chups = chips translation is pretty well understood by most aussies , but some kiwi accents are thicker than others , making * some * of you guys nigh on unintelligible . 
  i 'm from wa and whilst it is possible to buy chips and gravy here , most people prefer vinegar or kebab meat and sauces ( the classic aussie hsp ) . 
  can tell that from your username . 
  fush ha ha . 
  very kiwi . 
  the irish actually gave safe haven to a number of high-ranking nazis post-wwii and even had ties to germany during wwii . 
  famously [ otto skorzeny ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1538969/ireland-welcomed-hitlers-henchmen.html ) found shelter in the republic of eire for many years , but he was not alone . 
  not entirely * that * surprising then ... 
  [ one of us , one of us ... ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsomp4mp79gx6cnfhweoh84glklebcneirir2hjqbzfaxuxd8f-zyczhp6c ), 
  that 's true , but people i know who import goods go to china and check themselves ; any customer here can do that regardless of what the government does or does n't do for them about it . 
  i guess the difference is the guys i 'm talking about have to on sell their goods , while john holland were `` just '' installing what they buy in the fucking children 's hospital ... 
  it 's incredible , is n't it ? 
  and they do n't plan on retiring them until ** 2040 ** !, 
  the usn does n't get that kind of lifespan from its * ships * ... 
  that would have been awesome . 
  they are amazing aircraft to see in flight . 
  i 'm totes jelly ha ha , i only get to see them at airshows and even then not often ( i live in aus where they only visit occasionally ) . 
  taking * ` off ' , not ` of ' , of course . 
  the fullback is an awesome jet - massive payload and range , excellent avionics and even rest facilities for the crew ( a little toilet , heating element and space to lie down for long flights ... ) . 
  is that shopped ? 
  in any case , the parallels are obvious to see . 
  bird of prey indeed - i would not like to be the guy hiding from a b-2a strike any more than a mouse from a peregrine falcon !, 
  i bet la and mobile , alabama are literally the only two places he 's * ever * been . 
  like if la and al are * that * different , imagine how different nyc would be !!!, 
  * another * `` totally different dialect '' , different cuisine ( i mean ny pizza is to mobile pizza as real pizza is to that italian crap ! ) . 
  and what about chicago ? 
  omg . 
  literally their own different pizza again , almost unrecognisable from nyc pizza , but still incomparably better that that italian crap . 
  of course . 
  so yeah , my money 's on this guy actually * underestimating * the usa 's diversity because he 's only been to two cities within it . 
  of course , despite that , he * knows * stupid europoors could n't even understand that kind of diversity , french people and germans are both all white dudes , and they live like right next door to each other !, 
  and the cheese is all orange . 
  or comes in cans ... 
  idk how they do it . 
  i 've walked through a b-52 bomb bay and you have to duck to enter . 
  the height you see is the height they are . 
  i guess the bomb trucks are low enough . 
  wait . 
  can we comment in the linked op for this one , seeing as it 's within the sub , or is that still a violation of the `` look , but do n't touch principle '' ? 
  it 's very , very tempting to sally forth to do battle with this clown , but this whole thing is too inceptionesque to figure out if that 's cool or not ... 
  small , furry animal . 
  not in france ; they have massive monuments at places like villiers-bretineux where the australians kicked the germans all over the battlefield and the villagers still celebrate their connexion with australia to this day . 
  less celebrated , but equally deserving , are perhaps are events such as the australian light horse cavalry regiments undertaking the last sabres-drawn and levelled cavalry charge in history at beersheeba and capturing palestine from the ottomans , or some of the wwii efforts in south-east asia , the mena theatre and raaf aircrew flying in the eto . 
  i bet it complements his fedora to a tee . 
  what a fantastic skill to have , being able to knot your tie like a twat . 
  well , it 's also easy enough to simply change the `` np . '', 
  to `` www . '', 
  which would have the same effect . 
  i actually already commented in the original thread , in a completely unrelated sub-thread so i know exactly where to find it . 
  doing so follows the letter of the law ( rules ) , but not the principle/intent of them ; though , as i asked before , does that apply within the sub ? 
  the point is to not ruin other people 's subs which clearly commenting on a thread within this sub is n't going to do . 
  one technical point is that if you do interfere in `` np . '', 
  linked threads reddit * allegedly * tracks that and it can result in bans and so on . 
  however , as we both discussed , that 's easy enough to avoid in practice , if not ethically . 
  ah ok , it seems i was fed some propaganda ha ha . 
  that was why i included the precautionary `` allegedly '' , just in case i had been lied to ... 
  i swear somebody , somewhere on reddit claimed any activity on `` np . '', 
  links could be tracked , but it looks like that claim was bs . 
  how strange to find something untrue on the internet !, 
  it looks cool how they 're the same colour , but such different sizes . 
  i always wanted to get a black and tan miniature dachshund to go with my big old rottie ( now sadly passed ) because it would look so funny , the big dog and the tiny one both with the same colours even down to the eyebrows . 
  upvote for vegemite master race !, 
  at work , wearing my [ rolex explorer ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/ws89cl8e1xktw3a/photo%2019-07-2016%2c%2012%2031%2027%20pm.jpg?dl=0 ) . 
  yep , union thugs gon na be out there thugging . 
  it 's , like , their thing . 
  i had thought my meaning was sufficiently clear in that this is an * early prototype * in which jet engines had not been fitted yet * within the context of the program * , not this particular airframe . 
  to be absolutely precise this is in fact an horton h.v , not any one of the actual ho 229 prototypes proper . 
  the first ho 229 ( v1 ) prototype ( actually designated the h.ix v1 to be precise ) evolved from this flying wing design , but was a glider . 
  the next aircraft built in the program series was designated the h.ix v2 and * did * have two junkers jumo 004 engines installed ( the aircraft was intended to fly with the bmw 003 , but it was unavailable so the horten brothers made do with the jumos , as used by the me 262 ) with which it flew . 
  subsequently the third prototype was the first to actually be designated as the ho 229 ( v3 ) , or , according to some sources , the goetha go 229 ; no more prototypes were completed before the factories were overrun and the war ended . 
  this is all very interesting ; however it would not fit in the title box when posting ; ergo , i decided to go with `` ho 229 early prototype '' as a way of conveying what the aircraft was , rather than its precise designation and the airframe 's exact history . 
  sources :, 
  edit : tidied it up to remove a slightly snappy tone i noticed , but had not intended . 
  i should probably have included this information when i first posted and perhaps worded the title slightly differently so thanks to both u/researcheratlarge and u / _ elbee _ for bringing my attention to any ambiguity . 
   used to demonize the israeli legal system despite it being utterly reasonable . 
  well , kind of reasonable for certain people , but not all , and depending on whether your personal definition of reason is rooted in biblical or post-enlightenment era morality and thought , but sure , with those caveats your statement is * pretty close * to the truth of the matter . 
  to get it over the line properly might i suggest you just swap out `` demonise '' for `` report on in a balanced manner according to modern mores and morals '' , or something similar perhaps ? 
  with all due respect , and as i explained above , this * is * an early prototype of the ho 229 as per the title , just a very early one in the program . 
  to me it seems scarcely worth reposting now , or to start posting pictures of the ho 229 v3 instead for that matter , as it will simply serve to fill the sub with content we 've now all already seen despite there now being no risk of confusion . 
  personally , i do n't feel that the picture is any less interesting because it describes what the aircraft * is * as opposed to what it was * called * . 
  there is also a wealth of extra information on the program and all of the aircraft built during its course of development in the links i provided . 
  edit : also edited to make sure i did n't come across as being snippy - that was not my intention with either commenter and i am happy to acknowledge the phrasing of the title could have been clearer . 
  nonetheless i do not feel it detracts from the photo 's interest , as i mentioned above , and so have left it . 
  here is another source , with 25 photos of the smithsonian 's captured ho 229 v3 for anyone interested in more information on top of the other sources above : https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/horten-ho-229-v3, 
  this is a lovely dram , one of my favourites . 
  the 21yo is another big step up again , and the 25yo just blows me away . 
  you 're lucky you have your first taste of them to look forward to ; nothing like the first time !, 
  nowadays they use we , the customers , who have to slave away putting it together ourselves ...
