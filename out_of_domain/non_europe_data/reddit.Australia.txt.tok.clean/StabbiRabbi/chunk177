  i paid around that for a replacement in dec ' 14 ... ** but ** , it was an emergency job from australia house in london , which they had to me two days later . 
  a regular renewal is about half that amount though . 
  i must admit idk if it costs more to get a first passport though . 
  honestly , i can not imagine not having a passport . 
  in fact , i have two ( uk & aussie ) , both of which i keep current . 
  actually , in australia we spell it * americani *** s *** ation * thank you very much !, 
  i 'm a big fan of the big sherry scotches , and particularly fond of this distillery and glengoyne . 
  i 'm very happy to have about 2/3 of a bottle of this left , as it is bloody hard to find now . 
   european military actually have less utility for such long range range weapons because they do n't have the same data link , stealth or aew&c assets as the americans . 
  apart from stealth , which is changing as the f-35 propagates , this is n't quite fair . 
  britain , france and nato ( in europe ) all operate e-3 sentry awacs aircraft , while other countries have their own solutions too ( eg the saab eyrie ) . 
  link-16 is a requirement for the air forces of all nato countries iirc , and if not absolutely everywhere , it is very common . 
  the f-22a 's madl is not operated by european forces , although even within the usaf on the f-22a can share data over madl right now anyway ( although that is changing with the pods currently under test on f-15cs ) . 
  the greatest impediment to the use of extreme long-range bvr a2a missiles is sufficiently permissive roes that allow their employment , and that is a problem shared as equally by the us military as it is by europe 's forces . 
  one other point is that hellfire and brimstone are employed very differently , with brimstone being carried by fast-jets ( tornado , eurofighter typhoon and tested on hornets/super hornets by the usn ) , while hellfire is only carried by attack helicopters , slower-moving coin aircraft such as the cessna combat caravan , the most recent gunship versions of the c-130j ( eg usmc harvest hawk kc-130js ) and soon the lcs . 
  the uk carries hellfires on its apaches , and it seems that while the missiles serve a similar purpose they are complementary rather than in direct competition . 
  that 's a nice , sultry expression she 's wearing . 
  canadian jsf program ? 
  cool poster , but clearly it failed to sell the concept ... 
  in vietnam there are massive billboards with classic communist style art pictures of vietnamese workers and soldiers standing next to each other , arms outstretched holding their respective tools . 
  however , that is internal propaganda and was observed forty years after the war . 
  during the war one primary form of propaganda was the invitation of journalists from neutral nations to observe the effects of us bombing and other combat , as well as highly-publicised visits by such us celebrities as jane `` hanoi jane '' fonda who was famously photographed wearing a steel helmet , sitting in a pavn aaa gunner 's seat with barrels pointed skywards . 
  her campaign certainly seems to have been much better managed than rudd 's over a far greater period of time . 
  if it 's a choice between supporting a kiwi and supporting someone who proven himself incapable of effective leadership , then clark would get my nod too . 
  oh yeah , it would not have stayed airborne long even without the jug 's interference in its flight . 
  i guess the difference is following this it landed in multiple pieces rather than complete . 
  the photo 's attribution claims this as a shoot down fwiw . 
  i think a * fair * cost is dependent on how much you want/need it , but the regular price for renewal is aud $ 254 for an adult 's 10yr passport . 
  a 5yr passport can be had for less , and there 's a different schedule for kids . 
  here 's the relevant www.passports.gov.au listing anyway : https://www.passports.gov.au/pages/fees.aspx, 
  a glance at that seems to indicate your daughter could get her kids sorted for $ 127 ea , gaining them each a 5yr passport . 
  kind of . 
  brimstone is only being investigated for use on helicopters , ships and etc at the moment , as these were not its intended use , which was always fast jets . 
  the british still use hellfires , while the expansion of brimstone 's platforms/use cases seems to have followed on from operational experience with the missile over afghanistan/libya/iraq . 
  hellfire is , otoh , not suitable for employment by fast jets , only the slower platforms i mentioned and jagm is intended to replace hellfire primarily , with maverick replacement only planned for late in the program ( 3rd stage ) and only for the usmc at this stage ( though of course plans may have evolved , scope creep being the perennial acquisition problem ... ) : http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/joint-common-missile-program-fired-but-not-forgotten-0229/, 
  the sdbii is certainly an analogue for brimstone , in terms of role and seeker capability at least , though . 
  mine too , a very powerful aircraft with long legs and a superb combat record in all theatres of the war & many different roles , even after the mosquitos bested it in some terms it was still a very useful bit of kit . 
  and yeah , i think they look fantastic too . 
  well , this was in nevada , but i 'm sure they * were * hitting empty desert . 
  the air breathing ramjet means the meteor has better fuel management abilities , allowing it to cruise efficiently over distance , but then gain a burst of energy in the terminal mavouevering phase . 
  the meteor is also more modern , and its designers would certainly have taken the concerns regarding the ability of russian ecm/ew equipment to `` fry '' the amraam 's seeker into consideration when designing the meteor ; remember all its customers have been amraam operators and will still hold amraam stocks for some time to come even after full introduction of the meteor into service . 
  however , the amraam 's manufacturing/design team will not have ignored this issue either and have no doubt also addressed it also . 
  the true range and exact capabilities of neither the aim-120d nor the meteor can be known exactly from publicly available data though , so , as has been said , this is all `` to the best of our knowledge '' type stuff . 
  http://i.imgur.com/747s1kv.jpg - not sure where it was found or the res , but it 's much better than 830 x 554 . 
  actually , your source fails to contradict any of what i have already explained . 
  brimstone 's improvement on hellfire was that it took the same fire-and-forget mmw seeker capability , but gave in an application from fast strike aircraft . 
  the agm-65g also uses a mmw seeker in the same way , giving similar capabilities albeit in a far bulkier package . 
  when you talk about `` fixed-wing aircraft '' you need to consider that there is a difference between the launch parameters of a harvest hawk vs a f-35 . 
  brimstone may end up as a direct replacement , but currently the raf uses brimstone while the british army uses hellfire , with no plans apparent to integrate brimstone until the british guardians are delivered , and even then no definite plans . 
  anyway , you are quite free to still disagree ; it really is no skin off my nose , especially as i have found the conversation interesting anyway . 
  edit for clarity . 
  whoo ... oh , forget it . 
  yes . 
  they are rose hip . 
  very good observation skills . 
  the british wah-64as were constantly deployed to afghanistan as part of op herrick , where they fired a great number of hellfires . 
  at the moment mbda have only just proposed brimstone 2 for britains apache guardian fleet , and it was first announced this month . 
  of course i am sure it was always a hope of mbda , but it is by no means a done deal . 
  here 's a janes article which goes into a little more detail : http://www.janes.com/article/62501/mbda-proposes-brimstone-derivative-for-future-uk-apache-ah-64e, 
  it 's partly an internet thing , and on reddit i think it mainly comes from the more immature users ( not necessarily in terms of age either , but rather mentality ) . 
  some people just do n't handle any kind of disagreement well , seeing it as a personal affront for whatever reason no matter what the context though . 
  generally , imo , it 's not worth arguing with these types , let alone worrying yourself why they 're so vehement . 
  in terms of such encounters on reddit you be quite sure that most would n't be quite so quick to jump down your throat irl . 
  i bet every allied pilot 's first reaction was `` what the % # ! \u00a5 was * that * thing !!! '', 
  the pilot was lucky to get the gun camera footage , or people might well not have even believed his description of it when he got back . 
  it certainly was a revolutionary plane , if not as combat effective as its designers must have hoped . 
  more information about the usaf weapon school deliberate strike night , which this photo was taken during :, 
   `` dsn is a large force exercise in the weapons school advanced integration phase involving in excess of 70 aircraft and joint department of defense assets ( from three services ) against a realistic near peer adversary , '' said lt. col. daniel s. hoadley , 325th weapons squadron commander . 
  `` it 's a graduation level exercise for usafws students . 
  it is the u. s. air force 's premier training event focused on attacking an integrated air defense system . '', 
   dsn reflects the degree of cutting-edge training provided by the advanced integration portion of the weapons school curriculum by testing stealth and conventional airframes ' abilities to conduct attacks during the hours after sunset .

  not exactly , but it was taken while the aircraft was operating in support of the iraqi northern no-fly zone ( north of the 36 degree parallel , preventing iraqi air and ground incursions against the kurds ) which puts it between '91 ( start of nfz ) and '98 ( when the ravens were retired ) . 
  best i can do , sorry . 
  actions pls , not just words . 
  it is not known from real experience , but the us military has been discussing concerns that drfm jamming may mean that multiple amraams will be required to hit enemy aircraft . 
  this has been the topic of much discussion and is what i was referring to , eg :, 
  it is to these concerns that i refer . 
  edit : letter, 
  no worries . 
  seconded . 
  there was a particular brand of fajita mix powder my dad used to bring back from trips to the states . 
  it 's not available any more though . 
  it 's funny you say that as i pm 'd someone itt who acknowledged that was what he was doing ( though he phrased it differently , referring to his opinions as facts , despite getting severely rekt in here at points by other commenters ) . 
  after that i stopped replying ; if you ca n't have a conversation without mashing downvote when disagreed with then you clearly are absolutely incapable of having a civil conversation . 
  so yes , i quite agree . 
  if people are being jerks/trolling then downvote away imo , but not when people just do n't share your exact point of view !, 
  yeah , i used an ambiguous term , but i also acknowledged that the amraam would have been continuously updated to help cope with such threats . 
  of course there are no official dod documents ; it 's hardly the type of thing that is shared about missiles . 
  that said , i also already acknowledged that my initial post was largely speculative too , though speculation informed by a wide range of reading and information sources including articles with pilots and senior air force personnel quoted . 
  due to the nature of the conversation most people here , with a couple of notable exceptions , are talking speculatively - even your own comments about the d model are rightly qualified with a ` reportedly ' . 
  personally , so long as the speculation is acknowledged , i think it 's acceptable . 
  fixed now sorry . 
  linked articles make that clear despite the typo though . 
  e : another bloody typo here too . 
  should have waited till i was woke up to answer instead of when i was half asleep . 
  let 's not forget the horrors of the cultural revolution . 
  that was pretty fucking inglorious , and well within living memory too . 
  oh yeah , i love yarg too . 
  it 's a lovely cheese , just as you describe .
