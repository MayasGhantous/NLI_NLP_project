  when you say the rind , do you mean the nettle wrapping ? 
  i always cut it off too . . 
  rhyming with another suggestion , but completely unrelated , is [ pag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pag_cheese ) ( pronounced * parg * ) , a sheep 's milk from the island of pag in dalmatia . 
  it 's a hard cheese , the flavour of which changes as it matures . 
  i 've tended to eat the younger , creamier pag cheeses , but the spicier , brown more mature pag is good too . 
  for soft cheese , i enjoy the norman [ le coutances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coutances_cheese ) and [ pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pont-l%27%c3%89v%c3%aaque_cheese ) cheeses , though i would caution against aging the pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque too much as it acquires a * very * strong , quite ammonia influenced , taste if left too long . 
  edit : and for another soft cheese , the double cream [ b\u00fbche d'affinois ] ( http://www.aoap.com.au/content_common/pr-white-mould-cheese_guilloteau-buche-daffinois.seo ) is also quite lovely too . 
  i 've not had the norwegian cheese , but no , i would n't describe it a caramel flavour . 
  it just browns as it ages . 
  i have some norwegian family friends , here in in australia , whom i may ask . 
  i 'll check it out - cheers for the tip . 
  i added one more cheese to my list above too - another creamy french one . 
  still think the yarg and the pag are the best suggestions though . 
  that 's his shirt sleeve , is n't it ? 
  just less neatly arranged than on his left . 
  love those freckles . 
  so in your house it 's actually * black is the new orange * ?

  the history and the sheer diversity . 
  compared to highly homogeneous cultures , such as the us , europe is amazing . 
  within those cultures is contained an amazing panapoly of different history , cuisine , art , architecture and other cultural products . 
  the fact that you can travel such short distances ( relatively , especially for me as an aussie ) and be somewhere so radically different is fantastic . 
  tbf a lot of people have issues with pokemon players acting inappropriately in places of worship or remembrance . 
  there is an article about the kind of behaviour the veterans in video are complaining about at the war memorial in my city ( in australia ) in today 's paper in fact , although our way of handling it was for the council to write to the game devs and ask them to remove game artefacts from these places and not some redneck rumble in the park . 
  on that note i have to say these pokemon players were just as ridiculous and obnoxious as the vets too . 
  the whole thing is very americana though , so lol . 
  pretty good , but bibi accepted way to easily - he should have held out for more for a while , like the real bibi did . 
  dae think it would be a nice gesture for israel to fund the painting of a massive mural to the principles of love , peace and brotherhood extended to their former palestinian victims on the west wall of the dome of the rock ? 
  of course it would have to be accompanied by the necessary legal provisions and troop/settler withdrawals , but something along those lines should have been made a precondition for even $ 1 of aid . 
  that 's just my opinion of course and others may hold other subjective viewpoints . 
  that 's great , but i think at this point some serious measure need to be considered to make peace a reality . 
  personally i think we have already long passed that point . 
  actually , isis have n't made any position on the environment public , but i can not believe it is france 's efforts to reduce pollution that have caused the recent wave of terrorism . 
  there have always been inter-mural conflicts within france , where little effort has been made , or at least little success achieved , with the integration of north african immigrants into french society . 
  remember , [ the paris massacre ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_massacre_of_1961 ) , in which hundreds of algerian-french citizens were killed in the streets , was only 55yrs ago . 
  many french citizens of north african ancestry live in grinding poverty , effectively segregated into ghettoes . 
  it is little wonder isis 's message finds fertile soil in these communities , even without the current conflicts riddling the entire mena region .

  clearly you have these statistics at your fingertips : personally , i would put them into a spreadsheet and confront her with it . 
  oh no , i got enough downvotes last time i said it ; i 'm not repeating it for your elucidation .

  sigh ... unzips . 
  gibbon is scarcely just `` one historian '' , in the context of the roman empire at least !, 
  i think most people with an interest are at least aware of his role in the historiography of the empire and his classic work , * the decline and fall of the roman empire * . 
  that aside , these emperors in many ways represent the peak of the empire . 
  it 's interesting that machiavelli includes titus , who with his father vespasian effectively created the conditions which enabled the `` five good emperors ' '' reigns : i can only assume he is not * always * included because his brother , domitian ( who is a far less universally admired figure due to elements of megalomania/paranoia in his character which led to proscriptions and a resurgence in informers not seen since nero 's day , although he did rule the empire effectively nonetheless ) comes between him and nerva , meaning he is not part of the contiguous block . 
  likewise , vespasian ( the first of the flavians ) was also an excellent emperor on a par with the `` five good emperors '' in terms of achievements and rule ; he , however , is not only separated by his sons , but was also involved in the civil war that consumed rome following nero 's death known commonly as the `` year of the four emperors '' ( perhaps * another * historical inspiration for grrm 's asiof `` war of the five kings '' ? 
  known as the seawolves , hal-3 are most famous for their role providing fire support for seal teams in the mekong delta , as well as for the brown water navy as seen here .

  great shot that really shows the actual size of the kc-30a mrtt to advantage - the e-7a is not a small aircraft by any stretch of the imagination either . 
  both of these aircraft represent significant capabilities now possessed by the raaf , with both being among the best types in role available . 
  matched with our * heavily * upgraded f/a -18 a + hornets , f/a -18 f ( + in 12/14 cases ) super hornets , f-35a lightning iis and ea-18g growlers , as well as other isr/istar assets currently being introduced ( eg new uavs , p-8a poseidons and [ isr g550s ] ( http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/the-gulfstream-g550-and-the-adf-plugging-the-isr-gap/ ) ) these types are cornerstones of a modern , network-centric air force which is increasingly modern and capable , especially in regional terms . 
  just the nsa - like every one of us . 
  straight back at ya , china . 
  agreed . 
  despite being personally relative comfortable , it really saddens me to see how the most vulnerable are currently treated in our society and i fully realise that my interests are more closely aligned with theirs than those of the 1 % , who currently seem to be gaining the greatest advantages and advances . 
  the nz welfare scheme seems like a ratfuck of a system to me , and not one i think we should aspire to emulate . 
  whilst i agree with the need for government to rein in spending , slicing bits of the welfare pie is not how i would like to see this done . 
  the social contract * must * work both ways , with people and society both being mutually supportive and both parties both giving and receiving or it will quite simply fail . 
  at the moment i feel that the balance has swung too far from society providing an adequate welfare net and this needs to be fixed , not cemented by following in nz 's heels on this . 
  i would rather the odd welfare cheat manages to enjoy a life of drinking piss and smoking pot from the public pocket than any truly needy members of our society are denied a fair go , or students ' lives made impossible , or a partially disabled person forced into demeaning and unrewarding work . 
  maybe that makes me a sucker , but i do n't think so . 
  ca n't we look for efficiencies from the other side of the equation , as u/kroxigor01 is essentially calling for , and while we 're at it get rid of the parasitic job network private providers ? 
  small government and efficiency is all well and good , but i think the social contract of mutual obligation must override such concepts in areas such as this . 
  \\* edit was for spelling, 
  yes , i too would enjoy successfully shooting between her goalposts , as it were . 
  we 're certainly getting there , with a very balanced range of capabilities that imo puts us on a similar qualitative footing to the raf ( for example ) and pretty near quantitive footing too . 
  in terms of strategic airlift as well , as an example outside those i enumerated above , we are pretty strong with a more than respectable mix of kc-30a , c-17a and c-130j ( supported in the tactical airlift role it plays for the raf by our c-27j fleet , which then free the hercs for other jobs ) ; overall we have an increasingly capable and balanced force , very suitable for our national strategic requirements . 
   i 'd be happy to have a low authority society but i 'd say most of the time when people argue for `` small goverment ( with a society based on personal responsibility ) '' they have been duped . 
  we want less authority , not to shift it from the elected government to an undemocratic oligarchy . 
  or , worse still , a `` self-regulated '' private market that profits from providing services that really should remain within the government 's purview , as per your examples ... 
  nope . 
  neither do i. 
  so ^ no ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ way ... 
  again , that really sows off the sheer size of the kc-30a brilliantly !, 
  it 's great to see people appreciating these vital , but not always properly appreciated , assets . 
  they 're not as glamorous as some of the pointier jets , but , without these types pictured here , those aircraft would be far less capable of performing their roles effectively . 
  it 's been colourised , but there 's no suggestion anywhere that it 's a montage . 
  i suppose it 's * possible * , but then what is n't ? 
  any rotor wash effect would probably be out of frame judging from the relative positions of the banks to the aircraft . 
  the original context is the [ november 1968 edition of the usn 's * all hands * magazine ] ( http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah196811.pdf ) within the article `` a mobile base on the river '' . 
  none of the accompanying operational photos even seem to be staged , but take a look at the magazine as linked and see what you think . 
  that street is * steep * . 
  i thought streets in san francisco were steep , but this is noticeably steeper . 
  we drove up it rather than walking ( as i was dependent on crutches at the time ) , and even the car was struggling at points . 
  it made me wonder if the local driving testers take the candidates they do n't like up there to demonstrate hill parking/starts ... 
  very nice example of a late-model corsair and testament to the type 's longevity and the plethora of roles it performed during its lifetime . 
   `` we should go in and give them a bloody nose like deng xiaoping did to vietnam in 1979 , '', 
  i did n't think the outcome to that particular war was quite so clear cut , with the general consensus seeming to be that neither side conclusively won . 
  this has nothing to do with westerners though - it 's between arabs and israelis , both middle-eastern peoples . 
  that 's what i am hoping for too - a bit like the raf 's global express-based [ sentinal r1 ] ( http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/sentinelr1.cfm ) , which is , i think , a reasonable hope from what information has been released regarding the raaf 's g550s . 
  either that or something along the lines of the rivet joint ... 
  either would be good , both would be better !, 
  i think you hit the nail on the head regarding the relatively few number of customers for the wedgetail : it 's a very expensive capability and there 's still room for growth in the sentry for those who have it . 
  the wedgetail is reportedly the awacs of choice for commanders of all nations involved in what we 're calling op okra over syria/iraq , but the usaf is currently upgrading those of its sentry fleet it intends to keep in service , which is no doubt a more cost-effective route . 
  in any case it 's great we have them and i am very interested to learn more about the g550s . 
  i have no idea , other than to tautologously point out we use the anglicised version because we 're anglophone nations .
