  we always say augustus though , and * julius * caesar , tacitus , scipio * africanus * - shorter names keeping their suffix . 
  otoh , it 's always marc antony too though , so while i 'm sure there must be a rule i ca n't quite work out what it is . 
  same thing in nyc apparently - they really are not appropriate places whatsoever . 
  most definitely - there are plenty of photos of razorback jugs with invasion stripes out three . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the xm-21 / m-21 which consisted of an m134 minigun and seven tube mk40 2.75 '' ffar , though it may be the earlier xm-16 / m-16 which was basically the same , but with two m60s instead of the m134s . 
  there are details and diagrams [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._helicopter_armament_subsystems#uh-1_iroquois ) .

  also , [ 281st ahc website ] ( http://www.281st.com/ ) . 
   the 281st assault helicopter company ( ahc ) `` intruders '' was stationed at nha trang , republic of vietnam 1965-1970 . 
  it was originally attached to the 5th special forces group and was situated inside the special forces operating base ( sfob ) . 
  the 281st ahc was the first us army helicopter company organized and trained as a special operations aviation unit in the republic of vietnam . 
  a combat aviation task force from the unit was attached , as requested , to detachment b-52 , project delta , a special operations augmentation unit that conducted strategic reconnaissance and other clandestine operations throughout the country of south vietnam . 
  this attachment constituted the major mission of the unit and resulted in it being named the us army \u00b4 s first special operations helicopter company . 
  the 281st trained with and supported the military assistance command vietnam ( macv ) recondo training center in nha trang and in its later years provided support for all major commands ( macoms ) within the ii corps tactical zone . 
  it 's available as a free ebook ( s ) now . 
  it is quite old , but still * very * readable . 
  of course , if you 're reading gibbons * decline and fall * , you should also pick up theodor mommsen 's * [ the history of rome ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_rome_ ( mommsen \\ ) ) * , which covers the republic , while gibbons covers the empire . 
  also available as a free ebook too . 
  for modern treatments , tom holland 's * rubicon * ( late-republic ) and * dynasty : the rise and fall of the house of caesar * ( early-empire ) are both very good . 
  when i was young we lived in a house that we subsequently moved out of , but just down the road from and with the old place directly on the route between mine and my best friend 's place ensuring i regularly walked past there . 
  in the old place mum had painted a panda on the back of my bedroom door which i loved dearly . 
  anyway , after a couple of years had passed mum and i went around , knocked on the door and explained who we were . 
  very kindly , the new owners let us have look around our old home , so excitedly i went to look for the panda . 
  well , the lady who had bought the place was very nice about it , but i 'm sure you may imagine my youthful dismay at discovering panda was gone , replaced with a blank door . 
  this was in england , but i now live in australia . 
  however , last christmas we had a family christmas back in the uk , where my sister and her fianc\u00e9e live . 
  while visiting family friends one evening we drove past both these former homes ( being as they 're on the same street ) and the first thing i thought of was * still * the old panda behind the bedroom door . 
  i 'd say cyd charisse , barbara eden and deborah harry . 
  consultancies just view government departments as big , dumb cash cows who they can milk dry , then run away from onto the next one . 
  i used to work in software development consulting and used to feel bad about the way the company 's managers would take the piss ( not in a laughing way , but rather an abuse of responsibility sense ) with government . 
  quite often the department would know it too , but by the time it became apparent their managers had too much personally invested reputation-wise to let the project fail spectacularly as it would if they cut funding so instead they 'd just let it bleed out , or limp along at best . 
  one of the major reasons i quit consulting and moved into product development work . 
  similarly , i ~ ~ am live ~ ~ live in australia where we also drive on the left , right , side of the road . 
  \\* edit : just wanted to make myself sound like a native anglophone ... 
  i really enjoy learning of this kind of discovery and take great pleasure from reading about them . 
  the notion that the further we go into the future , the better we understand the past is really quite encouraging from an humanist perspective imo . 
  interesting cross-reference . 
  i think personally i would rather be in an me-109e rather than such an early curtiss hawk variant , although obviously marseille was a brilliant pilot too and it was n't just the relative merits of the types involved that decided the outcome of that engagement . 
  yeah , she was blondie , just not blonde . 
  eton mess is a great summer dessert , nice and light and fresh . 
  methinks you doth protest too much . 
   hi , it 's deb . 
  you know , when i woke up this morning i had a realization about myself . 
  i was always blondie . 
  people always called me blondie , ever since i was a little kid . 
  quote from her book * no exit * , referenced in her [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debbie_harry ) for easy access . 
  depends on the project and the company , but there are certainly parallels . 
  most of the time with corporate clients the consultancy would be part of a larger project team over which somebody had pretty tight oversight . 
  of course , there are plenty of other ways consultancies milk big companies too ( eg send a team of five , in which only two are worth a damn ; bill full rates for all ... ) and equally there are government departments that have excellent governance ( eg the company i was with did some work for both state and federal ag offices , neither of whom accepted * any * shenanigans !, 
  i think she * did * get snarky about it , until the point she realised it was utterly pointless and stopped gaf . 
  that 's actually the way i read that quote tbh ... 
  my honest and uncensored opinions . 
  sounds like you got to work with one of the good ones ( from both sides of the equation ) , which is so much better for everyone involved ( except greedy consulting firm partners , lol ) . 
  by no means are all government depts useless , nor are the people who work there . 
  it 's just that * some * consulting firms are sharks who see the government as whale calf that got separated from it 's mum . 
  of course , not all consulting firms are like that either , and ymmv from project to project with either party . 
  nonetheless , some shady shit does go down and it 's that with which i wish to have no part . 
  the g550 caew is also definitely used by singapore and , iirc , greece ; there are currently quite a variety of very powerful istar and awacs platforms built around this type of jet . 
  it 's quite an interesting evolution from b707 class airframes down to these business jets , reflecting electronic miniaturisation and reduced crew sizes due to increasing systems automation . 
  are you near the nz army museum , near the big range ? 
  we drove through there at easter when i was in nz , had a look at the museum too . 
  it 's worth the stop , to anyone who finds themselves in the area . 
  we were on our way to wanaka for the airshow , where we stayed in the same lodge as the rnzaf nh90 aircrew/support team , who were all pretty cool . 
  i took quite a few pics of it , might post some up here one day . 
  especially when you consider that in the case of a hot extraction they would sometimes have to just clip themselves on and hang there , for some long distances too . 
  especially if they happened to be in laos when they were pulled out . 
  obviously the helicopter would land to bring them aboard asap , but if they were `` over the fence '' it was sometimes necessary to travel a fairly long way before it would be safe to do so . 
  damn geoblocker , i 'm in australia and it apologises , but claims it ca n't play for me . 
  i live in australia , but i took that picture outside a countdown in upper riccarton , christchurch ( south island for those unfamiliar with the cities of nz ) . 
  [ here 's a reference i found from google too ] ( https://dailyoxford.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/whats-a-trundler/ ) . 
  the kc-97 had a much longer service life than i realised ... 
  not even a bronze medal for this guy in the mental olympics , that 's for sure . 
  that 's a heck of an increase in capability . 
  ava is always lovely . 
  i would love to be the guy rubbing sunscreen on * her * back , though i suppose back then it was tanning oil . 
   a social media user known as professor balthazar posted : `` we have so many girls with ` porn star look ' in tehran . 
  we missed that a real porn star literally came to iran . '', 
  he means girls who dress so you can see their eyes . 
  ah yes , that 's one event i think americans have proved their excellence in time and time again . 
  well , china 's a big place ... 
  not a source i would want to post here , but an interesting discussion of the exact question you are asking : http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/4678/is-the-european-meteor-air-to-air-missile-really-the-best-in-the-world, 
  interesting picture , always nice to see the adf featured , but it 's not often you see a mix of them and iranian weaponry . 
  at least they 're not on the receiving end , those things look like they pack a punch !, 
  yeah , it * really * reminds me of battlefield : vietnam ( the original , not the dlc expansion bf : bc ) , which was a brilliant game . 
  the original context is the [ november 1968 edition of the usn 's * all hands * magazine ] ( http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah196811.pdf ) within the article `` a mobile base on the river '' , though this is colourised . 
  it was interesting reading though . 
   weinberg is heard on the documentary describing at length the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping . 
  `` the moment that the firing started i realized that it was coming from hezbollah . 
  i opened the door of the humvee , * i did n't look at my friends who were sitting on the back seats and * *** i fled *** . '', 
   in the documentary one of the hezbollah narrators says , `` we interviewed the soldier who was injured and who managed to escape but * his capture was not part of the operational order which is why we did n't take him * . '', 
  all israel/hezbollah posturing aside , these two quotes really seem to me to highlight the difficulties a conscript army faces vs an all volunteer force in terms of discipline and motivation , and illustrate exactly why modern armies far prefer to be manned by volunteer , professional troops . 
  some other funny words kiwis use are :, 
  - jandal for flip-flop/aussie thong, 
  - dairy for corner shop, 
  - chully bun for cooler/aussie eski, 
  there 's an australian film called [ little fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_fish_ ( film \\ ) ) , starring cate blanchett as a heroin addict in the sydney suburb of [ cabramatta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabramatta,_new_south_wales#crime ) , named for these because [ apparently they are used to package heroin ] ( http://www.tvguide.com/movies/little-fish/review/278485/ ) :, 
   the film 's title refers both to tiny , fish-shaped vials of liquid heroin and the small fry flitting around the edges of the urban drug scene, 
  yeah , he 'll just write whatever the first negative rumour he hears says , never pausing to axe any questions . 
  ha ha , yep . 
  pretty sure they never flew these off carriers ...
