  hey , nobody ever accused tyler rogoway of not riding his personal hobby horses . 
  hard . 
  not quite david axe , but not far off . 
  still , interesting in places i thought , though certainly one for this sub rather than r/credibledefense !, 
  yeah vf-17 were the first jolly rogers , were n't they ? 
  later redesignated vf-84 before vf-84 were disbanded and the jolly roger lineage was passed onto vf-103 ( the former sluggers ) iirc . 
  had her for nearly ten years now , part of a small , but well-formed , collection of two consisting of the explorer and an oris ( currently - had a tag , which i got rid of and have my eye on a few for my next addition ) . 
  bristol blenheims were used a lot early in the war too , as well as bristol beauforts . 
  fairey battles were bombers too , though they did n't survive much past first contact and were single engine , low wing aircraft , so not like the others . 
  it happened in rome . 
  perhaps the most notorious example is the demagogue politician publius clodius who was a claudian ( one of rome 's most noble patrician families that went on to form half of the julio-claudian dynasty of augustus and livia through to nero ) , but who not only adopted the plebeian spelling of his family name ( clodius instead of claudius ) , but even had himself struck from the ranks of the patricians and became a plebeian to allow him to serve as tribune of the plebs ( a significant republican political position with the power to veto any legislation ) . 
  this is much the same type of `` shocking '' behaviour , although combined with a political ambition that ironically highlights his patrician roots . 
  speaking of the cult of isis , what about the cult of cybele ... 
  she 's great , is n't she ? 
  where is `` here '' ? 
  the platform does make a massive difference exactly as you described . 
  he did n't mention that at all , quite a serious omission . 
  eurofighter typhoons can supercruise too ; however , gripen ( certainly ) and rafale ( iirc ) can not , nor can most 4th-gen fighters, 
  i thought it was a little better than that , although not to the srandarpes of a raptor or f-35 which are typicall clean anyway and would certainly be on any cap type air superiority mission . 
  a typhoon could fly air superiority pretty clean too , with recessed fuselage missile spots after drop tanks were discarded , as they often are before a2a engagements . 
  apparently clean f-16cj with the wide mouth intake can supercruise while clean incidentally , according to an article written by a viper pilot . 
  there 's the jolly rogers again in the foreground - like the vf-17 corsair you posted in r/wwiiplanes . 
  do n't forget the [ sabra and shatilla refugee camp massacres , initiated and presided over by the idf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre ) , in which thousands of innocent civilian refugees were slaughtered by the israelis fascist phalangist allies at ariel sharon 's behest . 
  how come when it comes to atrocities against israelis the attitude is all `` an eye for an eye '' , yet when the israelis are responsible they expect their victims to just get over it and brush off the lingering trauma as antisemitism ? 
  the pro-israeli ideologues have no concept of objectivity , it 's all a about shouting down any dissent and simple historical facts are what they hate the most . 
  it 's just the way they operate . 
  take the downvotes and be happy you can sleep at night , comforted by the knowledge * you 're * not spewing lies and propaganda , but fighting them . 
  that perfect , peach like bottom . 
  wo n't ever see that formation again , since the french retired their \u00c9tendards recently . 
  the croatian mig-21s look great though , very smart . 
  i 've never heard it in perth either . 
  more like hezb drone flies around , has good time laughing at bumbling idf efforts to shoot it down , lol , goes home . 
  idf comes up with lie about it being russian stealth drone because idf better at lying than soldier stuff . 
  idf good at shooting kids throwing pebbles , not so good at using complicated high-tech missiles . 
  poor idf . 
  sure , why not ? 
  if - as [ extreme-right-wing israeli press reportage has suggested ] ( http://www.thetower.org/2805-report-russia-is-arming-hezbollah-with-missiles-rockets-anti-tank-weapons/ ) - russia * is * arming , or even just training , hezbollah then it makes perfect sense for them to accept responsibility . 
  yeah , not quite b-52 longevity , but for a fighter it 's pretty remarkable , with the indian bisons and eastern european lancers still being pretty capable aircraft .

  more information about the event and the raaf 's growler integration efforts :, 
  when was that , if you do n't mind my asking ? 
  the ravens always had very cool markings , but my favourite is probably their late - '70s hi-viz prowler scheme with the blue pinstriping - very smart indeed . 
  it is an an/aps -6 radar pod . 
  [ here 's a discussion of the mods done to p-38ls to make them into p-38ms ] ( http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p38_16.html ) . 
  that would be a nice artefact to have . 
  has he said much to you about the transition from prowlers to spooks ? 
  very different jets and missions , but both stone cold classics !, 
  there is a particularly close relationship between the raaf and the vaq communities at the moment as raaf growler deliveries begin to get rolling , but generally there is a long history of cooperation stretching unbroken since the pacific theatre of wwii , through korea , vietnam , both gulf / iraq wars and afghanistan . 
  cheers , be interested to hear it from the horse 's mouth as it were . 
  ( well , via the horse 's son 's mouth to be precise , but you know what i mean ... ), 
  i think the night lighting was an alternative to the p-61 . 
  it only saw service in the pacific theatre , unlike the p-61 , and only during the war 's dying days . 
  there 's a bit about them in the link i posted in another comment . 
  well the primary rn faa torpedo bomber was the biplane fairey swordfish , which whilst an excellent aircraft that performed remarkably well , was definitely outdated even in ' 39 . 
  despite that it played a key role in several major naval engagements , including the [ attack on the italian navy fleet at taranto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_taranto ) which directly inspired yamamoto 's planning of the pearl harbour attack ( no link required for that one i think ! ), 
  as well as the [ pursuit and sinking of the bismark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_battle_of_the_battleship_bismarck#night_of_26.2f27_may ) , during which a torpedo launched by a swordfish from hms ark royal damaged bismark 's rudder , the definitive blow which prevented its escape and thus led to its ultimate demise . 
  however , the swordfish was obviously outclassed even when those engagements took place and the barracudas were one of the first types to enter service as swordfish replacements . 
  despite not being the absolute best type in their class , the last barracudas were not retired until well into the 1950s !, 
  sure , but the p-61 also saw service in the eto ( european theatre of operations ) too , unlike the p-38m . 
  that was what i meant , though perhaps i could have phrased it more clearly . 
  hopefully between we have now removed * any * possible confusion !, 
  ha , that song * always * reminds me of * dazed and confused * - even though it was n't even in the film . 
  strange how one 's mind makes these associations . 
  from now on though i am sure i shall always - correctly - associate it with its wwii faa inspiration !, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.freewebs.com/jim4jet/favfotosbig2.htm ) . 
  an khe was also known as camp radcliffe , or the golf course ( after how smooth the 1st cav 's commanding general demanded the airfield be made when they first inhabited in in 1965 ) . 
  by 1970 it was home base to the 4th id , having played host to the 1st cav , 101st abn and many other notable units between '65 and then . 
  edit : i mention an khe because hon kong was an outpost of camp radcliffe ... 
  i believe this aircraft is being recovered for preservation now , although i am not certain of how far the project has progressed . 
  certainly it 's a significant piece of history which deserves protection and conservation . 
  do you not believe the palestinians likewise deserve the exact same basic human right ? 
  the jews * have * israel , which is great , but why must the palestinians now be denied what remains of the land that has , for time immemorial , been their homeland in lieu of a * primarily * recent immigrant , non-indigenous , population of colonialists ? 
  great article that highlights the disparity between reality and semantics . 
  i can only imagine this will prompt isis to develop a robust anti-aircraft capability that they never previously required , you know back when all that was being dropped on them by drones was bombs ... 
  living in australia i feel quite spoiled by the general quality of meals we enjoy here , but i the intent of this question is meals enjoyed in a * foreign country * . 
  some of the very best meals i have eaten have been in the uk , notably including various curries ( including the famous [ lamb chops from tayyab ] ( http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/ ) or its great rival [ lahore ] ( http://www.lahore-kebabhouse.com/ ) ) and the brilliant grill at [ hawksmoor ] ( http://thehawksmoor.com/ ) ; however , london is never cheap , which one must surely consider overall and given i was born in london i am not sure it quite counts as a foreign country ... 
  so , even with those two nations excluded , this is a very difficult question to answer due to huge variety of places one eats on holiday , from tourist trap cafes to little local secrets people you meet let you in on , but overall the best food i have eaten overseas both in terms of quality and value would have to be in croatia , particularly the grilled baby squid , the famous [ croatian peka ] ( https://triciaannemitchell.com/2013/04/03/croatia-peka-culinary-trogir-roasting-meat-restaurant-recipe-food-travel/ ) and the lamb on a spit often found as well as seafood generally . 
  however , to pick the greatest meal i have eaten i think i 'll have to go with the $ 3 gyros i ate in omonia square , athens . 
  one of the best kebabs i have every had the pleasure of consuming and value you could n't beat with a stick !, 
  this is it sorry - i always do a reverse image search before posting , but did n't come up with anything else for this one . 
  i can try to find the article i originally found it in which has the photographer 's name as that could be another source - reverse image search is n't perfect unfortunately - but that will have to wait till i 'm not at work . 
  the tower is a notoriously biased , partisan and pro-israeli source , the exact reason i chose it out of all the other possible sources . 
  while everything you say * may * be 100 % correct , i think it 's somewhat unwise to believe that putin 's actions can be so neatly pigeon-holed : putin ( and russia generally ) will * always * do what suits their own ( often opaque ) interests and netanyahu 's well-publicised displays of submission to putin are not guarantees of future , or even current , russian actions in the region which are primarily focussed on maintaining their access to syrian ports more than anything else . 
  tl ; dr whatever netanyahu * thinks * putin `` promised '' , putin will always do what suits his interests and it is extremely naive to think otherwise . 
   it was the `` casus belli '' for the 1967 war, 
  it was the * purported * casus belli for the six-day war . 
  however , numerous israeli sources have attested that the war was in fact planned * long * before the events that immediately led to the israeli attack and any claim that anything the egyptians did led to the war is therefore dubious at best . 
  2 x gold for the oh so witty `` give it a few years '' comment . 
  smh . 
  oh well , let 's just wait for el presidente trump 's reign , then see who 's laughing at whom . 
  personally i am quietly confident that there are going to be a large number of americans of * both * political persuasions ( politics being uniquely binary in the usa , presumably because that 's all the complexity and * diversity * their minds are equipped to cope with ... ) sobbing into their craft beers and trying to finagle entry into yurop before this year 's out ... 
  edit : and now gold for the other one too !, 
  that could be me , hanging in the lounge with such fine specimens of redditkind . 
  if only i could tap into my inner retard bigot ... 
  let 's hope that 's the case . 
  the last thing anyone wants to see is conflict between israel and russia , or indeed any further conflict in the region whatsoever . 
  i did n't use either word , so i 'm unsure what your point is , but the sentence makes sense taken in isolation so have a participation medal for trying . 
  actually and factually there is no longer any conflict between egypt and israel , who have both been party to a peace treaty since 1979 . 
  indeed , now both nations cooperate extensively in several key areas , as is the case with jordan .
