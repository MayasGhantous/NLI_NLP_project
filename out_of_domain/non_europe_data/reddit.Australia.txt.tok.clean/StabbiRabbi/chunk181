  if there is still a war in anyone 's mind it is quite clear who is the belligerent , as your comment lays bare . 
  oh you 're * such * a comedian . 
  go back to 4chan and let the grownups talk , why do n't you ? 
  tbf , he could probably do with the income if the rumours about the parlous state of his finances have any substances . 
  no doubt he checks out r/the _ donald every time he feels the need for an ego boost , or a wank , so it 'll probably come in handy for him . 
  it is a lovely , graceful aircraft , but yes : it 's a repurposed passenger plane like the bismark was a repurposed cruise liner ... 
  it does , does n't it . 
  in further support for the notion , i understand all the soldiers stationed there were well known for all their cucci gear too . 
  are 3rar still the para battalion , or has that changed to one of the commando units ? 
  seems a bit of a gap , there 's a difference between what the socomd units do and what a conventional para battalion does ; especially given the adf 's strategic posture which is very oriented towards rapid deployment/expeditionary type missions . 
  i suppose it comes down the to the cost . 
  we have a fraction of the cash the us has and * they 're * drawing down their total number of para battalions according to an article i read . 
  night jump would have been cool , the crocodile exercises seem to be pretty full on generally . 
  it seems i did n't , so thank you to some kind stranger . 
  i just pasted the photo credit - should have proof read it , should n't i ? 
  a lot of german technology developed in the '30s was either developed in secret , was dual-purpose , or was even actively obfuscated as being for some purpose other than that for which it was actually intended , due to the political restraints placed on the country post-wwi . 
  the condor may have ostensibly been built as an airliner ; however , at least one eye would always have been on its military utility , even if only in terms of the manufacturing and technology required to build it . 
  the fact it was so quickly and easily pressed into service as a long-range patrol aircraft can not be considered mere happenstance . 
   this `` time immemorial '' thing is ugly nativism and has no moral basis . 
  so what is the nature of israel 's claim to existing where it does ? 
  without the ugly nativism of the zionist 's slavering lust for palestine israel could have existed from its very start quite peaceably in the [ jewish autonomous oblast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_autonomous_oblast ) in the russian far east , saving all this conflict , could n't it ? 
  your final sentence , whilst inelegantly written , could essentially be reversed with each people in the other 's role and still be equally meaningful . 
  one of mine too ( with the a-1 skyraider ) . 
  the g has a certain look of purposefulness to it imo , the extra bumps and bulges give it a subtly different profile from the e it was developed from and it always wore great schemes . 
  it also did a great job at what it was tasked to do . 
  all in all the f-4g model wild weasel spooks are one of my favourite models of one of my favourite types . 
  your cognitive dissonance is making my screen tremble . 
  you argue that `` ugly nativism '' is bad for palestinians , but they jews had every right to choose their `` ancestral homeland '' as part of the self-determination package . 
  well , if that 's the deal then the palestinians get to too , and guess what - they have the prior extant claim on the land . 
  zionism is an ideology rooted in notions of racial-religio purity ; israel must be a * jewish * homeland , not just a homeland for the jews , so sharing is n't on the table . 
  if you wo n't share then one has to leave , and why should it be the primary indigenous group ? 
  the zionist leaders should have chosen the oblast . 
  to not do so indicates an undeniable degree of sociopathy . 
  so how does anyone even begin to square that circle , beyond the simple justification of such vile bigotry as is obviously necessary ? 
  the ludicrous arrogance is one more sign of the underlying psychology , as demonstrated by your casual dismissal of the fact your final sentence * could * readily be inverted and still be equally true . 
  you talk of killing as if the palestinians are more prone to do so than the zionists/israelis : just look at the relative casualties though and explain then why they are so grotesquely unbalanced . 
  obviously you 'll now tie yourself in knots to `` explain '' that ; well , you go for it . 
  i 'm going to go to sleep , i already know the answer as to what drives this inability to see how gross are the double standards involved : a hubristic sense of self-importance and superiority . 
  on a slightly different , but related tack , as you 're such a nut for zionist principle , why do n't you make aaliyah ? 
  israel does n't need keyboard warriors , it needs cannon fodder . 
  you 're no good at this anyway , why not go man a roadblock ? 
  i think she may actually be having a seizure in this case ... 
  the shark logo on the tails looks badass . 
  they look so much better in operational colours than they did in the yellow primer i 've seen them painted in before . 
  heading to london at christmas , ca n't wait to pick up something from this series . 
  the dronachs are unfortunately rare in australia , though i am lucky enough to still have 1/2 a bottle of the 15yo left in my cabinet . 
  i got to go aboard the uss midway during a port visit to fremantle in western australia when i was a kid and they still let civilians tour the ships . 
  she was able to dock in the harbour , unlike any of her younger siblings . 
  a pilot from va-185 nighthawks , an a-6e squadron , showed us all around the ship , but the only supersonic jets it carried were hornets - no spooks by then . 
  nice picture of her . 
  that is interesting . 
  is one for ze german market and one for britain perhaps ? 
  do you know what happened to their night lightning ? 
  um , i guess he has n't checked out the american stats too closely . 
  fewer `` terror attacks '' , but more `` mass shootings '' seems like six-of-one and half-a-dozen of the other to me . 
  ugh , gross ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  michael or any variation thereof . 
  that 's some fine looking ... cats .

  it 's the government 's fault , those baaa-stards !, 
  sorry , but it 's [ ** 1800 ** x 1265 ] . 
  typo , but do n't want to repost and spam the sub . 
  the whole film is an absolute classic , including its awesome soundtrack , but i suppose * the * standout scene has to be angelina in the pool as the office lights spell messages in the background . 
  not because of the office lights though . 
  came for this comment , was not disappointed . 
  man , i did pretty much the exact same thing except we did continue to talk and hang out for a bit afterwards . 
  kick myself to this day , she was a nice girl and i liked her a bunch . 
   the new data comes as malaysian officials said that one of mh370 's pilots plotted a path over the indian ocean on a home flight simulator , but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane . 
  it may not * prove * he did so , but imo it adds greatly to the weight of evidence . 
  i sincerely hope they find the remains of this aircraft soon ; it must be absolutely dreadful for the families not even knowing where their loved ones lie . 
  in 1991 all the tech in the f-117a was ultra-secret and not the kind of thing they wanted to have sitting in a museum on public display . 
  it was only a couple of years after they were first revealed remember . 
  so # 781 was stripped of all classified systems and materials ( stealth coatings for example ) , flown to the museum and subsequently repainted to * look * like the operational jets , despite essentially being a stripped then prettied up airframe without any of its classified fruit still in place . 
  boy , china is going nuts with the love for australia recently , are n't they ? 
  between this and the south china sea threats you can really see why they invested money into our media to positively influence chinese interests in aus , and one * has * to admire their subtle finesse in achieving that goal ... 
  masters of propaganda they are , masters i say . 
  i always love that standard israeli position that `` other bad things have happened , so we can ignore international law '' , but all anger/resentment directed at israel is completely unrelated to their actions and attributable solely to antisemitism ... 
  i should have posted this link myself , mostly i will when something comes from an article , but i have to upload the image to a rehosting service for whatever reason . 
  so thanks for picking up my slack . 
  also , a word of warning about the source - tyler rogoway is like [ war is boring 's ] david axe-lite . 
  not * quite * as bad , but certainly more interested in his opinions than the objective truth on certain topics . 
  for articles like this he 's fine , but take anything he writes about new programs with a hefty pinch of salt . 
  edit : spelling, 
  akaroa is gorgeous , a really lovely little town and a great spot to spend a couple of days . 
  quite aside from the scenery as pictured here , there are the boat rides , which now guarantee sightings of [ hector 's dolphins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hector%27s_dolphin ) , perhaps the cutest dolphins i have ever seen . 
  that they can guarantee sightings is amazing given that the species was on the cusp of extinction not very long ago at all . 
  the whole french vibe in akaroa is another drawcard ; it 's a bit different from the rest of nz in that regard ( and has french quality cuisine widely available , as if another reason was even necessary ) . 
  that 's your circle of life right there , that is . 
  i do n't know , sorry .

  the story of how a small fleet of gloster gladiators defended malta alone in the face of overwhelming italian aerial attacks during 1940 is quite remarkable , and may be read about [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gloster_gladiator#malta ) . 
  n5520 is the only surviving gladiator of the hal far fighter flight , and was presented to the people of malta as `` faith '' in 1943 . 
  in akaroa , a lovely place to have a wedding of whatever complexion ... 
   nativism to me is the belief that because you are `` native '' to the land , you can deny rights to other immigrants . 
  so it 's ok as long as it 's the rights of non-immigrants you are denying , is that your position ?
