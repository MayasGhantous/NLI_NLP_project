  hey , you know what israel would win gold in at the olympics * every * time ? 
  mental gymnastics . 
  i only have two watches ( oris and rolex ) , one special pen ( mont blanc ) and no mech keyboards , but i do have healthy collections of single malts , diecast models and ancient artefacts ( bablyonian cuneiform tablet , ancient greek bowl , bronze age arrowhead , an old icon , some roman oil lamps and others bits and pieces like that ) . 
  selling technology to israel has proven to be a mistake due to their tendency to immediately on-sell it to china .

  iran is perhaps the classic example of fms to a weak regime leading to advanced us weaponry ending up in the hands of what became a hostile nation shortly afterwards , and i think that given the present instability in the me a similar situation could arise again if any regime change takes place . 
  indeed , look at the us weapons isis have been employing . 
  now think about how much worse it could be if the saudis lose their grip on power . 
  [ the aussie sas 6x6 lrpv land rovers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_range_patrol_vehicle ) were good bits of kit , though they 've been replaced by [ supacat jackals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jackal_ ( vehicle \\ ) ) for the sasr ( also used by uk forces ) and handed down to the 1st/2nd commando regiments in the adf now .

  hospital food is generally pretty dreadful , but you can always ask friends and relatives to help you avoid starvation ; however , as another commenter has mentioned the worst nuisance is definitely the sleepless nights caused by nurses doing obs every hour at a minimum on even medium-care wards . 
  it gets old very fast . 
  as the other commenter already also mentioned though the nurses , docs and other staff are all great and i have all the time in the world for those guys . 
  one never resents the interrupted sleep because they are just doing their job , and it 's an important job what 's more . 
  take a jazz cigarette for beforehand , one for mid-meal and another for dessert . 
   the irrational hate towards the actress goes to show two things :, 
   many so-called feminists are n't feminist . 
   many so-called anti-zionists are really antisemites . 
  i 'm sorry , but i genuinely do not see how such conclusions can be drawn from the quoted feminists ' words . 
  while a small portion of these women are perhaps antisemitic , i am quite positive most are simply genuinely opposed to the ongoing conflict in the west bank with its attendant horrors for both sides . 
  it is a dangerous fallacy that such echochamber sources as the publisher of this article fall into that ~ ~ no ~ ~ *** all *** criticism of israel , or distaste for those individuals involved in the occupation/settlement activities , is * always * antisemitism because it leads to an inability to critically self-analyse and realise when criticism * is * justified . 
  these people 's problem with `` zionism '' is , i can assure you from my interactions with other westerners in many countries in australasia and europe , for the greatest part ** nothing ** to do with wanting to see an end to israel , but simply horror at the plight of the people affected by the occupation/settlement/terrorism cycle we all watch as it endlessly plays through the news . 
  edit : fixed a wrong word . 
  yes , the owners clearly are either member of the imperial family , or sexually frustrated af . 
  btw , i think you need to blackout that license plate - typical reddiquette is to obscure all personal details from posts . 
  yep , easily within raaf strike fighter range - it 's perfect . 
  i see what you 're saying and should have included a disclaimer stating that i do not support not seeing a film because it has an israeli star in any way , shape or form - i think that 's a ridiculous notion and is in and of itself indefensible . 
  i just disagree with the conclusions , not the premise , of the piece , but with such a loaded topic i should have made my total position explicit , not just discussed the parts i disagree with . 
  thanks for pointing it out . 
  hopefully people will read this as well as the original comment and take them as a piece , editing the comment is only going to make it look like i 'm being shifty at this point i think . 
  i agree 100 % with that statement , but as i tried to explain i think these so-called sjw 's underlying issue is not with israel 's existence , but certain actions of the state , which imo is not antisemitic . 
  they may have expressed themselves idiotically , but getting too excited about them and their poor choice of words is potentially highly counterproductive is the point i meant to make . 
  idk , perhaps i chose my own words poorly too , but i hope it 's possible to extrapolate what i am trying to say from this reply combined with the other two comments itt . 
  i said i think boycotting the film because she is * israeli * is indefensible ; however , disagreeing with her very publicly stated politics is not . 
  a person 's identity and their politics are not so inextricably linked that one might take exception to the politics without hating the person for simply being who they are . 
  i did n't say `` not these women '' ; i said that automatically assuming they hate jews is mindless hysteria which represents a clear danger in terms of the dynamic it creates , a dynamic your comment exemplifies . 
  outrage manufactured by assumptions is equally stupid from the mouths of the women in question or from israelis `` victimised '' by the fact these people dare articulate * their * *** political *** beliefs ( gasp !, 
  sure , but dems de rulez . 
  personally i am not bothered in the slightest either ... 
  no no no , i said boycotting the film because she is an * israeli * is indefensible ; i did n't say * israeli * *** zionist *** . 
  therein lies the entire crux of what i am saying . 
  hating on israelis is bigotry , which i find extremely offensive , as do all other non-bigots . 
  disagreeing with the actions of the israeli state , or political `` extreme '' zionists ( ie religious nationalists such as kahaneists or the jewish home party ) , is a different kettle of fish , and entirely legitimate imo . 
  this is not splitting hairs , it is a significant difference . 
  i can empathise with atavistic feelings of being attacked when people criticise zionism because zionism originally led to the creation of israel ; however , as a westerner , modern criticism of zionism ( outside stormfront type arsehole circles ) generally refers to the `` extreme '' zionists as discussed above . 
  in these `` sjw 's '' minds , and those of * many * if not * most * other western critics , zionism does not equal the existence of israel , but the attitudes and behaviours of the ( largely settler oriented ) `` extreme zionists '' . 
  i understand that there is an issue here with nomenclature and language used - ie what is a zionist ? 
  - but i , from my own experiences , see what they mean by zionism * not * being the right of jews to self-determination , but rather the actions of the fringe elements of israel 's society/culture who are indisputably guilty of such actions as `` price attacks '' and etc. 
  more informed commenters would know to make the distinction , but these women are puffed up with outrage and probably ignorant of the subtleties and complexities of the present situation and the history that led up to where we are today . 
  to you and i zionism means the jewish right to self-determination , but to the women in question it means settler violence and bigotry . 
  this is why i caution drawing the conclusion that these people hate israel , hate jews and want israel erased - their understanding of the terms and concepts involved is lacking and to be blunt they are ignorant . 
  my key point is predicated on this understanding , but to my mind overreacting to stupid people saying stupid things is neither healthy nor productive . 
  if i ( as a member of the same culture as they ) felt they * did * *** hate *** zionism as * we * understand it i would condemn them roundly myself , but i honestly think they do not mean what you think they mean . 
  it is not helpful imo to lay the antisemitism label on those who are not actually antisemitic for 3 primary reasons :, 
  a ) it devalues and cheapens the word , diminishing its visceral power to disgust non-bigots ;, 
  b ) it adds to a sense of undue persecution among israelis and other jews , leading to unhappiness and a vicious feedback loop of lashing out at incorrectly labelled antisemites that merely perpetuates the misunderstanding and tension ;, 
  c ) it reduces the credibility of israeli complaints about * genuine * bigotry ( which is obviously an ongoing problem ) among outside observers . 
  antisemitism is as ugly and senseless as any bigotry , but not all criticism of israel is rooted in hatred of jews and claiming it is does not help the overall situation . 
  these women may be stupid and hateful , but i genuinely do not think they understand how their thoughtless words make israelis/jews feel . 
  except she is viewed as being stridently zionist politically , presumably after expressing political views which these people view as being the fringe stuff , seeing as the original goal of creating a jewish homeland has been long since achieved . 
  i 'm not saying they are right , just explaining their perception of the situation . 
  so they are , as i said before , driven by ignorance not twisted malice - both are ugly , but malice is far worse . 
  this is my point all along - they do n't want israel destroyed , they just want the palestinian situation resolved so both countries exist and judging them as though they do want israel destroyed is misplaced outrage that merely inflames tension more so than these silly , ignorant sjws actually merit . 
  it seems that there is a strong resistance to accepting that not everyone who disagrees with israel does so primarily because they irrationally hate jews that my arguments are failing to penetrate . 
  i can certainly understand and empathise with the sense of grievance , both for modern ignorance and ancient wrongs , but do wish it could be overcome with rational , logical analysis , despite the intensity of feelings words such as these womens ' must arouse . 
  surely rational thought and tolerance , even in the face of unpleasantly strident ignorance , is the only way forward , and the path to a solution which accommodates all parties ' needs ? 
  i 'm not in disagreement with that at all , nor am i trying to say these so-called sjws are right . 
  i really am just trying to point out that they are not agitating for israel 's destruction , but are rather ignorant people who do not understand the words they use , and expressing my opinion that painting them as being bent on said destruction is neither useful nor in the interests of israelis who must already live with the knowledge there are people who genuinely want to see their destruction . 
  you are from a western country , surely you understand me when i say most `` anti-zionists '' in the west are opposed to the settlements , not shouting for israel to be wiped off the map ? 
  certainly that 's the case in the circles in which i move at least . 
  good to see you commenting again btw , been ages since i last noticed your username pop up . 
  hope all has been good for you . 
  of course there are some real arseholes out there , and they rile up the ones who ca n't be bothered to read for themselves . 
  i guess my point is that while the anger at the ignorant ones is justified , it hurts the people upset by it more than the so-called sjws , who would probably be happy to know they had that effect ( fucked up , i know - not trying to excuse , just explain * my * opinion ) . 
  surely it 's better to recognise that they 're just stupid , rather than live thinking these people literally want you dead ? 
  of course i am an outsider , from both parties really though obviously closer culturally to the `` sjws '' and i ca n't fully appreciate the frustration and anger their thoughtless and/or malicious words engender , but distance also allows objectivity and i am humanist enough to empathise with the israeli position even if i can never experience it . 
  you know i have my own views about some aspects of the situation with regards to palestine and israel which do n't necessarily gel with many israelis , but i do genuinely support israel 's right to self-determination implicitly . 
  however , i know some people read my comments as existential attacks so i do understand the problem i am describing . 
  anyway , i definitely know what you mean about avoiding inflammatory subjects , which is why i 'd rather talk here than in the toxic environment of r/worldnews . 
  it 's much healthier , and while my views may not be agreed with always here at least the discussion does n't inevitably turn into a horrible slanging matche . 
  idk , but maybe an equipment capsule ? 
  they usually hand below the trooper , do n't they ? 
  i 'm sure someone military can answer . 
  u/spartan _ 079 was and australian army para , hopefully he 'll see this so we can both know . 
  yeah , i agree if we define anti-semitic as unfairly negative to israeli interests , but not necessarily hoping israel is destroyed . 
  i just do n't see them as wanting that , but reading these answers it 's clear anti-semitism is n't binary , but a scale . 
  ironically , you keep repeating that comment . 
  it is you whose originality is laid bare and found lacking i think oren . 
  no , everyone who wants an end to the conflict loses while israelis keep supporting and spewing out apologia for their government 's dreadful actions against the palestinian people - israelis , palestinians and anyone whose primary interest is seeing peace and stability return to the region . 
  so , au contraire , right now , * you 're * winning . 
  hey , just going by what you write man - i ca n't see into your head so all i can do is read your comments ... aaaaand judging from those , yes , that is the impression i get . 
  well , tbf , i 'm sure you do want * an * end , just not one that involves a single israeli concession , which is de facto the same as not * really * wanting an end given the palestinians have demonstrated their tenacity for nearly 50 yrs now , is n't it ?
