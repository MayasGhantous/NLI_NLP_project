  hopefully yours will turn up . 
  [ history of 1pru raaf ] ( http://www.adastron.com/lockheed/lightning/1pru.htm ) and their operation of the photo recce lightnings . 
  is he available for hire ? 
  i 'm in the midst of trying to finish off decorating my apartment now , and he seems to be much more of a natural than i am . 
  what are his rates like ? 
  does he take biscuits , or only fillet steak for this kind of job ? 
  largely gaining experience in being frisked for weapons and how to hide from mass shooters as i understand matters . 
  that 's why a ) they had to simplify english spelling so their poor little brains could cope & b ) american `` college '' is four years to finish off what is the final year of high school in civilised countries . 
  oh , and they also rote learn the pledge of allegiance . 
  that 's what i suspected , but thanks for the confirmation . 
  straight from the horse 's mouth is always best . 
  literally ... 
  i have asked for , and received , raises every year for the past four . 
  it 's gone very well imo as i now earn 50 % more again than i did when i started here . 
  if you know you 're worth it then you should be able to make your case successfully , or have the alternative option of finding another job instead if your employer wo n't play ball . 
  immediately behind the ordnance man are gbu-31 or gbu-32 jdams ( gps/laser ) , immediately in front are * maybe * gbu-24 ( 2000lb ) or perhaps gbu-12 ( 500lb ) paveways ( lgb ) and the ones without fins are mk8x series bombs not yet fitted with either precision delivery kit . 
  it 's quite hard for me ( not being a professional ) to judge the exact size of the bombs in relation to a man vs an aircraft , but i suspect the smaller ones are probably mk 82 500lb bombs while the larger ones are mk 84 2000lb bombs . 
  i may also have the exact version of jdam/paveway wrong ( ie the gbu-xx number part ) , but they are certainly a mix of jdams , paveways and bomb bodies without any guidance kits . 
  edit : rethought the likelihood of them being gbu-24s so added detail about gbu-12s ... 
  as an australian can confirm . 
  we quite literally live in terror of the king of england coming in and removing what few remaining civil liberties we still have left , unable to defend ourselves as we are . 
  even prince william 's baby son quite frankly terrifies me in my gunless state of vulnerability . 
  at least we had guns around when we were oppressing our native peoples , although now we are defenceless we have been forced to move away from the us gold standard in indigenous relations of making them all live in reservations and have had to formally apologise , grant native title land rights and grant them full access to our godless , communist social security system . 
  as for censorship , well everyone who is not an american understands life without the first amendment . 
  tbh , i am scared typing this - the cops could come knocking politely at my door any moment and yet again my lack of firepower means a peaceful outcome to that would be almost inevitable . 
  that guy sure has our number ... 
  subbed , thanks for letting me know that sub exists !, 
  now * that * is a sultry expression . 
  great photo of a lovely woman . 
  you 're quite right , they 're not cool at all . 
  nonetheless , we still unjustly imprison far fewer people in toto than does the american system and i think i would rather endure the conditions in the detention centres than a us prison , let alone a facility like guantanamo bay . 
  remember , it 's to the us we are being compared , not magic unicorn land . 
  of course it would be far better were the centres closed , but what to do with the people ? 
  accepting them into australia has always encouraged the ugly trade of people smuggling , a massive source of exploitation and misery in and of itself . 
  sadly my salty friend there are no silver bullets for the global refugee crisis and every country 's answer is flawed in one way or another ... 
  so no , we 're not perfect , but i still think we have less to be ashamed of than the usa . 
  finally , btw , it 's stuff like this which is why i frequent this sub less than i used to ; instead of being about light-hearted fun at the expense of our american cultural cousins it 's become a place where people come to beat drums and push agendas . 
  if that was what i wanted i would frequent srs as my meta-sub of choice !, 
  i am not trying to defend it at all per se , i 'm just saying it 's not something americans have over us is all . 
  the situation is awful and not at something i am comfortable with whatsoever . 
  maybe i need to rephrase my original reply because i had no intention of trying to justify what 's happening . 
  aircon helps a lot . 
  in terms of ending apartheid , being a political prisoner or being a pm ? 
  or do you mean mandala effect ? 
  it would n't be in any other context , but maybe if you glance at which sub you 're in and what the op quote is perhaps you 'll grasp why i might make such a comparison in * this * context ? 
  why , would you circlejerk about real shit relevant to you man ? 
  i do n't find manus and the rest funny in the least . 
  maybe it 's different laughing about it from the outside in , but i really do n't see it as humorous . 
  i can take a joke about australia , but that shit is not something i am ready to chuckle about . 
  it 's a matter of national shame , but it does n't put us on a level with the usa , with their insane imprisonment rates , gitmo , abu ghraib and extraordinary renditions . 
  anyway , it does n't matter . 
  i should have just left it alone and held my tongue . 
  thanks !, 
  looking again i agree , nothing without fins . 
  you and u/theanonymousthing have both listed some great books there !, 
  i 'm a massive flashman fan , and just reading another gmf collection atm - * the complete macauslan * , about his time as a junior officer immediately post-wwii . 
  likewise i also have hasting 's latest , * the secret war * on the go and it 's well up to his usual standards . 
  gbf - no need to say anymore ... 
  in vietnam terms have you read tim o'brian 's * the things they carried * , herr 's * dispatches * , bing west 's * the village * or * the crouching beast * ( about hamburger hill ) by frank boccia ? 
  i have a list a mile long of great vn war books , if you have specific interests ( eg lrrps , sog , facs , helicopter crews , sasr , rar/aussie , usaf , etc. . . ) i can share quite a few good titles on each - too many to just enumerate all though !, 
  for wwii , * company commander * by charles b. mcdonald is an absolute classic too . 
  finally i have a few recommendations for iraq/afghanistan if you 're interested too . 
  will definitely be checking both you guys ' recommendations too . 
  i love military lit too . 
  [ source story ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/4793/all-three-of-the-usafs-bomber-types-congregate-unexpectedly-in-guam ) , this photo is nowhere else ( yet ) i could find so no higher reolution sorry guiys . 
  they still * look * futuristic af . 
  they do n't seem to be quite retired entirely at least , with some still flying from tonopah afb for reasons the us dod has not yet decided to share , but are suspected to relate to testing of radars and etc against a well known stealth profile . 
  that was because nato planners got sloppy with ingress/egress routes and flew the same way every day . 
  when the weapon bay doors open the sa-6 could light the nighthawk up - the serb missile commander admitted he did n't lower the frequency of his radar or anything , just watched and waited , then struck when the time was right ... 
  stealth ops require ** much ** more than just speciall jets - every flightpath is fully planned to avoid radar and sams and there is usually backup from ew/istar resources too . 
  do n't know about the rain theory , but maybe - early stealth coatings were pretty fragile - hence the aircon 'd hangers at tonopah . 
  they * did * fly a fuckton of missions against very heavily defended targets without any other losses though , so idk if there is really much to that theory . 
  remember , these things entered service in the early - '80s !, 
  the old `` wobblin ' goblin '' is * still * a masterpiece of military aviation imo . 
  that 's why some still fly for whatever reason ( the exact missions are not publicised , but flights have been observed ) - the stealth design still works so they seem to be using it as a well-known stealth profile for testing new systems ...

  the `` flying porcupine '' , as the sunderland was nicknamed , certainly lived up to the name as `` n for nuts '' story illustrates . 
  [ red flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exercise_red_flag ) , flown from nellis afb ? 
  yeah , you have to wonder if that really * was * accidental , do n't you ? 
  one effect it had though ( together with desert storm and rest of yugoslavian nato ops ) was to make the chinese realise how desperately they needed to modernise , leading directly to the plaaf we see today with its increasingly powerful and modern capabilities ...

  [ description of leghorn , including photo taken from ground ] ( http://www.imgrum.net/media/1075116666355652591_2024468780 ) :, 
   there were about three or four main bunkers , facing out at all points of the compass with a few scraggly trees and several radio antennas at the very top . 
  about fifty yards beneath the bunker detail was a small shelf-like landing zone barely large enough for a single helicopter . 
  the helipad was made of sandbags and looked a lot like giant cobblestones from the air , while the terrain fell sharply on all sides except that which led up to the top . 
  repeated airstrikes and defoliant agents had kept the jungle cropped back making it all but impossible for the nva to assault with any real effectiveness . 
  more like bewildered as to * why anyone would want * to own so much consumer crap . 
  us society worships that kind of bs , and they ** love ** quantity over quality . 
  israelis and pro-israeli americans * hate * chomsky , despite his otherwise universal respect as an academic and intellectual powerhouse , because he has the temerity to question the israeli narrative of palestine , the occupation/settlement and other aspects of the history surrounding it all . 
  they venomously trot out the `` self-hating jew '' stereotype whenever he is mentioned and free-speech be damned because disagreement with the official narrative is * absolutely * *** verboten *** !, 
  it 's actually a bit discomfiting as an outsider because i think of that trope as being anti-semitic and racist ; however , any jew who does not toe the israeli right-wing party line almost reflexively gets labelled as such . 
  look at norman finkelstein , another very well-respected historian and academic who is universally reviled among extreme zionist circles . 
  dissent is simply not allowed . 
  if you 're a gentile who disagrees with * anything * the israeli regime does , well , then you 're an anti-semitic bigot ; if you 're jewish , why that makes you a self-hating jew ... 
  smh . 
  i love the thud , big bad bomber that it was . 
  real tragedy how the roe screwed their pilots so badly , leading to their high loss rate over nvn ( eg ingress/egress routes , payloads and other operational details being dictated from washington - a mistake the usaf has not made since ... ) . 
  sure , every generalisation has exceptions ; however , if you mention chomsky or finkelstein in r/worldnews , r/israel , r/israelpalestine and other similar subs i can assure you the majority of the responses you receive ( from israeli redditors ... ) will be full of bile and venomous spite ... 
  ditto for finkelstein .
