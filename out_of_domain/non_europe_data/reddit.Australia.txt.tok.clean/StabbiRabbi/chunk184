  of course israeli society is not a monolithic , undifferentiated bloc that shares the exact same views on everything ( as the existence of israeli ngos such as bts or b'tselem , for example , demonstrates ) ; however , the vast majority of commenters on reddit at least display the behaviour i describe above . 
  also , for those unfamiliar with the terminology , [ macv-sog was the military assistance command vietnam 's `` studies and observation group '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_assistance_command,_vietnam_%e2%80%93_studies_and_observations_group ) , a top-secret special forces unit that ran extremely dangerous reconnaissance missions into laos , north vietnam and cambodia made up of sf troops , recon marines , navy seals , australian sasr troopers and others as well as indigenous ( montagnard , nung and vietnamese ) personnel . 
  an rt was a reconnaissance team , which were given different names according to which region they operated in - state names were popular options for team names , eg rt colorado . 
  an rt usually consisted of six members - three us/western and three indigenous . 
  the one-zero was the american team leader with his 2ic being one-one and the third us member being one-two , while the senior indigenous soldier was known as the zero-zero and so on . 
  [ here is another sog soldier 's account of sog operations ] ( http://www.vietvet.org/noise.htm ) , there are now many out there including an excellent couple of books by john ~ ~ pilger ~ ~ ** plaster ** which detail the highly secretive unit 's activities in some depth . 
  edit : sog historian 's name,

  i have n't read them ( i do n't really keep up on his works , just having a fairly general knowledge of much of it and knowing most about his views on israel/palestine ) - what did he say ? 
  he 's a bit of a stuck-in-the - '60s anarcho-hippy who is certainly capable of saying some dumb stuff ; even on the topic of israel i do n't always agree with him , and that 's certainly where my interests most closely align with his work ... 
  i 've seen hmas canberra in port in sydney and she 's a fine looking ship . 
  this is a nice shot , from a flattering angle . 
  hopefully one day we 'll end up needing that ski jump ... 
  yeah , that fits my hunch about what he * would * have said - not everything fits into his political pigeonholes , but he would have the world mould to his views rather than change his views to fit the world ... 
  in the case you describe he has done exactly that : reversed cause and effect to fit his own narrative . 
  in that regard his intellectualism is a double-edged sword : he can play with language and concepts with such subtle sophistry that uninformed readers who do n't critically analyse what he 's saying end up buying the worst of his crap and valuing it equally to the best of his work . 
  his ideology is quite rigid ; ironically in a sense for the character he plays . 
  in that regard i can understand israeli misgivings regarding him ; however , there 's no need to throw the baby out with the bath water and if one applies one 's own intellectual rigour to his ideas there 's a lot that 's interesting , as well as dross . 
  banning him from the country ( as israel did in 2010 ; they have also banned finkelstein from entry in the same way ) and slandering him with comic book stereotypes ( `` self-hating jew ! '' ), 
  is not , imo , the right way to deal with someone whose views happen to run contrary to the state 's official narrative though , for that way lies authoritarianism or worse . 
  if you think somebody is wrong then do as you just did and articulate why !, 
  of course if your skin is paper thin though it 's easier by far to just lash out and deny them even the right to their opinions . 
  first amendment means you can still scream about being a paragon of free-speech even as while doing exactly that though , lol . 
  i bet if we asked the linked op if he believed in free speech he would answer `` absolutely '' with a dead-straight face ... 
  he 's definitely a smart and influential guy , and a genuine polymath to boot , but people like the linked op would deny that because they disagree with his politics ... 
  then they 'll deny him the right to have those politics - to quote the linked op he `` without a doubt has a mental disorder '' ... smh . 
  interesting , i bet that was quite often being where they were !, 
  originally sog stood for `` special operations group '' , but they realised that they were kind of showing their hand a bit too much ; hence sog was changed to mean `` studies and observation group '' !, 
  yep , and it 's all rubbish food - hormones , corn fed , factory farmed meat and etc. . . , bland `` perfect '' veggies and bloody hfcs in * everything * . 
  were you flying in hercules or super connies for that mission ? 
  where did you fly out of ? 
  you read stories of what those guys got into , or see the photos they took of pavn trucks on laos 's route 110 section of the trail and it 's just nuts . 
  i bet they loved spectre coming online for them !, 
  yeah , that 's why i added the explanatory comment - i realised it was jargon heavy !, 
  hope the explanation helped though , it 's interesting ( imo ) and when it was happening very secret stuff . 
  great pic of her . 
  yep , read * dispatches * , great book . 
  herr just died , did n't he ? 
  sad , he was a great writer and * dispatches * was one of the seminal books on the war . 
  * war * is great too , and you 're perfectly correct in your grim comparison . 
  it 's like george bernard fall 's * street without joy * too , another cautionary story yet to be heeded in full . 
  bang bang . 
  that 's some reality tv i could really enjoy , it 's a brilliant concept . 
  with such a flair for reality tv concepts have you considered running for president ? 
  that fur colour is amazing . 
  what a beautiful cat . 
  lucky puppy, 
  me too , she here looks just like one of my old girls when they were around . 
  they 're just my favourite dogs , so smart and affectionate . 
  that sounds right - certainly the snakes for ccc and states for ccn . 
  pretty sure the tools for ccs too . 
  great book , very thorough history . 
  there 's a really good large paperback photo history he produced called * sog - a photo history of the vietnam war * that 's really interesting too . 
  i can see why you 'd give that book to guys in a recon unit , it would give a great sense of what it is the job really means , as well as including a lot of technical detail that must still be relevant to a great extent . 
  yeah , that was pretty cool . 
  they did other combat jumps too , and some really crazy things like operate from platforms lowered on top the tops of trees . 
  really interesting unit . 
  great link , interesting photos . 
  as an aussie that does and does n't surprise me . 
  it surprises me in that i ca n't imagine living like that or how you 'd feel comfortable being in that position ; it does n't in that i am very conscious of the extent consumerism has taken hold here . 
  tbh it 's something that really alienates me from a lot of what i see around me , although when i was younger i kind of made the same mistake of thinking things matter . 
  sure it 's nice to have nice stuff , but you want to own it , not let it own you if you know what i mean ? 
  he 's great , is n't he ? 
  that would have been fascinating work , i have read a lot about the various operations against the trail and in laos - i guess you would have worked with the covey and raven facs a bunch , the sandy/firefly skyraiders plus the night owl phantoms and of course spectre gunships ? 
  so were you guys moonbeam or hillsboro ? 
  or did that just depend on orbit and day/night ? 
  thanks a bunch for linking the pdf btw - i only just woke up and saw your edit , but it 's on my list of things to do today ( saturday morning in australia ) . 
  i think the changing situation negated the need for the b version more than anything else , so it never even left the drawing board . 
  i can imagine there was a lot of traffic , especially when a pilot rescue was on - or a particularly hot sog extraction . 
  you would have been there for lam son 719 too i guess , i bet * that * was hectic !, 
  one reads about the battles around tchepone and it sounds absolutely chaotic . 
  that 's a b-52 / project delta doc - you guys were literally employing the same techniques as the guys pictured here 's colleagues !, 
  interesting they are still using it . 
  i guess the fundamentals just do n't change that much . 
  bing west is interesting generally - * the village * is considered a classic of small-unit tactics writing and describes his time as a usmc cap lieutenant , embedded in a rvn village with the local ruff-puffs . 
  mcdonald is great , really worth reading . 
  i 'm the same way with books , though the kindle is saving me coin on bookshelves , if not books , these days . 
  i will definitely look your suggestions up too . 
  i 've actually read all your first list and all but * the pacific blitzkrieg * from u/theanonymousthing ' list too , but will look into the two spanish civil war books definitely . 
  del vecchio is brilliant , is n't he ? 
  they all are tbh , a great mixed bag here between us . 
  btw , if you want a book to * really * break your heart then * bloodlands : europe between hitler and stalin * is a book ( by yale historian timothy d. snyder ) that will do it . 
  powerful stuff . 
  that 's in hue during tet iirc . 
  big shock , moving from guerilla warfare in the bush to hardcore urban combat , and you can see the toll it takes written on these marines faces . 
  hue now is a beautiful city ; scars from tet still remain around the place though . 
  my gia has a * bad * rep in the books i 've read , same as tchepone . 
  lots of aaa , lots of pavn on the ground . 
  you look from google earth now and it does n't look like much , but they were two key bottlenecks and had the crap knocked out of them in their time . 
  damn . 
  typically american : magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat . 
  * covet ( sorry ) , though tbf covert also works due to the level of sneaky fuckery involved in the retroactive legalisation of the theft in question and denials of deliberately provoking the so-called `` abandonment '' . 
  hey , it is - if you 're into taking risky bets ... 
  that looks so fucking good . 
  i just ate breakfast and now i 'm hungry again , damn you op !, 
  ( not really damn you , it 's just a saying in this case and i 'm just jealous ... ), 
  by the standards of other western democracies , * left-wing * *** americans ' *** views are basically the embodiment of authoritarianism , while their centre-right is similar to our conception of extreme right-wing fascism and their hard right no less than a festering nightmare ... 
  those words do not mean what the linked op thinks they mean .
