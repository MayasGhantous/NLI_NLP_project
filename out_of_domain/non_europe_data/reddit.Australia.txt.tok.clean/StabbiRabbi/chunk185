  actually , there 's a sub about just that : r/romesweetrome, 
  that 's brilliant , thanks for the heads up . 
  will be certain to read both . 
  those are two perspectives that are difficult to gain much insight into , especially comparative to western histiography . 
  would love to see that without the edits and deletions . 
  i bet it was a barrel of laughs !, 
  srsly though , america * allows * it ? 
  so i guess the big , inspiring coming together of nations to compete on an even field is just a what ? 
  a * standard * ( *** non - `` off brand '' *** ) english marketing exercise ? 
  a chance for america to assert it 's sporting dominance , given that the only `` world leagues '' their team sports play in are played solely in america and a few random isolated pockets globally ( that do n't compete in the `` world series '' anyway ) ? 
  an easy shot at * genuinely * being no . 
  1 at something for the usa ( as long as any kind of normalisation for population and investment in athletics programs is eschewed , of course ) ? 
  gracious america , letting the world band together and magnanimously pretending it to be an international effort . 
  thanks again !, 
  they were huey pilots , attached to no 9 sqn raaf who flew air support for the [ 1atf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_australian_task_force ) \\* , a brigade sized task force which was made up of both aussie and kiwi formations and individuals attached to deployed units . 
  1atf operated in phuoc tuy province , which , under the australian counter-insurgency tactics honed in malaysia during the [ '50s against the communists ] ( https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/malayan-emergency/ ) and , in conditions of extreme secrecy , against [ indonesian incursions from 1963-66 ] ( https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/indonesian-confrontation/ ) , was transformed from a safe-haven for the vc/pavn near saigon to being largely pacified despite its startegic value to the communist forces .

  two of the classic works covering the complete history of australian involvement are paul ham 's [ * vietnam : the australian war * ] ( http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780732282370/ ) and [ * vietnam : the complete story of the australian war * ] ( https://www.amazon.com.au/vietnam-complete-story-australian-war-ebook/dp/b008n4hy7w ) by gary mckay and bruce davies . 
  for sasr books specifically , gary mckay 's [ * on patrol with the sas : sleeping with your ears open * ] ( https://www.amazon.com/patrol-sas-sleeping-your-ears/dp/1741752884 ) and terry o'farrell 's [ * behind enemy lines : an australian sas solider in vietnam ( australian sas soldier in vietnam ) * ] ( https://www.amazon.com/behind-enemy-lines-australian-solider/dp/1865085901 ) are both well worth reading .

  yes , you do n't see it on the news because it is so untrue that * even mainstream us cable news channels * are unwilling to state that it is the case . 
  although of course that has n't been a barrier to their `` factual reporting '' of such emerging trends as yurop 's adoption of shakira law ( may hips be upon her ) and other long-standing yuropoorean social evils as government provided free health care and other social service safety nets ( that 's communism sheeple , wake up to the facts !, 
  exactly , the nato charter simply wo n't allow ukraine 's entry under present circumstances anyway . 
  one theory of the russian involvement in donbas and crimea is in fact that it was a strategic move aimed at forestalling exactly the scenario laid out in the article of ukraine joining nato . 
  nice job there , boys . 
  you can see why they felt they 'd earned the right to knock off early that day , ca n't you ? 
  the dornier do 335 pfeil ( arrow ) was germany 's fastest piston engined fighter of wwii and actually entered serial production shortly before the end of wwii , although only a handful actually made it into service following engine production issues and the common nazi diversion of effort into making a bomber version , a fighter version , a night-fighter version and etc rather than just pushing for production . 
  pictured here is v-13 , a b-2 heavy fighter / `` destroyer '' ( think bf 110 's role ) variant . 
  for more information about this fascinating fighter here are some sources i found interesting :,

  ha long bay is such an amazing place to visit , i did a three-day , two-night junk trip ( one night on cat ba island too - which btw has a simply brilliant selection of seafood restaurants along its waterfront esplanade ) and would not recommend spending any less time there than that , which was barely enough . 
  she 's just enjoying her dress 's sparkly bits . 
  super cute . 
  really interesting piece , generally , but especially for me personally as i work in the rail industry on software systems which are integral parts of systems designed to prevent precisely this type of event . 
  of course there 's nothing our systems could have done in this instance : if the wind gusts hard enough to derail a train it does n't matter whether the train 's equipment is all working perfectly , it 's still going over . 
  people really do n't get the meaning of `` nullabor '' until they see it , or read something like this . 
  loved that game and played it to death , together with the resistance expansion pack victor featured in . 
  after years of having been playing games on consoles ( including the ofp console games which just did n't match the pc original in any way ) i am now looking at building a gaming pc just to play arma3 , ofp 's true , spiritual , successor . 
  these saw use with quite a few us army cobra units during vietnam , where they had the power to shred through heavy jungle that the minigun simply lacked . 
  did n't realise they were still in service - bloody scary thing to be staring down i should well imagine !, 
  i reckon if he 'd been king * cunt * the great the tide have been much more compliant , sparing him from getting wet . 
  what force on earth is going to say `` no '' to someone with a name like * that * after all ? 
  `` hey , yeah so i got your daughter drunk and fucked her ? 
  remember me now ? 
  cool . 
  so , like , do * you * want to get drunk with me ? '', 
  sort of like that you mean ? 
  the black-nosed tomcatters schemes always look great imo . 
  more like donbas , from that regiment at least ... 
  this is image was taken in the coral sea , off australia 's north east coast ( where the famous wwii battle was fought ) . 
  during the exercise raaf ap-3c orions dropped air sea rescue kits and located personnel for recovery by the usaf pace hawks , as appears to be the case here . 
  other units involved included a usaf mc130p to locate personnel ; guardian angel para rescue and recovery ; and the e7-a airborne early warning and control aircraft to conduct networked communications . 
  this effort was also supported by an lcm8 landing craft from the australian army .

  same etymology as `` confidence trick '' , aka the con itself . 
  we aussies are known for our laconic style ... 
  as an aussie , i can not commend those nation 's stance highly enough !, 
  if only countries these days had the courage to discriminate against the entire kiwi nation in the same way the world would , imo , be a better place . 
  do n't get me wrong , they make useful holiday spots , but apart from that ? 
  like tits on a bull mate , like tits on a bull . 
  nothing , they 're alright really . 
  it 's just a joke between aussies and kiwis where we take the puss out of thim , and they prutind to fund it finny .
