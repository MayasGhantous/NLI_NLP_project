  i have trouble sometimes getting the right vowel sounds without * only * using ` u 's . 
  cool pic , and thanks for the link . 
  i like the f-35cs because at you get a splash of colour on some of the tails , and things like the grim reapers logo of vfa-101 , unlike any of the other services ' / air forces ' ( except the marines , which follow similar tail designs to the usn ) that i have seen pictured . 
  great to see the f-35cs in their natural environment too . 
  the usmc is planning to stand up an f-35c squadron as its 3rd or 4th ( i forget the exact order sorry ) lightning squadron , so there will be ioc for the c ( as well as the b ) coming from the usmc before the usn ( if my understanding of the timelines has n't missed something !!!, 
  ) , and soon . 
  for the pilots you mean ? 
  when pressed into use as low-level attack aircraft by nato forces in germany the aircraft earned the sobriquets `` widowmaker '' and `` lawn dart '' due to the high number of training casualties suffered , particularly by caf and luftwaffe pilots . 
  still a great looking aircraft and very advanced for its day . 
  in the late '50s they really would have looked like sci-fi starfighters , and the type performed a lot of useful service despite its issues when pressed into a role very different to that for which it was originally designed . 
  the f-104 's fuselage also went on to become the base from which the u-2 's fuselage was subsequently designed , both being the work of lockheed 's famous kelly johnson ( of p-38 lightning , f-104 , u-2 and sr-71 fame ) .

  shame these birds have been retired , they had a lot of character . 
  [ vaq-133 ( the squadron this aircraft is from ) also flew some interesting desert camo prowlers ] ( http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a396/afterburnerdecals/jammin%20jihad/dsc05466.jpg ) out of bagram which looked pretty cool , and made a nice change from usn ghost grey . 
  [ story of the battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_long_tan ) . 
  it is estimated the 108 soldiers of d company faced up to 2,500 main force viet cong regulars , losing 18 men for a confirmed body count of 245 as well as numerous blood trails and other indications of further casualties . 
  long tan was one of the most significant battle [ 1atf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_australian_task_force ) fought throughout the length of their deployment , and likely forestalled a major attack on the task force 's base at nearby nui dat . 
  [ i 've heard this story before ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6znf3vzaosm ) ... 
  plus the helicopter resupply of ammunition in the middle of the battle ... 
  just scatter the pieces on the floor and voila !, 
  who . 
  gives . 
  a. flying . 
  meth ? 
  education is pretty much universally acknowledged as the best , maybe only , way to combat fundamentalism ; alternatively , you can follow the israeli path and do everything possible to piss people off and see how that works out . 
  i guess they were * all * anti-semitic , huh ? 
  yeah , retired from the navy i should have specified . 
  so everyone else is stupid and uninformed , incapable of holding independent opinions then ? 
  i think you will find that most of these people are quite capable of watching the news , as capable as you or i in fact . 
  israel 's behaviour in the occupied territory is self-evidently egregiously oppressive and one needs neither a degree on the topic , nor to be personally involved , to form perfectly valid opinions on the matter . 
  there are other subtleties involved , but that much is indisputable . 
  looks like more than 100 to me mate . 
  the general consensus among westerners with no agenda is that israel should let the palestinians form a state and the settlements are illegal . 
  that is a view grounded in post-enlightenment , post-wwii morality , rather than primitive tribalism as seems prevalent among certain other involved parties . 
  it does not mean people want israel to not exist , just that we perceive the palestinians as being deserving of the same basic human rights as any other people irrespective of race or religion . 
  that 's a great doco . 
  good on you for linking it mate . 
  the kurds are strongly supported in the same way , while , as you know , the crimean situation is entirely different . 
  but enough whataboutery , why do you think the headline describes a `` sea '' of flags , with the pictures appearing to show the same , when it was really just a handful of strategically placed troublemakers ? 
  what i mean is , what level of cognitive dissonance must you be suffering from to perform such insane mental gymnastics so blithely ? 
  hey , i 'll tell you one thing for free : if you want a sport in which israelis would beat the rest of the world hands down , every time , you should lobby for mental gymnastics to be included in the next olympics . 
  well he is a type of soldier , but this specific guy is actually a member of the air force , so airman is probably the better general term for this guy , and certainly what his rank would reflect in its naming conventions . 
  if only it * was * an olympic event we could see how it played out . 
  anyway , it 's nothing to do with me - i 'm one of those westerners i was speaking about earlier who believe both people possess the same intrinsic human rights as each other - and everyone else - with the difference largely being the palestinians do n't get to enjoy theirs under israeli occupation . 
  i actually count myself a zionist personally ; certainly i am entirely supportive of the israeli right to continued security and self-determination as a homeland for such jews who wish to live there , within the bounds of israel proper at least . 
  as i understand matters that is the very textbook definition of a zionist , is it not ? 
  that was excellent , it gives a very good spatial picture of the events , as well as the timeline . 
  cheers for sharing . 
  interesting . 
  this is a type i have never seen before , which is , i think , a first in the sub . 
  good find !, 
  the marines ' current plans are to carry the next generation jammer pod ( ngj ) , currently in development to be carried by growler , onboard their f-35s . 
  well , they 've stopped training ea-6b ewos , with the last marine class having graduated fairly recently , but no more in the pipeline , so i guess a lot of those guys will simply finish their active duty careers with the aircraft , while no doubt other will retrain for different roles . 
  i 'm sure the skill set can be employed outside of the cockpit , on other ew equipment and in terms of mission planning and intelligence . 
  i do n't know tbh , but every marine is a rifleman , right , so i guess they could become grunts if worst came to worst ... ? 
  the raaf is on the same upgrade path as the usn with both super hornet and growler , so we 'll get the ngj too , which will be great for some of those ex-pig ewos ' capabilities . 
  not long until the growlers start entering service with the raaf now . 
  yeah , did you see the photo of the raaf pilots next to the growler with the no 6 sqn tail or the selfie of the raaf pilot firing an harm off point mugu recently ? 
  pretty cool , and in em spectrum terms we 're getting some kind of g550-based istar platform too , which could be all kinds of interesting capabilities based on what other nations are doing with those bizjet airframes . 
  all up i think australia is regaining a decent qualitative lead regionally . 
  was it the sam worthington narrated one ? 
  that 's linked somewhere itt iirc - it has the radio recordings ... 
  it 's on youtube anyway . 
  interesting perspective is n't it ? 
  and look at those ~ ~ 18.5 '' ~ ~ 18.1 '' guns from this angle too !, 
  tbf the israeli educational system is also producing an increasingly right wing cohort of youth , whose bigotry is deeply ingrained by government propaganda . 
  six of one ; half a dozen of the other man , or pot calling the kettle black if you prefer . 
  i have no words of support for the pa , let alone hamas , but kids need schools . 
  israel society certainly has democratic elements to it missing from palestinian , and of course the various intifadas , from 1st -  recent `` stabbing intifada '' have had an impact on the kids ' i mentioned bigotry and right-wing extremism , but the internal propaganda certainly contributes too and kids have neither the life experience nor the wherewithal to protest it . 
  hyperbole much ? 
  the murder of those ( idf reservist ) athletes at the munich games was literally murder and mayhem - this is waving paper flags . 
  get a grip man . 
  conflating support for a palestinian state and anti-semitism is just as bad as conflating the actions of the illegal settlers with innocent jews in other countries , or even moderate israelis . 
  we both know `` jews '' are not to blame for the price attacks and settler violence , just as wanting peace in the me is not anti-semitism ... 
  that 's definitely true about some palestinians and fewer still of their supporters ; however , imo the misperception that most people who support a two-state solution want israel gone is a dangerous example of a persecution complex devolving into outright paranoia . 
  for example i genuinely support israel 's rights as discussed above , without any reservation barring that already mentioned regarding the occupied territories/illegal settlements , yet i also support a palestinian state being allowed to form - primarily because i believe that is the only path to peace , which is ultimately what i actually support when we get to the root of my beliefs .

  smh , some people ... 
  it must be hard though , after ** 6 years ** . 
  honestly i just could not do that to someone , it just seems so cruel . 
  and that 's the cruel part - knowing that some poor person on the other end is so desperately believing your own sick little fantasy . 
  really nasty stuff imo . 
  cpuller = chesty ? 
  the aw attack and fast-fac roles the usmc f/a -18 d hornet squadrons do is interesting and i bet you guys are pretty heavily tasked . 
  thanks for replying with the inside gen. 
  always interesting to hear things straight from the source . 
  as well as the aforementioned ew/ecm role in jamming ieds and so on , i believe they also played an important non-traditional istar role as sigint platforms able to monitor taliban comms and use them to locate taliban forces ' location and intentions . 
  supporting the prowler 's capabilities in that istar role , usmc prowlers have been fitted with the northrop grumman litening at targeting pod , for deployment in iraq since 2007 . 
  i am not certain if usn prowlers have been too , but usn growlers now carry litening pods after they were first integrated with the platform for the raaf purchase . 
  although now a little bit dated , [ this article covers off the prowler 's various roles and equipment in some detail ] ( http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/prowler/ ) . 
  it did n't come up as a repost and i ca n't count the number of times i have seen the same story from multiple sources posted in this sub , but ok , whatevs . 
  no worries . 
  pitch black is the royal australian air force 's largest and most complex exercise in 2016 . 
  exercise pitch black is being conducted from raaf base darwin and raaf base tindal from 29 july until 19 august . 
  this year 's exercise features up to 2500 personnel and 115 aircraft from participating nations including australia , canada , french ( new caledonia ) , germany , indonesia , netherlands , new zealand , singapore , thailand and the united states . 
  exercise pitch black aims to further develop offensive counter air ; air-land integration ; and intelligence , reconnaissance and surveillance , as well as foster international co-operation with partner forces .
