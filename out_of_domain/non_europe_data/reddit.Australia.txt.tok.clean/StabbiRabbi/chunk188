   nah , there 's another car manufacturer too, 
  ah , hubristic american consumerism at its finest . 
  * this * is american `` culture '' encapsulated absolutely to perfection . 
  fuck melburnians are hipster cunts . 
  who * does that * to a tree ? 
  like , srsly ... 
  we call them seppoes , it 's rhyming slang ( a contraction of septic tank , which rhymes with yank ) , but yes : agreed . 
  kind of , not really . 
  it 's more of a joke really , like you would n't call people that at work . 
  not much anyway . 
  twat . 
  you 're ` avin ' a bubble , ai n't ya me old china ? 
  now say `` sorry '' . 
  see , that 's the same thing ... 
  really ? 
  i thought that was just a joke thing too . 
  people here say cunt much , much more than americans , and use it differently than in british english , but it depends on social context . 
  like i 'd call a colleague cunt , but not my boss and most of the time i would n't even say it around the boss . 
  it is also used in an affectionate as well as aggressive or derogatory sense here , which is kind of unique afaik , but again it does depend on context . 
  probably a moose , snakes usually run * away * . 
  can be both/either : https://www.google.com.au/search?q=bubble+bath+cockney&amp;rlz=1c9bkja_enau627au628&amp;oq=bubble+bath+cock&amp;aqs=chrome.3.69i57j0l3.9019j0j7&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=utf-8, 
  you just do n't see them very often at all , though you see snake tracks on sand tracks and so on . 
  if they have an opportunity they 'll slip away without you even knowing they 're there . 
  in australia we use some rhyming slang words in everyday vocabulary , many of which are the same as cockney or other british rhyming slang terms . 
  as with your grandfather , not many appear in every day usage . 
  certainly there are a few though . 
   `` hitler has only got one ball ,, 
   the other is in the albert hall ,, 
   himmler is kind of similar ,, 
   and goebbels has no balls at all '', 
  british propaganda like that little ditty , you mean ? 
  however , to quote the article :, 
   the wife of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had a jewish father , according to a new document discovered in the *** berlin archives . 
   the document was published in the german newspaper bild , the london-based jewish chronicle reported . 
  [ emphasis my own ], 
  one problem with your theory is that the document was actually found in the * berlin * archives , and first published by * bild * , a german newspaper ... 
  not the british archives , at least according to the article , with the first british involvement being the * jewish chronicle * 's republishing of the * bild * news item . 
  tbh nazi hypocrisy seems more likely than british propaganda that has remained unused for over seven decades . 
  edit : ah , only just noticed the ' 88 ' in your username . 
  now i find myself wondering if you 're a 28yo , or if * that * has anything to do with you casting doubt on this `` slur '' on the nazi leadership . . ? 
  nazis involved in hypocritical covering up their propaganda minister 's family 's jewish connexions ? 
  surely not - they were such perfect examples of consistency and probity !, 
  really though , this does n't surprise me at all . 
  goebbels could n't lie straight in bed and his wife was an absolute hitlerite fanatic who organised her six children 's murders shortly before she and her husband committed suicide in the f\u00fchrerbunker a day after hitler and braun did . 
  if such a woman could betray her children so , why not her father ? 
  oh , and it should be `` goebbels 's wife '' . 
  i can restrain my grammar nazi tendencies for individuals on reddit , but sloppy newspaper editors may be allowed no such leniency . 
  the possessive 's ' is always included after a singular word ending in 's ' , with the floating apostrophe , as used in the title , being reserved for pluralised words . 
  a very dark and twisted world - perhaps a post-apocalyptic , hand-printed edition ? 
  it 's certainly much too bleak for the real * onion * . 
  that 's a big burden just to get around . 
  i noticed tolls are a big component of that cost . 
  i live in perth and choose not to drive : public transport and taxis end up costing me significantly less than 22 % of my income as a single bloke . 
  this article is very interesting to me , as i have recently been questioning what path i should take in transport terms ( if you 'll excuse the pun ) . 
  edgy little 17yo druggy , are n't you ? 
  i bet i would . 
  one rocket with no casualties leads to multiple air strikes into heavily populated urban areas ? 
  seems fair ... smh . 
  if you * are * an aussie i would expect higher moral standards from one of my compatriots . 
  this type of gross overreaction is utterly immoral , as living in our society should have taught you growing up . 
  no , but the strip is so densely populated that inevitably civilian casualties follow whenever the idf lashes out like a mad dog in response to an `` attack '' which injured no israeli citizen . 
  ha ha ha ha . 
  ok , you come over here and let 's go toe to toe . 
  you 're funny . 
  [ let it go ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l0mk7qz13bu ) , move on . 
  sure , i 'll go get a plane ticket now . 
  brb . 
  no , really , i 'm just booking my ticket online right now dude . 
  swear to god ... 
  what 's with the googly-eyes ? 
  [ ticket booked ] ( http://lnx.musicairport.com/boardingpass/38138455.jpg ) . 
  you best be waiting at the airport , es\u00e9 ... 
  srsly , check the arrivals - see you there !, 
  you would n't say that to my face, 
  i 'm not sticking up for hamas , i disapprove of them quite as thoroughly as i do of the most moral army in the world ^ ^ tm - i personally think attacks on either side 's civilians are utterly deplorable . 
  in fact , you 're the only person here arguing for attacks against civilians , so please do n't try to claim any kind of moral high-ground . 
  to be perfectly frank , any such attempts is quite ludicrous on your part . 
  simply put , the gaza strip is one of the most densely populated areas on earth . 
  any indiscriminate fire by the iaf is * inevitably * going to result in civilian casualties , a fact the idf planners and their caricaturish villain leader , `` defence '' minister lieberman , are well aware of . 
  equally they are aware that causing yet more civilian casualties in gaza serves on hamas 's ( and the israeli extreme rignt 's ) purpose of continuing the cycle of violence . 
  if the idf really was the most moral army in the world then why not send sof , eg sayeret matkal or dudevan operators , to pinpoint the targets or even take them out via direct action ? 
  by supporting aerial bombardment within gaza you support the deaths of civilians . 
  perhaps `` if you tread on a snake expect to get bit '' is a better analogy here ? 
  that 's a very paranoid response , and an irrational one as i have literally never seen jews depicted as snakes in any media i have ever read , though i must confess to not keeping up with the anti-semitic propaganda press . 
  no , i was thinking more of the us right-wing extremists ' `` do n't tread on me '' flag : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gadsden_flag.svg, 
   why would israel risk the lives of its soldiers rather than conduct aerial missions ? 
  because the idf is the most moral army in the world ^ ^ tm of course !, 
  tmmaitw ^ ^ tm would surely think * nothing * of the slight risk to their soldiers such operations would present in order to avoid hurting a hair on any civilian 's head , especially because those soldiers are so well trained they could perform such missions in their sleep !, 
  i mean , the sayeret are well-trained and able to defeat any enemy , are n't they ? 
  or is * that * just more propaganda ? 
  tbh , it 's just so hard to tell truth from lies ( or versions a & b of the truth as presented by israel 's apologists at different times perhaps rather ) when it comes to the idf ; please forgive my poor little gentile brain for not being able keep up with which story applies when ... 
  sure , that is definitely the case . 
  and i think we can both agree hamas 's attacks on israeli civilians are inexcusable even if they are ineffective in terms of causing casualties . 
  believe me , i empathise strongly with the residents of sderot , who must still suffer great stress ( at the very least ! ), 
  whenever rockets are launched , even if the are intercepted or do miss . 
  i just do n't think continuing the cycle of violence is necessarily the best option strategically , even if it may be tactically/short-term politically necessary ; we can all see that violence always begets more violence and every act makes a political solution a little bit harder . 
  yeah we definitely have a shady past . 
  unlike certain other nations i may mention though we are at least trying to resolve our issues with the indigenous inhabitants of the land - and we have never used indiscriminate terror bombing to subdue them . 
  i believe the refugee centres are a matter of national shames , as do most australians ( another point of differentiation from , ahem , * certain other nations * whose citizens seem to verily revel in pride of * their * open air concentration zones , enforced with blockades and overly aggressive military checkpoints and etc. . . ) . 
  we have never bombed afghanistan , and in iraq are fighting isis , a cause * most * people globally agree is just : indeed , the real question here is `` why * wo n't * israel fight isis '' ?
