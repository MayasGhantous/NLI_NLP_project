  ( no need to answer , that was a rhetorical question ; i believe i have heard every variation of the apologia going already , though if you happen to have a * genuinely * fresh excuse you may share it , i guess ... ), 
  yes , as i admitted , we do have a sad colonial history which i wo n't try to make excuses for ( unlike the denizens of a certain me nation ) ; it * was * inexcusable . 
  however , it was something carried out in the past under the morality of the past , and these days we have enacted strong anti-discrimination legislation , native title acts and made a symbolic , but important , formal apology too . 
  were israel to follow the australian model for reconciliation with indigenous peoples i would have nothing but praise for the country and its regime ; it is the ongoing illegal colonialist project ( with associated vicious oppression ) and endless apologia to which i take exception . 
  ( i am , as i am sure you will know by now , a zionist personally as far as israel proper goes , albeit a zionist who is greatly saddened by the ongoing brutality certain sections of the israeli regime and population inflict on their country 's indigenous population in the course of this archaic colonialism they , almost uniquely in the world these days , indulge in . ), 
  the reasons for australia 's involvement in afghanistan and iraq/syria may cause you some puzzlement from your israeli-policy-centric view of the world , as they are not for our own gain ( an alien concept in terms of idf actions , eg initial seizure of palestinian land during the nakba , suez , the '67 war of territorial expansion , the invasion of lebanon , etc ) , but rather to honour commitments to our allies and attempt to help nations that are struggling with extremism . 
  as to whether these efforts have been successful or are the best way of dealing with the issue i can not answer yet , but we are not involved for cynical reasons of nationalism , national gain or out of hatred/spite . 
  take a while to consider this before lashing out with your keyboard again , pretty please o mighty keyboard warrior ; it must be very alien to you as an israeli , but you should at least try to understand it before spewing forth another stream of anti-australian xenophobic bile . 
  indeed , israel 's security - in the form of israel 's publicly stated position on isis at least , if not the backroom reality of the relationship - is one of the many reasons australian forces are currently providing the us and our other allies support in syria/iraq and why aussie soldiers are risking their lives in a region that , as you so rightly pointed out , we are not located within ( good observation skills btw , better than expected . ), 
  no , there have been no deaths on either side thus far , which i think is the sole positive from this whole sorry spectacle ; however , i was discussing * casualties * rather than deaths alone , and there were casualties , ergo my `` theory '' ( ? ), 
  still stands . 
  the level of understanding and general morality among all the civilised peoples of the world has progressed massively in the last 150yrs , and it would be a sad indictment of the human race if it had n't . 
  the horrors which occurred in australia to which you keep referring in your little hate-tracts were n't even carried out by australians per se , but rather by british citizens of the colonies which were then still part of the british empire ( an institution which has collapsed in the wake of the post-wwii waking up of both the colonialists and the indigenous populations of the world and morphed into the far more mutually beneficial commonwealth ) ; however , we , as modern australians , accept full responsibility for them and are doing our best - with considerable success in many regards , though sadly not all * yet * - to honestly make amends . 
  two wrongs do not make a right , and israelis claiming their brutally archaic colonialism is somehow justified by events that occurred 150yrs ago on the other side of the world is only not laughable because it is so venal and disgusting . 
  the attitudes of the israeli extreme right which you are espousing are grotesque throwbacks to a more barbarous era , as is the oft-repeated israeli right-wing/religious nationalist/religious extremist bigot assertion that the old westphalian concept of `` right of conquest '' should apply to the territory they have occupied even as they expect other nations to respect israel proper 's legal standing under the gc pt iv which completely supersedes the westphalian laws and absolutely disallows such land grabs . 
  why do such israelis consider themselves themselves above the laws and modern , post-enlightenment , post-wwii morality to which the rest of the world at least aspires , if imperfectly at this point in time ? 
  the primitivistic , atavistic , tribalism of such zionists ' beliefs is no longer justifiable and no matter of whataboutery changes the fact that both contemporary morality and modern international law has evolved far beyond such attitudes . 
  these days might does not make right , nor do two-wrongs and trying to excuse such attitudes or claim some kind of mystical exceptionalism simply does not cut it . 
  israel is unwilling to involve itself in regional disputes because of whatever murky reason it is they wo n't attack isis , but australia has chosen to involve itself basically from altruism , yes . 
  we gain nothing from participation , but are simply doing the honourable thing and fighting manifest evil in concordance with most of the developed world 's beliefs , beliefs that span religious , ethnic and political divides with only a few western-aligned , developed nations ( notably israel ) choosing to not combat isis . 
  i asked you to try to think about this clearly , but clearly it was too great a divide for you to bridge . 
  finally your last two paragraphs are simply two-faced : the first is a denial of your superiority-complex/xenophobic hatred for australia as a secular state and myself as an australian who dares take an interest in global current affairs while the second is a vicious attempt at a strawman argument . 
  the fact is our indigenous population possesses full citizenship rights as well as unique , legally-enshrined protections . 
  if israel were to accept all palestinians as citizens of israel with full rights then the conflict would be over ; indeed , such a solution would in fact be far superior to a two-state solution in every way bar viewed through the prism of zionist religio-nationalism . 
  we are far from perfect , but we do not claim to be . 
  we at least accept responsibility for our and our ancestors ' actions and are making progress , not acting out and inflicting constant and increasingly horrific oppression on the indigenous peoples of our nation while spewing forth endless streams of `` justifications '' , apologia , whataboutery and excuses . 
  * that * is where we * may * claim some slight moral superiority to israelis/zionists of your bigoted ilk , friend : at least we do not try to say `` nope , nothing to see here , it 's all good - we 're great guys , always have been , always will be and we . 
  are . 
  ** totes ** . 
  the . 
  right . 
  which is basically your message in between the fairly ignorant attacks on australia 's history and current behaviour , which display only the most superficial of understanding of the situation and our attitudes to it , most likely the result of a very facile google for `` ammunition '' you can `` load '' your keyboard with , o great keyboard warrior of zion . 
  one absolutely clear cut example : calling aboriginal australians `` aborigines '' as you keep doing is viewed as paternalistic and patronising by the aboriginals themselves and as such highly offensive . 
  the fact that you continue to do so quite so blithely is massively indicative of your attitude towards them , us ( other aussies ) and indeed indigenous peoples ( perhaps even all goyim ? ), 
  generally . 
  or it was just luck * this time * perhaps ? 
  no deaths is certainly less common than many deaths in the wake of such attacks , as the casualty figures published by various organisations ( even the idf ) clearly proves . 
  if , as you claim , the iaf * was * `` trying really hard '' to avoid casualties then this actually does prove casualties are inevitable : with all of the options available for low-collateral damage and precision targeted weapons available these days the fact any innocents were injured displays a cavalier disregard for what may have been better choices in terms of ordnance and tactics employed . 
  the iaf is a very modern force - did they not care , or are they simply incompetent in your view ? 
  why is this such a problem for you though ? 
  do n't you think it 's a * good * thing so few people were injured ( this time ) , on both sides ? 
  would you rather gloat over greater casualties ? 
  i did n't mean to give the impression i think * no * strikes are justified * ever * within gaza , because of course israel needs to be able to defend itself ; however , a single rocket attack which causes no casualties does not necessarily mandate a ** 30 ** airstrike response imo . 
  i can see how it may be short-term tactically and politically appealing to the idf and their master , the mad dog lieberman , but is such reflexive violence * really * in the long-term * strategic * interests of israel ( as a whole ) , assuming eventually achieving a negotiated peace is israel 's hoped for endgame ? 
  i would say no . 
  if , otoh , perpetual war or eventual extermination of the gazans is israel 's goal ( which i hope and believe it not to be personally ) then reflexive and disproportionate violence is , of course , the best course of action . 
  i 'm not trying to justify whites behaviour towards the aboriginals : you are literally tilting at windmills here in your efforts to slander australia . 
  i have acknowledged in * every * reply that we still have a way to go and are not perfect ; we do not claim to be perfect is the claim i have made for us . 
  however , if it makes you feel somehow better then sure , keep gloating over the things we do wrong and the aboriginals ' ongoing suffering . 
  we will still keep trying to fix it as best we can , we will still accept responsibility for the situation and we will still feel the shame of it whether you keep rubbing it in or not , so go nuts . 
  if you do n't acknowledge the jurisdiction of any international laws or courts then there 's no point in discussing any of this with you : clearly you are above the law , any law , or any attempt to make the world better and so have every right to do as you please . 
   if usa accepted all japanese as citizens , or uk accepted all nazi 's as citizens . . surely that would have ended the war , right ? 
  this is just utterly bizarre . 
  honestly , i have no idea how to even begin to address the holes in this conceptualisation of the events surrounding wwii and its aftermath . 
  what * did * they teach you at school ? 
  are any of the textbooks in english - i would * love * to read where you get this stuff from !, 
  again you end with some tawdry slurs against australia : we get it , you do n't like us and feel infinitely superior , for your transgressions have many excuses while ours have none . 
  the fact is that australia is a highly integrated multicultural society . 
  at work , literally right now in my employer 's office , i am sitting with people from five continents ( including australia ) , from four religions and of more ethnicities than i can count off the top of my head ( and we 're a fairly small office here ) and we all get along with each other very well . 
  in the past i had a jewish business partner here ( for some five years we had a web development company ) and we still get along fine even though he moved cities and i moved on to corporate work instead of running a business . 
  i will be picked up after work by a taxi driver of yet another religion/ethnicity . 
  sure ( here is this admission *** yet again *** ) we are n't perfect and inter-communal tensions exist , but we do ok and such incidents as the cronulla riots are so rare as to be counted on one hand . 
  i know a lot of such a scenario and the attitudes that lead to it are utterly alien to you , but things here really are not a vile as your cherry-picked , xenophobic examples make them seem in your efforts to provide yet more apologia for israel 's genuinely aggressive and venal actions ( not supported by all israelis , but obviously supported by you ) . 
  so yes , you are right about everything you have said ( the weird bits excepted ) , but still you have managed to fail absolutely to capture the truth of the situation in your ongoing attacks . 
  i obviously can not correct your ignorance as it is a wilful ignorance , held onto tightly in the face of both reason and fact . 
  in any case this article is not about australia 's crimes - it is about israel 's - and i have indulged your diversionary tactics and whataboutisms for far too long now . 
  if you have something better to offer than `` you guys suck so we can do what we want '' then share it , but otherwise i see no point in indulging you in your media manipulation tactics of distraction from the topic at hand . 
  so , please , write another hate-tract response , enjoy the last word and we will let the other readers decide what all of this has to do with the terror bombing of civilians . 
  i do n't seek to change your view , you wo n't change mine ( which acknowledges all the ills of my people you have drooled over so grotesquely , and supports israel in everything except the occupation/colonisation of which bombings such as this are an intrinsic consequence and part ) ; i have achieved my goal of laying bare israeli perspectives for those still undecided to consider and my work is done . 
  i hope you stay safe and there are no reprisals from the palestinians for these attacks anywhere in israel , especially not wherever you are . 
  let 's both agree to hope no more violence results from this little bout at least , shall we ? 
  the [ 11th acr `` blackhorse regiment '' was deployed to the republic of vietnam between 1966 and 1972 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_armored_cavalry_regiment#vietnam_1966.e2.80.9372 ) . 
  operating mainly in ii and iii corps , the regiment took part in several major operations and was in constant actions as one of macv 's `` fire-brigade '' formations , rushed to wherever in country they were needed to `` fight fires '' . 
  one of the first major operations they were involved in was january 1967 's [ operation cedar falls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_cedar_falls ) in the iron triangle region near cu chi to saigon 's north-west . 
  this was the largest operation of the vietnam war , involving some 30,000 us , rvn and australian troops from two army divisions , one infantry and one paratrooper brigade , as well as one armored cavalry regiment ( 11th acr ) . 
  the acavs were m-113 apcs . 
  two m-60 machineguns with protective gun shield were mounted at the port and starboard rear of the vehicle , and a combination circular & flat frontal gun shield ( s ) were added around the .50 caliber machine gun located at the commander 's hatch . 
  this combination produced a m-113 armored cavalry assault vehicle , or , in vietnam more simply referred to as an acav by gi 's , a name coined by 11th armored cavalrymen . 
  edit : another fun fact about the blackhorse regiment in vietnam is that gen george s patton iii 's son ( col george s patton iv at the time ) commanded the unit for a period during the conflict . 
  you say those politicians stand to gain , but how does forcing a highly divisive and unnecessary plebiscite instead of using this to push for a resolution within parliament benefit them , unless their interests are entirely at odds with those of the australian people and they are willing to service their own interests ahead of those of their constituents ? 
  yes , if you want to you should be allowed to fly an isis flag at a soccer match . 
  as another commenter said it would make you a massive dickhead , especially as you most probably * do n't * support isis , but if being a massive dickhead is your thing then so be it . 
  equally , people with israeli flags should be viewed in the same light . 
  obviously they would only be flying those flags to stir shit up with the celtic fans , who they know support the right of the palestinians to enjoy freedom from occupation . 
  but in the context of this match , flying an israeli flag is now a political statement in light of the celtic fans support for peace and a palestinian nation , why should one team 's supporters be allowed to express their political position while the others are threatened with prison ? 
   scotland *, 
  ftfy . 
  thinking it 's an irish team sure demonstrates you know what this all about and totes are n't talking out of your backside though , does n't it ? 
  sorry , but the same rules have to apply to both sides equally , do n't they ? 
  it would be * highly * provocative of israeli fans to wave their flag , especially in light of this ruling . 
  it does seem a shame the israeli fans ca n't express support for their team , but if the intention is truly to discourage trouble and not just silence opposition then banning * all * flags is the only possible solution now . 
  so both this double-standard when it comes to flags and your own bigotry is ok because they are just `` ignorant foreigners '' ? 
  i 'm certain the irony of your comment eludes you , but i can assure you it 's there in spades ... 
  a term deposit is where you place a sum of money in the bank and receive a higher interest rate for agreeing not to withdraw it for a set period . 
  you can withdraw it early if you want , although by doing so you will of course lose the benefits accrued/expected as you have broken the agreement . 
  it sounds like this could be the kind of thing you 're looking for . 
  you may choose the sum and the period of the term deposit . 
  here 's a comparison site of various nz banks ' term deposit rates : http://www.interest.co.nz/saving/term-deposits-1-to-5-years, 
  you 've got two there !, 
  double the fun , but double the trouble !,
