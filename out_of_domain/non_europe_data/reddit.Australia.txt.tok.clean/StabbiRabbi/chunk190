  no , that would most likely be an m48a3 patton tank . 
  the 11th acr was issued both m48s in tank platoons and later m551 sheridens into the acav companies from '69 when the m551s first deployed to theatre , as well as their acavs . 
  at this stage of the war ( jan ' 67 ) though the sheriden had n't yet entered service so , although impossible to definitively identify , logical deduction tells us it 's 99 % probability an 11th acr patton . 
  yeah , they look so sweet and innocent right when that pic was snapped . 
  do n't be fooled ... 
  chaos in 10 , 9 , 8 , ^ 7 , ^ ^ 6 , ^ ^ ^ 5 , ^ ^ ^ ^ 4 , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 3 , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2 , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 1, 
  i think the haredim are the israelis i admire the most tbh , they selflessly devote themselves to studying and are who guarantee the religion will live on ,, 
  as is their wont ... 
  more like r/mildlycreepy - i did n't realise that ants became sentient and anthromorphised just by giving them beer . 
  purple carrots taste really good , especially roasted imo . 
  his mother , the dirty bugger ,, 
  because people are outraged by backwards fundamentalist religious fanatics who oppress women perhaps ? 
  that could be why it reached front page ... ? 
  as you see the ultra-orthodox israelis/jews , so the world sees israel , specifically the colonialism in palestine ... 
  the settlements are parasitic communities taking the local indigenous population 's traditional way of life from them together with the land they lived on , and the settlers too get irrationally angry when * their * favored status is challenged . 
  edited to address concern of comment below . 
  a few comments above : https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4z357f/ultraorthodox_rabbis_ban_women_from_going_to/d6smaif, 
  this goes against everything judaism is supposed to be about . 
  the ultra orthodox create a bad name for everyone . 
  there 's your `` no true scotsman '' fallacy spouted by an apologist , within twenty comments of yours claiming no jew would ever make such excuses . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/4881/russia-has-revived-its-armored-trains ) . 
  these trains were last used during chechnyan and georgian conflicts and appear not to have been upgraded much since then , but if they are to remain in service it seems likely the aa defences would be upgraded with at least pantsir/tunguska style modern point air defence systems . 
  more scary than these armoured troop transport trains are the mobile ballistic missile launcher trains the soviets operated and the russians appear to be reintroducing . 
  i imagine they * are * also equipped with at least s-300 level sam systems . 
  duly noted and phrasing changed to accommodate your concerns with the previous phrasing . 
  do you think the conflict exists in a vacuum and the settlers are not a significant factor in that conflict then ? 
  can you not see that , to those outside of israel who promote their interests , the settlers are also just a group of people demanding special treatment ( eg that they be allowed to flout the gc pt iv and illegally colonise palestine ) ? 
  [ no true scotsman is defined as such ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) :, 
   no true scotsman is an informal fallacy , an ad hoc attempt to retain an unreasoned assertion . 
  when faced with a counterexample to a universal claim ( `` no scotsman would do such a thing '' ) , rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim , this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric , without reference to any specific objective rule ( `` no true scotsman would do such a thing '' ; i.e. , those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group ) . 
  this fits perfectly with the comment i linked . 
  `` no true scotsman '' does not require absolute refutation of their `` scottishness '' , but rather their * true * scottishness , exactly as per the quoted/linked comment i provided . 
  the author of the post i provided ( as the one example asked for of jews doing this ) is saying `` they 're jews , but this is n't * real * jewish behaviour '' ; much as you are in actual fact . 
  i do n't disagree with you when you say their jewishness is not being denied , it 's just that 's not how the fallacy works . 
  that is of course the flaw with armoured trains ; however , such a train is able to move large quantities of men and materiel quickly and provide a large amount of firepower itself with its organic weapons . 
  the locomotive is protected against aerial attack or ground ambush and the troop cars are also armoured as well as the train carrying aaa and artillery to beat off attacks . 
  normally attacks on trains try to destroy or damage the train as tracks can be repaired very quickly and easily in most cases ; once a locomotive has been destroyed , however , the train and its cargo are entirely useless and vulnerable . 
  [ here 's the wikipedia article on the topic for a bit more depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armoured_train ) .

  since when is terrorism justified ? 
  why , when it 's * zionist terrorism * of course ... 
  smh . 
  saved this comment for next time one of you guys hypocritically calls somebody else out for `` justifying terrorism '' . 
  it has been admitted by israeli officials that the forewarnings you mention were only phone calls to receptionist level employees at a time when bomb threats were common too , btw . 
  are you hinting you think that u/petsymmetry is perhaps * imagining things * ? 
  u/dharmabum2593 provided an example of why no true jew thinks like these ultra-orthodox jews in the article , but the example i linked and quoted did n't whatsoever , and was thus, 
   without reference to any specific objective rule, 
  a perfect fit , no ? 
  and the comment to which i replied asked for just a single example of this , so i fulfilled the stated terms . 
  i do n't disagree with either you or u/dharmabum2593 ; i was simply addressing the op at the head of this particular thread who claimed it would * never * happen . 
  i suppose people are interested generally in these types of story . 
  also , for people from the uk there have been other stories about this particular community in the past which may well have raised the level of interest from uk redditors enough to push it up quickly enough that it gained enough momentum to reach frontpage ? 
  i get what you 're saying though ... 
  no jew , or no * true * jew , ha ha ? 
  an armoured train would be a bit of a beast in bf , and no doubt easier to make at least quasi-realistic than the zeppelins ( !, 
  ) , but no : i actually linked * my * source in these comments ... 
  my source was prompted by current events what 's more , so good guess , i guess , but no dice here . 
  i think it 's almost ridley scott * alien * - esque ... 
  here , you dropped this : ' *** \\ s *** ', 
  travel , listen , learn . 
  then , maybe one day , you * might * understand . 
  textbook israeli/apologist response ; however , not the only perspective on the situation and i would argue one of the least complete , let alone valid . 
  as i suggested in reply to your other reply to my other comment , it may be necessary for you to escape the blackhole for free thought that is the israeli echo chamber before you are able to properly process any of the many other perspectives on the situation . 
  distance yourself from the noise and perhaps the signal can get through . 
  no , understand non-partisan , international perceptions of the abuses carried out under the aegis of the occupation . 
  very clever , but no . 
  modern as in modern armoured train , that being the anachronistic element . 
  yeah tyler rogoway is only one step up from david axe over at wib ; i provided the link because of the rules , not for anyone 's elucidation . 
  i should have added a disclaimer . 
  if the article was worth a damn i would have posted it to r/lesscredibledefence . 
  ( rogoway not being welcome at the `` think tank '' i am sure ... ), 
  however the picture of the train was , in and of itself worth posting . 
  what you say is quite right : armies will always live and die on their stomachs and logistics are quite core to the business of war . 
  it 's why i find c-17s as cool as vipers , but maybe that 's just me . 
  good analysis , btw . 
  that 's why `` no true scotsman '' is a * fallacy * ; being a scotsman is little different from being a jew , and of course being a scot is quite as binary as is being a jew . 
  nothing to be sorry about , english is a quirky language . 
  i ca n't claim anything close to your level of fluency in english in any single foreign language , but i know enough bits of enough different languages to understand english 's capricious nature , with its rules that are n't always true and so on . 
  honestly i thought you were making a quite witty joke . 
  next time pretend you were , if it happens again . 
  she can reel * me * in any day !, 
  my first thoughts were that a very '39 effect had been achieved too . 
  edit : spelling, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/3735/us-special-ops-mrzr-buggies-full-of-javelin-missiles-spotted-near-mosul ) - again this article is the output of tyler rogoway , who is a bit of a hack ( think david axe , but not * quite * as bad !, 
  ) , though tbf this is n't one of his worst efforts and the content is interesting . 
  just do n't necessarily make any bets predicated on what you read from his keyboard is my advice . 
  and this * is * a cool picture . 
  perhaps a pesh fighter they 're rolling with - those guys use all sorts of different uniforms . 
  as do sof troops , who are generally allowed to choose their own clothing , themselves . 
  that 's a really interesting generational gap picture - the last of the 1st gen tankers ( which basically matched the 1st/2nd gen jet fighters ) together with one of the first of the 4th gen fighters . 
  shows very clearly how far things came along in the 30yrs between the end of wwii and when this photo was taken . 
  i think that is very much open to question , especially as germany shipped him into russia deliberately to remove russia from their list of opponents ... 
  that is literally what some of these trippers think ... 
  i have even seen it argued that the * palestinians * are inflicting apartheid *** on the settlers !!!, 
  logic is not these lads ' strong point , is it ? 
  who the fuck wants to exterminate the jews in all of this ? 
  certainly not the celtic fans . 
  always with the melodrama . 
  this is a lie , propagated solely by the thoroughly debunked racist hate tract , '' [ from time immemorial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/from_time_immemorial#norman_finkelstein.27s_analysis_of_the_book_as_a_fraud ) '' by propagandista joan peters .
