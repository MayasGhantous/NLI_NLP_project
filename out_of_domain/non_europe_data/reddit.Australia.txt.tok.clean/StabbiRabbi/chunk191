  no shit , this is something i have argued for a looooong time , and which has already been admitted by israeli military/intelligence chiefs . 
  * this * is why israel wo n't join in the campaign against isis , not because they are worried how the arab world would react . 
  edit : this is not some israel literally supports isis conspiracy ; i just mean that obviously their interests are so closely aligned on some points that the idf has conducted operations born of their own motive and design , but which indirectly assist isis by reducing the combat power available to fight them . 
  well you 're perfectly welcome to think that over in auckland or wherever mate . 
  i you want to make cunts out of we aussies - as you are clearly doing in this xenophobic stream of hatred fuelled rants against us as individuals - and out of our nation you can do that over there too . 
  edit : punctuation . 
  could n't leave the mistake in case anyone saw it and mistook me for kiwi !, 
  as we all know , communicating in english is not your average denizen of nz 's forte . 
  right general time and place to have at least led to some such inspiration ... 
  maybe you 're onto something !, 
  i realise you are currently infesting australia ; all i was doing was inviting you to hop on a plane to nz . 
  great , well off you go . 
  jog on then . 
  we do n't need you here . 
  kiwis are well known for the difficulties they have attempting to communicate using the english language . 
  honestly , for a kiwi , you 're doing very well . 
  i can even almost understand a fair bit of whatever it is you 're trying to say . 
  so good on ya , sport !, 
  i know what you are talking about exactly . 
  different races have fought wars for thousands of years and eventually set terms then later still even become friendly - look at france and england , or more recently the former yugolslav countries . 
  yet the israelis * insist * that the entire palestinian nation , unlike all of those other human beings throughput mankind 's history , from all over the world , would rather live like rats , getting bombed or shot and having zero opportunity than even consider stopping trying to kill jews . 
  and that is one of their fundamental , enduring apologia set pieces upon which they test our credulity by constantly claiming some victim status . 
  that it 's not the occupation ; it 's genetic or something otherwise incurable in any case ... 
  that 's how they justify the situation you describe . 
  israeli exceptionalism is a given , but it seems this exceptionalism extends to the palestinians , who alone of all the peoples do n't care if their kids have a future ( sic ) . 
  as you say , faults on both sides , but ffs , enough already . 
  yeah , rogoway is the same . 
  often a reverse search throws up no other links , but then if they do there 's usually a hot stash at other end of that too . 
  if i can link from a . mil or . gov or wikimedia then i will , but otherwise they can have the traffic , ha ha . 
  q : what 's the name of isis 's air force ? 
  a : the iaf . 
  is this a joke ? 
  are you saying the * kennedys * do n't lie ? 
  really ? 
  oh , brother , you have to read some . 
  try sites without a . ie domain and you 'll be amazed at all the different perspectives and sides to every story out there . 
  do you think q : `` who do isis call on for air support '' - a : the iaf '' works better ? 
  throw all conspiracy theories aside and the kennedys are still just the scions of a bootlegger - something they never acknowledged or atoned for . 
  so sure , i 'll call rfk a liar . 
  even if he did visit israel what exactly was he eyewitness to ? 
  what a ridiculous term to apply to the banal platitudes in his `` eyewitness testimony '' . 
  seriously , not being sarcastic , what did you even mean by eyewitness ? 
  how does that relate to the quote ? 
  you still have n't explained the connexion between him being an `` eye-witness '' ( to what ? ), 
  and that turgid quote , also how was the quote any kind of eye-witness account and not just platitudes-on-a-stick anyway ; you * could * amuse us with your mental gymnastic display routine explaining that while we wait if you like ? 
  rare roast beef , horseradish on one side , butter on the other , tomato , slat , pepper .

  well , first you have to understand about the millennials . 
  there 's still some around , though they 're not as yappy since the war ... 
  though it is also true that nothing infuriates them more than facts , as facts cut straight through their bs like a hot knife through butter ... 
  they hate facts worse than anything . 
  lovely photo of a lovely woman . 
  no mtsvadi ? 
  all looks fucking delicious anyway . 
  yoda , in drag as miss piggy . 
  looking at that photo i think pauline is actually a lizard person . 
  never bought into the conspiracy before , but well , when you see it right in front of your eyes like that , how * can * you not believe it at least a little !, 
  could easily last a century ; the crusades went on for multiple centuries . 
  it was n't all that long ago that they were still having thirty-year wars , hundred year wars and so on . 
  some historians ( the great [ niall ferguson ] ( http://www.niallferguson.com/ ) notable among them ) view the entire 20th-century as an uninterrupted conflict , as he expounds upon in his classic * the war of the world : history 's age of hatred * ( book and tv series ) . 
  the gwot/war on islam could easily last a century or more ... 
  likud was formed by the same people as the irgun , to carry on the irgun 's legacy , but they are not literally the exact same group - if we use ireland as analogy , it 's more like the ira ( irgun ) and sinn fein ( likud ) . 
  as part of australia 's brigade-sized contribution to the war in south vietnam , [ 1atf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_australian_task_force ) , the [ australian sas regiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_air_service_regiment ) deployed a squadron for conducting long-range reconnaissance patrols and direct-action strikes against high-value [ vc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viet_cong ) and [ vci ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viet_cong_and_vietnam_people%27s_army_logistics_and_equipment ) targets in the task force 's area of operations . 
  the sasr troopers conducted both independent patrols and patrolling in support of other 1atf units and operations ; here we see a patrol preparing to leave [ 7 battalion , royal australian regiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_battalion,_royal_australian_regiment ) 's battalion headquarters to support the battalion during [ operation coburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_coburg ) which was run in the bien hoa area between january and march 1968 . 
  of note are the non-standard uniforms and weaponry carried by the sas troopers , who were granted a wide degree of latitude in their choice of equipment and dress while on operations . 
  [ d445 battalion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d445_battalion ) was a local force ( as opposed to main force ) viet cong battalion that operated in phuoc tuy province , primarily against the australians , who held phuoc tuy as their taor ( tactical area of responsibility ) . 
  the local force would operate in conjunction with main force units , guiding them through their area and providing logistical as well as combat support . 
  d445 btn was well-known as a highly effective unit , despite the degradation of combat power it suffered while the australian task force held its aor and was , together with the 274th and 275th main force regiments , one of the major units involved in australia 's biggest battle of the entire conflict , [ the battle of long tan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_long_tan ) . 
  oh the cognitive dissonance !, 
  it hurts , it hurts ... 
  the hypothetical presented you was * so * intellectually dishonest that one has to wonder : was its author * deliberately * creating a grotesque strawman because he felt you would not be able to see through the bs involved , or , more intriguingly , does his own cognitive dissonance permit him to * really believe * the analogy is relevant and apt ? 
  or , alternatively , is it simply just another diversion and distraction tactic , the usual whaboutery ? 
   the palestinian people [ ... ] are just bodies for hamas to use to wage asymmetrical guerrilla warfare upon israel, 
  except in every real sense , in fact in every sense except the two-dimensional propaganda picture israelis and their cohorts of apologists like to paint , the palestinian people are much , much more than * just * that : indeed , they are exactly like any other human beings on this planet . 
  dehumanising them as you are attempting to do honestly does your own cause more harm than good outside of the apologia echo-chamber where such dehumanisation serves the very real purpose of helping wear down those few morals the apologists still have remaining - if the palestinians are mere cannon-fodder , then * it 's their own fault * if the idf kills them and there 's * nothing to lose sleep over * . 
  however , despite the clear efficacy of this viewpoint with the circlejerk , the international sees straight through it ; these thoughts too then simply add to the disgusting taste in the mouth left by israeli actions against the palestinians . 
  the first step in fixing the conflict is for israel to accept the world does n't buy your bullshit . 
  not because the world loves hamas and hates jews , no matter how hard the echochamber would strive to have you believe this crap , but simply because the ongoing colonial project in the west bank is morally indefensible by any who value reason over mystical gobbledygook and do not buy into the deeply bigoted idea that the israeli nation is intrinsically somehow worth more than that of the palestinian people . 
  there was no jewish state , only a motley horde of illegal immigrants and terrorists attacking the uk forces for trying to keep the peace while the zionists yearned for the civil war they eventually started . 
  to whom was britain supposed to give weapons in the zionist camp ? 
  jabotinsky , the man who admired the fascists so much he was a personal friend of mussolini and led irgun in its attacks against british troops ? 
  menachem begin ? 
  terrorists to a man . 
  the after the british left palestine , and the zionists * did * start their war , they still continued to attack british forces ( famous early iaf pilot weizman admitting he went out to get his last kill not caring if he shot down an arab or a neutral raf pilot !, 
  ) ; and all this * despite * the massive amount of assistance britain had , over many decades , albeit a tad patchily , provided the zionists with and without which they would * never * have got enough of a toehold to even get started . 
  why , given all this , did the uk have any reason to provide the zionists with more weaponry than that they had already illegally purchased ? 
  as other have said , speak for yourself . 
  your post history reveals you are obsessed with `` playing * a * game '' , but real life and hoi4 are not analogous or remotely equivalent . 
  you must be too young to recall watching the falklands war on tv ; i am not - it is one of my first cogent memories from my childhood in fact - and i remember the british soldiers who died in agony as a result of these weapon sales from a purported ally . 
  so you restrain yourself to your * games * please , and absolutely refrain from speaking on behalf of the grown-ups . 
  here is the story of how the zionists deliberately attacked and killed neutral raf pilots , with zionist hero and early iaf leader weizman openly admitting he wanted one last kill ( which he got ) and did n't care if the victim was arab or ( neutral ) raf ( he was raf ) even as the ceasefire was being signed : http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm, 
  it is an ugly story of untrammeled aggression , of mercenaries killing the very people who trained them to fly and the awful gloating of the zionist `` heroes '' . 
  is * what * a plane ? 
  at least you are not hypocritically hiding your bias/bigotry , i can respect that much more than the true apologist 's line of `` we did n't do it '' !, 
  you are clearly none too observant .
