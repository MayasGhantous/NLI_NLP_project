  despite the * mistral * - design-based russian ships being completed and close to handover , upon the invasion of ukraine the sale was blocked by the french govt and the russian funds returned . 
  the ships are now for sale on the open market , with egypt having apparently purchased them . 
  still is ? 
  you have a citation for that one mate ? 
  i suppose though your definition of `` israel 's enemies '' is probably broader than the international view of them as only including countries/groups with which israel is engaged in direct conflict and lacks a treaty , what with the whole persecution complex thingy and everything ? 
  what question ? 
  if you mean this unpleasant little rant :, 
   you do n't think palestinians are mere cannon-fodder in at this very situation ? 
  meat shields ? 
  using the citizens as shield and propaganda ? 
  then i had already answered it . 
  as a non-foam-flecked-around-the-mouth-bigot i stated that the palestinians are * human beings * and much more than * just * the two-dimensional `` cannon-fodder '' you view them as in your horrific justification of israeli brutality against these * human beings * . 
  in any case could you please point me to the rule that says i am obliged to indulge bigots in their desire to spew forth hatred and bile ? 
  because i am pretty sure no such rule exists . 
  [ d445 battalion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d445_battalion ) was a local force ( as opposed to main force ) viet cong battalion that operated in phuoc tuy province , primarily against the australians , who held phuoc tuy as their taor ( tactical area of responsibility ) . 
  the local force would operate in conjunction with main force units , guiding them through their area and providing logistical as well as combat support . 
  d445 btn was well-known as a highly effective unit , despite the degradation of combat power it suffered while the australian task force held its aor and was , together with the 274th and 275th main force regiments , one of the major units involved in australia 's biggest battle of the entire conflict , [ the battle of long tan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_long_tan ) . 
  or , to put you entire comment another way :, 
   i know you are , but what am i ? 
  what have i said that is bigoted ? 
  it is * you * who will not admit the palestinians are people first , political pawns second . 
  it is * your * viewpoint that is solely rooted in an israeli-centric worldview that attempts to deny the palestinians there very humanity . 
  if you really are trying to condemn hamas , not just justify israeli malfeasance you really are not doing a very good job of it i must say ... 
  still , keep trying !, 
  maybe you 'll get better at expressing yourself with practice - stranger things have happened ... 
  there are a number of interesting books about carlos hathcock and his exploits , both as a competition shooter and as a combat marine in vietnam : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_hathcock#books, 
  of these i can personally recommend `` marine sniper : 93 confirmed kills '' and `` silent warrior '' , both by charles b. henderson ( who is also the author of a number of other interesting books about exceptional individual marines and events in usmc history , primarily circa the vietnam war era of the corps ) . 
  tautologous reply much there ? 
  jeez , try saying things just the once , why do n't you ? 
  repeating bullshit just makes it smell worse ; it * does not * make it true . 
  that is taken at [ lake matheson ] ( http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/westland-tai-poutini-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/lake-matheson-walk/ ) , near fox glacier township . 
  the mountain peak you see is [ mt cook ] ( http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/ ) , nz 's highest . 
  very beautiful place , as this picture well captures . 
  i have a bottle of the ruby i picked up when the bottle i went to buy was unavailable unexpectedly and i was offered a pretty decent discount on the ruby by way of recompense . 
  like your impressions , mine was of a decent quality albeit somewhat bland dram , but not at all good value for money - even with the discount . 
  certainly not awful , but not compelling in any way , shape or form either . 
  which of those states is israel in a state of conflict with ? 
  it seems my initial supposition was quite correct , thanks for the affirmation !, 
  reported for personal attacks mate . 
  you ca n't go around calling people trolls here just because they enjoy a better command of the english language than your own and do n't agree with every little notion in your overly-excitable , under-informed little head . 
  iran and israel are at war ? 
  since when ? 
  wow , normally i notice stories * that * significant !, 
  do you have a link to a story about war being declared and fighting commencing ? 
  well , no need to reply . 
  afaik iran and israel * are not * at war ; i asked for examples of countries or organisations that israel * is actually * in a state of war with . 
  you know , in the same literal sense that the uk and argentina * actually * were ... 
  why wo n't you just give a straight answer to a straight question ? 
  but i asked which of those states israel was at war with ... 
  * not * which state israeli propagandistas accuse of wanting to destroy israel and israel has adopted a threatening posture towards . 
  not which states israel * does n't like * . 
  these things are * not * the same thing as being at war , as the uk and argentina were , you realise do n't you ? 
  this just comes back to my previous observation , which you refuted , that the israeli false victim hood/persecution complex gives rise to imaginary `` enemies '' being given greater weight in your view than they are by objective observers . 
  and breasts that are humble , like mountains . 
   `` people get cold feet because they wear shoes and socks , '' he insists . 
  is it * really * that simple ? 
  can i spare myself the discomfort of cold feet simply by refusing to wear anything on mu feet ? 
  ah , ok , so now we come to it . 
   conflicts come in many flavours . 
  in the case of iran , it 's waging a proxy war . 
  not quite the same thing as an active , shooting war directly between the two countries then , is it ? 
  when was the last time that israel suffered casualties as a result of this proxy war ? 
  of course , i should have made that clear , so cheers for the extra detail . 
  it 's all too easy to forget mt tasman next to mt cook , but they are both beautiful peaks , especially from the aspect of fx/lake matheson . 
  btw , to anyone heading there , i have to recommend the restaurant at lake matheson walk - it really is very , very good and a lovely place to watch the sun set behind the peaks if you go there for dinner . 
  but hezbollah 's argument with israel is a result of israel 's invasion and occupation of lebanon , with its attendant train of horrors ( [ sabra and shatila ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre ) of course being the canonical example ) , not because iran forced them into it , right ? 
  no , not scoreboard arguments : * when * did it last happen ? 
  furthermore , what complicating factors are there ? 
  eg , hamas are on occasion supplied by iran ; however , their fight with israel is not because iran wants them too either , is it ? 
  so when were the last israeli casualties that were the direct result of iranian aggression ( something analogous to the iranian scientists israel has assassinated , for example ... ) ? 
  all along i have been asking for which nations britain is arming that israel is at war with . 
  you have asserted there is a proxy war with iran and i am just trying to pin down exactly what that entails and how analogous it is to israel 's perfidy during the falklands war . 
  so how is that moving the goalposts , or am i supposed to just accept you said iran and that should be good enough ? 
  perhaps within the confines of the echochamber such boldly bald statements are adequate , but we 're not in the echochamber now and * i * should like some clarification before swallowing your apologia , otherwise i fear i may choke on it . 
  the classic `` boeing tail '' !, 
  it sure does tie the past and the present , does n't it ? 
  neither were the irgun , nor the stern gang though , were they now ? 
  it was in large part due to the actions of such zealot terrorists that britain was placed in the invidious position it found itself in at that time in palestine , trying to keep the peace when the other parties doing their damnedest to ensure conflict ... 
  fifteen years * minimum * : our life sentences work on the principle that you are sentenced to life with a minimum term , of fifteen years in this case . 
  in fifteen years he will be eligible to * apply * for parole ; however , at that point her family may make their feelings known again and the degree of continued risk he presents will be assessed . 
  if he has not been a model prisoner , shown remorse and worked on rehabilitation , or if the family make a particularly telling statement he wo n't be released then , and will have to wait two years minimum ( iirc ) before even being allowed to make another parole application . 
  even if he is granted parole he is still not home free . 
  any transgression will see him returned to prison , and depending on the exact sentence this may well be the case for the rest of his life . 
  fifteen years is on the face of it too little for such an horrific crime , but the reality is more complex than just that number . 
  well , yes . 
  they actually called themselves the british empire at that point in time you do know ? 
  of course even by then the old imperial order was falling and nations with colonies were divesting themselves of those colonies , often much more peacefully than the zionist terrorists in palestine allowed to happen there . 
  today colonisation is reviled , and that was a paradigm shift occurring right about that time . 
  so i 'm sorry , but i do n't quite see your point . 
  what other word might one use ? 
  i 'm sure i know this , but right now i 'm honestly left scratching me head ... 
  ah , right . 
  i knew i should have known that one !, 
  what a weird thing to get butthurt about though !, 
  i mean do * you * care if i say `` series n '' or the `` nth season '' ? 
  i know i would n't be offended were * you * to use either while conversing with me ... 
  another manifestation of the legendary `` usa thick-skin '' , i guess ... 
  yep , boomhauer is definitely my favourite part of the whole show . 
  dale is good value too , but that dang ol' boomhauer mode of speech is what i truly * miss * . 
  no , we 're still discussing whether the uk sells arms to israel 's * real * enemies who are actively killing israelis as per when israel sold arms to argentina , or did * you * unilaterally move this discussion into some abstract void that is magically decoupled from the context in which we 're holding the discussion ?
