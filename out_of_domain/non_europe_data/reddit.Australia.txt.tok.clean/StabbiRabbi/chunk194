  not just modern society , but civilisation full stop i sometimes think !, 
  just another irony from the land that recognises no irony . 
  isis are run by israel and funded by ksa , who form a tripartite pact with the lizard people . 
  it 's all quite simple actually . 
  swastikas on their helmets too , and the side of the truck . 
  that 's the naval ensign they 're flying too , is n't it ? 
  would tie in with their name . 
  it is kind of a big deal , these squadrons are descended from the famous [ 1st american volunteer group , aka the flying tigers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_tigers ) , who fought the japanese as volunteers under [ claire chennault ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claire_lee_chennault ) , flying chinese nationalist p-40 warhawks . 
  when the japanese attacked pearl harbour , some of the 1avg 's pilots became part of the usaaf 's newly formed 23d fighter group . 
  one of the things the flying tigers were famous for were the big shark 's teeth painted on their aircraft , a tradition the 23d fg carried on . 
  shark 's teeth have been worn since by various different aircraft ( in the usaf and other air forces ) , but currently in the usaf the aircraft of the 23d group 's three squadrons are the only aircraft allowed to wear them . 
  it 's like an honour for the 23d fg and part of the group 's and the usaf 's history and heritage , very similar to the [ eagle squadron eagles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eagle_squadrons ) painted on one of their descendant units ' ( [ 335th fs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335th_fighter_squadron ) ) commander 's [ f-15e noses ] ( http://www.4thfightergroupassociation.org/uploads/8/2/0/3/8203817/7776858.jpg ) . 
  think of these markings as being like battle honours for an army regiment . 
  that 's something else , funny af !, 
  they * really do * think * we 're all * fucking savages , lol . 
  the smug , it hurts !, 
  then , just down the thread ( on haggling ) :, 
   i can see negotiation over big purchases , house , car , etc. . . but i absolutely hate the idea quibbling over a little $ 1 item . 
  if it takes more than 15 minutes to buy a simple item , just steal the damn thing . 
  americans are * so * honest too !!, 
  at last , a good news story out of the me , in which people are acting more * sanely * , and with greater humanity , instead of like complete psychos . 
  as the ever charming ms shaked quite rightly points out , how can one know what was going through the mind of a frustrated teen in a tense situation ? 
  how then can one sentence them on the basis of their `` intent '' ? 
  thumbnail looks like a civil war soldier ... 
  netanyahu and his regime cronies simply do not * want * peace ; this has been made evident by their words and actions time and time again , not to mention [ the assessment of their own security apparatus , who have recently reported that netanyahu and likud are desperate for a hamas victory in upcoming elections to facilitate the continuation of their own grip on israel 's reins ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-liberman-want-hamas-win-in-local-elections-fatah-officials-say/ ) . 
  warmongering bullies seem to dominate israeli politics these days , the country 's right-wing ca n't even be fucked pretending to behave in a civilised manner , let alone that they care about peace . 
  i 'm sure idf stormtroopers will always be popping in there every now and then no matter what happens . 
  it 's more that i have a great deal of confidence in israel , with regards to their military posture at least . 
  no peace in the middle east until expansionist johhny-come-lately states stop eyeing off others homes and political autonomy - eg isis , the ksa and etc in yemen , israel in palestine - unfortunately . 
  the peace loving indigenous populations * ca n't * live side-by-side with such fundamentalist oppressors , but that 's scarcely the peace loving indigenous populations ' faults is it ? 
  this is definitely true ; either that or you save and wait a long , long time until you have the required deposit and salary to match . 
  that 's not as easy said as done though , especially while prices keep rising faster than wages ; you can only do it if you are both advancing in your career at a good enough pace to beat the price rises and self-disciplined enough to not fritter away any increased earnings on `` lifestyle upgrades '' , which is perhaps not the case for a great many people . 
  wib is nonsense . 
  qed right there man , at least as far as any david axe inspired doubts go . 
  ooh-la-la !, 
  love it , great photo . 
  i would agree with this advice : it may be difficult to sidestep your lowballed offer to start , but you should certainly be able to negotiate a schedule for raises based on performance once you are actually in the role . 
  this has worked for both me and others i have known as it gives the company a nice cheap period while they get to know you , but gives you the certitude that you will be paid what you 're worth in a reasonable timeframe . 
  that 's a pickers mark from when it was on the tree - this must have been a structural banana that needed to be picked last to prevent the rest of the bananas falling and bruising themselves or even crushing the picker . 
  source : i just made all that up . 
  whilst interesting , i do n't think this bloke 's story gives us some kind of universal truth about tank crews . 
  i 'm sure some do sleep under their vehicles , while others do n't for nearly as many reasons as there are tank crews , or tank units at least . 
  yes , [ yes they do ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-03/australian-principal-accused-of-74-child-sex-charges-walks-free/7473246 ) . 
  but we all know none of these stories are actually true . 
  do n't forget now : israel is the most progressive country in the me ^ ^ tm and any criticism of israel or any israeli individual ( unless they 're a you know what , rhymes with scarab ) quite unjustified . 
  ah , `` relatively uncommon '' now ? 
  i was merely responding to this patent falsehood :, 
   there 's no violence, 
  duly noted , comment deleted as it was not fair . 
  what about riots over conscription , modesty patrols , domestic violence , stabbing at multiple gay pride parades ? 
  a [ very quick search for `` ultra orthodox jewish violence '' returns a very great many entirely credible results ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=ultra+orthodox+jewish+violence&amp;rlz=1c9bkja_enau627au628&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=1004&amp;prmd=inv&amp;ei=fohgv9o4ksnl0ash-76gdw&amp;start=0&amp;sa=n&amp;dpr=2 ) . 
  all together very far from the claimed *** no *** violence though , is n't it ? 
  i do n't think they 're comparable to isis or the taliban , but it 's very dishonest to claim the ultra-orthodox eschew violence entirely . 
  well , idk about you , but i have never rioted , nor laid a hand on a gf . 
  i do n't hassle people because they are not following the arbitrary set of rules i choose to live my life by to my satisfaction either . 
  the context here is an allegation of blatant sexual discrimination by the ultra-orthodox , no different to ksa . 
  claiming no violence is just somewhat disingenuous as a ) the direct comparison is n't violence , but oppression of womens ' rights & b ) there have been numerous violent incidents triggered by the nature of the community and its beliefs . 
  if op meant they are less violent than isis or the taliban he should have simply said that : no violence is a strong assertion that simply distorts the truth . 
  as we agree , that 's barely necessary , so why the lie ? 
  edit : i just noticed your edit about lower rates of involvement in criminal activity - which group of orthodox jews make up the notorious israeli mafia then ? 
  speaking of which , what about [ these guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikrikim ) ? 
  looks like some raaf servicemen closest to the aircraft : the darker blue of their uniforms is quite distinctive and noticeable . 
  indeed , raaf personnel served in no 105 sqn with some distinction :, 
   outstanding among the many decorations won by no . 
  105 squadron during the second world war was the victoria cross won by acting wing commander hughie ldwal edwards for courageous leadership in a raid by nos 105 and 107 squadrons on the dock area at bremen on 4th july 1941 . 
  edwards was the first australian airman to gain the vc in world war 2 . 
  coz fuck you , that 's why . 
  fucking primitives . 
  that 's just extra topping . 
  my rottie used to hoover up all the fallen mulberries in the back garden , every morning in season she 'd trot out there and thoroughly police up the night 's fall . 
  nope , netanyahu , though tbf i do see how you might confuse the two . 
  or , in other words : `` stop hitting yourself '' . 
  not really , it 's a question of morality . 
  in any case israeli title is dubious at best , given the number of palestinians at present denied even the right of return who still hold title deeds and even front-door keys to properties in `` israeli '' cities . 
  the world is on the side of the oppressed indigenous people of palestine because we dislike imperialist bullies , not because * we * are scared of political protesters . 
  the world had already changed and evolved before the zionists turned palestine into disputed territory with their crazed brand of nationalistic terrorism and violence ( eg jabotinsky - leader of the irgun friend of mussolini , the first truly modern terrorist in the me , [ an israeli hero ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) whose very name is anathema among the civilised peoples of the world - or shamir , sharon , begin , shaked ; all are equally vile ) , it is merely the israeli right with their willfully primitivistic tribalism who are throwbacks to the pre-wwii era . 
  the irony is that it was in great part the suffering of europe 's jews that prompted the modern international legal principles that the equally ultra-right-wing-nationalist-extremist israeli descendants of those zionist terrorist flout so egregiously . 
   i know you are , but what am i ? 
  sorry to paraphrase , but i think i captured the essence of your comment far more pithily than the original managed . 
   facts, 
   history, 
  those words do not mean what you seem to think they mean . 
  it is , you will find everyone outside the israeli right agrees , the israeli right who are responsible for the endless continuation of the conflict . 
  exit the echochamber , clean out your ears and you might learn something . 
  sorry , but that 's not a zero , a ki-100 or a ki-61 - the zero and ki-100 had an entirely different `` glasshouse '' style canopy , while the ki-61 employed an inline engine whereas this looks more like a radial . 
  what it looks most like is another mitsubishi aircraft , the [ j2m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitsubishi_j2m ) raiden , called the * jack * by the allies reporting system . 
  thanks for posting - it 's an interesting picture . 
  you should also try x-posting some of these to r/wwiiplanes - the guys there will love these , especially if you put together an album or two !, 
  i think that sadly we can expect to see more such sites uncovered , exactly as the article suggests . 
  i have no doubt the chamber of horrors left behind by isis will challenge even saddam 's record for brutality in these areas . 
  ok , entire comment history in this sub . 
  ( i do n't care enough to actually check your post history out , but i have seen you make a splash in here recently . ), 
  reported for personal attacks . 
  actually , [ yes , it could well be on skis ] ( http://ww2db.com/image.php?image_id=10003 ) . 
  p-38gs deployed to alaska were certainly equipped with skis , as in the linked picture , and while i am not certain about p-38es i do n't see why not . 
  it looks like skis in your photo , imo anyway . 
   you can confirm this by looking at how the corresponding bits combine with & in the truth table . 
   this eeensult * must * be avenged tovarisch .
