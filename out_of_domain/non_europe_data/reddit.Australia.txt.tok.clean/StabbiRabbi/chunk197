  there is zero transparency to this entire charade . 
  fewer visa restrictions . 
  fuck kiwis are shit at english . 
  yes , less of my snark would be correct . 
  however , that second sentence just proves my point , so you can forget about that . 
  to reiterate : fuck kiwis are shit at english . 
  we had a student from brunei at my school who came on our bush camp in i think year 9 . 
  of course we were fucking with him , telling him about drop bears and hoop snakes , so when we were walking down a bush track and he was near the front would be when we come across a bobtail lizard sunning itself on the track the most was made of the situation . 
  the next guy behind him shouted out `` hoop snake '' and immediately the guy from brunei screams , turns and runs , still screaming , to the back of the group . 
  oh how we laughed !, 
  of course , he 's the one laughing now seeing as we 're all grown up , and he had some family connexion to the prince of brunei while afaik the rest of us are not anywhere near royalty . 
  good post , these guys are nuts , but you debunked his rubbish brilliantly . 
  the afghan a-29s mentioned in the article also took part in a green flag earlier this year - looks like they 're becoming regular attendees . 
  i usually take mine neat , but i 'll take it however it comes to suit the circumstances . 
  on a hot day you ca n't beat a whisky and soda with a bunch of ice , though i would usually order a lesser quality than usual shot to go in that drink . 
  old fashioneds and so on can be nice too . 
  but generally neat is my preference , especially if i 'm drinking to enjoy the whisky itself . 
  i 've read that bing west book * no true glory : a front-line account of the battle of fallujah * that he is talked of in , but i was n't aware he had been killed . 
  good book , as are all of west 's . 
  with petrol ? 
  done . 
  what now ? 
  ha , humans . 
  most redditors are bots dude . 
  coz fuck you , that 's why . 
  yeah , well , you know , that 's just like your opinion , man . 
  it 's ironic that you 're using an academic argument to support your position that in general usage less is equally correct . 
  it may be common usage , but most i know prefer fewer . 
  ( well , educated people at least . ), 
  lol , you 're ( unintentionally i assume ) funny . 
  so ferocious !, 
  such patronising rubbish you spew !, 
  i am quite aware that less is accepted common usage , but then so are a lot of dreadful abuses of the english language . 
  in my opinion their language * was * shit , with flaws that ran far deeper than a single word . 
  in any case , i was not talking solely about them , but kiwis generally , and , unless you are either one yourself or have never heard any of them mangle the language with their appalling efforts at speaking it , you * must * know exactly to what i am referring . 
  why are you white-knighting for * kiwis * anyway ? 
  why do you even gaf ? 
  they 're dreadful people who speak dreadful english ; ergo my point still stands . 
  you 're some kind of pedant novelty account , are n't you ? 
  i looked through your comment history and it 's almost exclusively this kind of rubbish . 
  if it 's been accepted as the correct usage since 1770 , no matter what the source of that acceptance , then it 's still the accepted correct usage . 
  and how is stating my point still stands in any way , shape or form * backpedalling * ? 
  stupid *** and *** pedantic - you must be fun at parties . 
  ha ha , you really do your schtick perfectly . 
  you could cut the irony with a knife !, 
  hilarious , though it does get a tad tedious after a bit . 
  if you really do teach students irl i do n't envy them , it must get old quickly . 
  expecting people to read your comments as though they are worth taking seriously is really asking a bit much . 
  i know she 's an extremist and everything , but i would ( hate ) fuck the shit out of ayelet shaked . 
  something something cunts too . 
  who * did n't * see * this * coming . . ? 
  that 's just weird , man . 
  to crush my enemies . 
  see them driven before me . 
  hear the lamentations of their women, 
  because we all know , the internet * only works in english * . 
  not commonwealth english either . 
  nations who have been to the moon english ... 
   *** a few years ago *** , a woman of indian descent , nina davuluri , faced twitter *** abuse after being crowned miss america *** . 
  some *** called her an `` arab '' , some a `` terrorist '' , and some an `` arab terrorist '' *** . 
  indians , in large numbers , came to her defence . 
  quote taken straight from the article the quoted op was commenting on , emphasis my own . 
  what was that about becoming american despite your ethnic origin ? 
  and remember , refreshing * aspartame * ^ ^ tm make anything taste sweeter !, 
  mundane is what a lot of people find most endearing . 
  how about pretending to be john cleese and hissing `` do n't mention the war '' at regular intervals ? 
  do n't worry , it 's not actually cool . 
  hey , at least i can * understand * american accents - there have been many occasions where i genuinely have not been able to work out exactly what a kiwi is trying to say . 
  i dislike americans generally , as do many australians . 
  we actually use `` loud , arrogant jackasses '' and `` american '' as synonyms . 
  of course , * we * have manners ( google it ) so we do n't let on , but we 're all thinking `` fucking seppoes '' whenever we hear the accent . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  well , i was just being honest for op 's sake , instead of hiding the truth as i felt that would have been ruder under the circumstances . 
  you are right though , i should have at least acknowledged that americans have heard of manners . 
  really it 's just they do n't practice them . 
  ( at least not as civilised people understand the term , eg the weird way you guys use cutlery , i mean wtf is up with * that * ? ), 
  yeah , but wow players are usually just happy someone is interacting with them and anyway it 's not like you 're physically present , you know ? 
  do n't forget some americans are cool , the usa is a big place ( well , it has a high population anyway ) . 
  perhaps you 're one of the cool ones ? 
  it 's also true that once you know people as individuals you do n't care about their nationality : the * instinctive * dislike only applies en masse . 
  do n't flatter yourself ; you could n't stop me if you tried . 
  that said , previously i was n't actually trying to insult you , i genuinely thought it was some kind of role play ( `` surely nobody could * naturally * be so shrill * and * pompous * simultaneously * '' being my reasoning ) and you would appreciate the seemingly appropriate responses ; however , it seems i may have been incorrect and i perhaps owe you an apology of sorts . 
  you may take that as your apology . 
  there 's nothing for me to defend , btw . 
  i 'm going to take a wild guess and assume you 're not actually a kiwi , but rather either a ( whinging ) pom or ( typically humourless ) seppo ? 
  certainly were you a kiwi you would have understood that , as an aussie , i have every right to take the piss out of kiwis in whatever way i like , especially as pertains to their communication skills . 
  recommend what you like , you 're not the type of person to take seriously so i can promise you any and all such advice shall go entirely unheeded . 
  particularly as your entire argument is predicated on a single reference you dredged up , whereas there are [ countless sources to support my position ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fewer+vs+less ) . 
  that is a * great * picture of her . 
  i had copied the exact same paragraphs to quote ; it 's utterly hilarious . 
  could * anything * be * any more * american ? 
  lucky he was n't allowed to carry though , or those two young men would now no doubt have to be described as `` dead '' rather than merely `` bewildered '' !, 
  what exactly blows you away about it ? 
  while i may only profess to being a culturally ( as opposed to practising ) christian , coming from an anglican background i can immediately identify both their meaning and its origins in the historical context . 
  and maybe us pizza is the one true pizza , though tbh that might be over-egging the pudding a tad ... 
  no , i do n't pretend to be an active christian , but my family background is anglican . 
  as i said : culturally christian . 
  it just means we celebrate christian holidays , nothing to do with church though . 
  lol , i guess so ; however , as you say i 'm quite sure they 're the only ones who give a damn . 
  ( oops , probably just offended them again ... ),
