  interesting . 
  if there was a peace agreement in place then why would the palestinians seek or accept weapons ? 
  why are they , in your opinion , so different from jordan and egypt , with whom you acknowledge everything has worked out ? 
  the answer to hamas is to destroy their raison d'\u00eatre , destroying an insurgency military is nearly impossible . 
  what we have going on here is the classic israel/palestine chicken and the egg argument . 
  both sides will ultimately have to make concessions , but one side has to be the first . 
  why not israel ? 
  the palestinians ( pa ) have already agreed to most of israel 's conditions in principle , yet the process is frozen : is peace and long-term security not worth more than some fundamentalist politician 's rhetorical position at this point ? 
  i do n't consider israel primitive , just that the tribalism is in and of itself primitivistic . 
  i can understand its origin , but do feel it is becoming self-defeating . 
  with regards to both that and ( partially ) the problem of people like bennett and his the jewish home party colleagues , may i point to this toi blog post which i read in r/israel : http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/shutting-down-the-start-up-nation/, 
  i say partially because there are two more specific points i would like to raise independently about bennett et al :, 
  1 ) a nation 's education minister can either do a great deal of good or harm within that role alone, 
  2 ) he is not alone in the key inner cabinet , with shaked , liberman ( not tjhp , but very right-wing ) and ariel all also holding influential roles , disproportionate to the number of knesset seats they actually hold . 
  i guess we shall have to agree to disagree , interesting conversation though . 
  it 's not ancient , although the idea is and attempts were made during the greek and roman eras to dig it . 
  there was an ancient greek paved way for hauling ships over the isthmus to avoid the need to sail around the peloponnese , which is the diolkos mentioned in the title , although the diolkos is not visible from the bridge where this photo was taken . 
  the canal as seen here was finally dug in the last couple of decades of the 19th century ; however , even by the time it was finished it was too narrow for modern ships and now is mainly traversed by pleasure craft as seen in the picture . 
  so smug ignorance in a single thread . 
  awe inspiring , in its own special way . 
  yep , ie one whose name in english ends with `` day '' ... 
  settlement expansion . 
  crack is readily available in london , so much so that it * must * be popular to a fairly great extent ; i have met a lot of people who smoke it or have smoked it there . 
  i am not a crackhead myself ( my doc being pot and/or scotch ) and i do n't even live in the uk either , so that 's not a matter of social circles . 
  not as popular as powder coke , which is very popular in london , but then it never is except in certain poor communities afaik . 
  also , in australia , while meth is a problem in rural areas , it is a positive scourge in the suburbs . 
  not disagreeing with your overall argument , just pointing this out . 
  do you mean in the sense of israel hubristically expecting there will never be any blowback ? 
  israel has always been open about providing humanitarian aid to wounded individuals who cross its borders seeking such , and equally so about not restricting the subsequent movement of these fighters , so long ( of course ) as they are not affiliated with groups in conflict with israel . 
  al-nusrah fighters are well known to be the primary beneficiaries of medical treatment provided in this manner . 
  there is nothing controversial in any of this afaik . 
  check out [ whitey bulger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whitey_bulger ) here . 
  i wonder if he feels the same way about al-queda , or if he 's just a plain old american when * that * comes up ? 
  i love how he uses his * irishness * to perpetuate the type of `` all oirish are alcoholics to be sure , to be sure '' bs that the irish blokes i know who are actually from , you know , ireland consider racist slurs too ... 
  i did n't say anything about `` conspiring '' though , did i ? 
  the treatment of al-nusrah fighters has * never * been denied by israel , which is literally all i discussed . 
  so why the reflex downvoted ? 
  in fact , where does the article mention a `` conspiracy '' even ? 
  it just says that the * chief of mossad * is happy to admit this `` humanitarian aid '' is provided in the manner it is because it aligns with israel 's ( perceived ) strategic interests . 
  so tell me , according to you , is the * chief of mossad * an anti-semite ? 
  it literally states that this behaviour is inline with current us policy in the region . 
  how then is that a case of `` they 're not really with us , they 're working against us '' ? 
  i think your anti-semitism senses are working overtime here . 
  here 's something that might surprise you : not * all * of weatern society is anti-semitic ... 
  furthermore , it is quite possible to objectively discuss israeli policy without there being any anti-semiitic animus driving the discussion . 
  you did n't answer my question ; do you think the chief of mossad is anti-semitic ( or is it just the people who quote him ) ? 
  do you dispute that israel has a treat and release policy with al-nusrah fighters ? 
  hold on a second , you have n't answered * any * of my counterpoints . 
  why not ? 
  i 'm quite aware of the history of anti-semitism in all its ugliness and grotesque manipulations ; i just do n't see exactly how this article fits that awful history except in the loosest sense that it is implicitly critical of israeli policy . 
  critical of israeli policy is not , however , ipso facto anti-semitism . 
  or do you think it is ? 
  this does n't say * anything * about `` the jews '' ... 
  conflation of israel and the jewish people is , in and of itself , considered anti-semitism : does n't what you just said make * you * an anti-semite ? 
  well then , perhaps your interpretation of this article is wrong too ? 
  in any case , is n't israel 's posture towards syria ( as with hezbollah , or egypt in ' 67 ) considered justified by the fact the countries are still at war , technically at least ? 
  i know i have read such sentiments regularly here . 
  again , i ask you to address my questions : is israel treating and releasing al-nusrah fighters and do you consider the chief of mossad an anti-semite ? 
  i did , but they are irrelevant to this piece . 
  i take it you are effectively admitting you consider any and all discussion of israeli policy anti-semitism then , seeing as you wo n't answer any of my very simple yes or no answer questions . 
  seppo culture generally , to the point i hesitate to even apply the word to it . 
  jfk, 
  naftali bennet in action, 
  i mean i feel bad for you guys , but it 's funny af to watch from the sidelines . 
  does n't [ wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_raids_on_australia,_1942%e2%80%9343 ) count ? 
  you should invent those cocktails , made with jim beam and arak maybe ? 
  the howls of protest would be something to behold . 
  he means one of his fork spiker thingies is not the same longness as the uvvers , bruvver, 
  well , israel neither confirms nor denies any of this , but the evidence points to [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vela_incident ) . 
  no , they have very clear meanings still . 
  a woman . 
  well-balanced and sober reportage of the situation in which israel threatens destruction not only for its enemies , but instead for * everyone * if they feel threatened , as in '73 when twenty nuclear weapons were prepared for use . 
  this was used to blackmail the us into sending weapons israel wanted * immediately * rather than at their own discretion . 
  it is believed those nukes would have been used not only to attack their enemy , egypt , but also soviet ( and probably us/nato ) targets . 
  why ? 
  to trigger wwiii . 
  everyone else 's mad is if you attack me , i will destroy you too . 
  israel 's is if anyone attacks us , we 'll attack everyone . 
  meanwhile , israel has just used the iran deal that frees the iranian people from the shackles of sanction-caused poverty to demand the biggest ever us military aid package ever . 
  remember , iran has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and never built or tested a nuclear weapon , while israel possesses hundreds and refuses to sign the treaty !, 
  me too !, 
  high-five guys !, 
  that 's so cool he 's finally been banned , at least from his main hate-speech account if not all his sock-puppets . 
  justice does exist . 
  not having seen his particularly stinky piles of crap in r/worldnews for sometime i wondered if he , like others of his ilk , had perhaps had a moment of clarity , realised his lies and bigotry were not being swallowed whole ( as he demands ) , and so just rage quit ; however a ban makes so much more sense as i think a moment of clarity really is ** not ** his style . 
  in fact , to be frank , u/tayaravaknin must be quite the least self-aware pro-israeli-bigotbot account on reddit , and is , i had always previously believed and now do again , quite incapable of such acceptance of facts ( `` facts ? 
  ugh , facts are gross - here swallow this steaming pile of bullshit instead ... '' - u/tayaravaknin ) . 
  some of his comments were at least humorous , if in a very grim sense ( eg `` the palestinians are imposing an apartheid regime on the poor israelis in the wb '' ; `` the palestinians do n't want peace so their kids can grow up , they just want to kil jews at any cost '' and other such hysterical nonsense * is * funny , but also profoundly disturbing , and clearly indicative of how disturbed israeli-extremist thought processes actually are ... ) , which i will miss , but overall he was more turgid than amusing with his endless posts which ignored morality , legality and even reality in favour of blindly spewing out the israeli propaganda party-line . 
  it 's funny how he supports that venal witch , hillary clinton , too . 
  i do n't think trump is any way a good presidential candidate except two :, 
  1 ) he 's ** not ** shillary ( `` the most corrupt lizard-person in the world '' ) clinton ;, 
  2 ) u/tayaravaknin wo n't vote for him !, 
  it 's so funny how he moderates all those ironically titled `` against hate speech '' type subs , when he is a primary purveyor of hate-speech on this site . 
  it 's lucky he lacks any sense of irony , or his head would no doubt implode under the stress . 
  well , lucky for him , if not anyone else . 
  one last point : if he is * such * the pro-zionist zealot , why does n't he make aaliyah and serve in the idf instead of hiding in america and just being an internet tough guy ? 
  i have asked him this before , as have others - including israelis - yet he has still never provided a cogent answer . 
  he expects other israeli kids to both kill and die enforcing his ideological beliefs in gaza and the wb , but wo n't do so himself ... 
  speaks volumes , does n't it . 
  ( for the record , he basically claims his keyboard warrior work is more important than that of actual soldiers .
