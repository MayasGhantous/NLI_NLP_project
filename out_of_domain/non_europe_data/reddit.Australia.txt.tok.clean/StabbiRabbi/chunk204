  white cops are n't real people either . 
  there 's a great [ documentary series about it actually ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbcbwp6ibr4 ) . 
  do you believe that allying the philippines with china will prevent china from laying claim to the areas of the scs that both nations are contesting ? 
  while i could see a closer relationship perhaps turning down the level of physical confrontation , i doubt that duerte can offer china anything they value more than the spratly islands , which is where chinese and filipino naval forces have clashed . 
  the chinese point blank refused to accept the recent arbitration over this issue , a position i really can not see them changing . 
  first off , please accept my apology for having worded my comment that your * question * was deluded or disingenuous such that you feel it was `` name-calling '' . 
  that was not my intent , i did actually mean the question and not * you * . 
  in this sub i think we should all try to rise above attacking one another personally and i certainly did n't mean to make you feel as though that was my intent . 
  wrt to jabotinsky `` not being a leader of irgun '' you just contradicted yourself again , saying :, 
   *** jabotinsky was the founder and leader of betar *** ... *** betar and irgun ... joined forces to launch attacks *** after this occurred . 
  that still makes him a both a terrorist and specifically a leader of irgun by any reasonable definition !, 
  you have n't even touched [ his association with fascism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betar_naval_academy#mussolini_and_the_revisionists ) either , i notice , despite it having been raised not only by me , but also by u/l1terally _ jabotinsky, 
  in the link to my comment you provided i said nothing about any leaders of hamas and the pa. 
  i was specifically discussing abdullah abu rahma - a leader of the bil ` in community , * not * hamas or fatah . 
  he is widely recognised as being `` gandhian '' in his approach , as he favours non-violent resistance . 
  for the record , i do not condone to any degree the glorification of violence by either side - not by the palestinians nor by israelis . 
  the celebration of the munich attacks is quite as shameful as the installation of the plaque honouring the kdh terrorists and i despise both actions equally . 
  is that clear enough ? 
  on the other hand , you not only absolutely * refuse * to condemn the manifest crimes of zionist/israeli terrorists , but instead offer up apologia upon apologia for them about how great they were and how * their * attacks were n't terrorism . 
  in fact , you mulishly refuse to even acknowledge that they are terrorists , let alone that they should be censured for these acts ( though not , i can perhaps accept , their later careers - even despite the fact they never renounced violence ) . 
  i discuss the issue of zionists terrorists ' place of honour in israel because it is quite impossible to respond to your posted question of `` how can israel treat the pa as a ` peace partner ' when they continue to glorify acts of terrorism '' without dealing with the elephant in the room : that israel 's polity and israeli society behaves in the exact same manner . 
  it is especially jarring that you continue to excuse these bestial thugs even as you expect everyone to agree that yes , it 's all the palestinians ' fault ... 
  your accusation of hypocrisy rings entirely hollow and bitterly ironic given the context and content of your replies . 
  that is certainly something duterte must consider , but the vice versa is equally true , especially if tensions between the us and china ratchet up at any point ... 
  i definitely agree he has to tread a fine line though . 
   what a wonderful example of the abuse of quotes by selectively removing relevant information . 
  wtf man ? 
  all i removed was :, 
   until he was banned from return to the mandate area and shifted fully into politics in 1930, 
  i removed it for conciseness , and precisely because those words do not change the substance an iota . 
  you are just spraying out aggressive responses to arguments you can not with reason , fact or morality . 
  the rest of your post is similarly just grasping at straws and attempted semantic distraction from the real points raised . 
  furthermore , you hold me to different standards to those you expect to be held to , exactly as you do with israeli terrorists vs palestinians . 
  eg , you have singularly failed to support any of your `` refutations '' . 
  you just saying i 'm wrong does not make me wrong , and it hubristic of you to believe it does . 
  in actual fact you have neither proved nor disproved anything , despite your blustering to the contrary . 
  ... as do israel . 
  as well as israeli society still celebrating the vile zionist terror gang leaders ( such as jabotinsky , sharon , shamir and begin and as discussed above ) , irgun and stern gang members still get state pensions in israel . 
  this is nominally because those organisations were absorbed into the idf , but if israel wishes to take the moral high-ground they must first disavow these evil men and cut them loose , dishonouring them and their memory . 
  sigh , smh ... 
   [ to cite just one example of many , in july 2006 a plaque was unveiled in jerusalem 's king david hotel honoring the men of the irgun terrorist group who bombed the hotel in 1948 , killing 92 people ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/opinion/la-oew-hazou26-2010mar26 ) . 
  contrary to your claim , [ jabotinsky is listed as supreme commander of irgun 1937-1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irgun#structure.2c_command.2c_and_organization ) , long after you claim he was no longer leader in 1930 . 
  what do you mean you 're not going to resort to ad hominems ? 
  too late for that . 
  i will provide the link again , trying parsing instead of skimming this time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betar_naval_academy, 
  * one * meeting did not take place between mussolini and jabotinsky , but the strong links between the betar leaders at the academy and the fascists are clearly detailed . 
  then there is this , jabotinsky 's own impassioned defence of fascism in sn april 11 , 1935 article , `` jews and fascism : some remarks - and a warning '' , for new york 's jewish daily bulletin . 
   `` whatever any few think of fascism 's other points , there is no doubt that the italian brand of fascist ideology is at least an ideology of racial equality . 
  let us not be so humble as to pretend that this does not matter -- that racial equality is too insignificant an idea to outbalance the absence of civic freedom . 
  for it is not true . 
  i am a journalist who would choke without freedom of the press , but i affirm it is simply blasphemous to say that in the scale of civic rights , even the freedom of the press comes before the equality of all men . 
  equality comes first , always first , super first ; and jews should remember it , and hold that a regime maintaining that principle in a world turned cannibal does , partly , but considerably , atone for its other short-comings : it may be criticized , it should not be kicked at . '', 
  you misinterpret the telegraph article to support your own tottering tower of cognitive dissonance , but the [ la times article ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/opinion/la-oew-hazou26-2010mar26 ) i have also provided allows you no such wriggle room . 
  what ad hominem attacks have * i * launched on * you * ? 
  if you must split hairs , then fine : i condemn both palestinian and zionist terrorists equally . 
  now , where is your universal denouncement of terrorism ? 
  you are simply playing stupid games of semantics and distraction because you simply can not refute the truth of what i have said . 
  if you read that plaque it blames the victims rather than the attackers !, 
  it had to be changed because it was such a gross piece of apologia it could not be tolerated :, 
  by not explicity condemning them , it implicitly honours them . 
  the entire world views the plaque as an affront to human decency , as evidenced by the british outrage and the reportage in the la times article ( both of which you are simply ignoring , blindly ) . 
  so no . 
  so what you 're saying is the the irgun and likud are the fascists , not jabotinsky ? 
  i suppose this picture was taken from a training exercise for forcible entry scenarios ? 
  sounds like a vampire bite to me . 
  have you been craving blood more than usual since you first noticed them appear ? 
  yeah , not gay , but i can see how it would be easier for those who are to try to mask it and avoid dealing with confrontation ... 
  being proud of who you are though is important , not just for personal reasons , but for others in the same boat . 
  if it draws undeserved crap from bigots at times , well that simply makes it more important . 
  i explicitly condemned all terrorism in a previous reply . 
  you 're not even trying to make it look like you 're being honest at this point . 
  and , given the unapologetically biased sources you supplied for this post , you are scarcely in any position to criticise anyone else 's sources itt . 
  read through all the replies , i explicitly condemned it it response to your not-picking semantic bullshit , such that not even you could possibly fail to interpret it correctly , no matter how hard you try ... 
  is this all * you * have left , lol ? 
  still waiting for * your * unequivocal rejection of all terrorism and terrorists btw ( jabotinsky included please ) ... 
  yep , hill is becoming an f-35 base . 
  the 34th fs who were the first squadron to achieve ioc with the f-35a are a hill squadron . 
  it 's most probably not a d model agm-65 , but a new version . 
  the maverick is enjoying a lot of use again ( regularly being seen on usn f/a -18 s flying against isis ) , but with [ new seekers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-65_maverick ) :, 
   the most modern versions of the maverick are the agm-65h / k , which were in production as of 2007 . 
  [ 1 ] the agm-65h was developed by coupling the agm-65b with a charge-coupled device ( ccd ) seeker optimized for desert operations and which has three times the range of the original tv-sensor ; [ 2 ] [ 13 ] a parallel usn program aimed at rebuilding agm-65fs with newer ccd seekers resulted in the agm-65j . 
  [ 2 ] the agm-65k , meanwhile , was developed by replacing the agm-65g 's ir guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system . 
  luke is the main f-35a training centre , with lots of foreign crews being trained and working out tactics together there along with the usaf guys ( eg raaf , rnaf , etc. . . ; f-35b operators such as the usmc/raf are training elsewhere , perhaps mcas beaufort iirc ? 
  ; both f-35cs and f-35bs - usn , usmc , raf - are being tested at pax river and the frs for f-35c pilots oceana so i guess that is the usn training centre ? ) . 
  in fact , the above-mentioned 34th fs ` hl ' f-35as are on a tdy deployment to luke at the moment afaik ( they definitely were recently , though it may be over by now i believe it 's still running ) . 
  i think it is holloway which will replace luke as the main viper training centre , as luke transitions to f-35as . 
  iirc the plan is to base six f-35a squadrons at luke , hence the need for the vipers to move - there simply is n't the ramp space for both types . 
  edit : added maverick details and link . 
   holloman *, 
  holloway is a place in london - i 'm an aussie born in the uk and i got the names twisted up ... 
  yeah , i just meant one often sees pics of usn hornets/super hornets launching from carriers against isis with mavericks hung underneath their wings , not the specific version . 
  do you know whether they use the agm-65ks mentioned by the wikipedia article too though ? 
  or was that a bit of an evolutionary dead-end ? 
  he he , at least you guys can laugh about it . 
  holloman is a pretty key base though , what with your raptors alone , but also the european contingent and now the viper training !, 
  and of course , the f-117a nighthawks used to have that ` ho ' tailcode too ... 
  italian names are similar in that most which end with an ` a ' are female names , but there are a couple of men 's names that do too . 
  with the ` ka ' suffix you mention below , is n't that a diminutive which makes the name into an affectionate version ? 
  that 's certainly the case in other slavic cultures .
