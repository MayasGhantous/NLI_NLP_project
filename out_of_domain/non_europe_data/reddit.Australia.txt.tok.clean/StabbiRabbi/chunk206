    why does he have to abandon his culture, 
   he does n't , and fuck you for suggesting that 's what i 'm saying, 
  but wait :, 
   he should abandon any beliefs that are demonstrably untrue, 
  lol , ok buddy . 
  sounds like someone needs a nap . 
  that 's a nice clear view of the superbug planform . 
  i ca n't wait till we get our growlers too , they will give raaf a regionally unmatched capability and allow us to leverage all of the other combat platforms we operate to their best advantage .

  do n't canadians too ? 
  their own one , but they still celebrate thanksgiving , do n't they ? 
  your work looks ... fun ... 
   fiduciary duty, 
  those words do not mean what he seems to think they mean . 
  the whole american `` tax is theft '' attitude just baffles me . 
  it is , of course , one of the root causes of their appalling healthcare situation , as the belief that `` your '' tax dollars healing someone else is somehow immoral is a primary root cause of their lack of universal healthcare . 
  if enough americans think like this and do everything they can to dodge taxes they can be the next greece !, 
  do these count as furries ? 
  * the usual suspects *, 
  tell that to certain `` democracies '' in the me who take the eye-for-an-eye principle and convert it to your-whole-fucking-head-for-an-eye ... 
  that 's fucking spooky , man . 
  x-post to r/creepy !, 
  i was thinking of a colonialist state in the me actually ... 
   i said nothing of the sort and you 're being rather rude . 
  this kind of comment , treating every american like their lowest common denominator , is the exact wrong attitude to have if you want this sub to thrive with a variety of viewpoints . 
  love this quote of his further down ; the sub is r/askeurope , so i do n't see why he thinks his * first amendment rights * are so important to that sub in particular ... 
  i have definitely noticed that in european cities too - there are more people just out and about , hanging out in the city centre and drinking coffee , beer or whatever with family and friends . 
  i was recently in croatia and bosnia and it 's particularly noticeable in those mediterranean cultures , though by no means unique to them . 
  i have ( distant ) cousins in croatia and spent some time with them and it is definitely a different dynamic from that one experiences here . 
  very relaxed and natural just chilling without any overt/specific motivation for doing so other than to do so , whereas here we tend to meet specifically for a reason - even if that reason is just to catch up . 
  great , see ya ... 
  [ another girl another planet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvo7hnqpfri ) by the only ones, 
  except for those us weapons manufacturers ' cash flow problems . 
  oh wait , those guys do n't have cash flow problems anyway . 
  my mistake , you had it right ... 
  idk if i agree with the expense aspect , as the average income in croatia ( to continue with my examples ) is considerably lower than ours , with bosnia being even poorer . 
  i * definitely * agree with your point about the design of cities 100 % , and the cafe culture point too though . 
  that square was originally built as part of the palace of a western roman emperor ( diocletian ) , then repurposed in the middle ages , but it 's not just that it 's a beautiful old space with polished marble pavement that draws people : it 's the variety of bars , restaurants and cafes together with the way people will just hang out in those establishments that is most different from australian towns and cities . 
  the rules and regulations are much more relaxed regarding licensing for a start , and people have a different attitude as the space is much more inviting . 
  population density is another factor , in europe a lot more people live in apartments which means a ) people have less space to chill at home , making going out more attractive ; b ) more people live close to the city centre ( ie walking distance , or a couple of bus stops , instead of having to drive ) & c ) together these two factors work to create the critical mass of customers for all the bars/cafes/etc and people to create atmosphere necessary . 
  i think the aussie obsession with a block in the ` burbs ( as opposed to being open to living in apartments ) is really quite isolating in and of itself , both psychologically and physically . 
  until that changes further ( as it already is ) , we are stuck with a chicken and the egg situation where the spaces are not inviting so people do n't come and because people do n't go there is insufficient impetus to change the spaces to make them more inviting ... 
  i think these things are getting better , but wish they 'd hurry up . 
  i live in a unit quite close to the city , something i take advantage of , but obviously we need more people to do so for things to change more rapidly . 
  i 'm a massive fan of james ellroy , who i have seen mentioned here - just not nearly as much as i feel he deserves . 
  the same goes for the late , great elmore leonard while we 're on us `` crime '' writers . 
  sticking with the detective-type books , philip kerr is a great author who i do n't think i have seen mentioned at all . 
  for something entirely different i would recommend dbc pierre , whose books are all different from each other in most regards , except for how much i enjoyed them . 
  this is such a dumb trope , i ca n't believe they all buy into it so much . 
  i guess blaming the world , instead of your own nation 's establishment , for being parasites is just a much less bitter pill for them to swallow ... 
  just how tiny does he think the uk is ? 
  and how long does he think police chases go on for anyway ? 
  if they literally lasted for hours then the probability of most ending in * someone 's * death would be damn near 100 % ... 
  i spent my childhood in the uk and when friends from there come here to visit they remark on that exact issue ; in the uk it 's almost always possible to walk to the pub , whereas here it 's scarcely ever an option ... 
  could n't agree more with the entirety of your second paragraph . 
  we * do * have some great public spaces , it just seems we ( as a culture/society ) have n't figured out the best way to make use of them . 
  that 's a pretty good deal , whether you have already read them or not . 
  maybe it will still be there next time you pass ? 
  yeah , he 's great is n't he ? 
  excellent writing and some great plots . 
  it 's very obvious why it is so many of his books have been made into movies . 
  makes it sound just like ` nam ...

  you ca n't swing at plitvice , but you can at krka , which is another national park with amazing waterfalls a bit closer to split . 
  i went swimming there last month , and the water is lovely .

  it 's really lovely , definitely worth a visit . 
  i have been to both and while plitvice is massive and just `` wow '' , krka is beautiful too .

  nice restaurants downstream , and activities like kayaking , rock climbing and these flying foxes across the gorge , which i did n't do , but look amazing .

  ioc is initial operating capability , it describes when a new weapon system is first able to be used operationally even if it does n't yet possess its full set of capabilities . 
  for example the f-35a just achieved ioc , which means it is able to fly missions even though it is not yet able to field all weapons and etc. 
  being able to be used operationally also refers to the ability to be maintained and sustained through operations .

  lmgtfy is let me google that for you . 
  it 's a website where you type in a search and then copy the url it generates , so then when someone has asked a question you may just send them the link to lmgtfy . 
  when they click the lmgtfy link , it takes them to a page that looks like google and then fills in the search box , clicks the search button and says `` that was n't so hard '' or something . 
  it 's a way of saying to people `` here 's how easy that question was to answer '' . 
  here 's an example : http://lmgtfy.com/?q=seal+copypasta+, 
  so you see , it 's just a kind of passive aggressive way of saying `` do the search , man '' .
