  uh , with pot i believe the technical word is * stash * . 
  it should be an `` extraordinary stash '' . . 
  nope , pretty sure she 's a kitten ... 
  which means you won , right ? 
  well , as i 'm sure you known , until 1989 berlin was divided into east and west zones , with the berlin wall separating them . 
  in the east they used gas powered street lights , whereas west berlin used electric . 
  the gas lights give the softer yellow glow , so the change in colour essentially shows the demarcation . 
  [ here 's a news story with more detail from when the picture was taken from the iss and published by the crew ( which included chris hadfield , much beloved of reddit for his great pics/ama/bowie cover versions , at the time ) ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10003467/berlin-satellite-image-reveals-stark-east-west-divisions.html ) . 
  ^ ^ * dumb, 
  i like the subtle interplay of its component elements and how nuanced it is as a piece of art . 
  that 's $ 120 aud so under $ 80 usd . 
  booze is expensive here though . 
  i am sure it 's not that much in the us . 
  yes , the taxiing of aircraft in formation to prepare for a minimum interval take-off . 
  in texas the answer is , i believe , a simple `` yes '' . 
  diversity proven . 
  canadians are so backwards . 
  some of them worship maple syrup and there is a cult based around some god called tim horton , or so i 've heard . 
  which time ? 
  oh , that 's right . 
  every single fucking time . 
  and yet listen to israelis and they bleat about how * they 're * the ones deprived of a `` partner for peace '' ... 
  i hate hypocrites . 
  sanctions against settlers and israeli leaders , as per the russian model , would be a great start . 
  no need to punish the whole country . 
  yet . 
  israel will anyway , lol . 
  i bet as soon as the first f-35i lands in israel they plaaf will be all over it . 
  that 's what happened with the `` lavi '' ( ie f-16 in a new skin ) and pac-2 patriot sam , both of which were post-egypt peace deal bribery commencement weapons systems . 
  [ link to article discussing the vehicle ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2016/10/general-dynamics-griffin-dont-call-it-a-tank-its-totally-a-tank/ ) , as recently debuted . 
  black box data dude , more reliable and detailed than a pilot 's account anyway . 
  like how netanyahu is the direct political descendent of the truly evil menachem begin , likud 's founder and former irgun terrorist leader , who he has not disavowed in any way , but in fact [ actually praises ] ( http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=3294 ) ? 
  indeed , there is a [ long list ] ( http://www.thehypertexts.com/israeli%20prime%20ministers%20terrorists%20nakba.htm ) of `` former '' zionist terrorists who went on to make up israel 's polity and are still well-regarded in israel despite being terrorists . 
  [ jabotinsky is the most popular street name is israel ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) , a celebration of a man who was not only a terorist , but who had [ ties to italian fascism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betar_naval_academy#mussolini_and_the_revisionists ) on top !, 
   membership and service in lehi [ the stern gang ] were subsequently recognized by the state , and former members were given pensions, 
  or how the king david hotel atrocity was [ celebrated with a plaque ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/opinion/la-oew-hazou26-2010mar26 ) ( which had to have its text changed because it blamed the victims while not attaching any opprobrium to the vicious terrorist who committed the attack ) ? 
  finally , let me just leave this haaretz discussion of israel 's hallowed leaders and their terroristic pasts : http://www.haaretz.com/are-begin-and-shamir-also-considered-terrorists-1.369342, 
  universal power adapters are so handy when you travel , as opposed to specific country adapters . 
  i have another type which has sections you pull apart and assemble to achieve the specific combination you need , but i must say this look more sturdy and simpler to operate . 
  i will definitely be looking out for one of these , it looks like a good , solid solution to the problem . 
  nothing worse than having your electronics dead because you ca n't use the sockets !, 
  tbf , even disregarding the flash kit , these guys * do * look much more squared away than most of the pictures i have seen of ana troops in the past . 
  oh definitely . 
  it kind of reminds me of the arvn which had some excellent units , yet as a whole the army eventually buckled after the support was withheld and the nva made its final offensive . 
  this scenario is exactly what the isaf nations need to avoid in afghanistan . 
   `` this is an area that agents , regulatory bodies and industry associations need to come together on to ensure the best outcome for home buyers , '' mr jovanovic said . 
  if only he 'd shown that level of concern for home buyers and their outcomes * before * it went to court he would have saved $ 330k . 
  still , i 'm sure he 'll find some way of gouging it back . 
  real estate agents are masters at that kind of thing . 
  do n't forget ig farben , one of the most egregious offenders from the german business world ... 
  of course they split into subdivisions and changed name , but agfa , basf , bayer and sanofi are all direct descendents of the original ig farben company . 
  i think you may be getting different products that share a name mixed up there . 
  this is n't something i consciously remember , so all i can do here is provide some ballpark , typical numbers . 
  i live in perth , western australia , where a pint of beer is always more the $ 10 aud anywhere in the city , and sometimes up to about $ 17 . 
  i do n't actually tend to drink much beer these days , but i do enjoy nice rums , which can easily be $ 30 - $ 40 a glass in the rum bars . 
  that being said , the most expensive drinks i have had would probably be well-aged scotches bought in bars to help me decide whether or not i like a particular expression enough to buy a bottle which can easily run to $ 40 or so . 
  * maybe * some glasses of wine i have had in restaurants would pip those prices slightly , once one divides the bottle into glasses , but it 's hard to work that out as bottles of wine do n't typically end up being poured in perfectly even measures . 
  it certainly does smack of the trump `` user pays '' model of american military `` assistance '' , does n't it ? 
  i see you 've dealt with estate agents before too . 
  i does somewhat , does n't it ? 
  the concept is similar too , in that the aim is to leverage a common base for a family of different afvs ... 
  that 's the $ b question , is n't it , and a subject on which countless papers and books have been written . 
  ultimately , the answer has less to do with equipment , or even training , and more to do with getting them to buy in to the idea of loyalty to `` afghanistan '' , not to their own ethnic/sectarian/tribal / family group , so they are motivated to fight against warlords/the taliban . 
  the way to do that is to demonstrate that the kabul government is itself not loyal only to * its * own tribal/ethnic/sectarian / family groups , is able to provide security and is functioning to improve the lot of the afghan people . 
  for the government to prove that though it needs breathing space from the warlords/taliban which it must rely on the army ( and currently isaf ) to provide . 
  this is obviously a bit of a chicken and the egg type circular scenario , which is why the west is * still * providing `` security assistance '' and training . 
  for this to not all just be a wasted effort , however , the government first needs to root out corruption within itself . 
  if that does n't happen then the rest ca n't possibly follow on . 
  so , no silver bullet or quick answers ... 
  definitely . 
  it 's also why instead of aiming for revolutionary systems a push for evolutionary systems that capitalise on , share and leverage existing technologies ( such as this vehicle espouses ) also makes much more sense . 
  a great example is combat aircraft development : look at the relative success of the advanced sukhois ( or the super hornet ) compared to the issues the f-35 program has had to deal with . 
  i 'm not saying that the f-35 wo n't be great when it 's done , but rather that the project has taken a difficult path to get there . 
  this is why the usaf 's b-21 program 's talk of following a model which leverages existing tech is very encouraging imo . 
  one area of hope is the country 's natural resources ; however , they ca n't be exploited until both security and corruption are at least adequately under control . 
  once they can be though the influx of wealth could be a great driver of change through wealth and quality of life . 
  of course , this has been understood for a long time without yet being realised in practical terms ... 
  everyone thinks they 're mean dogs , but they 're just big sooks . 
  really smart too . 
   i do n't even know some of those words, 
  you can claim english as your first language , but i do n't think claiming fluency is warranted . 
  nice fairy story , but not * quite * the objective truth , is it ? 
  you just left a lot out , such as how the partition was completely unfair in demographic terms . 
  indeed you make it sound as though the pre-zionist-illegal-immigration populations were somewhat similar in size when in reality the jewish part of the population was relatively tiny . 
  you also make it sound as though everyone just stayed where they were , lying by omission about the massive population transfer that took place due to the zionists starting a war when they illegally unilaterally declared `` independence '' to take `` their '' parts of palestine . 
  indeed , you also omitted the fact it was a zionist terror campaign which made the british decide to leave the area in chaos instead of effecting an orderly transition as happened most other places formerly part of the british empire . 
  you also completely ignore the moral aspects of who the traditional inhabitants of most of palestine were and how their rights were entirely subsumed for the gain of the ( illegal immigrant ) colonists . 
  especially post-israel 's '67 war of territorial expansion , which is really what i find objectionable . 
  overall , my issue is you make the zionists/israel sound benign and reasonable , especially compared to the wicked arabs , whereas the truth is both sides committed acts both good and bad , reasonable and unreasonable , fair and vicious . 
  finally you make it sound as though the ongoing conflict is the palestinians ' fault , which is far from the truth - as the very article under discussion here illustrates . 
  saying that the palestinians ( you do n't even use their proper name , choosing arab throughout as though all arabs are an undifferentiated mass - another israeli lie in and of itself ) are hateful and the israelis are n't is just bullshit . 
  i am personally a zionist , as in i believe entirely in israel 's right to exist as a home for jews in peace and security and enjoying self-determination , but i can not in good conscience ignore the price exacted on the native palestinians for this to have been made possible or israel 's egregious crimes in the occupied territories as you are clearly so happy to blithely do . 
  i 'm not upset about it , i just thought it was interesting , which is why i posted it . 
  i did n't get to meet him , my folks did when they were in georgia recently , but they said he was absolutely gorgeous !, 
  apparently the owner picked him up and his head was over their shoulder while his body covered the entirety of the owner 's torse !, 
  georgian shepherds ( and caucasian shepherds generally ) grow up to be big , big dogs who are generally working dogs though , and not always entirely suitable as pets . 
  their instincts are to protect the flock from wolves up in the mountains and that protective instinct carries over to their human family when kept as pets ; this is fine within the family , but can make life for visitors `` interesting '' shall we say ... 
  that could be scary - [ this is a full grown georgian shepherd ] ( https://www.animalhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/georgian-shepherd.jpg ) !, 
  ah cool , no worries . 
  i agree with your point btw .
