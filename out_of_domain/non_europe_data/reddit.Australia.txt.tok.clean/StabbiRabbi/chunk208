  i think so too . 
  sad story though : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roza_shanina, 
  the navy has a bit of a strike fighter shortage at the moment ( so i have read ) , so i guess when they are [ pulling f/a -18 cs from the boneyard and regenerating them for the marines ] ( https://news.usni.org/2016/06/23/marines-hornets-from-boneyard ) to use in frontline service it makes sense for these squadrons to take whatever they can . 
  [ blue angels are having super hornets modified for them at the moment ] ( http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2016/07/blue-angels-super-hornets.html ) though , so soon these will be the oldest then . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/5457/us-navy-adversary-hornet-emerges-wearing-russias-latest-combat-jet-scheme ), 
  this photo comes from the [ site of mark miller ] ( http://specialforces78.com/members-pages/mark-miller/ ) who served with [ e company ( lrp ) 20th infantry ( abn ) ] ( http://www.75thrra.com/history/c75_hx.html ) . 
  e company ( lrp ) 20th infantry ( abn ) ( later renamed c company ( ranger ) 75th infantry ( abn ) ) was the long range patrol company directly assigned to [ first field force vietnam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_field_force,_vietnam ) , which was the [ military assistance command vietnam ( macv ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_assistance_command,_vietnam ) corps level command with responsibility for the republic of vietnam 's [ ii corps tactical zone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ii_corps_tactical_zone ) , an area that primarily consisted of the crucial central highlands . 
  as a reconnaissance unit directly attached to a corps level command co e provided long range reconnaissance , surveillance , target acquisition , and special type missions on a corp level basis ( operating at very long ranges throughout the ii corps tactical zone ) . 
  in addition , the company had the capacity to operate as a platoon size force and conduct regular recon-in-force missions . 
  ( this is explained in detail in second link in the first paragraph . ), 
  e company ( lrp ) 20th infantry ( abn ) / c company ( ranger ) 75th infantry ( abn ) is a direct predecessor of the current 75th ranger regiment , of which it became a company in february 1969 when the lrp/lrrp units in vietnam were reorganised as independent companies of the 75th infantry regiment . 
  subsequently the 75th infantry was renamed 75th ranger regiment in a post-vietnam reorganisation . 
  r/israel - some full on nasty opinions are openly aired there whenever the really hardcore , extreme right-wing pro-settlement zealots come out and say what they really think . 
  obviously there are a range of opinions and some very reasonable commenters too , but if you want to understand why there 's no peace in israel/palestine go have a look . 
  just be careful what you say , they are * very * much into downvoting * any * dissenting opinions and you will likely get called a choice selection of interesting names . 
  edit : and it looks like some subscribers are here , i 've already received four downvotes . 
  dissent is *** verboten *** !!!, 
  idgaf about the downvotes , but let me emphasise it 's only a small subset of the entire user base who write the spine-chillingly bigoted stuff to which i refer . 
  nonetheless i stand by my pick : i have read some * really * , *** really *** nasty opinions in that sub . 
  i guess in one way i see what he means about racing styles ' similarities to the nations in which they are popular : us higheways ( which nascar is , the quoted op claims , mimicking ) are lined with trash too . 
  this is nice to hear about as someone who has had people close to me endure ( but luckily survive ) a brush with cancer . 
  the chemo and radiation therapy are both * extremely * exhausting and the entire experience very stressful , so any help is much appreciated by those enduring it . 
  i can imagine such acts of kindness by strangers would have a very positive effect on morale , especially for people who do n't have a close family to help them through , or whose family is already struggling to cope with what is an awful experience . 
  so ... does it happen these days at all ? 
  it 's fascinating how even though we learn more and more about stonehenge , it is still so much of a cipher . 
  the thought of why people made such long journeys is very intriguing in and of itself . 
  that is a very good book on js , a slim little volume that manages to make every page count . 
  if you read it regularly there are a lot of very strident voices opposed to any compromise who will openly state that the palestinians should all be ethnically cleansed and that the land belongs only to the jewish israelis . 
  even mainstream israeli politics are quite far-right and there are sections of the society which i would classify as extreme right wing : this really comes out in * some * of the views expressed very openly in the sub . 
  to be clear , other ( jewish israeli ) members of the sub will argue with the extremists , but as someone who genuinely supports israel and its intrinsic right to exist , enjoying self-determination and security as a ( secular ) home for jewish people it is very disturbing to read read these hardliners ' views , and even worse to see the support they * sometimes * receive . 
  otoh it is encouraging that in other instances they will get argued down , but essentially for there to be peace in israel/palestine * both * sides will have to make compromises and accept that the other has some valid arguments . 
  seeing people advocate zero compromise and absolutely refusing to accept * any * burden of responsibility for the ongoing suffering of both peoples , but especially the palestinians who live under dreadful oppression in the occupied territories of the west bank and under a very cruel blockade in gaza , while having absolutely zero pity , let alone actual empathy , for the victims of the colonial project of the settlers is quite chilling . 
  i intensely dislike extremism of any hue , nationalism and bigotry and i see these traits too often there . 
  i understand that people 's attitudes are a product of their environment , and that israelis have had to deal with some horrific shit in their lives too , but surely ending the suffering on both sides is more important than some religio-nationalist ideology winning * everything * ? 
  fwiw i 'm not some bleeding heart lefty ( counting myself centre-right , in the european/australian , non-us west sense which is a bit more centre than many us opinions ) or religiously/ethnically influenced ( ie i 'm not religious and i 'm of european descent ) - i 'm just interested in history and current affairs and this conflict is one i have developed an interest in . 
  i guess perhaps my choice seems out of place compared to some of the gory , sick subs others have posted , but if you think about it there 's not much more horrifying than a conflict which runs for many scores of years ... 
  i 'm glad you found it interesting . 
  these guys ran some hairy missions and i think their stories deserve to be heard . 
  if you 're interested , there are quite a few lrrp memoirs published now ( including some from this lrrp unit ) and they make great reading . 
  together with units like [ macv-sog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_assistance_command,_vietnam_%e2%80%93_studies_and_observations_group ) , the [ special forces ' `` greek letter '' special recon units ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconnaissance_projects ) , marine recon , navy seals and [ australian sasr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_air_service_regiment#vietnam ) these lrrp teams really set the standard for modern sof recon tactics and doctrine , which makes them fascinating in and of itself . 
  ( well , i think so at least . ), 
  it surely does . 
  it also makes for cool looking serial numbers which are usually expressed as ( for example ) 38 +33 ... ( one of the jets in this photo iirc . ), 
  ha ha , that 's nuts !, 
  i guess conspiratards gon na conspiratard though , that 's their thing after all . 
  it 's especially funny when you read the comment in here about how these are the oldest bugs in the inventory ... 
  no worries . 
  i think it 's a fascinating period , and yeah , the recce guys have the best stories a lot of the time . 
  i saw your 4th id huey resupply post earlier - another interesting shot from vietnam which i liked too . 
  yeah , i agree entirely . 
  i think i find vietnam so interesting because it was essentially half way between the wwii era and the modern military in so many senses : tactically , doctrinally and technologically . 
  a lot of the modern way of fighting wars was developed or at least first started in vietnam ; such as the use on sof , or precision guided munitions , or air assault . 
  of course the technology implementation has advanced in leaps and bounds , but the principles were first tried out then . 
  it 's also interesting in terms of the lessons it holds for people interested in modern asymmetric conflicts , which are ( currently at least ) the new normal . 
  despite that , some of the lessons of vietnam do n't seem to have stuck and similar issues are being faced . 
  of course the corollary to that is that a great many lessons * were * learned well and taken to heart , the duality of which just makes the whole subject more interesting to my mind . 
  and yeah , it does just look cool too . 
  * short attention spans, 
  that 's you trolling him now , right ? 
  the trolling in this thread is so meta . 
  i just ca n't work out half the time who is and who is n't ... 
  damnit , this article is going *** ruin *** reddit if it gets picked up by r/all . 
  you were * supposed * to go off at me for being a grammar nazi , and then explain in excruciating detail why i was wrong anyway and low attention spans is perfectly correct usage ... 
  now i 'm still hungry . 
  that was * definitely * trolling . 
  that 's what i dislike about a lot of the people to whom i refer : these unrepentant ultra-nationalists * still * wo n't actually * admit * they believe might is right and that they just dgaf . 
  they hypocritically accuse the palestinians of honouring terrorists and asking `` how can we ever be at peace with such people ? '', 
  yet they laud all the zionist terrorists of the irgun and stern gang ( who basically introduced modern political terrorism to the me ) as great men , honourable heroes whose every sin may just be ignored . 
  tbh , i would n't find it 10 % as repugnant if they just admitted they want the land and they 're going to take it instead of crying they 're the injured party and it 's the palestinians oppressing them so they just have to defend themselves . 
  at least then the conflict could be ended instead of this endless slow-motion horrorshow of creeping annexation and associated colonialist violence . 
  cool . 
  i 'm glad you 're not offended really , i was just joking coz of the topic of the article , but i was n't trying to be offensive or anything . 
  the gordon highlanders were a great regiment , and i '' sure they 're still a good battalion . 
  one of my favourite authors is [ george macdonald fraser ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_macdonald_fraser ) , most famous for the hilarious * flashman * series of comedic historical novels , and he wrote a fictionalised series about life in the gordon highlanders centred around a pvt macauslan ( the dirtiest soldier in the world ) . 
  not only are they really very funny , but they give a great picture of life in the british army immediately post-wwii . 
  he 's a pretty well regarded author , the * flashman * series is considered a classic . 
  he also wrote a factual account of his experiences as an enlisted man in burma during 1944-45 fighting the japanese . 
  all his book are worth reading imo . 
  i wonder what the , ahem , * facilities * are like ? 
  well , what i would like to know is what 's the experience of * dropping the kids at the pool * like ? 
  you know , if * your stomach hurts * ... 
  so you 'll vote for anyone , just as long as they have no experience in the role ? 
  '70s is actually correct because it 's a contraction of 1970s ... 
  it 's a pet peeve of mine too . 
  always makes me want to respond `` the 70 's * what * ? '', 
  so what happened when you ate them ? 
  easily doable . 
  just take some and invite that one friend you feel at best ambiguous about over for a bite to eat ... 
  very nice , but does it have a * convenience * for every room , or at least inside ? 
  or is that some kind of infinity * convenience * rather than a swimming pool ? 
  boy , wish i 'd listened to you . 
  seriously people , there is nothing good that comes from looking at this guy 's history , he 's horrible . 
  timur , the mongols , alexander the great , the romans . 
  algeria , egypt , syria , libya , anatolia - that 's a fair chunk of the me ... 
  they had forts at the edge of arabia , and marched into mesopotamia and parthia . 
  seashell fish & chicken in west englewood is good . 
  hey , i saw this r/perth . 
  it 's a great piece , very cleverly done - really good work !, 
  perth , western australia , not the one in scotland to make things clear for any bemused scots looking at this and thinking `` but that 's nae wor perth looks like , ken ? '', 
  action now please , enough already with the words .
