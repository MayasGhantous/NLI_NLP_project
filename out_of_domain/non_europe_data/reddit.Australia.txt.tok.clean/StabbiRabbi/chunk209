  everyone already knows israel is being a cunt in the palestine , the civilised world needs to actually intervene to end the aggression . 
  hezbollah is not on the us terrorist watchlist , why should someone associated with them not be welcomed by the us ? 
  it is only israelis who are still trying to fuel conflict with hezbollah . 
  that 's just how it works in india . 
  do n't paternalistically judge their judges with your western sjw values ... 
  edit : downvote away you fucking imperialists , india will be a superpower in 2030 and will shit on every street in your shitty country . 
  yeah , that link just takes you to the state dept homepage , proving ... nothing ? 
  here 's a link with some actual information : http://www.newsweek.com/iran-and-hezbollah-omitted-us-terror-threat-list-amid-nuclear-talks-314073, 
  they have been removed from the active threat list , exactly as i stated in the first place . 
  the eu , australia , great britain and many nations do not even rate hezbollah 's political wing as a terrorist organisation whatsoever , which supports my other assertion : that only israel is trying to cause trouble wrt to hezbollah . 
  who cares about * them * though ? 
  i sure as fuck do n't . 
  do you mean ornithology ? 
  i do n't see the problem ... 
  why do n't you want people to know it 's you ? 
  i just do n't care if they know it 's me or not , it 's no skin off mine if people see my number . 
  i do n't get any sms spam , nor nuisance calls to speak of ( i used to get some from european numbers , but i told them to stop and they did , since then nobody has bothered me and certainly not random businesses i have called . ), 
  also i do n't like answering private numbers , and do n't see why i should impose my own private number on others . 
  so what do you do then ? 
  do you * ever * deign to reveal your number ? 
  i do n't think it 's curious - even gingers * want * souls , something only allah can promise them . 
  not having as many gingers as the west , muhammadans do n't have as many social taboos against gingerism . 
  for a ginger , i imagine the seductive whisper of an isis recruiter telling them `` join * us * brother , what have the ginger-hating kuffirs ever done for you anyway '' must have an appeal it lacks for normal people . 
  [ i quite agree ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/israelis-cheer-gaza-bombing ) . 
  literally the only argument as to why the jewish state had to be formed on the land of the palestinians , and not say the jewish independent oblast in russia , is `` coz the bible '' . 
  also zionism may be secular , but the rabbinical authorities have way too much influence for israel to truly be considered a secular state in the western understanding ( which israel apes ) of how such a state functions . 
  finally , if it 's not religious and it 's not genetic then what exactly * is * the basis for israel 's ongoing and egregious oppression of the native inhabitants of the land the zionist 's chose ( at random according to your argument ) to invade and viciously colonise . 
  r/israel is disturbingly racist and unrepentantly pro-violence ( except when israelis are the victims - everyone else if fair game though ) . 
  not all commenters obviously , some are very reasonable and seem like lovely people , but enough that reading through the comments there can be quite chilling . 
  what ? 
  your first sentence is childish nonsense , your second 's first clause is entirely true while its second clause is mere opinion ( and , let 's face it , bigotry ) while your final gem of a sentence is pompous bullshit . 
  with the all-seeing-brown-eye watching on ... 
  i 've been there , it is very beautiful and must have been an oasis of peace when he was enjoying it . 
  not so peaceful now with all the tourists ( myself included obviously ) , but still lovely . 
  awesome , i really like feijoada and that looks perfect . 
  is n't it though ? 
  those horton designs were incredibly advanced . 
  and aeronautics - the shaping was remarkable whether the stealth capabilities were by design or happy accident making no difference . 
  it took another 50 odd years to get a flying wing into production and frontline service . 
  they are watching a [ civilian ] city suffering the horrors of wwii-style terror bombing . 
  if you regularly drink the israeli propaganda koolaid this may come as a surprise to you , but the vast majority of gaza 's inhabitants are * not * members of hamas , let alone hamas soldiers , so if bombing them is justified then why would you say attacking israeli civilians is not ? 
  ( fwiw i deplore * all * violence against civilians , be they innocent palestinians , israelis - jewish or arab , or even the colonialist settlers who are themselves intrinsically guilty of colonialist violence against the indigenous palestinian population ... ), 
  the terrorists in this instance are the idf pilots , their officers and the regime which ordered the attacks . 
  i 'm glad you think airstrikes are cool to watch despite knowing children are dying as a result , how do you feel about unguided rockets landing in fields near israeli towns ? 
   are you supportive of palestinian war crimes ? 
  wow , that is a strawman from hell . 
  are you for real ? 
  fwiw , no , i am no more supportive of palestinian attacks than i am of israeli war crimes . 
  to qualify that remark , may i first remind all readers that one of the key measures of whether an act of war is a war crime is proportionality . 
  clearly , flattening entire apartment buildings because one resident is * allegedly * an hamas soldier in retaliation for random missile attacks which actually cause little significant damage , let alone significant casualties is * grossly * , * egregiously * disproportionate ; ergo what these `` innocent israeli civilians '' ( probably almost all idf reservists btw ) are cheering on are likely war crimes . 
  in terms of defending itself while still acting like a civilised nation , my primary suggestion is that israel allows a political settlement to proceed , instead of continuing settlement expansion and unrestrained violence from the idf within the occupied territories while the regime bleats on about not having `` blah blah a partner for peace coz pa blah blah terrorism blah '' . 
  obviously this is a lofty goal , so in terms of restraint i would advocate the following practical measures :, 
  - increased use of persistent surveillance systems ( eg [ drones ] ( http://www.jpost.com/israel-news/elbit-upgrades-iafs-fleet-of-hermes-900-drones-438803 ) , satellites , [ istar recon aircraft ] ( https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/israeli-air-force-showcases-g550-surveillance-fleet-339637/ ) , [ counter battery/istar ground based systems ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/04/28/israel-elbit-istar-unmanned-surveillance-sensors-soda-straw/26510651/ ) ) and israel 's notorious [ shabak/shin bet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shin_bet ) unit [ 217 duvdevan undercover ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duvdevan_unit ) operatives to improve the targeting quality with actual realtime intelligence . 
  israel possesses these tools , so the idf is either grossly incompetent or just dgaf enough to employ them ;, 
  - a reduction in the size of munitions used - a very precise 2,000 lb bomb is obviously going to cause more damage than an unguided , but properly delivered 250lb bomb . 
  western militaries now generally employ much smaller munitions in areas where there are civilians , eg the us [ sdb ( small diameter bomb ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/small_diameter_bomb ) or british [ brimstone guided missile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brimstone_ ( missile ) ) being modern examples . 
  ( i am well aware the idf uses the latest in us inventory pgms btw - quite literally in fact , as they actually tool them from us stockpiles . 
  - increased use of the attacks where a dudevan operative [ guides an apache missile launch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shin_bet#information_gathering.2c_interrogation_methods_and_torture ) instead of area bombing by f-16 / f-15s ;, 
  - taking a firm decision * not * to attack [ schools , hospitals and other areas sheltering civilians ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/children-killed-in-their-sleep-israeli-artillery-fire-hits-un-school-killing-at-least-20/ ) - even if it means that the occasional hamas soldier temporarily escapes vengeance, 
  taken together , all of these measures would greatly contribute to reduced censure for israel 's activities in gaza . 
  certainly were some effort made to follow such principles then i personally would not feel the need to censure the idf 's atrocities publicly in an effort to make sure people actually understand what is happening . 
  believe it or not , i would much rather not need to criticise either the palestinians or israel as opposed to the present situation in which i am only able to offer qualified support to both parties and need to criticise both . 
  of course , what would be best is , as i said , a political solution and it is to encourage the pursuit of one that i discuss the situation in forums such as this . 
  right , so when israelis kill civilians that 's just war , but israeli civilian casualties are all tragic war crimes ? 
  i would n't be forced into rhetoric you consider extreme if the disingenuity and mendaciousness which characterises israeli rhetoric on the conflict was n't so pervasive . 
  one example : you simply sidestep the fact that a significant base cause of the conflict is the israeli religio-nationalist settlers and their colonisation of the west bank and east jerusalem because , according to you , it 's ridiculous and beneath you to even contemplate that just perhaps israeli actions contribute to the conflict ... 
  while such attitudes are extant it 's little wonder no peace is in sight . 
  is n't '' [ googles ] ( https://www.rt.com/viral/361510-alt-right-cheat-sheet-racist/ ) '' the new word they 're using instead of `` urban '', 
  apologies for rt source - i know how evil and anti-american those dastardly russkies are , but it was the first result i found discussing the phenomenon , which previously i had only observed here on reddit previously , in the wild as it were ... 
  there 's still no acknowledgement that israel shares any responsibility for the conflict , though i did n't expect you would . 
  i deplore violence against israelis too , and regularly make that clear . 
  at least in australia we recognise that what happened here was colonisation , and that it was not cool . 
  we have made good progress in building a healthier relationship with the indigenous population , and by working together have made good progress in improving their lot . 
  are we perfect ? 
  no we 're not , but at least we have the basic humanity to gaf . 
  your attitude seems to be that it 's the palestinians fault for being in the way . 
  if only they 'd all just fuck * off * and die there would n't be a problem , right ? 
  edit : forgot the vital `` off '' in `` fuck off and die '' - i 'm sure the last thing you want is palestinians engaging in any activity which might lead to them * multiplying * !!, 
  ok , you convinced me - all the published information is wrong and israel is right . 
  do you think maybe you guys are n't killing * enough * civilians even ? 
  one thing : throwing a tantrum and then accusing me of histrionics comes across as a little , dare i say it , hypocritical ... 
  i never , ever try to excuse violence against israelis ; if i saw others doing so i would argue with them just a vociferously as i do all the apologists for violence against palestinians ... 
  that 's bingo !, 
  why do americans take all this stuff so * personally * ? 
  red there was all about how * she * personally epitomises the staggering diversity of the united states , and it 's obvious the extent to which such feelings drive the absolute refusal to accept that the us is not unique in its uniqueness . 
  it just seems so needy . 
  scarcely an attribute one associates with the truly self-confident . 
  it 's interesting , is n't it ? 
  definitely be interested . 
  please post some . 
  of course that 's mainly only if you 're palestinian . 
  luckily for jews their illegal buildings , on stolen land , often get made retrospectively legal . 
  it 's a funny old world , is n't it ? 
  catholics . 
  they 're fucking savages . 
  bosnia is a great place to visit . 
  i have been twice , once to mostar and once to sarajevo and they are both really lovely cities . 
  the mountains are fantastic too . 
  lovely people , great food and unbelievable value - if anyone gets the chance , i would recommend going unreservedly . 
   ... one of the israelis cursed him and ordered him to leave .
