  the west does n't know , but israel seems to think they do . 
  not that those things are related ; israel is not a western nation in any sense . 
  imo this kind of thing is quite deplorable . 
  the victim here was not a soldier or even an aggressive settler , but a man who traded with the palestinians . 
  neither side 's veneration of men ( orr women for that matter ) who are essentially violent criminals is conducive to achieving peace . 
  the pa should not publicly endorse terrorists any more than israel should endorse the zionist terrorists from its formation . 
  however , it is more than a little hypocritical for the israeli establishment to criticise the palestinians for doing what they too do every day . 
   values, 
   government, 
  < sniggers  sure . 
  well you guys do try at least , i guess . 
   laws, 
  i thought israel did n't recognise no steenkin ' international laws ? 
  you are the one that made a funny in the first place . 
  i may have phrased my response humorously , but it was a serious point . 
  you , otoh , simply can not have been serious in your claim that israeli values are aligned with those of the west as it 's an absurd notion that only someone who is utterly ignorant of western values could have made except as a joke . 
  israeli culture may ape western culture in certain regards , but is essentially predicated on a set of values that are , in other highly significant facets , completely at odds with post - [ enlightenment ] ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ ) , post-wwii western cultural values . 
  the same is true of government : even if we ignore the bizarre system where a leader that most israeli at least profess to dislike can remain in power since ' 09 , or the uncomfortably ( to western values ) tight bonds between the religious establishment and the political state , western values simply do not encompass the scenario the palestinians in the occupied territories are currently suffering through . 
  they are governed under an egregiously oppressive set of rules applied on the basis of their religio-ethnic identity and have no representation within the government that controls their lives , while the illegal settlers who live within the same regions as they do simultaneously enjoy normal israeli governance . 
  ( this is an issue that also relates closely to my previous point about culture . ), 
  finally in terms of laws , i may have employed an ironically lighthearted turn of phrase , but israel * does not * recognise international law : specifically the geneva convention iv , a treaty to which they are party , as well as a host of other international laws and norms surrounding such issues as nuclear weapons , the sovereignty of foreign nations and etc. . . israel 's own laws are another systemic aping of western systems in form , but not substance , as per the political system . 
  ( this too ties back into my first point , specifically wrt the post-wwii clause of the point . ),

  technically most important , but your point stands nonetheless . 
  i should have considered that before replying ; ben-gurion is certainly a very important figure , and deserves better than having his legacy judged through the lens of the worst aspects of his life 's work . 
  his ideals have always struck me as being admirable , even if circumstance forced him to become involved in murky business . 
  at this point i 'll cop the downvotes instead of deleting my comment , but also admit i was wrong .

   or at least an authoriser of terrorist attacks, 
  kdh attack occurred during period of alliance between hagganah and irgun . 
  hagganah chief sneh has admitted ben-gurion authorised the attack . 
  * however * , i have already admitted my response was neither appropriate to the specific question nor a fair judgement of ben-gurion . 
  i only did n't delete my original reply for the same reason i replied to you : so it would n't look like i was denying my statement or was trying to weasel out of it . 
  the responses i have left will do me for now though . 
  i do n't * care * about downvotes , but i do n't get off on them either , so this will have to be it .

  there is a vegetarian indian restaurant that does this here in perth , western australia , run by volunteers which raises money for charity and has been around for years : http://www.annalakshmi.com.au/mission/, 
  i guess one difference is that annalakshmi , being a charity run by volunteers using gifted ingredients does not risk losing money , but i think another is people have more scruples about ripping off a charity .
