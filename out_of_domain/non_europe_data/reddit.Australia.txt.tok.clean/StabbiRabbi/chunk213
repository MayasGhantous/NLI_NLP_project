  3 different hangars . 
  there are two kinds of countries in he world - those that use empirical evidence and those that provide healthcare without bankruptcy for their citizens . 
  it might be a gadgie burger , but it 's no a wee gadgie . 
  looks awesome . 
  what about if you hit hit someone else 's chest first , you know like a gypsy , homosexual , jew , communist , disabled person or someone like that ? 
  would that still count ? 
  coz i think that would work for neo-nazis too . 
  currently 88 % upvoted . 
  coincidence you think ? 
  do n't be so bloody na\u00efve ... 
  fwiw i think the questions as asked must have been too subjective ; i 'm sorry , but i simply can not believe that ksa is one of the most empathetic nations in the world . 
  maybe towards other saudis , but even that i doubt tbh . 
  * perhaps * towards other wahhabi muslims from the arabian peninsula ? 
  how can a country where so many asian maids are tortured and murdered , or guest workers treated appallingly generally , rank so high ? 
  depends which way you look at it , i guess . 
  if friday means getting blind drunk for you , then treating tuesday like friday is probably not too crash hot an idea . 
  if you 're miserable on a tuesday , but happy on friday then that is good advice . 
  also , not worrying * too much * what others , including the neighbours , think is much healthier than obsessing over it . 
  imo at least . 
  since you ask where would you go specifically , and not what would you do generally , i would say head to south east asia - specifically vietnam , laos , cambodia and thailand . 
  it 's absolutely beautiful , there are loads of things to do and see and you could stretch that money out there to live very comfortably indeed for 3mos . 
  whenever watching the presidential debates ? 
  it 's one of the options , not the only one though . 
  if the uk has been nuked , there 's a decent chance we have too . 
  though i guess our government might have survived , i mean , who 's going to bother nuking * canberra * , right ? 
  when was that though ? 
  i think it 's been fixed so doing that would require a huge amount of effort with new tabs at a minimum , and perhaps even that `` loophole '' closed . 
  even old school smileys do n't go over too well in most subs from what i have seen . 
  especially not winky faces ... 
  fuuuuuuuck yooooooou !, 
  worst advice ever . 
  you * have * to enter into a protracted and incredibly tedious slanging match that flows across multiple pages of comments and only ends when one calls the other literally hitler and the other smugly brings up godwin 's law . 
  it 's just the way of the internet . 
  if your karma was n't in the negative you would n't have to wait . 
  have an upvote to help you out of the time out between comment zone . 
  oh man , i know * exactly * what you mean . 
  and then you 're torn between wanting to rip strips out of them and not gaf . 
  it can be quite the dilemma . 
  especially when it 's not even on the basis of a given comment 's content , but because they 've disagreed with you in the past . 
  or it 's driven by shilling/brigading and purely aimed at stifling conversation . 
  ugh , infuriating . 
  nope . 
  as an aussie ( who has admittedly lived in the uk before ) i understand almost all anglophone accents , except , of course , really thick kiwi ones . 
  but * nobody * understands kiwis , right ? 
  sure , with migrant workers on construction sites and so on , perhaps , but the maid thing especially is a very personal interaction and there have been so many cases ... 
  no worries . 
  just comment in r/aww or somewhere friendly and you 'll get up over 0 in no time . 
  here 's another upvote , so maybe you 're there already . 
  it 's like that to slow trolls down , but unfortunately people like you get caught out by it ... 
  yeah , it 's like the old axiom about not arguing with idiots because they 'll drag you down to their level then beat you with experience , is n't it ? 
  same principle certainly . 
  yeah , i ca n't believe google has n't cracked down on that shit . 
  droppies are fucking tourists who `` do n't believe in them '' up , but because it has n't offended a politician or celebrity they let it carry on . 
  it 's grossly irresponsible corporate behaviour . 
  hurr durr , americans are * so * funny . 
  take your election for example : that shit 's fucking * hilarious * !, 
  fuck those racist cunts . 
  seriously , they 're just bigoted arseholes and there 's no point to their `` movement '' other than hate . 
  * note : the usa reserves the right to infringe on the life , liberty and property of any foreign nationals without forewarning or cause , both within and outside of us territory . 
  neither are all that exciting ... 
  that 's true actually . 
  similarly , perth would be pretty high on any southern hemisphere target lists due to the naval base just south of the city , where the ran subs operate in the indian ocean from . 
  australia actually hosts quite a few hot targets like those . 
  lol ? 
  if not lol , then :, 
   * you 're not needed, 
  honestly , i ca n't tell if you 're being ironic or not at this point ... 
  i think you guys have the right approach , the symbolism of the salute is too closely associated with nazism to have any legitimate , innocent usage in any political context . 
  i was just taking the piss out of neo-nazis for being bigoted , violent and stupid . 
  maybe i should have added a / s ? 
  i would never support such people , or enact the salute myself ftr . 
  [ source article ] ( http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/5606/chinas-j-20-stealth-fighter-will-likely-look-like-this-at-its-air-show-debut ) that discusses the j-20 , it 's development and potential capabilities . 
  it is believed the j-20 is about to be officially unveiled to the world at the upcoming biennial zhuhai air show in guangdong province . 
  also the [ jindalee over the horizon radar network ( jorn ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jindalee_operational_radar_network ) , with nodes dispersed across a number of locations ... 
  very much so . 
  * originally * ? 
  afaik it still is . 
  what spread can mirvs achieve ? 
  could canberra be targeted by warheads from the same missile as sydney or melbourne ? 
  of course nobody knows for sure , but there were conspiracy theories that australian cities could be targeted to send a strong message with only limited collateral damage due to our cities ' geographic isolation ( compared to cities in europe of the us ) ; otoh the government released their cold war assessments of the threat a few years back , which concluded [ our cities were not targets ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/secrets-out-soviets-did-not-target-cities-20120805-23ny1.html ) . 
  it 's all conjecture of course , but personally i am inclined to agree with the view you just posited : more than likely we would all end up as smoking rubble . 
  they can be independently targeted though , ca n't they ? 
  perhaps not over the distance between canberra and sydney or melbourne , but over a spread out conurbation ( like sydney ) at least ? 
  at * some point * ? 
  like , they do n't already ... 
  check out r/israel if you want to see how israelis think of the un ( hint : thoughts do not include giving any kind of fuck ... ), 
  [ for example , read the article in this link , and certain notorious commenters ' casual acceptance that the article 's view of the un is entirely factual and not at all a batshit crazy , biased rant in the comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/israel/comments/58773m/the_israeli_left_crosses_a_line/ ) . . 
  the mkviiis were a great model of spitfire , but grossly outnumbered in service by the mkixs , which were basically mkvs with the dual supercharged merlins intended for the mkviii rushed into production to combat the fw190 . 
  iirc the raaf was one of the main operators of the mkviii . 
  there 's a beautiful example preserved over here , `` grey nurse '' at temora aviation museum . 
  i have a bunch of pictures of that plane if anyone would like me to post some in here , both flying and on the ground . 
  only phone pics though , so the flying ones are n't the best ... 
  banging the bottle into a cushion against the wall will work on the same principle . 
  they are call [ canards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canard_ ( aeronautics \\ ) ) and basically they are they for manoeuvrability . 
  did you used to be a boy scout ? 
  your solution was certainly an ingenious application of the basic technique , perfectly adapted to your environment ... 
  i have never eaten seafood pho , but now it 's definitely on my list of `` dishes from r/food i must try '' . 
  luckily i live in a city with many fine vietnamese restaurants and there are a bunch of recipes online too , so this one should get crossed off quickly . 
  you 're wrong about the italians , except in the most anally semantic sense . 
  they did n't call themselves italians because they did n't speak english .
