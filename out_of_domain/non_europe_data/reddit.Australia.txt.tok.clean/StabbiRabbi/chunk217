  what type do you see ? 
  very few p-40s in the eto though , maybe something bigger , like a b-25 ( right sort of shape ) ? 
  the roundel is unmistakable , but the perspective screws with my sense of scale . . 
  i 'm sure quite a few b-17s were recycled by the germans , but i think the roundel is probably too close to the tip for a heavy like a liberator or a flying fort . . 
  that 's why i thought maybe a mitchell . . 
  yeah , i saw that . 
  usaf depots gearing up to keep 'em flying and fighting . 
  indefinitely . 
  i was thinking maybe liberator , but it 's so hard to gauge . . 
  i was trying to use the soldiers as yardsticks , but it 's just too complex with everything going on . 
  the idf just released a report on the incident yesterday , there was an article posted on r/israel from the toi . 
  ( heavily downvoted , so not first page anymore . ), 
  the report stated there was no need for the four soldiers seen firing to open fire , as the woman had already been shot in the legs and stopped from approaching before they even opened fire :, 
  so it seems that , in this case at least , the reality matched the reportage/video evidence presentation . 
  these things * can * be manipulated via editing and etc. . , but sometimes the evidence * does * speak for itself . 
  stalin 's specific persecution of jews post-dated wwii too ; of course some jews were caught up in his general persecution of , well , everyone , but he actually had a number of high-ranking jews close to him until the ( so-called ) `` doctors plot '' which was after the war . 
  ( it was also not actually a real plot , but that 's antisemitism for you . . , and stalin for that matter . . ), 
  the first sentence of op 's comment covering the general case is true , the second regarding those two leaders , at least during wwii is not . 
  and arguably while stalin 's actions were definitely antisemitic later , he was more driven by his paranoia than anti-jewish animus even then . 
  ooh , that far back ? 
  my family 's been in australia since 1804 , so should i then get to grab a slice of that sweet native title payola we give the indigenous australian peoples , given an 1890 connexion makes one totes indig ( iyho at least ) ? 
  it 's job ? 
  actually i believe the reasoning is i think more to do with required total force than the type itself specifically ( though it does fill an important role ) ; there are currently a lot of usaf aircraft forward deployed even as the fleet continues to shrink , so they need to retain all the assets they can . 
  smh . 
  i 'm not even going to say it . . 
  makes [ hugh glass 's story ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hugh_glass#grizzly_bear_mauling ) ( as recently told in * the revenant * ) seem all the more incredible . 
  granted he did have companions who helped to some extent , but his survival is quite remarkable . 
  reading this brought my memory of that bear fight scene back vividly . 
  looks like more of a * defocus * as they progress imo . . 
  * grill * for scale . 
  this * is * reddit after all . 
  no matter how cute the ~ ~ dog ~ ~ pupper one must honour tradition . 
  are those pizzas * hot * ? 
  no , i realised and was just elaborating further on the stalin part . 
  churchill 's record regarding jews , and the zionists , is pretty good as you say , but you had already made that point . 
  that is a very concise summary . 
  too concise to be considered remotely honest imo as you skipped several salient facts . 
  may i suggest this alternative wording ( you have my permission to edit your original comment using this text , so do n't say i never do anything to help the pro-israeli commenters here ) :, 
   the zionist terror campaign led to the mandate ending earlier than planned and in a violently chaotic manner ; israel declared independence , which entirely predictably triggered a war , then `` defended '' the territory it had seized on the flimsiest of pretexts , ie the un partition plan . . 
  in 1973 the us rushed arms directly from factories in the us straight to israel ( admittedly following golda meir 's unsubtle nuclear blackmail effort of arming thirteen 20kt nuclear weapons in the open at an idf air base when they knew a us satellite was overhead ) ; this effort was named operation nickel grass and is pretty well known , so how then can you claim the us did n't help israel win the yom kippur war in ' 73 ? 
  do n't want to take my word for it ? 
  ok , here 's a [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_nickel_grass ) :, 
   seeing israel 's vulnerable position , henry kissinger , the united states secretary of state and president richard nixon 's national security adviser , made arrangements for el al to pick up some items , including ammunition , `` high technology products '' and aim-9 sidewinder missiles at a us naval base in virginia . 
  a modest effort soon began , but kissinger still hoped to keep any visible involvement at a minimum . 
  on october 8 , israeli prime minister golda meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton nuclear warheads on jericho missiles and f-4s , which were prepared for action against syrian and egyptian targets ; their preparation was made easily detectable , likely as a signal to the united states . 
  kissinger learned of this threatening nuclear escalation on the morning of 9 october . 
  on that same day , meir issued a personal appeal for military assistance , which european nations declined . 
  u.s. president richard nixon , however , ordered the commencement of operation nickel grass , to replace all of israel 's materiel losses . 
  the decision was taken the same day the soviets began their own resupply operation of arab forces by sea . 
  anecdotal evidence suggests that kissinger had told anwar el sadat that the reason for the u.s. airlift was that the israelis were close to `` going nuclear . '', 
  and [ jabotinsky is the most popular street name in israel ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3476622,00.html ) ( jabotinsky was the vile , extreme-right-wing , fascist aligned , leader of notorious zionist terrorist group the irgun , who killed many more people than the munich attack in their king david hotel atrocity alone ) , so how can israel criticise the pa for displaying exactly the same behaviour ? 
  imo , both sides need to either stop celebrating their own terrorists or stop getting upset when the other side do . 
  ( though , tbf , the pa do n't tend to publish this type of whinging bullshit , so common from pro-israeli sources . . ), 
  these advanced strike eagle derivatives ( eg f-15k , f-15sg and etc. . ) are damn sexy planes . . 
  these are aggressor squadron aircraft , which is why they wear these colours . 
  they look incredible , do n't they ? 
  this is the [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douglas_a-1_skyraider#/media/file:a-1j_skyraider_va-176_vietnam_1966.jpg ) . 
  skyraiders from va-176 managed to down one mig-17 , damage another and probably destroy another [ during a dogfight over north vietnam during a rescue combat air patrol mission ] ( http://skyraider.org/skyassn/sartapes/migkill/migkill.htm ) during the cruise this photo is from . 
  also note the [ usn battle efficiency ` e ' award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_effectiveness_award ) just behind the cockpit , awarded to usn units ( ships , squadrons , etc. . ) that win their year-long battle effectiveness competition . 
  scotch whisky generally , enjoyed for the flavour as much as the effect . 
  i sincerely hope not , platypuses are a protected species , and much too cute to be made into hats to boot . 
  afaik they are currently the only us army unit that does . 
  oh-6as were common in vietnam , called loaches ( for light observation helicopters ) , but questions over the ability of hughes aviation ( who designed and manufactured the xh-6 family of helicopters until being bought out by mcdonnell douglas and then boeing ) led to them being replaced by oh-58a kiowas late in the war . 
  however , they are very good helicopters from all accounts and so were retained for use by the night stalkers in two configurations - mh-6 and ah-6 which are multi-purpose and attack variants respectively . 
  boeing is still selling these helicopters overseas too , with recent sales in the me of the latest version known commercially as the md-530 defender series . 
  so foreign armies are not only still using them , but are still buying them too . 
  all that is off the top of my head , so please apply an `` afaik '' & `` iirc '' to it all , but i am pretty sure i 'm right . . 
  no , there have always been jews in the region as we all know . 
  however , you were n't the op i replied to , whose circumstances are different . 
  being able to trace anyone 's ancestry back so far is quite remarkable - it 's amazing you are able to . 
  were your family significant in some regard ? 
  i guess that depends where you live now ? 
  your family is very lucky to have those kind of records , they must be they must be fascinating and give you a brilliant sense of connexion . 
  so many such records were lost , which just makes cases like yours all the more valuable . 
  just try to keep them away from ancestry.com , or they may [ secretly baptise your ancestors into the mormon church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baptism_for_the_dead#controversy ) . 
  obviously that would n't change your ancestors ' true status in the slightest , but it is very disrespectful to people who must have , at some point in the past 1400 years , suffered some kind of trouble for their religious identity imo . 
  no , i do not support stabbing rabbis . 
  i do n't support the stabbing of anyone in actual fact . . 
  or bombing , or shooting . . 
  an/alq -99 tactical jamming pod : http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/systems/an-alq-99.htm, 
  the propeller provides electrical power . 
  this is the current pod used , but a new `` next generation jammer '' is currently in development , with service entry planned for 2021 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/next_generation_jammer, 
  it was intended as an ironic commentary on the cyclical nature of violence , referring to the [ sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ) who were religious jews who went around stabbing their enemies during the roman era . 
  i know that as zealots it was their enemies , the pharisees who went on to create rabbinical judaism and so it 's not strictly accurate , but it also is a kind of visual play on words . . 
  so it does n't actually refer to stabbing rabbis , but rather `` rabbis '' that stabbed people , 2000 odd years ago . 
  there may have been one stab attack prior my creating the account ( my creating it because i supported that is a somewhat popular - albeit untrue - theory among some particularly opposed to any form of dissent users here . . ) , but if so it was only just before and certainly nobody knew how much of a problem such attacks would later become . 
  tbh i would have chosen a different handle had i realised how most people would interpret it , let alone been able to see into the future and predict that a `` stabbing intifada '' would erupt . 
  nonetheless , i have had the account for nearly two years now , so yeah . 
  it is what it is i guess . . 
  in australia we tend to prefer civil approaches , the problem with violence is once it takes hold it becomes a cycle that neither side is willing to break , so it 's better to not respond with violence , but rather with civil means such as arrests and etc. 
  for example , there was recently a race riot with stones and bottles being thrown at police in kalgoorlie ( a town in western australia ) following the death of an aboriginal boy . 
  it was dealt with by attempting to calm the situation and then , once calmer , engaging with community leaders : no reprisals , no violent response . 
  obviously this is more difficult with more intractable opponents ( eg hamas ) , but still sometimes you win more fights by not fighting than by insisting on an eye for an eye every time . . 
  well , to an extent , that is actually what we in australia did . . 
  look , i realise your `` suggestion '' is meant ironically , as a dig at people like myself who say an accommodation should be reached with the palestinians , but i for one am not advocating that israel proper surrenders a single square centimetre , just that the settlements be reconsidered for the sake of peace . 
  australia handed title over massive swathes of the country back to indigenous australian peoples who had traditionally inhabited the land , and encoded it in law : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/native_title_act_1993, 
  this was without regard for whatever ( usually mineral ) wealth lay beneath and now the traditional owners have control over how the land is used and benefit from revenue raised by any economic activities they choose to allow on that land . 
  it 's not all remote areas either - some particularly significant sites in cities have also been ceded , though not property over which title is held by individuals . 
  whilst obviously not precisely comparable , an analogue for israel 's situation might be that the occupied territories be enshrined in law as palestinian , while places like ta and etc remain in israeli hands . 
  obviously this is a simplification and there are more subtleties to both situations than could be covered in a book , let alone a comment like this , but i am well aware of the fact i ca n't fix anything personally so that is n't my goal anyway .
