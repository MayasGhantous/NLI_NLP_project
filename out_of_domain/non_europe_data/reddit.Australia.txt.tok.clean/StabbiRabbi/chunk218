  all i am trying to do is offer my own perspective , as informed by my own experiences . 
  sure , i ca n't make you think anything and tbh i do n't really * want * to force anyone to think anything . . all i can do is express my own thoughts , and happily that 's all i really aim to do . 
  to give you more background , i had been watching a program on masada which obviously discussed the zealots , and with them the sicarii , that i followed up with reading on the matter ( because i am a bit of a history buff . . ) ; the name came to my mind from that , but certainly the visual wordplay aspect of it was one of the things that appealed to me most . 
  i thought `` oh it 's just a username , we all need to have one and heaps of the good ones are gone '' ( not my first reddit account btw ) , but others obviously feel these things * have * to have a deeper significance than i do . 
  the thing is , sometimes things are just what they are . . 
  no irony detector huh ? 
  and `` abbos '' ? 
  really ? 
  i do get what you 're saying , but that 's easy for you to say with so little karma . 
  check out all my sweet , sweet imaginary internet points though !, 
  plus my fans would be left bereft , and i do n't want to do that to them . 
  does he mean swedish-americans , o the eurocuck variety ? 
  because while your seventeenth-generation-living-in-the-us swedes can obviously speak ~ ~ english ~ ~ american ( sorry , my mistake ! ), 
  from living there , do n't all the eurocuck ones speak arabic instead now already ? 
  some other background ( mainly anglo though my family has been in australia for a very long time on both sides ) . 
  the closest personal connexions i have with israel are via jewish friends and colleagues . . 
  my interest was piqued initially from my reading of history , particularly ancient history . 
  obviously the entire levant region is very significant historically and i first began to learn about the region from that perspective . 
  my immediate family also share this interest , and my parents have travelled extensively in the me , both for work in my father 's case and on holiday for both of them . 
  i am also very interested in current affairs ( as are most people whose world extends beyond the end of their nose . . ) and coming from a primarily anglo background i have always read/watched the bbc a lot , in addition to local ( australian ) sources of reportage . 
  the mena region is very much a nexus of those two interests , so developing an interest in what 's happening there is a pretty natural progression , particularly for me following conversations with a former business partner ( we started a software development company together while i was at university which we ran for several years ) whose family is quite prominent in the local ashkenazi community , but also has very strong ties to israel dating back to well before wwii . 
  idk if you have read robert fisk , but he wrote an excellent book about the lebanese civil war , * [ pity the nation : lebanon at war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pity_the_nation ) * which my father passed on to me to read and served to cement my enduring interest in contemporary levantine affairs . 
  this is perhaps more information than you were interested in , but i would like to explain why i find it all so interesting and what has informed my perspective . 
  contrary to what a lot of people seem to think of me ( despite my protestations ) , i am not at all unsympathetic to the israeli point of view and do genuinely support israel 's right to continued existence and self-determination , enjoying peace and prosperity . 
  i realise that the way i express myself makes me seem , shall we say , outspoken on these issues , but i do n't wish to see anything bad befall israel . 
  i simply believe that a resolution to the conflict is increasingly necessary as people on both sides , from both nations , are suffering horribly and it is honestly awful to watch even as a complete outsider . 
  i 'm being very frank with you here ( despite knowing how many downvotes it will draw , idgaf about that . . ) because the conversations i find most interesting are the ones that are not confrontational and where i and the other participant may not agree , but can at least talk in depth instead of just slinging mud ( there have been several pro-israeli commentators with whom i have reached that kind of understanding , and i value the conversations we 've shared greatly ) and you seem like someone who is willing to engage . 
  whether i am wrong about that or not , hopefully * someone * will read it and engage with me , despite not necessarily agreeing with all my views . 
  finally , you might wonder why , if i am as pro-israel as i claim , so much of what i write tends to be criticism ? 
  the fact of it is that when one comments in r/worldnews the attitude of certain pro-israeli redditors makes people who are generally quite neutral become more combative , as they respond very aggressively to * any * perceived criticism of israel . 
  that was certainly my experience - my first comment ( using a past account ) about israel was something really quite innocuous , but some guy got all up in my face and started really having a go at me ( literally saying `` oh and i suppose you 're not antisemitic , you 're just anti-zionist , right ? '', 
  at the end of a similarly charming rant in reply to what i wrote . . ) . 
  while i can understand how frustrating ( enraging even ) it mus be to read uninformed bullshit about your country constantly , some genuinely being very thinly-veiled antisemitism , responding to anyone who dares comment in that manner is , imo and from my experience , highly counterproductive ; one end result is people such as myself who are actually pretty neutral holistically respond in kind . 
  i know some of it is confirmation bias , but it does seem a lot of people who are pro-israel try very hard to stifle any debate , let alone dissent , and it is very unattractive . 
  i feel , to an extent , that people such as myself have an important role in getting alternative points of view that are not driven by antisemitic animus out there into the discussion so that others may make their own minds up , despite the shit i get for doing it from some of the more infamous pro-israeli redditors out there . 
  in fact , tbh , it reached the point where at one stage i actually * wanted * to piss a couple of people off and provoke them into exposing the extremism of their positions , though it was only a couple of people ( who are openly very bigoted against palestinians and imo highly hypocritical in what they write ) and i regret that it has also annoyed the more reasonable pro-israelis too - hence efforts like this to explain and engage and why i comment in this sub in the first place . 
  now this ended up being a very long reply , and you might think it 's all bullshit , but i am genuinely not making excuses ( as i do n't think i 'm doing anything wrong ) and am trying to help people such as you understand what drives my interest . 
  take from it what you will . 
  tl ; dr i am from another background , just interested because of reasons that do not include a dislike of jews or israel . . 
  i 'm starting to think this might just be a language barrier issue : maybe american is just so different from english now that some words have become mutually unintelligible ? 
  certainly the linked op 's definition of `` win '' is vastly different from the accepted usage in other anglophone nations . .

  it 's from an [ army.mil yearly photo album ] ( https://www.army.mil/yearinphotos/2015/february.html ) :, 
   feb. 24 , 2015 - photo by u.s. army visual information specialist jason johnston, 
   a u.s. army soldier , assigned to 1st battalion , 10th special forces group ( airborne ) , salutes his fellow soldiers while jumping out of a c-130 hercules aircraft over a drop zone in germany . 
  so it does n't say training zone specifically , just drop zone . 
  given it 's a photo from february , i wonder if the reflections are off snow , rather than lakes and with woods in between ? 
  that would suit germany 's geography , and make sense in terms of when the photo was taken and where they would likely train : hills with patches of water might not be the best drop zone ? 
  there are large training areas in germany , i think it would make sense that it 's one of them , but these guys * are * sf and would potentially jump anywhere !, 
  all the above ( below the quote ) is pure guesswork though !, 
  also a litening targeting pod , pretty important bit of kit !, 
  they 're 2.75 '' rockets , could have a variety of warheads from smoke to he to flechette , or even be apkws laser guided rockets . 
  ( i believe , though i might be wrong about everything about them being rockets ! ), 
  edit : check out the vipers too , all wild weasel cms to the front , with harm targeting system pods and harms , amraams and sidewinders . 
  you get an incredible view from those blisters , they were excellent design work on consolidated 's part . 
  i was lucky enough to go for a flight in a restored example , and got to sit in the blisters for part of the flight , which was over nz 's south island , around wanaka . 
  we even landed on the lake there and fast taxied on the water for a mile or so . 
  really a brilliant experience i 'd recommend to anyone who is over there and sees the catalina at an airshow or whatever . 
  looks as good as it sounds . 
  leeks are so nice , but i have n't eaten any for ages , you have inspired me to go and buy some though . 
  if `` we did n't start the fire '' was rewritten today , what events would it include . . 
  to support the project they let people become temporary members of the preservation society and contribute to the flight costs , so long as everyone aboard is paying a share of the expenses ( pilots and other crew included ) it does n't fall under commercial aviation regulation . 
  [ here 's their website ] ( http://www.nzcatalina.org.nz/ ) , they 're a great group and their cat is beautiful . 
  by the spike i 'm guessing you mean the radar cone in the centre of the intake ? 
  that does move as the aircraft flies at different speeds , so it could be that ; however , the red/white checked one is a trainer and may have a smaller radar fitted , as earlier mig-21 versions did , i am not sure about that . 
  looking at this and the other picture of the same two aircraft posted by op i think a smaller radar in the trainer is the most likely explanation though . 
  edit : to be clear , i think the radar may be smaller because it 's a trainer , not because it 's a much older variant ( the variants are explained below ) . 
  * very * early 1st & 2nd gen mig-21s had the smaller radars ; however , while the lo-viz single seater is a later model than the flag scheme trainer it 's still from the same 3rd generation of mig-21s . . 
  actually it 's the other way around ( i was n't 100 % certain of the trainer version , so just googled it to be sure . . ) . 
  the lo-viz single-seater ( `` fishbed '' in nato parlance ) is a mig-21bis-d , which is a nato-interop-standard version of the final generation of the mig-21 ( bis , with the d denoting the croat nato upgrades ) . 
  the red/white check croatian flag two-seater ( nato reporting name `` mongol '' ) is a mig-21umd , a nato ops standard trainer variant of the earlier mig-21mf . 
  it 's all in here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mikoyan-gurevich_mig-21_variants, 
  no worries . 
  i have a particular interest in the croatian af versions ; it 's a country where i have family and is a regular holiday destination for me too , so i * did * have a bit of an unfair advantage on these aircraft beyond general knowledge . . 
  i 've also always really liked that croatian flag mongol , i think it 's a great looking plane . 
  umm , should n't mum be slave leia rather than darth vader ? 
  damn , i 'd eat that . . 
  just had jalape\u00f1o cream cheese on a bagel for breakfast , now i want more jalape\u00f1o already . 
  sounds great , i had bacon with my bagel and it is a combination that definitely works . 
  i 've eaten something similar to what you just described at a bar too , and it was also really tasty . 
  i think those flavours just work together really well .
