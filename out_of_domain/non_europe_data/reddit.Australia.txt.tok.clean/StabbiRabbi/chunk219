  [ the bombing of guernica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica ) , which was carried in out in 1937 by german and italian fascist forces during the spansih civil war , is notorious as one of the first instances of modern bombers being used to deliberately target civilians . 
  it so horrified pablo picasso that he painted his striking [ eponymous anti-war art work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guernica_ ( picasso \\ ) ) in protest , one of the most famous anti-war paintings in art . 
  for those who are interested , here 's [ an interactive graphic of the painting ] ( https://www.thinglink.com/scene/767912106522574848 ) , linking photographs to elements within it . 
  * come on * , show us your skave leila outfit , pleeeeeeeas . . 
  ah it was still funny , and if anything the edit makes it funnier , imo . 
  you got my upvote at least man . 
  [ the henschel hs 293 was a world war ii german anti-ship guided missile : a radio controlled glide bomb with a rocket engine slung underneath it . 
  it was designed by herbert a. wagner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henschel_hs_293 ) . 
  together with the [ fritz-x 1400 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_x ) , the hs 293 was one of the first precision guided munitions to enter service . 
  although initially successful , by d-day the allies had developed sophisticated electronic countermeasures that were able to effectively jam the weapon 's guidance system .

  that 's just how the american school system teaches `` math '' [ maths ] . . 
  it 's like the troubles they have with the whole per capita concept . . 
  numeracy just is n't their thing : in america the only thing that even counts is * freedom * !, 
  hmm , sounds like he 's a bit fixated on his `` aryan '' characteristics . 
  tbh , i can totally understand why german politicians are suspicious of characters like him .

  lance adsit , 20th bomb squadron aircraft commander , and lt. col. erik johnson , 340th weapons squadron commander , fly a b-52 stratofortress above the gulf of mexico oct. 13 , 2016 . 
  two b-52s from barksdale air force base , la. , and two b-1 lancers from dyess air force base , texas , flew together and performed more than 200 simulated missile launches as part of a weapons school integration exercise .

  they only have like 18 total , so two * is * a pretty decent chunk of that total force . . 
  lucky it 's a great fighter , right ? 
  i did n't actually realise they were so downgraded - i knew they are tranche one jets which have n't had the updates provided to other air forces ' typhoons/ef2000s ( eg no a2g capability ) and we can all see the irst sensor is missing from in front of cockpit , but i had no idea they were quite so basic . 
  those are interesting links , cheers !, 
  i hate linking to axe ( or rogoway for that matter ) too , but sometimes they * do * provide decent summaries . 
  one just has to ignore their editorial commentary is all . . 
   to epitomize its spirit and tactical superiority over the japanese , the squadron decided it would be called the ` sundowners ' and its insignia depicts two wildcats shooting down a rising sun . 
  that comes from the [ wikipedia article of the squadron history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vf-111_ ( 1956-95 \\ ) ) , and describes the [ squadron 's insignia ( ie patch ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:vfc-111.png ) , so the name dates back to the pacific theatre of wwii ( where the `` sun '' they `` downed '' was the imperial japanese ) , which leads on to the `` rising sun '' tail seen here . . 
  the sundowners ' scheme is one of my personal favourite usn squadron schemes : with that tail and the shark mouth they are just great looking planes across all the types they have flown , from [ f-8 crusader ] ( http://www.flying-tigers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/su8-f-8h-of-vf-111-on-uss-ticonderoga-cva-141969.jpg ) , through the phantom ii we see here , on to the [ f-14 tomcat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/f-14_vf-111_launching_phoenix_1991.jpeg ) and finally the aggressor role [ f-5e / f tigers ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v375/butz/1260526465_2a68085126.jpg ) they currently fly . . ), 
  pakistan are [ receiving ah-1z viper ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/59267/pakistan-to-receive-nine-ah-1z-attack-helos ) attack helicopters , does anyone know if they are considering the z-10 as well , or was this trial conducted prior to the viper deal ? 
  ok , let 's wait for the full report . 
  oh wait , they do n't have the best record of not exonerating themselves though , do they , the idf ? 
  that is a drop tank , but idk if it would be released with the weapon either . . 
  modern jets fly with asymmetric loads regularly , but the do 217 would have such different handling qualities that one has to assume it probably did n't have the power needed to do so - i know even very powerful piston engined aircraft such as the a-1 skyraider struggled with that issue sometimes when ordnance hung . 
  how do know it 's not because the pope came out in support of * israel * ? 
  bill clinton of course being known primarily for never lying to make himself look better . .

  not meaning to detract from the significance of the photo , or your great-great-grandfather 's work , but tasmanian aboriginals still survive to this day , and the myth they do n't is something they take great exception to . . 
  fanny cochrane smith may have been the last full-blooded individual to survive , but it 's simply wrong to say that there are no tasmanian aboriginals left . 
  i know this from having been to tasmania , but here 's a more readily accesible source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aboriginal_tasmanians, 
  in many asian countries nazi uniforms are [ considered chic all year round , with swastikas and all ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/nazis-chic-is-asias-offensive-fashion-craze-456 ) . . 
  i know a guy who lives in lithuania who told me about receiving these almost exactly two years ago , i wonder if this is an updated version of the booklet or they 've just reheated the story ? 
   they take one photo , name one location , and then proclaim that it 's the `` new big thing '', 
  except this phenomenon is well reported by many other sources , not just vice , vice were just the first source on the google results :, 
  so it seems your little rant is redundant in this case . . 
  i too am a zionist : i believe israel should exist . 
  however , i think israel should exist within defined borders that do not include the west bank ; i believe president obama also shares that opinion too . 
  is bennett the most unpleasant individual holding power in a democracy today ? 
  certainly he and his gang of bigots , the jewish home party , hold some * very * unpleasant views , and their inherent nastiness is greatly amplified by how influential they are in the current israeli regime . . 
  recursion in chocolate ? 
  whatever 's next . . 
  that 's why i find these * hocus pocus * group costumes fascinating : seeing which witch is the hottest in each rendition . . 
  idk what it 's like in the states , but here we accept that people of mixed ancestry can claim to be aboriginal legally , culturally , morally , however you want to cut it . 
  what they take exception to is being told by ignorant bigots they do n't exist . . 
  i tried pointing that out in the r/historyporn x-post of this , which did n't go down to well with some seppo who reckons there are none left because they are n't full-blooded . 
  seems the myth is more appealing than the truth for whatever reason . . 
  i 'm not offended , i 'm just a regular anglo-aussie myself , but yeah , you know . . 
  those guys do have enough problems without being told they do n't even exist i guess . 
  which is not on you at all , and i really am not trying to have a dig or downplay the importance of the picture . 
  ( i think it 's a great picture by the way . . ), 
  yep , that 's australia alright . .

   the israeli ambassador to the united states is expected to accept an award in december from a washington , d.c.-based anti-muslim think tank whose founder is a proponent of the conspiracy theory that members of the muslim brotherhood have infiltrated the u.s. government . 
  so the ambassador of a country whose supporters regularly throw tantrums about many fringe commentators ' / conspiracy theorists ' belief that it has infiltrated and subverted the us government is publicly associating himself with an organisation that accuses his nation 's victims/critics of doing the same . . 
  how ironic . 
  hypocritical even , one might say . 
  well , i wish more pro-israeli people would read this so they could see what the side-effects of israel 's brutal occupation have included on the society it brutalises . . 
  brutalise a people for fifty years and yes , the culture will become `` repressive '' . 
  totes yes way man !, 
  what did * you * go as ? 
  i 'm going to go ahead and guess : it was a white knight , right ? 
  nice try , but nope . 
  as an australian i did n't actually go to a halloween party at all , it 's not really a thing here . . 
  grounds . . or beans ? 
  huh , i see what you mean , but i would have phrased that differently . . 
  ok , sure . . 
  lol . 
  that 's not what 's funny . 
  nor is it when carried out by anyone else , is it ? 
  ok , sure . 
  lol . 
  i would do more reading yourself , from both sides of the equation . 
  there is a great deal of bias in these threads ; remember you are reading opinion/interpretations of events , rather than pure objective fact . 
  i 'm not going to push my personal opinions onto you , but i am happy to recommend authors : [ robert fisk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_fisk ) is an excellent british journalist who has been reporting from the me for over thirty years and is not only very knowledgeable , but also very balanced , while for a jewish view you could try [ norman finkelstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_finkelstein ) . 
  edit : in response to another commenter 's concerns i would suggest finkelstein is not so much anti-israeli as pro-peace and anti-occupation . 
  if you read finkelstein , you can see what he has to actually say and subsequently make your own mind up from his own words : a great book to start on him with is his [ * image and reality of the israel -- palestine conflict * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/image_and_reality_of_the_israel%e2%80%93palestine_conflict ) . 
  another prominent american jewish academic who has written a lot about the conflict is [ noam chomsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noam_chomsky ) .
