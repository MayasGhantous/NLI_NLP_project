  the point is to read as much as possible , especially from sources who have n't served either the palestinian or the israeli polity . 
  i think the warning star is actually just as cool as the starfighters , as iconic as they are . 
  the ec-121 played a very significant combat role over vietnam and is critical in the evolution of modern networked air warfare as one of the first awacs type platforms . 
  sapa is a beautiful place to visit : i would definitely say to anyone who the chance to take it . 
  the hmong villages are really interesting too . 
  that 's a biiiiig ball of fluff !, 
  the warning star started out as a super connie , and even the radomes ca n't take away that sleek fuselage and the grace of its lines , especially in the scheme pictured , but yeah . . 
  i find strategi airlifters really interesting too ; that 's another incredibly significant capability that too few people pay any heed to . 
  yep , that 's pro-israeli reasoning in a nutshell right there . 
  israel has n't been around for centuries , only about seventy years . 
  before that the * kingdom of * israel last existed in 722bc . 
  i actually agree and do n't think israel should be boycotted , let alone via a boycott led by an organisation tainted by association with people who would like to see israel destroyed . 
  as i have probably told you before , as a zionist i believe israel has every right to exist . 
  in any case , proper state sanctions would be far more effective in ending the occupation and allowing peace .

  jw blue is not the worst whisky in the world or anything , but it does not represent good value for money . 
  as you 're enjoying single malts i personally would advise looking for something else - the [ next level malts guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpgmlltexf99kcqgjcnwgdy7_dceq8cdil1ijklkoue/edit#heading=h.i23il3ual5dx ) maintained by this sub ( linked from the sidebar ) is a great place to look for suggestions . 
  also worth checking out from the sidebar is the [ malt map ] ( http://scotchgit.bitbucket.org/# ) , which is another a neat resource that will help you find other expressions with a similar profile to the whiskies you mentioned enjoying . 
  if you would like my 2 cents , i would suggest considering a glengoyne 21yo . 
  it is a little more expensive than the jwb , but is a beautiful dram and fits the style of those you mentioned ( ie a sherry bomb ) , but more intense . 
  if you do n't want to spend more than you had budgeted for a jwb , then the glengoyne 18yo is cheaper and also a lovely whisky . 
  he might mean at work , ie on [ work ] site ? 
  that depends very much on what else is in the sandwich ; dijon is a good general mustard , but some things go much better with a grain mustard of some kind ( eg nice baked ham goes well with a honey grain mustard . . ) , or even a hot english style mustard ( eg rare roast beef , if one is using mustard instead of my real preference , horseradish ) . 
  wrong fucking answer , schweinhund . 
  this thread 's for mustard-eaters , not lame ducks who ca n't handle it . 
  jk , that was a * tad * harsher than your comment really deserved , i mean , what you eat is your own choice and i guess `` no mustard '' * is * an answer to the question , of sorts . 
  in all seriousness though , i would urge that as you grow up and your tastes mature you keep trying mustard , as by avoiding it you are missing out on so much flavoursome goodness . 
  if you do n't like its bite , then go for something that is n't so fierce , eg an american style , or a grainy-honey mustard , to start . . 
  may i ask what you substitute for mustards ? 
  do you like horseradish ? 
  if you like horseradish i take back the first sentence entirely and would consider the urgency of monitoring the evolution of your tastes significantly reduced . 
  this is a really interesting story that i first stumbled across in a thread about the montenegrin part of the plot in r/worldnews . 
  serbia is trying to improve its lot economically with closer ties to the eu ( which most of the former yugoslav states have already joined , allowing them to leave serbia behind economically ) , but - serbia being a traditional ally of russia due to cultural affinity ( pan-slavism and orthodox christianity being the root of that ) - this has caused tension in a number of ways . 
  this montenegrin plot is the latest episode , and one of the more serious , but by no means the only sore point . 
  another constant irritant is bosnia , where the serbian population want to separate from the bosnian federation and set republika srpska up as its own country . 
  they are supported in this by russia , but not by the serbian government , due to the desire to forge economic ties with europe which any support for the effort to break bosnia up would immediately sour . 
  i was in bosnia about a month ago , in the run-up to their elections , and the tension between republika srpska with its bosnian serbs and serbia proper was quite apparent , even to a tourist who does n't speak serbo-croatian , or even read cyrillic characters fluently . 
  this was due to the extremely nationalistic campaign advertisements serb parties/politicians had absolutely everywhere in serb parts of sarajevo and throughout the republika srpska , the gist of which was immediately apparent to anyone with any knowledge of the situation there . 
  ( i went through banja luka , which is the bosnian serb 's administrative centre and i honestly do n't know if i saw any ads except highly nationalistic politicians ' campaign posters either there or on the roads leading in/out of the city ! ), 
  while in the case of republika srpska the bosnian serbs have been inviting russian involvement , this takes that disconnect between serbia 's ruling polity and the russians to a whole new level . 
  it reads like a political thriller , or a history book - with the latter being somewhat concerning . 
  do n't the russians remember what happens when great powers meddle in the balkans ? 
  the mosquito was such a superb aircraft that really enabled this type of precision aerial strike in an era before precision guided munitions . 
  with its speed and handling it could get away from fighters and its wooden construction apparently made it less visible on radar than other types . 
  that really helped with attacks like this , where larger , less agile aircraft could probably not have even made it to the target , let alone deliver bombs with the requisite accuracy . 
  i 'm with u/fareeqawal , i agree with all your points and think that 's an excellent analysis . 
  in any discussion of this subject , from anyone involved on either side , it 's always interesting and refreshing to hear honest reflections , without any of the usual bluster or dissimulation one encounters . 
  do you express your views around other , more nationalistic , people ( either jewish or arab ) , and , if so , how do they respond to your perspective ? 
  what sort of tech do you work with ? 
  there is a great development community out of israel , and some of the guys whose ideas have been most influential for me professionally have been either israeli or diaspora jews who spent time in israel working and still work at least partially out of israel still . 
  i also used to have a business partner who was an aussie jew , but whose family had very strong and longstanding ( ie pre-1948 ) ties to the jewish community in palestine/israel ( once israel was formed ) with whom i owned a development business for several years . 
  what do you think of the `` startup nation '' appellation people use for israel , and do you think working in tech there is better or worse for your professional development than working in another country might have been ? 
  does the political situation ever impact on your work , or do you find the people you interact with from overseas keep their political and professional opinions/attitudes separate ? 
  this is very interesting to me because i have a strong interest in the region 's affairs , and am at times quite critical of israeli policy/actions surrounding the occupation , but i would never dream of mentioning even taking an interest to the israelis i connect with via my work . 
  in one sense i would like to , but i would hate for my views to be taken the wrong way and these people to think i am anti-israel as so many people on reddit do whenever i raise questions or concerns about the situation vis a vis palestine so i simply do n't bring up any interest in any facet of the entire subject more recent than the romans . 
  of course in a strictly professional setting one does n't talk about politics anyway , but i have spent a lot of time with some israelis ( and obviously a massive amount of time with my former business partner , with whom i still stay in touch ) outside of a strictly work context too . 
  am i , in your opinion , right to stay away from the topic ?

  you should x-post this to r/purses . . 
  the ongoing conflict in occupied palestine . 
  it 's been dragging on for years , has resulted in thousands of casualties between both sides and is a festering sore in the region that spawns yet more conflict in surrounding areas . 
  what ? 
  ethnic cleansing is different from genocide . 
  often the two go hand in hand , but it is totally possible to ethnically cleanse a region without killing all those who have been displaced . 
  conflation of the two is either a result of ignorance or dissimulation . 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_ac-130 ) :, 
   the sole operator is the united states air force , which uses the ac-130u spooky and ac-130w stinger ii [ 4 ] variants for close air support , air interdiction , and force protection , with the ac-130j ghostrider in development . 
  that 's the catalina i flew in ( as a passenger ) . 
  i flew in it after the wanaka airshow this year , we flew around the mountains there for about twenty mins and did a touch down in the lake . 
  absolutely brilliant experience . 
  watching this video was a great reminder . 
  how do we know you do n't just have huge feet ? 
  or even just one huge foot for that matter . . 
  it was primarily officers were gentlemen and other ranks were not . 
  there were wwi [ battalions of all public schoolboys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_schools_battalions ) in which men who otherwise might have sought a commission served with their friends instead , these were some of kitchener 's pals battalions . 
  between upper and middle classes , different regiments offered different levels of prestige , and so it would be the upper class gentleman who gained commissions in the brigade of guards and etc , while middle class gentlemen settled for lesser regiments . 
  later in both world wars though one saw `` temporary gentleman '' , or ors given a commission for the duration .

  well , if you do n't like it , instead of hassling me , i think you need to address your concerns to the generations of airman who have worn the famous ( phamous ? ), 
  [ `` phantom phlyer '' patches ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=phantom+phlyer&amp;sa=x&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1895&amp;bih=930&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ved=0ahukewihxoxlu5xqahwgjpqkhyozbleq7akimg ) . . 
  have you really * never * seen * that * before ? 
  it 's only like the most famous patch worn by phantom ii crews for the last fifty years or so , the equivalent of the tomcat 's `` anytime baby '' or the wild weasels ' `` ygbsm '' . 
  i guess the control interface has previously been too labour-intensive for operational use ; however , there is currently a program in progress that aims to use f-16s in the manner you suggest : the '' [ loyal wingman ] ( https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pentagon-touts-loyal-wingman-for-combat-jets-423682/ ) '' project . 
  [ spie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_patrol_insertion/extraction ) . 
  these qf-4 phantoms have been replaced by qf-16s , which recently reached ioc ( initial operational capability ) , so most of the qf-4 flights these days are n't afaik even supporting missile tests and so on , but are performed for the heritage flight ( hence the '70s south east asia green/brown camo scheme worn by this aircraft ) ; as they are being phased out it would n't make much sense in operating the remaining f-4s as autonomously flown wingmen , but it 's certainly an interesting idea for the new qf-16s ( which are more agile and etc than the old phantoms as well ) . 
  it it a good idea from a force multiplication perspective , and as many articles like the one i linked discuss , it looks like it 's happening . . 
  variations are still being worn by those air forces still operating f-4s , but the f-4 's frontline role within the usaf was supplanted post-desert storm , so yeah , you have to look overseas to see them nowadays , and have had to for quite some time . . 
  damn , that looks tasty af . 
  i love me some shakshuka , what a great way to start your day . .
