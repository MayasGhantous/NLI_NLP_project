   a u.s. air force boeing b-52f-70-bw stratofortress ( s/n 57-0162 , nicknamed `` casper the friendly ghost '' ) from the 320th bomb wing dropping m117 750 lb ( 340 kg ) bombs over vietnam . 
  this aircraft was the first b-52f used to test conventional bombing in 1964 , and later dropped the 50,000 th bomb of the `` arc light '' campaign . 
  b-52fs could carry 51 bombs and served in vietnam from june 1965 to april 1966 when they were replaced by b-52ds which could carry 108 bombs . 
  you are still conflating the two concepts . 
  your personal position seems entirely reasonable , and very similar to my own , but ethnic cleansing is occurring as the settlements expand , squeezing the indigenous palestinian population into ever smaller areas with fewer resources . 
  at this point it may be mere semantics we are arguing over , but i think , so long as we can acknowledge that is the case , words are important in and of themselves . 
  if those were my options i would certainly take the curry !, 
  i 'm glad i do n't have to choose one , but may rather enjoy clean air , though . . 
  are you a sikh from pakistan or from india ? 
  ( or diaspora , i guess if your family left prior to partition you may be neither , technically at least . . ), 
  [ they also planned to attack the serbian pm , vucic , too ] ( http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/10/30/did-moscow-botch-a-coup-in-montenegro/ ) . . 
  not exclusively though , appropriations of palestinian land are still taking place . 
  ( there was a recent article about a case currently going through a legal challenge , i 'm on mobile right now , but i 'm sure you 'd remember - it was linked to a speech by netanyahu calling for patience till obama finishes his term so as not to trigger a us presidential motion in the unsc . . ), 
  also , the fact that so much ( proportionally ) of the wb 's resources are controlled by the settlements , leading to pressure on palestinian society as fewer resources must be shared by more people is a long-term ethnic cleansing by degrees - in this context , even just more dwellings strictly within existing settlement boundaries means an even greater usage of resources ( notably water ) which ratchets up that societal pressure yet further . 
  it also causes outrage , which increases the tension and thus conflict between the indigenous population and the colonists , which is another path to encouraging more palestinian people to give up and leave . 
  certainly these activities are not as egregious as some might paint them , but nonetheless the overall effect is to place stress on the palestinians in order to help the settlers achieve their long-term colonialist objectives . 
  i tried to find one as an example , but i 'm at work so could n't in the quick search time i allowed myself . . 
  there are a whole bunch of different `` phantom phlyer '' , `` phabulous phantom '' and even `` phantom phixer '' patches easily found . 
  ( basically any ` f ' gets turned into a ` ph ' . . ), 
  whenever an af finally retires its phantom fleet they always come out with commemorative versions too . 
  edit : i meant to mention the retirements always bring out `` phantom pharewell '' patches , and often schemes on aircraft . . 
  looks like great fun , though perhaps less so coming out of an hot lz with bullets flying your way , being dragged through the tree tops !, 
  exactly , they actually [ painted `` phantom pharewell '' on their special schemes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/warplaneporn/comments/56a7l6/phantom_pharewell_from_the_lufwaffe_with_two_jets/ ) , and i 'm nearly 100 % positive i have seen the patches too . 
  i was thinking of numerous accounts from recon troops - macv-sog , usmc recon , lrrps , etc. . - in vietnam using one of the `` string '' extractions ( ie a technique where instead of the helicopter landing the troops clipped themselves onto a string underneath it ) while being extracted in the middle of a heavy contact , being shot at and dragged on the way out then sometimes having to fly considerable distances before being able to be safely loaded aboard the extraction helicopters properly . 
  in those cases , the `` string '' type extraction ( usmc force recon invented this specific spie system , according to wikipedia , but other techniques i have read about included ladders , stabo and so on ) was employed due to the intensity of ground fire , tight lzs in between trees in tiny clearings or simply extremely uneven terrain . .

  note : the above quoted response was with regards to the following question ( containing the list of countries that `` lack freedom of speech '' ) :, 
   have you been to canada , france , norway , sweden , australia , germany , etc. 
  the nerve of those bloody palestinians , wanting to harvest their olives and not giving a fuck that their colonialist oppressors - living in a hard-stolen ( cough , * absolutely * illegal , cough ) `` outpost '' - would have to put up with having icky palestinians being nearby , maybe even visible , just because those palestinians wanted to eat . . 
  the poor illegal colonialists must have felt horrified and feared for their lives watching as a group of palestinians approached their hard-stolen `` outpost '' ; it really is no wonder they lashed out in preemptive self-defence . 
  well , i for one hope * this * inquest follows the usual pattern and the israeli police throw the book at those palestinian bastards for this gross act of antisemitic terrorism !, 
  yes , you read right . 
  terrorism . 
  afaik , the qf-16s * have * taken over ; however , a handful of qf-4s ( they had four in various retro schemes , of which this aircraft pictured is one - wearing a post-vietnam three-tone sea , but with black tailcodes as worn in the '80s scheme ) are still being flown , though primarily for heritage flight duties . 
  the usaf labelled this as performing a flyby , so that would fit with the `` victim vipers '' taking on the victim role , which they have certainly achieved ioc for . 
  me too man , me too . . 
  well , not wanting to be get in an argument with you ( as you seem open to discussion instead of just arguing ) , but yes - if resources are scarce then limiting them can be viewed as at worst an act of aggression , but certainly an effort to make life intolerable ( whether as the primary objective or a side-effect , the result is the same . . ), 
  not all jews are colonists no , and i do not support that pov ( in your comments you have disproven that , if i may assume you are jewish ? 
  ) ; and yes , small numbers of settlers are arab israelis ; however , neither they not people like yourself ( based on the opinions/positions you have expressed ) are the problem . 
  have you watched louis theroux 's * extreme zionists * doco ? 
  it 's * those * guys we in the middle need to worry about . 
  thx . 
  i appreciate your reply , 
  i also appreciate your help the other week allowing my post through in r/israel . 
  i enjoy discussion and hate the effect my username has had given what 's happened since i created the account , so when people like you take me on what i say and not on that , or some perceived position based on the username , i both appreciate and respect it a lot . 
  did you try the potassium ? 
  does n't that depend entirely on how clean the water is in the street you happen to have chosen though ? 
   . . ; however , in practice , israel has an entirely inadequate separation of religion and politics , and is predicated on the concept of cryptofascist ultra-nationalism fuelled venal colonialist expansionism that utterly denies the palestinian people ( the region 's indigenous population ) any national self-determination whatsoever . 
  there , i finished that statement off to make it factual . 
  wait , that 's meant to be an argument against peace/for israel , right ? 
  so why the criticism of the settlements at the end there ? 
  oh , when you were talking about imperialism , i naturally assumed you were referring to the colonial project underway to displace the indigenous population of the west bank with immigrant settlers . 
  i have never heard of * any * of those people : are they `` canadian famous '' or something ? 
  sooo , how long * did * you wait ? 
  they sound like fun guys . . 
   is that why israel returned the entire sinai peninsula to egypt in exchange for a peace treaty ? 
  they did that for the billions of dollars in bribe money the us pays them , did n't they ? 
  and because yom kippur scared their little pants off of course . 
   is that why israel has been offering to return the golan heights to syria in exchange for a peace treaty , for decades, 
   syria could have got a deal like this . 
  maybe not so much the billions , but the land for peace . 
  maybe if that had happened , things in syria would be a lot better . 
  this is certainly inarguable . 
  syria should definitely have sought peace , and of course there is no way israel could unilaterally declare peace when syria was n't willing . 
  hmm , ok , what about scarlett johansson then ? 
  yep , definitely a drop bear , though his arm is hiding his fangs in this picture . . 
  it 's been about 5 years since i was last in vietnam , and idk about beers , but i can tell you even back then you could never get a bargirl with just 1 vd . . 
  i pay for 100/40 and i still want faster internet , i would definitely love to go up to 1gbps . 
  just actually getting what i pay for already would be a great start though . . 
  about bloody time . . 
  i think it 's implicit that pricing structure needs to change too . . 
  i wonder if sarah netanyahu wrote those criticisms , given the extent of her influence as revealed by the journalist in question ? 
   this is *** my *** toy and you ca n't play with it if i do n't want you to !!, 
  there , i rephrased his comment for clarity . 
  i * do * get high 70s down , but not when anyone else is awake of course . . 
  what does the vodka infusion in the crust do ? 
  can you taste it , or does it serve some other purpose ? 
  i know what i 'm hoping for , but also what i expect . . ( and they are n't the same outcomes . ), 
  these are definitely 82d aerial target squadron aircraft ; they 've had this four in these schemes for some time . 
  this is from the [ wikipedia article about the f-4 , regarding the aircraft pictured ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonnell_douglas_f-4_phantom_ii#united_states_air_force ) ( final paragraph of linked section ) :, 
   several qf-4s also retain capability as manned aircraft and are maintained in historical color schemes , being displayed as part of air combat command 's heritage flight at air shows , base open houses , and other events while serving as non-expendable target aircraft during the week . 
  so idk if it 's just these four that retained a seat in the back , or what the story is exactly . . 
  also , here is a great smithsonian air & space magazine article about qf-4 operations from before the qf-16s took over , though it does n't answer your question either : http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/where-have-all-the-phantoms-gone-96320627/?all, 
  hopefully someone else knows as my curiosity is now piqued too !, 
  fttp, 
  public . 
  nbn suffers congestion even fttp as i have . 
  caesar just made me laugh out loud - that expression !, 
  what are they , brimstones and some kind of arm is it ? 
  is that over korea ? 
  they look like they 're carrying a decent load under their fuselages . . 
  this is great imo , those payday loans are a dirty business that prey on those least able to afford it . 
  if you head south from perth there are a good selection of wineries , particularly around margaret river . 
  there are also microbreweries , and some fantastic restaurants . 
  further south , around denmark and albany is beautiful country too , and a bit less touristy imo . 
  for hiking , [ the porongurup hills ] ( https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/porongurup ) are stunning , and great places to stretch your legs . 
  if you were to head inland , kalgoorlie is interesting , and the [ sculptures at lake ballard ] ( http://lakeballard.com/ ) are very cool . 
  all the way along the coast , from the top of wa to the bottom , you 'll find beautiful beaches . 
  not me , but i found this `` sims sweatshop '' funny af :,
