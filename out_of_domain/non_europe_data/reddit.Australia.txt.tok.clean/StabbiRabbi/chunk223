  in other words , it 's not a sovereign state . 
  officially , within the uk scotland is referred to as a country , or a constituent country . 
  you did n't read the answers , did you ? 
  just below the sentence i provided you will find this bit of information :, 
   it 's quite possible to draw an analogy between the sub-divisions of the united kingdom and american states - they 're both sub-entities of a larger country which have the ability to run themselves within certain limits . 
  *** however , because scotland has a long history of being an independent country and the states do n't , the terminology is different . 
  [ emphasis my own . ], 
  from the official , government run , [ commonwealth website ] ( http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/united-kingdom ) :, 
   the uk is a union of four countries : england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  that . 
  the . 
  ** official ** . 
  position . 
  your `` examples '' are utterly irrelevant . 
  country is a somewhat ambiguous term , i will grant you that , but in normal english , as spoken by native english speakers the world over , scotland is a country . 
  edit : for more information , here is a link to the ** official ** scotland.org website too , see how they refer to themselves ( try looking at various pages , hitting ctrl-f and searching for `` country '' ) : http://www.scotland.org/about-scotland/facts-about-scotland, 
  also , here is the [ wikipedia page on scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland ) . 
  again , looking at the very first paragraph , we see the following :, 
   scotland ( / \u02c8sk\u0252t.l\u0259nd / ; scots : [ \u02c8sk\u0254t.l\u0259nd ] ; scottish gaelic : alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) *** is a country *** that is part of the united kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of great britain . 
  [ emphasis my own . ], 
   merriam webster . 
  you know , the dictionary, 
  the * american * dictionary . . 
  scotland does have its own government already anyway , with less powers than a sovereign nation would , but more than a us state possesses . 
  the states have never been independent countries , and can not become so under any existing constitutional mechanism ; therein lies the difference . 
   using the normal definition of a country , a completely self governing region , it is not one . 
  that is not * the * normal definition . 
  it is * a * definition ; however , in the case of scotland it is manifestly inadequate . 
  whatever you reckon . 
  ignore the official nomenclature . 
  ignore historical precedent . 
  ignore every common usage of the word country except the very narrow definitions you have found to support your `` argument '' . 
  the standard english dictionary is the oxford dictionary , i had never even heard of * cambridge dictionary * by the way . 
  scotland has it 's own flag , national sports team , and government . 
  you admitted you are ignorant of the official status , but hey , do n't let * that * stop you , right ? 
  tbh idgaf what you think . 
  if you ask anyone from the uk they will tell you scotland is a country , but you carry on thinking what you like . 
  i will definitely be keeping an eye on you for future comments where i have n't replied myself to post to sas ; you 're going to go down a treat there . 
  edit - [ here ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/country ) is the oxford english dictionary definition :, 
   a nation with its own government , occupying a particular territory . 
  there is definitely a scottish nation . 
  they have their own government , and they occupy a particular territory . 
  all three clauses satisfied . 
  sickening , all this gloating from the likes of netanyahu , bennett and shaked . 
  i very much hope obama uses the last couple of months of his term to introduce some unsc motions or us legislation that will wipe the smirks off their grubby faces . 
  well you conveniently omitted bennett , who was definitely rubbing his metaphorically blood stained hands in glee . . 
  taken in context gloating is certainly how i would describe the tone of the views expressed in toto . 
  where did you quote that vile bigot , bennett ? 
  when i read abbas 's tweet i can formulate an opinion , but personally i 'm under no illusions regarding that man either . 
  post an article and i 'll comment . 
  fair enough , nothing to disagree with there . 
  i often do n't disagree with you man , you 're far from the type of israeli i disagree with on principle . . 
  i mean , we have some vigorous discussions , sure , but i do n't think badly of you in general and i 'm not going to argue with you when i agree with your position . 
  size primarily , like the f-111 . 
  the usaf only really used the a designation for the a-10 ( which succeeded the navy a-1 in a competition known as a-x ) , otherwise all usaf a-n types are ex-navy : a-1 , a-7 and that 's about it off the top of my head - excepting the ac-n series of course . . 
  basically the system is kind of all over the place . 
  edit : case in point , look at the douglas skywarrior : a-3 in usn service , but b-66 destroyer once upgraded/updated for usaf purposes . 
  nope , this mob had adapted a payday loan system to target struggling small businesses - it was recent , and they 're a startup . . 
  same predatory business model to a tee . 
  ha ha , yeah . . perhaps . 
  should n't the a-6 have counted as a ` b ' though ? 
  i mean , it was the best light , all-weather bomber out when it entered service . . 
  i get that * is * an attack aircraft in usn parlance , but considering its actual capabilities and use it sure seems like a bomber to me . 
  they could do all the f-111 could ( albeit a tad slower ) years before ; great jets , the intruders . 
  that 's by the by though , the simple fact is the tri-service designation system is anything but consistent . . 
  depends where you 're coming from - albany or perth . . 
  the country around kalgoorlie is ( surprisingly ) nice too ; it 's the largest area of * woodland * ( not forest ) in the world . 
  why . . why have you kept a bottle of coke for that long ? 
  nah , this fully happens in germany . . 
  umm , i mean happened . 
  yes . 
  happened . 
  i told you mate , think whatever you like . 
  seppoes always struggle with this kind of thing , so do n't worry : you 're probably not autistic , just ill-educated . 
  i actually cooked ten , and some more of them * may * have found their way onto my plate not long after the photo was taken . . 
  i know you are , but what am i , right matey ? 
  please tell me you voted trump ; the only alternative i can see is i 've been arguing with some kid who * literally * lives with his folks . 
  i mean , septics * are * known for ignorance of the world outside the states , but this is some next level shit . . 
  when it comes to countries , scotland is officially called a country . 
  the union ( that created the united kingdom ) is an entirely different political entity from the federation that is the united states ( yes , they both have `` united '' in their names , but that is the greatest similarity . . ) and the constituent parts ( eg scotland ) have different definitions , rights and antecedents . 
  i have been very patient and polite with you , all things considered , while you , my friend , need to wipe the flecks of spittle from around your mouth . 
  you seem to have taken against me for some reason , though what that might be exactly is hard to discern from your tautologous ramblings , so , instead of taking my word for it , why do n't you go and ask in one of the uk or europe related subs ? 
  if you do , please reference my username ( with `` u / '' included so i get the username mention notification ) or pm me a link : i 'd love to watch . 
  shit , that just happened - maybe they are shutting down traffic from here ? 
  i can rehost it and repost it in a comment in about half an hour if you 'd like to see it ? 
  you see that ? 
  that 's america becoming great again . . 
  rehosted link as the original host seems to be blocking traffic from here : http://sli.mg/pjbcep, 
  thanks to u/sideshowjack for pointing this out . . 
  i like these planes , as ungainly as they may look . 
  they were part of a wave of very significant new capabilities and their legacy is still massively important today with the descendents , the c-17 globemaster iiis , fulfilling a vital role . 
  where was this taken ? 
  those are rocaf roundels on the rf-101 behind , is this in taiwan or the states ?

  that 's cool , i 'm glad you saw it . 
  have you seen the picture before ? 
  i was trying to work out who the other guys were , and thought the bloke in the middle was another aussies ( though i think the guy on the right is usn/usmc ? ) . 
  i bet they are a great bunch to sink pints with .
