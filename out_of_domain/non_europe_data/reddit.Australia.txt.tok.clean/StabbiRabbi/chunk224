  i 've met quite a few aussie vietnam vets between my dad 's mates , my mates ' dads and other blokes both here and when i have been over in vietnam on holiday ( the bars around vung tau are full of aussies , with heaps of the restaurants catering to us to the point they have the names of aussie places like `` eats '' , `` captain munchies '' , `` ned kelly 's '' , `` ettamogah pub '' and so on . . ) and found them all to be good blokes , with some great stories ( though they 're often too humble to share until you get comfortable with each other ) . 
  yeah , an osprey gunship seems like such an obvious move - the escort helicopters ca n't keep up , or match the range so unless fast jets are tasked they often have to fly unescorted . 
  they have experimented with pallet based systems for belly turrets , but these were n't deemed sufficiently useful for the weight penalty they incurred and never saw much use as a result . . 
  [ source article on the testing of robot tech by us army ] ( https://www.army.mil/article/172442/soldiers_test_robot_tech_during_visit_by_army_secretary_fanning ) . 
  yeah , it 's hard to work out what happened , is n't it ? 
  do n't these grenades require a certain number of spins as they fly to arm themselves after launch ? 
  obviously it 's still a live grenade , but it not being armed would explain why those blokes are all just standing around it so casually !, 
  great , thanks for the link/book tip - you can tell your mate you just made a sale for his dad . 
  i read a lot , and find our involvement in vietnam fascinating . 
  i have read of tony ey before actually , he 's quite prominent in that ran community i believe ? 
  while the role played by the ran detachments is not nearly as well known as that of 1atf or the raaf , it 's bloody interesting . 
  i 've already read * incredible navy divers : in vietnam * by gregor salmon and another book by a ran helicopter pilot who flew with a joint ran/us army assault helicopter company ( that was established and operated in the mekong delta for a number of years during the war ) , both of which i really enjoyed , so i am very happy to learn of this book too . 
  that 's exactly why i find the ran stuff from vietnam especially interesting , it really is n't a well-known capability despite the amount these guys have seen action over the years . 
  the book about the ran helicopter detachment that formed the [ 135th ahc ] ( http://www.135ahc.net/about-us/ ) with the us army is steve eather 's * [ get the bloody job done ] ( https://books.google.com.au/books/about/get_the_bloody_job_done.html?id=2edabaaaqbaj&amp;redir_esc=y ) * if you 're interested ; that 's another very little known chapter of australia 's involvement in the war . 
  i wonder whether they will still * want * to go to the usa , given the uncertainty that trump 's shadow would already be casting over any such agreement ? 
  i mean , obviously getting off manus must be a massive priority , but would they just be out of the frying pan and into the fire ? 
  that was how it was attributed where i found it . . 
  russian designations are very different from western systems , and can be very opaque as a non-russian speaker . 
  they place radar reflectors on stealth aircraft during transit . 
  oh yeah , horseradish on the side . 
  * heaps * of horseradish . 
  ikr , who are these people who get amazed by such everyday occurrences anyway ? 
  navel oranges have to be one of the most over-posted `` things '' on this sub . . 
  medium * rare * , though definitely on the rare side of that spectrum !, 
  crew chiefs also have their names on the aircraft quite often , that must be the case here . 
  i bought this as a whole scotch fillet that i then cut into steaks . 
  the first pair of steaks i cooked off it , the pan had just had chorizo cooked in it ( a very nice , proper spanish style chorizo ) , with the oil still being in the pan - that gave a beautiful caramelisation on the steaks and a nice bit of flavour too . 
  i used a non-stick griddle pan that does n't * need * oil , but it does actually benefit from just a touch for the effect you 're talking about . 
  still tastes great without any , but certainly just that bit better with . . 
  it actually has rvnaf markings - they used a very similar roundel , but with different colours , as can be seen clearly in [ this colour photo of a restored example ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8159/7168296326_4aaca41f77_b.jpg ) . 
  if you notice the tone of the bars in the b & w photo i posted is not the us white , but would rather be the rvnaf yellow background . 
  good picks ; horseradish is the best , and vinegar goes with everything . . 
  i have never tried vinegar on horseradish , but vinegar makes up excellent dressings for salad/veggies , as well a being essential for chips !, 
  depends on the country and the unit . 
  australian cut of steak , you guys call ribeye . 
  is that question meant ironically ? 
  welp . 
  * you 're * not coming to any of * our * parties then !, 
  unless of course you only report people hitting their own kids , but are fine with people hitting * other * peoples ' kids ? 
  yeah , we call it ribeye when it 's on the bone here , or a tomahawk on a long bone . 
  ( as i believe you guys do too ? ), 
  i bought this as a big chunk that could be roasted whole or sliced into steaks , choosing to slice steaks out of it . 
  that sounds good !, 
  the tomahawk tends to be served in restaurants ( i have eaten them in restaurants , but never seen it done at home ) and it 's a long bone , around 1 ' long !, 
  ( really looks like a tomahawk . . ), 
  we call bone in ribeye , but that 's just the short cut bone about the length of the steak , not that much longer . 
  animated gifs , animated gifs as far as the eye can see , is my advice . . 
  manning 's ( publisher ) [ dependency injection in . net ] ( https://www.manning.com/books/dependency-injection-in-dot-net ) by mark seeman is an excellent book on the subject , that covers both the underlying patterns and various ioc containers . 
  wtf do these have to do with * israel * ? 
  they were found by arabs in palestine and much of the material is gnostic : israel claiming ownership is simply the worst kind of cultural appropriation possible , related as it is to the twisted colonialist dreams of a genocidal apartheid regime . 
  i guess in the same way racism in the uk following brexit , or us following trump 's election is , right ? 
  in that sense i think the link to israel 's own extreme right wing demagogue is fairly apparent . 
  it 's very tenuous . 
  i mean , within the spectrum of healthcare systems the nhs and obamacare are at opposite poles . . 
  that is definitely a factor ; however , ( anecdotally ) i have noticed the tone here , for example , has swung more towards open bigotry and unashamed racism among a small , but vocal , section of the community . 
  i think perhaps such people have been emboldened by what they see as their `` vindication '' . . 
  piss standing up ? 
  they can even do that , it 's just a bit awkward . 
  that is what i have my fingers permanently crossed for at the moment too . . 
  come on obama , do the right thing !, 
  your dark lord , bennett , will keep pushing for this though , sure as night follows day . . 
  come on the obama , stop just mouthing platitudes and use your last months to do some good - open up the unsc to muzzling the mad dog that is israel 's polity !, 
  not literally * you * personally as an individual , but israel 's dark lord was what i intended . . 
  scarcely on the fringe though , is he ? 
  i mean he * is * ensconced firmly within the present regime 's inner `` security cabinet '' , and he 's far from alone from tjhp in that , but is rather accompanied by most of the other tjhp mks ( within the complete cabinet at least , though he 's not the only tjhp mk in the security cabinet either . . ) !, 
  i can nazi why not ? 
  breitbart is constantly offering up zionist apologia of the most virulently bigoted variety ; it 's one of r/israel 's favourite sites . 
  some of their readers may be anti-semitic , but i do n't think breitbart are as an organisation . 
  those little white uniform socks though . . 
  the tigers did pretty well in vietnam , with some examples serving on with the vpaf post-war even . 
  lovely little jets imo . 
  ah , the famous searottie in its element , what a magnificent beast !, 
  lucky to get away with taking pictures , any closer in and you might have been `` dissuaded '' . . 
  that made absolutely no sense whatsoever . . 
  that 's losing the avocado lottery right there . . 
  do you know what type of missiles these are ? 
  again ( as per the tornado you posted last week ) the inboard ones look like an arm rather than an air-to-air missile , is that correct ? 
  cheers , plaaf weaponry is n't something i know all that well . 
  maybe it 's just the angle , but i thought it kind of looks as though it has a similar form factor to a harm in this picture , but then from the wiki link it 's clearly the pl-12 . 
   a u.s. navy mcdonnell f-4b-9-mc phantom ii ( buno 149426 ) of fighter squadron vf-143 `` pukin ' dogs '' aboard the aircraft carrier uss bon homme richard ( cva-31 ) . 
  vf-143 was assigned to carrier air wing 14 ( cvw-14 ) aboard the uss constellation ( cva-64 ) . 
   this aircraft landed either by mistake or due to an emergency aboard the small essex-class carrier which did not operate the f-4 . 
   it was common to paint `` visiting '' aircraft with comments ( see : `` down bird '' ; `` train your troops '' ; `` if you ca n't fly 'em park 'em '' ; `` captured by the bonnie dick cva 31 '' ) .

  sorry , should have posted it without prompting . . 
  it 's now added [ as a comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/warplaneporn/comments/5dd367/f4_phantom_ii_pictured_after_landing_on_the_wrong/da3rtot/ ) , the link 's here so you can go straight to it instead of having to navigate through , 
  that 's such a well timed shot , it 's very cool . 
  we are n't spying on you , you have nothing to worry about . 
  * trust me * . . 
  title captures the image perfectly . 
  i 'm not sure , it 's hard to tell exactly from the angle the shot is taken , is n't it ? 
  whatever it is it 's quite large !, 
  a torpedo could fit . 
  the navy operated mitchells too , so perhaps it was a test for them ? 
  i have seen all of those helicopters ( types in rnzaf/rnzn service ) display at wanaka - the nh90 is impressive close up too . 
  both it and the aw109 have full glass cockpits - quite a jump from the steam gauges the hueys that were flown until recently employed in their cockpits . 
  oooh israel is going to be * pissed * !, 
  al-nusrah are their bestest buddies . . 
  anything a palestinian does is classed as terrorism by many israelis . 
  call to prayer ?
