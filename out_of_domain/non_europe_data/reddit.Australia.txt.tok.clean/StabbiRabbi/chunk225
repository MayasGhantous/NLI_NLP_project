  that 's terrorism . 
  taking the kids to school ? 
  terrorism . 
  legitimate resistance against a vicious occupying regime with the morals of a sewer rat ? 
  yep , you guessed it : terrorism . . 
  what 's with the `` almost '' ?

  afaik there is no practical reason . 
  the pilots just carry them , usually when they know photos will be taken . 
   `` zoa 's own experience and analysis of breitbart articles confirms mr. bannon 's and breitbart 's friendship and fair-mindedness toward israel and the jewish people . 
  to accuse mr. bannon and breitbart of antisemitism is orwellian , '', 
  as per usual the hypocrisy stinks . 
  accusations of antisemitism are fine whenever it suit the machinations of groups such as zoa , but when its one of their sacred cow bigots under examination such accusations are suddenly `` orwellian '' ? 
  lol . 
  also , this has been reported before , but obviously the jpost are so excited by it they just could n't resist repeating this charming insight into the regime 's thinking :, 
   on monday , bennett said trump 's victory was an opportunity to `` rest and rethink everything . '' last week he said the election means the `` era of a palestinian state is over . '', 
  let 's not kid ourselves by imagining for a moment that bennett would ever entertain the notion of extending israeli citizenship to the native population of the territory he covets so extremely . 
  that leaves two option open : ethnic cleansing on a massive scale , or apartheid within israel proper . 
  i guess the apologists ' favourite figleaf of `` it 's not apartheid coz military occupation '' is no longer required in regime leaders ' minds , any more than is any pretence of respecting those pesky , inconvenient international laws and treaties . 
  remind me , who is it that lacks a `` partner for peace '' again ? 
  i very much doubt it , this was taken during training and that seems very close to the swimmers . . 
  i imagine him thinking `` exxxxxcellent '' to himself , mr burns style , as he plots his next evil act . . 
  boy , i bet you 're * fun * in person too . . 
  gorgeous . 
  that 's one extreme of transport technology to another , camels vs aviation . . 
  australian soldiers did wear us m1 helmets , but usually only in defensive positions , there is a picture of aussie soldiers manning a bunker during tet in ' 68 , wearing helmets and flak jackets at the top of this page : http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/tet-offensive/index.php, 
  however , as others have mentioned , they wore soft hats on patrol because they are lighter and allow for better hearing than helmets do . 
  the australian style of jungle patrolling was very different to us patrol tactics , rooted in years of experience acquired from wwii , through actions in malaya/malaysia and indonesia and carried into vietnam . 
  not wearing helmets was part of the doctrine evolved from these experiences . 
  here is a good site , with a lot of information about australia 's involvement : http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/, 
  the primary effort was the deployment of a brigade sized task force - 1atf ( 1 australian task force ) - to phuoc tuy province , just to the south of saigon made up of three infantry battalions ( at its strongest ) , sas troopers , artillery , cavalry and armour with personnel also coming from the nz army too . 
  in common with us practice , each soldier served a one year tour of duty , although unlike american troops the battalions rotated as complete units rather than each man serving his year independently . 
  within their assigned ao the aussies conducted a much more pure counter-insurgency style of warfare than was carried out elsewhere , due to doctrine and circumstances . 
  it worked well in phuoc tuy , which was turned around from being a hotbed of communist activity to being largely pacified following the task force 's actions in the province . 
  the raaf deployed a number of units to vietnam too , some of which operated primarily with 1atf ( eg no 9 squadron , a huey helicopter squadron ) , some of which supported both 1atf and other allied units as required ( there was a caribou transport squadron , known as `` wallaby air '' ) while others were entirely independent ( eg no 2 squadron which flew canberra bombers - martin b-57s in usaf service - from phan rang bay for a decade , gaining an impressive reputation for accuracy and operating wherever needed ) . 
  a squadron of sabres was also based in thailand to fly cap over usaf bases in the country until the usaf had sufficient resources in country to provide its own protection from any north vietnamese intrusion/interference . 
  the royal australian navy provided destroyers for the gun line up and down the coast and undertook a great deal of logistical support , ferrying troops and equipment between australia and vung tau where the 1alsg ( 1 australian logistics support group ) were based . 
  less well known are units such as the [ 135th assault helicopter company ] ( http://www.135ahc.net/ ) , which was a joint us army/royal australian navy helicopter company , or the ran clearance divers . 
  yeah , it 's quite stylised , but the outline is still unmistakeable . 
  i think it 's really cool . . 
  it 's scarcely a rant , and i do n't seek to tell anyone what is acceptable to think or not . 
  i simply shared my view of the article , and explained why i posted it . 
  afaik there is no rule saying those that contribute content are disallowed opinions , is there ? 
  not factual information , but there is an excellent alternative history novel ( written around the premise that germany did not lose wwii ) by robert harris called * [ fatherland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatherland_ ( novel \\ ) ) * that features globocnick as a key character . 
  if you 're interested in the man then i would recommend the book - it 's very well written , and harris evidently researched the ( real life history of the ) subject very thoroughly . 
  and yes , globocnick is a vile man , both in the novel and in reality , from what i know of him ( which is basically just what i gleaned from the book and subsequent reading of [ wikipedia 's article about him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odilo_globocnik ) . 
  corruption is so endemic to indian culture that any warning would have negated the intended benefits entirely as the indian talent for corruption would have led to all kinds of tactics being employed to undermine the project . 
  of course , while well intentioned , the entire exercise as implemented is utterly shambolic , but given it is being carried out by the indian government that is essentially axiomatic anyway . 
  i sea what you did there . . 
  rebreather so no bubbles escape . 
  farms always used to have wwii surplus .303 lee-enfield rifles too when i was a kid - first time shooting a gun was when i was pretty young , laid down with a .303 on dad 's counsin 's farm . . 
  yeah , there are a fair few lovingly wrapped in oily rags , buried on rural properties without a doubt . . 
  when you 're totally immersed in something it 's hard to truly see it , kind of a woods for trees thing . 
  you are simply so comfortable with the caste system you do n't even notice it . 
  you probably say `` suttee is quite rare '' too . . 
  pakistan has far fewer open defectors than india , where open defecation is actually preferred to the use of toilets . 
  no , they do it because they like it . 
  i do n't see how an app can change such a deep-rooted cultural preference either . 
  pakistan is a country in asia . 
  people from pakistan are therefore people from an asian country . 
  people from an asian country are * asian * . 
  see , that was n't too hard , was it ? 
  edit : autocorrect strikes again . . 
  south park had this covered years ago , with terrence & philip and their fart jokes . 
  that 's true as in an individual seppo would * never * go toe-to-toe in an evenly matched 1-v-1 fight , but he means it as in everything is binary , black-or-white , this one or that one . . 
  i get it . 
  we hate canadians heaps too , here in australia . 
  i 'm not disputing that it 's underreported , if that 's what you 're trying to say , but the article above lists a 2008 reported case as well as a 1999 - both less than 22 years . 
  so even your excuse of `` we do n't talk about it '' ( `` never heard of sati today '' to use your exact excuse ) / `` it 's not reported '' does n't hold up now , does it ? 
  those are only the reported incidents . 
  happens all the time though . 
  quite . 
  did n't happen under the raj , but started again almost immediately following independence . 
  very well known facts . 
  no , i believe indians speak standard english ( just poorly , with a silly accent ) , do n't they ? 
  whether or not english is their second language , indians still speak with a funny accent , but using the same words as we native anglophones , ie not a patois or anything . 
  your comment is practically a non sequitur and absolutely fails to refute my previous comment . 
  my former flat mate believed all of this shit , and * explained * it all to me - the names in caps , admiralty law , not paying cc debts , the full bit - long before i learned what it was actually all about . 
  even , perhaps especially , out of context it sounds batshit insane ; it was very funny when i came across the explanation/theory behind it all . 
  i do n't know if he still believes , would n't be surprised . 
  he had always been a bit `` prickly '' , but until this started coming out he did n't actually appear nuts . 
  he also was convinced that the way to financial success was buying up silver , which he would , in ingots from the conveniently located local mint , whenever he had cash to do so . 
  needless to say , the expected triple digit increase in value of silver is still pending !, 
  edit : spelling and the silver bit , i 'd forgotten about that as this was about 8yrs ago . 
  except why * would * a natural english speaker concern oneself with such things ? 
  i will never have to worry about l2 english , will i ? 
  and parsley , as may be seen poking out . . 
  the [ 135th assault helicopter company ] ( http://www.135ahc.net/ ) was unique in that it was comprised of royal australian navy sailors and us army soldiers in a joint unit . 
  the unit operated mainly in the southern part of south vietnam , in the iii/iv corps tactical zones , and often within the mekong delta . 
  the unit enjoyed a great deal of success , with the combination of ran sailors and us army soldiers working together solidly as an effective team . 
  as well as the [ 135th ahc association ] ( http://www.135ahc.net/ ) link posted above , [ here is the story as told by the ran ] ( http://www.navy.gov.au/history/squadron-histories/ran-helicopter-flight-vietnam-history ) . 
  there is also an excellent book about this unit : [ * get the bloody job done * ] ( https://www.amazon.com.au/get-bloody-job-done-flight-vietnam-ebook/dp/b00n1jtpqm ) by steve eather . 
  it 's funny to us , but i had mates who would listen to my former flat mate 's ramblings about silver and had been considering investing themselves , based on his lunatic advice . 
  happily they did n't , but the silver thing is a big deal with these guys and they are entirely convinced it 's the path to instant riches !, 
  my former flat mate did n't possess the kind of set up your friend has built up - back then at least . . 
  the [ tri-service designation scheme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_united_states_tri-service_aircraft_designation_system ) was adopted in 1962 to make equipment designations uniform across all service branches .
