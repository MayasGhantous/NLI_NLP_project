  until this system was implemented , the [ mcdonnell ( later mcdonnell douglas , and ultimately boeing ) model 98 ] ( http://wiki.scramble.nl/index.php/mcdonnell_douglas_f-4_phantom_ii_-_mcdonnell_model_designators ) phantom ii was have been designated the [ f4h phantom ii in us navy service , while the usaf planned on naming their copies the f-110a spectre ] ( http://www.f-4.nl/f4_7.html ) ; that is why f-100a may be seen painted uder the cockpit of this early example . 
  [ vfc-13 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vfc-13 ) `` saints '' are a us navy adversary squadron , based at [ nas fallon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_air_station_fallon ) , nevada , where they support the [ naval strike and air warfare center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_strike_and_air_warfare_center ) ( nsawc ) . 
  nsawc is the center of excellence for naval aviation training and tactics development and runs schools such as [ topgun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_navy_strike_fighter_tactics_instructor_program ) , which vfc-13 are an essential component of . 
  the scheme worn by this particular vfc-13 aggressor f-5e tiger ii , as well as the `` you were in a 4g inverted dive with a mig28 ? '', 
  quote in the title are , as i am sure everybody knows , both from the [ * topgun * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/quotes ) movie . .

  [ story of the mayaguez incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayaguez_incident ) , the last official us battle of the vietnam war . 
  this is taken from a 135th assault helicopter company `` taipans '' ( gunship platoon ) uh-1c while they were based at [ camp bearcat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bearcat_base ) , which was near bien hoa and in the same iii corps tactical zone as the iron triangle and cu chi ; it 's perfectly possible that is exactly what this depicts . . 
  b-52s were used quite extensively in support of troops within south vietnam as part of [ operation arc light ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_arc_light ) , which also involved the bombing of the ho chi minh trail and base areas in laos and cambodia . 
  if you read vietnamese veterans ' accounts ( perhaps the classic account of the war from the perspective of an nva bo doi is * [ the sorrow of war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sorrow_of_war ) * by bao ninh , which includes mention of such raids ' after effects ) of being on the receiving end it sounds absolutely horrific ; it was apparently quite effective in disrupting the nva 's rear area operations . 
  to this day in vietnam ( well , at least there were five or so years ago ) there are places where this type of cratering is still clearly visible out of plane windows . 
  well , it 's hard to tell from this picture , but most b-52 raids in the souh were against ( suspected ) troop concentrations , base areas and/or logistics . 
   at least there will be an inquiry by the knesset . 
  that will ensure that if anything illegal happened that it will be brought to light . 
  lol . 
  i admire your optimism . 
  well * those * maps do n't count !, 
  so there !, 
  x-post r/aww, 
  seeing as we 're near xmas , [ fruit mince pies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mince_pie ) and other raisin heavy xmas fare such as [ christmas pudding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_pudding ) / [ christmas cake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_cake ) pairs nicely with anything sherried , which the aberfeldy is enough for that to work . 
  ( links provided as i do n't know where you 're from , but do know these are n't eaten everywhere , eg the usa . . ), 
  your original comment makes very little sense , now i see why . 
  if you click the link you may then read the content - this incident is not even the first derailment in india to cause casualties * this year * , let alone the only one to cause casualties ever ( which appears to be what you were trying to claim ! ) . 
  the railways ran well when their builders were around to make sure they were operated properly , but these days if someone offered me a ride on an indian train i would wonder what exactly they had against me !, 
  what ? 
  can you not read english properly ? 
   05 february 2016 - 4 coaches of kanyakumari-bangalore city express derailed near vellore . 
  ** few injured ** . 
   06 may 2016 - side collision for the chennai central - thiruvananthapuram central superfast and a suburban train near pattabiram . 
  ** seven injured **, 
  that 's two casualty causing incidents right there !!, 
   hmm , if you 're british i 'm not even gon na debate with you wankers . 
  bigoted much ? 
   i meant death . 
  okay ? 
  why did n't you write `` death '' then ? 
  i bet you support the settlers of [ amona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amona,_mateh_binyamin ) though , despite even the * israeli * court system ( not known for dispensing justice or administering law in the traditional , western sense of the terms ) [ finding their `` outpost '' to be illegal ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/israel-court-denies-request-amona-settlement-161114141337901.html ) right ? 
  very good , carry on . 
  not * all * israelis are born evil . . 
  i asked a question , you answered satisfactorily and i informed you you could carry on - i think the interaction has reached a natural state of completion . 
  you have this the wrong way round : one is granted a visa ( allowed to stay ) for meeting the criteria . 
  it 's a privilege not a right though , and if those criteria are subsequently breached the privilege is withdrawn . 
  love the logo , and that wing has a great history ( including [ operation bolo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_bolo ) under col - later brigadier - [ robin olds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robin_olds ) in vietnam ) . . 
  or bay of pigs and indonesia - let alone the other big one for the invader ( korea ) !, 
  yep , i really like the invader 's lines - a great looking plane and very effective . . 
  douglas were on a roll from about the middle of wwii through to when they merged with mcdonnell , producing some of my favourite planes ever - notably including the mighty skyraider , the invader and the skyhawk . . 
  these counter invaders look awesome , and encapsulate why the air war in vietnam is such an interesting period for me , sitting as it did as the nexus between modern air warfare - with pgms , electronic sensors , awacs , etc - and wwii . 
  ha ha , looking at your flair i do sometimes wonder . . 
  iirc they would sometime not even fly with minigun ammo loaded as the 7.62 mm was n't effective once the pavn started placing serious aaa along the trail and the gunships had to fly higher to stay out of range . . 
  ah , r/israel where multiple wrongs * always * make a right ( unless committed against israelis , natch ) and users such as u/rosinthebow vigorously defend that `` right '' , from their ( unintentionally ironic ) ultra-right-wing-extremist perspective . . 
  nice . 
  i concur : google had a definition for it , and it 's in the oxford english dictionary , so i think that pretty much makes it a word . 
  i think that 's what they were going for . . 
  that 's the road where you see all the seals basking on the rocks , is n't it ? 
  looking through your post history i can see why you 'd want that . . 
  that 's an interesting source , cheers for the link !, 
   `` the iranian al-quds force packs weapons , ammunition and missile technology to hezbollah in suitcases and puts them on mahan air flights . '', 
  all i can say is that those iranians must manufacture some massive suitcases , if they are able to pack anything bigger than small arms ( which are already endemic in the region anyway ) into them !, 
  would love some actual proof , rather than just the foaming at the mouth rantings of an israeli government figure . . 
  amazing coincidence that this was just discovered as iran purchasing airliners has been in the news . 
  that looks interesting , i 'd love to find a copy . 
  i have also read a couple of accounts written by ac-130a crew members from the vietnam war which were really interesting too : * [ spectre gunner : the ac-130 gunship ] ( https://www.amazon.com/spectre-gunner-gunship-david-burns/dp/1475969724 ) * by david m. burns and * [ callsign spectre ] ( https://www.amazon.com/callsign-spectre-jeff-noecker/dp/1462004822/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=0yrbtj13xvrz2s7pxjf3 ) * by jeff noecker . 
  both give some interesting insights into their operations . 
   if nazis had focused on arabs then they would have been pretty swell guys really . 
  i think we can all accept that as axiomatic really , guided as we are by such clear thinking individuals as u/rosinthebow . . 
  did they have to wear special shoes too ? 
  i would wear special shoes on the streets of delhi just walking to the shop , let alone running a half-marathon !, 
  could n't we just ban catholics full stop ? 
  `` stars and bars '' captures not only the flag 's design , but also the nation 's incredibly high incarceration rates . . 
  whaddaya mean `` breaks character '' . . ? 
  for being catholic . . 
  is that not reason enough ? 
  what have any of them done wrong though ? 
  that amphitheatre in pula is amazing , very well preserved . 
  no , i said the reason to ban catholics is because they are catholics . . 
  issues such as the child abuse endemic within catholic institutions aside , did you not study history at school ? 
   remember , remember , the 5th of november, 
   the gunpowder treason and plot ;, 
   i know of no reason why gunpowder treason, 
   should ever be forgot . 
  do i really have to spell this out for you ? 
  catholics can not be trusted . 
  they owe their allegiance to the pope , not australia - as it was in 1605 , so it is today . 
  the child abuse and etc is simply another manifestation of these predilections : catholics behave according to the mores and morals of rome , not as we here in australia believe to be right . 
  so , questions of who made the cheeses aside , which cheeses did you include in the platter ? 
  tbh it 's not hard to spend that kind of money on cheese . . 
   is there something netanyahu knows that we do n't ? 
  the * exact * nature and schedule of the israeli regime 's plans to annex the west bank/east jerusalem , and how the associated ethnic cleansing is to be undertaken ? 
  the most cogent interpretation in r/israel from this story is that netanyahu wishes to avoid an even more demagogic than himself member of the regime cutting some kind of horrendous deal allowing israel free-rein in palestine , thus undercutting netanyahu 's own grip on power . . 
  edit : rephrased to address u/bradygoat _ manninghgh 's concerns, 
  they are things that have happened because the pope has influenced his followers to violate the principles of the societies they live in . . 
  do you really think catholic priests would be abusing kids to the extent they traditionally have if they could marry ? 
  how is that * not * related to catholic doctrine ? 
  very nice selection - i would honour the effort you put into arrangement by eating the crap out of the platter !, 
  not to mention maintenance . 
  types and so on as required by high performance cars are expensive in and of themselves , as well as servicing and other running costs . 
  insurance would be the killer at op 's age though , definitely . 
  so fucking kids is cool according to the 10 commandments , right ? 
  because it 's cool af as far as rome goes , if one judges by actions rather than platitudes . 
  also the article was satire , and i have just been pulling your leg with some good old fashioned anti-catholic prejudice .
