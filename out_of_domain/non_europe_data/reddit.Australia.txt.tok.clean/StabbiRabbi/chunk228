  i 'm sorry , but i do n't follow . . 
  would you mind explaining what exactly you are trying to get at ? 
  they have the same face !, 
  sure , why not , i mean everything else is terrorism when it happens in * israel * . . 
  truly the dark subcontinent . . 
  i am going to rome next month , ca n't wait !, 
  * two, 
  act of god , indicating anger at israel 's criminal regime ? 
  seriously though ( obviously there is no god , though if there were i 'm sure he * would * be ** pissed ** ) , even in the r/israel megathread about these fires nobody is saying terrorist arson attack , so yeah . . 
  fires happen , not just in summer and not just in israel . 
  strange conclusion . 
  this is because israel has a program of colonialist expansionism underway in the occupied west bank , including east jerusalem . . 
  especially in banana-bender land it seems . . 
  well , that 's because the rest of the world ( with a couple of notable exceptions . . ) does n't build the same literal/metaphorical walls ( of ignorance ) around their countries . . 
  we * have * been having some great sunsets recently ; my apartment faces due west and is only blocked from the beach ( ~ 1.5-2 km distant ) by a single ridgeline , so i get to enjoy pretty much this every evening . . 
  i love getting home from work , pouring a stiff vodka , lime and soda and sitting out there watching it go down . 
  perfect way to wipe the day 's stresses clear and unwind before cooking dinner and getting stuck into the scotch . 
  india and israel 's possession of nuclear weapons - of all the nuclear states in the world these are the two most likely to involve themselves in a nuclear exchange , controlled as they both are by insane extreme-right-wing-religio-nationalist regimes . . 
  friend 's parents ' house while a kid ; he and i lit some xmas candles under a string of xmas cards , then promptly left the room to play elsewhere . 
  some small time later i happened to wander back into the room where we had lit the candles , to find the whole wall ablaze . . 
  cue nine year old me going into where our parents were enjoying xmas libations :, 
  `` excuse me mr xxx , but i think your living room is on fire . '', 
  needless to say much hilarity ensued . 
  this was in the uk ; i now live in australia , but my mate has recently been elevated to the british house of lords and is now lord xxx of xxx , despite these early dalliances with arson . 
  i ca n't wait for a wave of disgruntled seps to try moving here , to australia . 
  i will be literally lmfao when i see the footage of them locked up on manus island with all the other illegal asylum seekers , most of whom happen to be muslims , fingers poking through the fence as they gaze forlornly at the camera . . 
  that shit will be priceless . 
  hell , next seppo tourist i see ( well , probably hear , right ? 
  ) , i 'm going to shop them to the dept of immigration so they at least get to spend a few hours in the cells , whether their visa is in order or not . 
  this is fucking heartbreaking , that poor kid ( not to mention his family . . ) . 
  i ca n't claim it 's an issue i give much consideration to regularly , but if anything is proof positive we do n't want a stupid plebiscite about same-sex marriage , this is it . 
  gay marriage needs to just be passed by parliament ; the last thing anyone except the bigots out there need is a long-winded public debate about gays , as such a debate will indubitably encourage the kind of cunts that drove this bloke to take his own life at fucking 13 to new heights of harassment of their victims !, 
  not my country , not here . 
  please . 
  politicians need to grow a pair and deal with it . 
  ha ha , that 's one interpretation ; a kind of small scale , pre-emptive gunpowder plot you think ? 
  actually i think the westminster system is good , and like that it is the basis for the australian political system . 
  having politicians who are not beholden to voters ' vagaries is actually a good thing , when it is not the main engine of political power . 
  it gives a nice degree of insulation for the upper house ( or in australia 's case the head of state at least ) from demagoguery and populism . 
  of course the elected pollies are the ones really holding the reins and steering , which is as it should be , but the politicians who are not elected per se provide a nice brake built into the system . 
  i was actually thinking of drawing that exact same analogy , yes . 
   australian , new zealand and united states forces were involved in a series of actions between may and june 1968 at fire support bases coral and balmoral some 20 kilometres north of bien hoa city . 
  sitting astride a route used by north vietnamese and viet cong forces approaching or departing saigon and nearby bien hoa , the bases comprised defended positions for artillery , mortars and armoured vehicles which in turn supported infantry patrols of the area . 
   the north vietnamese launched several strong attacks in an attempt to drive the australians from this important area . 
  the australians also initiated combat during their many patrols outside the bases . 
  these actions , over a 25-day period , made up australia 's costliest and most protracted battle of the vietnam war . 
  allied casualties were :, 
   ** australia ** : 25 killed , 99 wounded, 
   ** new zealand ** : 5 wounded, 
   ** us ** : 5 wounded, 
  nva/vc losses were estimated at 267 killed ( confirmed ) , 7 wounded , 11 captured . 
  [ source , including full details of the battle via links to the various sub-engagements that occurred during the period fsb coral was fought over ] ( http://vietnam-war.commemoration.gov.au/combat/coral-balmoral.php ) . 
  for further information , [ here is the wikipedia article too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_coral%e2%80%93balmoral ) . 
  i love this stuff , they do the crackling perfectly from good chinese bbq places . . 
  i will often get a mix of the red char siu bbq pork with roast pork such as this when i buy lunch from the chinese bbq near my work when i eat there - such good value and so tasty !, 
  i really enjoy persian food too , my favourite being [ fesenjan ] ( http://www.mypersiankitchen.com/khoresht-fesenjan-persian-pomegranate-and-walnut-stew/ ) , a stew made with walnuts a pomegrantes . 
  also great from vietnamese restaurants ( among many , many other dishes ) is [ bo luc lac ] ( http://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2008/05/wok-seared-shak.html ) , aka shaking beef , the salt and pepper squid ( actually , most seafood dishes from good vietnamese restaurants are a good bet - assuming one enjoys seafood , of course ) and those bbq pork cutlets with lemongrass they do . . 
  i really enjoy levantine/eastern mediterranean cuisine too ; as well as the three you mentioned , balkan cuisine ( which shares many characteristics and dishes ) is fantastic too !, 
  my list is quite long , an artefact of my travels and the great food culture we have in my city with restaurants from nearly every corner of the world represented . . 
  anyway , in no particular order , here goes :, 
  - thai ( pad thai , massaman curry , penang curry ), 
  - indian ( omg , where to start ? 
  i like it all , but especially saag , lamb chops from the tandoor , seafood moilee , onion bhaji ), 
  - croatian/balkan ( [ peka ] ( https://triciaannemitchell.com/2013/04/03/croatia-peka-culinary-trogir-roasting-meat-restaurant-recipe-food-travel/ ) cooked meat and vegetables , [ beef pa\u0161ticada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c5%a1ticada ) , seafood from the grill , boiled potato and spinach/mangold , cevapi ), 
  - french ( give me a beef tartare any day of the week and you will make me happy af , steak frites , croque monsieur , bisque ), 
  - mexican ( soft tacos , chicken mole , etc , etc ), 
  - persian ( fesenjan - a walnut and pomegranate sauce based stew - is lovely , kabobs , persian rice ), 
  - german ( pork knuckle , schnitzel , bratwurst , rosti ), 
  - levantine ( hummus , olives , kebabs , all that lamb and rice , flatbread , falafel ), 
  this is by no means an exhaustive list , but rather reflects what i most often cook myself or choose to eat out - there are so many other great dishes and cuisines out there i have n't mentioned at all !, 
  the soya chicken is good !, 
  when i buy lunch from the bbq joint near the office i sometimes get that as part of the mix , as they will let you choose two meats as part of the lunch meat , rice and pak choy they do . 
  i quite often buy char siu pork to take home and make stir fry with - it 's a quick and convenient way of making a meal at home , and that deals with the dryness you talk about . 
  ( though tbh i find the place i like best does n't have that problem much , though i totally get where you 're coming from . . ), 
  the duck is also good too . 
  [ another view ] ( https://i.sli.mg/hh8fsu.jpg ) of this remarkable and little known usaf spaceplane . 
   the boeing x-37 , also known as the orbital test vehicle ( otv ) , is a reusable unmanned spacecraft . 
  it is boosted into space by a launch vehicle , then re-enters earth 's atmosphere and lands as a spaceplane . 
  the x-37 is operated by the united states air force for orbital spaceflight missions intended to demonstrate reusable space technologies . 
  it is a 120 % - scaled derivative of the earlier boeing x-40 . 
   the x-37 began as a nasa project in 1999 , before being transferred to the u.s. department of defense in 2004 . 
  it conducted its first flight as a drop test on 7 april 2006 , at edwards air force base , california . 
  the spaceplane 's first orbital mission , usa-212 , was launched on 22 april 2010 using an atlas v rocket . 
  its successful return to earth on 3 december 2010 was the first test of the vehicle 's heat shield and hypersonic aerodynamic handling . 
  a second x-37 was launched on 5 march 2011 , with the mission designation usa-226 ; it returned to earth on 16 june 2012 . 
  a third x-37 mission , usa-240 , launched on 11 december 2012 and landed at vandenberg afb on 17 october 2014 . 
  the fourth x-37 mission , usa-261 , launched on 20 may 2015 and is in progress . 
   operation crimp ( 8 -- 14 january 1966 ) , also known as the battle of the ho bo woods , was a joint us-australian military operation during the vietnam war , which took place 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north of cu chi in binh duong province , south vietnam . 
  the operation targeted a key viet cong headquarters that was believed to be concealed underground , and involved two brigades under the command of the us 1st infantry division , including the 1st battalion , royal australian regiment ( 1 rar ) which was attached to the us 173rd airborne brigade . 
  heavy fighting resulted in significant casualties on both sides , but the combined american and australian force was able to uncover an extensive tunnel network covering more than 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) . 
   the operation was the largest allied military action mounted during the war in south vietnam to that point , and the first fought at division level . 
  despite some success , the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war . 
  the tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on saigon during the 1968 tet offensive before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from american b-52 bombers in 1970 , ending their utility .
