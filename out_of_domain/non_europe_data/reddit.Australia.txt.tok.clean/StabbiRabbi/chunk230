  that 's not the only thing . . 
  is n't that an f-4g ? 
  look at where the cannon is mounted in an f-4e , that bulb at the end is part of the g 's ew suite , not the squarer tip of a cannon i think . 
  also , the unit ; 37th tfw was the wild weasel wing ( hence the ` ww ' tailcodes ) until it handed that role onto the 35th tfw . . 
  wikipedia is great , but that 's the problem with it . 
  it 's caught me out before too . . 
  still a great picture !, 
  he did spend time at a seminary , which in hindsight seems * almost * as unlikely . . 
   before 1914 , the austro-hungarians who ruled sarajevo in bosnia and herzegovina wanted land in the sarajevo old town district to build a city hall and library . 
  [ 27 ] the land had a home on it and , despite offering the owner money , he refused and continued to refuse even when told that he had to move . 
  [ 27 ] when the officials threatened him , he moved the house and rebuilt it , piece by piece , on the other side of the miljacka river , as a way of spiting the officials . 
  [ 27 ] the sarajevo spite house operates today as a restaurant called inat ku\u0107a ( which means `` spite house '' ), 
  i ate at that restaurant a couple of months ago , and recommended it to anyone who finds themselves in sarajevo . 
  edit : also posted below in another comment , but [ here 's ] ( https://i.sli.mg/5pbwjj.jpg ) a [ few ] ( https://i.sli.mg/6ay2om.jpg ) quick [ pictures ] ( https://i.sli.mg/uurpu4.jpg ) i [ took while there ] ( https://i.sli.mg/yxg7qc.jpg ) . . 
  it 's a shame you did n't man - great food , * very * good value , a beautiful spot right with a little terrace down by the river at the souk end straight over from the freshly restored town hall/former library and then , of course , the story of the house itself ( with an interesting collection of old weapons on display inside . . ) !, 
  i mean , * everywhere * had great food at very fair prices , but the spite house was very enjoyable indeed for all those other elements . 
  there 's always next time !, 
  sarajevo is somewhere i definitely want to return to . .

  i thought it was great - food , ambience , location , value . . 
  sarajevo is good generally like that , but i really enjoyed the spite house particularly . 
  i see it as a natural progression . 
  film used to be * the * american art form , and thus they elected reagan . 
  now it 's reality tv and ergo trump gets in . . 
  ooooh , you smaaaart boy !, 
  china happier still . . 
  edit : why the downvotes guys ? 
  i was only referring to israel 's well known habit of selling top secret us military tech to china , with specific reference to the unavoidable conclusion that at least one idf f-35 will indubitably be handed over for inspection at least , as per the f-16 ( via `` lavi '' ) , patriot missile and etc and etc. . 
  so nothing to be offended about !, 
  honestly , i shudder to think . . 
  fucking hindoo nationalists crack me up . . 
  such inferiority boners !, 
  such comedic racism !, 
  such ridiculous historical revisionism !!, 
  ftr poop wallahs , without the raj there would be no india , and yes you do fucking owe us for your railways . 
  you guys should *** beg *** us to come back , honestly you really should . . 
  now , before replying in anger u/aryartaakhandbharat , u/keedaaghori , u/lundlele please try to master pooing in the loo before attempting any refutation , so i can at least read your response without tears of laughter at your hubris blurring my vision !, 
  hindoos are such dirty , primitive creatures who literally worship a beastly religion ( where your fucking fucked up , lousy gods are literally beastly . . ) ; how you have dominance over the sikhs , jains , buddhists , parsees , maoists , muslim and christian denizens of the dark subcontinent baffles me , as they are all significantly cleaner and more evolved !, 
   one of the most prolific and successful combat aircraft in history , the mcdonnell-douglas f-4 phantom ii , flew its final airshow demonstration for the u.s. air force at the november 12-13 aviation nation airshow at nellis afb outside las vegas , nevada . 
  the show was attended by an estimated 300,000 people according to nellis afb public affairs . 
  [ source article ] ( https://tacairnet.com/2016/11/27/phantom-pharewell/ ) , with a great summary of the spook 's *** 58 years *** of us military service and some more phabulous photos of the phabulous phantom 's pharewell . 
  the bestest ally *** ever *** , agreed . . 
  did you know that israel is , in fact , doing the us a * massive * favour by accepting the billions it does n't * really * even want , but only takes to be polite to their friend , america ? 
  that money ( well , * most * of it . . ) goes straight back in the pockets of us defence companies , so it 's basically a stimulus package for us military industry - not a war-dole for bludgers !!, 
  if israel did n't so graciously accept it then the us would n't be able to stop israel from * building planes * to sell to china themselves ( instead of just sharing the us planes ' secrets ) ; the so called `` aid '' is in actual fact part of a nefarious plot to keep israeli industry down and unable to compete with the us arms manufacturers . 
  i say give them *** more *** billions , *** more *** tech to share with china , *** more *** precision guided munitions to take out *** more *** palestinians schools , hospitals and bomb-shelters !,

  edit : removed veteran 's today link due to issues with the source i was alerted to by u/the _ raucous_one, 
   do i have to pay extra for the patronising tone ? 
  sorry , i was * trying * to be helpful . . 
   in general , if one is going to make claims it is their responsibility to provide sources ; not the reader 's to `` google '' it . 
  get over yourself mate . 
  actually , when such `` claims '' are so widely reported , i feel it 's somewhat anal of people who disagree to demand `` source '' . 
  it seems indicative of an attitude not conducive to discussion , but rather obstructionism . 
  this is not university , nor am i a journalist ( or any kind of professional ) and there are accordingly no standards to which i ( or anyone else for that matter ) must be held . . 
  reddit is an open discussion forum , people share their thought , views , opinions and knowledge and all have validity . 
  when something is a widely publicised as israel 's betrayals of us trust wrt to technology transferred for profit to china then i think the onus is actually on you to provide sources that * disprove * it . . 
   you have to admit that there is a lot of grey area in this . 
  israel has a large indigenous defence industry , and has a just as much a right to export technologies it has developed as the us does . 
  actually , i admit nothing of the sort . 
  fms ( foreign military sales ) agreements are * very * tightly controlled , and the us retains the right in all such contracts to review and if necessary block transfers to states they consider unacceptable . 
  clearly selling top secret , very advanced military technology to china is not only contrary to us interests , but also to those of all allied nations in the asia-pacific region . 
  israel certainly does have a very advanced and impressive indigenous military technology industry , but it is so tightly bound with its us partners - from which israel as a nation currently directly benefits to the tune of usd $ 3.8 b per annum - that any and all such technology can not be untangled from the us technology upon which it was originally based , or the us funding which aided its development . 
  this is particularly true wrt to aviation and missile related systems , the two to which i specifically referred . 
   us investigations have never found us components in articles sold to china , as per your sources . 
  ... and that despite the access china gives us inspectors , and israel 's transparency on the matter !, 
  ( / s - i do n't * normally * add the / s , but i do n't want any confusion . . ), 
  the fact that israel was publicly rebuked by the us , israeli officials lost their jobs and even israeli press is reporting it suggests there is a * very strong * basis of fact to these reports . 
  if american agencies release american tech that is america 's business and up to the agencies concerned to investigate and if necessary pursue legal action over ; however , the very notion of a ( nominal at least ) ally taking advantage of the trust placed in them reeks of betrayal and should raise serious concerns about future technology sharing . . 
  especially as israel has demanded special treatment wrt the f-35 's avionics and logistics no other nation ( even partner nations , which israel is not ) have asked for . 
  let me ask you a question : if you have a friend who has made a pass at your girlfriend twice already , despite being warned off and then subsequently rebuked for doing so ( ie they are entirely cognisant of what they have done wrong ) would you give them another opportunity by paying for them to get your girlfriend drunk alone with each other ? 
  while obviously not an exact analogy , the principle of `` fool me once , blame on you , fool me twice blame on me '' is actually very similar in both circumstances , no ? 
  the ship , as in its place within usmc amphibious doctrine ? 
  there is a bit of [ discussion at the moment around evolving the gator navy battlegroup doctrine to include four amphibs instead of the current three , to allow more aviation assets to be deployed ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/2016/11/a-bridgehead-too-far-csbas-aggressive-risky-strategy-for-marines/ ) :, 
   that larger air contingent , in turn , requires a larger arg . 
  clark and sloman suggest adding a fourth ship , a small-deck l ( x ) r , to help carry helicopters so the big-deck lha/lhd can focus on jet fighters , which only it can handle . 
  they prefer lhas without welldecks to devote maximum space to aviation , and in the long term , they 'd like to replace the lha with a light aircraft carrier ( cvl ) able to handle conventional take-off and landing aircraft like the e-2d hawkeye scout and the ea-18 growler jammer . 
  all told , their plan would add nine l ( x ) rs to the navy 's shipbuilding plan and replace four planned lhas with more expensive cvls , at a total estimated cost of $ 21 billion over 30 years .
