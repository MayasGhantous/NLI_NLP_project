  personally i * always * find integration interesting , particularly when communicating across such boundaries as . net -  java and , especially if you regularly need to integrate java and . net it 's a useful library to have on hand . . 
  i do quite a lot of integration work at my work and really enjoy it ; it presents challenges sufficient that i get real satisfaction from effective integration once implemented . 
  i do n't actually know that myself , but someone here can no doubt answer ( i have read enough posts from superbug air/ground crews to know those guys are around . . ) ; however , if i may hazard a guess i would say antennae . . 
  i love my w\u00fcsthofs , and agree the handles fit just right in one 's hand . 
  great knives !, 
  exactly ; it 's a fascinating spacecraft and i for one would * love * to know exactly what it gets up to on those 500 day odyssey missions it undertakes !!, 
  ( is 500 days right ? 
  that was an iirc number tbh , but it definitely stays up for very long periods , well over a year . . ), 
  whatever it does exactly i am sure its capabilities are every bit as unique and powerful as we can conceive of , perhaps even more so !, 
  i wonder if it could even hack foreign satellites , similarly to the subs that used to creep into the ussr 's main eastern naval bases and tap the `` secure '' comms lines ? 
  i bet this little beauty with its enigmatic ways shits the russians and chinese literally to tears , lol !, 
  interesting , very fast compared to the http protocols , though a little trickier for integrations between different ecosystems such as . net -  java of course . . 
  so can it swap between different transports , using something along the lines of a strategy pattern , depending on needs ? 
  if so , does it have hooks to allow extensibility ? 
  i guess , i never go past a couple of pages mainly because meh , but also because it does feel a bit voyeuristic . 
  when people have pm 'd me and we have started an extended conversation i certainly do n't pry like that either , though that is also partly wanting to get to enjoy people 's stories without having already read them as comments . 
  ( as well as laziness . . ), 
  yeah , that 's awesome , is n't it ? 
  re : what its mission is , it could well be capable of performing both roles too , of course . . 
  no worries , this sounds like a fun project - and useful too , 
  well , it is an otv and i think it 's axiomatic that a huge part of its job is proving tech and * developing * missions , and even doctrine ; it 's going to be fucking fascinating seeing what comes next . . 
  i 'm sure the next system that exploits everything the x-37b has demonstrated/developed/discovered in terms of persistent space missions is already well along its development path ; similar to the really high-end stealth drones such as the acknowledged rq-170 & rq-180 , plus whatever other systems are flying they * have n't * even acknowledged yet . . 
  yeah i did n't know about veterans today , or i would n't have included it . . 
  sorry about the `` here 's google '' thing too ; that was unnecessary . 
  the us/israel relationship is * extremely * complex , and multi-layered between different actors from each side , in different roles . 
  ( eg state dept issues rebukes re : settlements even as dod cooperates with weapons supply and development very closely . . ) . 
  the us undoubtedly benefits from working with israeli tech - not only does israel possess some very smart guys , working on some very cool systems , but israel actually uses all this stuff as a matter of necessity ( eg iron dome ) and in doing so must provide huge amounts of operational test data , which is invaluable stuff when developing systems . . 
  israeli tech * is * very good - my country 's army , navy and air force ( australia - so the australian army , royal australian navy and the royal australian air force ) all employ israeli systems , including the iai heron uav , elbit elta ecm pods and litening targeting pods i think i mentioned earlier , and i have seen plenty of pics of usaf aircraft carrying those pods too . . 
  as we have already discussed , these incidents are not necessarily systemic either , and the officials responsible were punished fwiw . 
  i am sure those higher-ups who were involved ( or even actually responsible ) got the message from the us when the public rebuke was issued too , sufficient to make anyone seriously consider before facilitating another such breach !, 
  i believe the previous breaches also occurred in somewhat tangled circumstances , when the israeli political/defence establishment was frustrated with the us - which is * certainly * *** not *** an excuse or mitigating factor , but does at least provide a context to help prevent future spats . 
  then there is the support in washington for israel from all sorts of members of the government . . 
  idk man , it 's certainly much more nuanced than the way i initially discussed it ( a result of the context of where i wrote it - ie r/worldnews , where subtle/nuanced or ( especially ! ), 
  balanced comments are not only hated by both sides and downvoted to oblivion without even provoking discussion , but are also never , ever responded to in kind as everyone is so antagonistic . . 
  the point is that it has happened with at least two really very serious incidents and that that * is * a cause for justified , albeit considered , concern still stands though - the chinese may have stolen f-35 data of some kind , even got samples of radar-absorbing material from the obl crashed stealth blackhawk and subsequently successfully built an aircraft with the same shape as the f-35 , but the aircraft is almost certainly not the real deal : ie a very sophisticated , highly integrated suite of sensors that provides incredible data collection and fusion as well as data sharing capabilities within a stealthy airframe !, 
  accordingly , the chinese gaining access to a real f-35 would be disastrous , and as such a dangerous risk must be seriously assessed . 
  does that mean israel is `` guilty '' ? 
  no , of course not ; however , i think talking about this stuff is important . . 
  f-35 * lookalike * , almost certainly not the same data collection and fusion capabilities though , even * if * the stealth design is adequate . 
  ( as of course with stealth design is the devil is in the detail there too . . ), 
  i live in perth , where things are not as bad , but sydney 's prices are n't * entirely * artificial - sydney is now a huge , global level city and such cities - eg nyc , london , hk - are all expensive . 
  i agree entirely home ownership should n't be for the few , and *** needs *** to be more attainable - what i dislike is the sense i get of some people rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of the bubble bursting and not gaf that as well as investors people who have put their all into buying a family home will be placed in an invidious financial position where they are locked into owning a home they perhaps can not afford to keep , but very can not afford to sell . 
  i am actually pretty secure personally - i have a relatively small mortgage on a very nice apartment in a great suburb that suits my lifestyle to a tee , as well as a solid career ( i count myself fortunate and am grateful to be in such a reasonable position , i do n't take it for granted either ) . 
  i will be able to ride out any fall in value , even if it does disappoint for a while . 
  however , i think of friends , family and colleagues ( both here and in sydney ) who bought homes within the past two-four years ( because they needed to to accomodate a family , or who worked and saved and did n't feel waiting for a burst that may never happen ) who could well be placed in such an awful position . 
  thinking of them and reading comments where people are gloating about others losing value and how they ( the bloaters ) plan to benefit and it just makes me think `` wankers '' , and that is really what i was challenging . 
  i get the impression people think i am annoyed investors/speculators might lose out and/or i value their wealth more than aspiring home owners opportunity , but that really was n't what i was trying to convey as it 's not how i think . 
  btw i am not saying * you * have gloated or expressed glee . 
  you seem entirely reasonable ( which is why i have replied to * you * out of all the replies i got . . ) . 
  sydney is very bad , certainly , and people deserve greater opportunity to enter the housing market as home owners without a doubt ; i just did n't like the tone of some people 's ( not you ) comments which sound very gloaty and it was actually that i was questioning . 
  if you read what i have written i think that 's clear , but maybe not ? 
  it 's not even my own position i am worried about - i ( as mentioned elsewhere ) have quite a small mortgage , certainly one that does n't put me under financial stress and means i wo n't be trapped even if my place did lose a big chunk off what i paid and i am in a very nice part of perth , which is not nearly as exposed as sydney , but i have friends , family and colleagues ( both here and over there ) - who are owner occupiers and who bought since the massive increases because that was when they needed a place for their growing family , or because that was when they became able to and they did n't want to wait for a `` correction '' that may never happen - about whom i am much less sanguine should things really collapse . 
  thinking about them and reading people baying for home owners blood ( yes , i know - that is a very melodramatic way of phrasing things . . ) just left a nasty taste in my mouth and it was that i was trying to question . . 
  thanks for the advice , i 'll bear your wisdom in mind . . 
  i agree entirely with everything you just wrote , it was a well thought out comment and i appreciate you taking the effort to write it . 
  i do get the frustration from those on the other side , i went through it myself until i acquired the wherewithal to buy myself and i have a decent job , which as you say is n't enough in and of itself for most these days , even in perth , let alone sydney . 
  i also agree about some people who do own being fatuous and smug about it , and of course utterly lacking in empathy ( too close too the american `` bootstraps '' mentality for my liking ) - people such as the mercedes guy are awful , and i have no time for such wankers whatsoever . 
  i also think them a symptom of a greater social ill too , but i will return to that anon . 
  before i carry on agreeing , one thing i think you have wrong is london prices ( my family has been in australia since the very early 19th century , but i was born in the uk and lived there till i was 13 - my sister moved back and i still have good friends there , so i am reasonably au fait with london prices which led to me checking ) , googling `` london average house price '' returns the following :, 
   search for house prices . 
  last year most property sales in london involved flats which sold for on average # 501,279 . 
  terraced properties sold for an average price of # 637,823 , while semi-detached properties fetched # 628,504 . 
  even with the present parlours state of the ukp that is still a way above the prices you mentioned , and above sydney . . 
  anyway , i did n't mean to nitpick , but yeah . . 
  one thing you have n't mentioned directly , but i think you will also agree on is the consumerism so rampant in today 's society , which imo contributes to the divisiveness and resentment you describe . 
  not as in the stupid shibboleths of `` if people did n't buy iphones they could buy a house '' sense ( which is just a riff on the patronising smashed avo idiocy ) , but in the sense of it has created too many on the spectrum of your merc guy , while others aspire to that kind of consumption ( which the merc guys of the world rub in their faces with vulgar displays of conspicuous consumption , eg the cars ) and feel further resentment because they can not achieve . 
  or they take on ridiculous levels of debt to fund a bs lifestyle centred on things , which then damages normal human empathy . 
  the debt levels are terrible out there , looking at the numbers . 
  when you consider that not everyone has debts ( i do n't ever not pay each month 's credit card in full , and only use it in the first place due to the offset account with my loan - and i know many others like that too ) , many of those who do must be up to their eyeballs . 
  again i reckon this contributes to the lack of empathy we 've discussed as people become more self-absorbed . . 
  i also get what you say about this particular comment thread being a bit of a draw for the types whose expressed opinions i was questioning . 
  before that ? 
  average since first game ? 
  i am a uk citizen because up was born there ; however , both my parents are aussies and we live in australia , so i am australian . 
  yeah , what about the time before that ? 
  and the average since the first match ? 
  just wins/losses will do mate . . 
  do n't forget the role played by pro-israeli lobbyists , who have been working to normalise human rights abuses for , oh , about 69 years now . . 
  yes , but it was trump 's election that emboldened israeli regime mouthpiece , naftali bennett , to spill his guts about what he * really * thinks , which has lead to this very encouraging statement from the obama administration . 
  furthermore - assuming they have the moral fortitude to back these words with action - obama and the team still have a couple of months to fuck israel 's shit up ( wrt to the illegal colonial project in palestine and the regime 's * appalling * attitude towards human rights , at least as apply to non-israelis ) !, 
  long enough to rescind us unsc vetoes on any motion calling for israel to be punished for its criminality . . 
  is that a steering wheel , as used by a ship 's master ? 
  would n't that make her . . 
  film sets ? 
  nah , this might have been shot by kubrick , but there are film industries all over the world . . 
  sydney is $ 65k , yet housing there is significantly more expensive than perth though . . 
  i prefer median household income as a better measure for comparison of one 's own salary against in order to establish one 's own relative importance in , value to and moral significance within society . 
  for example , my household income * significantly * exceeds both my state and the national median household income , which is great ; however , at the moment my household income is lower than my suburb 's median , which gives me something to work on . 
  this works for me because i am a single individual , living alone and , as a result , when my household exceeds the average household 's then i am * very * clearly a better person , in a better position in life , than those fuckers who have share less between two , or even more , people . 
  why are people who ask `` difficult '' questions so completely unable to formulate properly structured english sentences ? 
  well , i bought my first batch in the single digits , and while i was no doubt still but a callow youth who failed to properly appreciate it then , i still buy a'bunadh to this day and enjoy it greatly . 
  sorry , but i ca n't help myself : i just look down on seppos and their appalling language skills so very greatly . 
  hard to tell with a throwaway , so i did n't even check , but the irish are notoriously fucking stupid too . 
  want to hear some irish jokes ? 
  i know * heaps * . . 
  q : how many potatoes does it take to kill an irishman ? 
  a : none, 
  i think that 's about as savage an indictment of the irish intellect as one may find , i mean what kind of idiots ( `` eedjits '' in your native patois if you do n't know that word as i wrote it ) plant only a single crop , vulnerable to rotting , when they live in a god-forsaken bog ? 
  what 's with the tough guy shtick too mate ? 
  we 're on the internet here , nobody 's tough .
