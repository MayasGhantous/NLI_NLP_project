  conversations are so much better than two people getting shouty imo !, 
  i agree entirely with all of the above ; it 's a well-thought out argument and covers a lot of the relevant points . 
  i talked about this a little bit elsewhere itt , but , to expand a on what i have already said a bit , think the missing piece in the jigsaw is a tad harder to pin down , as it is somewhat existential/metaphysical is nature and relates to our cultural perceptions of what being a productive member of society means , in purely psychological terms ( as you covered many of the practicalities nicely ) . 
  just as men have had to adjust our perception of what `` being a man means '' as society has become more equitable , so people are going to have to shift their focus on identity ( both self-identity * and * perceptions of others identities ) away from one 's job ( which many people use as the basis for identity ) as the nature of what exactly constitutes a job evolves . . 
  i think this has the potential to unlock many of the positives you have id 'd ; however , it * does * require some serious consideration , followed by education and will ( even following both of those activities ) indubitably involve some pain-points along the way . 
  it 's the future though , so like it or not we better get ready for it !, 
  may i ask what the bottle cost ? 
  i live alone , and have a ( kind of ) high paying job , but i do n't get lonely tbh . 
  for a start my colleagues are all a decent bunch , and i enjoy our social interactions at work . 
  secondly i live walking distance from my parents , with whom i have a great relationship and i see them 2-3 per week . 
  ( eg dinner at mine , dinner at theirs , meet at local caf\u00e9 , etc. . ), 
  i also have enough friends that i have another couple of evenings/weekend days taken up hanging out with them , doing a variety of activities together . 
  i also have a number of friends who live overseas or are `` internet friends '' ( from shared hobbies , and even random pms sent on reddit ) i text with fairly frequently ( like every day for some to every week for others ) . 
  also , and probably most importantly , i am comfortable in my own skin and quite happy being alone ; in fact , if i do n't get enough `` me time '' i grow increasingly antisocial and grouchy . 
  i enjoy reading a lot and have other hobbies too , i do n't mind watching tv/movies/videos / whatever either and stuff like cooking occupies my time too . 
  wow , that seems like excellent value - tbh i was expecting at least 10x that !, 
  where might one purchase a bottle of this do you know ? 
  ( i live in australia , but can obviously order internationally ! ), 
  your review makes it sound very much like something i 'd enjoy , and i would love to get in on this if i possibly can !, 
  thanks . 
  i 'll do some googling and see what i can find . . 
  the stars are on the wrong side . 
  this is not the same thing * whatsoever * !, 
  made from different milks ( eg cows , ewes , goats . . ) , using different techniques , aged for different periods of time among other things as mentioned in other comments . 
  the skyknight is a pretty cool albeit not well known jet ; saw combat over korea as a night fighter , then in vietnam as a ew platform and of course launched the first sparrows as seen here . 
  i think it 's hilarious how jewish people have all these rules they wo n't actually break , but * will * go to incredible lengths to subvert and avoid the inconvenience of , in the most ingenious of ways . 
  i just imagine them saying `` what g-d , i * did n't * do any work , did i ? 
  that oven just turned itself on . 
  literally , that 's what it did . . '', 
  their thousand yard stares . . 
  that 's israelis , not jews . . 
  hey , got to stop those peace talks from kicking off somehow . . 
  i have to watch some albanian action movies if this is what they get up to in real life . . 
  that 's kind of neat . . 
  i have long advocated targeted sanctions against israeli regime members and settlers/settlements , in a similar fashion to the way russia 's polity is personally sanctioned . 
  this would give the regime pause for thought while heading off any suffering for those israelis not directly involved in the ongoing criminal colonialist project in the wb . 
  thanks for the detailed explanation , i really find this kind of direct and detailed response one of the most rewarding things about reddit . 
  obviously my op was somewhat tongue in cheek and did n't reflect my previous understanding entirely accurately , but i did find the fact about the star both fun and interesting ; also i think your last point is a good one for people to bear in mind . . 
   depends how you look at it ... will bringing embassies into west jerusalem strengthen everyone 's rights and freedoms or will it *** further marginalise palestinians and give legitimacy to internationally recognised criminality *** ? 
  unfortunately , the \\* clause i have highlighted is exactly what this act will do . 
  such a move plays right into the hands of the hardline religio-nationalist extremist regime which currently rules not just israel , but , tragically , the palestinian people too . 
  * any * move that not merely condones , but actually actively supports , the egregiously illegal flouting of international law and treaties to further the anachronistic colonialism that characterises israel 's behaviour in the occupied and illegally `` settled '' palestinian territories should be condemned on legal as well as moral grounds . 
  this is the equivalent of giving a mass murderer a nice long stay in a luxury resort instead of a prison upon sentencing for their crimes . 
  it is a disgusting move by trump and further entrenches the usa 's complicity in israel 's ongoing crimes in the wb . 
  a sad , sad day for humanity . 
  \\* edit : i fixed the typo , which is what i 'm guessing was the source of these downvotes . . 
  i mean , what type of person could possibly disagree when i say laws and morals are good things , right ? 
  trump knows tech , has all the best tech , etc. . 
  yeah , i reckon i could do that too . 
  i just do n't want to , you know ? 
  americans . 
  they do n't count as human , right ? 
  you 'd have thought they 'd be * happy * , now satan is in the white house ( soon to be repainted as the black and gold house i believe ) , but blah blah blah . . 
  same guy , just a few comments down :, 
   i never implied reddit did n't operate internationally . 
  but it is an american company . 
  it 's built by americans for americans . 
  it 's subject to all us laws and regulations . 
  if it did n't exist we 'd just make another one . 
  foreigners are nothing but an afterthought . 
  and there it is . . 
  if only he 'd mentioned pizza , i think we 'd have bingo !, 
  crushed up cornflakes also make a good , crunchy , batter mix in lieu of breadcrumbs . . 
  i ca n't offer you any practical advice , just my sympathy/empathy . 
  having narrowly escaped life in a wheelchair myself i can understand some of your emotions , although my circumstances were never quite so bleak . 
  this was in great part because i was already established in my professional career , which by virtue of its nature i was able to continue uninterrupted even while undergoing the physio that eventually got me back on my feet ; as such i was never subject to the vicissitudes of centrelink to survive . 
  i hope this gets sorted out ; to me cases like yours empitomise why we have a `` safety net '' , and it both saddens and angers me that in its current state that safety net has failed you so awfully . 
  hit f5 and it will start in debug mode , that should make it run . . 
  ~ ~ conflict ? ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ nah , those two do n't fight * each other * . . ~ ~, 
  which will all be hamas 's fault as dastardly terrorists , nothing to do with these people `` just building houses '' , of course . . 
  not jews , israelis . . 
  and because they are flouting international law and treaties they signed . 
  * everyone * ( who 's not in aipac 's pocket or some kind of religious nut job ) is angry at these particular israelis . 
  because they are criminals . 
  mine too now . 
  israel attacking isis ? 
  i am very interested in the region and its current affairs , but obviously missed that story - could you provide a link please ? 
  omg !!, 
  this is * exactly * what i said supporters of the criminals behind this egregiously provocative flouting of international law and treaty would say , check it out : https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5pvqrw/germany_slams_israel_over_latest_settlement/dcu7l01/, 
  uhh , any , you know , * non-israeli * sources though ? 
  i try to avoid propaganda personally . 
  in any case , `` isis-affiliated '' could mean anything , it 's not actually isis , is it ? 
  no conspiracy theories , just observation of the facts ( real facts , not `` alt-facts '' , on the ground . . ) anyway . 
   all of the gunmen were suspected militants from *** `` shuhada al-yarmouk , '' an isis offshoot *** which controls the area . 
  [ emphasis my own ], 
  well , the consensus seems to lean towards al-nusrah ( whom idf medics regularly treat when their fighters are wounded ) , though al-nusrah is no longer their name , * not being * aq : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jabhat_fateh_al-sham#speculations_on_a_split_with_al-qaeda, 
  those * inaccuracies * ( alt-facts ? ), 
  aside , what does `` isis offshoot '' even mean ? 
  why not just attack , you know , isis ? 
  that 's one interpretation of a complex situation - it 's not as black and white as you 're trying to paint it . 
  just because someone says they 're fans of , say , manchester united , it does n't make them members of the team when they kick a ball around . 
  why not just go after isis ? 
  anyway , i 'm done : enjoy the last word . . 
  do n't try to patronise me . 
  i suspect your understanding of what constitutes irony differs from my own , which is , i believe , the generally accepted view of the word 's meaning . 
  a better example of real irony is that that the israelis are oppressing palestinians in many of the same ways that their ancestors who subsequently illegally colonised palestine were oppressed by the nazis . . 
  not all germans were , let alone are , nazis and not all jews are israelis . 
  conflating the situations as you have is , imo , a misreading of the situation . 
  baby otter 's what ?
