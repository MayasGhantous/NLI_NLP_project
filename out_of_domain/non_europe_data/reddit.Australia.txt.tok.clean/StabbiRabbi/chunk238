  good advice , but what do you do when her hobbies are unutterably tedious ? 
  how do you show genuine interest in that situation ? 
  this is horrific , but something that people who are interested in the conflict and informed regarding the current , extreme right-wing religio-nationalist/cryptofascist israeli regime 's illegal colonisation project in occupied palestine are already largely cognisant of . 
  the story regarding the idf 's chief rabbi and his horrendous attitudes towards rape was , after all , quite well publicised despite the regime 's propaganda machine 's best efforts to stamp out the story and his subsequent , laughable , efforts to deny/retract his statement . 
  for those who may be new to observing and discussing the regime 's ongoing crimes , those who may have forgotten the rabbi and his pernicious influence on the idf stormtroopers he leads , or those pro-israeli regime apologists who would deny that the idf , at the very least , condones the rape of palestinians here are some references :, 
  [ haaretz : israeli military chief stands by choice of top rabbi who implied rape is permitted in wartime ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.730678 ),

  there are plenty more , but i chose israeli sources whose reportage on israeli matters can not be written off as antisemitism , as is the apologists ' wont . 
  israel is a very primitivistic nation ; that connexion between then and now is considerably stronger there than it is in modern , western , post-enlightenment nations . . 
  i 'm actually a zionist mate - i 100 % support israel 's right to exist in peace and security , enjoying self-determination as a country where the jewish nation may be at home . 
  i simply i disagree with the brutal and illegal colonisation of occupied palestine ( including jerusalem ) and , as an impartial outside observer , am not blinded to the horrific nature of the present regime 's egregious human rights abuses or other war crimes . . 
  i am certainly not an antisemite . 
  sorry if that does n't suit the apologist mantra that all criticism of israeli actions and regime policy is antisemitic , but i actually think jewish people ( all the ones i have known personally at least , including my former business partner and his family ) are cool af . 
  that 's actually why the horrors currently being inflicted upon the palestinian people sadden me so very much tbh . 
  i like jews and respect the culture ; the regime does not seem to fairly represent the jews i know though and too many people do conflate jews and israel in a manner that is harmful to the interests of innocent jews not involved in the colonisation project , both within israel and around the world . 
  gtg , off to r/israel to watch the gloating turn into screams of `` trump is an antisemite '' . . 
  edit : so nobody on r/israel is claiming antisemitism ? 
  how about this ? 
   [ well breibart is a bastion of anti-antisemitism . 
  seeing how bannon is the ceo of breibart and also america 's shadow president . 
  this move is 0/10 surprising . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/israel/comments/5rptjc/trump_warns_israel_stop_announcing_new_settlements/dd9a590/ ), 
  sounds *** a lot *** like an accusation of antisemitism in the trump administration to me . 
  here 's a hint , would be propagandistas : when you make claims , at least * try * to shoot for lies which take more than a few seconds to disprove . 
  smh . 
  you ca n't read the bottom comment because the mods have removed it , but someone who at the very least purported to be israeli made a comment saying exactly that before i said anything about it . . 
  so you are wrong in this instance , and the notion that people complain about being called antisemite more than they are accused of of it is not borne out by my own experience/observation . 
  might i suggest that there is an element of confirmation bias present in your not noticing such accusations as they do n't affect you ? 
  no worries , thx for replying at all . . 
  are they rocaf ( taiwanese ) roundels on the voodoo ? 
  if you can dig it out i 'd be really interested . . 
  rocaf reconnaissance is an interesting topic , particularly with these cold war types , as many wore rocaf roundels ( or civilian markings of `` airlines '' air america and cat ) while being operated by cia pilots - as that is an rf-101b i think it quite likely that if it * is * in taiwanese/rocaf/nationalist chinese colours that is quite probably its background . 
  i think that cold war history is fascinating , and yet it 's still relatively little-known . 
  cool , thanks man . 
  please msg me with the link when you do so i do n't miss it !, 
  israel can . . 
  * do n't you know * *** anything *** ? 
  actually , the idf , or rather its leaders , * are * often significantly more moderate than the foaming-at-the-mouth civilian regime leadership . . 
  of course , elor azaria - the butcher of hebron , who recently scandalously skated on the murder of an unconscious palestinian by only being convicted for manslaughter due to a technicality - is idf as well , but the leaders - of mossad too - do often display a far greater degree of sanity than the cryptofascist , religio-nationalist , extreme right-wing regime . 
  always 1/32 too , for whatever reason . . 
  cold weather hats - the ones with flaps - i think . . 
  incredible how much effort was expended in this base 's construction - only for the serbs to destroy it for no reason other than spite , given the realities of croatia 's air force 's limitations and bosnia & herzegovina 's lack of an air force when the destruction took place . 
  i visited croatia and bih both last year and the year before , and am booked to return this year ; however , as much as i would love to visit this facility the thought of all those landmines means i wo n't even consider it any further than as a passing fancy . 
  which is a shame as i am certain i would find it absolutely fascinating . 
  he `` bloody hundredth '' as they were known due to the horrific losses they suffered . 
  to this day the groups aircraft ( now kc-135r tankers ) are authorised to wear their wwii group makings ( the `` d '' within a black square , clearly visible in this photo ) in honour of their sacrifices ; afaik , they are the only group currently allowed this privilege . . 
  i wish catholics were still banned here , as they were during the early colonial-era \\* . 
  this is one regard in which our society has definitely gone backwards , rather than progressed , since we were a prison-continent for convicts . . 
  edit : spelling ( identified with \\* ), 
  i really did not understand what you meant , until i noticed i had written `` ear '' instead of `` era '' - how i laughed when i realised my mistake . . 
  that was a genuine typo though , not an attempt to be `` edgy '' , and i have now fixed it . 
  happy cakeday btw !, 
  still be just as loud though - they use the same engine and it 's the engine that generates the noise levels produced by the f-35 . . 
  it posed no threat to the serbs , given the lack of air forces on the part of both croatia and bih ; however , as the article mentions , it could have provided bihac with the airport they are still planning despite the serbs ' wanton destruction . 
  so yes , spite is the appropriate word imho - as is often the case when analysing the actions of the serbs in the period between losing the fight and withdrawing from the areas they were attempting to absorb into their insane idea of a `` greater serbia '' at the time . . 
  israel 's regime and the colonialist settlers simply have to be stopped . 
  sanctions now , targeting the regime leaders and settlers . 
  edit : rephrased so as not to tar israelis * not * involved in this wickedness with the same brush as those who are . . 
  this is true . 
  i should have explained myself better - i favour sanctions that target the settlers and the regime , not general sanctions against innocent israelis not involved in the colonialist project in palestine . 
  i will edit my op to reflect your point . 
  well , at least he did n't blame `` urbans '' ( at least not specifically ) . . 
  seems mighty optimistic , even for an anarchist given which states are under discussion . . 
   those are urbans , not mooslems . 
  sorry , but `` googles '' is now the preferred , culturally-insensitive terms in alt-right circles . . 
   ~ ~ the ~ ~ student *** s *** ~ ~ who came out with this ~ ~ need ~ ~ s ~ ~ a fucking reality check hard . 
  as a former uni student myself , ftfy . 
  given her username includes `` camgirl '' i think she can probably tell by extrapolating from her income . . 
  i do n't see why this is contentious - why ca n't * all * nuclear programmes be under such safeguards ? 
  the fact that india is presently ruled by a right-wing , religio-nationalist fundamentalist extremist regime simply means that the need for such safeguards is especially pressing in this case . . 
  lake matheson is a lovely spot , though when i was there it was raining . 
  still just as beautiful , just different though !, 
  the [ cafe at the start of the walk there ] ( http://www.lakematheson.com/cafe/ ) is * excellent * too , a standout in a country that is full of great places to eat . 
  ( while staying at fox , we went there twice - for dinner , then breakfast the next morning ! ), 
  yeah , why do n't they just let the foreign colonists take everything and just shut up already ? 
  jeez , do n't they know their complaints are getting boring . . 
  it really is time that swingeing sanctions are imposed on the israeli regime leadership and settlers/settlements , to force them to reconsider the value proposition of their greed and hubris . 
  just as members of putin 's regime are targeted individually , so should be netanyahu , bennett , shaked , libermann and the rest of the thugs that form the current regime . 
  similarly , the settlements with their populations of viciously racist , almost entirely recently immigrated foreign colonialists should also be sanctioned to the point those colonialists can not lead normal lives in any sense of the word : after all , it is exactly that level of oppression their theft of palestinian territory has imposed upon the indigenous palestinian people . 
  clearly the israeli government will never bow to the demands of sanity without such measures . . 
  ugh , how is it you are * still * allowed to propagate this hate speech against * the majority of australians * ( indirectly , by constantly slandering the government said aussies voted in . . ) ? 
  i * hate * trance , it 's utter shite . 
  try wrapping your ears around some pure/minimal techno mate , you might get some brain cells back . . 
  i thoroughly enjoyed it , rain notwithstanding !, 
  it was more drizzle than monsoonal , and added to the ambience of the photos i took . 
  i would definitely love to do it again , whether it 's raining or not . 
  such a beautiful , peaceful place . 
  sorry if i sounded a bit harsh - everyone of course has every right to like what they like , and you come across like a good dude . 
  enjoy your trance !, 
  it 's good to listen to lots of genres , and decide what you like based on how it sounds rather than what it is ( as i do myself - there are trance tunes i like , tho my taste generally favours more minimal styles . . ), 
  when did i criticise the opposition ? 
  i have n't said jack about that ratbag shorten . . 
  ha ha , my memories date back to around the same era ; however , i recall trance moving from more techno type acid trance ( like sven vath ) to the type of progressive style played by the guys you mention , which was the opposite direction to the way my tastes were evolving . . 
  it is all about the memories , definitely , and the feelings those tunes still evoke to this day !, 
  mate , *** you *** do *** not *** criticise *** my *** logic , ok ? 
  just remember that and be cool , then we do n't have to have any problem . 
  jews * had * lived in the region in large numbers a couple of millennia ago , yes - this is simple historical fact . 
  and some jews have always lived in the region since ; however , the majority of the jewish community took decisions that led to their dispersal and abrogation of any meaningful moral - let alone legal - connexion with the land . 
  meanwhile , the palestinians ' ancestors * also * cohabited with the jews , until the jews took those decisions that led to their abrogation of their connexion with palestine and the palestinians ' ancestors stayed there without the ancient jewish communities . 
  this has been proven not only by the historical record , but also genetic studies that clearly demonstrate that the palestinians are descended from the region 's ancient populations .
