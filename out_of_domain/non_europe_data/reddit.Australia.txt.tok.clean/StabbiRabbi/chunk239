  as are the jews ; it 's just the jews made their choices and left for *** two millennia *** , only deciding to return in numbers seventy years ago . . 
  i already told the other bloke mate : people like you do not get to criticise people like me . 
  do yourself a favour and live your life by that principle . 
  honestly , things will get better for you as soon as you accept this simple reality . 
  in any case , you are objectively wrong . 
  my logic is neither `` biased '' nor `` flawed '' . 
  well , there was a little thing called the holocaust : google it . 
  however , there is no moral justification for simply handballing on the suffering onto another people , is there ? 
  or do two wrongs somehow make a right ? 
  optimism is a positive trait , though perhaps in his case na\u00efvet\u00e9 is more apt ? 
  your hubris will simply make your life more difficult mate ; it does n't hurt me . . 
  the zionist lie that the palestinians are not indigenous has been disproven genetically , as well as by the historical record . 
  when the jews took the decisions that led to their abrogating their rights to palestine during the pax romana era do you think the land was just depopulated ? 
  of course not , other people - not so hubristic as to challenge the pax romana - stayed , and their descendants are the palestinians . 
  they may be culturally arab ; however , ethnically they are closest to the jews who decided dodging tax meant more than peace and paid the price than anyone else . 
  numerous genetic studies have borne this out . 
  how the hell do you think that helps justify israeli colonialism by recent immigrant jews ? 
  you 're being sarcastic , but everything you say is true . . 
  this is why i support greater funding for programs to help people with autism . 
  add some dayquil and sprite and that 's medicine of our people !, 
  well , the casts were n't left directly - they were made by pouring plaster into the space left by the decomposed bodies . . 
  these casts really send a shiver up your spine when you see them ; it immediately humanises an event from two thousand years ago , and makes it very easy to imagine how awful it must have been for the people whose forms we now see as plaster . 
  pompeii is amazing place , tragic and beautiful at once . 
  it 's good advice man , and well expressed . 
  i do n't feel particularly shitty right now , but i 've my share of worries and concerns buzzing around my head ( like everyone else ) ; you just helped remind me i only need to stick to my guns , that the things currently bothering me * will * pass . 
   we can all save ourselves a lot of misery by not trying to force the world to bend to our mold of it . 
  doing your part , forgetting bullshit you ca n't control ... 
  this is particularly solid advice imo , the world is what it is . 
  does n't mean one should n't strive for improvement , but accepting that the world is never going to suit me - or any of us for that matter - absolutely perfectly really helped me put aside a great deal of anxiety and stress . . 
  cheers for sharing your thoughts mate , you have helped me refocus again today , and clear some of the noise from between my ears . 
  much appreciated . 
  the darker grey was actually worn on some vulcans while in service iirc , so while it 's not correct for xm667 as preserved it is not absolutely wrong either . . 
  india : truly the dark subcontinent . . 
  mr & mrs smith, 
  great shot - wanaka is such a beautiful place . 
  i had the great pleasure of flying over the lake , then landing on it , as a passenger in a wwii catalina amphibian ( plane ) during last year 's `` warbirds over wanaka '' airshow ( held very other easter ) - it was an amazing experience and gave me a very different view of the town/lake than i had previously enjoyed during my other visits . 
  if anyone else reading ever has that opportunity i would advise them to take it , it is definitely something special !, 
  ( especially if you are have an interest in aviation . . ), 
  yeah , those bastards !, 
  advocating peace and stuff - terrible , just terrible . 
  no wonder israel is so angry . . 
  ha ha , projecting much ? 
  now that the usa seems to be falling in love with fascism all over again they probably just want everyone else to join in the fun . . 
  this is great , and deserves to be read by all who are interested in the region . 
  to me , it clearly illustrates the point many israelis are genuinely decent people and the country is more than settlements and right-wing nutters . 
  whenever people from either side reach out to help the other - a not entirely uncommon event , particularly at the individual level - it renews my hope that eventually the region 's woes may pass and both israelis and their neighbours coexist in mutual peace and prosperity . 
  dude , i have a great deal of regard for israel in many respects ; most respects in fact except for the settlements and ongoing conflict , for which the israeli government must be held at least equally responsible as the other parties involved , no matter how one one cuts the pie . 
  my issue is with the present regime , and the settlers - *** not *** normal , every day , decent israelis , be they jew or arab . 
  i have professional contact with israelis regularly , people for whom i have the utmost respect , and liking . 
  i also count myself a zionist , given i wholeheartedly support israel 's right to continued self-determination as a place where the jewish people/nation may have a home , living in peace and enjoying prosperity . 
  when i see something positive about israel i am more than happy to praise . 
  indeed , i genuinely wish i had more chances to issue praise as well as criticism ( and do understand the relative scarcity of such chances compared to the burden of criticism has a great deal to do with how news from the region is reported - not because israelis are n't often nice ! ) . 
  i know that my criticisms can be harsh , but they are never driven by a hatred of israel or the israeli people ( let alone jews . . ) , but rather my profound disappointment at the actions of a fairly small section of israeli society . 
  da tovarisch , you are make the good point for sure !, 
  perth ? 
  my ex-gf , with whom i am still good friends , is currently training to become an ambo ( ambulance paramedic ) and i must admit the thought of what she will indubitably have to face as part of her job worries me quite a bit . 
  she is resilient , and i am sure our ambulance service provides support , but i am still concerned for her . 
  i hope she is ok , and admire the decision she took to embark on this career though - the same to you mate . 
  i wish the ran still had proper carriers , able to launch fixed wing aircraft , as we did then . . 
  these late model spitfires are simply stunning aircraft . 
  had the pleasure of getting up close to a [ mk 22 ] ( http://www.raafawa.org.au/museum/supermarine-spitfire#!spitfire_1_174 ) last week at my local raaf museum . 
  they let me explore inside their lancaster too , which was fantastic !, 
  * the brady bunch * captures late - '60s american life pretty accurately . . 
  especially not the thinnest-skinned man in the world , el presidente trump !, 
  * foyle 's * is excellent . 
  another really good uk period drama that dovetails with the latest , post-war , series of * foyle 's war * is * [ the hour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_hour_ ( bbc_tv_series \\ ) ) * , which captures '50s britain in exquisite detail . 
  * sharpe * is another good series in line with those mentioned by u/thinkb4wespeak too imo . 
  good guess , but nope : it actually goes back much further , and refers to the [ sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ) . 
  when i created the account - long before the `` stabbing intifada '' btw - i intended it as a comment on the cyclical nature of violence ; the sicarii are widely recognised as the first `` terrorists '' in history ( in the sense that we understand the term ) , yet now their methods are being meted out to their descendants . . 
  not something to celebrate , but interesting nonetheless imo . 
  i know it 's not entirely accurate to refer to them as `` rabbis '' , given rabbinical judaism actually evolved from the zealots ' enemies ; however , it 's just a reddit username , not a doctoral thesis , and was always meant a kind of visual rhyme ( it does n't rhyme if you speak it - pronunciation is stabb-ee-rabb-eye ) / play on words . . 
  jpost : http://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/2-hurt-in-beersheba-stabbing-criminal-motive-suspected-481296#article=6126ntdbrjywnjq0odvgmdi1mujgmufgrjjbqkixrdq2qzg=, 
  personally i would n't call the stabbing of israeli civilians `` justice '' ( poetic or otherwise ) ; i just find it ironic . . 
  i must say though i am perhaps somewhat more ambivalent about how members of the right-wing ( extremists at least , particularly the `` alt-right '' with their `` alternative facts '' and vicious bigotry ) are treated , given how they openly call for the treatment of others . 
  yep , same etymology . 
  it is a great movie . 
  pont l'eveque , manchego , pa\u0161ki sir , bouche d'affinois , pecorino, 
  what do you think might happen next between them ( trump/netanyahu personally ) ? 
  surely they have to meet at some point ? 
  obviously asking for a definitive answer is unreasonable , as things seem to chop and change so fast with so many different factors/influences affecting these changes , so i 'm just asking for your opinion . . 
  that is mesmerising . . 
  could watch those puppies spin all day . 
  compared to american food ? 
  i guess the lack of hfcs and things like drinks being served in cups as opposed to buckets is a bit distressing to those not used to it , but i can assure you i personally - as someone from a 3rd nation with excellent quality food - would rather eat in the uk than the usa 10/10 . . 
  do n't eat from chain restaurants , ever . 
  so no , not that . 
  though it is certainly reasonable to hold mcdonald 's up as an icon of typical american `` cuisine '' . 
  let 's see - i have been all the way down the east coast , from pennsylvania to florida on one trip ; the other trip was az to ca via tx , nv , nm , co. 
  though perhaps you 're right and 10/10 prefer to eat in the uk is a tad unfair - make it 8/10 . . 
  do n't live in europe either . 
  your seppo stereotyping is powerless against me , sorry . 
  the company i work for was recently bought out by a large us based multinational . 
  i literally just sat down at my desk again following a safety meeting in which we were told the corporate safety office in the states ( two members of which visited here about a month ago ) have decreed we have to wear safety glasses when using the toilets , as the toilets are located next to the warehouse/workshop area . . 
  safety glasses to go to the toilet . 
  i shit you not . 
  in certain subs simply my username causes conniptions , no matter what i write . 
  i did n't anticipate all the hate tbh , but whatever - now i just roll with it . . 
  that 's the gulf of tonkin incident ship , is n't it ? 
  ( well , one of them to be exact . . ), 
  oooh , that 's not good .
