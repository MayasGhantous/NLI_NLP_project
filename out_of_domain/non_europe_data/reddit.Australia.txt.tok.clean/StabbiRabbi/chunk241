  happy to hear it mate , good stuff !, 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  sweet, 
  it seems time * is * a flat circle . . 
  this whole story is tragic and utterly dreadful - what a fucking cunt . . 
   `` to this day , my biggest regret was not hugging [ my father ] and telling him i loved him , to say thank you for being an amazingly loving and caring parent , '' ms lin said . 
  this is something we should all remember imo , hopefully nobody reading *** ever *** has to go through anything like this , but we should still always be mindful of how much the people we love really do mean , and be grateful they are in our lives . . 
  bamfs to a man . . 
  yeah , op did n't even claim '' *** my *** sundae looked like . . '' , this is fine . 
  the short-term nature of leases is a big issue , as it is definitely being exploited by landlords/rental agents . . 
  that list of `` top 10 issues '' was pretty grim ; i would * hate * to have to put up with * any * of those issues , let alone be silenced by my concern that a complaint would lead to my having to move house . 
  the bit about how wa has most disputes about cleanliness rings very true - when i used to rent i would * always * get professional cleaners in on leaving to avoid hassles , yet despite that ( and not being a messy cunt anyway ) had agents try to keep portions of the bond for cleaning on numerous occasions . 
  in europe people often secure much longer-term leases : if renting is where you are at in the housing market you should at least have that option imo . 
  moving sucks , and costs an arm and a leg . 
  not gloating in the least ( please do n't misinterpret this . . ) , but i am so grateful i was in a position to take on a mortgage after reading that . 
  mcdonald 's ice cream * is people * !, 
  that 's exactly how i used to see it play out , though luckily i never had it bad enough to have to go to a tribunal . 
  agents would expect you to not only hand back the keys with the place in a reasonable condition , but for it to be significantly better than when you picked them up - then they try to bully you into giving up part of your bond by holding the rest hostage . 
  people like that rely on others not having the wherewithal - be that in terms of time , money or simply knowledge - to stand up to them ; like any bully they tend to fold if confronted . 
  i have to admit i have negotiated down amounts rather than taken it to the level you did for the sake of convenience , but i 'm not proud of it - i *** should *** have refused to hand over a cent , given the circumstances . 
  however , the amounts they would reduce to made it more economical for me to let them keep a bit , but get to get on with my life instead of getting bogged down in some interminable dispute process . 
  the other thing they hold over your head in wa is that your name is put on a reiwa ( real estate institute of wa ) blacklist , and good luck getting a rental after that . 
  it 's fucked . 
  that 's bullshit mate , yet you have recourse to be compensated for * that * . . 
  good on you for standing up to them , especially under the circumstances . 
   this is of course assuming you deserve the bond back . 
  this is an important point - you obviously need to have done the righty . 
  however , it 's fucked that the system is so skewed in their favour that you have to have done everything right to just get what 's yours , whilst still being vulnerable to having it taken from you . 
  wow , that 's just fucked . 
  i never had a situation * that * bad , at least everywhere i rented was structurally sound and safe . 
  sounds like that landlord was taking the absolute piss . 
  hey !, 
  that 's anti-semitic !, 
  ( btw i 'm not jewish mate . . ), 
   what 's wrong with connecting with him ? 
  you mean * apart * from the hurt you are most likely going to cause him , and potentially your wife ? 
  you know , the stuff you 're bitching about having to deal with in this post ? 
  i 'm not the original guy who criticised you fyi . 
  it just seemed a bit funny to me you asking `` what 's the problem '' after starting a thread about how you have inadvertently created this problematic situation . . 
  anyway , i hope you work things out with the minimum of hurt all round . 
  sorry i ca n't offer any more constructive advice , but tbh i do n't know what the best way forward is for you from here ( other than to say honesty is generally a good starting point ) . 
  good luck mate . 
  i bought and live in an apartment , and am more than happy to do so . 
  it 's a nice apartment , in a great location within a brand new , high quality building . 
  the whole building is fttp nbn . 
  the insulation is excellent ( which helps both with noise - i quite literally only * ever * hear my neighbours if we 're * both * on our balconies at that point in time - and temperature control ) , including double-glazing . 
  the building has a superb energy rating , and my power bills are much smaller than many people i know . 
  it 's nicely fitted out , with a good quality , very functional kitchen . 
  my room has an en suite , and there is another bathroom with a laundry area built in . 
  i use the second bedroom as an office/hobby room . 
  i have storage right next to my front-door . 
  it has a nice balcony with a great view . 
  i live literally 200m from the train station and only 300m from the shops/restaurants/etc , with a gym and cafe straight across the road . 
  there is a park around a lake , municipal pools , a 9-hole public golf-course and tennis club across the road also . 
  the city is 10-15 mins ( depending if i catch an express train or a stopping train ) in one direction ; the beach is two stops in the opposite direction . 
  living in apartments can be great , and is the norm in most cities globally . 
  the whole block in the ` burbs thing is so australian , and really needs to be reevaluated imo . 
  to me it 's not second-best , or something i have had to lower my aspirations to accept . 
  i love living there , and would n't dream of giving it up to move to a mcmansion in the outer ` burbs . 
  it suits my lifestyle , but also my ideological beliefs that we do need to embrace urban infill and medium/high-density living , especially along the train lines , to help solve the sprawl issues all aussie cities suffer from . 
  that 's pretty impressive . . 
  the coffee can be up to $ 50 per week , and at some point i 'm going to have to have a week or two of not cooking more bulk meals for lunches ( when my freezer is full . . ) so that will be cheaper . . 
  i do n't waste any food or anything though , as that pisses me off . 
  i am still building up all the spices and stuff i use , so that adds a bit each week . 
  edit : also eating out is expensive in perth , especially compared to sydney/melbourne so the meals i * do * eat out are disproportionately expensive . . 
  if i was n't in work i would definitely adjust my spending . . 
  $ 4-5 a day is pretty tough man , at least it sounds like you spend on healthy food/nutrition and not junk . 
  glad to hear i 'm in the right ballpark as someone similar !, 
  sounds much like where a lot of where my grocery dollars go - certainly fresh produce and high quality protein is much more expensive than carbs . . 
  i do eat some bread , pasta and etc , but certainly not every meal , preferring vegetables ( cooked or raw as salads ) instead . 
  that stuff adds up . 
  definitely want to enjoy what you eat , and of course buying quality costs a bit more . 
  seafood is n't cheap , for example , but i love it so i go and buy it . 
  always fresh , and always worth it . 
  i 'm a bit of a foodie too , and cook nice meals that are always based on nice ingredients . 
  i get that it 's perhaps a bit indulgent , but it 's how i choose to spend my cash , and i think it 's worth every cents . 
  i do n't waste anything , i do n't buy junk - it 's healthy and it makes me feel good . 
  plus i can always entertain at home easily if i choose , so it delivers value in other regards too . 
  that 's pretty good management skills . 
  i guess you do get some economies of scale , but it still obviously takes discipline . 
  for some dust . . 
  that was the kind of crap i was used to too . 
  good on you for taking it to the tribunal . 
  seriously , screw those guys . 
  ah , by mineral water i mean fizzy mineral water . 
  should 've made that clear . 
  i just like the bubbles ( i know , i 'm a kid , right ? 
  ) , but also buying 1.5 l bottles is a very convenient way of ensuring i drink as much water in a day as i like to . 
  i could go sodastream , i guess , but i have ethical issues with supporting that particular company . 
  sounds fairly similar to me , though i must admit i am an inveterate carnivore and do have animal protein nearly every meal , except breakfast . . 
  i thank you for the link , as daily i thank shakira that her breasts are small and humble . 
  so that i do n't mistake them for mountains . 
  edit : spelling . . 
  yeah , i agree they need to accept the reality on the ground : israel is here to stay . 
  however , israeli actions - eg settlement expansion in particular , but also the numerous hassles and humiliations visited upon the palestinian people - do n't help matters either . 
  neither side can claim either the moral high ground wrt or that the other is entirely to blame for the current situation . . 
  i thought you probably would - i have read enough of your views ( over the years now ) to know you to be a pretty reasonable guy . . 
  it 's why i replied in large part tbh . 
  nothing bad about houses or apartments per se - apartment living suits my lifestyle now , but that may change . . 
  as far as my ideological preference for apartments goes , that 's actually for medium/high-density housing along the train lines ( to paraphrase myself above ) and i agree people should be able to live where suits them - from inner city apartments to semi-rural acreage - within a functional city .
