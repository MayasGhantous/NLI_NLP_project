  this is n't worldnews , it 's australia where our pesky post-enlightenment morality interferes with our ability to unconditionally support israel 's war crimes in the occupied and illegally colonised palestinian territories or excuse away the horrifying nature of that occupation . 
  that 's not to say people here hate israel , but those aussies i know who take an interest in world affairs do not agree with our politician 's ( bribed . . ) laxity towards israel 's * actions * in the wb & gaza . 
  if anything it seems to me that there is a degree of brigading from users who are not regulars on this sub , but rather focus entirely on propagating israeli apologia . 
  sorry if that bursts your little bubble of indignation , but it is what it is mate . 
  australian jewish people are , in my experience , generally perfectly decent , normal aussies ; israel as a nation has many good qualities and much to admire ; however , the current israeli regime is a viciously nationalistic mob of demagogues and thugs . 
  should australia have good relations with israel ? 
  certainly . 
  if israel allows us to by behaving as a responsible member of the international community and not the mad dogs of the me the present regime seems set on becoming . 
  free the oppressed palestinians by giving them israeli citizenship or a palestinian state and then australia should certainly draw close to israel , but until then our pesky morals make that very difficult . . 
  thanks trump !, 
  yeah , i am not going defend hamas - i have zero interest in doing so for a start , and clearly they are indefensible . 
  however , not all gazans are hamas members , or even necessarily supporters ; exactly how not all israelis support bennett and the jewish home ~ ~ gang ~ ~ party , or even likud for that matter !, 
  yep , godzilla is actually a metaphorical origin story of the japanese nation , dontchakno ? 
  in terms of people not starving and the country not suffering a complete breakdown of the rule of law , yes - i think even that would be better . 
  of course something in the middle would be better still - maybe a president who understands economics , but is n't a us puppet ? 
  nonetheless what * has * happened is pretty terrible . 
  be great to see how these match up against advanced f-16s . . 
   if you hate children , you hate your childhood self, 
  mind = blown . 
  not really , what a load of crap . 
  i do n't * hate * kids , but certainly they are irritating af , i try to avoid places where their minders are encouraged to bring them . 
  nothing worse than being in a restaurant and having some kid screaming , or running amok . 
  there are kid friendly venues and i avoid * them * - the least the kids ' parents could do is show people without kids the same respect . 
  and please do n't get me started about what they are like on long-haul flights . . 
  you 're going to get downvoted by the r/australia circlejerk , but i hear you mate . . 
    these decisions always hurt the people that work the hardest . 
  this is patently bullshit - as you say , people who work ten hours a week making coffee are simply not the the hardest working people in our society , not by a long shot . 
  i work in software development , so i am an office worker too , but i do n't consider myself among the oppressed masses in any sense , despite occasional crazy weeks . 
  i know i am not one of the hardest working people in our society , but equally i know i work harder than the bulk of people affected by these changes ( despite their self-obsessed views to the contrary ) . 
  personally , i suspect * that * honour ( hardest working . . ) goes to , oh idk , er doctors & nurses , or the guys that break their balls working 12hr days on minesites ( though they do get paid well in total , their hourly rate is often dismal ) , or farmers , or maybe school teachers . 
  listen to this crap though ( quote from article , the guy who is a gym manager with the smug smirk ) :, 
   i have worked in hospitality before and the whole reason you put up with difficult customers is because you get paid incentives to work on weekends, 
  what happened to putting up with the parts of your job you do n't enjoy because , you know , it 's part of your job ? 
  there are part of my job that suck too , but you know what ? 
  i suck it up and crack on . 
   generally speaking their pays reflect the work they do, 
  exactly . 
  i do n't see how this refutes * anything * i said tbh mate . 
  junior er docs do n't actually get paid massively ftr , but that 's by-the-by . 
  the fifo workers get paid heaps , but they work long , long hours - literally 12hrs a day , 6 days a week for weeks on end . 
  people * always * get paid according to how much value their work holds ; if the penalty rates no longer reflect normal working hours or value provided and are an impediment to small-business giving staff hours - or even opening on long weekends - then i would argue they do need to be reviewed . 
  if businesses ca n't afford staff then these guys do n't have * any * job , which is certainly worse for our society and , i would argue , surely worse for the individuals involved too ? 
   everyone has a right to be pissed at taking a pay cut ( unless you were say the ex-ceo of fucking australia post ) , especially when it impacts so many people . 
  of course people have a right to be pissed off at changes that negatively impact them , but them being pissed off does n't necessarily mean they are seeing past the tip of their own nose . 
  lucky i do n't really care what randoms on the internet think then , is n't it , or maybe i would feel as outraged someone dares hold an opinion different to my own as you evidently are . 
  why should i have to put up with it though ? 
  i have zero obligation to anyone else and their kids , beyond treating people decently as i always do anyway . 
  having kids was the parents ' choice - if they ca n't get the kids to stfu then why should * we * , the unencumbered , suffer and sacrifice for * their * choices ? 
  it 's only a few years before most kids get past the point of being a public nuisance , till then i 'm sorry , but the parents should avoid inflicting their brats on the general public . 
  i * can * handle it , but you are yet to explain why i am obliged to ? 
  if there are kids being little shits i tend to get up and leave whenever it 's an option . 
  this then harms the businesses who lost my custom ( and , as a single i have a fair disposable income to buy food and drink , more so than many parents i know . . ) ; yet according to the world view you are promoting these businesses are somehow obliged to wear that too , so these parents can go out when they feel like it ? 
  i do n't hate kids - i even like some kids ( friends ' & family members ' offspring ) - what i do n't like whatsoever is selfish , narcissistic parents who think society owes them something for popping out a kid . 
  kids being little shits is * not * *** my *** problem . 
  all i ask is it 's not forced onto me , not made into my problem due to the parents ' sense of entitlement . 
  as far as immaturity goes , do you not think your refusal to accept that not everyone wants to put up with noisy kids , tantrums and etc while trying to enjoy a meal ( or an international flight , or whatever ) is , in and of itself , perhaps a tad immature ( too ) ? 
  how am *** i *** taking * anything * out on * anyone * ? 
  i did n't make these decisions , and i wo n't be implementing them . 
  i am all for a fair day 's work for a fair day 's pay ; my * only * issue is with the self-obsessed sense of entitlement that seems to be crippling our society 's ability to do anything , as everyone starts thinking their own personal circumstances are the only relevant facets to these really incredibly complex issues . 
  i wo n't be getting a raise this year because here in wa the economy is sluggish . 
  do i want a raise ? 
  sure , of course i do - life 's essentials are n't getting any cheaper . 
  will i have a cry about not getting one though ? 
  nope , coz i recognise the business environment is what is preventing it . 
  *** not *** that *** i *** am somehow being picked on . 
  i can accept that the whole world is not organised for my personal convenience though , something some of these people seem singularly incapable of doing . 
  i guess that 's why i can see past my back pocket , and am not whinging about how tough my life is . 
  look , i do n't want people to be paid less and certainly am not rubbing my ** hands ** and thinking `` excellent '' , but it is what it is . 
  the commission did its work , and these were the findings . 
  edit : forgot a in the ** emboldened ** spot above, 
  labour regulations are incredibly important , for everyone . 
  however , times do change . 
  i do n't think big businesses are as greatly affected due to ebas in which the unions have often already signed away workers ' rights - as per labor 's muppet mouthpiece from coles talking about this . 
  i do know many small businesses can not open on long weekends/public holidays due to penalty rates making it uneconomical - i honestly do n't see how their employers going broke helps employees though , beyond one month 's paycheck . 
  idk mate , it 's a complex issue and i do n't have an ideological position wrt it . 
  i just get sick of all the kneejerk , circlejerk ( manufactured ? ), 
  outrage whenever anything changes in this sub . . 
  that was really my point , not that these workers deserve less or anything . 
  woah - bizarro world argument !, 
  * sweet * dude . 
  you are , like , a totes insightful genius or whatevs !, 
  i reckon you must be like , a uni student , for sure . . 
  you know nothing about me or my circumstances , do you mate ? 
  past or present . 
  i have been a student , and tbh would love to have that lifestyle back - crappy demeaning jobs and all . 
  it was really the most fun time of life i have ever had . 
  i 'm going to let you in on a little secret mate ( if you 're a uni student - or maybe tafe for you actually ? 
  - sit down , this will be a shock ) : life actually gets * harder * when you become a full-on grownup and assume the responsibilities of a real life ; you should make the most of your student years , because you will never have the same freedom and scope for socialising and self-indulgence again . 
  seriously , stop moaning and go have some fun . . 
  oh , and when have i ever said `` fuck these guys , they do n't deserve to be paid '' ? 
  all i expressed is that i get frustrated by the endless circlejerk , which you currently epitomise . 
  i know i should have simply ignored you and moved on , but you really do need a fucking reality check . 
  and , tbh , i am * really * looking forward to your reply to this , which i am positive will literally have me in stitches !, 
  anyway , look , fuck it , let 's put penalty rates *** up *** . 
  will you be happy then ? 
  i mean , when the businesses lay off staff and then eventually close these workers can go on the dole , and wo n't that be fun for them !, 
  then you can jerk off about that too . 
  ( `` the government sucks !, 
  fuck the man !, 
  in this day and age it 's literally evil how hard it is to buy 60 '' oled lcds and xbones on the dole '' , or whatever your usual hobbyhorse is mate . . ),
