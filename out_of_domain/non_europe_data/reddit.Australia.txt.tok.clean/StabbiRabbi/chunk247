  it 's important to recognise when they do the right thing even if it does n't excuse the wrongs . 
  i 'm quick enough to criticise , believe me . 
  i agree ; israel could be so much more . 
  the whole situation is horrific , sadness comes along hand-in-hand with that horror . 
  i guess it struck me as significant due to how much of a turnaround it is from the israeli-right 's triumphalist gloating when trump was first voted in . 
  you should know i do n't shy away from criticism of the israeli government . 
  any step in the right direction is better than another displaced family , or kid shot dead for protesting . 
  this does n't change the situation much in and of itself , but is considerably better than retroactive legalisation of illegal settlements !, 
  but , but israeli law is the bestest law , right ? 
  is n't there some opinion that says the treaties israel signed ( gc pt iv ) do n't count coz they do n't want them too wrt to palestine . 
  or something ? 
  this is a lot better than the recent retroactive legalisation of illegal settlements though . 
  that was some bad shit , i 'm glad they are showing some restraint - even if it is a token effort !, 
  unfortunately the extreme right has a massive stranglehold on israeli politics , and their power has been unchecked for some time . 
  i honestly think only international pressure will effect the change necessary . 
  sanctions , against settlements , settlers and politicians is the only solution that will bring results imo . 
  you should watch that louis theroux documentary * [ ultra zionists ] ( https://vimeo.com/102569427 ) * , that explains quite a lot of how they operate . . 
  eu sanctions would be a great start as the eu provides a market for many israeli goods and services . 
  sincerely hope so . 
  this itself feels like a reaction to the israeli right 's previous , awful , gloating that trump was going to give them free rein wrt to settlement expansion - their shock when he actually reined bibi in was palpable , and a massive relief to me . 
  i 'm not saying trump is necessarily going to do the righty , but otoh , he has n't fulfilled the hopes of bennett et al , at least not yet , either . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's just parroting the debunked zionist propaganda tract * from time immemorial * , which finkelstein proved used fraudulent figures anyway . . 
  exactly . . 
  as someone else just pointed out , if one is to criticise their criminal actions , one must also acknowledge when they do the right thing or lose any moral authority and be easily ignored by the apologists : `` it does n't matter what israel does , you only ever criticise '' is an argument that may not have much real meaning , but is emotionally reasonant . 
  plus , you know , fair 's fair . 
  just as israeli apologia relies on whataboutism , so it is whataboutism to say this is n't good because the israeli government is simultaneously doing bad shit elsewhere . 
  i share your outrage , but baby steps are better than nothing , particularly in the current israeli political climate . 
  yes . 
  the person who attacks is the one who starts the fight . 
  it really is that simple . 
  '67 was *** not *** a defensive war ; it was a planned war of territorial aggression . 
  moshe dayan was quite open on this fact . . 
  can only live in hope . 
  eventually the whole rotten business will come to an end ; the more egregious their crimes , the worse that ending will be . 
  sanctions are necessary imo ; in the meantime , just have to take each event as it occurs . 
  israel was also flying `` air defence tests '' over foreign sovereign territory and engaging in clandestine `` probes '' . 
  the whole '67 war plan was laid out a long time before it kicked off ; furthermore , the conflict immediately prior was * also * israeli aggression ( suez canal ) . 
  it was a war of aggression ; dissemble how you like , those are the self-evident historical facts . 
  israel attacked , without warning or declaration . 
  not too late for you mate , not your fault . 
  start now and you 'll catch up/recover . . 
  i did no such thing ; i did n't even mention these alleged attacks . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth mate . 
  you failed to mention israeli provocations , so i simply filled in the blank spaces you left . 
  anyway , you think what you like . 
  anyone can read the history and the historical record is perfectly clear : israel attacked . 
  israel 's existence was never threatened . 
  this was made perfectly clear to the israeli leadership by both soviet and us leaders who sought to head off the vicious attack that israel initiated . 
  this is irrelevant to the article anyway , nice talking . 
  stabby-rabbi , ie a rabbi that stabs . . 
  a play on words inspired by the world 's first `` terrorist group '' : [ the sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ), 
  it 's not supposed to be read * literally * , it 's an ironic commentary on the cyclical nature of violence , yes , but mainly a ( visual ) rhyme/pun . 
  and yes , i know rabbinical judaism descended not from the zealots , and probably more of the history than you do , already before you try to get into that . 
  it 's a reddit username , not a doctoral thesis . . 
  will do . 
  that 's not entirely within the control of the israeli regime though , as radical settlers do have a habit of going and seizing hilltops ( eg the `` hilltop youths '' , fanatic settlers who are also religious extremists ) . 
  indeed , some settlers are opposed to the regime . . 
  what would be most disappointing would be retroactive legalisations , or even just further existing settlement expansions as these matters are matters of government policy . . 
  great answer !, 
  exactly what i wanted to know , and as i suspected . 
  the ngj will be along soon , which will add a whole new level of capability ; ( artists ' ) illustrations i have seen seem to show growlers only carrying two of those , do you know anything about whether two will be standard ? 
  yeah , with the alq-99s three seems standards ; i was wondering about the soon to enter service next generation jammer as all the artist drawings seem to only show one under each wing , no centreline . 
  i ca n't imagine anything more awful than being stuck on one of those giant cruise ships . 
  how so ? 
  yeah , it 's a massive scam , and the people who organise the `` colleges '' and employment are ripping everyone involved off - the students , and us ( the australian public/taxpayers ) . 
  a lot of it is all contained within different national communities too , so people target their compatriots while milking our system . 
  this allows for it to be under the radar , but i know a lot of indians personally who are quite happy to talk about how it works . 
  it 's real , dumbass, 
  dirty , dirty business . . 
  nz is a lovely place and great for a holiday , but honestly - having looked at job ads while there - you 're quite right . 
  and you wonderwall your relatives do n't like you . . 
  when i was there last ( last easter ) that was a very common subject for news articles , so i had it in mind when looking at ads . 
  since then the housing situation - admittedly particularly in auckland - but also other , different , issues in places like cc in the wake of the earthquakes has made the news quite a bit here in aus ( and on reddit . . ) too . 
  i really , really like nz - beautiful place , nice people , etc - but for me it makes more sense as a holiday destination . . 
  i hope you realise you will *** not *** be able to carry a gun around . 
  in fact , you may never see a gun the whole time you are here . . 
  good to see you still posting this information . 
   you could say it 's one ethnic group ruling over another, 
  you * could * , but it 's scarcely the same thing . 
  for a start the west did n't even try to colonise iraq ( this time around at least ) , let alone illegally transfer it 's population over to iraq . . 
  such obviously disingenuous answers do n't help make your case . 
  sure , but those guns are almost always holstered and not exactly accessible . 
  not like texas . . 
  except when you effectively annex the territory and colonise it . . 
  as israel is aggressively doing , despite being signatory to the gc pt iv which explicitly prohibits such behaviour , in the occupied west bank . 
  i 'm not downvoting you , and i can empathise with your position . 
  there are certainly differences from capital a `` apartheid '' as practiced by south africa ; however , there are also clear parallels too . 
  change my surname back to saxe-coburg and gotha . 
  sounds much more impressive . 
  i consider it a form of apartheid in that two populations , separated by religio-ethnic identity , but living under the control of the same authorities have different sets of laws applied to them . 
  that is to say , a palestinian living right next door to an ( illegal ! ), 
  israeli settler is forced to endure military laws , whereas the ( illegal ) settler enjoys the full benefits and protections of the state ( israel ) which has control over both their lives . 
  this extends yet further , so there are roads settlers may use , but the palestinians may not , within the occupied and illegally settled area . 
  furthermore , for palestinians in the wb there is currently absolutely no pathway to israeli citizenship . 
  ergo , they are both treated differently ( and obviously worse ) and trapped in that position based on their religio-ethnic identity : this is very much apartheid in essence , if not exact detail . 
  while it is not literally south african apartheid as practised in south africa , that is the closest parallel and , imo , the most useful descriptor for the situation . 
  i wo n't downvote you because you * are * contributing to the discussion , even though i do not necessarily agree with your arguments . 
  i can also understand why it must be difficult as a left-leaning israeli to see your home nation being criticised so heavily , especially as * some * of the criticism is motivated by anti-semitic animus , and think it 's great that you are willing to ask questions/express doubts : many israelis will do neither , which is not helpful imo . 
  mindlessly downvoting does nothing to promote discussion , but merely reinforces peoples ' feelings of being disregarded , or even bullied . 
  yeah - i heard 100k about 1yr ago in wa , plus sometimes a cut of the wages !,
