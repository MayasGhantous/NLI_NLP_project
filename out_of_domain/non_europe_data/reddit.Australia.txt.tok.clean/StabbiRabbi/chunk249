  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women's_battalion#1st_russian_women.27s_battalion_of_death ) , emphasis my own . 
  i have read this guy 's story before , it 's like a real life scene from an action movie . 
  literally swung under the bridge with explosives under enemy fire , single-handedly holding up the nva advance . . 
  no worries - i 'm not surprised that did n't stay up long . 
  it was pretty nasty . . 
  tad bit ? 
  is n't that a tad tautologous ? 
  more further down :, 
   last time i checked , the inventors of modern civilization were n't third world savages . 
  also the space is n't ours . 
  but america belongs to americans . 
  libs ? 
  do n't you mean `` aussie pollies '' there mate ? 
  blaming labor was the best bit i thought !, 
  you are the echo chamber dude , embrace it . 
  that 's a beautiful spitfire , they regularly fly it at temora aviaton museum in nsw near canberra , which is where it lives . 
  love the big lez reference . . 
  do n't need to sound so disappointed . 
  that 's a * good * thing right ? 
  fewer casualties ? 
  it was the ignominious israeli withdrawal that leads people to talk of an hezb victory in ' 06 . 
  i bet israel would love to bomb the shit out of that !, 
  i 'm quite good at annoying people . 
  it 's spelled `` carrion '' . 
  and no i have never eaten it . 
  i reckon it looks a bit like new south wales specifically . . 
  domestic violence was recently decriminalised in russia : http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/news-and-views/news-features/russian-parliament-votes-3803-to-decriminalise-domestic-violence-20170128-gu0q86.html, 
  bela !, 
  excellent . . 
  left-footers are * nuts * !, 
  justice for serbs is best served in 9g doses . 
  ah you think perhaps they did not get the israeli-regime-propaganda machine memo about `` nu-speak '' ? 
  as i understand linguistic theory , some languages are just better for obfuscation and dissemblance , which perhaps does n't help wrt to translation too i guess . 
  surely victory should have been the fulfilment of political goals such as limiting hezb 's ability to operate , if not the excisement of hezbollah from lebanon ? 
  in this regard surely you can not say such objectives were achieved , let alone hezbollah left unable to function ? 
  indeed , hezbollah have succeeded in continuously strengthening their defensive position both politically and militarily since : given they were formed to defend the southern lebanese people from the idf 's depredations i consider this to be a victory in and of itself , especially given recent developments wrt hezbollah 's relationship with moscow and their acquisition of advanced missile technology , which in conjunction with the training provided by russia should make israel 's next act of aggression come with an even bigger butcher 's bill than did ' 06 , especially if the lebanese do unite . 
  finally , if you 're facing an enemy who has been brainwashed to view you as being worth less then them , and which has an absolute amorality in terms of how proportionally they respond ( in this regard elements of the idf echo other extreme-nationalist regimes ' elite formations ) , then actually just `` staying alive '' * is * a victory in and of itself . 
  let 's not forget sabra and shatila , or qana . 
  seeing as hezbollah has never sought to invade and conquer israel ( at least not militarily - the occasional propaganda shadows so many israelis quake at the thought of notwithstanding ) yes , avoiding conflict ( ie a surprise , undeclared israeli invasion is a typical issue regionally ) is a success for hezbollah , especially in light of israel 's aggressive posture and constant provocations . 
  do you think it mere coincidence hezbollah only formed during the israeli occupation , with the following manifesto ? 
   hezbollah 's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of `` the americans , the french and their allies definitely from lebanon , putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land '' , submission of the phalangists to `` just power '' and bringing them to justice `` for the crimes they have perpetrated against muslims and christians '' , and permitting `` all the sons of our people '' to choose the form of government they want, 
  \\ [ from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hezbollah ) - note , the phalangists were israel 's literally fascist christian militia ally . ], 
  the idf have been found responsible for sabra and shatila as they facilitated and provided direct support , specifically force security , for the massacres , which were also it would seem idf pre-approved . 
  i notice you avoided discussing [ qana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qana_massacre ) , that other classic `` idf 's greatest hits '' standard . 
  they could still take all but the latest and best , assuming good maintenance and some sensor/avionics improvements - which the f-14s in that splinter camo have had . 
  they are known as f-14ams , with the 'm ' for modernised ( similarly to f-16am / cms ) . 
  do n't know about the fulcrum though . 
  that 's an early one ( without the hump ) , but even they had hobs missiles and helmet-mounted-sights as well as excellent aerodynamic performance even if they lack range iirc . 
  the idf ordered and facilitated sabra and shatila , but you 're right - they are not alone in their guilt . 
  i did mention the phalangists and believe what i said about them quite adequate to express the depth of * their * depravity . 
  however , it 's not the phalangists ( or the palestinians ) whose crimes under under discussion in this instance . 
  we were talking about hezb 's history with the idf , what exactly do the palestinians have to do with that ? 
  nobody is denying their culpability ; however , that is another discussion for another thread . 
  palestinians with blood on their hands wipes not one drop from the isf 's grisly fingers . . 
  it 's true there is a massively ignorant pro-labor circlejerk in this sub ; however , much of it seems to be bitter plebs railing against their betters lead by a hardcore of alp shills rather than informed political contributors . 
  ha ha , not * everyone * on this sub relies on the dole . 
  the very fact he bought his ex a $ 500 gift would argue against his being on centrelink . 
  or is the stuff about the dole being somewhat less than overly generous we read here not quite accurate ? 
  did you look as far back as that purchase to see if the gift had been returned and the purchase removed from your list of transactions ? 
  stasi is spelt with an `` s '' , not a `` z '' . . 
  just saying `` without '' does n't stop you sounding like exactly that . 
  perhaps you meant `` without meaning to '' ? 
  salty r/lewronggeneration millennial is what you 're shooting for , is it ? 
  how is it a grammar issue ? 
  it 's an issue of how you come across , it 's exactly the same thing as if i said `` no offence , but i think you 're a stupid seppo fuck '' to you , or the `` no homo '' thing . . 
  most likely florida , surely ? 
  we call the smaller crocodilians `` freshwater crocs '' , not `` alligators '' here afaik . 
   `` oh i do n't do history . '', 
  and that , kids , is how you get a neo-fascist president . . 
  this is actually very widely known , and there are plenty of references to it . 
  here is the wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poena_cullei, 
  the article provides plenty of primary sources ( linked ) . 
  i do n't suppose it matter much , i think you made your point anyway seeing as i was able to extrapolate your intended meaning . . 
  parliament house has long been surrounded by afp in that kind of get up - i visited canberra a couple of years ago ( on a public holiday long weekend , when parliament was n't even in session ) a couple of years ago and one of the first things i saw on joining the queue to look around was an afp stormtrooper , g36 assault rifle in hand . . 
  this is necessary for the situation to progress past the present impasse israel maintains as the status quo . 
  while the law passed is in and of itself really quite horrifying , such ramifications such as are discussed are potentially very positive for any and all who are in favour of a peaceful resolution . 
  lol . 
  oh no it 's not . . 
  jog on then mate . 
  sounds like my ex-gf . 
  students going to be wankers . . 
  what does that even fucking mean dude ? 
  they were both fucking shite , i 'm glad i 'm not a seppo . 
  ooh , you 've literally * filled in tax returns * ? 
  i like how you phrase that , carefully avoiding whether you have actually paid any tax , lol . 
  anyway , whether you have or not i think you sound very grown up . 
  do you have one about how the chetniks are equally guilty of collaborating too ? 
  i 'd be more interested in that tbh . 
   i just worded it how you worded it, 
  wtf are you talking about , kiddo ? 
   i do n't remember you people 's names , stabby yabbie . 
  * peoples ' names, 
   making the body more sensitive to lower doses of booze : it allows more alcohol to get to the bloodstream faster because it skips most of the stomach and is better absorbed by the intestines, 
  sweet , brb getting gastric bypass surgery . 
  idk who 's downvoting you , but fwiw i 'm not . 
  i respect your right to be wrong , you know ? 
  cheeto benito is a scary freakshow , but makes perfect sense from a cultural perspective : just as when film was the epitome of us culture a movie actor was president , so now that reality tv is the height of us cultural product a reality tv star is entirely apt as current president . 
  clinton was a venal pos and i 'm glad i personally was never faced with having to vote # 1 cheeto to frustrate her ambitions . 
  in most regards democrats in the us are far to the right of the lnp , never mind the gop . 
  americans have a very distorted view of what `` left '' and `` right '' mean compared to nations such as australia or most of europe .
