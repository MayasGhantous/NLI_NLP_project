   it does n't really matter how americans view left and right versus the rest of the world . 
  i agree in the general case ; however , in this case your entire shrill , sanctimonious and hypocritical critique of aussie politics is misinformed by your misunderstanding of these concepts . 
  you also seem to struggle with reading comprehension more so than an inability to understand my hypothetical voting preferences . 
  i did not say i would vote for your current beloved master to `` spite '' $ hillary , but rather to * frustrate her [ evil ] ambitions * . 
  there is a world of difference , and frustrating the entitled aims of a corrupt and wicked politician is hardly petty . 
  so why do n't you jog on back to seppostan ? 
  i agree entirely with your views on the matter , but i 'm not even jewish . 
  it has been quite eye-opening reading some of the pms the username has triggered ( in particular , but comment replies too - even in this sub which kind of dismays me , as i did n't think we had a big problem with anti-semitism here ) - from people who disagree with my views and choose to interpret my username as an expression of my `` jewish heritage '' . 
  otoh , some of the `` meanings '' extreme-right-wing israelis derive from it are freaky too , whenever i dare venture an opinion on the occupation and illegal colonisation of palestine . . 
  so yeah , eye-opening all round . 
  as a straight , white , aussie bloke from a ( mainly ) anglo/coe background i had n't personally experienced much bigotry directed at me before i created this account and i must admit i have been shocked at the venom on occasion . 
  honestly please , does that even make sense to you mate ? 
  it is a complete non-sequitur ; $ hillary has precisely zero impact on trump 's regime . 
  just coz $ hillary was a venal cunt does n't change cheeto benito into a good guy . . 
  is the tail dipped like that due to clearance issues with the hangar door ? 
  yep , and she drinks champagne , but it tastes just like cherry cola , c-o-l-a cola . . 
  the light positioned just so looks like xe has a massive set of cojones ; that 's probably where any confusion originates . . 
  it would be interesting , but which sub would be appropriate ? 
  i do n't really want to court or otherwise encourage either rabid lefties or right-wing nutjobs either , which would be a minefield given the subject matter . 
  for example i 'd be cautious of r/creepypms as i can kind of predict how the discussion would go , assuming they could even cope with the duality . . 
  what is often most shocking ( to me ) is how out of the blue these pms are ( again particularly the pms , where people take advantage of the lack of public scrutiny ) - i 'll be commenting on something completely dissociated from israel or religion only to find a `` well fuck you jew '' pop up in my inbox apropos of nothing in the thread ( or a `` well fuck you nazi '' . . ) , which can be jarring to say the least . 
  it must be fucking awful for people for whom it * is * personal though , even those who have learned to let idiots ' views roll off their backs as the cost of entry to the internet . 
  the sheer volume of casual , but earnest , bigotry must mean that people have to learn to deal with it , i guess , but it 's not cool they have to . 
  it 's good gaining the insight into others ' experiences though - it 's very hard to put oneself in someone else 's shoes , but this has certainly helped me . 
  you are joking right ? 
  who cares if they got some dumb medal during the cold war for having fought the commie partisans ( who were the least racist/sectarian of all combatants during wwii in the balkans ) , the chetniks are notorious for their depredations ( especially as they foreshadowed the present serbian wickedness which has been prevalent since the fall of the communists in the former yugoslavia ) . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  then here 's a video matching * exactly * as i asked for ( perhaps even from the same series as this post ? 
  ) : [ chetniks - serbian nazis ( collaborators ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eds1ugueeke ), 
  want more ? 
  here you go : [ serbian chetniks nazi collaborators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcsmwp3djvm ), 
  again , more : [ parade of serbian nazi collaborators in belgrade \\ ( 22 june 1944 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xwu1a6-xje ), 
  for more information , also : [ genocide & ethnic cleansing of bosniak muslims and croats around the srebrenica region in 1943 ; serbian chetniks collaborated with the nazis ] ( https://espressostalinist.com/genocide/chetniks-collaboration-genocide/ ), 
   hmmm ... 
  i 'm not sure , i guess it would be better off-reddit as a standalone article than to invite more creepy pms on here . 
  that would definitely be less unpleasant i think , and would allow for a more balanced discussion in greater depth . 
   at least when i get crazy pms it 's because of something i 've actually said . 
  yeah , i mean , i have definitely set them off somehow ( except one pm which i never figured out the cause of ) , but it is disconcerting how racism is the go to response to my contrarianism . . 
  to a tee !, 
  well if they got a medal for fighting nazis they should give it back because cetniks basically are nazis so it 's very dishonest of them to claim to have fought them . . 
  talk about historical revisionism . . 
  edit : removed unnecessary bs, 
  you still have n't answered though - are you a guy or a girl ? 
  what about when you were born ? 
  ha ha , yeah tbh that is how i knew ( or at least suspected . . ) what was going here too . 
  no , i do n't buy any of the trump bullshit either , but she was corrupt af , no two ways about it . 
  she was rotten through and through - that election had no good possible outcome . 
  trump is a neo-fascist freakshow , but at least he will hopefully implode under the weight of his own lunacy . 
  mate , the cetniks collaborated just as much as the ustase . 
  that 's what fucking happened . 
  us presidents are n't necessarily the most insightful figures , indeed the world 's premier purveyor of alt-facts is the current president . 
  australian . 
  i do n't have to show you shit mate , what 's the point in arguing over something so long finished with , and especially with someone who did n't even vote because of not even being a seppo ? 
  the impression hillary gave internationally , in the independent , unbiased press , was of a profoundly corrupt , self-serving and entitled individual who had long been bought by big business and clearly believed this presidency was her due as part of some clinton/bush dynastic bullshit . 
  if she is n't then she should n't have acted as though is . 
  really aussie - both my parents were born here , but part croatian with family in dalmatia and lots of croat , bosnian and serb friends here . 
  australia is like a second yugoslavia with the people , 
  i actually edited some of what i wrote . 
  i have nothing against serbs mate - i 've not been to serbia proper , but was in banja luka last year and loved it - nice place , with lovely people ( and great food ! ) . 
  i am not trying to say the usta\u0161e were alright , just add some balance - op is a mod of r/srpska ffs . . 
  cool . 
  qld . . 
  what 's that patch near his rifle 's pistol grip ? 
  whose face ? 
  do you know what its significance is ? 
  needs more centrelink symbols . . 
  r/hailcorporate ^ ^ 2, 
  yay !, 
  it was pretty obvious this day would come , but i for one am glad it 's arrived . 
  so funny watching how these arseholes turn on each other . . 
  yeah !, 
  why the fuck you want a toaster when you can just set your kitchen on fire and put the bread on a stick either ? 
  they are definitely the eat their own young sort , that 's for sure . 
  there was that elderly couple who were organising for her in wa , but then got thrown under the bus over some petty disagreement . 
  i almost felt sorry for them , but then i remembered they were stone-cold hateful bigots and my sympathy was replaced with a mocking laugh . 
   he 's not evil though . 
  he just wants to protect his country in a bad way . 
  look he is definitely protecting his country in a very bad way , so wrt that he 's achieving his goals , as stated and voted for , but there are definitely troubling aspects to him and his regime . 
  other authors explain it better than i could in the span of a reddit comment , but the whole `` trump is a democratic fascist '' thing is actually not hyperbolic , but rather is pretty reasonable ; if you 're interested in understanding what people mean , here 's a couple of articles :, 
  - https://warisboring.com/the-origin-of-american-democratic-fascism-9ef1d70e7e02#.7b996f472, 
  - http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-07/is-it-fair-to-call-trump-a-fascist/8328888,

  even if you read them and decide you do n't agree then at least you understand what the discussion is about , right ? 
  there are plenty more out there , as well as plenty arguing the opposite . . 
  that 's not to say he 's evil though , no . 
  .50 calibre , which is a proportion of inch - if it was 50 cal that would hundredths of an inch , but expressed as .50 it is 1/2 an inch ( which you can confirm by multiplying 12.7 mm by 2 to get 25.4 mm , or 1inch ) . 
  calibre is inches ~ ~ , so naval guns are like 54 cal ( or whatever ) as they are multiple inches . ~ ~ of internal barrel for small arms , but [ for artillery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caliber ) :, 
   `` caliber '' is used to describe the barrel length as multiples of the bore diameter . 
  a `` 5-inch 50 calibre '' gun has a bore diameter of 5 in ( 12.7 cm ) and a barrel length of 50 times 5 in = 250 in ( 6.35 m ) . 
  the main guns of the uss missouri ( iowa class battleship ) are 16 '' 50 caliber . 
  edit : corrected artillery statement, 
  that 's great , anything that helps preserve our native flora and fauna is to be applauded , and i particularly like tassie devils . 
  that cancer was wiping them out , if it can be controlled now it really is a significant development . 
  tasmania is a great place to see native species , such as tassie devils ( natch ) , but also platypus and echidnas , both of which are cute , funny little creatures if you can get close to them to see ; it 's very encouraging that conservation efforts such as that discussed in the article should allow aussies to continue to see our native creatures into the future . 
  i visited , and would recommend 100 % , [ the platypus house ] ( http://www.platypushouse.com.au/ ) in beauty point ( in the tamar valley , not too far from devonport if you are in the north of the island ) for platypus and echidnas , though to see the tassie devils you have to be down near hobart ( afaik - that was where we saw them at least ) . 
  that 's where we went too - it is a great spot ( and not too far from hobart ) . 
  tasmania is a lovely part of the country , definitely a great place to take a break for a week or so . 
  amazing scenery , good food culture , devils and platypuses and of course [ mona ] ( https://mona.net.au/ ) - one of the , if not the , best gallery/museums i have ever visited , anywhere imo . 
  would n't * real * americans just use a gun instead of a toaster though ?
