   the liberals are driven by ideology [ . . ] they do not listen to reason . 
  so , i guess you 'd make a * great * liberal then !, 
  why you are still supporting the australian losers posse mate ? 
  did you just assume her gender ? 
  message to the dad : i 'm not surprised your daughter got given the boot , giving how much of a whinging cunt you are mate . 
  you should really try to get her to aim higher than making fucking subway though , i mean most kids work fast food for pocket money , but she wanted to `` learn how to count '' as preparation for a `` career '' in hospitality . 
  not at all . 
  i 'm saying because instead of telling the shithead boss off like a man he just bitched to the paper , like some whiny little millennial , despite the fact he must surely be gen x given he has a 16yo kid . 
  though i suppose maybe he had her when he was 16yo ? 
  the family that aspires to a career with subway is perhaps not one that shares my social status or beliefs , so he could literally be a millennial now i think about it . . 
  mate , i do not eat fucking subway . 
  what do you take me for ? 
  that 's just fucked up . 
  read what i wrote again . 
  i was somewhat critical because he * did n't * stick up for his daughter properly , not because he `` stuck up for her '' . 
  tbf i * was * criticising the dad , not the 16yo *** , *** dude . 
  edit : added the comma - i assume you are all downvoting because you thought i meant the 16yo chick was a 16yo dude ? 
  ftr , i was just saying `` dude '' to the dude i replied to , so no need to get your knickers in a twist ~ ~ guys ~ ~ ~ ~ people ~ ~ r/australia subscribers . 
  oh , i wish i was as bright-eyed and naive as you are still . 
  you 're making me jealous !, 
  i bet subway are really hurting coz this muppet had a cry . 
  at least if he gave the boss a jolly good talking to he 'd feel better and the daughter would know her dad was n't * just * a whinging little prick . 
  you should be bill shorten . . 
  you think working at subway is `` performing essential work '' ? 
  right . 
  because eating subway is essential for survival of humans . . 
  except it 's really not . 
  i have eaten subway literally only twice in my entire life , and yet here i am , alive and well . 
  because subway is fucking shit food for shit people . 
  you seem to have confused this story with the penalty rates meme btw . 
  the `` problem '' here was that she was n't offered employment after her traineeship finished and she felt that people did n't waste enough of their time teaching her how to count and crap . 
  in other words , she is an entitled little fuck crying coz the world did n't do what she thought it should for her . 
  ironically , seeing as it 's the unions who sold fast food joint drone workers down the river for fun , profit and so the corrupt union bosses could fund corrupt alp politicians . . 
  one question : getting rid of the unions , would courts or camps be more efficient ? 
  what ? 
  mate , you need to untwist your knickers , just calm down and actually reread the convo , please . . 
  deep breaths , ok . 
  no , seriously , please . 
  which do you think would be more * efficient * ? 
  i would have thought the fact the visitor was n't being welcomed with those traditional southern hospitality symbols of a rope slung over a tree branch next to a burning cross should have been adequate to show it was n't the state of georgia in this case . . 
  not just the uk - australia , nz and everywhere i have been in europe too ( as far as i recall - given their ubiquity they are n't something i specifically remember . . ) . 
  i am judging americans a bit too , bloody savages . 
  how can one * not * have a kettle ? 
  i thought `` but whatabout labor '' arguments were verboten ? 
  why then is your `` whatabout abbott or turnbull '' acceptable ? 
  that 's all just whataboutism though when we 're discussing an article specifically about bill shorten . 
  the context is different for other parties , as the article makes quite clear when it brings up the fact that $ 60k is more than grassroots labor supporters ' median income . 
  labor claims to represent the interests of their grassroots supporters , but happily pisses such an individual 's * entire household income for a * *** year *** against a tree so bill wears the right colour tie and chloe 's shoes are * just right * ( not explicitly stated , but a reasonable assumption of matters a stylist might concern themselves with ) . 
  the article also answered your initial question wrt turnbull too btw : he did n't employ a stylist , and neither did his wife . 
  however , that 's another irrelevancy as people need to be measured against their own rhetoric in matters of personal comportment - precisely as the performance of the government must be measured against their own stated goals rather than the performance of a previous government , operating in a different economic and social context and from a different ideological position ( ie the crux of the `` fuck whataboutism '' argument in the first place ) . 
  tbf , i would assume that referred to ethnicity and generally expect people from the caucasus to explain that in those words ( ie i personally would expect someone from a georgia or dagestan , for example , to state their nationality or say `` i am from the caucuses '' rather than `` i am caucasian '' ) because the common usage of caucasian in english refers to being white . 
  however , i would n't refer to myself as caucasian personally as it is n't a particularly great descriptor of ethnicity ; should i ever feel the need to describe my own ethnicity i would probably prefer `` mainly northern european '' , `` mainly anglo-celtic '' or similar depending on context . 
  not intending to be be mean to op , but if you check her comment history it is * all * about this breakup in subs such as r/breakups . 
  personally i would advise trying to move on by finding different things to occupy her mind instead of dwelling on it . 
  i hope this does n't sound patronising , but you are still very young , and if this is the worst thing that ever happens in your life you will be very fortunate . 
  ( except that i would argue there are worse things that are absolutely inevitable , so nothing worse could only be the result of a very short life . ), 
  it may well feel like the worst thing ever right now , but in a year 's time it 's entirely possible you will look back and be thankful it happened . 
  try to find other things to fill your mind , though do n't ignore your feelings of hurt - better to grieve properly then put it behind you than live with an open wound . 
   i have n't seen offence this impressive since we took the sinai in 67, 
  glad you acknowledge that as an offensive action , not a defence . 
  your honest candour is a good thing , and i respect you for it . 
  it 's also extremely refreshing - you would be amazed how many israelis/pro-israelis try to claim it was defensive , lol . 
  sure that 's not chemtrails , just in the river ? 
  it * is * man . 
  you should come here . 
  we have vibrant jewish communities ( there have been jews in australia since the earliest days of our colonial-era ) of all persuasions from haredi to very secular , and it is a nice place to live . 
  if you are educated and/or skilled you could probably get a visa under a number of different programs without much hassle at all . 
  it 's a big decision , but i bet if you came on a holiday first you would feel very comfortable in this country . 
  well , it does if you do n't brush properly . 
  childhood obesity is an increasingly serious issue in many cultures too . 
  so , all things considered , cake is probably the last thing you should be giving a kid . 
  tbh , now i think about it , i would prefer it had my parents never given me cake , and if i have kids i will teach them to despise cake and all those who eat it . 
  edit : ohhhh , i get it - israel is the kid , who wants to both have his cake and eat it . . 
  great analogy . 
  lol ? 
  is n't the chicken only like 60 % chicken , and the rest sawdust or something . 
  saw a story about a dna test done recently on reddit . 
  didactic much there mate ? 
  and a complete non-sequitur , of course . 
  is that a copypasta ? 
  hey man , your comments above are funny !, 
  he got it all back though . . 
  the libs implemented an alp plan , no wonder there were teething troubles until they organised it properly . 
  maybe a norwegian forest cat , otherwise a maine coon . 
  not a steam gauge in sight . . 
  it 's not really an antonym for misogynist though , unless you consider men and women to be complete opposites and naturally in opposition to each other - which , if you do , probably says more about your own attitudes than those of the people you `` trigger '' . 
  it is rather the equivalent of misogynist for men . 
  one may be both misandrist and misogynist for example , and neither all misandrists are necessarily women nor are all misogynists necessarily men . 
  it 's dreadful that he had to endure the weeks of uncertainty - which must have caused great anxiety as well as the increased discomfort suffered while waiting for his ancillary programs to resume - but to claim he has `` lost '' access to these programs is ~ ~ disingenuous at best ~ ~ not quite correct as they were reinstated . 
  clearly , as he * was * able to have a review process correct the initial failures , the system is * perhaps * not as terrible as ~ ~ you would have us believe ~ ~ as you fear . 
  as a disabled person myself - i am a partial , incomplete , paraplegic who spent two-years trapped in a wheelchair ( although , after a great deal of excellent , entirely state-funded physiotherapy and personal effort in the gym i defied my prognosis , ie that i would never walk again , and do now walk ) and always will be - i know that mindless , obstructionist criticism of the system ( as is ~ ~ labor and their supporters ' ~ ~ too many ideologues ' wont ~ ~ - exemplified in this instance by your ignorant , biased and , i must say , discriminatory towards disabled people such as myself comment ~ ~ ) does absolutely nothing to help people trying to live with a disability . 
  if you give so much of a fuck why do n't you volunteer instead of mouthing off on reddit about shit you really do n't understand ? 
  in the circumstances faced by hundreds of thousands of disabled individuals around the country what is important is that the services they and their carers require * are * *** delivered *** , not just today , but for as long as they require , adapting as each individual 's circumstances and condition evolves . 
  for that to happen , the absolute prerequisites are ( and i know you will probably struggle with this , but , please , bear with me . . ) *** funding *** and *** organisation *** . 
  there is no doubt that the original ( labor ! ), 
  plan was flawed , and the * ( libs !, 
  ) * implementation has not been entirely smooth , but people who seek to white-ant the system because you view it purely through the lens of their ideology with not a whit of sympathy for those affected are not helping either . 
  please , * everyone * , score your points elsewhere . 
  sorry if this veered into ranting territory , but obviously it is an issue i feel strongly about due to my personal connexion not only in terms of empathy for those living with a disability and their carers ( without whom we would all be screwed ) , but also with all the amazing docs , physios , nurses , ots and etc who helped me so much . 
  our system here may not be perfect , but it 's actually pretty bloody good .
