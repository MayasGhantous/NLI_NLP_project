  here in wa labor sought to inflict the ndis on disabled people here , despite the state providing a higher quality of care than that mandated by labor 's policy - that was eventually resolved though and now a system is being implemented it needs to be supported . 
  not attacked for cheap , political kicks . 
  i am now fortunate enough to have moved past my disability and be living independently , working professionally full-time and pulling my weight in society ( i am in the highest income tax bracket . . ) , so this does n't directly impact my life , but i am still considerably closer to this particular issue than all the randoms here putting the boot into the government ( and fuck the cripples , eh ? ) . 
  if the system was failing people i would be up in arms , believe me , but it seems to be coming together . 
  just give it - and the nearly 1/2 million aussies directly reliant upon it - a fucking chance , would you ? 
  if ~ ~ you ~ ~ anyone reading does really care , i am quite sure local disability service providers would love a volunteer - alternatively , if like i you have limited time - there are many excellent charities who all need financial support . 
  i have money deducted every month by charities , and , more directly , also bought a couple of wheelchairs last year from this mob , who ( although their charity helps kids overseas rather than here which may or may not be an issue for someone so heavily ideologically driven , idk ? ), 
  do wonderful things constructing all-terrain wheelchairs for kids in 3rd-world countries : http://wheelchairsforkids.org/, 
  ~ ~ now , i know you will just mash that downvote button and move on , but please , at least try to consider some of what i have written . ~ ~ *** people are what matters here , not bloody politics . 
  edit : edited for fairness , may need some more fixing up after work still though . 
  i have crossed stuff out instead of deleting as i am happy to own my own mistakes - and yes , i was wrong about u/maevam personally . 
  the point still stands tho - please do n't use disabled , or otherwise vulnerable individuals to score political points . 
  that really frustrates me , and in all honesty is what underlies most of my disagreement with and disappointment in this sub 's denizens . 
   i really do n't want to go back to medieval culture where lords rule over the poor slaves who are granted land to feed armies . 
  you do n't ? 
  tbqh that is actually my dream . . 
  sorry if i took what you wrote the wrong way , but i just feel very strongly about people who try to use disabled people - or others who are similarly vulnerable - to point score . 
  i did n't read your other post yet , but i will have a look . 
  perhaps i misjudged * your * comment , but we have both seen those who would trample all over those directly affected mouthing off here before . 
  i am not saying the system could not and should not be improved ( it could * always * be improved , right ? 
  ) , but disabled people are reliant on it and it needs to be built-up , not knocked down ( especially not for politics ! ) . 
  i think we need to acknowledge the scale of what 's involved though and let people get on with it , not just snipe form the sidelines . 
  again , i am sorry if i misjudged your position - i just feel very strongly that this type of things should transcend factional differences and the focus needs to be on the people who both live with their disabilities *** and *** those who support them , whether that be in a volunteer , personal *** or *** professional capacity . 
  i guess i feel a bit protective of everyone involved , which does include those tasked with implementing this reorganisation - these people work very hard , and put a lot of themselves into helping people like us . 
  i hope your services are restored and your support continues . 
  it 's terrible that there has been a gap , but this is an immense effort to bring the whole country on-board and if we accept it was necessary we must also accept the costs of making the change . 
  that said , i really do hope you are n't waiting - and living with that dreadful uncertainty - long and the whole thing gets sorted out in your favour . 
  i had not read this post before , but clearly you are also somebody who is personally invested and so please accept my sincere apology for assuming you were not ; however , i do n't want to remove my other post as what i wrote still applies to others who * are * just white-anting . 
  i 'm at work so ca n't spend long now , but i may review it and edit to make it clear i have read this comment above later though . 
  ( it 's quite a long comment . . ), 
  i hope they get their act together quickly ( for everyone impacted generally , and you individually ) ; i watched this on tv last night , and while there have been some major fuck-ups , it does seem to be coming together . 
  i will keep an eye out for your comments in future , and will be very happy if one day soon i see you being able to post that your services have resumed . 
  all the best . 
  the dismantling of the previous system was something i have always questioned - some disruption was pretty much inevitable , and *** any *** disruption will cause an huge amount of anxiety and stress for everyone who relies upon government assistance ( even the worry they might be negatively affected will have have a terrible effect on people ) . 
   the turnbull government accused of `` holding the disabled to ransom '' and labor refusing to admit the $ 22 billion scheme lacks $ 4 billion in funding, 
  *** this *** is *** exactly *** what i was railing against in my earlier post , and i am appalled . 
  any society may be judged by how it treats its weakest members , and in this instance - as described in the link - both sides have failed us all ( not just we who are disabled , but our entire culture imo ) by bickering over it : fiddling while rome burns barely covers the depth of the betrayal involved . 
  i hope to fuck they sort themselves out and stop using people as pawns . 
  it is disgusting , and yes - it needs to be talked about because surely such behaviour can only flourish in the dark . . 
  i am really so sorry i assumed you were just using this as a soapbox , please forgive my cynicism . 
  thanks for the link , it was n't pleasant reading , but i was n't directly cognisant of its contents previously . 
  thank you for being gracious about it !, 
  i agree talking about improvement is necessary , but i do really feel for the people tasked with implementing it - when dealing with a disability ( mine was a spinal cord injury from an infection that caused an epidural abscess in my spine . . ) one spends such a lot of time with the professionals who work to provide these services that , as i say , i have been left feeling quite protective towards *** all *** those who helped me through ( which includes administrators ) , and i just want them to be able to get on with their jobs without people making their lives any more difficult than they inherently are given the scale and nature of the task . 
  i fear that these people are going to be used as a football between all those who do seek political gain from the situation . 
  i also feel that , whatever the system that is in place , the system needs to be allowed to function - free from political interference . 
  anyway , i must crack on with my work , but i am glad we talked more , and again really do hope to see you commenting that things came together for you soon !, 
  i will definitely keep an eye out for your comments wrt this issue in future too . 
   we have always had it pretty good here i reckon . 
  i had a service for five years when in many countries i 'd have had nothing , ever . 
  and australian people are kind . 
  i desperately want it to stay good here . 
  that is *** exactly *** how i feel - i often say ( on those occasions when i discuss my experiences , which are n't all that frequent as i prefer to move forward rather than look back and do n't want fake sympathy for something i have largely overcome ! ), 
  that i thank being an aussie for my recovery because i probably would not have recovered in many other countries . 
  here it literally cost me nothing ( between private health cover and medicare ) for major surgery on my spine , then months in the hospital , then months in the rehab hospital , then about a year of physio as an outpatient and ongoing monitoring and care to this day - in the us that would have bankrupted me , while in the uk i fear i would not have been allocated sufficient resources for the intense rehab i was provided . 
  i thank my lucky stars every day i was born an aussie , and i too hope with all my heart that it continues for every one of us here . 
  gtg ( do some work !, 
  ) , but will see you in the threads no doubt !, 
  ha ha , yeah i certainly do remember you and was being perfectly genuine when i said your comments are funny - even though you 're taking the mickey out of my comments and my country ( australia ) you still made me laugh !, 
  in honour of our mutual reasonableness i will ` fess up to you that i was well aware mr ferretrape did not mean to say the '67 invasion was an act of aggression ; however , when i saw what he wrote i could n't resist . 
  he is normally such an intransigent chap that it was just too funny . 
  furthermore , i will admit to understanding the israeli perspective that it was a preemptive defensive move , though i must say also i possess some reservations about how necessary it was . . 
  as the eventual , long-term , outcome was the israel-egypt peace deal of the late - '70s though ( via yk in ' 73 ) - which i think we can all agree is better than the state of affairs that preceded it - i ca n't say it was categorically wrong . 
  like so many facets of the history it is not , imo , black-and-white ( as i painted it ) , but is rather something much more nuanced and shaded . . 
  hurr derr - you 're funny af mate . 
  you should start a youtube channel of you doing stand-up . 
  if it gets enough views then hey , maybe you can get off the dole and become a lifter too . 
  certainly i think it 's a more appropriate path for someone with the wits you possess than a normal career job would be mate !, 
  and you , my friend , are * [ very smart ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart ) * . 
  give yourself a gold star . 
  in all seriousness though , i * would * love a return to the feudal system . 
  my family background , friends and professional status are all enough to ensure i would be a member of , if not the actual lords , then certainly the knights . 
  oh , imagine how much fun it would be !, 
  putin and trump starring ? 
   she said since the incident james has suffered `` intense social criticism '' , threats to his own safety and had lost his job because his employer could not guarantee his safety . 
  sorry , but boo-fucking-hoo . 
  that 's what happens when you think your mate attacking a quokka is so funny you have to share it with the world . . 
  i just hope he learns the right lesson from this , ie do n't stand there while people are being cunts rather than do n't upload it !, 
  oops , thank you for telling me . 
  let me just say this attack is dreadful and i hope the victims are alright . 
   few years down the line everyone will have a laugh at the story of him and the quokka video . 
  sadly , i think your conclusion is probably right , but idk if people will ever laugh about it with him . 
  nobody likes people who abuse animals , and i do n't see that changing . 
   i was thinking more of the naked mountebank with the flute jammed up his arse . 
  that 's somewhat of a non-sequitur , i do n't see how it relates to what i wrote . 
  or even how it makes any sense whatsoever in context . 
  you were just waiting to use that line , were n't you , regardless of * what * i wrote ? 
  you were either dying to use the word mountebank , or have had the image of me with a flute jammed up my arse pleasantly occupying your thoughts for the past few hours . . 
  i must say though you 're are sounding a bit mountebankphobic there . 
  not cool man , not cool . . 
  i hope he does realise that i was only poking ( gentle ) fun . . 
   i agree the peace deal was the best thing for everyone :d now if we can only increase our ties with those countries and communicate with their people too, 
  that would be great , though it seems to me that each country presents difficulties - i was disappointed to read of the extent to which the jordanian terrorist just released from prison after twenty years ( not long enough ! ), 
  for murdering the israeli schoolgirls was feted by the population , despite the reasonable military/leadership ties between israel and the jordanians , or the jordanian royal family at least . . 
  israel and egypt seem to be cooperating reasonably well at a government/security level too , but i must confess i do n't know how the egyptian man-in-the-street feels ? 
  it 's easy to criticise either one side or the other , but positive developments take two to tango just as much - if not more so - as conflict does . 
  it 's a shitty story , but if you 're interested in what i was writing about it 's here : http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-13/man-fined-after-pleading-guilty-to-filming-quokka-attack/8349474, 
  no wonder i could n't bring the painting to which you referred to mind . 
  you do realise that 's bosch , not brueghel , right ? 
  or - and forgive me for not being an art student here please - is bosch considered brueghelesque ? 
  i must confess my notions of brueghel 's themes and styles are somewhat different from my notions of bosch 's , but , as i said i 'm no art student . .
