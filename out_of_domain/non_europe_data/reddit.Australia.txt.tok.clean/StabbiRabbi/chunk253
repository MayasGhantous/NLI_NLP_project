  yeah , my ( bosniak ) mate here is australia 's wife is egyptian and she does n't hate israel or israelis ( in fact neither of them do ) . 
  otoh , we all know egypt has its share of islamist nutters too . . 
  i guess egyptians - just like aussies or israelis - defy being put into one neat little box , tempting as it is for us to try . 
  generalisations can definitely be useful for some things and are often tempting , but one must be careful when thinking about people in that regard . . 
  as far a security goes , the egyptian military and idf also cooperate against isis in the sinai i believe . 
  it 's all much better than the ' 53 - '73 run of wars , that 's for sure !, 
  edit : typo, 
  obviously people getting stabbed is worse than an animal being kicked , but i think there is perhaps a common thread - some people are just arseholes with something not right in their minds . 
  thank you , but i ca n't actually claim that honour , not from the last federal elections anyway . 
   she claimed surveillance could be conducted with `` microwaves that turn into cameras , '' and added : `` we know this is a fact of modern life . '', 
  right . 
  so i guess this one of those `` alt-facts '' we hear so much about these days then , is it ? 
   at least we know who the unions work for . 
  yeah , generally their own self-interest , more specifically that of their leaders . 
  certainly not their members , not for a long time if the outcomes they `` acheive '' for said members are any guide . 
  unions have definitely played an important role historically in establishing labour laws , but for the unions of today - especially the mua , perhaps * the * most thuggish and openly corrupt of australian unions , at least in wa - to * demand * cabinet seats speaks very clearly of their attitude and mo , ie entitlement and bullying . 
  if mcgowan stands up to the mua he will immediately rise in my estimation considerably . 
  really . . 
  do you have a link to a mass-market internet enabled , camera and microphone equipped ( so i guess voice activated ? ), 
  microwave currently on sale , as i would like to purchase such a product . 
  i just googled `` microwave oven internet '' and , apart from reviews of one lg product from ' 05 , every link on the first couple of pages was about how people 's microwaves are fucking up their wifi connexion . 
  i agree we do live in an era when the extent of surveillance to which we are subjected is a matter of concern , but would love to learn how i can connect to facebook using my microwave . 
  shit , if i can do that i might even start using facebook again . . 
  it 's a very human thing to do , categorisation of others , something to do with ancient survival mechanisms , from when we * needed * to make quick judgements about situations - or other people - or risk unpleasant consequences i have read . 
  however , it 's not great because it 's not fair and it really opens the door to ( mutual ) misunderstanding and misplaced antipathy . . 
  did you even read that ? 
  it 's not about microwave * ovens * , lol . . 
  if you read the context she is clearly talking about consumer electronics . 
  not microwaves is the physics sense . 
  but she * works for * `` the conniving propaganda machine '' . . 
  same to you man . 
  you may well be right looking at it again , though it 's much funnier if we assume she * was * talking about microwave ovens , lol . 
   some men pee sitting down, 
  yes . 
  yep , that 's how it works . . 
  those things are creepy af . . 
   crossing swords, 
  i know what * that 's * a euphemism for . . 
  pa\u0161ki sir ( cheese from pag island ) with pr\u0161ut ( dry-cured ham ) makes a damn nice sandwich imo . 
  sand cat , or sand dune cat . 
  ha ha , yeah - your last try went so well for you . 
  are n't parts of belgrade * still * smoking rubble ? 
  meanwhile , bih is lovely , while republika srpska is poor af . 
  free of possessions , is that what you 're thinking of ? 
  that shit would piss me the fuck off . 
  sorry , if that was n't what you meant then i misinterpreted your comment . 
  i have removed my previous comments . 
  yeah , more like `` thanks union thugs '', 
  i have noticed a few people in this sub writing `` perse '' instead of `` per se '' . 
  why do they do that ? 
  ha ha , i se what you did there . . 
  croatia is a much poorer country than australia too , both at an individual and national level ; i really do n't think we ought to be dumping wayward aussies onto them . 
  imo this woman is as aussie as any of us here , she 's lived here essentially her entire life and all of her family are here including both her surviving parent and her direct descendants . 
  i agree foreigners who disregard our laws should be deported , but question whether - morally , if not technically - she * is * `` a foreigner '' . 
  it sounds as though she is more sick than dangerous to our society : if she was robbing banks or bashing people i would not have bothered to type a word in her defence , but her offences , although repeated , are not of that magnitude . 
  yes , she was issued warnings , but , as the lawyer quoted says , these are of dubious import legally themselves and , as she says , it is little wonder she felt unable to pursue citizenship in their wake . 
  overall it sounds as though she was left somewhat lacking in life skills , a fault directly attributable to our society . 
  the burden she would be on croatia is significantly greater than that she imposes on us , both in absolute terms ( given her entire support network is in australia ) and proportionally ( given how much richer we are as a nation ) ; however , the really awful factor is that she probably will die if dumped half-way across the world in a country where she does n't even speak the language . 
  you seem interested in the subject , so would you mind terribly please helping me out by answering a quick straw poll question ? 
  to remove unionism from our society , which do you think would be more efficient & effective : courts , or camps ? 
  please do n't answer as to your opinion wrt whether we ought to do so or not , i really am solely interested in which path you think would help achieve the end most quickly , thoroughly and permanently . 
  obviously a complete final solution to the union question will eventually require both , so just consider the question in terms of laying a solid foundation for such an eventual solution . 
  once i have completed my policy paper and published it for review we can debate the necessity of completely excising the cancer of the union gangs vs just decapitating their leadership and declawing them . 
  i 'm going to put that down as `` camps '' then . 
  looks great - i had never been a fan of big occy , preferring baby , till recently , but having tried some excellent slow roasted big octopus i am now a big fan . 
  when done right ( as this looks to be ) it really is excellent . 
  looking good there - shiny coat , wet nose , bright eyes and a massive smile !, 
  yes , trump is as wonderful for muslims - especially their relationship with the west - as the ksa is itself imho . 
   before palestinian was even a word, 
  have to call bullshit on that one : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palestine#etymology, 
  the word philistine is the root of `` palestine '' , and is believed to predate the israelite immigration by a significant period - it exists in the archaeological record earlier than any `` proof '' of jewish inhabitants living in the region . 
  ergo the rest of your comment is also not necessarily correct . 
  great planes , and the rf-101 saw a fair bit of action up north during the vietnam war . 
  the first recce voodoos to fly in vietnam were flown in to `` perform at an airshow '' in 1961 ( long before any other direct us involvement ) , while also secretly performing recon missions over nvn . 
  needless to say the ruse was n't effective for long , but it is an interesting little aspect of the vietnam air war and voodoo 's history alike !, 
  the story is told [ here ] ( https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ktdmawaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa28&amp;lpg=pa28&amp;dq=rf-101+voodoo+vietnam+air+show&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dss0rpa0ap&amp;sig=8ay5vjeflzby2yvajx4f8n-5e3i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj6so68jdjsahvnsfqkhxakae8q6aeiujal#v=onepage&amp;q=rf-101%20voodoo%20vietnam%20air%20show&amp;f=false ) ( sorry , wo n't let me cut and paste as is google books ) . 
  made a nice pad thai for dinner from scratch using a bunch ingredients bought from the chinese supermarket and vietnamese grocers last night . 
  i really like those shops , and the people who run them . 
  i had n't used a few of the ingredients before so had no idea what i was looking for , but they were really helpful and i found everything i needed . 
  i use [ australia online ] ( http://australiaonline.net.au/ ) , who are a small isp/rsp , for my fttp nbn - i pay for 100/100 and get damn near that almost all the time . 
  excellent customer service too , they always go the extra mile to help whenever i have had any issues . 
  just checked it then and got 92.6 down on my tablet , which if you account for the loss over wifi gives me a speed i am more than happy with . 
  how did i know you were going to link that one song ? 
  so that speaks to you about your life , does it ? 
  welp , i feel bad for your mum matey . 
  no , if i was trying to be offensive i dare say you would be offended . 
  i was asking a serious question . 
  you * really * relate to that story , it reasonates with your own experiences ( as you effectively implied in your op above ) does it ? 
  as i said before , if that is the case i genuinely feel terrible for your poor mother . 
  have you not listened to the lyrics ? 
  maybe chop out a few inches from your thighs/shins ? 
  i 'm 5 ' 11 '' and white as they come ( if i do n't get any sun for a couple of weeks i glow in the dark . . ) , but , as mentioned , they could not have been more helpful . . 
   you had nothing to do with what your ancestors did . 
  so why should i care about your ancestry of normal conquerors ? 
   because these are the people waiting for me when i die . 
  family is everything . 
   could your ancestors even write ? 
  is this guy for real ? 
  the funny thing is he probably ca n't actually prove shit - tracing back 28 generations is bloody hard , unless you are the queen ( for example ) and this is just some random crap some relative of his pulled off that notorious mormon soul-harvesting site , ancestry.com . 
  or maybe even from a dna test , as is beloved of these seps to help assuage their crushing identity issues . .
