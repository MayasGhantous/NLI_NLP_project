  sorry , but i do n't see any point in continuing this conversation . 
  hey !, 
  that 's not cool man , not cool . . 
  yep that was it , the araluen one ( held in vic park this year - and for the next few years - though ) . 
  it was a really good event , about a hundred stalls with a whole bunch of different sauces makers selling their wares ( each offering samples ) , other stuff like chilli peanut brittle ( very nice too , though i did n't buy any ) , plenty of interesting food to eat and beer available from a few different vendors . 
  oh , and a ( plant ) nursery section selling chilli plants . 
  good chillies , like ghosts , naga vipers , scorch bonnets and so on down to cayennes and jalapenos . 
  it was a great day - 10/10 would recommend for next year . 
  have you tried any of these ? 
  shit the bed is getting pretty well known around town now , deservedly so , but most of these guys were new to me . 
  will definitely keep buying them though , these sauces are great . 
  bunster 's do shit the bed in 7/10 , 12/10 and 16/10 ( where `` 10 '' is 1m scu afaik ) and all are nice , apparently it 's starting to pop up in some igas and butchers now , but ordering online is really easy . 
  definitely recommend all of the ones pictured if you like it really hot , or they all do sauces at different intensities too . 
  i like the internationals too , but it 's nice to try some local product . 
  have you seen the [ 50states american foodmart ] ( https://www.facebook.com/50statesinperth/ ) range of sauces ? 
  they have some hot ones there , good selection . 
  no worries mate , happy to help a fellow hot sauce loving perthian out any time !, 
  not my side mate - i am a genuinely impartial , uninvolved observer . 
  i certainly have closer ties to jews and israel than palestine in the sense of people i know , largely professionally . 
  i like and respect them all . 
  my thoughts on this conflict are informed primarily from reading - and i read very widely , from all kinds of sources both historical and contemporary . 
  my views are a result of my considered and inherently unbiased observation of both the events as they unfold and the narrative each side pushes . 
  there are far greater problems with what you are proposing , the gross area of land is a relatively trivial issue . 
  you must know this and that 's why i cbf telling it to you again . 
  your style of argument really does the substance of your argument no favours . 
  it is also a significant factor in how i ended up forming the views i hold - reading literally your comments , as well of course as those of your colleagues , actually had the opposite effect to that you strive so hard to achieve . 
  as the bard puts it : methinks the lady doth protest too much . 
  you know it 's definitely an stb sauce as the flavours are all there , which is what i really like about stb in the first place . 
  i find stb to be a great general purpose hot sauce and the bl is too , just with a bit more kick . 
  i have it on eggs for brekkie , use it as a steak sauce , put it is salad dressing and cook with it , it 's just a great all-rounder . 
  that chef kenny is pretty awesome , definitely recommend tracking a bottle down if you like it hot . 
  my local raaf museum has a lancaster , which i was let into to have a look around . 
  sat down at a radio operator 's station just like that , it was great . 
  i make a dish very much like this , but with prawns - it 's a great recipe and only takes 30 mins from start to finish , with only one pan to clean afterwards . 
  you 'll see when you believe it . . 
  what 's that , stock response # 363 ? 
  equally , israel should acknowledge that it is the fact the regime routinely - reflexively in fact - ignores any and all criticism as `` baseless '' , brushing it off as `` antisemitic in origin '' , and have not yet had the sanctions imposed that leads to the repeated criticism . 
  think of israel as a naughty child that keeps stealing cookies from the cookie jar , and beating its little sister up for her share of the cookies ( a very apt analogy for many issues relating to israel imo ) - do you tell this bad kid to stop only once even though it keeps doing the same thing , or do you keep telling it that the behaviour is unacceptable ? 
  the answer is of course to actually issue sanctions/travel bans against israeli regime leadership members , settler leaders and settlement businesses instead of issuing these repeated criticisms . 
  current and former idf members should also be arrested on entry to western nations and held until such point as there is a war crimes tribunal ready to review their service records/crimes . 
  were such measures introduced israel would be enjoying the same treatment as its fellow human rights violator/rogue nuclear power , north korea , and there would be no need to issue repeated resolutions asking israel politely to stop its litany of horrors in occupied palestine . 
  that is n't what i said though , is it ? 
  of course the sanctions should be imposed only while the abuses continue - otherwise they would be completely unfair . 
  israel actions should only be criticised when they are deserving of criticism . 
  my suggestion of targeted sanctions against the regime/settlers rather the entire nation and millions of perfectly decent , normal israelis who are not active participants in the colonisation of palestine is suggested precisely so only those responsible for the crimes are impacted ; the last thing i would want to see is israel not being rewarded for real improvements should these ever occur and the goal of sanctions should be to engender improvements in the situation that will allow the sanctions to be removed . 
  yeah , dr paul 's is awesome . 
  definitely no false advertising . . 
  i will have a look around for them , i am always keen to broaden my collection of sauces and especially to give the aussie sauce producers a go !, 
  thanks for the tips . 
  ok , but who is saying israel has to be criticised ? 
  i agree with you entirely - israel is n't some inherently evil entity that inexorably requires censure no matter what , and certainly should not be treated as such . 
  that is not what *** i *** am saying though , and i do n't think i have * ever * seen * anyone * saying that no matter what , israel must be criticised . . 
  iffv ( i field force vietnam ) was a corps level command in vietnam , under macv and responsible for the ii corps tactical zone ao ( central highlands ) . 
  there was also ii field force that operated in iii ctz ( iii corps tactical zone - around saigon , but above the mekong delta ) . 
  these field forces had mainly brigade level units directly subordinate to them , but also their own corps-level lrrp units and etc , i would guess these guys are probably from a tunnel rat unit directly subordinate to iffv in the same manner as their lrrps were . 
  i agree that should be removed , yes , but that was n't what i was talking about . 
  iirc the history of the unhrc that would be an artefact of the organisation 's creation in the immediate wake of israel 's attacks on and the displacement of palestinians during the '47 war/nakba ; however , since the organisation 's role and scope has expanded , and so much has happened since , agenda item 7 does seem anachronistic and unfair . 
  that said , examination does not mandate criticism , which arises from abuses . . 
  this is from a brilliant album , one of my favourites from the era . 
  my bottle of this has maybe three drams left in it , which i am trying to juggle saving and not letting oxidise . 
  good review . 
  they only deployed very recently , replacing the dutch apaches . 
  interesting to see . 
  except trident , which is a pretty bloody big stick and should be considered an option . 
  most people outside the usa do n't . 
  why would she ? 
  she is in favour of disregard for the rule of law - she ca n't say it 's ok for her to ignore it , then run crying to the lawyers . . 
  oh wait , she 's a union thug . 
  she 'll do whatever she pleases i guess . 
   as long as *** she thinks *** that slander is a just law then there would n't be any contradiction in her starting a law suit . 
  [ emphasis my own . ], 
  given the union 's history in australia ( painters & dockers ? 
  cfmeu ? ), 
  it 's a given she ca n't be trusted upon to *** think *** beyond her own corrupt self-interest . 
  the painters and dockers evidently *** thought *** laws against shooting gangster rivals were unjust - one must expect her to act in precisely the same manner . 
  did you just assume their genders ? 
  how insightful , and what a * solid * refutation of my argument . . 
  do you deny the history ? 
  have you read about the p&d ( who later were absorbed by the mua ) ? 
  unionism in australia unfortunately goes hand-in-hand with savage thuggery and criminal activity : when the union godmother here says she 'll break any law that is inconvenient and the best labor has is to this day a former union bagman ( who also has credible allegations of stand-over tactics and even rape against his name ) it is impossible for any reasonable non-ideologue aussie to conclude the unions have changed a whit either . 
  that 's just pure whataboutism mate . 
  you 're argument is basically that `` everyone 's doing it , so it 's all good '' . 
  it 's really not though , two wrongs do not make a right . 
  we are n't talking about the libs here though , are we ? 
  this is an article about mcmanus - if it had anything to do with the libs i would be happy to discuss them , but it simply is not what is under discussion here . 
  that 's why reading your comment the only reasonable interpretation is that you are saying `` union thuggery is fine because there are other thugs in politics too '' . 
  nice try mr policeman . . 
  yet another argument for reconsidering prohibition , at least so far a pot goes . 
  whatever one 's opinion on smoking it , i think we can all agree this simply would n't have happened if it was sold in shops like booze is . 
   they 're trying to keep an unskilled , easily supplicated dangerously vulnerable workforce employed, 
  is that why they accept payments from employers ? 
  like medicare being stopped , or people who had legitimate centrelink debts claiming to be robodebt victims ? 
  that type of thing ? 
  the problem is most people do n't critically assess anything , unfortunately , but just get outraged and start mouthing off . . 
  are they crossed with rotties ? 
  none in terms of flavoured soft drink , but i * do * drink at least 2l of sparkling mineral water ( water with gas ) per day . 
  i was just thinking of notable recent fake news stories from australia . 
  frankly i am flabbergasted that the alp want to go down this path . 
  i think it 's great , but it does make me question their thought processes . . 
  given it 's dastyari behind it , one does have to wonder if the benefit is to his masters in beijing rather than the alp though .
