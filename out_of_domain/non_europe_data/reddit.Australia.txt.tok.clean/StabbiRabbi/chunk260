  i know you are capable of critical thought , so why just spout this type of nonsense ? 
  if you are , for whatever reason , enamoured of the unions that 's your prerogative ; however , may i ask , do you * really * think her making decent , everyday aussies concerned she will go to any lengths to inflict her agenda upon them , up to and including the premeditated commission/committing of egregiously criminal acts is `` doing the right thing '' ? 
  they are n't threatening to ignore the rule of law if they do n't get their own way though , are they ? 
  the international union movement has inevitably performed a huge service to western nations ' culture , i would never dispute that for a moment ; however , especially in the context of australia 's notoriously corrupt and criminally tainted union movement , how can * anyone * who believes they can pick and choose which laws they think are `` just '' is `` doing the right thing '' ? 
  big business certainly needs to be held accountable for their malfeasance as and when it occurs , but that does n't justify anyone not only threatening us all with her intention to behave as she pleases , but also encourage others ( who may well be even less stable/moral than she ) to do so too by boasting of it and providing justifications/excuses !, 
  how is that reasonable , ethical or moral behaviour ? 
  who is she to decide which laws are `` unjust '' ? 
  our society provides plenty of legal avenues for effecting change to the system without flouting the laws of the land - we do n't live under any kind of totalitarian system that needs `` resistance '' ( the only possible justification for such behaviour ) , we are not repressed - we live in what is objectively one of the best countries in the world to live in by almost any measure !, 
  of course we need to make sure that we keep being a great society and nation ; yes , that does require vigilance and for people to speak up , but we do not need any citizen embarking on a campaign of vicious vigilantism as mcmanus advocates . 
  it may appeal to juvenile minds filled with thought sof manning the barricades , but in actual fact there is * nothing * noble about her attitude . 
  why do you keep trying to deflect attention away from their behaviour and back to that of big business ? 
  i am not disputing that business needs to behave ethically too , but two wrongs do not make a right - ever . 
  i assume the intransigent silence is because deep down you know that this criminality is not acceptable , no matter how `` principled '' she tries to make it sound ? 
  wrt to the link between unions and crime in australia , may i ask if you are aware of the painters and dockers union ( later merged with the mua . . ) ? 
  before you start saying the australian union movement is not tainted by criminality , please look up their history . 
  also search under `` h division '' wars , pat shannon and billy `` the texan '' longley . . 
  then please refer to the recent royal commission into union corruption . 
  check out the facebook group members of the sda have set up to protest their representatives ' exploitation of them ( seeing as the sda managed somehow to escape the rc spotlight - dodgy in and of itself , and perhaps a nexus between business , who pays the sda off , and union corruption ) . 
  ( and before you ask , yes i would support a royal commission into banking . ), 
  then , if you are being honest not only with me , but with yourself , can you * really * say there is *** no *** taint of corruption surrounding the aussie union movement . 
  here 's a quote from an anu study that might help :, 
   the phenomenon has also been studied by the australian national university , which produced a report called perceptions of corruption and ethical conduct ( 2012 ) , which concluded : `` there is a widespread perception that corruption in australia has increased '' and that `` the media , *** trade unions *** and political parties *** were seen as australia 's most corrupt institutions *** .

  edit : forgot a `` no '' ( now highlighted ) , a very significant `` no '' lol, 
  that is just more whataboutism - we are discussing the unions ' lies , criminality and endemic corruption here and now , not that of the banks . 
  ( the banks get a good going over here in r/australia on a regular basis what 's more , so there is not even any need to `` raise '' the issue in this particular thread . . ), 
  p&d is simply the most outrageous unionist behaviour ( that we are currently aware of ) , not the sole example . 
  the whiff of corruption still taints the alp - and even ms mcmanus herself - to this day , with gillard and shorten both very lucky to have escaped punishment for their involvement in payoffs and other malfeasance . 
  as you simply will not address the subject at hand , but rather keep trying to deflect attention and at best cherry-pick single points to misrepresent in your response there is zero point in trying to continue this conversation - you have made your ostrich-esque `` head in the sand '' attitude more than clear enough . 
  i am not going to beat my head against the brick wall of your amorality and intellectual dishonesty any longer . 
  well , you just seem to want the unions - who destroy jobs in australia - to dominate the one thing every job needs ri simply exist , an employer 's business . 
  the only logical inference is that you want to see unemployment rise . 
  i ask again - could you please provide your evidence that big business directs liberal candidates ? 
  a ) i never said there were no good unions , let alone good union members and i explicitly acknowledged the good unions have done in general . 
  b ) i have criticised employers exploiting workers , here in r/australia and irl and in no way condone it in the least . 
  when did i say employers should be free to exploit employees ? 
  unions certainly have a role as part of the social landscape , but they are n't somehow above the law , despite their propaganda . 
  * that * is what pisses `` people like me '' off . 
  i can edit it if you honestly ca n't see past the ravages of autocorrect ? 
  what the unions say their purpose is and the effect they have are entirely add odds . 
  so you admit the libs do n't operate as the alp does with the unions in terms of untoward influence ? 
  slippery slope is a logical fallacy , and australia is one of the most free nations globally according to the freedom index . 
  we are nowhere near not being able to protest , that is a strawman - another logical fallacy . . 
  yeah , i had it on vinyl , then when i sold my record players i bought the cd . 
  it 's a stone-cold classic . 
   if you 're arguing for greater accountability for comments by union leaders and politicians , then i totally agree . 
  definitely , equal attention should be paid to both imo and both must be held to the same standards . 
  it 's chilling how determined this regime is to continue to feed the flames of conflict in the middle east . 
  trailerception ? 
  i do n't know why you want unemployment to rise , it seems utterly perverse to me . 
  at the risk of sounding repetitive , it 's the only logical inference from your comments . 
  specifically your support for unionism . 
  yes , spot on . 
  gingers you mean ? 
  are you being deliberately obtuse ? 
  we agree it 's axiomatic that unions destroy jobs , beyond that it 's simply joining the dots . 
  union politics 101 perhaps , though i believe the word you 're looking for is actually propaganda . 
  ( both start with a ` p ' , perhaps that 's where the confusion has arisen from ? ), 
  anyway , tell that the australian car manufacturing industry . . 
  i do n't know exact prices yet as my mate who imported it is working out costs , but i am sure the price quoted by the guy below is more than we 'll pay here , by some amount just for the tower itself with none of the other kit . 
  i ca n't speak for singapore pricing , but the price in singapore seems pretty fair compared to other similar ready to go systems i have looked at in australia and the usa . 
  obviously if one builds one 's own it 's a different story pricewise , but this is so simple to setup/use and easy to maintain . 
  he is also incorrect about only being suitable for herbs , given we 're growing vegetables and people in singapore are growing things like watermelons ( with the assistance of stockings to support the fruit 's weight ) . 
  very similar systems are also being used commercially to grow strawberries too . 
  edit : i 'm sure because i was at his place last night and we were discussing his preliminary costings . 
  right , and the car manufacturing industry is closing down . 
  it 's closing down because it cost four times as much to manufacture a car here as it does in asia , or twice as much as it does in germany . . 
   there are several reasons for the closure of australia 's car manufacturing industry . 
  the australian market is too small and the industry can not fully exploit economies of scale . 
  to remain solvent they have no choice but to use cheaper foreign production inputs including both labour and parts . 
  * the domestic market conditions in australia has become untenable with a ) the lowering of import tariffs and the signing of free trade agreements * ; *** b ) higher wages and better work conditions demanded by the unions *** ; and c ) the appreciation of the australian dollar . 
  *** it is very difficult to compete when labour costs in some asian countries are only one-fourth of that of australia . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://www.swinburne.edu.au/news/latest-news/2016/10/collapse-of-australian-car-manufacturing-industry-.php ) from swinburne university , not even the `` right-wing press '' of the abc , sbs and etc ( as you would no doubt refer to them ) . . 
  bury your head in the union sand all you want , this is the reality of contemporary australian unionism . 
  this and of course corruption , disregard for the rule of law , etc , etc. 
  right so , * you 're * somehow pro-jobs *** and *** pro-union . . 
  look , let 's leave it here . 
  clearly you 're not ready to examine your prejudices under the light of objective reason , and i do n't want to upset you . 
  only person ? 
  take off those blinkers :, 
  so , no . 
  not the only person . 
  as you are now proven 100 % wrong in that , perhaps you might reconsider certain other `` truths '' you hold so dear ? 
  i hate arguing with ideologues . 
  i did n't say you wish you were unemployed , but the facts are unions damage businesses which in turn leads to a reduction in the number of jobs available and the unions ' corruption/malfeasance also drives other jobs offshore . 
  ergo , by supporting unionism you are actually supporting the elimination of aussie jobs . 
  you might * think * you are in favour of jobs , but that 's just a side-effect of drinking the union koolaid . 
  please refrain from constructing strawmen . 
  there you go mate , was n't so hard , was it ? 
  were n't the classifications removed because of the funding model ? 
  no funding for aspergers per se , but there was under autism ( as an example ) . . 
   you will recall and remember how important the mail from home was . 
  how after many days of `` jungle bashing '' , on return to nui dat , the mail parade was eagerly looked forward to . 
   or if you had been out scrub for a while , and you were lucky enough , the mail came out on a huey with the normal rations re-supply . 
   in the latter 1960 's all sorts of strikes and embargoes were forced upon the australian troops serving in south vietnam on the pretext of `` helping the aussie digger in south vietnam '' . 
   all too often these strikes and embargoes were to the detriment of the average australian soldier in south vietnam . 
  the mail was delayed and did n't turn up . 
   the jeparit was n't loaded by the wharfies , was delayed and in the end the army loaded the jeparit . 
   the various campaigns and strikes against the war in south vietnam was unfortunately aimed at the individual soldiers and was to have a great impact upon the average australian soldier serving in south vietnam . 
   it is of no wonder then that they were to feel aggrieved by these strikes and other actions which took away their few basic essentials , comforts and enjoyment 's in the otherwise harsh lifestyle of war in south vietnam .
