  why call it raisin bread ? 
  are there just none visible in that photo ? 
  hey , 10k of wasted time is not that bad compared to many . . 
  ^ ^ ^ including ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ dammit, 
  looks really nice , surface raisins or no . . 
  i really love zagreb too , just a really nice city . 
  great value , great food , nice people , lovely architecture , good museums and so on ( as you mention elsewhere ) and heaps of really cool ~ ~ like ~ ~ little bars ( eg the little bacchus grotto down near the railway station ) . 
  just in case anyone is n't certain which country is actually more dangerous , here is a comparison of us vs croat crime : http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/croatia/united-states/crime, 
   total crimes :, 
   croatia : 101,853 ranked 45th . 
   usa 11.88 million ranked 1st . 
  117 times more than croatia, 
  edit : for those who do n't know , croatia 's population is about 4.5 m , or roughly 1/70 of the us , making the 117x greater number of crimes in the states equate to a significantly higher rate . 
  dubrovnik is king 's landing - as is made immediately apparent upon visiting the old town by the number of tour guides dressed up in got style costumes . . 
  that particular statistic seems to be an absolute , but almost all the others included in the comparison are based on rates rather than absolute numbers . 
  perhaps more useful :, 
   violent crime/murder rate per million people :, 
   croatia : 14.03 ranked 67th . 
   usa : 42.01 ranked 43th . 
  3 times more than croatia, 
  should n't use exceptions to control logic . . 
  yeah , i do n't doubt it . 
  that whole thread is a goldmine of sas , a number of people seemed to think croatia dangerous , requiring supreme vigilance from any who dare visit . 
  that does n't tally with my experiences whatsoever , i have never felt remotely threatened in croatia and indeed feel much more relaxed in zagreb or split than i did in rome or athens , particularly wrt pickpockets ( which they seem to consider a particular problem . . ), 
  it is , yes . 
  often the ruined dwellings in croatia/bih are owned by serbs who left during the war and have n't returned ( vice versa in republika srpska , and i guess serbia . . ), 
  that is how i always feel . 
  i have cousins in bol ( on brac ) so have been a few times now , spending a few days in split and then somewhere else in croatia or bih each time . 
  quite literally nowhere in either country have i ever felt uncomfortable , as in fearing for my personal safety or the security of my property . 
  of course i stay aware of my surroundings ( exactly as i do here , in western australia ) , but it 's nothing like athens or rome , let alone bloody naples . 
  i never felt unsafe in any of those cities either , but i did take my wallet out of my back pocket and in naples into a pouch thing under my armpit . 
  needless to say i have never remotely considered any such precaution anywhere in hr/bih . 
  i 'm coming back this year ( making three in a row ) and ca n't wait . 
  that was why this struck me as so sas worthy , especially with the `` as an american '' coupled with some ignorant shit format ha ha ha . 
  frankly i find the us more scary as a tourist , and have no intention of going back there ( although the danger is n't the main reason tbf ) . 
  i actually consider myself a zionist , in that i support israel 's continued existence , self-determination and security as a place where the jewish people may have a home . 
  israel has done a lot , both good and bad , since the individuals to whom i previously referred , and my discomfort at some of their attitudes and actions does not mean i hate either all zionist jews or modern zionists . 
  please do n't keep trying hard to make five from two plus two . 
  there is no need , there is enough to debate without flights of fancy . 
  right , but even then croatia would be south central europe , not south eastern . 
  it is right next to italy , separated only by the adriatic . 
  saying south-xx europe is not the designation the eu uses for croatia 's subregion , and geographically it is as i described above . 
  culturally it is closer to western or central european imo , not least in its tradition catholicism . 
  ukraine is south eastern europe . 
  that link needs the `` www . '', 
  removed to work there . . 
  tbqh this looks * much * better than many '' [ i ate ] fish & chips from < insert us restaurant in city x  '' posts so-called fish n ' chips manages to . 
  much , much better . . 
  they mean spayed i think . 
  not `` naughty kitty gets the spade '' . . 
  great picture !, 
  does make me think of the beach low-pass in catch-22 though , which did not end well at all !, 
  what makes you think vung tau ? 
  skyraiders were based at both nha trang and da nang , both of which were actually practically on the beach . 
  both nha trang and da nang also have islands across from the beach too , and while beaches change and i have n't swum at every vung tau beach this sand looks wider than i recall from the back beach at vt at least . 
  i have only been as a tourist , so the beaches could have changed a lot between when i went and when the pic was taken . 
  really love the photo wherever it was taken . 
  perfect weekend to bring it up though !, 
  looking at this considering just abbott 's action ( without even considering his awful politics , either personal or as exemplar of the hard-right lnp faction ) one must conclude what a fucking whiteanting cunt . 
  this is probably worse than rudd 's backstabbing gillard as this must be presumed to be motivated by pure malice and ongoing resentment at his deposal ; abbott has the proverbial snowball 's chance of ever leading again , while rudd was at least actively manoeuvring within the alp . 
  whether a libs supporter or not it 's hard to see how anyone could support tones himself . 
  sour grapes does n't come close as a descriptor . 
  so iyho political prisoners engaged in nonviolent resistance are `` terrorists '' . . 
  i have no doubt you will shortly be anointed with copious upvotes for that one . 
  seems to me as a reasonable , unbiased and uninvolved individual that palestinians get called terrorists and violently assaulted by pro-israelis , the regime , idf stormtroopers ( and all the other usual gang of rogues who support the criminals i just mentioned ) no matter whether they act violently or nonviolently themselves . 
  and pro-israelis wonder why the palestinians resort to violence . . 
  no , i actually mentioned above i am unbiased . . 
  i beg to differ . 
  nope , it 's perfectly natural . 
  from your quote :, 
    *** israel said ***, 
  [ emphasis my own ], 
  the israeli regime is obviously going to place its spin on what is happening , precisely as i outlined above . 
  such nonviolent protests rank among israelis ' worst nightmares , [ as many commentators have noted ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/05/israel_and_palestine_0 ) because they remove the figleaf of `` self-defence '' that israel uses to justify it 's brutal colonialist project 's egregiously violent character . 
  that is one interpretation of history , albeit not the generally accepted version ( outside the israeli and us extreme right wing ) . 
  i do n't hate jews , i think they are cool , 
  i do n't hate israel either ftr , i would just like to see an end to the conflict . 
  i think it 's true the interests of both groups align more than they diverge , other than in the messed up minds of both sides ' extremists . 
  tarring nonviolent protesters with the terrorism brush seems to me to be counterproductive though , and sadly was both the official response cited in the article *** and *** the first comment . . 
  prisoners can - and do - riot too , being in prison does not mandate nonviolent resistance . 
  some of the prisoners are , i am quite sure , terrorists by any definition ; however , many palestinians are detained under `` administrative detention '' indefinitely without trial - these individuals may or may not have been involved in violent resistance , but western democracies ' legal systems are founded on the concept of presumption of innocence and so , in the absence of a trial , we ( in such nations ) are bound to extend the benefit of the doubt . . 
  incidentally , supporting nonviolent protests in the west bank were also reportedly met with violence from israeli security forces . 
  in any case i personally believe that nonviolent protest/resistance is an immeasurably better path and should be supported rather than any violence . 
  my exact first thought !, 
  this sub has now completely jumped the shark , and surely *** must *** now be renamed r/housingbubblecirclejerk . . 
  is it really necessary to talk about it in every single thread though ? 
  tbqh it comes across as monomania at this point . 
  agreed . 
  as a backpacker his budget might not stretch to a * decent * vintage grange , so i would probably suggest a henschke `` hill of grace '' instead . . 
  being a wanker is n't grounds for asylum , you 'll just have to keep taking your chances in seppostan mate . 
   there 's nothing like the united states . 
  thank fuck . . 
  your egoism is misplaced , it 's not * just * you who are guilty of hijacking this sub , nor of suffering from an ( i would say ) unhealthy obsession with what you and others respectively do n't or do possess . . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion . 
  i 'm not the only person to have noted this issue here though , and the very nature of a circlejerk makes it self perpetuating in the exact manner you choose to view as vindication . . 
  what did * this * thread * really * have to do with * housing * though ? 
  yes , i knew that . 
  why is this flaired `` political satire '' ? 
  yeah , coz it would have been open to anyone who just wanted a round , not just skilled club coaches , right ? 
  wow , so did i only a couple of months ago . .
