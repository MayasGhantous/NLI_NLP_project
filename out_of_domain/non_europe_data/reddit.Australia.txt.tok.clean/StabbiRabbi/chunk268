   `` not having a partner and effectively a double salary also makes it harder to borrow money from the bank to allow me to buy a place that i would be truly happy with , '' he says . 
  if he is n't * truly happy * then why should he pay for shit ? 
  this is the correct answer . 
  original thanks to u/carranddrone . . 
  i think the guy you replied to was ( trying ) to make a funny at the expense of disabled people . 
   i did not kidnap three little boys in 1994 !, 
  they were n't that little , they came willingly and it was a different time, 
  * none of those * sound like good excuses to me . . 
  thanks for the reference , i knew from abc he had done this a cop , but did n't know the details . 
  what a piece of shit . 
  i have heard it plenty , often as '' [ let 's do an ] do a harry holt '' , or even just `` an harry '' . 
  ca n't use internet . . hnnnnnng . . must . . get . . to . . reddit . . ca n't . . hnnnnng . . miss . . opportunity . . to . . have . . a. . fucking . . cry . . hnnnnnnnnnnnnng, 
  oh you !, 
  tbf he 's not * entirely * wrong as my work does pay for my ipad data , though i use that less than either my phone or my home connexion . 
  that 's the thing though - if one internet is slow then just use a different connexion . 
  i find it impossible to believe that anyone in this day and age has less than two options , with most - like me ( with telstra 4g , optus 4g and fttp 100/100 nbn , as well as work internet 08:15 -16:15 ) - having three/four alternatives . 
  4g is quite acceptable for most use cases . 
  this morning something weird was happening with my ipad and reddit , but gaf ? 
  nope , i did n't have to sob my little heart out over it : i just changed devices ffs . 
  my advice to op is to do the same . 
   you trash other people 's countries but when people ask where you 're from you scurry away for fear someone will criticize your country . 
  u/desalvo23 literally just told you where he is from in the comment you replied to . 
  looks like us education system is as strong as us morals . . 
  i am from australia , in case you feel like tickling my funny bone with what you think of my country . 
  class is a necessary social construct , but only seems to be solely ( or even primarily ) about money for those from the lower social orders . 
  even if someone acquires an investment property ( or ten ) they do not magically escape the bounds of their position in society . 
  likewise , one may lose one 's fortune and yet not become an insta-pleb . 
  that would be a very odd interpretation of the law which was entirely reliant on bullshit semantics though , right ? 
  surely israel would never sink to playing such games ? 
  the idf does also attack the saa . 
  do n't forget that both hezb and the saa are fighting israel 's allies isis and aq . 
  yes , those former idf servicemen and women are definitely enemies of israel . . 
  not a spoon , but i like to try new sauces on celery - it forms an ideal scoop and is pretty flavour neutral itself . 
  a single person 's opinion does not constitute `` proof '' . 
  the friendly relations between the israeli regime and isis were mentioned literally this week by israeli regime figure and former defence minister , moshe ya\u2019alon . 
  say what one will about the israeli regime , i find it hard to believe they are complete idiots to the point the leaders are unaware of the `` states '' they have relationships with . . 
  so scarcely either old news or conspiracy theory . 
   whether people would `` welcome '' a housing crash is probably the wrong question . 
  whether it is the `` wrong question '' or not , that was what was asked and answered . . 
  another wicked act by a wicked regime , but neither more nor less than we have come to expect from the israelis , sadly . 
  bryce canyon is amazing , such a beautiful place . 
  i would imagine it shall stay as it is , after all the symbology is now largely historical and our history shall not change . 
  you simply *** must *** check out the great sydney housing bubble if you 're in the vicinity , it 's quite fantastic and , as we are constantly informed , wo n't be around for ever !, 
  makes it too damn easy to put on weight , what with all the delicious cuisine that comes along with different cultures . 
  so civilian airports are military targets now ? 
  i hope hamas are n't reading this , i really do . . 
  i think the israeli interpretation of `` transfer '' is the redefinition of common usage tbqh . 
  great , good to hear : could you post your proof for our elucidation though please ? 
  evidently you have access to the intelligence used as i am sure nobody on reddit would just mindlessly parrot the israeli propaganda machine 's excuses unquestioningly , would they ( you ) ? . 
  what gives israel the right to keep attacking anyone anyway , particularly as there is no conflict between either assad or hezb and israel ? 
  if the grown-ups ' countries just mindlessly lashed out at every potential threat that made us scared the cold war would have gone hot very quickly, 
   the first is that he finally *** proves *** what i have always known, 
  [ emphasis my own . ], 
  smh . . 
  moshe ya'alon 's comments are what i am referring to here , as widely reported this week . 
  allies of convenience , i am simply commenting based on moshe ya'alon 's interesting remarks this week . 
  i do n't think israel supports isis or aq 's strategic , big picture goals obviously , but at a tactical level there is certainly a strong alignment . 
  i live in perth and still get unsolicited job offers . . 
  i do n't see how any of those makes someone a fuckwit tbqh . 
  people are free to wear or carry whatever clothes and accessories they like ; she probably would n't agree with your sartorial choices either , but i doubt she looked at you and thought `` what a fuckwit '' because you lacked a prada bag ( she probably did n't notice you at all tbqh ) . 
  running shoes with business wear is just practical - her job probably mandates business wear , but walking long distances in heels is just dumb . 
  and wtf is wrong with doing makeup on the train ? 
  in a car , sure , that 's fucked , but a train ? 
  the only issue i can see is * perhaps * bag on seat , but even that is predicated entirely on there being no other seats free . 
  i very much doubt anyone who shares my qualifications and experience is unemployed unless they actively want to be . 
  logic would suggest those struggling to find work to acquire the qualifications/knowledge in demand from employers . 
  i do n't mean to sound unsympathetic as i know the market here * is * tough , and i know how much that sucks ( from past personal experience ) . 
  i definitely did n't mean to sound like i was rubbing your face in it or anything ( if i did give that impression . . ) , but was just reporting my recent personal experiences also in perth . 
  the market here does seem to be picking up a little , hopefully that is not just in my industry . 
  good luck mate , i do hope you find a job soon . 
  israel has a long and dark history of unilateral military action , disregard for other nations ' sovereignty ( even their declared allies - eg usa , australia ) and politically motivated slaughter of innocents ( both directly by way of iaf terror bombing and via proxies such as the phalangists in lebanon ) ; given the idf primarily uses us weapons ( even stealing from us stockpiles when chewing through the freebies too fast ) i very much doubt the planners gaf about `` wasting resources '' either . 
  how is the onus on proving the negative , when unilateral israeli violence is the active element in this scenario ? 
  it 's an horrible position to be in , and very demoralising i know , but keep your chin up . 
  you will find a job mate , even if it take a bit longer than it ought . 
  it 's not always an option i know , but have you considered study , or even teaching yourself ? 
  when i graduated uni was a pretty slow time , so i started work by starting a business with another guy which i used to gain experience . 
  ( this is as a software dev - a role that has subsequently served me well in every regard . ), 
  as i said though , the mood does seem to be lightening here a bit , albeit slowly . 
  i have noticed more job ads in my seek digests , which is anecdotal and speaks directly only to my role , but nonetheless indicates things are stirring . 
  i also know of projects starting up and so on , so hopefully the market generally will improve . 
  anyway , do n't give up mate , you will get there !, 
  how are these kids going to cope with real life if they ca n't cope with the books one reads in fucking high school ? 
  stress can be highly debilitating in and of itself , especially this type of stress ( ie employment/career related ) which triggers existential angst in us all . 
  i have been in your spot , at much the same age , and remember it well , although not fondly . 
  late-20s is when many of us start questioning our direction and self-doubt often creeps in , which naturally results in anxiety , which makes one stress more , which makes applying oneself harder and so on in a vicious cycle . 
  all i can say is i am sure you will pull through , it is something many of us go through ( though i know that is cold comfort when you are dealing with it ) and 99 % of us come out the other side intact . 
  let me say though that 28 is still young and you have time to shape your career !, 
  i do n't think there is much games dev work here , although there is definitely some . 
  ( i have met guys doing it . . ), 
  one of my colleagues studied it at murdoch , but found no games job ; however , he * did * find a good job he enjoys enough to have stuck with for three years straight thus far using the programming skills learnt in the course of his degree . 
  personally i really enjoy software development and would encourage anyone who is interested to pursue the career . 
  it is work i find intrinsically satisfying , and endlessly interesting . 
  it also does n't have any moral ambiguity about it , as many professions seem to ( unless you are working on something specifically morally dubious ofc ) . 
  i missed where you mentioned bankruptcy , but yeah - i would say avoid it if at all possible !, 
  if you do want to study then probably waiting till you have resources ( both financial and personal - eg morale ) to support yourself through it , as it does require application and focus . 
   so it is easy to see what the book is about , and if my daughter should read it at age 10 , or a few years later when she can better understand what suicide is . 
  so your comment was not talking about the same thing as the article ? 
  ok then . 
  to be quite clear , this is talking about 17 year old kids - not ten year olds . 
  if these sses ca n't cope with these ideas on the cusp of leaving school and are then cosseted yet further they are in for a tough time when life does eventually pierce the cotton wool .
