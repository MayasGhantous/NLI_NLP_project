  let me rephrase then : israel shared military technology of us origin with countries that it is banned to share such technology with as they are competitors for influence in different regions of the world and potential future adversaries , such as russia and china . 
  better ? 
  it just always awards judgement for the government position/interest because its members ' consciences and judgement - coincidentally - always tell them that those are the * right * decisions from a moral and legal standpoint ?

  i 'll just quote my own reply to another commenter :,

  that 's open to debate certainly , but he seems happy to live in australia and identify as an aussie ... ( cough ) : /, 
  ok , , not sorry ? 
  is that better ? 
  of course we are not in possession of * all * the facts , but we are n't completely in the dark anyway . 
  western media is much more open than the israeli press ; these issues have been reported on for many , many years . 
  what we do know about is more than enough to be certain such exchanges of sensitive technologies with countries they should not have * have * definitely occurred . 
  edit : btw , saying :, 
   the reason why the lavi 's plans were sold to the chinese 20 or so years after its development is that the american publicly ( i.e. 
  to the knesset i guess ) told israel they were going to withhold monetary support if the lavi was to be produced according to plan, 
  is no justification for essentially selling out an ally , certainly acting against their interests . 
  what was it , some kind of tantrum thrown because the knesset did not get its way , despite the billions of dollars of us funding , the military supplies , technology transfer and technology purchases for and by the us govt ? 
  how is that any kind of justification ? 
  are dwarf hamsters a breed or like tyrions of the pet world ? 
  either way he 's adorable and tough , just like tyrion . 
  hopefully better behaved though . 
  a new pair of sunglasses i guess . 
  i lost mine and do n't want a new pair enough to drop the necessary $ 400 right now ( i live in australia - * everything * is fucking expensive ! ) . 
  lucky for me we 're in autumn ( our autumn equinox was last saturday ) , but i guess you 're probably in the northern hemisphere and hence in spring : summer 's on its way man !, 
  reading widely : books , magazines , journals , blogs , fiction , current affairs , news , history , science , technical information - whatever . 
  and commenting in subs where you can find a healthy debate around what you learn , eg / r/worldnews will allow you to sharpen your debating skills , technical/science/history subs will also allow you to stretch your wings in those areas !, 
  you 're luckier than me then , 
  sorry i could n't help , but i 'm glad up you do n't need the sunnies , hope you enjoyed australia and that you have a good birthday . 
  books are always my fallback if i 'm really desperate ... not exciting , but * always * welcome for me ... 
  nah , for real man : you ca n't be * serious * with that comment ? 
  it 's got to be a joke , surely ? 
  nobody actually believes that kind of crap except perhaps israeli propagandists who totally drank their own kool-aid !, 
  lol , i thought you 'd like that !, 
  atm the al quds force is used for fighting isis ... 
  there really cool - i had been entirely ignorant before your post.til . 
  thank you , 
  i do try to educate with my silly little posts , it 's great to get feedback that people * are * learning !, 
  the truth is out there for those who care to look and i just happen to enjoy reading widely so i feel it 's kind of a duty . 
  who are also fighting isis ... 
  both groups were recently taken off the us terrorist threat list in fact , the story was on / r/worldnews just a few days ago . 
  hezbollah actually build schools and run other social programs as well as their defensive role in southern lebanon ; they are a de facto government in the region and much more than just a fighting force . 
  woah , steady on mate . 
  i * never * deny israel 's right to exist , say * anything * about `` the jews '' or support groups like hamas and their terrorist attacks on israeli civilians . 
  if you read my posts i only ever criticise certain actions and policies of the current israeli government not israel per se and definitely not the israeli people . 
  in fact i have a massive amount of empathy for the israeli people who are almost as much victims of cunts like netanyahu as the palestinians - i pity the israeli people too !, 
  they are denied peace and forced to live under the odium of world opinion that the extreme right-wing nationalist government that * most of them did n't even vote for * generates by its oppression of the palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories . 
  i never say anything that is n't objectively true either , although some of it may be difficult reading for somebody who is a victim of the israeli government 's internal propaganda and misinformation machine and who has never been exposed to certain realities , leading to a very entrenched , skewed world view that some of the things i write about must make feel very confrontational as facts that disturb their inner sense of self-righteousness . 
  ultimately i always argue for a balanced and fair , viable two-state solution under which both israelis and palestinians can live well in peace and prosperity . 
  is that so terrible ? 
  i personally am a completely uninvested wasp australian !, 
  i have no inherent bias other than that created by an inherently australian sense of fair play making me fight the tidal wave of hate speech , propaganda and lies that floods / r/worldnews from proponents of the israeli extreme right wing . 
  shalom my friend . 
  when they 're * that * cute a little lack of intelligence is surely compensated for by their owner 's protective instincts , 
  wtf ? 
  have you not been monitoring events in europe as cold war style brinkmanship is being played out again between nato and russia ? 
  as for the chinese , as i have explained repeatedly they are a competing power that may one day present a military threat and that the american military is currently repositioning itself to be able to contain as their military capability grows year on year as does their `` assertiveness '' regarding territorial disputes with almost every us ally in the region . 
  you are resorting to literalism and semantics when you say neither country is an `` enemy '' ; both a certainly viewed as threats and any american who passes secrets to them would be tried for treason . 
  make of that what you will . 
  that 's true , but the fact remains relations between iran and the west have been steadily warming , to the point they have been removed the terrorist threat list published by us defence analysts . 
  closer engagement and cooperation with them as is currently being developed by the talks that are underway will only improve relations further and make them even less of a `` threat '' . 
  the axis-of-evil days are over and iran is no longer a belligerent enemy of the west . 
  brb , going to google syrian hamster ( again i was ignorant of their existence until you just told me ! ), 
  edit : ok , they are frickin ' adorable too !, 
  you should definitely post a picture of him too , or better still the pair of them ( assuming they get along of course ! ), 
  it 's probably just simple d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu man ; do n't read too much into it . 
  hey i do n't remember writing about a comic book villain come to life , but it * sounds * like something i 'd write and i comment so much it 's perfectly possible i used that phrase and have since forgotten about it !, 
  do n't sweat it man , 
  maybe i 'm just an optimist that tries to see and portray the good in people too much , but my dad regularly travels to iran ( and kurdistan as well as formerly , though sadly not anymore due to the security situation , libya ) on business ( yep , oil and gas exploration ) and loves the country and its people . 
  ordinary iranians are * not * their fanatical leaders any more than ordinary israelis are not netanyahu or libermann or ordinary palestinians the hamas leadership !, 
  the way , imo , to weaken and ultimately undermine such extremist leaderships as the three mentioned above is to allow the general population to live peacefully and in prosperity so as to undermine the extremists hold on power ... 
  i thought the pakistanis were more of a problem in afghanistan . 
  i know the irgc had been a problem in iraq about ten years ago when they supplied the mahdi army and other shiite militias , but was unaware of any meddling in afghanistan beyond their regular and deadly border battles with drug gangs who often are taliban related . 
  he looks so innocent ... 
  i suspected hamsters are territorial from some distant memory of being told that which is why i said `` if they get along '' , but you just confirmed that for me . 
  til x3 , 
  ha ha , not just a houdini , but a player too !, 
  sounds like they have heaps of character ... 
  as i explain elsewhere about iran i try to defend people not their extremist leaders whether that 's israelis living under the international odium and domestic fear that likud/netanyahu/libermann generate , the palestinian people who are oppressed by the frankly evil hamas , the iranians who live under the jackboot of the islamic republic or in this case the poverty struck inhabitants of southern lebanon who lack an effective national government and have only hezbollah to provide social and governmental services ( eg schools , healthcare centres ) . 
  i do * not * excuse them their acts of terror or conduct in other ways , especially towards israel as it must be said they have displayed no direct , actioned animus towards america in about 30 yrs since the beirut bombings ... 
  in fact i do 100 % remember talking about cartoon villains in relation to hamas in / r/worldnews within the last month or so ( my account is barely three months old ... ) , which would certainly be enough to trigger d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu man . 
  i was going to edit my original comment when i saw your reply . 
  no worries man !, 
  ok so i should perhaps remove the israelis from my list - after all they 're the only ones who actually voted their leaders in !, 
  ( even if most of them did n't vote for netanyahu . ), 
  the fall of communism shows there is nothing more likely to end an autocratic dictatorship ( or theocratic dictatorship by extension ) than opening up access to the rest of the world !, 
  why do you think the ccp ( chinese communist party ) have relaxed the economic constraints , but continue to enforce strict social controls * especially * over the internet ? 
  as i understand it iran and the taliban are anathema to each other , the taliban being salafist/wahhabi sunnis and the iranians shia . 
  they may allow hazara and other shiite fighters through ; however , these fighters are generally part of the former northern alliance that has always cooperated with the west as the largely pashtun , sunni taliban are their common enemy . 
  i would actually imagine that corruption flows the other way , with iranian officials being bribed by afghan drug smuggling gangs if anything .
