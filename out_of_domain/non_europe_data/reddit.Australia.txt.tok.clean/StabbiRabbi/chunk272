  2/3 of which were initiated by the zionist/israeli forces . . 
  this 18th fbg scheme is my favourite mustang livery . 
  one tiny detail you might consider adding is the oil guard fitted to f-51ds by the time korea rolled around : https://i.imgur.com/g71hmyr.jpg, 
  '48 was inevitable result of zionist aggression the previous year , '67 was a sneak attack of the most disgusting kind - if you count '67 as not started by the israelis then '73 was started by israel coz this is like opposite world or some shit dude . 
   perhaps they will have a police like booze bus outside centrelink . 
  actually a very good idea , you should suggest it to your local mp , though obviously it 's a druggo bus which is specifically required here . 
  and * this * \\ ^ is exactly why unis need to be more selective wrt whom they accept . . 
  that * would * result in an huge drop in the number of active jobseekers in one fell swoop though . . 
  it would balance out though , as there would be new prison jobs . . 
  well , i was thinking more of the former centrelink workers , but sure , after a 6-12mo rehabilitation & training period , i guess the former dole bludgers could be found work in the prisons . . 
  have you tried coffee bags ? 
  for the time/effort they require they are not * too * bad , albeit not as nice as a caf\u00e9 made coffee of course . 
  when i make one i generally chuck two bags in instead of one , which helps a bit . 
  neglect ? 
  there has been plenty of attention paid to the kiwis living here by the government recently . 
  you know that happens , do n't you ? 
  it 's very hard to test for active drugs so they test metabolites in urine , which remain for some time following use . 
  people who smoke weed regularly may find themselves in trouble for weed smoked weeks earlier , and indeed this happens frequently . 
  i always upvote rotties , they are such great dogs . 
  i used to have a mother and daughter , though both have now passed and i now live in an apartment which effectively precludes another dog for the time being ; they were the best . 
  they are n't as good as proper coffee , but they shit all over instant and are * very * convenient , which makes them great for just rolling out of bed and getting that first , essential caffeine hit . 
  like u/bloodymentalist , i buy the robert timms ones . 
  i always have some in the cupboard even though i generally buy caf\u00e9 coffee ( being lucky enough to have a coffee place < 200m from my door which opens at 6:30 am ) as they are ideal for the times i really need a coffee , but do n't have time for a made cup/caf \u00e9s are shut . 
  for reference , i will drink tea rather than instant if that 's all that 's available . 
  in what world is * anyone * earning $ 18kpa able to afford a house ? 
  that 's not a full-time wage . 
  as your earnings increase so shall your ability to save . . 
  that 's great to hear expressed by an israeli , especially here where so many will refuse to give an inch or acknowledge anything positive about `` the other side '' . 
  pro-palestine does not necessarily mean anti-israel , and it 's a shame so many insist on that false dichotomy . 
  next century they will get around to human ambulances . 
  after they build flushing toilets for cows first though , of course . 
  i do n't get it ? 
  my first job was at kfc , where one of my colleagues was a mentally disabled bloke . 
  one day he was down on his hands and knees cleaning around the bottom of the chip fryers ( do n't know why he was down there . . ) when he bumped the fryer , spilling hot oil out of it and onto him . 
  the scream was blood-curdling , poor guy must have been in so much pain . 
  he was luckily wearing his visor thing which shielded his face to a large extent , but it was still an horrific event to witness . 
  the guy in this article must have endured significantly more pain and certainly suffered more serious injury . 
  frankly , having heard that scream , neither $ 15k compo nor $ 100k fine is remotely adequate . 
  you should be grateful , take the opportunity and flee !, 
  yeah , holy fuck : you could literally cut the irony inherent in this particular bit of sas with a knife . . 
  if you 're interested and do n't mind ( well-researched ) historical fiction , robert graves ( author of the classic novels * i , claudius * & * claudius the god * about the julio-claudia emperor claudius ) wrote an excellent novel about belisarius , * [ count belisarius ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/count_belisarius ) * you may well find interesting . 
  i certainly enjoyed it when i read it . 
  domestic i think you can , depending on what ticket you bought . 
  check your booking details , or ring qantas . 
  i 'm in two minds about this , but i do n't necessarily agree this is cruelty per se : imo the extended wait period for young cunts ( as annoying as those fucks are . . ) was worse as this is predicated on people having their own money whilst the youth had no such cushion . 
  personally , were i to be made redundant ( hopefully the only way i would lose my job . . ) and receive a redundancy payout i would be disinclined to sign on anyway , if only to avoid the bullshit like work for the dole . 
  however , as i was typing this i thought about it , and given i pay my taxes and am happy for those in need to receive welfare i have to ask why would i not enjoy what benefits it offers when i was in need ? 
  certainly the system is overburdened and people ought to pay their own way when they are able , but is placing someone under huge financial pressure as they chew through savings * really * a net gain for our society ? 
  be nice , be considerate and pay attention to the things that are important to them . 
  a regular phone call can mean more than a gift , it 's making time for people that is often the best way of expressing one 's affection . 
  that 's fucked mate , i 'm sad that happened to you . 
  those cunts probably mouth off about how `` you terrorists '' ( in their vile terms ) do n't want to integrate too !, 
  how much support would there be for a formalised class system here , as per the classical roman model ( as opposed to say the caste system beloved of hindooism . . ) ? 
  it 's gross breathing in all that greasy steam too . 
  that 's not a problem on a par with the safety issues , but i have never forgotten that shit . . 
  well , yes , but it 's not enshrined in law at the moment , unfortunately , and does not provide anyone with the comfort of knowing exactly their place . 
  ( eg to you i am perhaps `` them '' while you are `` us '' , but vice versa for me . ), 
  i was thinking along the lines of patricians , equestrians and plebs ( with updated names ) , differentiated by property qualifications as well as family antecedents , each class having appropriate rights and responsibilities for their means and needs ( financial of course , but also intellectual/moral/etc ) : in this way those unequipped for involvement in public life can be freed of that burden , while those who are best suited may be allowed free reign , as would naturally be best for everybody . 
  were such a system in place we would not , for example , have pauline hanson in parliament . . 
  great picture of perhaps the most iconic usn scheme of the vietnam war !, 
  never seen this particular picture before , it provides excellent detail . 
  was n't it that the octavii were plebs , but raised to patrician status before `` the '' octavian became augustus ? 
  the early empire is the model i had in mind , though of course i do think we would need to update aspects of the system to suit our society today . 
  ( eg allowing women independent status without requiring a guardian so bishop would be ok without a doubt , as would wong ideally . . ), 
  stupid laws . . 
  i had never heard of chilli ponzu before , but now i know of it i must find some ; unfortunately the link you provided returned a dns error though , so i was hoping you could perhaps fix it or repost ? 
  by sriracha i guess you mean huy fong 's version ? 
  one of my current favourites is a local ( western australia ) sriracha which is a sriracha style sauce , but available in hotter varieties and with a `` better '' ( in quotes as better is obviously subjective . . ) flavour . 
  the specific sauce i have is [ dingo hot sauce ] ( https://www.facebook.com/dingosauceco/ ) 's widow maker sriracha , but you may find a similar product local to you . 
  i also like sambla oelek , as others have mentioned , and find asian shops carry a range of different brands/styles - mine is all in vietnamese though so i ca n't give you a brand sorry . 
  sadly i think chomsky is correct as far as israeli intentions go , exactly as bennett detailed this week . 
  certainly there was no apology in what he said , and i think the sole difference between his position and that of the rest of the regime 's is his unvarnished honesty . 
  right now in r/israel they are crowing over some report that hamas does still want to destroy israel and discussing how the message hamas presents to the west differs from the message they present to the arab world ; i fail to see how they are * any * different in that regard . 
  ( with the exception of bennett and his cohort . . ), 
  it 's important to discuss this and raise awareness lest the blandishments of the `` moderate '' regime members allow the israeli project advance too far . 
  sanctions are , i honestly believe , the only way israel will ever be diverted from this path and i find it incredibly frustrating that the west has not yet had the courage to defy israel and do the right thing . 
  the bubble top spitfires are the best looking of them all imo , though i think the later griffon engined marks have a slight edge over the mk ix in looks as they look a touch beefier and meaner . 
  this is a beautiful example though . 
  the israeli extreme right ( so the mainstream over there right now . . ) feverishly push this narrative of pogroms and shakira law in europe to deliberately try to scare european jews into emigrating to israel to help fulfil the zionist dream . 
  this guy has no doubt been told his very life is at risk so much that no matter what empirical evidence he is show he would never stop believing it sadly . 
  i may be wrong , but did n't british bubble canopies predate us designs ? 
  i am pretty sure the typhoon was in service long before the p-51d / p-47d which introduced the bubble on those types . 
  i just love how sleek the later spitfires look , though there is no spitfire which is not a beautiful plane !, 
  between the mg-3 and the camo design these guys * almost * look like wwii fallschirmj\u00e4ger ( or perhaps waffen ss ) . 
  the mg-42 / mg-3 design is remarkable for still being in service today with so few changes from the wwii original ( other than round it 's chambered for ) . 
  idk how or why , but i just clicked it again and no worries . . 
  thx for replying and promoting me to try it again !, 
  so i am guessing that 's your site/shop ? 
  if so , do you post internationally ? 
  we put a ring of petrol around the nest , then pour more down the entrances . 
  try this with your house , it should work just fine . 
  same in my country . 
  bennett , shaked et al are pretty fucking extreme imo , and are members not just of the knesset , but key members of netanyahu 's inner `` security cabinet '' !, 
  they are key regime figures . . 
  netanyahu is himself pretty extreme by global standards . 
  i meant in terms of politics , of course not all israeli individuals are extreme and i am sorry if it sounded like that 's what i meant . 
  it is strictly *** verboten *** to make jokes in r/australia , except the smashed avo joke . 
  *** any *** attempt to do so will be severely punished with heavy downvoting !, 
  poor little muppets , the blows keep coming , do n't they ? 
  coming from australia , the us * democrats * seems pretty right wing to me , so i think perhaps our views of what is right and what is hard right differ .
