  very simple , but so many people i have worked with just keep adding loc until what they are working on does what it 's meant to with little regard for design principles or future maintenance . 
  lucky the car behind did n't wheel him !, 
  just finished fighting one on my balcony . 
  do n't often see huge scary ones like that one though - more often you see tiny , highly venomous ones . 
  australians wants her in court . 
  not dead . 
  this is a shame , ludlum was alright both as a pollie ( especially next to his peers . . ) and as a person ( based off the social events he and i both attended ) ; however , the insidious influence of kiwis really can not be allowed to impact aussie sovereignty so i must , albeit regretfully , call this as being the correct course of action . 
  if kiwis are given a voice the danger is , of course , that they will work tirelessly ( oh the irony . . ) to reenable their compatriots ' access to our social security net which they covet so passionately ( as evidenced by that muppet always bleating in this sub about how hard some by kiwis are here , despite all the advantages kiwis uniquely receive here ! ), 
  the great danger with ludlum having done the righty is some alp union thug getting in in his place if people vote for some labor cunt instead of continuing to vote greens ( stupid people , though that is a given considering we are talking `` people who might consider voting labor '' . . ), 
  another day in qld . . 
  at what point do we finally see reason and expel the state from the federation ? 
  given that sentence , i would suggest you are also called bogan due to your speech patterns . . 
  maybe the solomon islands would ? 
  that would make a lot of sense ; certainly qld seems to have more in common with there than here . 
  either the solomons or png i guess . . 
  when will israel 's stormtroopers tire of murdering palestinians ? 
  doing so at one of islam 's holiest sites must make any human with a shred of morality and decency laugh at the zionist protestations that * they * do not seek war . 
  when will the litany of horrors committed in the name of ancient fairytales be stopped ? 
  the west must act !, 
  sanctions and war crimes trials are the only path possible at this point . 
  neutralised ? 
  nice weasel words there . 
  surely , no matter if the palestinians murdered this time did some little thing to provoke the illegal occupation forces or not , it is the illegal occupiers who are ultimately to blame ? 
  we in the west observe the situation in occupied palestine and this is very clear . 
   implies that israel is n't trying to steal a holy site from its traditional owners . . 
  smh . 
  the hypocrisy is sickening . 
  israeli should never even approach al-aqsa , and the fact they are willing to murder palestinians there speaks volumes about the sincerity of israeli bleating about wanting peace . 
  wait , is that meant to be a * pro-israel * argument ? 
  coz the illegal seizing of palestine following years of illegal immigration and terrorism under the banner of zionism is indubitably what started the fire . . 
  from the look of those fingers , the last thing she needs is * another * hsp . . 
   second best *** in the world ***, 
    wah wah wah , not good enough !, 
  well , tbf , `` some kind of scheming coconquerer '' kind of does describe israel to a tee !, 
  that that kind is the evil kind of scheming coconquerer barely needs staring at this point , though it 's still worth repeating . 
  i wonder if they can be employed against australia 's notorious industrial terrorism gangs ? 
  i 'd love to see how hard the cfmeitg is when it 's sas they 're trying to push around ha ha ha . . 
  in a way this is preferable to the usual israeli protestations that they * do n't * *** want *** to kill the palestinians ; at least it 's honest . 
  imagine sitting in your home when a 2000lb jdam dropped by an iaf f-16 drops through the roof , killing you and your entire extended family because someone else , who has nothing to do with you , fired an oversized firework . . 
  sometimes it seems israelis * want * to be perceived as evil oppressors , though why they desire this continues to baffle me . . 
  eu funded . . 
  smh . 
  and you seriously contend the idf has * never * dropped bombs on innocent families ? 
  * really * ? 
  you 're splitting hairs , much in the same way as the idf 's vicious stormtroopers split heads . . 
  except the idf , always spies if not stormtroopers at this exact point in time . . 
  no unit 504 , duvdevan , yamas ? 
  you should suggest that statement to illustrate the meaning of `` disingenuous '' . . 
  you could probably earn something from a dictionary or whatever . 
  or do you simply mean the idf is irredeemably incompetent ? 
  you did n't have to specify this is from qld - we could all guess that . . 
  paying it back is what i do when i accrue debt . 
  have you considered trying that route ? 
  hot sauce , ( good ) fajita mix and blackened meat seasoning powder ( cajun , for tuna steak and etc ) are the things i buy from the local septic snacks shop . 
  how else would describe them ? 
  we may not agree with their methods all the time , but they * are * resistance to a brutal , neo-colonist , cryptofascist occupation no matter how you slice the pie . . 
  sounds like it 's time for the west to step up for our next me adventure . . 
  um , what about the whole colonisation in the first place ? 
  israel is *** not *** a cryptofascist regime . . 
  who gives a fuck ? 
  i bet it 's a catholic school . 
  op is a kiwi . . 
  typically eloquent ; i guess eventually defending the morally indefensible gets draining eventually , does it buddy ? 
  tbh * i 'd * personally expect labor to lie more , as is their wont . 
  well , nobody except the murderous idf stormtroopers who repeatedly commit these atrocities . . 
  or are the stormtroopers just unwilling puppets of their wicked masters , devoid of any agency of their own ? 
  it is quite clearly regime policy ; with so many such atrocities the line that the idf `` do n't want to commit the murderous acts they revel in '' or are simply incompetent rather than bloodthirsty are worn completely bare . 
  soldiers = illegal , oppressive regime thugs . 
  next superpower ~ ~ 2020 ~ ~ ~ ~ 2025 ~ ~ [ year of superpower status to be advised ], 
  i guess this make venezuela a sinking ship , no ? 
  even small victories over the evil regime currently run by the infamous netanyahu gang should be celebrated by all moral people the world over , despite our sadness at how so many innocent palestinians must be broken on the zionist imperialist wheel for moral as opposed to crushing military victories . 
  what ? 
  that 's hardly an edgy view even if it 's at odds with your personal opinion . 
   the constituents in his electerate litterally made this bed , now fucking lay in it you fucking cunts . 
  and see what happens when you get shitty internet ? 
  spelling like in the comment \\ ^, 
  who cares if some pleb can spell though ? 
  the real tragedy in this particular story is these are useful members of society who no doubt use * their * internet to work - not just play games or avoid physically attending classes . 
  shitty internet to shitty suburbs just reduces the efficacy of online scammers , but when productive members of society are negatively affected ( as we see here ) then yes , a review is necessary . 
   just because they are professionals who spent the best part of decade acquiring their professional skills and who undertake a vital role in our society does n't mean they can or should earn shitloads of money , certainly no more than i can get on the dole for playing computer games and making edgy comments about my betters on reddit, 
  there , that 's what you actually * meant * , is n't it ? 
  how did it used to work ? 
  as much as i dislike the riyadh regime , anything that reduces tensions between the muslim powers is to be applauded as it bodes well for western disengagement in the me 's endless conflicts , particularly as working together ksa and iran could much more effectively combat the running sore which must ultimately be blamed for most , if not all , of the fighting in the region . 
   narrative, 
  smh . 
  if the zionist movement had n't picked palestine as its `` homeland '' do you think gaza would be in the state it 's in ? 
  personally i do n't believe there would be even 1/10th the total conflict in the region overall , let alone within palestine . . 
  my personal experience would indicate things are n't quite as bleak as you seem to think ; certainly neither i nor my family are `` rich '' , but i * would * say we 're `` comfortable '' and i do n't feel i am being denied anything i might reasonably expect as a typical member of a western society . 
  that encompasses opportunities , experiences and possessions , all of which i am personally satisfied with my access to and enjoyment of . 
  perhaps i am some kind of lucky little snowflake , but i genuinely do n't see how so nor how my experience can be so at variance with that of most people , particularly given that my peers all seem to enjoy the same . . 
  fair enough , i can both see the validity in those points and 100 % agree completely that we do n't want to slide into a us style society . 
   you people, 
  you may perhaps wish to consider more carefully how you phrase things ; that makes you come across as being very racist . 
  what do you have against anglo-celt australians anyway that you seek to dehumanise us by throwing us into a collective bucket so dismissively ? 
  i am disinclined to respond to something thus phrased ; however , to be clear : not all jew are israeli and those who are n't can hardly be blamed for the colonialist horrors and generally vicious nature of that nation 's actions/philosophy/politics . 
  so no , not `` the jews '' . . 
  well that was odd , though i must admit entertaining . 
  may i ask * where * did it all come from though ? 
  also please do n't call me an anti-semite . 
  it is both offensive and utterly untrue .
