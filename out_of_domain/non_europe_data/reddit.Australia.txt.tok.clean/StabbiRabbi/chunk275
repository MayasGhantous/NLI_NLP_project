  moral disquietude at the crimes of the zionist project and the illegal regime run from occupied jaffa ( aka tel aviv ) scarcely means someone hate jews : it just means they possess morals . 
  i care for all jewish people , as i do every person - i just wish the israeli jews would abandon their amoral colonialism and cede control back to the indigenous population and stay as guests instead of bombing the crap out of them for wicked , venal purposes . 
  everything you just wrote is nonsense : you seem to mistake me for some cartoon `` anti-semite '' which primarily exists in the fevered imaginations of neurotic israelis with a persecution complex . 
  oh you 're such a dramatist !, 
  none of what you say is true , either about me or the circumstances in occupied palestine . 
  where does this stuff come from ?? 
  have you thought about trying to write comedy , the whole facts thing clearly is not your fort\u00e9 . 
  actually the jews as a people , although not all individuals , abrogated any meaningful connexion over *** two thousand years ago *** with their hilariously * stupid * efforts to dodge paying their share of the pax romana price with its entirely predictable result . . 
  then , as now , the attitude among jewish inhabitants of palestine seems to have been '' * anything * is better than * peace * !, 
  which is in and of itself a compelling argument as to why control should be returned to palestine 's indigenous people .

  israeli is a criminal entity itself . . 
  no , it 's not . 
  if israel was not absolutely guilty as charged he could simply go to a palestinian hospital . 
  sorry to disillusion you , but actually nobody wants to kill jews just because they are jews . 
  people with morals just want israelis to stop stealing land and massacring the innocent native people of palestine , but it 's not like jewish israelis need to consume human blood to survive , is it ? 
  ergo , wanting israelis to stop their wanton murder of palestinians can not be construed as wanting to kill those israelis . 
  stop the evil acts and the criticism of israel will stop , it really is that simple . 
  given the israeli regime 's longstanding penchant for extrajudicial killing do n't you think if the hospitals in unoccupied palestine had been left in a condition adequate for the treatment he requires he would rather not be treated by an israeli hospital ? 
  ideally as part of any peace settlement israel will have to pay huge repatriations , including the building of adequate health , education , security and etc infrastructure for the native people so cruelly displaced by herzog and his followers ' band of amoral alien ( to the region ) adventurers , but until that happy day israel has an obligation to provide such assistance as is required . 
  cede control back to the indigenous population and pay fair compensation for the years of oppression and there will be peace . 
  if the zionist movement had decided on another `` homeland '' then palestine would not be in such a dreadful situation , crushed under the israeli jackboot as it is . 
  well , yes , there is of course an historical connexion ; however , that is very ancient history and any meaningful link was severed by the utterly retarded decision to pick that ridiculous fight with the great imperator titus . . 
  he is one of my favourite roman emperors . 
  you should see his arch in rome : definitely my favourite ancient monument . 
  only in the sense we are all indigenous to africa because our common ancestors lived there millennia ago - that is a very exact analogy . 
  ah whataboutism , the favourite argument of those who know they are entirely in the wrong . 
  they boast and gloat ; yet cry like little girls when the native population fight back against the colonisers . . 
  ghoulish jerk filming revenge porn for evil israelis gloating over one of their national victim 's death and his family 's suffering . . 
  seems to me this was pretty much justified tbqh . 
  do you think i actually managed to justify it ? 
  i am glad i persuaded you !, 
  the ghoul * was * asking for it , was n't he ? 
  your terrorists are their freedom fighters , just as your own , venerated , irgun , stern gang , lehi and idf are considered terrorists by the rest of the world . . 
  what , when did i say that ? 
  the irgun/stern gang/lehi terrorists were significantly more brutal , bloodthirsty and murderous than the palestinians have ever managed to be ( despite their dreadful `` best '' efforts ) , while the idf have them all combined beat in terms of civilian casualties inflicted : do you thoroughly condemn those evil men as much as you condemn the palestinians ? 
  at least the palestinians did n't * start * the whole shitshow ffs . 
  no standards do n't change : it 's always `` oppressive cryptofascist neo-colonialist regime evil/innocent indigenous population perhaps misguided in certain actions , but easier to sympathise with '' . 
  i am a zionist myself you know ? 
  i just think israel should exist only within the originally defined borders and deplore the `` settlements '' . 
  sure am , as i shall be till israeli colonialism is gone . 
  talking about it is simply the right , moral thing to do . 
  for a view from outside your fishbowl ( try it , why not ? ), 
  read this article from a highly respected australian journalist and gain an understanding of the conflict from an unbiased outsider 's view : http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/balcony-over-jerusalem-man-in-the-middle-in-israel/news-story/8c6953121322776bf231af4bc45b90e3, 
  let me warn you though : learning the truth about what the side you 're on actually represents and how it is perceived outside the national narrative may be somewhat jarring for you . 
  well , tbf , some of the sporty chicks * are * hot af , i do n't see that as an an invalid measure of their value . 
   primarily associated with ethnic groups . 
  people like you make me sick . 
  what exactly do you take issue with , and how does my opinion impact the author of the piece ( a man i have never met . . ) ? 
  yeah , unions have done us all an huge service historically , but - in australia at least - they are irrevocably tainted by corruption , not to mention their habit of undermining our soldiers at every bloody opportunity ( eg 1917 , wwii , vietnam ) and stabbing those who go into harms way to protect them in the back . 
  i have always been an huge jlc fan , and recently finally decided to pull the trigger on a reverso classic as i wanted a dress watch to round out my small collection ( a rolex explorer and an oris . ), 
  the reverso i chose does n't have any complications , as the night/day duo had both a smaller face and was thicker , neither of which appealed . 
  the range has recently been changed from the previous grande and etc to a simple small , medium , large : on my wrist i felt the large sat best . 
  i also have a penchant for understated watches ( much as described in the recent explorer post , which reasonated strongly with my own taste ) , and the reverso as seen here is indisputably a classic . 
  modern reversos such as mine are automatic , a recent innovation as earlier releases were manual . 
  the watch will run for 40hrs from being fully wound ; my next purchase is going to be a self-winding box !, 
  i am very pleased with this watch and glad to have finally added it to my small , but i like to think well-formed , collection . 
  yeah the pantheon is literally awesom : standing in the middle there inspires sheer awe at the ancient romans ' engineering , it is quite remarkable . 
  rome is a fantastic city , full of amazing monuments , but even there the pantheon stands somewhat apart in its majesty . 
  my personal favourite monument is titus 's arch , but the pantheon is probably the most impressive ( more so even than the collosseum imo . ), 
  great work , you did the plane justice . 
  i love the late marque spitfires , with the griffon engine , `` pointy '' tail and especially the bubble-tops !, 
  i used to have a monaco , but one without complications ( just the basic model ) . 
  mine had a blue face too and i agree they are lovely . 
  the gym/coffee shop over the road : coffee first thing in the morning ( they open 6:30 am ) and workout after work , it 's great . 
  yeah , with the beefy profile of the big griffon engine they look awesome !, 
  1917 : general strike because the railway in nsw introduced punch cards to monitor workers ( the horror ! ), 
  even in the midst of wwi while our diggers fought and died in the flanders mud - this was defeated by everyday aussies pulling together to do the strikers work and keep our soldiers supplied ;, 
  wwii : no support for the war until germany attacked the ussr ( due to pervasive communist support among australian unions ) , consistent strikes and disruption of the war effort over petty quibbles that included thefts , wrecking of equipment and even refusing to unload hospital ships full of wounded troops - unimaginable bastardry that on occasion required military intervention to suppress ;, 
  vietnam : again , communist support led to strikes to make life for our 19yo conscripts even harder - eg aus post refusing to deliver mail and wharfies refusing to load/unload ships ( the `` punch a postie '' poster from vietnam results from this ) . 
  these are just the wartime betrayals ; however , there are many other incidents which cast a bleak light on australian unionists selfish and corrupt attitudes . 
  no worries !, 
  there is still an huge amount of bitterness among diggers towards the unions over all this , but in contemporary terms the relentless corruption is realistically more of an ongoing issue ( although actu leader sally `` i 'll break any law * i * disagree with '' mcmanus comes from a very communist union background that she certainly has not rejected , so the potential for more of the type of incident certainly can not be discounted . . ), 
  not * all * israelis mind , just the settlers and those who support their neo-colonialism . 
  sure , though the classic has only a single motion/face and it 's just a plain back : [ here 's a couple of shots i just took ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/g5iqm ), 
  i agree the vietnam war was n't something we should necessarily have been involved in , but take it out on the pollies - not the men ( some only kids really ) already leading a much harsher existence in the cause of what was , rightly or wrongly , considered our collective , national security and best interests . 
  gulf ii was pretty sketchy , but at least everyone refrained from meting out the treatment the unions inflicted upon that generation of australian soldiers . 
  it 's an interesting question , and something i had n't considered : thank you for raising it . 
  at the moment i tend to cycle wearing my watches to keep them wound , but even when i let them run down winding them back up is not exactly onerous . 
  the main reason i wanted the wonder is because i had thought it was better to keep watches running ; however , even in that case the extra wear would probably outweigh that benefit . 
  i will look into some more and think this through . 
  cheers !, 
  it is not our decision to make as individuals : one either respects the rule of law and works with the system to change what is unjust , or is a renegade who does n't respect our society or its values . 
  who is she to decide which laws do and do n't count for her ? 
  is it cool is we all ignore those laws we disagree with ? 
  i believe my comments cover that : i both explain how this spirit lives on and how it is the ongoing issues with corruption which are more significant today . 
  i 'm sorry , but did you just equate australia in 2017 to :, 
   nazi germany , slavery in the us , segregation , apartheid, 
  i mean you did , but is that really what you believe ? 
  thanks , that 's good to know and clearly i need to do some reading . 
  you moved it to the philosophical question surrounding the rule of law , literally positing that as a question . 
  thank you !, 
  yes , i like this model as it really is the classic reverso ; as beautiful as the sun/moon duos and etc are for me this is reverso , and has always been what i have hankered after . 
  bastion of western principles in the me , israel is . 
  like ~ ~ free speech ~ ~ shit , no not that . .
