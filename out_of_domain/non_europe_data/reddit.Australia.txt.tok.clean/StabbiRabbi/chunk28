  every year hundreds , if not thousands , of iranian national police die in vicious firefights with heavily armed , taliban-affiliated drug smugglers along their border . 
  the iranians are certainly no friends of the taliban ( that is pakistan , where the shia minority increasingly suffer persecution too ) and i am nearly positive do not support the insurgency . 
  herat is perhaps a special case being in the non-pashtun north and having a long cultural association with persian cultures . 
  ( not that that excuses any iranian transgressions there of course ! ) . 
  with a all due respect ( because , as we will get to i ** do ** respect most of your opinion as stated in your comment above ) i think your perception of the iran/afghan relationship/situation may be slightly off , although it is entirely possible mine is a bit too and the truth lies somewhere in the middle !, 
  i agree entirely with your comments regarding the regime vs the people of iran ; however , as i wrote in another comment moments ago ( so please excuse me quoting myself !, 
   the fall of communism shows there is nothing more likely to end an autocratic dictatorship ( or theocratic dictatorship by extension ) than opening up access to the rest of the world !, 
  why do you think the ccp ( chinese communist party ) have relaxed the economic constraints , but continue to enforce strict social controls especially over the internet ? 
  i also agree entirely with your commentary about the iranian regime 's interference in other regional disputes , although i would slightly temper that criticism with an acknowledgment that they do genuinely see themselves as the shield of oppressed shiite minorities throughout the region and that this may well be what drives their interference as much as any imperialistic ambitions . 
  nonetheless the difference in one of motive , not effect and thus i can not in all conscience support these adventures in any way . 
  all in all i agree entirely with the sentiment of your post and can readily acknowledge its contribution to the discussion ( as opposed to many replies i get which are just efforts to run interference ... ) , hence you got my upvote, 
  ok , so at last we can find some common ground to discuss what we 're both talking about . 
  i agree a literal application of native title would not be politically acceptable in the israel/palestine situation ; however , some kind of similar system to allow sharing of resources actually sounds remarkably similar to elements of your mooted solution as quoted below :, 
   i would have both sides draw their maps of what land they would like to fall within their borders , with each side creating a palestinian state roughly equal to the size of the territories , give or take ~ 5 % . 
  in the areas claimed by both , i would have referendums to find out what the people want . 
  then i would attempt to draw borders that make sense based on those local referendums . 
  then i would have a short period of time during which any israeli citizen who ends up in palestine can be compensated for their land and move , as can any palestinian resident that would find him or herself in israel . 
  those that stay would forfeit their prior status and accept the new citizenship . 
  of course there are security , resource , and other issues that need to be addressed, 
  your vision of intermingled populations would be wonderful , but it would require something like our native title laws to enable ( so israelis who chose to live in palestine would not be abused or vice versa ) . 
  tbh it is not something i had considered possible due to the security implications and depth of feeling on both sides ; however , if it could be made to work it would be perfect . 
  i phrased my proposed division of land in language you took exception to , but only because i couched it in terms with which i was familiar due to my country 's treatment of native title . 
  i did n't mean any racism by the way i described the assignation of land , i just described a solution that could be practically implemented . 
  your proposal for each side staking their claims for areas with subsequent horse-trading taking place over specific parcels of land is what i always understood that the process would be . 
  i did not actually have specific areas in mind beyond the general gaza/west bank/ej/wj areas - certainly not specific grid references as you seem to assume ( not saying you did , just that that was how i interpreted it ... ) . 
  within that that context i apologise for my use of the term ** greater ** right , within the language as you interpret it and your understanding of how a solution might work it it is not applicable and i am happy to withdraw it . 
  i think the biggest difficulty in our discussion was derived from different our understanding of what terms , words and even the parameters of the discussion were . 
  i do n't actually disagree with what you 've said now you 've explained it and i hope you can see how my australian cultural references influenced my choice of words now too . 
  one thing i 'd take slight objection to is that the article you referenced seems to consider all criticisms of israel to be anti-semitic in origin whereas i would differentiate criticism of the government 's / idf 's actions without attacking israel/israelis per se as my criticisms do if you read them ( bearing in mind the difference in understanding of some specific words ) from people who say things like `` you people ... '', 
  i understand you did n't realise the difference between aborigines and aboriginals as words and meant no disrespect to them - i hope you can extend me the same understanding now . 
  edit : so you understand :, 
   native title is able to be possessed by a community or individual depending on the content of the traditional laws and customs ; inalienable other than by surrender to the crown ; and ranging from access and usage rights to rights of exclusive possession . 
  native title rights and interests are based on laws and customs that pre-date the british acquisition of sovereignty , and may exist over land and waters to the extent that they are consistent with other rights established over the land by law or executive action, 
  that was from the wikipedia article . 
  in practice this means all that i described . 
  i work in a mining related field and am well aware of the process by which aboriginal land rights laws are applied . 
  here is some information on the process from the northern land council , an aboriginal run body that controls access to aboriginal land rights controlled land in the northern territory . 
  similar bodies exist throughout australia with similar processes :, 
  ditto for yours . 
  i 'm only an armchair expert so you may well be better informed than i ; however , i did n't write anything that i do not know to be at least partially the case . 
  studying iran would be fascinating , as i mentioned is some post ( maybe to you , maybe not - it 's hard to keep track ! ), 
  my dad goes there quite often on business and loves the country and the people . 
  the regime 's stranglehold is a tragedy imo and i in no way support them other than efforts to hurt them actually hurt the people more which strengthens their hold by increasing anger at the outsiders . 
  so often in this sub especially arguments erupt because people are looking at things from different perspectives despite sharing essentially similar views - i think we just fell into that trap ... 
  well , yes . 
  if you look above my post you can see it right there ... 
  israelis get their news from right wing media like the jerusalem post and via government propaganda that whitewashes over its disgusting actions in the occupied territories whilst hyping up the threats of terrorists and iranians under the bed . 
  the facts of it are that many , many more palestinians die at israeli hands than vice versa . 
  that does not justify any deaths , israeli or palestinian , but should give you a little pause for thought amidst your parroting of likud bullshit . 
  be honest - if you are in israel right now and not just talking hyperbolic crap - what do you see looking out of your bedroom window right now ? 
  does it look * anything * like [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10982394/israel-gaza-conflict-in-pictures-fighting-continues-as-un-seeks-to-broker-truce.html?frame=2982372 ) ? 
  and here we have a perfect example of why people say the pro-israeli lobby is paranoid ... 
  and where the false accusations of anti-semitism in this sub come from . 
  the facts are israel is only responsible for its own actions so if you got caught up in traffic that is only israel 's fault if it happened in tel aviv , jerusalem or gaza . 
   because the dem candidate 's stance on israel is so troubling that it suddenly becomes more important than issues like gay marriage or taxes . 
  what does that mean exactly ? 
  as in what is so troubling about a president who is pushing for an end to the conflict between israel and palestine ? 
  do you think the ferocity of the arguments here in / r/worldnews are because of that extreme degree of insularity and the shock people who come to a forum for open discussion like reddit feel when confronted by opinions that do n't fit the only views they 've heard up until the point they read others ' views here maybe ? 
  in gaza . 
  it is the west bank that 's the main area under negotiation and which is currently suffering the worst aspects of the apartheid style split legal system for settlers and palestinians as well as constantly being eroded by new settlements and fatah rule in the west bank . 
  i think they 'd accept the '67 lines of demarcation ( even though they should get the '48 borders really imo ) ; they might even accept the current positions were their area not still constantly being eroded piecemeal by new settlements ... 
  exactly , which is yet another reason it 's in israel 's interest too to let discussions move forward and allow a state to be formed . 
  of course israeli incursions would equally be acts of war under those circumstances which is one of the reasons the israeli right is so vehemently opposed to statehood for palestine . 
  israel actually broke the ceasefire in the first act that led to that war when they fired a missile into a gazan home to kill a hamas leader together with the seven innocent palestinian civilians who also happened to be within the blast radius at the time . 
  that 's many more civilians killed in the first act than by hamas rockets . 
  the rockets were retaliation for that attack . 
  not that any of that justifies either side 's violence . 
  btw the differences between a missile used by the israelis and the hamas rockets are that israeli ( well , us actually - it was a hellfire ) missiles actually hit things and kill people always instead of being shot down by iron dome or exploding harmlessly in the countryside as happens to * most * hamas rockets and the missiles carry a much larger , more destructive warhead . 
  i thought the settler violence and its companion set of dual laws were quite common knowledge : it is the laws that lead to the description of the situation as apartheid . 
  in fact there are one set of laws for settlers that puts their crimes down as assaults - if they are ever prosecuted which only happens rarely anyway - instead of terrorism when a palestinian harms a settler or their property ( this has a huge impact as a terrorism charge results in your house being bulldozed ! ), 
  and allows them far greater freedoms than the other set of laws ( known iirc as `` military ordinances '' ! ), 
  for the palestinians . 
  the laws the palestinians live under restrict their movements , ability to earn a living and rights to live an unimpeded life generally . 
  ( hence apartheid . ), 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/latest-news-wires/2014/0420/do-west-bank-israelis-palestinians-live-under-different-set-of-laws ) explains things much better than i am able to . 
  it 's always encouraging to hear talk of those israelis - of which i ken ow there are many - and saddening to see how underrepresented their voices are both here and generally ... 
  that all sounds very reasonable to me ( though i 'm just an outside observer , not viscerally bound up in the whole thing ... ) and workable . 
  it 's always encouraging in this sub when people can be reasonable as all too often people posit completely unreasonable and unreasoned arguments that are just parrotings of some extreme view or another ( i always try not to fall into that trap , though i guess some of my own views probably do come across as biased in the heat of a discussion :\\ - i do n't mean them to though !!! ), 
  you make a good argument - hopefully once the current generation of leaders move on things can move along without their prejudices and fear of loss-of-face . 
  your proposed solution gives the palestinians a reasonable end goal whilst acknowledging very real israeli concerns and fears . 
  * the palestinians will have to make some concessions towards ameliorating those fears , just as israel will have to demonstrate that they are acting from a position of genuine good-faith in exactly that same way . 
  * nobody wants another gaza in any sense . 
  my only fear is that the next generation will have so much fear and anger inculcated into them by their respective elder 's propaganda , actions and reactions that the same problems as we see now will be perpetuated , but i hope that is a groundless fear and enough progress will be made now to insure against that ... 
  good post man . 
  edit : * the italicised sentence in the 2nd paragraph was added as i forgot to include it at first ... 
  hmmm , i 'm not sure what 's going on in the cartoon , but my username is just a nonsense visual rhyme - i just thought it looked cool . 
  after being asked multiple times , i thought about it and decided i would pronounce it stabby rabbi ( stab-ee rab-eye ) - not any of the other possible ways ( the most bizarre of which i have seen suggested being stab-i-rabbi - which is just fucked up ... ) . 
  that means it would refer ( if it actually had any meaning , which it does n't ) more to a rabbi that liked stabbing stuff than stabbing rabbis , which is obviously not cool . 
  tbh i regret the choice of username - too many people use it to draw false conclusions about me based on their misinterpretative mis-assignation of meaning to it and i get asked stupid questions about all too often : /, 
  at least you used a cartoon , even if i ca n't quite interpret the cartoon 's intended meaning !, 
  is the guy with the knife a rabbi who has seen off the ( clearly anti-semitic ) attackers or is that guy the attacker himself ? 
  ( i ca n't tell coz he does n't look like an islamist terrorist or a neo-nazi especially - he 's wearing what * could * be an orthodox hat , but also what * could * be a shemagh ... ), 
  if he 's the attacker then that 's certainly ** not ** what my username would refer to ( if it referred to anything !, 
  ) ; if he just stabbed the anti-semitic attackers then it * could * be what my name refers to . 
  ( except , of course , that it does n't actually refer to anything ! ), 
  how 's that ? 
  clear as mud ? 
  ... for which we should all be very , very thankful !, 
  netanyahu 's reelection may just be the best thing to have happened to the palestinian people since about 1946 ... 
  probably party to more inside information than you are ...
