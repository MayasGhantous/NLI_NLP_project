  my heartfelt apologies if i upset you . 
  i hope that this has now set the record straight and corrected , or at least acknowledged , whatever bias was previously present !, 
  that is perhaps fair and it 's interesting to hear from a perspective so different from my own , though if you read into it the british very actually very happy - in fact very keen !, 
  - to leave by ' 48 . 
  if you look at it from their position , they were in a no-win situation there in which they could n't possibly be able to resolve the conflict and thus gain the gratitude of either group - the inherent tensions were too deeply rooted and profound for such an outcome by that stage of the game . 
  they were just sustaining casualties and bearing a huge financial burden for being piggy-in-the-middle , a position from where they could only attract more bad feeling ( such as that israeli narrative of the zionists `` fighting to kick the english out '' as well as lingering distrust from arab nationalist movements for * helping * the zionists in their eyes , on top , of course , of the pre-existing colonial fallout ... ) and gain no possible benefit . 
  i 'm glad you and i discussed this further - it 's conversations like ours where i learn of new perspectives ( and confront the gaps or slight imbalance in my own thinking ) that help me persevere through the sometimes depressing stream of invective that all too often constitutes the `` discussion '' in this sub . 
  all that that crap and even the false accusations and ad hominem attacks that one suffers ( i bet you do too ? ), 
  occasionally in these threads are worth it for moments like this when a modicum of understanding is reached !, 
  either of us could have just written the other off as a mindless bigot as is the sub 's commenter-bases 's wont , but we kept talking ; in so doing we both learned something new and found our common ground . 
  really cool man , really cool . 
  fair dinkum you did mate !, 
  ca n't believe the little fella laid a snapper on the poop deck and you thought it was muffin but !, 
  did n't it fucking reek ? 
  cunt !, 
  ( in australia at least . ), 
  link straight to article : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-palestinians-tax-revenue.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0, 
   `` given the deteriorating situation in the middle east , '' mr. netanyahu said in the statement , `` one must act responsibly and with due consideration alongside a determined struggle against extremist elements . '', 
  absolutely hilarious quote . 
  netanyahu the peacemaker !, 
  they should never have withheld the funds in the first place , although , as the article says , it is a frequently employed tactic of the israeli government . 
  they * definitely * should n't be threatening to withhold future disbursals should the pa be so cheeky as to go to the icc !, 
  it 's a nasty game that 's being played . 
  do n't forget nz , the scrappy little runt that 's still a member of the 5-eyes !, 
  of course he knows all about the internet , did * none * of you guys read about the [ russian troll factory ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/30dfe4/one_professional_russian_troll_tells_all/ ) ? 
  vice-versa with netanyahu 's visible antipathy for obama ... 
  and everything bad that happens in palestine is down to those pesky palestinians !, 
  rainbow flags everywhere ? 
  do they really hold `` death to america '' rallies in israel ? 
  i knew they do some terrible things to the palestinians , but america is israel 's ally and gives them trillions in aid ... 
  well , at least you get something to be happy about . 
  that 's not the impression one gains from reddit , specifically this sub . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not true , but some of the most vehemently right-wing , pro-netanyahu style israeli policies turn out to be jewish americans . 
  disappointed in you , / u/stevefromretail - i thought you were acknowledging the reality of the current israeli regime 's warmongering and right-wing extremism for a refreshing change , but really you were making a `` joke '' ... 
  oh no , what a terrible chore for you :p, 
  seriously though all i 'd want to do is cuddle her right back !, 
  stripping is n't quite selling herself !, 
  i think it would be a tough way to earn a living if you 'd just turned 18 though , i would agree almost any other option is probably going to turn out better if there 's any other option available . 
  op , things sound pretty tough right now , but it sounds like you want to better your situation . 
  stripping could end up leading to a pretty unhealthy lifestyle both physically and mentally . 
  i think you should try to find something else if you can . 
  finally let me just say that although life may seem very bleak and lonely right now you 're still young and things will change constantly throughout the rest of your life , sometimes for the worse , but from now probably for the better !, 
  the decisions you make are what will decide that and now you 're getting old enough to make your own decisions . 
  you 're not a `` loser '' because at 17 you 're in a tight place , you did n't make the decisions that put you where you are now . 
  you can get yourself out of it now though . 
  good luck whatever you do !, 
  i think he mean it is a threat to his [ netanyahu 's ] political survival , assuming all goes well , after all the dirty tricks he 's pulled trying to derail it and his use of it as a stick to keep himself in power in israel !, 
  what a fantastic job !, 
  what woman * would n't * want to be an elite member of kim 's pleasure squad ? 
  only 25 % of the population , if the election results are to be relieved ... 
  yet here we are . 
  it 's exactly that unrelenting sanctimonious hypocrisy that i find so incredible, 
  it 's more a threat to netanyahu 's political survival given the extraordinarily bare-faced effrontery of the lies and manipulations he has attempted to effect to prevent it and keep israel under his yoke !, 
  in his twisted mind i guess * his * survival is * israel 's * survival . 
  in fact the israelis have as much to gain as the rest of world does from improved relations with iran . 
  all they have lose is perhaps a portion of their us aid money . 
  and maybe the opportunity to cloak their bombing of their neighbours in a veil of self-defence ... 
  why is this even counted as news ? 
  it would have been utterly remiss of them * not * to spy on a nation that has attacked their citizens once already and regularly uses the the issue to whip its population into ecstasies of patriotic fervour whenever it needs to divert their attention from domestic political failings !, 
  in addition to the citizen protection issue large gas reserves have been found near the falklands , an economic issue they are well aware of . 
  interesting analysis , surprisingly so tbh, 
  only to carry korans and suicide bombs though !, 
  do you guys really call paving stones/flagstones/pavement slabs `` tiles '' ? 
  in australia [ tiles ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tile ) are made of ceramics or glass maybe , not concrete and are tiled in place with grout of some kind ; paving stones are made of concrete , used for sidewalks and laid without anything to fix them in place . 
  like that paving . 
  i argue exactly this in / r/worldnews all the time - i could n't agree with you more !, 
  looks like an mc-47 combat kitty to me ... 
  if you 'd only stayed till you were 13 you 'd be singing a different tune ... 
  that 's one stoned looking easter bunny !, 
  exactly the same thing happened in jalawa and other towns retaken from isis . 
  shia militias and shia members of the iraqi security forces regularly assault locals after accusing them of collaborating with isis and loot homes , businesses and anywhere else with anything to take . 
  it 's made even worse for locals as isis leave hundreds of ieds hidden throughout the areas they 're forced out of . 
  in jalawa the kurdish peshmerga were on hand to control shiite excesses , but the the kurds are n't on the scene in places like tikrit or even mosul , not wanting to take casualties in areas they 'd just vacate anyway , that as sunni centres are particularly vulnerable . 
  and so the cycle continues ... 
  some places have real difficulties with this kind of problem . 
  russia spans 7 different time zones and not only do the railways all tun on moscow time , [ some towns/areas have to manage with multiple time zones ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_in_russia#federal_subjects_with_multiple_offsets_at_the_same_timehttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_in_russia#federal_subjects_with_multiple_offsets_at_the_same_time ) !, 
  you 're right though , in most countries people just pick a zone and deal with . 
  for example , south australia ( an australian state ) is one of the few places in the world to use a 1/2 hour timezone , which the whole state adheres to despite straddling two timezones and having a relatively large distance between the `` real '' local time at opposite ends of the state . 
  [ they are currently discussing moving to either western or eastern australian standard time ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/south-australia-may-change-timezone-to-move-in-line-with-wa-or-eastern-states/story-fnj4ag6f-1227208986517 ) to move away from the 1/2 hour offset time , but the difference in local real times is making it hard to choose which !, 
  they will , however , just choose one so the entire state - not just a city - behaves as you describe , committing to a single time statewide . 
  after reading some of the toxic opinions posted in this sub i have begun to doubt the viability of a two-state solution between israel and palestine . 
  so many of the pro-israeli lobby simply wo n't give an inch or even acknowledge that they should have to . 
  in fact they ca n't even seem to comprehend why they should compromise in the slightest - morally or even out of self-interest for peace . 
  they are happy with things exactly as they are , until they can eliminate the palestinians entirely of course . 
  admittedly these voices are those of the extreme right , but the settlers are the most extreme right wing israelis out there judging by their behaviour and treatment of the defenceless ( due to israeli military law in the occupied territories ) palestinians whose homes they have usurped ; and it is exactly these settlers who will have to surrender their homes for a viable two-state solution ... 
  perhaps then a one-state solution is the answer ? 
  israel would absorb all the palestinians as full citizens , with full rights ( as arabs apparently enjoy now , the israelis among us regularly reassure the rest of us ) . 
  it would then be a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state - as the levant was for millenia , until the 20th century and the rise of nationalism - so perhaps changing the name back to palestine , or something else entirely would be appropriate ? 
  not many people do n't support the right of the jewish people to a homeland , but there are severe problems with israel as it currently functions . 
  perhaps the time has come for the next evolution , as you suggest . 
  certainly some kind of solution * must * be found : if not a viable , fair two-state then maybe a single ( but obviously adapted to be fair , non-apartheid/equal religious and ethnic freedoms ) state solution * is * the answer ? 
  hezbollah do n't conduct genocide against anyone ; they have n't attacked any us interests since beirut in '82 and in the southern part of lebanon they effectively function as a government in terms of providing social services such as schools and clinics because the central government is unable to ... 
  the civil war ended a long time ago . 
  it was awful , but civil wars * are * awful . 
  since then hezbollah 's role has changed and so has the organisation . 
  also do n't believe all of the israeli propaganda - israel has always been the aggressor in lebanon . 
  read about the [ massacres at the sabra and shatila refugee camps ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre ) where idf supported phalangists murdered thousands of mainly shiite lebanese and palestinians displaced by the [ israeli invasion of lebanon ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_lebanon_war ) with the active collusion of idf troops who facilitated the massacres with their control of the areas surrounding the camps ... 
  that is hezbollah 's `` origin story '' ; now tell whose the good guy and who is the bad guy . 
  it 's not as clear cut as your post above tries to paint it , is it ? 
  lol , netanyahu you so crazy !,
