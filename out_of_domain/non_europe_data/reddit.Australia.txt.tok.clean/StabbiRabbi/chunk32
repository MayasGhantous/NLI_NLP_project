  leading experts in humanitarian law maintain that effective control may also exist when the army controls key points in a particular area , reflecting its power over the entire area and preventing an alternative central government from formulating and carrying out its powers . 
  the broad scope of israeli control in the gaza strip , which exists despite the lack of a physical presence of idf soldiers in the territory , creates a reasonable basis for the assumption that this control amounts to `` effective control , '' such that the laws of occupation continue to apply . 
  i have a 6 with the latest ios , but had that precise issue as i described . 
  perhaps i had used * we 're * over * were * a number of times in a row ( which is all i had to do to `` train '' it back into acting correctly ... ) and made it `` think '' that was what i wanted ; i agree the autocorrect is now really very good , but i really did have that exact issue myself until i got sick of noticing it had happened too late after sending texts , emails or reddit comments and `` retrained '' literally this weekend . 
  the quotation marks are because obviously one does not literally train autocorrect nor does one 's iphone literally think !, 
  so easy to use those terms though lol . 
  that 's a pretty facile reading of what happened . 
  [ ahmed shah massoud ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmad_shah_massoud ) from the pajshir valley was one of the most effective mujahideen commanders to fight the soviets ( despite his not being supplied with any ksa or pakistani distributed us weapons precisely because he was not a pashtun allied with pakistan 's isi who created the taliban ) and later the taliban before al-qaeda assassinated him days before 9/11 . 
  it was the [ northern alliance ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_alliance ) which was centred around his commanders and allies with which nato partnered in 2001 to temporarily defeat the taliban , who did not recover sufficient strength to seriously resume their insurgency until years later when the us military had its attention focussed on iraq . 
  they were * all * former mujahideen . 
  not all mujahideen became taliban by any means . 
  / u/desertrebel does an excellent job of providing further context in his reply to you too . 
  it would be great if cops could , you know , like refrain from killing people without damn good reason . 
  in australia we have police shootings - some are naturally bound to occur when you have armed cops dealing with dangerous criminals , crazy people , meth heads and so on - though far fewer per capita than in the states because cops here know they are accountable for their actions . 
  each and every shooting has to be justified , although imo cops still get away with too many borderline cases here . 
  we do n't have to teach our kids not to make sudden movements , not to make direct eye contact and etc. 
  i always just talk to cops as though they are a friend 's parents , polite and respectful , but not instantly submissive . 
  here , if you are polite and rational you are very unlikely to get shot without any special `` survive an encounter with a cop '' training . 
  would n't you like your kids to be able to grow up knowing cops will protect them and are n't dangerous creatures to placate if you want to stay alive ? 
  edit : wow , did n't think this would be such a controversial position to take i must say . 
  i have n't criticised cops per se , just said imo it 'd be kinda cool if people 's kids did n't have to be so wary around them ... 
  nobody except , of course the idf , who chip in when they can with air strikes to kill off the groups fighting them ... 
  these guys are just plain crazy and they seem to be losing it more as greater pressure is put on them militarily . 
  after that brief moment of sanity where they announced they 'd [ imprison men wearing skinny jeans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/31eoiv/isis_threatens_to_imprison_men_caught_wearing/ ) , they move back into nutjob mode with this bbq for no one when people under their control * must * be going hungry . 
  christians could eat non-halal chicken even if isis fighters could n't , although i do n't suppose they much care about what happens to the christians under their control ... 
  i 'm in australia where as far as i 'm aware there is a very low incidence of anti-semitism ( i 'm happy and proud of my country to say ) and where there have been no outrageous , notable anti-semitic incidents in our history despite there having been jewish australians since 1788 , our founding year . 
  of course anti-semitism exists here as it does everywhere , we have our share of despicable bigots like any society , but as i said there is a very low incidence . 
  i also spent some of my childhood living in the uk where similar conditions apply , albeit with a larger population so more extreme extremists obviously being extant . 
  still very low incidence of anti-semitism than in europe though , both traditionally and to this day ... 
  growing up in cultures that are if anything more inclined to philosemitism than anti-semitism may have made me a bit naive about the true extent of anti-semitism elsewhere and how entrenched it really is , but honestly to me the original protest was not anti-semitic in its nature . 
  were there anti-semites in the the group ? 
  possibly , probably even , but was the group a group of anti-semites ? 
  i would still say no . 
  people in europe , the uk and australia do want to see a just resolution to the israel-palestine situation to the point where anti-semitism linked to that issue is occurring ( amongst people too stupid to disassociate jews from the right wing israeli regime i might add ... ) , but to a very great extent not all protest about palestine is driven by any anti-semitic animus .

  sorry the last one 's from the daily mail - i just did a quick search and it was the first one that came up ... 
  i was looking for the results of an official survey carried out last year in the uk that made the same findings , but did n't have time now to locate it . 
  nothing excuses anti-semitism of course - like any bigotry ( including that of the israeli right wing , let 's not pretend they 're not just as bad please ! ), 
  it is utterly vile . 
  ( my reasoning does not include muslim populations in the countries i discuss either ; that is another , more complex issue and one i am not culturally able to advance comment on . ), 
  i hope that the links show you though that many people in the west , outside of america too , are not inherently anti-semitic and also highlight the relationship between anti-semitism and the palestine issue . 
  whilst obviously complex , i think all taken together it supports my reading of the video , ie that the original protest was not anti-semitic ( unlike the awful soccer thugs ! ), 
  and by extension that my beliefs are not overly naive or optimistic ... ( with full acknowledgement that there are definitely anti-semites present in almost all cultures and therefore in all groups within those cultures ; i 'm not blind or wilfully ignorant . ), 
  i was replying specifically to the comment above me , not generalising about anything . 
  my words were a direct response to his , not a blanket criticism of america or its police . 
  i think arseholes per capita is probably pretty even , although we have less armed arseholes which is obviously a factor that must be accounted for . 
  ( btw that was n't a dig at us gun laws either - i like guns myself and wish we could have laws that at least allowed us rifles like you guys can have . 
  i was just recognising that it 's a factor in cop behaviour . ), 
  as with anything ymmv , i was n't talking to or about * you * before !, 
  ca n't people discuss and compare their experiences without provoking such an aggravated response ? 
  i 'm sorry , clearly you either personally know john rambo or are a serious student of his career , perhaps to doctoral level ? 
  having only seen the film once a long time ago i am not as familiar with the man or his work , let alone his colleagues ' subsequent careers as you clearly are . 
  please let me apologise and bow to your superior knowledge of which mujahideen he fought with ( and , may i venture , your superior intellect too ... ) !, 
  clearly i misread the particular history in this case and so am pleased to admit i was wrong . 
  well * i * ca n't , but if their parents could they might not have to teach them to treat cops like dangerous , wild animals as op discussed . 
  how do * you * treat cops ? 
  no , no . 
  you were talking about john rambo and the muj he fought with to help destroy the evil russians that were fighting for , literally , the evil empire of the ussr , the demise of which the raw justice of deaths such as theirs helped to ultimately hasten . 
  do n't try to move the goalposts here . . 
  sure , you would hope * anybody * has that much sense . 
  and if somebody is armed and does n't the cops have every right and reason to respond with force : they 're there to protect the innocent , not people running around with guns . 
  in this particular situation who knows if the cop did the right thing or the wrong thing yet , although it certainly sounds like he was well within the parameters of a legal shot as the kid was armed and not surrendering . 
  that 's not what i was talking about though , i was just responding to the comment above mine that discussed having to teach your kids to act around cops like you would around wild animals . 
  that 's all . 
  answer me one question : do the idf kill iranian and hezbollah fighters in syria ? 
  in which case their action was even more crazy ... 
  i 'm from australia , but was in llandovery in december and will be back there in september when i come over to the uk again . 
  i used to live in the uk and know the beacons quite well . 
  i really love all those places ... 
  fridge, 
  do n't forget to get yourself wormed !, 
  i 've only ever been on holiday so i do n't know anything about the bad side of actually living there , although thinking about it can definitely imagine drawbacks !, 
  cardiff is a great city too . 
  at least it 's reparable - it 's always tragic when a warbird crashes , even a replica . 
  that omaka air show would be great , i 'd love to go . 
  i 've been to wanaka a couple of times and am going next easter , but will have to hit omaka up sometime as well . 
  actually it looks like a santeria fetish to me , they encourage the moss to grow like that . 
  a fetish of that kind would have been placed there to appease babal\u00fa-ay\u00e9 , whose praise name is al\u00e1pa-d\u00fap\u00e9 , meaning `` one who kills and is thanked for it '' . 
  babal\u00fa-ay\u00e9 is the orisha of the earth , hence the moss and other plant matter . 
   now he has a ~ ~ cute ~ ~ baby, 
  ftfy, 
  did you inherit his brains op ? 
  meanwhile in / r/worldnews the consensus is that the rallies were totally justified expressions of disagreement with ( non-existent in australia ) sharia law ... 
  hmmm , now i do n't know who the trolls really are - this story is very plausible , but so was the one two or three days ago that told almost the exact same story , with the same details , but about a different troll . 
  a guy that time . 
  so are the stories true or is this anti-russian propaganda ? 
  i 'm no fan of crazy vlad putin , but what i 'm really sick of is fucking propaganda whoever it comes from ...
