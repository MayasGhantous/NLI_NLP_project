   we shed our blood and we live here . 
  our life is the continuation of the past and so too is the spilt blood . 
  a nation does not build its life except on the foundations of its past and blood is joined to blood, 
  according to zerubavel to advocate relaxation and do concessions towards the arabs was to follow the galut ( exile ) mentality . 
  according to frankel this kind of mythology was an important part of the second aliyah 's political legacy . 
  even if not yet strong enough to instigate violence , elements of the zionist movement were clearly * planning * for it !, 
  this alone renders the original comment by / u/drboomkin entirely disingenuous !, 
  by 1920 the terrorist [ ze'ev jabotinsky ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ze%27ev_jabotinsky ) who founded irgun was already stockpiling weapons ; by 1931 he had actually formed irgun , the aims of which were entirely violent . 
  clearly zionism was not simply, 
   peaceful immigration, 
  this violence of intent was published in zionist newspapers and pamphlets : a modern example is israel attacking other countries that simply profess hatred for it . 
  ( eg killing iranian 's fighting isis because they are in syria which is next to palestine and iran has made anti-israeli statements . ), 
  edit : cleared up some phrasing that it was pointed out was perhaps a little unfair to the zionists . 
  * i 'm * not trying to paint an unbalanced picture ... 
  this aircraft was captured intact after the pilot was forced to land at an airfield in occupied holland by bf 110s . 
  it was flown on a tour of france and germany to acquaint luftwaffe pilots with the b-17 before serving with [ kg200 ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kampfgeschwader_200 ) , a luftwaffe special operations squadron . 
  the aircraft is painted in the green and grey camouflage colours worn by the raaf aircraft defending darwin during world war ii and in operations in the south west pacific . 
  the aircraft carries the markings of an aircraft of no 457 squadron raaf , specifically that flown by wing commander r.h. ( bobby ) gibbes oam dso dfc . 
  so you 're saying that israel 's stance on iran is entirely unjustified too ? 
  how can one be and the other not ? 
  particularly when the iranians are n't taking over any israeli territory . 
  given your comment history this attitude is surprisingly open minded . 
  if you read more carefully you 'll see i 'm not `` blaming the jews '' for anything . 
  i 'm not even blaming the zionists for anything . 
  i 'm simply saying that * some * zionists were planning to fight right from the start and thus that your original comment was disingenuous , which is after all what is being discussed . 
  yeah , ok , now you 're straying way beyond the bounds of what we were discussing - i was simply proving how and why / u/drboomkin 's comment was disingenuous . 
  the zionists did not merely fight because they were forced to . 
  * some * went there looking for a fight . 
  perhaps to an extent , but given the history i doubt there will much that is good to be omitted from those organisations ' histories !, 
  no doubt the * worst * elements will be emphasised , but any major release of soviet era nkvd -  kgb files will be interesting , just as the stasi files were ( read [ stasiland ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasiland ) by anna funder for a fascinating insight into that organisation ) when east germany collapsed . 
  ( btw putin was a kgb colonel in leipzig , east germany when that regime fell , an event that no doubt had a great effect on his psyche ! ), 
  is reacting to statements of violent intent completely wrong then in your view ? 
  nice debating style too , btw . 
  reminds me of a primary school kid :, 
  `` you 're a poo-head '' says one , `` no you 're a poo-head , you 're a poo-head '' screams the other , collapsing in a tearful tantrum ... 
  edit : punctuation , dammit, 
  yet another point that isis and ~ ~ israel ~ ~ netanyahu are on the same page about . 
  edit : changed attribution of shared goals with isis to make it fair and accurate . 
  well the germans were not big fans of russia at that point in time , but sure , a careful bullshit filter will be needed when reading the published documents , or rather the reports about them as i am neither able to read cyrillic/russian nor am i likely to visit ukraine even if i could !, 
  i still think they 'll be interesting . 
  your last paragraph is completely self-contradictory . 
  they moved into an area , taking it over * defensively * ? 
  reminds of the classic `` we had to destroy the village in order to save it '' quote from vietnam !, 
  iran 's connection with hezbollah might be the idf 's excuse for attacking the iranians fighting isis , but the whole `` we 're going to unilaterally attack iran 's nuclear program , despite our own history of subterfuge in developing nuclear weapons '' thing is driven by the old `` iran wants to destroy israel '' chestnut , not their support for fellow shiites ... 
  notice how i phrased all of that ? 
  i do n't necessarily believe things are exactly the way my words made them sound , but strictly speaking i simply expressed a set of facts . 
  this is what your original comment did too , in precisely the same manner and with the same degree of cynicism . 
  the whole argument is about whether / u/drboomkin was being disingenuous in his claim that the zionists had no intention to employ violence before the 1929 riots . 
  clearly they were willing to employ whatever means were necessary without any compunction from well before 1929 , ergo the comment was disingenuous . 
  you keep trying to broaden the scope of the argument , but purely and simply * that * is what we 're discussing . 
  i 'm not disputing that the arabs were opposed to the zionist colonisation of palestine or that they reacted aggressively . 
  i am literally just saying that / u/drboomkin was being disingenuous in his original comment . 
  i 'm not anti-israeli and do n't want to see israel not existing . 
  it is now the only jewish state in the world and should be allowed to live in peace , but equally if should allow others to live in peace too and i am open.y not supportive of the current situation in the occupied territories . 
  resolution of that requires trust from both sides and trust requires honesty : that is why i felt is was important to call / u/drboomkin out on his dissimulation . 
  i apologise for my last comment , it was n't an elegant argument either , but really it did capture , albeit crudely , the essence of what was going on . 
  do n't sulk now , ca n't we just have a friendly debate without things getting heated ? 
  i do n't mind this one as 457 was the grey nurse squadron before they started flying spitfires , but i do know what you mean . 
  teeth or no , it 's a great example - the mk viii was fairly rare as the mk ix was rushed into production before it was ready by mating the four-bladed prop and uprated merlin of the viii onto a mk v airframe . 
  the viii was actually a better aircraft though and very nice to see in the flesh . 
  i have pictures of it flying , but taken with a phone so not good enough to post . 
  i saw pictures of that and was n't into it either , but were n't those pictures of the two lancs flying together in england brilliant ? 
  i do n't know actually ... 
  interesting fact about the norden bombsight : [ all the crosshairs were literal hairs from one lady ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_babnik_brown ) . 
  there are definitely decal sets for it . 
  i think getting part for b-17s would have been relatively easy , unfortunately :(, 
  nope , it literally means `` death to spies '' !, 
  no , actual organisation - even better it literally translates as `` death to spies '' !, 
  yeah i was very jealous of that - i live in australia and we have a couple of lancs here - one in my city , [ perth ] ( http://www.raafawa.org.au/museum/avro-lancaster#!lancaster_01_6 ) and another at the australian war memorial ( [ g for george that flew the 2nd highest number of missions of germany ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/g_for_george ) ) , but neither fly !, 
  i went to canberra at easter and saw g for george - i have pics of both that and s for sugar ( the highest number of missions lanc at raf museum hendon ) , here they are : [ s for sugar ] ( http://imgur.com/82igjm8 ) and [ g for george ] ( http://imgur.com/rx8pxce ) !, 
  not the best pics sorry , museums are hard to get clear shots in sometimes ... 
  you guys are lucky to have that typhoon over in canada atm . 
  edit : added links, 
  yes , i know - you 're 100 % correct ( and only missed out ogpu ) . 
  the article mentioned smersh documents too . 
  smersh is an acronym literally meaning death to spies , but it was rolled up because it became too well known - did n't its functions get absorbed by the the kgb whereas the cheka , nkvd , gpu and so on were more concerned with internal dissidents ( obviously they were interested in spies , but their main role was applying `` the terror '' is what i 'm getting at ... ) ? 
  or did the gru take up smersh 's role ? 
   you mean the iranian general that israel did n't know was in a hezbollah convoy ? 
  the same hezbollah that is currently at a state of cold war with israel ? 
  the same iranian general advising hezbollah for that war ? 
  ok . that 's definitely israel starting the violence . 
  i was actually referring to hazbollah that 's fighting isis in syria ( whose ally al nusra 's fighters are treated by israeli doctors and whose enemies - iran and hezbollah - are bombed by israel ... ) and is n't currently fight israel and indeed has n't since 2006 . 
  great , could you provide a link please ? 
  i literally do not know how to use google and in any case whenever someone makes a claim ** they ** should be ready to back it up , not just say `` oh , it 's on the internet '' . 
  a lot of things are on the internet and not all of them are true ( or pleasant to view for that matter !, 
  i 'm not the other guys that replied to you , mate , and i already told you : i literally do not know how to google !, 
  come on guv , take pity on a poor digital cripple and provide a link . 
  please . 
  i 'm sure they did . 
  this is directed to all the guys of reddit : ** 96 % ** !!!, 
  come on guys , we can do better !, 
  how do you think this makes those poor women feel ? 
  with just a little effort i * know * we can fix this - let 's all reach out and literally touch that lonely 4 % who must feel just awful being ignored while all their sisters get attention , unwanted though it may be !, 
  what do we want ? 
  equal harassment for all women !, 
  when do we want it ? 
  now !, 
  what i find mildly interesting about this is that wineries are * still * releasing bottles with corks instead of screw caps which are cheaper and ca n't become corked . 
  what 's interesting about it is that - like the `` cheers '' branding on the cork top - it 's a marketing thing . 
  no expensive wine uses corks anymore because people do not want their expensive wine to get ruined by the cork or oxidisation , but marketers have found that cheaper `` plonk '' type wine sells better when packaged with corks because people buying cheaper wine perceive that wine * should * have a cork ...
