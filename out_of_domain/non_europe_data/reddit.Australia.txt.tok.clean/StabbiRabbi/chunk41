  also the fundamental truth remains and is still that - intentionally or not - by bombing anti-isis fighters , the idf assists isis in their fight . 
  so apart from those two points - and my third and final one which is that it 's not israel 's intention , just a side effect of their actions - what does n't hold water ? 
  edit : order of arguments, 
  so if the release of prisoners makes one player in a conflict another player 's biggest aid giver are israel then hamas 's biggest aid giver ? 
  of course not , but that 's the type of sophistry you 're applying ... 
  to phrase this in common / r/worldnews idiom , you 're mounting a whataboutism on a strawman - `` what about syria '' and then trying to argue that i 'm saying israel is deliberately helping isis . 
  i ** keep saying ** the aid that israel is providing isis is an ** unintended side effect ** of their acting in what they seem to consider their own interests , by attacking hezbollah and iran within syria . 
  meanwhile isis are being kept out of the golan heights by hezbollah and iran who are much more concerned with fighting isis ( who want to slaughter them all as apostates ) than israel , with whom hezbollah has n't been at war since 2006 !, 
  so it would seem that the idf 's actions which have ** unintentionally ** helped isis speak more of their own chimerical fears than any military necessity . 
  look at the [ recently photographed hezbollah drone airstrip ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/50922/hizbullah-airstrip-revealed ) , positioned to deal with isis , not israel !, 
  is israel right to be cautious of hezbollah 's long term intentions ? 
  perhaps , they have a long history of conflict since hezbollah formed in the context of the [ brutal sabra and shatila massacres in which idf troops were complicit ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre ) and the subsequent battles that led to the withdrawal of the idf invasion force from southern lebanon . 
  are hezbollah are current danger to israel ? 
  i would say no as they are now defending themselves against isis !, 
  does idf bombing of hezbollah help isis ? 
  of course it does . 
  is that the intention ? 
  no , i would say not . 
   actually , it 's you who are . 
  not me . 
  childish man , very childish . 
  how so ? 
  i illustrated what you were doing with an example - you just resorted to finger pointing . 
  ( `` i know you are , but what am i ? '' ), 
   fsa and jan also keeps is away . 
  you forgot about that . 
  true , i had n't mentioned it , though that 's not to say i was unaware of it . 
   so what ? 
  i can post photos of where hzb murders captured fsa fighters , so in a sense they also aid is . 
  that is also true , but still a true whataboutism . 
  speaking of which :, 
   oh look at all this what-about-ism . 
  how is describing the long history of conflict between hezbollah and israel - in the process of explaining why i can understand the idf 's mistrust if not their outright paranoid persecution complex about it - a whataboutism ? 
  i 'm not saying hezbollah good/israel bad , rather , as i already mentioned ( i repeat myself because your comprehension is somewhat lacking/intermittent it would seem , or , more likely , selective ) , i am putting the long history of conflict into context . 
  it 's just what happened and does explain why israel are nervous of a resumption of fighting , even if hezbollah are looking elsewhere currently . 
   and are hezzbollah defending themselves ? 
  i thought they where from lebanon , not syria ? 
  correct ? 
  because then they 'd be considered a invasion force . 
  ah so forward defence is not acceptable in syria . 
  to employ an actual whataboutism ( because i 'm interested directly in your response ) * what about * the west bank ? 
  you 'll note i have dealt literally point by point with ** everything ** you said , not just some cherry picked samples that ignore the `` hard '' parts . 
  i 'd like to see you do the same for my previous post - this one is too easy because all i have done is respond to you ... 
  we can all only hope i guess, 
  this is just going around in circles - you keep pulling the same tricks trying to muddy the waters and derail the discussion from the single , salient point that you claimed `` held no water '' - that idf bombing of hezbollah ** indirectly ** assists isis !, 
  so far you have utterly failed to provide that . 
  we can keep accusing each - with some truth - of employing the same tricks and fallacies , but all that does is serve your purpose of removing the discussion further and further from it 's starting point . 
  all i said originally was that idf bombing of isis 's enemies unintentionally helps isis . 
  i did n't put any spin on it , it was just that and that is still utterly irrefutable . 
  lol , ok , way to give up on a fight you ca n't win . 
  the difference is that your argument does n't remotely disprove mine , but is merely an absolute classic whataboutism , albeit one with a bizarre surrealism that is intended to make mine appear equally incoherent . 
  the reason for that is exactly what you actually highlighted yourself - i discussed actions being continuously undertaken despite their unintentional , but completely foreseeable and proven , side effects - whereas you talk about ludicrous intentional effects . 
  hence why my argument is perfectly rational - rendered so by the `` continuously undertaken despite their unintentional , but completely foreseeable and proven side-effects '' factor - and far from stupid , whereas yours is intentionally both of those things . 
  diversion from uncomfortable truths is a common , but rather facile tactic in these threads and it is that that i should have called you out on immediately instead of almost getting dragged into it !, 
  ooh now we 're getting down to ad hominem attacks . 
   that is so fucking cute . 
  the only one who gave up was you when you made the ` we 're going around in circles ' apology when faced with your own rationale of forward defences and support of is . 
  i was n't apologising for myself , i was dissecting your methods when i brought that up . 
  your arrogance and lack of self-insight must make you quite insufferable in real life if this is how you behave when not behind a computer screen . 
  not once have you acknowledged any of the inconvenient truths i have raised , preferring to simply double-down on the argumentative , aggressive rejoiners . 
  compare that to my perfectly calm and reasonable responses ... 
   now cite me one line where i go on with this whataboutism then ? 
   so what ? 
  i can post photos of where hzb murders captured fsa fighters , so in a sense they also aid is . 
   so would you argue that the saa then is the biggest aid giver to is in this fight then ? 
   the same syria that emptied it 's prisons of radical salafis to strengthen is and discredit the opposition, 
   fsa and jan also keeps is away . 
  you forgot about that . 
   so israeli bombings on the golan on hezzbollah could just as much be argued as a strenghtening agains is as it helps fsa ? 
   disjunct affirmation that israel supports is/aq bears just as much rational thought that saa is is biggest supporters seen to them buying oil from them and releasing their salafi scums from prisons . 
  enough ? 
  the last one also illustrates the strawman nature of your argument . 
  i am simply saying that israel 's repeated bombing of hezbollah and iranian fighters have a perfectly foreseeable and proven ( by the casualties to the is forces bombed ) ** side effect ** of helping isis - never that israel * supports * aq/isis/jan or whoever else . 
  like the idf bombing the iranian and hezbollah fighters in syria to fight isis you too are fighting a chimera here . 
   okay . 
  for the sake of continuing this argument until you understand my point ; how is it rational ? 
   is me saying saa is directly supporting is rational ? 
   to most people it would seem like a very irrational statement . 
   now how is mine argument different from yours ? 
   explain . 
  i already explained that , but i can tell from the foam-flecked standard of your language that you are n't rationally comprehending everything i write so i 'll repeat myself for your benefit ( again ... ) :, 
  your argument - as you admit , saying the saa ( or the idf for that matter ) are * directly * supporting isis is clearly nonsensical and irrational . 
  saying that keeping on bombing hezbollah and iranian fighters from an ( at present ) unnecessarily aggressive sense of paranoia is * not * irrational . 
  you . 
  now ? 
  or do i need to devolve my sentences into shorter ones comprised solely of single-syllable words for you ? 
  i 'm happy to do so , but i do n't think basic intelligence is your problem , it 's more to do with a dogmatic refusal to budge even a milimetre from any of your positions or ideas . 
   what proven side effects ? 
  killing those fighters who would otherwise be fighting isis is the big one and one that the idf is happy to crow about . 
  if you read the jane 's article it does n't just show a photo of an airstrip , it actually discusses the employment and disbursement of hezbollah 's forces currently and they 're all directed at isis bar a minimal border guard on the israeli border . 
  `` but the hez and iranian fighters were heading towards the golan heights '' you say ( have said ) ; that is just a function of geography - there is only so much space ion southern syria and to fight isis the shia will inevitably have to drive in the direction of israel , or perhaps uncomfortably ( for the idf and themselves ! ), 
  close to the areas that israel still illegally occupies . 
   which is also why you totally avoided and pussied out from my question if forward defences in lebanon is ok . pussy . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you want to hear here and so i 'm going to risk going off topic to thoroughly address my interpretation - i simply ca n't * bear * leaving you calling me a pussy unanswered ( ** / s ** , lol ) . 
  israel 's justification for the '80s invasion of lebanon was forward defence , as is their military posture in the west bank and surrounding the gaza blockade . 
  in certain circumstances it is more acceptable than others - namely when , as in the case of hezbollah , you are fighting at the invitation of your co-religionists who are actively defending themselves . 
  are israel 's postures understandable . 
  yes , imo , of course they are ; however , there is of course a hefty caveat in the form of the nature of the implementation of that posture . 
  becoming involved in the lebanese civil war is understandable as it brought great instability to israel 's northern border , but clearly idf troops facilitating shatila and sabra by securing the area for the phalangist troops to enter and massacre ( then standing by and watching , despite exercising complete military control ) the mainly poor southern lebanese shia and/or palestinian refugee residents was not less understandable than hezbollah fighting alongside shia , druze and alawite ( all apostate in the eyes of jan/isis/salafist / wahhabi/etc thugs ) syrians ( surely as an obvious student of this region 's conflicts you understand the relationship of the lebanese civil war 's events to the gestation of hezbollah btw ? ) . 
  we agree that the west bank settlements are illegal so need to even touch that aspect of it , but the idf siege of gaza is another understandable , if somewhat heavy-handedly implemented , instance given hamas 's proclivities and position on israel .
