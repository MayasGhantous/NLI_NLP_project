  so in short , imo , forward defence is of course acceptable , depending ( again of course ) on context and execution thereof . 
  i am not trying to say everything israel does is wrong or bad and hezbollah are perfect little unicorn-riding pacifists . 
  nor am i trying to say israel has a policy of deliberately assisting and providing direct support to isis/aq . 
  ** what i am saying is merely that by bombing isis 's enemies the idf unintentionally , but completely predictably , does , de facto , provide assistance to isis as a side effect ... **, 
  the only addendum , elaboration or qualification i attach to that very simple point is stating that - at present , not ten years ago or ten years from now - there is no need for such an aggressive mentality towards hezbollah on the part of the idf . 
  of course defending israel is their job , but this kind of lashing out born of self-absorbed/self-obsessed paranoid psychopathy is actually self-defeating ( as it is in many other instances i sha n't go into now as * they 're not what we 're discussing * ! ), 
  finally let me just say that on public forums you are not going to find that everybody is going to always share your own opinions , beliefs and values . 
  that does n't mean there is no validity in what they have to say . 
  i have not denigrated your obvious pro-israeli stance per se , merely your manner of expressing it . 
  i have admitted where you are right personally and where i consider the israeli/idf pov to be justifiable , reasonable or even just understandable . 
  i do n't think ( as i have said many times ) israel bad/hezbollah good - the world is much more nuanced than that . 
  i do n't get any pleasure from arguing with you and am not trying to attack israel or you personally - i simply expressed a bald statement of fact into which many readers put their own biases and bugbears to interpret as me saying `` israel supports isis hurr durr '' . 
  i never said that and do n't believe it to be true . 
  however , i ca n't stand being hectored by would-be bullies determined to shut down any dissenting voice that dares to raise an opinion different from their own . 
  the downvote brigading is bad enough , but man , you just wo n't let it go and so i keep responding to your aggression . 
  i doubt that i will change your stance an iota , but hopefully reasonable people will read our conversation and see what i am driving at and be motivated later to also dare stand up to those that wo n't allow that israel is perfect and allowed to act as they please . 
  bloody american tourists ... 
  it makes a lot of sense for such ships to carry sufficient missiles in a vls to provide itself with a degree of air defence capability and even some oth offensive capability sufficient to allow themselves to at least operate without too great a supporting fleet . 
  one would hope this is being considered already ; as a few sub members have noted , such ships risk becoming very vulnerable white elephants without any organic self-defence capability and in the absence of sufficient escorts : eg the canberras . 
  it 's interesting that the french carry astor sams on the cdg ( as mentioned in the article ) , but not the mistrals . 
  the decision seems strange considering the cdg carries an air wing of rafales and hawkeyes and thus has a better defensive capability innately . 
  what about the case of the canberras , for example ? 
  ( as an australian i am quite cognisant of their , and the ran 's capabilities . ), 
  the ran does n't possess a massive air warfare capability , especially right now when the canberras are in the commissioning process . 
  a vls would be very useful to allow them to be used more independently out of the box . 
  there are only 8 anzacs and will only be three hobarts - the adelaides are rapidly ageing and due for replacement . 
  the us can afford to keep its lhds in a battlegroup - australia ca n't . 
  the danger is that we end up with two large , vulnerable capital ships that ca n't be practically employed due to insufficient support . 
  any defensive solution would ideally have its own fc , at least to some extent , that could then be networked whenever possible . 
  of course , the canberras provide a useful capability in and of themselves and the likelihood in a serious shooting war is that the ran would operate as part of a coalition ( as it did in both world wars , korea , vietnam , gulfs i & ii and etc ) , but some ability to take care of themselves without needing a significant proportion of the rest of the fleet would be nice . 
  the idea would be to do just that , not develop some kind of hybrid . 
  that failed utterly for the soviets to the point that all of missiles were eventually removed from the kiev class ships ( iirc ) . 
  a vls battery is a very different proposal from taking up 1/2 of the deck with launch tubes though ... 
  - flight of the intruder is a good vietnam-era naval aviation movie ;, 
  - the aviator is a howard hughes biopic ;, 
  - behind enemy lines is set in the former yugoslavia about a shot down us pilot ... 
  it 's tragic is n't it - so many beautiful planes shoved off the sides of ships and dumped in the oceans , buried in pits or just chopped up into pieces and melted down . 
  for that matter it 's a shame what happened to so many of the steam locomotives too ... 
  paid internet shill is already a growth area . 
  so you * are * bettering yourself right now . 
  and none of you can speak english such that any native english speaker can understand a word you say ... 
  it 's not just the current government either - the opposition are a bunch of union thugs with social policies nearly as ( centre ) right as the `` liberals '' and no idea of how to run a budget and other than that it 's bloody jacqui lambie or the motoring enthusiasts party ... 
  the whole economy is way too dependent on primary production ( farming or mining ) with next to no industry left and not enough tech/sciences ; meanwhile the unis focus on selling degrees to overseas students and how to screw as much money out of aussie students as they can when they get full fees ... 
  and the bogans , my god , there are so . 
  many . 
  bogans ... 
  i guess the tanks are probably still in ok nick even if buried though at least . 
  looks like a nice collection - i 'm in australia and recently visited the australian war memorial and [ temora aviation museum ] ( http://www.aviationmuseum.com.au/ ) which were both good . 
  i was in the uk at christmas and went to raf museum hendon and will be back later this year when i 'll probably hit up duxford . 
  they 're all great to visit . 
  that ai n't no path , that 's the goddamn ho chi mihn trail !, 
  what about the improvements they trialled on the perth ? 
  is n't that a scanned array system ? 
  will they provide any greater air warfare capability ? 
  obviously the anzacs are just frigates , but hopefully the new systems will give them a bit more punch . 
  i prefer the term `` consumerism '' to describe the same thing , but i get what you mean and am on the same page . 
  so much focus on consumer crap ; not enough on people or `` the country '' and nobody cares while so much is lost so long as they can watch it happen on a big , flat-screen tv ... 
  australia , where men are men and sheep are n't afraid ... 
  we suffer from a massive infestation of kiwis here and i can assure you most - though admittedly not all - are utterly unintelligible . 
  of course , when exposed to normal vowels they do eventually evolve , but when they 're fresh off the boat you sometimes ca n't understand one word in five !, 
  perhaps you have had lived overseas ? 
  had some kind of speech therapy ? 
  or maybe you 're just one of the `` norms '' ? 
  are you * sure * your american friend understands you ? 
  have * they * lived in nz maybe ? 
  these are all possible answers . 
  ( btw , i 'm kidding - you guys do sound odd , but of course we can understand you !, 
  most of the time at least . 
  i love nz too , going back for my 3rd trip next easter . 
  sorry about the sheep crack too - it 's an old joke , but i could n't resist it ... ), 
  yeah , except now they 're [ only building 12 of them now and are having massive developmental issues ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2015/04/07/t-50-pak-fa-new-problems/ ) too , so much so the the indians - the main financial backers of the program - are thinking of withdrawing ... 
  yep , i 'd like to - very politely of course - tell lindsay to piss off right to her smug , suburban , `` basic '' ( remember * that * - is it still a thing ? , anyway , for lack of a better word ... ) face . 
  not literally tbh , i 'd just give a wide berth without hyperbole , but ava sounds way cooler . 
  martin sounds like a smug prick as well btw and he i really could punch . 
  that 's just me of course - ymmv, 
  `` but , but hamas put weapons in un schools and fired from them so we were right to shoot at the civilians !, 
  it 's not * us * that 's to blame '' says every apologist ever itt ... ( my prediction - this is the first comment . ), 
  ** yes they did ** , but ** not the schools being used as shelters ** - the weapons were ** fired from and stored at other , empty un schools . 
  both sides are in the wrong here - the idf has adequate reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities to differentiate between schools being used as shelters and empty buildings being used to launch rockets and hamas are evil for risking lives for using ** any ** un building as part of their military efforts . 
  if the idf does n't possess adequate technology then they should acquire it before bombing schools , but i would be very surprised . 
  heat sensors and etc are very basic kit these days as is a persistent surveillance capability , both via drones , of which the idf is a master user . 
  and so it goes on . 
  edit : cleared up some wording to make my meaning perfectly clear . 
  the books are great too - really good fun to read , although i must say richard sharpe is not in the same class as his british army antecessor [ harry flashman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harry_flashman ) , who has adventures in many similar parts of the british empire ... 
  i 'm a massive fan of them both - very similar adventures , but flashman is side-splittingly funny . 
  would 100 % recommend !, 
  it 's impossible to know exactly how it happened , but what happened is very clear as this report makes explicit . 
  which is exactly what did n't happen here if you bother to read the article . 
  the salient points are ( as i know that 's a lot to ask when you can just write such gems as your comment without even bothering to do so ) :, 
   the inquiry found that more than 40 palestinians had been killed and more than 200 others wounded while sheltering at united nations schools and other facilities in the gaza strip in the summer of 2014, 
   it also said that weapons had been found at ** three ** empty un schools in gaza , and that there was evidence to suggest that palestinian militants had `` probably '' fired from them . 
   the summary cited the case of one un girls school that was hit by 88 mortar rounds fired by the israel defense forces and another that was hit by an israeli anti-tank round . 
  in reference to yet another girls school , the report 's summary said '' ** no prior warning had been given by the government of israel of the firing of 155 mm high explosive projectiles on , or in the surrounding area of the school . 
  i saw the last flying example in the world flying over easter - let me get home from work and i 'll past a picture in the comments if you 're interested ? 
  well , if it 's good for the goose ... 
  israel do n't need no ~ ~ dirty ~ ~ clean civilian nuclear power !, 
  having seen agent orange 's victims whilst in vietnam , i can attest the tragedy they have suffered . 
  i visited an orphanage where kids who had been born with agent orange deformities lived and it was pretty heartbreaking . 
  at least the us government has , started paying compensation to vietnamese victims , but the sums involved thus far seem inadequate . 
  veterans too are heavily affected by conditions resulting from exposure to dioxin - the whole thing is one of the worst legacies of the war given that most of the other lingering effects are passing or have long passed .
