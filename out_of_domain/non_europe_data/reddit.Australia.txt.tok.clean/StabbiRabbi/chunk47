  other than that i 'd say opportunities are fairly similar . 
  young people suck . 
  given that they did n't say they 'd revised the number of pak-fas they 're planning on building this plan will leave them with 12 pak-fas and 60 + tu-160s . 
  that 's an interesting force mix . 
  i was being sarcastic , should have put a / s, 
  no worries - plain text is terrible at conveying sarcasm/irony , lacking all the other non-verbal cues like expression and to one as it does ... 
  the other thing in this case is that i guess had anyone out there been credulous enough to believe every ( or any even , heh heh ) of the claims made in the article for the pak-fa , that person would probably genuinely believe that 12 of them and 60 odd copies of a beautiful , but  30 year old bomber ( albeit no doubt updated with some glonass kit and the same [ gefest svp-24 ] ( https://rostechnologiesblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/su-24-bombers-equipped-with-gefest-sighting-system/ ) navigation/targeting system as the su-24ms and tu-22m3s ) * would * be an appropriate force structure ; how were you to know you had n't found that guy ? 
  that 's not a croc , [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saltwater_crocodile#/media/file:crocodylus_porosus_feeding_frenzy_by_gregg_yan_01.jpg ) is a croc !, 
  where can one find this mythical `` good recruiter '' irl ? 
  how does making `` anti-feminism '' illegal help the good fight against anti-semitism/holocaust denial ? 
  i think your best approach would be to hire a programmer . 
  that explains things . 
  ca n't wait for the pictures of isis to start hitting this sub in 25yrs time ... 
  let me guess - the burrito was bought to satisfy severe munchies ? 
   anangu have a responsibility to teach and safeguard visitors to their land . 
  what visitors call ` the climb ' is of great spiritual significance to the local anangu . 
  the climb is not prohibited , but anangu ask as visitors to their land that you respect their wishes , culture and law by ** not climbing uluru ** . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/uluru-and-kata-tjuta/uluru-and-kata-tjuta-national-park/can-i-climb-uluru ), 
  let me guess - you 're not suggesting that the solution is entirely that israelis lose out in favour of the people whose land they stole , are you ? 
  thank you , you just answered my question perfectly clearly . 
  how are they * that * different ? 
  the ira were pretty brutal in their day - not just in their terrorism , but also in regards to aspects of their behaviour such as policing unauthorized criminal activities on estates where they operated by kneecapping joyriders for example ... 
  they are more similar than they are different . 
  what ? 
  your answer literally does n't make any sense . 
  i merely thanked you for confirming your bigotry and you respond with a complete non-sequitur . 
  another shining example of the israeli educational system !, 
  ugh , i 'd rather have the one i posted wrapped around my foot than * that * thing !, 
  well , they were n't shy about executing people they did n't get along with either . 
  it 's a question of degrees is all . 
  actually reading through it i see that you 're correct - your answer is n't a non-sequitur . 
  i just was n't expecting such a blatant admission of bigotry which led me to misinterpret what you 'd written . 
  my apologies - i withdraw the entire comment . 
  and you ca n't understand them when they talk ... 
  source : australian , surrounded by kiwis everywhere . 
  well g ` day from wa then ( if yer a sheila ... ), 
  it 's * always * anti-semitism, 
  everybody is entitled to their opinion, 
  boohoo , sux to be you, 
  the word `` aborigines '' is in itself considered racist , due to its paternalistic connotations , by australian aboriginals who prefer to be be referred to by their tribal group name or `` aboriginals '' if referring to the entire race across the country . 
  your ignorance on this matter clearly highlights the ignorance expressed throughout the entirety of your shitpost and marks you as a troll . 
  which bastion of enlightenment to you hail from that you feel so comfortable criticising australians so thoroughly ? 
  myth of solomonaic/davidic israel proved !, 
  lol ... 
  i actually agree that there most probably is some historical basis to many biblical stories and that it is really very interesting when historical evidence is found ... 
  unfortunately most archaeological `` evidence '' does n't prove anything in anything other than the most general sense , but is nonetheless immediately used to support ideological ends !, 
  as an interesting confirmation of the general verisimilitude of the biblical story this is fascinating , but it does n't prove solomon existed per se was what i was getting at . 
  i think he meant pot , not meth, 
  edgy, 
  i think she wants to make it to / r/photoshopbattles, 
  so it 's * not * that the idf is n't keen on fighting an enemy who will actually fight back , thereby risking the lives of their conscript thugs who are more comfortable shooting kids throwing rocks than diehard jihadis with heavy weaponry ? 
  i was referring more to isis ... 
  do n't do lsd man , that will drive you crazy . 
  do meth instead , it 's just good clean fun . 
  lol - you 're funny, 
  what do you mean `` you people '' ? 
  oh come now , 64 % of jewish voters gave their vote to parties that do not support a two-state solution , as / u/meteorblade so [ elegantly outlines above ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3a5lex/israeli_justice_minister_said_gearing_up_to_sue/cs9xuan ) . 
  64 % is very nearly 2/3 - ie twice as many jewish israelis voted for parties that oppose a two-state solution as voted for parties willing to work towards one ... 
  what is the rest of the reason then , in your opinion ? 
  you seem to think peace is irrelevant in all this ; if i may be frank with you i must admit i think you 're deluded about that ... 
  who are `` reddit 's anti-israel brigade '' ? 
  joint list is arab - that straight away removes 13 of your seats ( he referred to jewish israelis ... ), 
  the discussion was about why the israeli public put a `` no deal '' government in power . 
  within that context your prevarications are meaningless . 
  this is a clear effort to delegitimize western journalists - they should take a leaf from ayelet shaked 's playbook and sue !, 
  ( not that israel pays any heed to international law when they 're applied to israel ... ), 
   the nazi swastika , one of the most powerfully-enduring symbols of anti-semitism and religious and ethnic hatred , has been present in hundreds of attacks against buildings , synagogues , cemeteries , and private homes over the past few years, 
  i 'm sorry , but whilst i understand seeing a swastika painted on a synagogue must be very distressing and that doing so is a deplorable act of bigotry , it scarcely compares with burning a church down . 
  when you consider that hundreds of these attacks were such highly offensive , but non-violent actions and that buildings , cemeteries and private homes are included in the us total , your assertion that israel ( whose total given includes only for actual attacks against places of worship , not such events as the [ vandalisation of palestinian property by extremist settlers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_settler_violence#attacks_on_palestinian_agriculture_and_property ) for example ... ) is doing better utterly laughable . 
  in short you are comparing apples and oranges . 
  another sense in which this is the case is that painting a swastika is the act of a retarded juvenile bigot , whereas burning a church is the act of an violent terrorist ... 
  edit : forgot part of a sentence . 
  i wonder if that 's why i was downvoted without even any attempt to answer my comment 's points ? 
  i have to say i appreciate your openness and honesty ; so many pro-israeli lie about their true opinions , but you just say what you think . 
  if you read the article some certainly are * much * worse , but of the seven hundred listed `` hundreds '' were `` just '' spray paint . 
  i put the `` just '' in quotation marks because i am not trying to downplay the distress that such hateful vandalism causes ... 
   the nazi swastika , one of the most powerfully-enduring symbols of anti-semitism and religious and ethnic hatred , has been present in hundreds of attacks against buildings , synagogues , cemeteries , and private homes, 
  straight out of the link provided by / u/tarywhatever, 
  the problem is rather an over abundance of sources : every single one of the links in that results page refers to swastikas being sprayed on synagogues . 
  the worst other damage that is mentioned is broken windows ... 
  how about you find a definitive source that `` many '' of the attacks were worse than merely spraying swastikas ? 
  actually , you kicked this off with :, 
   however many of the attacks that / u/tayaravaknin would have found are far more than simple acts of spray paint . 
  aaaand we return to the original source that stated :, 
   the nazi swastika , one of the most powerfully-enduring symbols of anti-semitism and religious and ethnic hatred , has been present in hundreds of attacks against buildings , synagogues , cemeteries , and private homes, 
  to complete that quote , from the original source :, 
   in september 2007 , for example , a massive swastika , the size of a football field , was carved into a new jersey cornfield . 
  i think given that phrasing and the evidence of the google results the onus is on you to show that they actually went any further . 
  the example they gave specifically mentioned the marking of a cornfield with a swastika , indicating that was a particularly egregious incident ... 
  they listed more serious incidents that involved violence individually below the paragraph i quoted . 
  as i said , at this point the onus really is on you to support your claims with more than a supposition that they just did n't bother to mention the worse aspects of such incidents in a document specifically written to decry such incidents occurrence , but just limited themselves to outrage over painted swastikas !, 
  the israeli government is therefore still offering financial incentives to move to settlements built on palestinian lands , exactly as / u/cikafiumph postulated , whether they offer similar incentives elsewhere or not . 
  whether or not the assistance is offered elsewhere it 's still a significant element of why it 's cheaper to live there and does demonstrate that the government it providing incentives to illegal settlers . 
  this is an important fact to note in and of itself . 
  however , not everyone * everywhere * in israel get these benefits , do they ? 
  therefore it is still a government incentive to move to the west bank and thus an important * component * of why living there is cheap . 
   someone blindly defending israel ? 
  er , actually yes , you are . 
  every single comment of yours i have ever read is israeli apologia . 
  * your * hatred for palestinians is blinding you .
