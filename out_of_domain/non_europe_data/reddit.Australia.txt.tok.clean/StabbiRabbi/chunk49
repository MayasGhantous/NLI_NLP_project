  why should he get to stay here just because he feels like it ? 
  if he wanted to stay there is a clear pathway towards achieving permanent residency and then citizenship . 
  unfortunately the vast majority of israeli youth identify as right wing so , whilst it means that thurston moore certainly made the right decision , i doubt it will cause many of them to give thought to * why * he did n't play . 
  instead they will just brand him as an anti-semite and move on . 
  well do n't make a complete cunt out of yourself by commenting on threads about australian politics based on some book you read in uni instead of easily researched facts ... 
  hah , idf supports isis confirmed !, 
  i 'd imagine they 'd be something [ like this ] ( http://palsolidarity.org/2015/06/palestinian-home-and-market-attacked-by-settlers-from-beit-hadassah/ ) ... 
  i have seen footage of haredim shouting at and attacking western reporters filming christian religious services in churches in jerusalem , saying `` get out , get out - this is jewish land '' ... 
  they * admit * to the fsa , but also indicate that they are supporting other groups ... 
  it 's very interesting that they do n't explicitly * deny * supporting isis , is n't it ? 
  if you read my posts i think you 'll find i am very well informed regarding the issues and historical background , albeit possessing a different perspective on these than you . 
  you think this is my first reddit account ? 
  initially i made one pro-palestinian comment from my old account , now deleted , and received 30 downvotes ; i also noticed that the pro-israeli comments in the thread were all receiving 30 upvotes . 
  this was a pattern i could see recurring through many , many threads as my indignation at the blatant lies and propaganda being pushed into the comments of any palestine/israel thread grew . 
  so , just as you say you do , i started to express my opinions on the truth of the matter so that other people reading would n't be misinformed by the pro-israeli lobby 's dissimulations , disingenuous diversions and outright lies without another viewpoint to make them question the trickery ... 
  just as you say is the case with me , i know you will never question the morality of israel 's actions in gaza and the west bank - no matter how many civilians are killed by the idf , no matter what effect the blockade has on the citizens of gaza you are certain of israel 's zionist destiny and will never be swayed . 
  you are right that the brigading does push the pro-israeli narrative to the top of the comments ; however , so much of it is so transparent that it has the exact effect on others that it had on me , exactly as i describe . 
  ultimately the truth will out . 
  a morally bankrupt regime can not survive for ever - whether we are talking about hamas or likud . 
  outside of the us much world opinion is closer to mine than yours , not from anti-semitism as you would no doubt assert , but outrage at the horrors of the occupation and disgust at israel 's hypocrisy and sanctimonious bullshit . 
  tell me please , why is the death of an israeli any more tragic than the death of an israeli ? 
  i have no problem with israel , it 's existence or it 's populace . 
  i do dislike the actions of the ruling regime and the idf , especially as pertains to palestine and am mistrustful of the idf 's propaganda campaigns . 
  they are almost certainly making veiled reference to the al-nusra front who - although not allied with isis - are also fighting isis 's main enemies ( other than the kurds ) , hezbollah and iran . 
  by helping to degrade hezbollah ( with whom israel has not fought for ** 9yrs ** ) / iranian combat capability ** in syria ** in this manner ( as well a via direct air attacks ) they certainly indirectly assist isis ... 
  i have no prejudice against the israeli nation or people , just netanyahu and his gang of right-wing cronies and their tools in palestine : the idf . 
  if you bothered to read my comments properly the wording should make that clear , as should my pro-israeli comments made when i feel an israeli action deserves support . 
  it goes back to before my personal memories , but their actions whilst supporting the christian phalangists in the lebanese civil war are the very start of my mistrust of the idf ; however , more recent events such as their deliberate targeting of un schools being used as bomb shelters during their most recent assault on gaza - as detailed in the un report and supported by the bts reports ( i know you 'll say `` the un hates israel , that report means nothing and bts are funded by foreign countries to make israel look bad '' , but ultimately the casualty figures also speak for themselves ) and the systematic way such events are lied about and efforts made to manipulate public opinion by the idf 's propaganda/information warfare arm have had a much more of an immediate impact than such distant events ... 
  please explain how they 're glaringly wrong , except for your not agreeing with them ? 
  did n't israel start the '67 war ? 
  if you honestly do n't believe palestinians are worth less than israelis you are alone amongst your ilk . 
  how then do you justify the massively disproportionate palestinian civilian casualties vs israeli civilian casualties or the discriminatory and illegal policies regarding settlers vs native inhabitants in the west bank . 
  i really do not think bds will grind to a halt , no matter how many hissy fits israel throws either btw . 
  your question was why i do n't trust the idf . 
  i think my argument shows why . 
  israel may not directly support isis in terms of a formal alliance , but let 's step though this logically :, 
  - in the above article the idf are almost certainly making veiled reference supporting to the al-nusra front who although not allied with isis are also fighting isis 's main enemies ( other than the kurds ) , hezbollah and iran ;, 
  - by helping to degrade hezbollah ( with whom israel has not fought for 9yrs ) / iranian combat capability in syria in this manner ( as well a via direct air attacks ) they certainly indirectly assist isis ... 
  trying to patronise me and burying your manipulations of the truth in massive walls of text do not magically nullify your own massive prejudice and bias . 
  when did israel last fight a near-peer ? 
  i 'll tell you : 1973 . 
  it is fair enough to draw inferences from people 's publicly stated positions : it is merely your own bias that blinds you to the possibility there may be some truth contained in my comments . 
  of course we 're both biased , but i am no worse than you ... for example your assertion that there is `` no such thing as a native inhabitant '' completely ignores the fact that palestinians who have been displaced were living there for generations prior to israelis deciding that they 'd like the bit of land the palestinians had been inhabiting and taking it . 
  you are more blinded by your ideology than i am by mine . 
  the jordanians and syrians attacked israel because israel attacked their ally egypt . 
  european jews abrogated any connection they may have had to the land by leaving for 2,000 years . 
  if you believe they have some residual right to it that merely reveals the intransigence of your ideological beliefs . 
  similarly your interpretation of native is coloured by those same beliefs . 
  by your definition `` native '' americans are not actually native either because they were preceded by the clovis cultures . 
  the english are not the natives of england , germans of germany and so on ad nauseum . 
  indeed by your definition only australian aboriginals could be considered native . 
  does this mean you believe no other group on the planet has the right to leave peacefully where their ancestors have long lived without any arbitrary group of foreigners being free to impose themselves as the zionists did upon the inhabitants of palestine ? 
  surely by that measure i , as an australian , should be free to gather up a group of australians and supplant the present day israelis ? 
  that 's not to say i do not understand and empathise with the desire for a homeland for the jews , especially given the terrible , unfair and unjustifiable oppression they have faced over many years living within other cultures ; however why do they deserve to keep expanding what they have already gained and eroding any opportunity for the people of palestine to enjoy the same . 
  this is why i argue for a single-state solution at this point - the israeli right constantly undermines the viability of a palestinian state so why not break with the two-state solution thinking that is just resulting in endless war and the complete erosion of any kind of israeli moral authority and start over with a new vision of two peoples working together to share the land they both inhabit ? 
  after all do n't current israeli arabs enjoy full rights , leading productive lives as citizens of israel ? 
  why not just allow their population to encompass their currently stateless ( as you put it ) cousins ? 
  hang on , you ca n't have it both ways : israel attacked egypt despite egypt being in the process of standing down their forces . 
  if israel 's aggression was justified so is that of syria and jordan ... 
  the zionist colonial project has had a terrible impact on the pre-existing inhabitants of palestine ; furthermore early zionists were perfectly cognisant that conflict would arise from their immigration policies and ready to engage in it . 
  the intention was most definitely threatening to palestine 's existing people and economy . 
  to quote ze'ev dubnow , writing at the time of the first aaliyah :, 
   `` the ultimate goal ... is , in time , to ** take over ** the land of israel and to restore to the jews the political independence they have been deprived of for these two thousand years ... 
  the jews will yet arise and , ** arms in hand ** ( if need be ) , ** declare that they are the masters ** of their ancient homeland . '', 
  [ emphasis is my own ], 
  now to quote you :, 
   i trace natives back to the oldest existing inhabitants of the land . 
  if that is where my definition leads , so be it . 
  i do n't mind any of those things . 
  the palestinians are indubitably the natives of palestine by your own definition as the oldest existing inhabitants of the land prior to the very recent zionist influx . 
  recent settlement growth may have been slow , but in absolute terms the growth of israel at the expense of the people we both agree are the natives has been very fast and extremely aggressive ... 
  perhaps if the palestinians were not so oppressed their support for terrorism would abate ? 
  i believe it would rapidly . 
  i do not wish to see the destruction of the jewish population of palestine , merely a fair sharing of resources and an equalisation of opportunity to live peacefully and prosper . 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  cheers . 
  i 'm not at all opposed to immigration , merely those who break the rules at the expense of those who follow them ... 
  your efforts to patronise and thus belittle me do more to denigrate your arguments than to bolster them . 
  i think it 's `` cute '' that you 're so defensive that feel compelled to adopt this tone in reply after reply : obviously you are aware of the specious nature of many of your arguments and how flimsy many of your manipulations of the truth are . 
  i certainly did choose which parts of my quote to highlight to emphasise what i wanted out of the quote , but what is wrong with that ? 
  i did n't at all alter the substance of what was said and such thoughts were not expressed by dubnow alone . 
  i chose wikipedia because it is the least controversial , publically available source and as such the least likely for you to claim as biased . 
  you could not , so you chose to try to patronise me instead . 
  regarding the '67 war , if i may quote wikipedia again :, 
   nasser began massing his troops in two ** defensive lines ** in the sinai peninsula on israel 's border ( may 16 ) , expelled the unef force from gaza and sinai ( may 19 ) and took up unef positions at sharm el-sheikh , overlooking the straits of tiran . 
  israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the straits would be considered an act of war , or justification for war , and nasser declared the straits closed to israeli shipping on may 22 -- 23 . 
  on may 30 , ** jordan and egypt signed a defense pact ** . 
  the following day , at jordan 's invitation , the iraqi army began deploying troops and armored units in jordan . 
  they were later reinforced by an egyptian contingent . 
  on june 1 , israel formed a national unity government by widening its cabinet , and on june 4 the decision was made to go to war . 
  the next morning , ** israel launched operation focus , a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the six-day war . 
  so egypt was preparing to defend itself and israel viewed that as a cassus belli ? 
  were the same logic applied to gaza then hamas 's actions become perfectly reasonable - a notion i would not agree with and would be surprised if you did either . 
  `` ah '' you say , `` the actual cassus belli was the closure of the straits of tiran '' . 
  ok , let 's see what wikipedia has to say about that :, 
   despite this , according to major general indar jit rikhye , military adviser to the united nations secretary general , the accusation of a blockade was `` questionable '' , pointing out that an israeli-flagged ship had not passed through the straits in two years , and that `` the u.a.r. 
  [ egyptian ] navy had searched a couple of ships after the establishment of the blockade and thereafter relaxed its implementation '', 
  in any case , surely if such a blockade is a cassus belli then hamas is again justified in their actions , are they not ? 
  again i do n't think hamas are justified and would be amazed if you did ... 
  regarding `` existing '' inhabitants - if the european jews did not live in palestine they were certainly existing , but how were they inhabitants ?
