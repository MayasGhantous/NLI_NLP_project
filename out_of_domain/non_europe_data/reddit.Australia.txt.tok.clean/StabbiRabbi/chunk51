  obama may have his own website , but so does anyone else who wants one . 
  did you see the three blog posts linked to from that page - `` 5 reasons to attack iran '' , `` there is no security in the iran agreement only danger '' and ( my personal favourite ) `` torah + tech = [ red heifer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_heifer ) '' ... ? 
  and yet still israelis on reddit deny that many amongst their compatriots are warmongers who intend to destroy the al-aqsa mosque at the first opportunity ... 
  obviously the first two refer to warmongering - how is `` 5 reasons to bomb iran '' * not * warmongering ? 
  it is only the 3rd blog linked to that is connected to the destruction of al aqsa . 
  the red heifer is required as a ritual sacrifice necessary to build the 3rd temple on the temple mount which would require the destruction of al aqsa seeing as it 's currently occupying the spot the red heifer breeding madmen want to build upon . 
  have you ever considered that just maybe it is things like red heifer breeding programs that underlie the muslim 's reluctance to give jewish worshippers open access to the temple mount ? 
  and a completely disproportionate response - an air strike into the middle of the most crowded urban environment in the world because a single rocket that :, 
   exploded in an open area of the hof ashkelon regional council , causing no physical injuries or damages . 
  somehow you think this makes the israelis look like they 're justified in their actions ? 
  seriously ? 
  i 'm not defending the firing of the rocket , but the bombing was surely a greater crime in the scheme of things . 
  i bet that bomb did n't, 
   explode in an open area , causing no physical injuries or damages . 
  edit : i did n't want to comment on that act of brutality because when all 's said and done , what is left to say about such terror bombing into civilian areas by the idf or the equally vile , albeit less deadly , terrorist rocket attempt ? 
  of course the pro-israeli crowd are going to downvote this to hell and crow about the whole sequence of events , but what i found interesting was the foaming at the mouth blog posts that were linked to from next to the article . 
  they were what was most interesting so they were what i commented on . 
  where does it say the rocket was even shot from the civilian area they clearly ( from the photo ) targetted ? 
  it does n't . 
  it states :, 
   the israeli air force launched an airstrike against a terrorist infrastructure, 
  ( what * is * `` a terrorist infrastructure '' btw ? 
  i guess that means gaza generally as a terrorist infrastructure is ** not ** a point target , but a , well , infrastructure . 
  did they just * admit * it was a random bombing into gaza there ? ), 
  even assuming that the above quoted sentence is merely an appalling abuse of the english rather than an admission of collective punishment and assuming they hit a specific target , what was that target 's connection to the rocket ? 
  randomly bombing civilian cities when not in an explicit state of war against a state is certainly a war crime . 
  much more so than firing a rocket into a field . 
  er , why did n't they * say * that they bombed the launch site then ? 
  in fact most of the time the rockets seem to be launched from open areas , leaving nothing more than a patch of slightly scorched earth . 
  what would be the point in bombing that long after the terrorists have left ? 
  until this story came out the same could be said for netanyahu and his cronies too , unfortunately ; now both parties seem to be making some effort . 
  surely that should be encouraging and encouraged ? 
  if we are to acknowledge that the israelis are behaving well at the moment , then we must do the same for the pa ( although not , of course , hamas ... ), 
  destroy [ these ] ( http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/palestine/qassam-launch.jpg ) ? 
  really ? 
  i am not justifying the rocket being shot . 
  how does writing :, 
   equally vile , albeit less deadly , terrorist rocket attempt, 
  equate to justifying the rocket attack ? 
  stop making up strawman arguments . 
  i think hamas are just as bad as the idf in terms of their efforts to attack civilians ; the idf are just better at it . 
  there is no justification for terrorism , whether by a terrorist organisation or a state . 
  ( `` it 's not terrorism '' , you say smugly , `` it 's self-defence ... '' i bet it 's pretty fucking terrifying being in gaza where that bomb was dropped and not just for the terrorists - if they were even anywhere near where it landed ... ), 
  lol , how did i justify terrorist activity ? 
  please , explain . 
  this is an awful crime , but not terrorism . 
  how am i defending terrorists ? 
  this is not terrorism . 
  yes , they are twisted , evil people for picking on an old man and no doubt they chose him because he was weaker than they and so an easy target for them ( meaning they are weak themselves ) ; however , it is still just a crime rather than an act of terrorism . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  i 'm not defending them - i hope they receive the full measure of punishment the law is able to deliver . 
  language matters though , what people say , how it is said and what is really meant each have their own significance and it 's important to use language properly to tell the truth , not corrupt the meaning of words to suit some purpose or other ... 
  i think you make a very valid point . 
  many people who would otherwise sympathise with the situation israel is in ( including the historical circumstances that led to the creation of israel in the first place as well as the current security situation ) lose that sympathy in the face of netanyahu 's unapologetic bigotry and right-wing posturing . 
  by `` defending israelis against the world which is full of anti-semites '' ( as i 'm sure he would see it ) he in fact creates a huge groundswell of anti-israeli sentiment that then , sadly , spills over into actual anti-semitism in some . 
  the fact is that a peaceful settlement to the palestinian conflict is in the best interests of all people in the region , yet netanyahu is personally a massive blocker to such a settlement in and of himself ... 
  ... then capitalise on the ensuing outrage by saying `` look , the world hates jews , you 're not safe in < insert western country  ; come , move to israel where i protect all the people ( note : all the people excludes arab israelis ) '' . 
  it 's so destructive in the big picture and serves only his own political ends . 
  i really fail to see how it actually helps israeli or israelis such as your friends - the decent , reasonable mass of people who are just trying to get on with life ... 
  if he goes full psycho trying to derail the iran deal by attacking obama via an overt effort to subvert the us political process i really think he could do the people i mention above some serious harm by damaging israel 's relations with the us seriously enough that the mistrust he engenders outlasts his rule . 
  i honestly hope that does n't happen because an israel that is truly isolated is in nobody 's best interest . 
  ( except - perhaps - perversely his own . ), 
  edit : netanyahu must take comfort from his fanclub here in / r/worldnews !, 
  i criticise him personally and him alone and * that * gets so many downvotes in such a short time ? 
  it 's really very interesting ... 
  it 's not just one comment , it 's his entire attitude towards the settlements , the peace process , iran , the west ... 
  the only time he makes any concessions are for short term political gains when he has pushed too far and feels exposed politically . 
  i do n't know whether your comment was informed by your own unconscious attitude , ignorance or disingenuity , but netanyahu 's ultra-nationalism is only a symptom of his deep rooted bigotry which is the real reason he makes outside observers cringe . 
  why can an hindu man not convert to islam ? 
   a grave sin, 
  i see what you did there ... 
  it 's the obvious answer - in both senses ( ie to my question and to the issue at hand ! ) . 
  it * should * be able to work both ways , but sadly that 's not the way such deeply rooted cultural and religious traditions tend to function , is it ? 
  evidently deciding how to refer to the eastern empire following the fall of rome such that everybody agrees on the nomenclature used is somewhat of a byzantine problem ... 
  still we live with the disastrous after-effects of communism 's 70yr reign over eastern europe ... 
  like bitcoin ? 
  it 's not specifically a byzantine generals problem though ; more like a general byzantine one, 
  wow , what a truly bizarre analogy . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you came up with that all by yourself ? 
   the only ~ ~ democracy ~ ~ apartheid state in the region * led by a right-wing madman and constantly bombing neighbouring countries whenever they feel like it * has nukes ? 
  ~ ~ i 'm okay with that ~ ~ that 's absolutely terrifying . 
  ftfy, 
  people who are n't generally ... 
  and which is a signatory to the npt , so what exactly is your point ? 
  how could i ** not ** get it ? 
  the guy 's iran right ? 
  and israel owns the first handgun , so that 's the israeli nuclear capability ( very discreet , only taken out when they their life 's in danger - but oy vey , how often does a man with a victim complex * think * that ? ) ... 
  after that though it starts to unravel quite a bit ( this is a straight question , no analogy : do a man 's writings reflect his mental state ? ) . 
  how do you apply sanctions to a guy ? 
  and why would you give a guy nuclear weapons ? 
  if he already had a `` handgun '' ( nuclear weapons in the analogy , right ? ), 
  why take it away and give him a `` nuclear bomb '' ? 
  what - in the analogy - is a `` nuclear bomb '' if a handgun is nuclear weapons ? 
  see what i mean ? 
  it 's just a truly bizarre analogy . 
  does . 
  not . 
  make . 
  any . 
  sense .
