  i mistyped a single word , which i did n't even try to go back and cover up , and that 's why i ca n't, 
   really expect me ( or anyone for that matter ) to be able to take you seriously, 
  this is just another example of both your moral blind spot ( surrounding whether or not israel has the right to occupy palestine ) and your repeated personal attacks/ad-hominem / `` negging '' ( love your vocab too btw , interesting that you choose that word given its origins ... ) . 
  how have i refused to respond to your questions ? 
  i answered every one of them ... 
  you just do n't like the answers . 
  - without funding an intifada is almost inevitable . 
  you may feel safe behind your `` protective barrier '' , but a lot of people 's lives would be negatively impacted by such an event . 
  the occupation is extant purely because israel wants it to be to further israel 's colonial project . 
  why should the eu pay the cost ? 
  - this question has been rephrased to differentiate it from the previous one , but essentially the answer is the still the same as i gave above . 
  in short the occupation exists due to israel 's will , so why * should n't * israel bear the cost ? 
  - answer is exactly the same as for the first and second questions ... israel is protected from the effects of its occupation by the eu 's money . 
  if you split one question into three , but still get the same answer to all three parts then it 's the same question , and i have provided all those answers previously - you just do n't like them . 
  i see you had a post removed too btw ... 
  it is apartheid within the west bank where * illegal * settlers get significantly better legal protections than the indigenous inhabitants ... 
  if only because although they may be israeli citizens they 're not actually living in israel when they settle in the west bank . 
  israeli laws should not therefore apply , especially not when they discriminate against the native inhabitants . 
  i think that would be entirely fair too, 
  not if the same laws apply to both groups , then no - of course not . 
  it 's only apartheid when different laws apply to different groups living in the same place , but differentiated by some factor such as race or religion . 
  * that 's * apartheid . 
  it 's funny how only pro-israeli commenters use words like `` judenfree '' . 
  i mean although we all know what is the intended meaning , it does n't actually make any literal sense , being as it is a portmanteau of words from different languages that has never actually been used previously by any oppressors of jews . 
  it is rather another appeal to the ongoing victim complex that drives and `` justifies '' so much of israel 's egregious aggression against any who dare disagree with whatever it is that israel feels like doing . 
  it 's all a bit sad , as in pathetic , actually ... 
  without meaning to justify the greek 's action , if turkey did n't both have highly porous borders allowing refugees to transit through their lands easily and help create refugees by aiding isis militarily and economically whilst also bombing kurds perhaps there would be a more sympathetic view of turkey , do n't you think ? 
  why not leave the palestinians , iranians , lebanese and etc alone then ? 
  why keep taking more and more of the west bank ? 
  bombing hezbollah as they try to fight isis ? 
  trying to derail the iranian nuclear deal to the point of being willing to start a war over not getting israel 's own way in relation to said deal ? 
  does any of that seem like the actions of state that just wants to be left alone ? 
  anything except israel giving a little ground in any way it would seem from your response ... 
  hezbollah and israel have n't fought since 2006 ; hezbollah are currently entirely focussed on isis . 
  they were also created in the midst of the turmoil of the lebanese civil war , turmoil which israel contributed to greatly , to defend against israeli and israeli-supported phalangist attacks on the shia of southern lebanon . 
  i love how this whole mess is the palestinians fault in your view for not accepting the peace deals and offers of a state that have been so very generously presented to them by a magnanimous israel . 
  even though israel has continuously expanded beyond its original borders and continues to do so . 
  even though the state offered is equal to what israel insists on keeping either by size based on demographics or by access to resources ( eg water ... ) and even though it is israel who are the colonial invaders who unilaterally declared themselves masters of the land those arab families had lived on uninterruptedly for centuries at least , no matter whom their nominal ruler !, 
  your statement on gaza is not even worth responding to . 
  the whole thing ** is ** a sad situation . 
  peace ** should ** happened 70 years ago . 
  and if not then , then it should have happened in the 90s . 
  that it did n't is not , however , entirely the fault of either side , but a result of hubris from both 's leaders . 
  your whole both post is imbued with a sense of the righteousness of israel and ignores the possibility of israel accepting any compromise . 
  given the truths contained within the article we are discussing israeli compromise does seem improbable , but it is not impossible and not unreasonable to expect . 
  world opinion - even amongst overseas jews - is swinging very strongly against israel , not as a nation , but in terms of its government 's policies . 
  the eu have declared their intent to enter the peace process - as israel 's largest trading partner the sanctions they will enact should israel not shed its arrogant stance will have swingeing effects on the israeli economy . 
  even in the us opinion is turning against israel over netanyahu 's arrogance regarding the iran deal and his efforts to interfere with the us 's internal political processes over it . 
  the worm is turning , and not in israel 's favour . 
  this is indubitably why we have seen the recent rash of concessions such as punishing jewish terrorists , changing the rules of engagement for soldiers so they can no longer kill just because a situation makes them feel a bit nervous in the occupied territories and limiting illegal settlement expansion . 
   at this point anything that stops the needless bloodshed and war would be welcomed . 
  i agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment , but i think our interpretations of what `` anything '' includes are likely to be quite different ... 
  you did n't ask me mate . 
  i was just commenting . 
  you 'll have to pursue / u/hpymondays for the answer you seek . 
  my take on it though , if you 're interested , is that gaza had been in egyptian hands and the west bank in jordanian hands following the collapse of the ottoman empire , the cessation of the british protectorate and all of the shuffling of borders that ensued ; however , no matter whom their nominal masters the palestinian families who lived/live on the land had done so for centuries at a minimum , perhaps millenia ... 
  they had enjoyed a natural connection with the land that was unbroken for that time , despite the vicissitudes of empire , until it was violently broken by an influx of colonial , european jews who were following the precepts of the zionist movement . 
  whilst the motivations for the zionist movement are perfectly understandable and easy to sympathise with given the list of horrors inflicted upon the jewish peoples in various places at various times and particularly , of course , the holocaust which relatively immediately preceded the creation of israel , suffering those abuses does not confer the right to pass new abuses onto a different population . 
  especially one that was as entirely disconnected from the sufferings of european jewry as arabs living in palestine were . 
  this makes your question moot as , just as with the jews themselves , the arabs of palestine had not had the opportunity to exist as a state until very recently . 
  ( the concept of the nation state per se is itself a relatively recent phenomenon . ), 
  the crux of the issue is that they have just as much right to self-determination as anyone else , just as much right to enjoy the lifestyle they choose to live on the land their families have occupied for generations and ( though this should n't even need saying ... ) the same rights as anyone else to the basic human rights and freedoms currently denied them by the occupation/blockade . 
  perhaps then the question should really be who has a greater natural right to the land ? 
  that answer would of course be the palestinian arabs . 
  israel is now israel and i am not arguing that there should be no homeland for the jews . 
  rather i am just arguing that the palestinians deserve one just as much . 
  imo the best option would be for israel to withdraw to the '67 borders and a reparation/development package worked between israel , palestine and the international community . 
  i would agree with all you have written , with * perhaps * the sole exception of the first two sentences of the first paragraph . 
  with the entire remainder of your comment i am in complete agreement . 
  in fact it very closely reflects my own perspective on the matter . 
  sadly though getting rid of the extremists is more easily said than done ; however , my hope is - as yours firmly appears to be - that through a negotiated , fair settlement process the moderate masses on both sides will overcome the lunatic fringe . 
  that was a great comment - it 's all too rare to see a moderate opinion in this sub . 
  i misread your position by a mile from your previous comment - or perhaps you fell , as i did in my reply , to the polarising effect the lack of moderate voices creates in here . 
  either way it was great to read this comment to which i am replying now . 
  damn right - those females who so foolishly pursued positions of authority despite their genetic unsuitability to sustain that ill-gotten authority should get their shoes off , get pregnant and get back in the goddamned kitchen !, 
  that 's what you 're saying , right ? 
  edit : i need to add a ** / s ** , do n't i ? 
  that all seems pretty reasonable , from my perspective . 
  give and take from both sides . 
  of course i 'm a wasp australian who has no personal investment or real voice in this issue , but i could certainly see what you just proposed working and would judge it to be fair . 
  all the jews i have known here have been very liberal/left-leaning , although some lose that when it comes to anything to do with palestine/israel and i have always understood that a lot of the population in israel thinks similarly ... 
  it 's definitely the leadership on both sides that is the problem - i mean , when it comes down to it most people just want to get on with their lives in peace and prosperity rather than fight . 
  fighting only benefits the leaders who get to stay in power and reap the associated benefits as a result of the conflict they perpetuate . 
  everybody knows hamas would have no justification for existence if there was peace , that netanyahu only won the last election because of his fear-mongering rhetoric and how corrupt abbas is . 
  if israel wishes to join nato a prerequisite is no border conflicts , but if the palestine issue was settled then they would be in that position . 
  what 's happening in syria does not really involve israel ( yet ) and i am sure an accommodation could be arrived at hezbollah . 
  you do n't think they gained any experience with tough prisoners during the troubles ? 
  no shit - and then there 's the $ 3b or so that goes to those other bastards next door who trample on human rights just as badly , if not worse ... 
  especially since , in addition to getting the cash , they use us weapons to bomb civilians ( in gaza too ) . 
  ah man , what are you going to do ? 
  until israel can be brought to heel the situation just has to be managed as best as possible . 
  there was violence on both sides of the border ... 
  this kind of behaviour is not exactly unprecedented in u.s. / israeli relations . 
  the crazy thing is that anyone would think threatening their ally because you disagree with them on a particular is a constructive move , let alone likely to help you get your own way . 
  these are both guys with extensive experience of what apartheid really means , no matter what semantic games supporters of israel 's current policies like to play ... 
  what about [ rampant israeli settler violence ] ( http://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence ) ? 
  have you never heard of [ price tag attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/price_tag_policy ) ? 
  [ final link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_settler_violence ) in case you 're still unconvinced, 
  so pretty exactly the same as the only confirmed me nuclear power is the only one to ever inspect its own nuclear facilities ... 
  ... `` he 's my mom 's gardener '' ...
