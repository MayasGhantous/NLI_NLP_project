  unlike your own ? 
  that 's practically all trump 's saying too amigo ... 
  maybe if israel showed some honesty and marketed all their oranges as `` blood oranges '' no matter if their flesh is red or orange people would be less inclined to boycott them ? 
  i think it 's largely the refusal to accept responsibility for their behaviour that * really * offends ... 
  edit : wrong word, 
  no need to shout . 
  i 'm not saying you are literally trump , just you and he would doubtless get along very well so long as you confined your discussion to immigration policies ( as long as you did n't mention your nationality of course !, 
  ) ; i guess my real point is though you get all hot under the collar at the very thought of mexicans being blocked at the border , but want muslims swept out of the country you 're just visiting . 
  you really ca n't see * any * parallels in the two scenarios ? 
  if you genuinely ca n't that goes a long way to explaining why people do n't want to spend time around you . 
  it 's sarcasm , yahweh . 
  and that seems wildly inaccurate . 
  so you want norway to be like, 
  but you disagree with his policies being enacted in the us ? 
  what does israel have to do with `` western civilisation '' though ? 
  it 's a typical me country , not a western style democracy except on a very facile level . 
  do you mean israel is unfairly criticised because it * claims * to be a western-style civilisation despite being a me state ? 
  so effectively israeli cowardice and incompetence ( deaths from incorrect use of biological/chemical warfare kits ) killed more israelis than the missiles themselves . 
  does anyone else see the parallels with gaza ? 
  this is yet another example of exactly how self defeating the constant israeli victim false narrative actually is . 
  meanwhile this `` good faith offer '' will be paraded by pro-israeli redditors from here till eternity as yet another instance of when the palestinians `` could have had peace '' to justify not only the ongoing oppression , but also the slaughter that you quite rightly identify as ensuing ... 
  it 's sickening . 
  well , it was certainly a home for jews for a few decades here and there in between diasporas * thousands of years ago *, 
  who notoriously lack any kind of moral compass so just lap that kind of shit right up, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  in fact i have learned , from reading / r/worldnews , that the un exists * purely * to unfairly criticise israel ... 
  there are n't many people saying that israel should cease to exist and the fact that you read that degree of hyperbole into his comment is highly demonstrative of the entire israeli victimhood false narrative that he * is * talking about . 
  all most people want is for israel to end its egregious human rights abuses against the palestinians and let them enjoy the same rights that israel claims for itself ; the corollary to that wish is that israel ends its hypocritical propaganda about being a bastion of democracy and starts acting as other democracies do and ceases functioning as an apartheid state ... 
  that is all his comment contains and were israel to start acting thusly almost all criticism would cease . 
  from googling `` apartheid '' :, 
   ( in south africa ) a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race . 
   segregation on grounds other than race . 
   `` sexual apartheid '', 
  in the context of israel it refers particularly to the situation in the west bank where the illegal settlers live under israeli laws whilst the native inhabitants live under strict military laws , but also refers more broadly to such inequalities as arab israelis suffer , as insidiously subtle and virulently denied by israeli propaganda as those inequalities may be ... 
  do you need me to explain this further or can you do your own research ( hint : google ) from here ? 
  let 's never forget the olive trees either , hey / u/tayaravaknin ? 
  how many articles/comments that portray simple facts about israeli actions get suppressed daily ? 
  go look through the `` controversial '' tab and it 's immediately apparent . 
  in this case israel 's actions are so egregious that the pro-israeli downvoters were simply unable to suppress the moral majority 's natural outrage ... 
  it 's not about jews , it 's about the israeli regime 's criminal actions . 
  how did i repeat myself ? 
  your comment makes literally no sense . 
  i 'm not surprised you 're choosing to duck out though since you 're getting downvoted : israeli cowardice is well evidenced by the idf 's use of guns and tanks to deal with kids holding pebbles and netanyahu 's recent directive to shoot those kids in the back ... 
  i 'm sorry , but that does sound just a little bit racist , which is something i do n't think you actually are . 
  the implication is that arabs/bedouin are incapable of constructing sound buildings and are happy with hovels - ie that they are mere primitive savages . 
  many bedouin no longer live a nomadic lifestyle , in large part due the enforcement of national borderlines across the areas which they traditionally would have moved . 
  he does have a point . 
  the jews i am friends with almost all tend to be very liberal about everything except israel . 
  unfortunately there seems to be a perception amongst many non-israeli jews that it is taboo for them to criticise , or even think critically about , israel and these otherwise enlightened individuals turn into the type of rabid nationalists that one associates with israel , spitting hatred and venom about palestinians , the un and etc. . . 
  of course this is not true of all jews , but sadly a majority do conform to this behavioural pattern . 
  lovely people in all respects except their unthinking support for israel despite the evils of that country 's regime . 
  whether or not you or they ** call ** yourselves americans you both ** are ** americans though . 
  those ' 00 , '01 and '08 offers were never intended to be accepted though , were they ? 
  just as netanyahu recently `` offered a peace deal '' ( this week , last week ? ), 
  that was clearly never going to be accepted ( settlements to stay , israeli control of palestinian airspace , no palestinian defence force and etc - the usual bullshit ) the game is that israel magnanimously offers those dastardly palestinians peace , but they just wo n't accept it ; however , the `` peace offers '' are designed to be politically unacceptable : in short the whole thing is a charade used to further the israeli victimhood false narrative , right ? 
  or have i got something substantively wrong ? 
  i 'm not following you around , please do n't include me in your persecution complex . 
  you comment endlessly in every thread about israel/palestine , a subject i am also interested in albeit as an impartial observer who seeks merely to bring some balance to these discussions . 
  we 've engaged in discussions over many months now and it 's inevitable that we will cross paths . 
  most of our discussions have been interesting and occasionally you have illustrated a facet of a situation i had not considered previously ; i 'd hope the same is true for you . 
  most of our conversations have been civil and interesting - so it 's not that i 'm `` following you around '' , but rather that we share the same interests , if not opinions , and our comments to and fro are a natural outcome ... 
  i hope you are sufficiently open minded to be learning too . 
  it most certainly does not !, 
  that would be absolutely ghastly if people claimed english heritage simply because they have learned to mimic our language !, 
  all those dreadful americans alone . 
  the very thought makes me shudder . 
  uh , is n't that what the nsa is for ? 
  let 's not ignore the men 's role in this - irresponsibly eating * chinese food * and using cell phones !, 
  of course they end up doing bad things . 
  that kung pow chicken will fuck a young man up !, 
  that 's not how it works in india unfortunately . 
  the most likely legal recourse will be for the victim 's sisters to be raped by ten men . 
  quicker , no cc fees , allows skimming of the till before declaring earnings for taxman ... 
  no , it 's just more confirmation that israel are the bad guys . 
  every time they sell military hardware to countries like russia or china it invariably includes u.s. technology that there is no way in hell the u.s. would sell to those nations ( eg lavi fighter tech from f-16 shared with china , drone tech to china and now russia - the list goes on ... ), 
  it is highly indicative of israel 's attitude towards their part in the `` alliance '' with the u.s. - basically take all they can and screw the u.s. 's interests if it suits them . 
  russia is currently sanctioned by the u.s. yet israel feels free to sell them weaponry , this despite their histrionics over iranian sanctions . 
  lucky guns are so readily available in the u.s. !, 
  natasha from rocky & bullwinkle !, 
  this needs to be x-posted to / r/iamverysmart, 
  gilgamesh is interesting , containing the biblical `` noah 's ark '' flood story , but within a much more ancient text, 
  no , no , no !, 
  then rising inflation will destroy the country , if not the world . 
  or something . 
  definitely . 
  he actually says as much :, 
   hewitt : and if israel acts unilaterally against iran because they view this deal as so bad , will you unequivocally stand by the action of the netanyahu government ? 
   trump : of course , i will . 
  in fact , he 's a friend of mine . 
  i did commercials for his reelection . 
  and according to what he said , i 'm the only celebrity , he 's used the word celebrity , this was a while ago , that did commercials , that he asked to do commercials . 
  but he 's a good man , and i would absolutely stand with him . 
  yay iran war 2016 !, 
  so in india is the idiom for going to the the toilet `` earning a rupee '' instead of `` spending a penny '' ? 
  i think it 's that when in india these previously sheltered saudi diplomats are exposed to cell phones , jeans and chinese food for the first time and - naturally - this type of thing is the outcome ... 
  thank you for clarifying things for those who have n't seen this `` explanation '' ; it was a story in both / r/worldnews and / r/nottheonion yesterday and i was banking on people having seen that , but of course not everyone will have prior knowledge even with that ... 
  iranian posturing aside , the highly analogous [ first kingdom of jerusalem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_jerusalem ) crusader state only lasted approximately 100 years before saladin overran almost all of its territory ; it 's not hard to imagine israel suffering a similar fate , especially given the regime 's leaders like netanyahu and their propensity for aggravating conflict for cynical , often personal , political gain and alienating the country 's erstwhile allies ... 
  i 'm not wishing this outcome on israel - i think my support for the state 's existence is well established by now - and hope things get worked out before it occurs , but if , at the very least , the criminal actions in palestine are n't reined in i fear it is an inevitability . 
  `` or latinos ... '', 
  i do n't know , netanyahu seems pretty healthy .
