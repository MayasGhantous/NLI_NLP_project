  i reckon he easily might last longer than another decade , more 's the pity . 
  also , it 's the evil fuckers that seem to live forever . 
  and netanyahu is nothing if not the personification of pure evil . 
  how is my username any indication of my priorities ? 
  you read too much into incidental bs - i challenge you to read my comment history and find a single anti-semitic comment or one that advocates anything other than israel giving the peace process a fair go ( with both palestine and iran ) and treating the palestinians as israelis expect to be ( and are ) treated - ie end the apartheid policies in the wb , end the human rights abuses and killing of innocent civilians and end the illegal occupation policies ... 
  i may be critical of the israeli government ( and particularly the cartoon-evil netanyahu ) , idf actions and israel 's deplorable behaviour regarding palestine and the associated hypocrisy surrounding said behaviour ; however , i completely support israel 's reasons and right to exist ( within the '67 borders ) , i never offer any support for hamas and i never criticise the israeli people or nation per se ( merely the government and its policies together with those policies effects ) . 
  i actually have jewish friends , colleagues and business associates ( including some in israel ) for whom i have the utmost respect and liking . 
  were the palestine situation to be resolved and israel back down on its paranoid efforts to subvert the iranian diplomatic process and efforts to degrade their ( and hezbollah 's ) combat effectiveness whilst their fighters are battling isis my criticism of israel would cease immediately . 
  indeed you will find comments that support israeli actions when i feel they are deserving of recognition and support . 
  i am well informed regarding the history of the region and never post any facts that are not incontrovertible ( of course my opinions are a different matter , but we 're all entitled to our opinions and have every right to express them on reddit ) ; i am no knee-jerk bigot . 
  i quite like being called `` notorious '' , but do hope you were n't referring to me as a `` shill '' ? 
  that is a banning offence on this sub you know and i 'd hate to have to make a complaint about it !, 
  you will notice i also post to many other subs and that my comments on other subs and indeed any topic except israel/palestine are generally well received - otherwise i would have negative comment karma as so many of my posts regarding israel/palestine are routinely downvoted to oblivion no matter what i actually say , due no doubt to my `` notoriety '' ... 
  i have had many very balanced and civil conversations with several very pro-israeli redditors ( those who are willing to engage in discussion instead of merely parroting propaganda and lies ) . 
  it is these types of discussion that i seek and most enjoy ; unfortunately they are hard to find because those who comment in this sub tend to be highly polarised and nuanced , balanced opinions are often ignored or indeed negatively received by a lot of commenters who are only interested in pushing their own agenda . 
  i am actually open to having my opinions changed and am always grateful to be exposed to differing viewpoints or information that i did not previously possess or only had a single perspective upon . 
  i often apologise when my comments are wrong or i feel my buttons are being pushed aggressively and it turns out i have misread the comment to which i am replying 's intent . 
  it * is * possible to criticise israeli actions and policies without being critical of or holding any dislike towards israel you know ? 
  i am actually a fairly disengaged and relatively impartial observer . 
  am i frequently critical of things the israeli government does ? 
  yes . 
  am i anti-israeli ? 
  the whole situation is not black and white and i try to present an alternative viewpoint from the prevailing comments that regularly dominate such threads . 
  some of my comments may tend to be a little more simplistic and stark than my actual complete opinion , but that is due to polarised nature of this sub 's comments that i mentioned before . 
  if you are interested in discussing anything i have said that you consider particularly egregiously incorrect am i more than happy do so , just as long as your intention is not to didactically lecture me . 
  please do open a discussion - as i said it is such discussion that i truly seek on this sub . 
  i resent your implication that i am hateful and bigoted . 
  perhaps if you read my comments instead of mindlessly downvoting you would learn the inaccuracies of your prejudices . 
  perhaps it is not i who is hateful and bigoted ? 
  i missed out on reading the deleted comment and apologise if i misread your comment and you were n't accusing me of being a shill . 
  on the other other hand it is somewhat of a stretch to conjure my, 
   insinuating that your comments are being targeted by some organized cabal, 
  from my innocent remark about my regularly being downvoted for daring to speak my opinions honestly and truthfully in this sub !, 
  please do n't drag me into your persecution complex . 
  there are both pro- and anti- israeli redditors in this sub . 
  i am neither , but rather an impartial observer who merely calls it as i see it on a case-by-case basis . 
  is that supposed to be some kind of attack on your own ridiculously laboured efforts to turn these people 's legitimate efforts to protest their illegal oppression by the illegal occupation forces of the idf into some kind of argument for the legitimacy of israeli actions , or are you seriously trying to attack the palestinians right to protest ? 
  in other words it is legitimate to protest oppression ; to then try to turn such protests into a propaganda ( even if only reddit / r/worldnews propaganda ) blow against the protesters is frankly a little bit deranged . 
  yes , horrifying is n't it . 
  it shows a lot heavily armed , violent men and women behaving aggressively toward literal children - the shots of that thug hurting the kid with the broken arm were particularly disturbing as were those of the phalanx of imperial-stormtrooper-esque police all locking and loading their assault rifles in a civilian area ... 
  a little girl * touches * a `` soldier 's '' [ armed thug ? ], 
  gun whilst that `` soldier '' [ terrorising stormtrooper ? ], 
  is aggressively and unnecessarily violently attacking another child and you * criticise the little girl * ? 
  how can you watch all of that and take away :, 
   from my pov the palestinian protester families in this video are clearly trying to create a confrontation , especially at around 2:40 when the young girl touches the soldiers gun and then moments later when the family literally shoves the little boy into the soldier :, 
  really ? 
  i realise that in israel people are inculcated with extremely biased and effective propaganda from birth , but still , really ? 
  how can you watch that and sleep at night knowing that you support these actions ? 
  this russian force should at least stop israel 's wanton attacks against anti-isis assad/hezbollah/iranian forces and materiel whenever they feel `` threatened '' by these forces who are engaging isis ... 
  there is a great deal of opposition to this particular road from nimby local residents - this appears to merely be another attack vector ( environmental being the other main effort ) . 
  the road itself * is * needed to link the port of fremantle to perth 's road network without heavy vehicles having to move through densely populated suburbs with all of the negative impacts such traffic brings . 
  the issue of aboriginal sites does , however , need to be taken very seriously and carefully reviewed in each instance - there are many thousands of such sites because the aboriginal people have been here for such a very long time ( up to 80,000 years ! ), 
  and all significant sites need to be preserved . 
  deciding on the significance , however , requires a change in policy from the current system where an industry exists at the fringes of the resources industry in which ( white ) consultants get paid exorbitant rates for ( often literally ) photocopying and resubmitting previously used heritage reports . 
  tbh if the aboriginals themselves were reaping the profits i would n't find this objectionable , but the fact that it is a cabal of white professionals who take much of the consulting fees thus `` earned '' indicates to me the system needs reworking . 
  source : work in wa resources industry, 
  not to open the tomb yet though . 
  but rather conduct an exploration of what is actually in there in spatial terms . 
  it 's an important first step and exciting as a result , but not the opening we 're all waiting for ... 
  it seems we 're on different sides of the fence on this one - you appear to have an academic background whereas i work in industry . 
  perhaps this [ article about the heritage industry i referred to ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/25626180/heritage-rorts-cost-100m-a-year/ ) will clarify matters to your satisfaction ? 
  here 's a quote though , in case you do n't have time to read the whole thing :, 
   an `` industry '' of predominantly white consultants has been charging exorbitant fees for survey reports that are sometimes simply cut-and-paste duplicates , according to the state government . 
  i also feel your attitude towards aboriginal professionals smacks somewhat disappointingly of a very anachronistic paternalism that i had hoped australian society was ridding itself of . 
  just my 2c worth ... 
  you mean `` rational '' i believe , not `` rationale '' . 
  here 's the difference , illustrated by use in a paragraph :, 
  your ** rationale ** for accusing me of being mindlessly anti-israeli is due to my * username * and because i use the word `` stormtroopers '' to describe a phalanx of heavily armed , booted police who march into a civilian area carrying assault rifles and wearing dark uniforms . 
  this is not ** rational ** . 
  btw regarding the stormtroopers remark , how else would you describe them ? 
  sure they 're not dressed in white armour , but there are other precedents for the title of `` stormtrooper '' they do very closely match in appearance at the very least . 
  also ca n't you do better than attacking the semantics of my word choices rather than the substance of my comment which you skipped over in its entirety , presumably because you * do * see - as i see - armed thugs bullying crying children despite your indoctrination , and you find the resulting cognitive dissonance difficult to cope with . 
  ( i sympathise with you greatly : i would struggle trying to reconcile such brutality with an internal pov where israel can do no wrong and is engaged in defensive operations too ; it must be very confusing and as a result extremely distressing for you ... ), 
  if the next article that comes along is about netanyahu saying to the idf `` do n't shoot children with pebbles '' or `` it 's time for you to leave your stolen , illegally settled land '' to the settlers my comments will be laudatory towards israel and even netanyahu . 
  will you still downvote me though ? 
  it 's a difficult task , no doubt about , for all the reasons you mention and certainly the government/regulatory bodies involved bear a huge burden of responsibility for the flaws in the system . 
  as you say these consultants can be caught between a rock and a hard place and their work is certainly important , but i hope you did read the article and can acknowledge that my initial remarks were not mere hearsay and that not all participants in the process seem to have the aboriginal communities ' best interests at heart in certain cases ? 
  i think i do ; i just think you take yourself a little too seriously when i play with words . 
  there 's an irony in that itself , although it probably escapes you . 
  again with the semantics - you really ca n't find fault with the morality or logic of my arguments , can you ? 
  if you are interested in a genuine serious discussion i am more than happy to engage with you on such a level , but currently your selective and hyperbolic responses to cherry-picked facets of my replies give no indication that you are willing to engage in a serious conversation whatsoever . 
  i see no contradiction in my choice of words - it 's not as if those words appear in sequence or even in the same sentence . 
  i never `` insisted '' i am ** only ** playing with words ; it is quite acceptable in rhetoric to mix ironic statements with serious as appropriate and if you find the context switching difficult to understand that is your problem rather than mine . 
  are you interested in my actual , complete beliefs or only in playing silly games ? 
  if you would liked to hear my nuanced , rounded opinion on what 's going on and then offer a serious debate around that i am more than happy to provide it . 
  you still may not like all you hear , but you may be surprised . 
  if you are n't willing to listen , consider and subsequently respond from your own true mind rather than didactically state the party line by rote , however , do n't bother ... 
  do you want to talk seriously or are you happy with these word games/unable to deviate from the orthodox israeli party-line and think critically if we do talk ? 
  good on ya mate, 
  as i said , we 're on different sides of the fence here . 
  i have a lot of respect for your role and really do regard it as important ; however , i find such findings from the ernst & young audit of the industry as :, 
   the report found the average cost of a section 18 heritage application was about $ 382,800 , with $ 213,000 going into archaeological reports and $ 47,800 in ethnographic work . 
  an average of just $ 42,000 was spent on consultation with aboriginal elders . 
  somewhat disheartening . 
  i do n't think everyone who does your job is as cynical or exploitative as those people discussed in the report . 
  and as i said before , you 're right - the government does need to lift its game to ensure abuses do not occur . 
  just because mining companies make significant profits it does n't make price gouging ok . 
  i 'm not saying all consultants engage in such practices , but there 's no justification for doing so just because the client is a massive company . 
  every mining project involves significant risk and immense effort . 
  i do n't work for a mining company , but rather a company that provides services to all the big wa iron ore miners and we do n't charge according to how much they earn , but according to our standard fee structure .
