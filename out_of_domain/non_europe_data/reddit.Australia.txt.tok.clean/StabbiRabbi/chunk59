  btw : you say my comments about photocopying are not supported by the article . 
  technically you 're right , the article refers to cut and paste - the modern equivalent that requires even less effort !, 
  the exception you take to all my phrasing is merely semantics ; the body of the article supports everything i said . 
  you seem overly defensive and even a little bitter about this issue . 
  i have repeatedly affirmed the value and importance of the work you do imo , but surely the work should be about ensuring cultural sites are preserved , not merely sustaining an industry that does seem to sometimes take advantage of poor governance ? 
  why did you pick your career ? 
  was it because you saw it as lucrative work or significant work ? 
  and of course rogue states going to do rogue stuff ... 
  oh god , the bloody olive trees - this gets trotted out ** every ** time there 's any discussion about whether the pro-israeli or the pro-peace lobby has `` mastery '' or / r/worldnews ... 
  get over it . 
  that incident was a manifest injustice that captured people 's attention as being emblematic of israel 's treatment of palestinians in the illegally occupied and criminally settled territories of palestine . 
  for every `` olive tress '' thread there are 50 that state the facts about what is happening in israel/the west bank and immediately get downvoted to oblivion , plus the comment threads are usually totally dominated by supporters of the apartheid policies enacted in the wb/warmongering with iran/other human rights abuses ( eg slaughter of innocent civilians in gaza , shooting of kids holding pebbles , etc ) . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  check the number of upvotes the comment above by / u/totally _ a_banana got ( despite its surely ironic and utterly hilarious call to `` bring on the downvotes '' ) , or indeed your own count , versus / u/hemingwayford who * has * been downvoted ; for further evidence click the `` controversial '' tab ( posts with highest number of downvotes ) and see how many posts lie in there that simply talk openly about the situation in israel/palestine ... 
  yes there are both pro-israeli and critical of israel redditors and posts in this sub and either can gain the upper hand in any given thread , but to me , as an interested , but neutral/uninvolved , observer of these events it does seem that generally the pro-israeli lobby generally does pretty well at suppressing stories it does n't like and promoting those it does . 
  occasionally , however , a groundswell of genuine moral outrage will overwhelm the pro-israeli redditors capacity to suppress posts - this is what happened with the olive trees . 
  certainly there are anti-semitic bigots that post here too , but most people who are critical of israel 's actions simply want to see an end to the manifestly unjust suffering of the palestinian people and do not wish to see the destruction of israel in any way , shape or form . 
  certainly that is my position . 
  were israel to cease and desist from its oppressive policies any of my posts that may be seen as mildly critical of israel would also cease and desist to be replaced with unqualified support . 
  that way of dealing with criticism of israel 's oppression in palestine is the classic [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) / [ tu-quoque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque ) logical fallacy much beloved of pro-israeli redditors as they attempt to divert discussion from the topic at hand and into pointless dead-end `` conversations '' about whether israel is a bastion of freedom and democracy in the me or an apartheid , quasi-fascist criminal regime ... 
  try not to get into those discussions - they simply remove attention from whatever is being discussed and lead to pointless and frustrating slinging of didactic polemic which will just get you downvoted for no value to the overall discussion . 
  israel is commonly considered a rogue state because :, 
  - it completely ignores international laws ( geneva convention iv regarding the illegal occupation , apartheid policies and criminal settlement of palestine ) and standards of behaviour ( participation in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty program ) ;, 
  - it regularly unilaterally violates other countries sovereignty ( munich revenge killings , plo/iranian scientist assassinations , kidnapping of foreign citizens such as the deplorable , but argentinian citizen , eichmann from argentina ) ;, 
  - it regularly engages in unilateral and unprovoked military actions such as those against hezbollah , iranian and assad 's forces currently fighting isis - not israel !, 
  - and the threatened attacks against iran ;, 
  - it abuses its relationships with its allies such as the usa with actions such as this spying as well as events such as attacking us navy ships in international waters , stealing fissile materials from american waste dumps and using them in its illegal nuclear weapons program and selling us technology to china . 
  the things you say israel does right may be true ( you left out it allows gay pride parades for its citizens to more easily find and stab lgbt people at !, 
  ) , but they do n't cancel out the country 's misdeeds . 
  yours is a whataboutism argument and easily refuted by simply staing two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  there are many good and noble things about israel , its history and certainly its people , but unfortunately the ruling regime is not a good international citizen and it is this that raises the ire of moral individuals around the world . 
  i think paris is part of `` eurostan '' ... 
  to be fair , he has expressed an understanding of exactly that dynamic in his resignation ; however , i agree that he should be deprived of his millions of dollars for leaving . 
  let 's see how well their carrier construction plans go before proclaiming this as a great outcome for russia , shall we ? 
  they may have the technology transfers , but their industrial capabilities are severely lacking - particularly in terms of shipbuilding . 
  the largest soviet shipyard ( that built their current , decrepit , carrier ) is now in ukraine and outside of the area the russians are contending . 
  russia has not built any large ships for decades and would seem to lack the funding and industrial know-how to do so ; even with the technology transfers they wo n't be building any mistralskis without those two basic pillars in place anytime soon . 
  what does my username have to do with anything ? 
  i could take exception to yours , given the obvious insight it gives into your recreational proclivities , but i accept that usernames are just handles we all have to come up with rather than deeply thought out , highly meaningful statements about ourselves and our philosophical positions in life . 
  mine is meaningless , a simple visual rhyme that does n't even rhyme if spoken out loud . 
  it is not a statement of intent to stab anyone ; if anything it refers more to rabbis that enjoy stabbing things than vice versa . 
  your dismissal on such grounds is a childish , knee-jerk and dare i say bigoted reaction from a closed mind that ca n't accept the validity of worldviews different from your own . 
  as far a `` pro-peace '' goes , what else would you suggest i call the people who are critical of israel 's actions , but not israel as a country , concept or people ( such as myself ... ) that is n't the 15 odd words the above description took ? 
  anti-israeli is not accurate ; neither , particularly in this thread , are pro-palestinian or pro-iranian : the thread is about israel 's efforts to disrupt the negotiations with iran which are all about normalising iran 's position in the world to help ensure ** peace ** as opposed to israel 's constant calls for military action against iran , ie ** war ** !, 
  so how is my characterisation inaccurate , misleading or unfair ? 
  refusing to read my comment because you do n't like my username ( without any understanding of what it even refers to ) or because i chose a two-word descriptor instead of typing out a paragraph seems like a poor excuse for refusing to accept the truths contained therein merely because they confront your prejudices . 
  good talk . 
  edit - just a couple of quotes from my original post you refused to read that demonstrate that am not , in fact , anti-israeli . 
  these are direct quotes from my original post , which has not been edited :, 
   to me , as an interested , but neutral/uninvolved , observer of these events, 
  and, 
   most people who are critical of israel 's actions simply want to see an end to the manifestly unjust suffering of the palestinian people and do not wish to see the destruction of israel in any way , shape or form . 
  certainly that is my position . 
  were israel to cease and desist from its oppressive policies any of my posts that may be seen as mildly critical of israel would also cease and desist to be replaced with unqualified support . 
  i would n't say i have an obsession with israel ; rather it is a subject i find interesting for a number of reasons . 
  i am very interested in both history and current affairs and israel is kind of a nexus between those two interests . 
  the levant is a fascinating region and has been for millennia . 
  israel is a country that is interesting because of its contradictions - it began with the best of intentions and is populated by a people who are cultured , intelligent and have a long and interesting history of their own , yet unfortunately many actions of the israeli regime are disappointing from a moral , humanistic perspective and occasionally even literally horrifying . 
  i do not only comment on israel/palestine threads by any means , but find myself often outraged by the hypocrisy i see in comments written by the most rabidly bigoted pro-israeli redditors and feel it is important to counter the propaganda they spread . 
  if north koreans were on reddit arguing for the benign and legitimate nature of their regime i would counter their arguments too . 
  last , but not least i - like many people all around the western world - certainly empathise with the plight of the palestinians . 
  if israel would come to an accommodation with the palestinians and let them enjoy the same rights and freedoms as the israelis themselves enjoy within what was after all until very recently palestine , my criticism would cease ( there are a couple of other bones of contention such as israel 's stance on iran , but palestine is the big one ) . 
  i would still be interested in israel , but would feel free to express the admiration i hold for that country 's undoubted achievements and positive aspects instead of arguing about its failings .

  this is the best advice here - you really should speak to your gp , especially if this has been going on for a while . 
  it sounds as though you are having a tough time right now and i would imagine that your condition is a result of the stress , but only a doctor can really help . 
  your gp can point you in the direction of a specialist if needs be , but should always be your first point of contact . 
  i really hope it is `` just '' stress , but if there is a physical ailment you need to identify and treat it as soon as possible . 
  the same is true of any psychological issue , but early intervention with physical issues almost always makes a massive difference to your prognosis . 
  hopefully you are lucky enough to have a good gp with whom you have a good rapport ; i do and it certainly improves my overall quality of life quality generally , but in your case if you do have such a rapport it should help you communicate better despite your current difficulties with doing so ... 
  i really hope this passes for you and you are able to reach out to find the help you need . 
  good luck !, 
  they are indeed . 
  i too am a big fan . 
  it can be incredibly useful though when you * do n't * want to do the housework . 
  for example i always claim to be utterly incapable of using a mop effectively , a statement that has survived my past three long-term relationships unscathed . 
  i do n't know how to use a mop properly as it happens , but that 's because i have never had to learn how to due to my status as a mere male in the realm of housekeeping . 
  is it kind of cool ? 
  sure . 
  is it healthy ? 
  no , certainly not . 
  i really should be able to mop properly and have been deprived of this essential life skill by my girlfriends ' scorn of my cleaning abilities . 
  now of course this is my fault , not theirs ' , because i took advantage of their discriminatory beliefs to my own ultimate disadvantage , but the underlying issue is exactly what this article discusses . 
  i actually found reading this very moving - my feelings about my mop wielding inadequacies immediately bubbled up in a welter of grief for what i have lost as a result of this precise issue !, 
  well it 's not so much evolving into a couch-man as being organically integrated into the couch . 
  you can thus certainly aspire towards becoming a couch cyborg/bionic couch ( whichever term you prefer ) ; the best thing is it seems to achieve this dream you just have to literally do absolutely nothing !, 
  of course technological advances may mean you can assimilate with the couch of your choice more quickly than the six years it took the lady in question here , but you 'll have to ask your doctor about that - it 's a reasonable assumption , but pure speculation on my part at this point . 
  lube and practice . 
  you can work on it by yourself by placing objects of increasing size into your anus as you go about your daily life - start with something that fits comfortably and just keep using larger objects each day . 
  i do n't listen to it because the people i see who do are all dreadful little spotty teenage oiks or aging [ bogans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogan ) that invariably need a decent shower , a shave and a haircut ; put simply i do not like anything else they enjoy so i find it hard to imagine i 'd ever enjoy the music they love no matter how hard i tried to acquire some kind of tolerance to it . 
  hang in there brah - life 's tough for you with all that on your plate , but do n't do anything stupid !, 
  ca n't your dad prescribe you some xanax and adderall to help you get a nice legal buzz and keep that anxiety and depression under control ? 
  just do n't forget to drink some decent scotch to wash the pills down and you 'll be fine . 
  also , imo , whilst it may not specifically be a crime in a pure de jure sense , it crosses that moral line where something is intrinsically wrong enough to be inherently criminal due to its utter moral indefensibility . 
  the holocaust clearly happened exactly as it is described and to deny the suffering of the tens of millions of people directly and indirectly brutalised as a result is feels to me to be disgusting to the point that it is intrinsically wrong enough to de facto be considered a crime . 
  it is also important to remember all of the victims - disabled people , slavs , gays , political dissenters , romani/gypsies and many others as well as the jewish victims ( who were roughly 1/3 - 1/2 of the total victims according to the standards for inclusion employed in the counting of victims as to what actually consisted the holocaust and what was `` just the war '' ; a massive absolute number and proportion * were * jewish , but they were * not * the sole group victimised ! ), 
  and not let the holocaust be hijacked for political purposes by cynical individuals from either side of the `` holocaust fence '' as it were , eg neo-nazis vs zionists . 
  tbh i ca n't change my own oil either ... 
  i * can * change a tire very efficiently at least and * check * my oil levels , but i leave changing it to the mechanics ha ha .
