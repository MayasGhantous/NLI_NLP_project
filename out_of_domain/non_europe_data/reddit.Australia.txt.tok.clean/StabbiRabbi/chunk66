  the eu sanctions thing i mentioned is already in motion ( you can google it if you want ) and even american opinion may swing faster than you believe possible . 
  i mean now they are n't aiming to topple assad anymore , just roll back isis ; a big change from a year ago ... and meanwhile israel help isis ( without that in any way being their intention of course ) by bombing anti-isis hezbollah , saa and irgc fighters and supplies . 
  what happens if israel passes f-35 tech to the chinese ( as they did with f-16 tech via the lavi fighter ) to china , or crosses some other line ? 
  worms turn . 
  there you go  there is more out there , but i chose the toi as a source that israelis wo n't feel is biased against them ( despite my personal dislike for the toi and its generally very hard right-wing attitude - i 'm no lefty , but i do n't like the right much either ! ), 
  and al-monitor because they seem to be quite responsible in their reporting . 
  do you mean in australia 20 years ago under the same circumstances we would have behaved as israel does ? 
  or israel 20 years ago ? 
  sorry , i 'm not being obstreperous , i just want to make sure we 're talking about the same thing . 
  if you mean israel then i think that 20 years ago things were probably pretty similar . 
  the israeli left had more of a voice then and the population was probably less cowed by the politics of fear ( as personified by the wonderful mr netanyahu ... ) , but the first intifada had already happened so things would have already been swinging to the right ... 
  if you mean australia then i really do n't think we would have reacted the same way in all honesty . 
  after all britain never bombed catholic suburbs during the ira 's decades long campaign of warfare/terrorism nor reacted with collective punishments , shooting stone throwing children in the back and etc as is israel 's wont despite a very similar dispute against a very professional , ruthless , well-funded and well-equipped terrorist enemy in the ira ( whose professionalism militarily far exceeds hamas ) against both military and civilian target in northern ireland , mainland britain and overseas that exacted a hefty price in casualties . 
  australia is culturally very much like britain ( of course ) and so i believe we would have managed to demonstrate the same kind of approach . 
  of course the british military did screw up a couple of times ( eg `` bloody sunday '' ) , but it really was only a couple of times , despite the violence of the ira . 
  australia today is pretty much the same culturally as it was 20 years ago tbh ( i am old enough to remember the country as it was 20yrs ago very clearly , although my impressions as a late-adolescent then no doubt provided me with a somewhat incomplete understanding of the nuances of certain aspects of the culture ) , but the country was certainly already a pretty good example of a `` cultural melting pot '' with immigrants from every corner of the planet living here with very little friction between communities . 
  of course we 're no utopia and have our own share of racists and bigots , but the general culture is not bad like that . 
  then as now are two main political parties are/were the centre-right liberals and centre-left labor and these two parties capture most of the populations ' politics : very centrist with either a leftwards or a rightwards leaning , usually mainly economically ... 
  australia has n't been involved in any kind of colonialism since pre-wwii when papua new guinea was an australian territory . 
  now we financially ( and via other aid ) support png , but do n't treat them as a colony . 
  idk , australia and israel are quite hard to compare directly imo . 
  there 's quite a strong jewish community in australia , particularly melbourne - that 's where `` prisoner x '' ( ben zygier ) came from - and there are `` jewish suburbs '' in each capital city , but they 're just another cultural group amongst many here from asians of every nationality , europeans ( again of every nationality - including jews ) , middle-easterners ( ditto ) , africans ( ditto ) , south americans and so on ... 
  sorry , but i really do n't get your point ? 
  looks like i proved you wrong - again ... 
  look above your brilliant comment . 
  sigh ... 
  there 's the hundreds of articles . 
   the document also show the laws that must be follow by the occupying power so if you know and have evidence of israel not following those rules provide a source . 
  it says pre-existing * local * laws must be followed : are you seriously suggesting israel follows palestinian law ? 
  there are farms and towns throughout the west bank - remember the olive trees that the israeli government wantonly destroyed earlier this year ? 
  that was farming activity . 
  how do you think the native inhabitants have supported themselves if they can not grow any food ? 
  i would counter your accusation with the assertion that you have been entirely disingenuous and failed to prove any of your claims . 
  remember i am an impartial , australian ( ie uninvolved ) , non-ideologically driven observer whereas you are clearly indoctrinated with the ideology that drives israel 's immoral behaviour . 
  i 'm sorry , but it still does n't make a great deal of sense to me , although i really am trying to grasp your point . 
   why would they bomb ireland areas that where under they control ? 
  the equivalent is israel bombing civilian areas in gaza . 
  the british and loyalist forces were unable to enter the catholic areas , yet did not use air strikes to take out ira terrorists as israel does with hamas politicians . 
  how is singapore remotely like israel ? 
  singapore does not kill any civilians , occupy or colonise any other land or unilaterally attack its neighbours ( as israel does with lebanon and syria and would - if they had the military capability to do so successfully - with iran ... ) . 
  what do you mean by `` moral imperialism '' ? 
  imperialism and colonialism is inherently immoral as the actions of the illegal settlers prove time and time again . 
  what do you think is :, 
   deeper there but is close, 
  exactly ? 
  please enlighten me ... 
  are you saying i hate only israelis , or do you think i hate all jews ? 
  my knowledge of israel 's supporters is limited to and refers only to those i encounter in this sub . 
  i have never visited israel , but i should be very interested to . 
  fyi all my thoughts are my own and influenced only by the mainstream press , what i read in this sub , my knowledge of history and discussions with people ( family and friends ) in australia , the uk and america . 
  they are actually very commonly held thoughts in these countries , with the possible exception of the us . 
  i have no anti-israel animus ; i merely take exception to the current regime and netanyahu in particular , the illegal colonisation of palestine together with its associated actions and policies and the warmongering against iran . 
  i also take exception to the hypocrisy i see in many claims made in this sub , although that is an issue of an entirely different nature and should n't really be included with the others . 
  go through my post history if you can be bothered and you will find i * never * criticise ordinary israelis , israel 's right to existence or need for existence let alone jews generally : only those topics . 
  indeed , more than once i have called anti-semites out for being the vile bigots they are . 
  were the wrongs to cease so would my criticisms . 
  i dislike bigotry wherever i encounter it and am sad to report many pro-israeli redditors are just as bigoted as those they accuse of being anti-semites . 
  criticising israel 's government and its actions , the idf and its actions and the illegal settlers and their colonial project is not anti-semitism . 
  to call it so takes away from the meaning of that term which should refer to a particularly ugly strand of bigotry , not reasoned and reasonable political and moral stances . 
  if you disagree with my view of things that 's fine ; you 're allowed to disagree with me and i with you . 
  it does n't mean i have any * hatred * nor obsession for israel any more than your constant pro-israel posting makes you a paid shill . 
  i do n't hate you either ; indeed until this comment i had respected your expression of your opinions despite disagreeing emphatically with many of them . 
  do you not think discussion and debate is healthy ? 
  is it not everyone 's right to hold their own opinions . 
  or is n't that how it works for people who hold opinions different to your own . 
  i had been happy to discuss these issues with you previously , but shall do so no more . 
   the key argument in the palestinian narrative is that the jews are mere foreign invaders , who have zero connection to the land , and use a mythical religious explanation as an excuse to rule over land that should rightfully be ruled by arabs . 
  discoveries like this undermine that narrative, 
  except they do n't `` undermine that narrative '' in any sense whatsoever . 
  we all know the jews * used * to live in * ancient * palestine from trustworthy sources such as the romans . 
  we also know that they abrogated their connection ** two millennia ago ** and chose to not even attempt to return , even after the wrath of titus for their ludicrous little attempt to not pay taxes backfired had long since been washed away by the passage of years and regimes ... 
  the history is interesting , but does not prove the jews have any legitimate , extant connection to the area other than that they have created in the past 70yrs . 
  does that have any worth ? 
  of course it does and i would never argue israel * should n't * be allowed to continue to exist . 
  does it justify the ongoing colonialism in palestine by the illegal settlers , let alone the ensuing apartheid policies that accompany this aggression ? 
  of course not - frankly , to anybody who is not a complete ideologue , the very idea is laughable . 
  antiochus epiphanes was a greek king , not a jew . 
  finding his fortress is fascinating and it 's a shame people like you turn it into yet another soapbox for your propaganda , but all it * proves * is that the jews * did n't * rule jerusalem for that period either ... 
  there should be no compensation package full stop . 
  israel has been bleating about iran being close to developing nuclear weapons since ** 1979 ** and yet here we are , 36 years later , and still no iranian nukes . 
  it 's just more typical israeli bullshit . 
  meanwhile , israel is the only country in the me that does have nuclear weapons . 
  weapons they acquired by [ stealing fissile material from the us ] ( http://www.afr.com/business/energy/cold-war-mystery-israeli-spies-may-have-stolen-us-uranium-to-build-the-bomb-20150330-1mawaw ) . 
  weapons that they refuse to even officially acknowledge ( other than to blackmail the us for weaponry with , as in ' 73 ) , let alone engage with the international nuclear non-proliferation effort over . 
  which makes their stance on iran even more ludicrous , hypocritical and undeserving of serious consideration . 
  in fact , given all of the above blatant transgressions against american interests and america itself , israel should be punished for its own illegal nuclear program rather than rewarded for its dissembling and fear/war-mongering about iran . 
  i wonder if he 's from new jersey - he sounds like a character i 've seen ( in advertisements for ) that `` jersey shore '' tv show ... 
  israel may not be an apartheid state * within its own borders * ; however , its policies in the occupied territories that let the illegal , colonist settlers live under one set of laws whilst subjecting the indigenous palestinian inhabitants to another , much harsher legal regime is certainly a form of apartheid . 
  you may disagree and i am sure you do not like hearing it , but objectively this is the case . 
  different laws for different populations based on ethnic or cultural differences is apartheid . 
  trying to claim that it is based on whether they are israeli citizens or not is disingenuous at best and in any case moot considering that that the settlers are illegal under the international laws covering hostile occupations ( to which israel is a signatory ! ) . 
  it is disingenuous because it is impossible for those arab citizens who are disadvantaged by the much harsher laws that they must live under can not become citizens of israel ; if , however , they converted to judaism they would immediately gain the right to do so . 
  ergo apartheid . 
  the radio station merely reported israeli actions . 
  if the actions of the israeli state/idf are perfectly innocent and reasonable then how is publicising them incitement ? 
  if , on the other hand , these actions are violent and oppressive , surely it is the idf/israeli government that is in fact inciting the attacks with its oppressive behaviours ? 
  we are constantly told that israel is a bastion of democracy . 
  freedom of speech and the press is a cornerstone of a democratic society . 
  why then is the idf so aggressive towards reporters who record and report on its activities , especially if they are as justified and reasonable as claimed ? 
  why do idf soldiers attack journalists , as seen in the recent pepper spraying and beating of journalists in the west bank and , of course , this attack ?
