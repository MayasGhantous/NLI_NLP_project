  that is a truly bizarre response to my comment , which you completely failed to address . 
  what is it about pro-israeli redditors and whataboutisms ? 
  it 's like the default response ... 
  i wo n't even bother asking what :, 
   i 'm sorry to sit-ups your warped way of thinking . 
  means . 
  i 'll probably just get more gibberish and another disconnected , foaming at the mouth , paranoid delusional rant back ... 
   `` the alliance is a two-way street , and we appreciate what we get as well as what we give '', 
  it seems countries are like people : some really * do * enjoy being roughly fucked in the arse without any lubrication !, 
  if i start doing the following :, 
  - fighting wars with some of my neighbours and occupying other neighbours ' houses then imposing apartheid laws on them and murdering their children ;, 
  - spying on america and interfering with the american political process ;, 
  - developing a covert nuclear weapons program which i steal fissile material from america to build more weapons ;, 
  - attacking any us servicemen who happen to be in the vicinity whilst i 'm brawling with my neighbours i fight ;, 
  - keep trying to involve america in major conflicts that serve my interests if the other parties are too big for me to take on by myself without some risk to my own person ;, 
  will america give me $ 5b usd worth of the latest military equipment ( that i can then sell to the chinese too for further profit ) ? 
  cool . 
  i did n't know you had a reddit account , bibi . 
  imagine an american reading that comment above :, 
   but , but , but ... 
  i thought only eurofags were capable of even casual racism ( except , of course , for racism against white people ) ? 
   i 'm confused !, 
  * americans * on * reddit * could n't have been misinformed , let alone ignorant or outright * lying * , could they ? 
  right guys ? 
  [ begins shaking and softly sobbing as entire world view crumbles under contradictory evidence ... ], 
  i 'd imagine the very concept of cricket 's popularity must be very confronting to americans . 
  i mean they do n't play it , yet even in ny it draws that kind of crowd ? 
  ( even if they are all fresh off the boat < insert foreign country here  - americans ... ), 
  also remember that this is the country where the sporting competitions/leagues will often have `` world '' in the name ( eg baseball is the `` world series '' , the nhl incorporated the `` world hockey association '' , although to be fair i believe that * did * graciously include one or two canadian teams , plus many other examples abound of names only fairly recently changed including the nba and nfl finals ... ) , even if most of these sports are only played professionally in the us and the competitions certainly only include us teams . 
  the very concept of truly `` world '' games such as cricket must baffle them profoundly !, 
  look at how they treat `` soccer '' : refuse to call it by its world-widely accepted name , ignore it entirely for four years at a time , become passionately interested until ( again to their bafflement ) the us team is defeated ( at which point they decide to sue the ruling body ! ), 
  then completely ignore it again for another four years !, 
  cricket must be even more challenging to their belief systems ; no wonder they respond so nastily to its gaining even a tiny toehold in their country . 
  i agree entirely . 
  i feel very sorry for the girls involved and can not understand how this is n't worth more than a warning ... 
  anyone who reads this sub regularly unfortunately knows exactly what the author is talking about in terms of the self-righteousness and belief that any action taken to `` defend '' against the palestinians is entirely justified . 
  i must admit that i was , nonetheless , still horrified by the exchanging of such snuff flicks in the same manner as people pass around porn . 
  i have read the the callous defences of the events depicted in such videos in the stickied `` ongoing violence '' thread ; even so it was shocking to learn that people are actually * enjoying * watching them . 
  the author correctly identifies netanyahu as a major root cause of such moral degeneracy ; however , as much as i hate to say it , reading this makes me wonder if my attitude that `` normal '' israelis are ok and it 's just the government , settlers , idf and other security forces that are , for want of a better word , `` evil '' is sustainable . 
  when large swathes of the population enjoy videos of people being hunted as crowds bay for blood , how can one continue to defend that population ? 
  to level the playing field and prevent such untrammelled acts of wanton aggression , surely if jews wish to live in palestine they must do so as palestinian citizens , not israeli citizens and under the exact same laws as the indigenous population . 
  until they are willing to surrender their israeli citizenship they are nothing other than colonising oppressors and their intrusion an act of aggression , not peaceful immigration , even without the appalling behaviour that you accurately describe . 
  ** never ** have i heard * any * pro-israeli commenter on here state that they are willing to even consider such a solution ; ergo why should the palestinians accept people who are not immigrants , but rather invaders ? 
  before the palestinians should even be asked to consider allowing jewish immigration , any jews who wish to live in palestine must voluntarily surrender their israeli citizenships and become citizens of palestine . 
  that would end the entirely justified accusations of colonisation and apartheid immediately . 
  perhaps then the palestinians might consider allowing jews to live in peace in the west bank . 
  lol , no . 
  how popular is that idea with the illegal settlers ? 
  do you think * any * of them would simply accept either palestinian citizenship or leaving their illegal settlements without resorting to their usual tactics of violence and aggression ? 
  for there to be a palestinian state israel has to allow it . 
  i know you 'll claim the palestinians have been offered statehood x number of times since ' 47 , but - outside of israel - it is generally held that these offers have all been deliberately framed so as to be politically unacceptable to the palestinians whilst israel continues its policy of chipping away at the viability of a palestinian state . 
  i doubt you and i will ever agree as you exist within the israeli propaganda bubble , whilst i live in a western democracy where we are not inculcated with ideology , but are free to merely observe the facts . 
  forgive me for assuming you were an israeli ; to my ear some of your comments have the ring of propaganda about them , but perhaps it 's just me . 
  led by netanyahu israel has become a society of extremists - did you read this article , written by a jewish israeli woman ? 
  you cherry pick two incidents and ignore the ongoing aggression of the colonial project being carried out by the settlers , many of whom are the most vile of bigots judged on their behaviour and their words . 
  in terms of which side kills more there is indubitably more blood on the hands of the idf than all palestinians combined . 
  israel can not claim self-defence whilst colonising what remains of the putative palestinian state . 
  the very idea is ludicrous . 
  i 'd like to say that netanyahu is mentally incontinent , but unfortunately the reality is less pleasant . 
  the man is actually an inveterate , perhaps pathological , liar and constant cynical manipulator of situations to his own perceived benefit ; how anyone can believe a word he says , let alone use arguments like `` netanyahu says he 's ready to negotiate any time '' ( whilst keeping a straight face ... ) , completely baffles me . 
  the stream of lies , dissimulations and prevarications that his discourse consists of is disgusting . 
  i 'm not sure why you put terrorist group in inverted commas , the stern gang/lehi were indubitably a terrorist group !, 
  not only did count bernadotte rescue thousands of jews from the nazis during wwii , he was actually in palestine to negotiate on behalf of the zionists when he was murdered . 
  it 's important to recount this history because whilst you and i may be aware of it , many people are not and those such as netanyahu will go to extreme lengths to muddy the waters . 
  settle down mate . 
  just because not everyone agrees with you does n't mean you need to have a temper tantrum . 
  hey it 's easy to do . 
  such topics are naturally infuriating , as are some of the denizens of this sub . 
  lowering oneself to a childish level of petulant , obviously reactive level of discourse does n't help you make an argument though , and i must say you were already on very shaky ground . 
  anyway , happy to help !, 
   israeli officials were briefed ahead of the decision and some suggested it was anti-semitic . 
  smh . 
  it 's ** technical ** . 
  the occupied territories are ** not ** part of israel ; it 's merely making sure the origin labels are accurate . 
   `` we made it very clear that we welcome eu contributions to the peace process , '' walzer said before the decision was formalized . 
  `` this might force us to reconsider that . '', 
  ah , trying to bully the eu . 
  smart . 
  very smart . 
  after all , that 's how the israeli government gets everyone else to do its bidding so it 's * bound * to work this time , right ? 
  and of course ayelet shaked is considering legal action . 
  but hang on , i thought international law was meaningless though ? 
  at least that 's what countless comments in countless / r/worldnews threads tell us ... 
  whataboutism ... 
  the favoured argument of the pro-israeli redditor . 
  if you think that is an issue petition the eu to enforce the law on those regions too . 
  i for one , as a consumer , would like to know that something i choose not to buy originated from a settlement . 
  i really hope australia ( my home country ) follows suite post-haste . 
  my motivation and the eu 's are entirely different things . 
  it 's kind of weird that * you * ca n't tell the difference between a a politico-economic union of 28 member states and an individual ... 
  when you start saying `` what about western sahara or tibet '' you are indirectly saying `` but china and an unacknowledged , but independent state do the same thing and you 're not making them label their products . 
  what about them '' . 
  that * is * whataboutism . 
  lol , ok . love the patronising tone . 
  i understand whataboutism perfectly , but am not trying to play semantic games . 
  i 'm talking in terms of the * spirit * of the term rather than one specific interpretation . 
  whilst i can see where you are coming from , i find it hard to believe that you * really * ca n't see that your broader argument is that israel settlements should n't be `` punished '' ( though stating the truth about where something comes from is scarcely a `` punishment '' ) for stealing land because other countries do it too . 
  by acknowledging the equivalency between the wb and tibet you are at least acknowledging that the settlements are an illegal , neo-colonial enterprise i guess , which is good , but then you 're saying `` just do n't make anyone tell the truth , let everyone lie '' instead of pressing for the eu to extend the same rules to tibet and etc , which is bad . 
  if there 's no shame in the truth then why hide it ? 
  is * that * clear enough for * you * ?
