  they relate in the same way that the un was formed purely to unfairly criticise israel , even creating the state of israel so it could do so . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  it 's not even supposed to . 
  the whole point is to muddy the waters and distract people from the underlying issues of israel 's appalling record of human rights abuses , colonialist violence and other illegal actions . 
  european culture has been weakened by the contagion of a foreign culture , alien to the people of europe that seeks to conquer and repress all before it as it remakes the world in its own grotesque image ... 
  i refer , of course , to the `` culture '' of the usa that has spread throughout the world like a metastatised cancer , destroying the native cultures of the hosts it infects with its banality , its worship of mammon and insatiable lust for war and conflict . 
  it 's tendrils work their way into its host culture 's cracks and soon centuries of tradition are eroded : arts and high culture are replaced by miley cyrus , cuisine by mcdonalds and everywhere rises up the coca-cola symbol like a mark of the beast . 
  if it was not for this degenerate influence europe would withstand the absorption of muslim 's into its native cultures easily , as it has absorbed immigrants and other cultures for millennia . 
  weakened by american cultural norms such as mindless consumerism , the worship of violence and perpetual war , corporations having more rights than individuals and idiocy being more valued than intellectualism , however , the continent has found itself adrift between its traditional pluralism and the realities of american hegemony that lurk behind disney and pepsi that require the other ( currently muslims since g.w.bush began his perpetual war ... ) be marginalised , abused and given no opportunity to live peaceably . 
  it is this that has allowed the evils of extremism to take root as , young people especially , despair of living a happy , productive life . 
  not a popular opinion , especially here on reddit ! , but one that holds quite a bit of truth imo . 
  the most important thing is to end the war , both to end the refugee crisis and allow for the clearing out of isis . 
  both require a political settlement . 
  as nasty as he might be , al-assad 's * is * the incumbent , legitimate government of syria . 
  to arrive at a political solution quickly it would simply be most practical to deal with him . 
  whilst there is no doubt that international peacekeepers ( ideally drawn primarily from muslim nations ) and strict monitoring of his behaviour would undoubtedly be necessary to prevent him from lashing out at political opponents , al-assad is simply the only player under whom a government can coalesce quickly enough to end the suffering quickly . 
  ideally he would be forced into a power sharing agreement ; however , whoever is the government needs to be strong enough to end the violence first and foremost , not risk the creation of another vacuum . 
  remember there are no good options . 
  although politically repressive , al-assad did not repress minorities ( eg druze , christians , alawites - obviously ! , yazidis , kurds and etc. ), 
  as almost * any * sunni regime is likely to do . 
  look at what happened in iraq when the majority shia were given power - isis is largely a result of that , but if the west is creating governments what other approach is possible ? 
  this would also be the most politically acceptable end for russia who , for better or worse , are now key players in the conflict and unlikely to support al-assad 's removal . 
  of course , this is just my opinion , but ending the war is surely * the * most important thing , for now at least ? 
  now , bring on the downvotes !, 
  considering [ the israelis sold china the technology to develop their own aesa ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/08/23/chinese-radar-strongly-resembles-israeli-product/32108793/ ) that is being deployed on j-10b , j-11d and future aircraft under development , one wonders how they will play with the su-35s pesa radar ... 
  military humour can be pretty brutal : [ from the vietnam war , but apparently still sung today ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yotsmhtwshg ) . . 
  the chinese would probably view this as a provocation , no matter that were it to happen it would probably primarily be precipitated ( at least in terms of immediate rather than longer term strategic reasoning ) by chinese actions in the south china sea ... 
  not only that , but the chinese very much appear to be well along building their first indigenously designed and built carrier at the same time . 
  nonetheless , i am sure they would * still * view such a move as is proposed here as provocative !, 
  so you 'd go to ... mexico ? 
  i wonder how long you 'd last there before a cartel murders you for being an american oppressor of the mexican people , you trump supporting gringo , you . 
  what if they do n't want to allow a racist , violent , fundamentalist christian gun-nut into their country ? 
  what 's that ? 
  you 're * none * of those things ? 
  but you 're an american and * all * americans are * all * of those things . 
  i mean look at the mess their country is in ( in our hypothetical situation ) !, 
  sure , i get that and i 'm not saying at all that it 's unjustified - just commenting on how china would view it and what their position on it would be . 
  it 's kind of obvious that that 's the case , but i guess what 's more interesting is to consider what the chinese reaction might be to this `` american aggression '' ( in their putative words , not my own thoughts ... ) ; i doubt they would fail to react at all . 
  however , that is not a good reason to * not * do it . 
  in fact , as you say it 's kind of the point . 
  it 's just something that does need to be considered , however ; if only to counter any possible chinese counter-reaction . 
  one place where their `` carrier killer '' df-2x series missiles could certainly prove effective is against a carrier in port for example . 
  forward basing two carriers would mean that very regularly one of them would be in port within range of those missiles so defences would have to be established against such attacks , as an example . 
  and you will occupy yet more of palestine to accommodate them , proving that the violence and oppression inherent in the apartheid regime maintained there is also necessary . 
  then you will complain when the world judges israel harshly for its brutality and human rights abuses , calling it anti-semitism and bemoaning that nobody in the eu stands up for israel . 
  of course you will never consider that by hyping up the threat against jews and playing the israeli politics of fear game to them you set up the circumstances about which you are complaining ... 
  the ** adl ** found this year that anti-semitism in europe is falling . 
  the perennial victim false narrative and politics of fear game being played is dangerous in and of itself and very much self-defeating despite what netanyahu likes to proclaim . 
  source ? 
  have three :, 
  not only in india , but amongst ** some ** - although of course ** not all ** - indians of the diaspora living overseas . 
  in australia unfortunately a minority of indian immigrant men have brought these attitudes to this country and numerous taxi drivers and doctors , amongst others , have been charged with such awful crimes :, 
  edit : highlighted three * very * important words ... 
  thank you . 
  i just saw his -100 comment karma and assumed troll , but it seems you did the work to uncover that that particular ( in his own words ), 
  was n't even trolling ... 
  i know a lot of sikhs who are genuinely very decent people and hindus too , but even here in australia we see signs of the hindu nationalists and their transplantation of their awful ideology here in all kinds of ways . 
  one is the litany of rape cases i provided ( from the first two pages of the most basic google search ... ) ; another is the terrible exploitation of their countrymen ( often lower-caste , women or other minorities within the indian community ) for visas linked to jobs . 
  it 's horrible to see because it 's so very alien to our cultural values of a `` fair go '' for everyone ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  considering [ the israelis sold china the technology to develop their own aesa ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/08/23/chinese-radar-strongly-resembles-israeli-product/32108793/ ) that is being deployed on j-10b , j-11d and future aircraft under development , one wonders exactly what it is that they are interested in from the su-35 ? 
  their aesa is reportedly superior to the su-35 's pesa radar ( an assertion knowledge of its israeli technological antecedents would support ) , so it would n't seem to be that ... ( will they even keep the pesa , or will they fit their aesa on delivery ? ), 
  * they already possess modern , multi-role flankers and the ruaf is reported as leaning towards preferring the two-seat su-30sms as being better for the role than the su-35 due to pilot workload issues , so i do n't see that its multi-role capabilities are much of a drawcard ; however , there must be something . 
  my guess would be the engines , but even then is n't china 's problem with engines more one of manufacturing ability/capability ( ie mass production of turbine blades and etc. ), 
  rather than understanding ? 
  perhaps it 's just a way to acquire the engines/engine technology for the j-20 program even ? 
  edit : is at asterix . 
  the other danger from the us 's aversion to casualties is that they rely too much on firepower and in doing so cause too much collateral damage , alienating the local populace . 
  this has been a consistent problem since vietnam especially , where rather than risk casualties the us will blow the crap out of everything with heavy weapons . 
  in vietnam it could be compared and contrasted with the australian army 's policy of constant , stealthy patrolling which kept the formerly very violent phuoc tuy province largely peaceful for their entire period of responsibility for the ao . 
  of course in vietnam different wars were fought at different times and in different places , but the same difference could be seen at play in afghanistan where civilian deaths were ( and still are - witness kunduz ) a massive issue for the us military strategically . 
  the french approach of keeping things small by default also has the advantage of avoiding this trap , especially in the specific scenario under discussion here in which a risky , but timely small intervention precludes a larger , more violent battle further down the track . 
  interesting factory shots of modern russian ecm systems being built . 
  considering how little is really known about these systems and their capabilities i found this to be quite interesting , albeit not overly factually informative of course . 
  at least he did n't say he would have shot the kid . 
  tbh that was kind of what i was expecting the end to be ... 
  is it the final one for this problem though ? 
  imo the american cultural acceptance of violence as a reasonable means to solve problems is the real issue . 
  the number of police shootings is insane ; american redditors regularly justify that by saying that the police have to be able to protect their own safety which in itself is indicative of the level of violence considered normal in us culture . 
  then there are all the comments from people who would shoot someone who set foot on their property , stole their phone and etc. 
  as an australian such attitudes seem quite frankly outlandishly aggressive and even people who do n't espouse violence as the answer to every little problem are very accepting of the violence that surrounds them . 
  what ? 
  from your own link the intentional murder rate per 100,000 people in america is 3.8 . 
  australia ( the country in question here ) is 1.1 , or a little worse than 1/4 of the us rate , whilst most western european ( france , germany , uk , netherlands and etc ) countries are 1 or below . 
  you are * significantly * more likely to be * intentionally * murdered in the usa than australia or western europe . 
  that does n't include the risk of being killed `` accidentally '' , `` in self-defence '' or by a cop . 
  your link clearly proves that america is definitely a dangerous place for tourists from civilised countries to visit ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  i 'm australian and have no idea wtf you 're talking about either ... 
  '70s [ italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_brigades ) and [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) there were left-wing terror groups , but * every * post 9/11 terror attack in the usa has been committed by right-wing terrorist groups or '' [ sovereign citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_citizen_movement ) '' ( who are all extreme right-wing ) ... 
  it 's what makes the post-paris `` no syrian refugees '' stance so grimly farcical . 
  you 're american i take it ? 
  or steal one of every pair except for a single pair - that you shit in ... 
  where 's the meat ? 
  great parody - i love how you even included a spelling mistake to match his `` pokeing '' ... 
  some sanity out of israel at last !, 
  good on them . 
  as an australian i enjoy not being murdered , terrified of police officers ( because they 're forced into being terrified of me due to the likelihood i will be armed - or , even if they 're just a bad cop , always have that as an excuse ) and etc , so no , i definitely do not want gun laws changed to be more like america . 
  i do n't get what your issue is . 
  presumably his family are always written about in capitals because they are some kind of gods .
