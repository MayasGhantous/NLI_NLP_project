  any call by hamas - or any other terrorist organisation - to attack israeli civilian populations is so clearly vile that it barely needs to be stated that it is so ; nonetheless it should never be forgotten nor forgiven or let pass as normal so there is a value to discussing it . 
  not only is it simply wrong to target civilians , but these types of statement by hamas fanatics harm palestinian civilians in a very real sense even if no direct action follows !, 
  at the very least they fuel the type of commentary from the israeli right that is dominating this thread ( and / r/worldnews generally ) , coating it with a veneer of justification that would otherwise be missing to leave the hate speech exposed for what it is . 
  the type of hateful comments i refer to are toxic and reflective of the right-wing thinking that currently dominates israeli politics , but as long as hamas threaten israel - despite the toothless nature of their braggadocio - fanatics can hide behind their `` righteous '' indignation at the threats and thus veil the vile nature of their own opinions . 
  these statements from hamas also make it very difficult for more moderate israeli voices to be raised as they sound weak in the face of hatred directed at their nation , further skewing the debate to the opinions of the right . 
  the other negative side-effect is that it keeps freshly painting for the world how the palestinians are also in the wrong within this unending cycle of violence thus masking their genuine and ongoing suffering , or at least ameliorating the egregious nature thereof by similarly coating its roots with a veneer of rationality and justification . 
  when did they act in good faith ? 
  it 's a genuine question - i 'm not trying to make some facile point , but am actually asking for examples as i would like to understand things better from both perspectives . 
  as a secular wasp from a western democracy it is very easy to see where both sides are doing bad things , but less clear when they have acted in good faith ( whether objectively so or even just in their own eyes ... ), 
  what will they be loosing ? 
  arrows or something ? 
  i do n't get it ... 
  anti-semitic bastards got what they deserved !, 
  they should be executed for treason , not just recalled to israel ... 
  you completely missed the point of this - it 's about * you * personally and your * race * , not general misconceptions about your country/nationality . 
  dumb polack ... 
  that 's extreme dude , to the max !, 
  not american either and i too enjoy not having student loan debts . 
  * fist-bump *, 
  great for the environment , priuses, 
  that 's not a cloud - it 's a duck, 
  chill dude , it 's just a word, 
  ok , now could you explain what you mean by * that * ? 
  call around local air-con repair businesses, 
  coooool ... 
  the removal of settlements despite the political cost of doing so certainly lends credence to it being an act of good faith . 
  the wiki link was interesting , but does n't discuss the aftermath . 
  what happened following the withdrawal , in both israel and palestine ? 
  things obviously have n't got better in the interim , with continued aggression from both sides ... 
  particularly the magic underpants ... 
  i 'd have thought a horny welsh ghost would have better luck disguising itself as a sexy sheep , would n't it ? 
  i did read that when i read the wiki page before , but really appreciate you providing information and discussing things without going off into a vicious diatribe . 
  sadly for the sake of real conversations that is all too often what happens in these threads . 
  thanks for giving a clear example - i 'll do some more reading around these events myself . 
  what exactly will youtube comments prove ? 
  everybody * knows * the comments are a cesspool - you may as well run this `` experiment '' on 4chan . 
  i 'm sorry , i do actually completely understand the point of the study , but you might be better choosing a more neutral forum , such as the comment section from a news site , rather than youtube . 
  unless your study pertains more to youtube than the reception men vs women receive when commenting on the internet of course . 
  in which case everything i have said is retarded !, 
  even within youtube though surely a make up channel would respond differently in its comments to some general content ( for example ) ? 
  fair enough , i 'm sure you 've thought it through . 
  i do suspect your results might be skewed towards the more unpleasant end of the spectrum , but you will certainly have a large test group . 
  dude , i * said * chill already ... 
  pretty big distance between `` no issues '' and `` my wife emasculates and humiliates me by taking all my hard earned when we 're not even divorced yet '' , buddy ... 
  ah , see i call it losing . 
  tautologous comment adds nothing to discussion . 
  not trolling , but rather making a serious point by way of sarcasm . 
  too often in / r/worldnews * any * criticism of * any * action of the israeli regime is labelled as anti-semitism , loudly , shrilly and accompanied by many downvotes . 
  by the standards of this sub these diplomats are , exactly as i labelled them previously , anti-semitic bastards . 
  ooh you a scary shitlord ... 
  i think of it more like anti-social media . 
  i 'll take care of this one guys, 
  that was exactly what i meant, 
  netanyahu seems to be a compulsive liar , we can only hope that the israeli electorate finally draw this conclusion and remove him and his regime from power ... 
  how about tel aviv ? 
  wow , interesting conclusion ... 
  no need to take this piss out of people for their religious beliefs or nationality ... 
  that 's not normal ... 
  until i read the article i imagined an atm that functioned along the lines of mr garrison ( from south park 's ) it bike , not just some rhinestones . 
  probably toast with vegemite , coffee and orange juice - just a regular breakfast, 
  as an australian i think it 's wonderful , but the balance of opinion seems to be that it 's an acquired taste ... 
  i 'd urge you to try it , but spread it ** thinly ** on toast with plenty of butter !, 
  do n't be ridiculous with that ott racist crap . 
  it actually completely undermines your serious point underlying that ugly `` joke '' - that there is a possibility this was done by mossad or shin bet to further weaken the palestinian government , especially given those organisations ' history of assassination . 
  israeli assassins do n't need to `` shape shift '' to sneak into palestine and set a bomb or otherwise murder their own political opponents in such a manner to stimulate internal conflict within the palestinian nation . 
  many israelis actually look very middle-eastern , not all are ashkenazim and in fact even ashkenazi jews are a semitic people - exactly as arabs are . 
  edit : ok , so this time i really do not understand the downvoting !, 
  let 's look at my comment and analyse where there is any racism , anti-israeli bias or support for terrorism :, 
  1st sentence ) saying jews `` shape shift '' * is * racist and certainly an ancient anti-semitic myth !, 
  2nd ) there is a ** possibility ** that some - perhaps even rogue ? 
  - element of the israeli regime 's security apparatus is somehow involved !, 
  3rd ) idf members regularly enter palestinian territory both overtly and no doubt covertly . 
  they are well known for their skill and competence . 
  4th ) arabs and jews are both semitic peoples ; this is a simple fact . 
  so please , like really please , will somebody give me some hint as to why i have received so many downvotes instead of just downvoting . 
  if there 's nothing anti-israeli , let alone anti-semitic in my comment and i am contributing to the discussion why am i being downvoted without even any explanation ? 
  you so crazy, 
  god save the queen ( by the sex pistols ), 
  toughen up princess - i just used to take a jar of vegemite and a spoon . 
  not shooting people, 
  and you guys wonder why people consider you to be entitled jerks with unrealistic expectations ... 
  i think it may have * started * even earlier , in the 1920s when many mass market consumer products began to become widely available in conjunction with credit plans , although obviously the great depression followed by ww2 interrupted its inexorable rise ... 
  i think society has become increasingly materialistic/consumed by commercialism at a rapidly increasing rate over the past 20 years . 
  i personally , whilst not immune , do n't like the trends i see . 
  i do n't think pooping * once a week * is a sign of good health . 
  doctors say once a day is . 
  leprechauns as far as the eye can see ... 
  try to join the mile-high club . 
  it 's best to approach prospective partners away from their seats where they are probably with family or their so , so try lurking around the toilets and trying to squeeze in with people as they enter . 
  other than that just read or enjoy the in-flight entertainment . 
  you also get free alcohol on international flights , so make the most of that !, 
  you can buy stuff from a catalogue the airline will provide - make a game of it by seeing how many different items you can purchase for say $ 500 . 
  plus if they ca n't see you , you clearly ca n't see them, 
  structures sentences poorly . 
  for example , yours would have read better - even without changing any words - were it written :, 
  `` what is something , that everyone does , that annoys you ? '', 
  had i taken the liberty of changing even just a single word i could have improved it still further . 
  seconded, 
  no need to have a cry about it . 
  i 'm a gen x'er and went through similar experiences to enjoy all of what you have * earned * - only without the burden of a wife and child - yet do n't feel any need to get up on my high horse about it ...
