   you refuse to recognize the facts of the situation because they do n't fall within your point of view : that the jews are the problem , this is just western imperialism , and that violence is the only way to solve the problem , rather than offering security and peace to the israelis . 
  where did i say * any * of those things ? 
  i happen to be very strongly zionist in my belief that israel should exist ( within the '47 borders preferably , but otherwise the '68 borders , of course ! ) . 
  `` the jews '' are , of course , not `` the problem '' , only the ultra-nationalist , ultra-right-wing , ultra-zionists ( eg current govt . ) . 
  it is of course not `` western imperialism '' , but zionist imperialism . 
  how * could * it be `` western imperialism '' ? 
  that of course needs to stop in the occupied territories , but israel can not and should not be dismantled . 
  it is the idf and settlers who seem to most strongly believe that violence is the * only * solution . 
  if the israelis want peace and security the only way to achieve it is is to come to a negotiated solution with the palestinians . 
  otherwise they will always resist , as populations have throughout history and unfortunately innocent israelis within israel proper ( ie not just idf members actively engaged in repression and terror tactics in the wb/gaza and illegal settlers - both of whom are , of course , axiomatically , guilty ) will get caught up in the resistance . 
  a single-state solution would be best - a homeland for the jews , but not a jewish state essentially - although due to the unreasonable attitudes of zionists who just do n't want to share it seems a two-state solution is the more likely outcome . 
  this needs to be negotiated under the aegis of a ruling body ( eg un , eu , us , arab league or a conglomeration of all of the above ) who can impose sanctions on non-cooperative parties ( as the eu suggested last year they will do ) and with the final agreement monitored and enforced by a peacekeeping force to ensure security for both sides . 
  the israelis will have to offer recompense in return for the palestinians giving up on the right of return , settlers will have to be offered palestinian citizenship or gtfo of the west bank as the settlements are excised , the palestinian constitution will have to acknowledge israel 's right to exist , the palestinians will need to be equipped with a strong self-defence force equal or superior to the idf , a war crimes tribunal will have to be established so that idf members can face due process and etc. . . 
  if such a settlement is not reached it will not be long before sanctions start to be imposed on israel . 
  the eu correct labelling policy re : goods manufactured/grown in the illegal settlements is a very minor foretaste of what is to come . 
  more and more state recognise palestine - israel * is * affected by international opinion and the world is sick of israel 's bullshit and egregious breaches of human rights in palestine . 
  people like you ** do not help ** israel 's case . 
  when you lash out with your laughable lies and paranoid delusions you merely expose the worst of israel and highlight other , less immediately obvious , israeli paranoia , racism and lies . 
  pathetic ? 
  look in the mirror . 
  there is certainly anti-semitism on here , and everywhere . 
  it is of course disgusting and indicative of the worst kind of bigot , most of whom are just ignorant arseholes generally . 
  the jewish people have certainly copped an unfair amount of bigotry over the years and as such israel per se is a necessity imo as a jewish homeland . 
  the problem is that the current ultra-nationalist , extreme-right-wing political climate in israel leads to a disturbing number of ultra-zionist bigots posting here too . 
  i have read many of your comments in * every * thread about palestine/israel and do not think you personally are a bigot or a shill , but sadly you do not represent the totality of pro-israeli commenters . 
  i have honestly seen many , many pro-israeli comments that are truly awful ( as bad as the most vicious anti-semitic / `` anti-zionist '' comments in all honesty ) and worry that these people are not trolls , but rather that their comments accurately reflect the views of many young israelis ( one of the few countries globally where right-wing sentiments amongst the nation 's youth is rising , if you remember the study carried out last year ) whose total immersion from birth in internal israeli propaganda seems to have made some not only viscerally hate the palestinians , but actually unable to recognise/refuse to acknowledge their very humanity . 
  this is very sad , as many jews - on any topic other than palestine - are quite liberal in their politics and not predisposed to such vile bigotry and vicious hatreds . 
  some of these commenters are actual illegal settlers ( and even admit it ! ), 
  who are of course raised to believe they have the right to take what remains of palestine , obviously because they `` deserve '' it more than the native inhabitants , but many are not settlers , but rather just normal israelis or even americans !, 
  personally i am a zionist as in i strongly believe in israel 's right to exist ; however , i ** also ** believe the palestinians have an equal right to self-determination and peaceful prosperity . 
  i sympathise greatly and respect very much the world 's jewish people . 
  however i do feel the time has come for israel to settle the palestinian situation . 
  obviously - as israel currently holds all the cards except international law , world opinion and the palestinians ' will to resist - israel 's good faith participation is vital for both people to have any hope of living in peace any time in the future . 
  ( of course the palestinians * must * play their part too and be equally willing to cooperate and make concessions in good faith too - that 's just not the point of what i 'm trying to say right now ... ), 
  what scares me is that if these comments from the bigoted pro-israelis really represent the views of israeli youth that the precondition to successful negotiations i mentioned above - israel 's good faith participation is vital - will * never * be able to occur , because such bigots will never give an inch ... 
  now talk about my username and ignore the points made ... : /, 
  perfect time for a single-state solution !, 
  if they just joined israel and palestine and made both populations all citizens the conflict could end . 
  the populations are demographically balanced . 
  obviously it would take time for the demographics of the new nation 's political , military and business leaders to match , but a radical program of positive-discrimination could be implemented to speed the catch up rate . 
   i support a two state solution , but it has to start with the palestinian government recognizing israel 's existence . 
  and it 's hard to negotiate with someone like abbas , who was responsible for the 1972 munich olympic massacre , and denies that the holocaust happened . 
    of course the palestinians must play their part too and be equally willing to cooperate and make concessions in good faith too - that 's just not the point of what i 'm trying to say right now ... 
  i did n't want to get into all of that in my previous comment , but yes , of course you are absolutely right . 
  the palestinians should enact a constitution that recognises israel 's right to exist ; however , there are so many individual instances of give and take that will be necessary that to start listing them now is a * whole * new discussion . 
  however , the particular point about recognising israel 's right to exist is actually highly pertinent though as it is some ultra-zionists ' refusal to acknowledge the same for palestine ( as i have noticed here ) that i was highlighting as disturbing to me personally . 
  it 's bad enough when * any * part of * either * one side holds such opinions ; if both do not stamp out/silence that bigotry within their own camp do the outlook is very bleak indeed . 
  peace is in the interest of both parties , but to quote albert einstein :, 
   `` the world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it . '', 
  in this regard it is important for both sides to clear house of those who would deny the other 's right to exist . 
  just because * most * israelis/palestinians want peace does n't mean that a vocal minority ca n't derail any hope of a resolution because the mass of the population tolerates their hate just because it 's hate from `` their side '' ... 
  oh , i thought you meant israel was researching building and using dirty bombs !, 
  the article did say the israelis were testing whether it would be possible to :, 
   make such weapons to attack civilian areas , potentially rendering them inhospitable, 
  if all they 're doing is researching the threat for actual defensive purposes i withdraw my comment . 
  what have i accused israel of doing that israel does not , in fact do ? 
  i am a firm supporter of israel , in fact i identify as a zionist because i genuinely support the right the of israel to exist . 
  of course they should withdraw to the '48 borders , but i believe israel is a necessary safe-haven for jewish peoples everywhere , and why should n't the jews have a state anyway ? 
  all i object to is the ongoing colonisation and apartheid repression of the indigenous population of what remains of palestine , the refusal to negotiate in true good faith to allow the ending of violence through the creation of a palestinian state , the murder of civilians ( by both sides i may add ) and the current government . 
  the problem is not jews . 
  it is not israel . 
  it is ultra-zionists , ultra-nationalists , illegal settlers/settlements and the present government that aids and abets these factions within israeli society . 
  fair enough . 
  that is , of course , not just entirely reasonable , but laudable even . 
  i hope they shared the findings with their allies as such research is invaluable to all states at risk of such an attack . 
  it 's good data for the world to possess - knowing that such weapons are relatively ineffective takes away from their intended usage of causing terror !, 
  in that case kudos to israel . 
  \\ ^ this comment is better than the joke !, 
  which was already brilliant . 
  you have a knack for hitting the nail on the head . 
   due process in a court of law and which has only ever executed one person who happened to be a mass murderer, 
  that one person whom they - without any process - extrajudicially snatched from a 3rd country , a country of which he was a citizen , then smuggled into israel for a show trial and execution ? 
  you choose to hold * this * incident up as an example of how israel 's * not * a rogue state ? 
  eichmann was obviously a very nasty fellow and i 'm not saying his death was a bad thing , but his kidnapping and murder was scarcely legal in any sense of the word !, 
  it was , rather , yet another example of israel killing whom they please . 
  another example is how , despite not having a death penalty on their legal statutes , israel went and assassinated - again without trial - the suspected members of the palestinian political group that killed the munich athletes . 
  then of course there was [ mordechai vanunu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mordechai_vanunu ) , the heroic whistleblower who dared to expose the israeli regimes illegal and highly regionally destabilising nuclear weapons program . 
  what happened to him ? 
  yep , you guessed it - kidnapped without trial and then taken to israel for a show trial and 18 years jail !, 
  how about the story of [ ben zygier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_ben_zygier ) , aka `` prisoner x '' , an australian citizen who somehow died in a `` suicide-proof cell '' to which he was secretly confined ( again without process ) for , well , nobody knows exactly what ... 
  israel is scarcely a bastion of strictly legal behaviour according to international norms . 
  in fact , in terms of their violation of other countries ' sovereignty , they are * considerably * worse than the regimes that surround them in terms of individual legal actions alone . 
  i 'm not even going to start on the illegal ( under geneva iv to which israel is party , having signed the treaty ) settlements in the occupied wb , collective punishments , apartheid regime of military courts for native inhabitants of the wb whilst illegal settlers live under israeli law , bombing of un schools , use of wp against individuals and etc. 
  i personally believe a single state solution is the best possible outcome for both israelis and palestinians . 
  it is the only genuinely fair solution possible . 
  i have every faith in the palestinian people to integrate peaceably into the new nation if my dream becomes reality , assuming the current israelis behave fairly during the integration process . 
  illegal under geneva iv , to which israel is party , that states an occupying power may not move members of its own population into an occupied area . 
  israel signed the treaty and yet is unambiguously breaking this clause of it . 
  that is why we call the settlements `` illegal '' . 
  it does not matter if some israeli court has ruled them illegal . 
  an international treaty that israel signed states that the settlements are illegal . 
  luckily the hassidim tend to have large families . 
  i guess the hope of reasonable people everywhere is that eventually they become populous enough to outvote the mainstream zionists and vote in a party that reintegrates palestine 's lost territory into a new state of palestine that has both jewish and native palestinian populations integrated as equals - not a jewish homeland , but still a homeland for the jews . 
  ( aka single state solution . ), 
   here 's what abbas had to say about a palestinian that shot a jewish rabbi because he dared to pray on the temple mount , who was quickly shot by the idf to stop his attempted murder :, 
  you use an example of an israeli religious fundamentalist breaking the agreement that israel signed regarding access to and use of the al aqsa site , which malfeasance led directly to the death of a palestinian to say * abbas * is the * bad * guy ? 
  whether or not there was ever a jewish temple on the `` temple mount '' has never even been proven ; in any case the site is holy to muslims and israel ceded control of and access to the site to the traditional , muslim owners . 
  the rabbi was acting provocatively , breaking the law and yet it is the palestinian who not only dies , but is the bad guy in your book ? 
  and you wonder why israel has no international credibility ?
