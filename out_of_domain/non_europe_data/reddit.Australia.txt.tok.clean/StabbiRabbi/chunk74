  after a while it clicked that they must really do that in russia and she thought it was a real possibility , certainly not a joking matter . 
  a bomber * is * on the top of their list to replace tornado , as they publicised recently . 
  tornado is strictly a strike platform , it is no sense multirole . 
  however , it is not a * heavy * bomber . 
  but if * all * the victims had been carrying concealed weapons then you can bet * all * those acts would have been stopped in their tracks . 
  what the us populace really needs is ** moar guns ** . 
  gun control is costing american lives !, 
  / s of course . 
  in australia we have a big problem with economic refugees/migrants from new zealand breaking the law then crying to the media when they are deported . 
  australia should have every right to deport these individuals without question , yet the amount of whining that doing so creates is * staggering * . 
  i think that the eu is wary of falling into a similar trap with these people . 
  ncis ? 
  i would n't take everything on that show as gospel . 
  i get that writing that steaming pile must have taken you * hours * , but is it really necessary to spam every . 
  thread . 
  with it ? 
  why not try to retire your comments after you 've used them in idk , like 10 different threads of something ? 
  resistance is a perfectly legitimate tool during an occupation - a fact that is even ratified in the geneva convention iv ( you know , the treaty - to which israel is party , having signed it - that defines why the wb israeli settlements * are * illegal ... ) . 
  attacking civilians is not acceptable by either side , but idf members are fair game in the occupied territories . 
  regarding civilians it must be remembered how many more palestinian civilians die every year than israelis . 
  this does not in any way justify the israeli casualties , but should be recalled in any overall discussion of the situation . 
  they have actually built a big wall * as well * . 
  trying to circumvent this `` security barrier '' to reach fields , places of employment or family members is one of the great burdens imposed on the palestinians by israel 's occupation ... 
    66 % of the public believe that if the current confrontations develop into an armed intifada , such a development would serve palestinian national interests in ways that negotiations could not . 
  can you blame them though ? 
  where has negotiation actually got them thus far ? 
  nowhere good , that 's for sure . 
  unless you consider under the heel of the israeli jackboot a good place ? 
  unfortunately the present israeli regime will never negotiate in good faith , without undermining the negotiations and offering a fair deal , without pressure . 
  if the world is not willing to intercede then resistance to occupation ( which is legal according to the geneva convention iv treaty to which israel is party ) is their only option . 
  this of course does not justify the murder of civilians in any way , but let 's not forget which nation suffers grossly disproportionate civilian casualties compared to the other in this conflict ( hint : it 's not israel ) . 
  my great hope is that the eu will follow through on their statement last year that they would be dragging netanyahu to the negotiating table and imposing swingeing sanctions if he did not allow a settlement to be arrived at within two years . 
  if the us and un could become involved that would be even better . 
  this is the best hope for a swift , peaceful end to the horrors of this conflict . 
  fair enough . 
  good comment . 
  my sister lives in north london and i drove through some of those jewish areas about three months ago when visiting her - they certainly do have a very noticeable presence , with whole rows of shops sometimes being kosher butchers/grocers and etc , but afaik they do n't cause anyone any trouble . 
  ( the one exception * i * know of was the women only allowed to walk on one side of the road incident last year , but that died down very quickly without erupting into a major issue iirc ? ), 
  their community has been in those areas for quite a long time ( and in london even longer - brick lane still has the two all-night bagel restaurants , but there used to be a strong jewish community around there before they moved further north i believe ? ), 
  and give those areas a lot of their character . 
  it is sad that this long-established community is suffering at the hands of a few dickheads , especially if said dickheads are more recent arrivals . 
  i 'm not actually jewish myself btw , let alone a * real * rabbi ... 
   it seems odd to me to have to explain this to you but the answer to that question is actually quite simple : because it is the right thing to do . 
  unfortunately that 's not the way most of indian society seems to think . 
  in australia a lot of indians exploit their countrymen 's desperation for a visa by charging them up to $ 100,000 for a visa-sponsoring job , then make the person who just bought their job work for nothing , or practically nothing , by working twice as many hours as stated or even giving their pay back as cash . 
  such cases were taken to court a number of times last year and many , many more go unreported . 
  obviously the neither the exploited worker nor the boss making money want to risk exposure ... 
  this is terrible in two way : a ) the obvious exploitation & b ) the circumvention of our strict immigration and labour laws . 
  there is not even the cynical fig leaf of `` if you have to bribe anyway ... '' , as offered up above at play here . 
  it is simple exploitation because it 's possible . 
  only country ? 
  even if we accept the premise that the british woman whose parents came from india is not british , despite what she and most other britons think ( ie that she * is * british - not indian-british either , but just british ... ) , what about australia , canada , nz and other new world countries ? 
  the problem is that it is not israeli territory . 
  a jew may purchase it , but it 's not then suddenly israeli territory . 
  without palestinian permission it should not be built on , let alone annexed as it will be . 
  certainly once it has been built upon palestinians will no longer be able to access the land and when a peace agreement has been reached the land will be claimed by israel . 
  moving settlers onto the land not only violates the geneva convention part iv , but was ruled illegal by the international criminal court in 2004 . 
  it is colonisation by inches and the reason israel does not seek a settlement , but rather chooses to fuel the conflict with such provocative actions as allowing settlements to expand . 
  whilst it is `` disputed '' territory israel can keep nibbling away at it . 
  the palestinians ( and the world ) see this happening , hence the anger . 
  to claim ignorance of this is entirely disingenuous . 
  so building infrastructure ; setting up political and legal systems that still function ; bringing technology and education ; creating the * idea * of a unified indian nation instead of a mishmash of princely states , personal/tribal fiefdoms , warring religious/ethnic groups and so on : despite all of these otherwise perhaps unattainable benefits , * the west * is to blame for india 's rising pollution seventy odd years after leaving ? 
  edit : spelling . 
   moving settlers onto the land not only violates the geneva convention part iv , but was ruled illegal by the international criminal court in 2004 . 
  it 's not simple , but the ruling is discussed here : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_law_and_israeli_settlements, 
  essentially the icc upheld that geneva iv was applicable to the wb and therefore the settlements are illegal . 
  by not preventing the establishment of a new area for the ( particularly troubled gush etzion settlement ) settlement the israeli authorities are tacitly authorising the settlement expansion ; ergo there is state involvement as they * could * very easily declare it illegal under israeli law and enforce that decision should they choose to do so . 
  it is disingenuous to deny that once built on as part of the settlement israel will claim the land as israeli territory . 
  it is therefore a de facto annexation that is intended to become de jure upon the agreement of a peace settlement . 
  edit : i understand that israel comes under a * lot * of criticism for the palestine situation , but from my pov it is because a ) israel commits a * lot * of * well reported * offences & b ) because of its claims to being a `` western '' democracy ( and admittedly as a result of the free speech israel * does * allow ) israel is a much more visible target that is much more * worth * engaging with than say north korea , israel is criticised more vocally . 
  imo that is not due to anti-semitism , but rather a belief that * maybe * appealing to israeli morals will do some good ... that is certainly why * i * am more vocal about israel than nk , but i am * 100 % certain * that the principle may be more generally applied ... 
  as soon as you build the land has been invested in and even if a hotel is built * some * israelis will live there . 
  giving up the land then immediately becomes an emotive issue ; i for one would be * extremely * surprised if israel were to surrender whatever is built once the issue comes up in peace negotiations . 
  also please read my edit above regarding why israel receives so much attention . 
  i bought a bottle just before christmas and at first taste my opinion matched yours to a tee ; however , i found two things helped immensely : a ) mixing in some water & b ) having had it open for a while . 
  both mellow the almost sickly sweet sherry flavour you identified to the point where , whilst i probably wo n't buy another bottle , i no longer actively regret the purchase as i did on first opening the bottle . 
  having said that i will reiterate that i ca n't see myself buying this again when so many other great cs expressions ( including the original 16yo nadurra and the glengoyne cs ) are available at the * exact same * price point , or a'bunadh for only very slightly more . 
  there are genuine underlying problems though - france may be in a temporary state of emergency , but that is permanent israeli policy in the wb ... 
  syria and nigeria are * expected * to be basket cases and are treated as such in all senses , whereas israel alone expects to function on two levels , at once `` the only functioning democracy in the me ^ ^ tm '' and simultaneously a strife stricken state on edge of chaos ... 
  it is those two issues which leads to the inequality in reaction , much more so than anti-semitism disguised as anti-zionism . 
  i wo n't deny such bigotry is certainly extant , i would just argue that it is much less the cause than is israel 's ( state actor ) behaviour . 
  ok , but it 's been the status quo for ** 48 years ** . 
  i do n't see your point regarding india . 
  india is not a developed nation as israel is and india receives a lot of criticism for its environmental issues , corruption , hygiene issues , nuclear program , `` rape culture '' and etc. 
  uk in iraq presumably refers to mesopotamia in the inter-war period as there has been no belgian congo since before then . 
  that period of high imperialism/colonialism was nearly a century ago and pre-wwii . 
  israeli colonialism is happening today when world standards of behaviour have progressed massively . 
  it is the belief that such behaviour is acceptable today that is at the core of the criticism israel faces . 
  why single out the uk then ? 
  the us was the puppet master !, 
  in any case the uk never intended to stay and withdrew as soon as possible , if not * too * soon . 
  there was no colonial intent , however misguided their involvement ( and indeed the entire enterprise ) may have been . 
  there was no displacement of population planned . 
  mate , we 're never going to see eye-to-eye and could continue to trade examples and counter-examples ad infinitum without ever doing so . 
  i agree with you that israel does receive a lot of attention ; it seems to me that our main point of disagreement is around how much much of that criticism is driven by anti-semitism . 
  i acknowledge that a certain amount of the criticism * is * perhaps either unjustified or motivated by bigotry ; however , i wo n't budge from my assertion that * most * of the criticism has been triggered by israel 's ( state actor ) actions in the wb . 
  i guess you wo n't ever accept that . 
  i think we 've explored this as far as is constructive . 
   was there a planned population displacement with the occupation in 67 ? 
  sigh .
