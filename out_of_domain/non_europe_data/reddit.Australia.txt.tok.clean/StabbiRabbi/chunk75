  see , that 's your problem right there . 
  that was more than * two millennia * ago . 
  how can you draw * any * comparison between the * roman empire * and modern mores and morals ? 
  it 's arguments like that that make it * look * like israel is literally taking the piss ... 
  not a good source perhaps and so deleted , but note the end of this [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaza_marine ) . 
   maritime law and israeli occupation in the palestinian territories also complicated the question of who owns the gaza marine gas field . 
  although they are legally under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority as a result of the oslo accords , ** israeli forces have prevented palestinians physical access to the resources available offshore **, 
  leviathan may have been the wrong gas field , but israel has indisputably denied income from the gaza marine gas field to the pa. . . 
  meanwhile , in other breaking news , the us state department announces `` water is wet '' . 
  thank you for replying . 
  i have watched this comment for a few days now and hearing what you have to say combined with having received a couple of upvotes makes me feel that i may join in without being seen as a disruptive interloper . 
  a few downvotes i can live with . 
  see you in the discussions . 
  indeed , israel is ranked about 100 in the world for freedom of the press/speech . 
  edit : removed a sentence claiming israelis are not interested in free speech because i do not in actual fact think that that is a fair claim to make . 
  israel 's government = / = israel 's population . 
  [ world freedom of press index ] ( https://index.rsf.org/#!/ ) published by reporters without borders . 
  israel is in position 101 . 
  [ here is the wikipedia article discussing the index 's background and methodology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) . 
  as you may see it very clearly is not a case of israel being picked on unfairly . 
  now would be the perfect time for america to invade and annex canada !, 
  that 's exactly what people said about the jews too and at the time they believed it . 
  i 'm not denying that the current wave of refugees are responsible for their actions ( eg incidences of crime , anti-semitism , sexual assault and etc ) , just that the nazis justifications had people believing that `` jews truly are the ones responsible for the ills germany suffered '' too . 
  it 's a slippery slope . 
  if you read the methodology it is very thorough and applied in exactly the same way for every country surveyed . 
  whether or not a particular press agency has a presence in any given country is not an indicator of that country 's level of press freedom . 
  the rating is rather based on the following criteria ( as per the wikipedia article ) :, 
   the questionnaire asks questions about pluralism , media independence , environment and self-censorship , legislative framework , transparency , and infrastructure . 
  the questionnaire takes account of the legal framework for the media ( including penalties for press offences , the existence of a state monopoly for certain kinds of media and how the media are regulated ) and the level of independence of the public media . 
  it also reflects violations of the free flow of information on the internet . 
  violence against journalists , netizens , and media assistants , including abuses attributable to the state , armed militias , clandestine organizations , and pressure groups , are monitored by rsf staff during the year and are also part of the final score . 
  i guess israel 's ranking is impacted negatively by the idf 's harassment and violence against journalists - [ israeli source ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.642636 ) and [ us source ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/09/27/israeli-military-suspends-officer-after-journalists-abused-by-forces-in-west.html ) - and factors such as the [ government organised and funded manipulation of social media ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.541142 ) ( this is a violation of the free flow of information on the internet ) , [ the imprisonment of whistleblowers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mordechai_vanunu ) ( an old example that would not have factored into the latest ranking , but just that - an example ) and the level of cooperation evident between the right-wing israeli press and government ( no source , but we all read the stories ... ) . 
   everything gets reported . 
  what does n't get reported about israel ( good or bad ) ? 
  what indeed ? 
  the answer is that we do n't know - israelis and citizens of other nations alike . 
  by definition we have no idea about what * does not get reported '' !, 
  anyway , i am sure you could have written this same answer had you thought about it . 
  not all criticism of israel is unfounded ; although i will add that imo not all of it is justified either . 
  in this case i do genuinely think that no bias is present . 
  you 're welcome . 
   do n't know i trust it with how much the international media loves to shit on israel whenever it sneezes, 
  to some extent i do agree with you in the general case - israel does come under a lot of media scrutiny ; however , as i said in my reply to / u/gvs03 , in this case i do genuinely think that the methodology is fair and thorough enough that it is not a case of unfair criticism/bias . 
   i would agree if this is israeli policy to be violent against journalists ; however , it is not and those soldiers were rightly punished for that incident, 
  i do not think that it is official israeli policy to be violent toward journalists and the case ( s ) where soldiers have been punished are encouraging ; however , we are all aware not every soldier who has harassed a journalist has been punished for their actions . 
  there are so many more videos of this occurring compared to convictions that to say so is not an unfounded claim in any way . 
   using old examples like you said does not factor in to the equation . 
  and old examples explicitly are not included in each year 's score/ranking . 
  it is hard for me to give new examples because things are not always publicised - do you remember [ ben zygier/prisoner x ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_ben_zygier ) who was secretly imprisoned and then managed to die in the `` suicide-proof '' cell he was held in ? 
  we still do not know what `` crime '' he committed ; was he a whistleblower ? 
  we simply do not know . 
   the fact that we get a news story in haaretz or ynet about everything good and bad in society seems to counter this statistic or your theory that the government is controlling the press . 
  haaretz and ynet ( which is very anti-netanyhu ) would have been out of business a long time ago . 
  there is no claim that the israeli government controls the press to the extent countries like russia do , but again we do not know what we do not know . 
  also some things ( palestinian stabbing attacks ) are reported very thoroughly , with every incident ( rightly ) reported on . 
  settler violence on the other hand , whilst not entirely unreported , occurs daily and yet not every incident of * that * is reported ... 
  anyway , it does not matter what either of us say . 
  people must make their own minds up as to the veracity of the index . 
  i believe it to be fair ; you perhaps do not . 
  everyone else can make their own mind up . 
  guilt will do that to you . 
  this is another tragic consequence of the illegal settlement program . 
  written like that it looks like a candidate for the next star wars villain ... 
  they are very [ popular in china and other asian countries ] ( https://www.vice.com/read/nazis-chic-is-asias-offensive-fashion-craze-456 ) - people even have [ nazi themed weddings ] ( http://www.chinahush.com/2011/09/13/wedding-photos-in-nazi-uniform-criticized-by-netizens/ ) ... 
  anjelica huston looks like gwyneth paltrow 's character in `` the royal tenenbaums '' in this photo - it was great casting the two of them together as mother/daughter in that film . 
  thousand-yard stare right there . 
  whilst expelling all non-jews from not only israel , but also palestine and murdering sleeping families along the way as they progress to overthrowing the israeli state and replacing it with a jewish king . 
  yes , these `` terrorists '' * are * the very model of enlightenment , are n't they ? 
  i will call you quenn petros557 . 
  long live the quenn !, 
    do israelis consider irgun terrorsists `` good guys '' like palestinians consider hamas terrorists `` good guys ? 
   some ? 
  probably . 
  many others ? 
  nope . 
  are you sure ? 
  let 's think about this a bit more . 
   note , in particular , that there were no modern israelis ( that is , citizens of a modern state of israel ) prior to 1948 , so mainstream jewish organizations , the jewish agency , haganah ( which grew into the idf ) , etc. 
  are the best one can do in asking for `` israelis '' to have condemned irgun . 
  note that israel 's government , once it did exist , wasted no time in identifying irgun as a terrorist organization . 
  of course , the later election of not one , but two , entirely unrepentant terrorist as prime minister - menachem begin of irgun and yitzhak shamir of the yet more depraved stern gang/lehi - casts * some * doubt on the sincerity of the `` condemnation '' you refer to ... 
  these two are the clearest offenders , but many other israeli pms were also involved in morally dubious activities undertaken during the colonisation of palestine/creation of the israeli state . 
  [ a complete guide to israelis ' / pre-israel zionists ' - israeli prime ministers included - attitudes towards and involvement with terrorism may be read here ] ( http://www.thehypertexts.com/israeli%20prime%20ministers%20terrorists%20nakba.htm ) . 
  edit : punctuation, 
  indeed , israel has an extensive history of rewarding zionist terrorists by [ electing them prime minister ] ( http://www.thehypertexts.com/israeli%20prime%20ministers%20terrorists%20nakba.htm ) . 
  what * are * you talking about ? 
  he 's asking about guys though . 
  would you date an indian guy ? 
  why , do you they 're filthy/smelly bad or something ? 
   the interesting thing here is the way that , given the rise of social media , terrorist tactics spread . 
  palestinians conduct a `` knife intifada '' stabbing jews ( and non-jews ) at random in israel and french terrorists mimic the practice . 
  i am not disagreeing with your main point or trying to argue with you , but the tactic did not originate with the palestinians . 
  it was first spread by isis . 
  of course , you are 100 % correct in identifying social media as how it was spread . 
  both the western nation `` jihadis '' and the palestinians took a leaf from the isis playbook with regards to this type of attack as they all started after isis spread and actively encouraged the concept via their propaganda videos , which are of course spread via social media . 
  there were two isis inspired `` lone-wolf '' stabbing attacks against police in australia that predated the current wave of violence in israel and palestine . 
  there were also the very similar and also isis inspired canadian incidents just before the first australian attack . 
  the attraction of this type of attack is that it can be carried out without any specialised/restricted equipment by an individual who does not belong to a cell/group . 
  the fact that no infrastructure is required to support such attacks makes them almost impossible to guard against , which must further increase their popularity . 
  if the perpetrators only lurk on social media sites rather than posting themselves they are able to go unnoticed right up to the moment when some random victim - chosen simply because they are jewish , a member of the armed forces/police or because of some other facet of who they are/what they do - gets attacked .
