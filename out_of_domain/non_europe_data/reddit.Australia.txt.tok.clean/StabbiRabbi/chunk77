  the eu 's position on israel is very clear and does not need to be adjusted : [ israelis must decide whether their future is to lie with europe or the settlements ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_how_to_revive_eu_policy_on_the_israeli_palestinian_conflict3039 ) . 
  the eu need to follow their [ mooted plan ] ( http://rightsforum.org/sites/default/files/files/eepg-letter-calling-for-new-eu-approach-to-israeli-palestinian-conflict.pdf ) of forcing netanyahu to negotiate and imposing swingeing sanctions if an agreement is not reached within set paramenters . 
  edit : added sources, 
  guns are * always * the answer to your average american ... 
  there were at least two innocent bystanders killed , including a dutch national ... 
  what is fpi ? 
  did you get the job ? 
  perfume or aftershave for that interview ? 
  i had never heard of fpi before , only jemaah islamiah . 
  well , of course the communists did kill many , many more people even if you only include the soviets . 
  add in the chinese communists and they just blow the nazis out of the water . 
  turns out they 've actually done better in a couple of those than i thought . 
  turns out they `` kicked ass '' in vietnam , iraq and afghanistan - at least that 's what some american on reddit wrote a day or two ago . 
  boy , did i have that wrong !, 
  stupid me thought they 'd had * their * arses kicked in all three . 
  you can imagine my initial surprise and confusion , but eventual gratitude , upon learning the a truth about what happened . 
  i live in australia where , protected by insufficient amendments as we are , finding out the truth is not always as straightforward as it is for americans . 
  in israeli terms that 's * not * ancient history ... 
  european jewish populations having * any * connection with palestine is proper ancient history , but they refuse to stfu about that and go on and on about it as if it 's somehow still relevant in this day and age . 
   has there ever been any reports of gangs of rampaging jews systematically sexually harassing and assaulting europeans ? 
  afaik not on a street level , but the israeli mafia are notorious for enslaving and trafficking european women . 
  from wikipedia 's article on crime in israel 's organised crime section :, 
   according to a report by the israel police , drug trafficking , ** trafficking of women for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation ** , illicit gambling , pirate filling stations and real estate are the major forms of crime in the country . 
  enslavement is , of course , worse than being groped ... 
  yeah , i do n't agree that soldiers who are no longer in the reserves are legitimate targets , but in a resistance to occupation by a brutal foreign army such as is the case in palestine , idf soldiers are 100 % a legal target . 
  such resistance is specifically allowed under geneva iv - the very treaty that israel signed , but is breaching by allowing the illegal settlements in the occupied territories . 
  so they do * kind of * have a point , albeit not in the way you explained it . 
  that they do attack any israeli is what makes some attacks terrorism as opposed to resistance . 
  an analogy is how the idf kills palestinian attackers instead of restraining them if possible - killing them in self-defence is like a palestinian attacking an idf member , but killing them unnecessarily when other options are available is excessive force similar to an attack on an israeli civilian . 
  that is why this investigation into israeli extra-judicial killings are so important . 
  just as israel punishes illegal killings , so should israel punish its citizens who kill wantonly . 
  to do anything else is nothing less than sheer hypocrisy . 
  excellent news . 
  good to see the eu hold israel to account . 
  there is ** no ** trade allowed between the eu and turkish cyprus . 
  tibetans are granted chinese citizenship . 
  therefore neither case is relatable to the illegal settlements . 
  claiming it is driven by eu anti-semitism is ludicrous . 
  the longer israelis believe this kind of paranoid delusions the more isolated israel will become . 
  israel is not criticised because it is a jewish state . 
  it is criticised because it is a rogue state , at least insofar as its behaviour in palestine ( illegal settlements , apartheid , civilian killings , etc ) , its illegal nuclear weapons program and intransigence in foreign policy is concerned . 
  in terms of recently built ships , australia has also just built two canberra class lhds , based on the spanish juan carlos i class . 
  spain 's juan carlos i is also a fairly new ship ( 2009 ) . 
  it flies av-8bs in spanish service . 
  turkey has also completed negotiations for a ship of this design , adapted to fly f-35bs . 
  italy possesses two carriers , one modern ( 2009 ) and one due for decommissioning in the early 2020s . 
  both fly av-8bs , but are due to upgrade to f-35bs . 
  presumably the older carrier will also be replaced after decommissioning . 
  this is clearly a positive development for regional stability , as israel must consider any further aggression directed towards hezbollah much more carefully as hezbollah 's capabilities improve . 
  hezbollah will obviously never be in a position to threaten israeli sovereignty , so any israeli disquietude must be be attributed to a desire to be able to attack into lebanon in the future as they did in the past without repercussion . 
  already wary after `` not winning '' against hezbollah in 2006 the idf will hopefully be kept in check by improved hezbollah training , intelligence and equipment . 
  particularly encouraging is the news that hezbollah * is * being equipped with the pantir-s1 ( sa-22 ) close range air defence system . 
  without having sufficient range to target aircraft flying over israel , this modern integrated sam/aaa system offers good protection against all airborne threats including pgms , blunting one of the idfs main strengths , its air force . 
  if pantir-s1s have entered the hezbollah inventory , it would seem likely that modern atgms and systems such as the very destructive tos-1 mobile thermobaric multiple rocket launcher and the man-portable rpo-a shmel have also been supplied . 
  these systems have been noted in syrian service , so there is good cause for optimism . 
  increased isr capabilities , particularly in terms of understanding analytical techniques , should also prove to be a great boon to hezbollah 's ability to defend itself . 
  it * must * be remembered that only israel now considers hezbollah a terrorist threat , with the group having been removed from the us terrorist threat list for a couple of years now . 
  now that israel is cooperating militarily with egypt and jordan , if hezbollah are better able to defend themselves the only country bordering israel that is still at risk of suffering an attack is syria , which is currently obviously not at risk of israeli aggression given the russian forces currently deployed . 
  these forces , with a proper iads ( s-400 and pantir-s1 ) protecting them , can now protect syrian and hezbollah weapons stores and deliveries , further bolstering the cost of the idf 's previously common unilateral air strikes . 
  why are you talking about the events of 1148 or the 18th century to make a point about moroccan jews a full millennia later ? 
  good . 
  we do n't need any lousy canadians here anyway !, 
  ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ everyone 's ^ ^ ^ welcome ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ visit ... 
   the economy needed to diversify while the prices were high to set you up for the bad times . 
  it 's * all * iran 's fault , not * canadia 's * !, 
  like the banks did in ' 07 ? 
   kerry said the claim was in the amount of a $ 400 million trust fund used by iran to purchase military equipment from the united states prior to the break in diplomatic ties , plus $ 1.3 billion in interests . 
  iran paid for weapons , why ca n't they be given weapons now ? 
  some decent air defence systems would help deter any unilateral israeli attack and thus help maintain iran 's new found stability and reintegration into the world politically and economically . 
  iran is buying russian sam systems ( s-300 ) , but if the us just settled this debt with a few pac-3 patriot systems iran would not only be better able to defend itself , but russia would be denied the income from arms sales . 
  that 's why i included the word `` visit '' ... 
  personally i think australia should welcome more refugees ; however , as we are currently witnessing in europe , it is a complex issue . 
  i ca n't say i feel that deterring people smugglers is not a bad thing in and of itself as they are criminals making money from human misery , but the door should be open to those who meet all criteria and follow the correct process . 
   everyone forgets why hitler wanted to get rid of the jews . 
  those greedy bastards are still killing our economy today . 
  how are `` the jews '' killing our economy , either today or in hitler 's time ? 
  this sounds like classic anti-semitism to me , mixed in with some modern islamophobia . 
  i take exception to some of israel 's government 's actions with regard to palestine , but it is just bigotry to blame `` the jews '' for anything . 
  not exactly true or fair . 
  australia has welcomed a huge number of indian migrants in recent years and most of these people have suffered no problems . 
  i have many indian colleagues , friends and acquaintances who have suffered no racism in australia . 
  there was a very regrettable spate of attacks on indian students in 2013 and before , but these have dropped off markedly since then . 
  they were carried out by mentally challenged white supremacists or muggers looking for an easy , physically weak , victim . 
  i googled for such attacks in 2015 and all results that came back were from 2013 attacks or earlier . 
   so ... the consequences for graffiti is to stab a person ? 
  ridiculous strawman argument . 
  the stabbings are not something i would try to justify or excuse , but they are caused by a multitude of israeli behaviours that make this attack seem trivial ( eg colonisation , apartheid , continuous oppression and idf/settler violence in the wb and etc ) . 
  such attacks as this are , however , not trivial . 
  they have a number of sinister aims - including creating a climate of fear , provoking conflict between palestinians and the israeli state/jews in general and trying to accelerate the illegal settlers ' intended ethnic cleansing of jerusalem in particular , but also the rest of the wb . 
  these fundamentalist terrorists are not even zionists per se . 
  they actually want to overthrow the israeli state as well , despite hiding behind the idf following their provocations . 
  why are you defending their hatred and terrorist violence ? 
   when the jews murdered the palestinians with their superior technology and backing from the `` jewsus '' . 
  government, 
  that is israel , not `` the jews '' , and furthermore the government , settlers and other right-wing factions rather than all israelis even . 
  please could you explain how `` the jews '' caused either of the financial upheavals you mention ? 
  these sailors * were * swcc boat crews , were n't they ? 
  as in nswc members - not devgru , but part of the same command . 
  [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mark_v_special_operations_craft ) were the captured boats , mark v ** special operations craft ** vessels . 
  i was n't actually trying to argue with you , just pointing out that neither 1184 ( in particular ) nor the 18th century say much about morocco 's 21st century culture or society .
