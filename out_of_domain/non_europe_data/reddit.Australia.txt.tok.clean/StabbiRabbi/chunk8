  it 's just how life works . 
  smug much ? 
  it did n't hurt , i found it hilarious . 
  thanks for the belly laughs . 
  many people outside australia seem to believe drop bears are n't real , but are just some kind of long-running joke aussies play on foreigners ... 
  ha , joke 'll be on them when 60kg of plummeting marsupial digs its claws into their heads if they come here and go for a walk in the forest !, 
  switzerland, 
  do n't forget to take some ecstasy !, 
  read and comment on reddit, 
  adidas has three stripes like the holy trinity - the orthodox church in russia is very strong and was even when repressed by communism . 
  wearing three stripes was a way of displaying their deep religious conviction without being convicted for being religious . 
  gross , what 's all that cum looking stuff on the side ? 
  it sounds as though you 're an outlier , as exists in any population , in so far as you have at least been willing to apply a modicum of effort . 
  your initial comment still exudes entitlement and your smugness in successive comments merely emphasises the effect . 
  you actually sound very bitter about having had to exert any effort and have had to work in jobs that are `` beneath you '' along the way to gain what you clearly believe should have been yours by right . 
  you 're * not * a special snowflake because you deigned to apply yourself in life , you just went through the normal stages of personal development . 
  yeah , i 'm the other guy you 've been trying to patronise so they 're not * my * interns . 
  i think you 're being a little disingenuous in the comment i am replying to and have certainly adjusted your tone to sound more reasonable . 
  you did n't actually use the term beneath you , but you did seem angry about having had to work that job ... 
  it 's good things have improved since then though !, 
  e : noticed * my * tone was a little patronising so i rephrased to avoid being a hypocrite . 
  if you follow this terrible advice please for the sake of your fellow travellers ** do not ** forget your headphones ... 
  he is hilarious !, 
  israel is indeed `` on the right '' as he keeps saying , the extreme right wing of politics !, 
  i ca n't believe people lap that kind of crap up - he is just as one-sided , biased and stupid as the canadian bald guy he mocks in his comically poor english . 
  do n't try to lay some kind of bullshit anti-semitic slur on me - i never criticised jews or israel , but solely talked about two specific organisations that have a documented history of assassination , kidnap and torture ( try wikipedia or watch `` munich '' , the movie , for a celebration of some of that history ... ) . 
  that is a long way from saying `` the jews did it '' . 
  are you * certain * the post i responded to was sarcastic ? 
  that kind of slur is ancient and invidious . 
  even if was sarcasm there are enough people out there who will take `` jokes '' like that in and internalise them , then use it to justify their own racism as being reasonable because theirs at least has some grounding in ( perceived ) reality rather than ludicrous superstition . 
  why wo n't the unthinkingly pro-israeli lobby on reddit realise that their refusal to acknowledge any criticism of , or even allow any critical thinking around the subject of , israel and particularly the current right-wing government is self-defeating in that it frustrates and angers anybody who reads thread after thread of their circle jerking , unreasonable and hate-filled rhetoric or gets 25 + downvotes for asking a question with no anti-semitic animus behind it ? 
  nobody in their right mind could say hamas are anything other than brutal , evil arseholes ; however , there are - unfortunately - elements within israel that are just as unpleasant and guilty of atrocities . 
  this alienation of otherwise uninvolved people happens both irl and on reddit and could be so easily avoided or at least mitigated by any effort at actual dialogue instead of just bullying and attempting to drown out dissenting voices or uncomfortable questions . 
  shape shifting actually referred to an ancient eastern european superstition about jews as referenced in the movie `` borat '' . 
  you really are blindly dogmatic and ignorant if you believe i 'm an anti-semite . 
  you can read my history - never have i once made any comment critical of jews or saying i think israel should n't be there . 
  nor have i ever said i support terrorists or the killing of civilians - by either side !, 
  criticising israeli politics , certain action performed by israeli organisations or having human empathy for the plight of palestinian civilians does not make me an anti-semite under any other than the most paranoid possible of definitions thereof !, 
  calling me such merely reveals your own bigotry , ignorance and serves to devalues the term which should be used to refer to racists who hate jews or long for the destruction of israel . 
  sorry to confuse your prejudices . 
  wow , you sound just like any 20th century eugenicist - `` the bloodline is corrupt '' ... 
  now where have we all heard * that * kind of rhetoric before ? 
  well i did - but i 'll explain it for you if you like . 
  one clear example is how he repeatedly he keeps saying `` on the right/wrong '' instead of `` in the right/wrong '' when talking about israel not necessarily being * in * the wrong for being stronger . 
  his english is littered with similar examples of poor grammar and use of the language - it does n't render him unintelligible , but it grates on the ear of a native english speaker and unintentionally comedic . 
  more generally his content is also poorly expressed , a matter that has nothing to do with relatively minor lapses in proper usage of * a * language . 
  specifically it is extremely tautologous : he repeats the same ideas , `` facts '' and statistics over and over whilst using very weak analogies and metaphors that also contribute to the unintended elements of his `` humorous '' talk ( eg `` war is not exchanging recipes '' ? 
  really ? ) . 
  finally all of this would ** not ** make him sound ridiculous if he was n't trying to eviscerate someone else for * their * idiotic video . 
  people in glass houses should n't throw stones !, 
  look the canadian guy was another idiot , but if your whole schtick is mocking what somebody else says then you should try a little bit not to sound ridiculous yourself !, 
  if it was n't for that i would n't describe his english as laughable , but in context it actually is . 
  also / r/worldnews will mark your posts as spam and not show them if your karma is < -50 , some other subs must work in a similar manner too i 'm sure . 
  if you 've been getting too many downvotes you also have to wait 10mins between posting comments too . 
  i think that may be global throughout reddit . 
  oh do n't let this be your ex and her new , true love ? 
  that 's sad bro , move on with your life ( if that * is * the case of course ! ) . 
  he 's obviously better than you in some regard , best not to dwell on it and just find yourself then someone who is right for you ... 
  cheese, 
  i have had two rotties before and they 're just awesome dogs in every way . 
  your sleepy little friend is gorgeous , 
  i never thought i 'd see a story about * 500 * anti-semitic ** rabbis ** !, 
  wtf is the world coming to ? 
  being real though , obviously i know rabbis are clearly not anti-semitic : anybody who criticises netanyahu on reddit gets downvoted and accused of anti-semitism though so i wonder how those commenters will deal with * this * !, 
  i think it 's great every time you hear of protests from israelis who do n't tow the likud right-wing party line . 
  this is perhaps the most encouraging of all though , especially with elections looming !, 
  more power to them , i hope they can help free israel from war and the odium of that war !, 
  of course you do n't bro , but seriously concentrate on yourself . 
  i know this wo n't make sense to you right now , but you 'll be ok and find someone when the time 's right for you . 
  the worst thing you can do is brood and obsess over it . 
  23/19 is n't a huge gap . 
  many of my girlfriends around that age were that kind of difference . 
  pray . 
  go to the market . 
  kill myself . 
  all converts get a free bomb vest as i understand it ... 
  just kidding , i guess i 'd mourn bacon briefly and get on with life as a muslim . 
  they 're just people like any of us except for a very nasty minority epitomised by isis . 
  your life would be more affected by your socio-economic position and education which would n't have changed . 
  there 's a great old docco about this from that era called `` reefer madness '', 
  it 's my understanding that they 're actually genetically inferior - the epitome of human evolution was reached with those born in the mid - '70s , but since then every 5yrs or so there is a 5 % degradation in the quality of their dna !, 
  it 's not understood why , but may be due to chemicals polluting the environment , the removal of any `` survival of the fittest '' aspect due to social conditioning or something related to their parents having been exposed to '80s `` poodle rock '' and subsequent other cheesy cultural fads and trends ... 
  i wish i could link to the studies , but they 're all behind paywalls . 
  edit : jeez guys , i was * joking * ... 
  i thought the references to poodle rock being a factor would make that clear , if the obviously ludicrous premise of the comment alone was n't enough , but evidently not !, 
  so i will now explicitly state it : this is a ridiculous idea and is no way true . 
  there are no references behind paywalls . 
  evolution continues ( i guess , who knows ? ) . 
  furthermore , i 'm sorry for upsetting you all :(, 
  any criticism of any aspect - or even questions asked from a neutral perspective - about anything israel does can gain  25 downvotes and an accusation of being anti-semitic . 
  that includes netanyahu and likud . 
  that 's not hyperbole unfortunately , just an observation . 
  netanyahu is n't universally unpopular in this sub by any means . 
  you 're totally right - i actually know that , but nonetheless typed `` tow '' like a dumbass !, 
  thanks for the correction , complete with etymology !, 
  ok , just from today : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2v3gsq/explosion_rocks_gaza_in_apparent_assassination/coefk9r, 
  you will see that here i am being accused of being anti-semitic without criticising israel as a country , jews as a race or promoting terrorism . 
  this does n't refer to netanyahu per se , but it is a non-anti-israel/israeli comment where i am straight out called an anti-semite * just a couple of hours ago * !, 
  i could dredge up multiple such instances if i had the inclination , but hopefully one that it is so very recent helps prove my point ... 
  the it varies from thread to thread .
