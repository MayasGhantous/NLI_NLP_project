  others , such as ancient egyptians , hittites , persians , babylonians , and mongols , were historical ` events ' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes ... like shooting stars , the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of palestine . 
  the people , however , survive . 
  in their customs and manners , fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity -- albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of islam and arabic culture . '', 
   genetic analysis suggests that a majority of the muslims of palestine , inclusive of arab citizens of israel , are descendants of christians , jews and other earlier inhabitants of the southern levant whose core may reach back to prehistoric times .

   the linguistic differences in the arabic language has grown so much , there is talk of calling it arabic * languages * now . 
   palestinians did not start calling themselves `` palestinian '' because of arafat , as you will be told . 
  they started long before . 
  the land was n't called `` palestine '' because of the romans . 
  it was called that long before the romans . 
  the first reference to `` palestine '' was in 12th century bce egypt , and has largely been known as palestine throughout history . 
  even during the short period of the israelite kingdom , the coastal area was still known as palestine ( in english ) . 
   genetically , dna studies show that muslim palestinian arabs and jews belong to the same gene pool . 
  they are the same people .

   palestinians were acutely aware of their distinctiveness from other arabs even during the ottomans , whose rule was mostly indirect , leaving the palestinians to largely govern themselves ( encyclopedia britannica ), 
   modern leadership, 
   ** 1919 : aref al-dajani president of the palestine arab congress , ( also president of the jerusalem christian-muslim society ) . 
  also part of the executive committee were izzat darwaza and yusef al - ` isa , editor of paper falastin , the newspaper of palestine . 
  ( so much for an invented people . ), 
   ** 1920-1934 : musa al-husayni , former mayor of jerusalem was elected president of the palestine arab congress . 
  it had 36 delegates , including sheik suleiman al-taji al-faruqi , daoud issa , and head of the catholic community - bullus shehadeh . 
  the congress was opened by haifa 's mufti , muhammad murad . 
   1921 musa kazem led a delegation from the executive committee to meet the british colonial secretary , winston churchill . 
   1922 - funds were raised by the 100 delegate congress and executive committee by the selling of stamps that depicted the dome of the rock and said `` palestine for the arabs '' in english and arabic . 
  ( again ... usage of the national identity term `` palestine . '', 
   a women 's congress , attended by 200 women , was convened in 1929 . 
  organisers included wahida al-khalidi ( wife of hussein al-khalidi ) and amina al-husayni ( wife of jamal al-husayni ) . 
  it was led by salma al-husayni , wife of musa kazim . 
   ** 1934 , christian executive vice-president yacoub farraj became acting president . 
  the palestine arab congress was eventually broken up by the british and other groups took its place in a splintered palestine . 
   april - palestine arab party established . 
   23 june - reform party ( palestine ) established . 
   ** 1935 - 25 april -- the arab higher committee is established , on the initiative of the mufti of jerusalem hajj amin al-husayni , to oppose british rule and jewish claims in palestine . 
   ** 1936-1939 palestine arab revolt for independence against the british . 
  palestinian arabs - arab higher committee ( until october 1937 ), 
   central committee of national jihad in palestine ( from october 1937 ) 1 in 10 palestinian adults were murdered by the british and led to greater support for the zionist immigration and division of palestine . 
  palestine was lead by city leaders during this time . 
  each city had its own leader and coordinated attacks against the british . 
   from 1939-1948 britain and palestinians fought . 
  zionist immigration expands dramatically , most of the kibbutzes are founded . 
  thousands of palestinians are murdered and most palestinian villages are destroyed . 
   ** 1948-1959 all-palestine government established and is recognized by all arab league states , except the trans-jordan . 
  the prime minister of the gaza-seated administration was ahmed hilmi pasha , and the president was hajj amin al-husseini , former chairman of the arab higher committee . 
  the government was taken over and dissolved by egyptian president nasser , who was trying to establish a pan-arab nation . 
   palestine was occupied by israel , egypt , jordan , lebanon and syria . 
  war , massacres , and refugee status led to a largely government-less population . 
   **** 1966-palestine national congress established , with 422 representatives under ahmad al-shuqeiry as the elected chairman . 
   1969-2004 yassir arafat was chairman until his death . 
   1988 palestine declared its independence , and under the oslo accords , recognized israel 's right to exist , deleting the part of the charter that said otherwise . 
   palestinian history is far longer and richer than many would have you believe . 
  the above is one of the more thorough debunkings of the `` made up people '' false narrative . 
  i guess we 'll see with france . 
  my guess ? 
  netanyahu will say `` screw it '' and scupper the talks , taking france 's recognition on the chin , but - of course - blaming the palestinians . 
  he has repeatedly stated he wo n't consider a two-state solution in the past and has changed his story so often about so many things that it is difficult not to take his current `` willingness to talk '' with a * very * large pinch of salt ... 
  netanyahu says is n't always the same as netanyahu does . 
  idk what the answer re : gaza is , but the wb needs to - and can - be sorted out . 
  if hamas wo n't participate they can stay exactly as they are . 
  not for the people in the wb and as a result israel . 
  look at all the diplomatic moves just in the first month of this year - eu only recognising israel within '67 borders , us demanding accurate labelling of goods from illegal settlements in line with the eu , us ambassador 's speech , un sec gen speech , swedish fm and this french move . 
  if the wb at least is n't allowed ~ ~ self-government ~ ~ statehood then sanctions will be next . 
  nobody is going to attack israel , but they will strangle them economically and ostracise them - exactly like apartheid-era south africa . 
  at this point i think the world is more willing to accept a three state solution with israel bearing the costs and burdens of gaza until they can sort that out with a palestinian state in the wb as a base for resolution than it is further illegal israeli colonists in the wb and a continued apartheid regime in operation there . 
  edit : fixed wrong word, 
  so not all people are equal ? 
  israeli jews deserve to enjoy better treatment than israeli arabs ? 
  that 's what your `` best comparison '' implies !, 
  all * we * can do is watch anyway . 
  it 's been a good year diplomatically thus far , let 's hope some measure of peace is reached . 
  in the uk there are a lot of counterfeit coins that are poorly manufactured - there this would certainly be a fake . 
  does canada have the same problems ? 
  could this be a counterfeit coin ? 
  he 's in austria - what does aud have to do with anything ? 
  as a resident in an eu state he uses eud ( $ ) . 
  and it goes without saying that the absolute worst place for any woman to get ktfo * must * be at a pro-rape rally, 
  yeah , well here in western australia * we * call ~ 26.5 c a winter 's night . 
  ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ true . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ standing ^ ^ ^ up ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ american . 
  this works every single time . 
  i find leaving it on the heat for 10mins is fine , but otherwise i cook my rice exactly as described above and it comes out perfect . 
  surely it must be defined as a caliber ? 
  the same menachem begin who was the leader of the stern gang ( the zionist terrorist organisation that killed count bernadotte on begin 's orders ) , was later voted prime minister of israel and eventually given the israel prize for his activities ?
