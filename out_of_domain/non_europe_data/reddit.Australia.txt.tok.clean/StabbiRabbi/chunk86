  but , but * last * month the israeli [ news stories ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3ykgky/antisemitic_incidents_in_london_soar_in_2015/ ) said uk anti-semitic attacks are at an all time high !, 
  why would the israeli media say all time high , but the british jewish community say 22 % reduction in events ? 
  you can still do this today . 
  if there 's one word i would n't use to describe the us economy it 's `` fair '' . 
  when people with full time jobs need food stamps i consider that a distinct sign of marked unfairness , especially when their c-level executives are paid disproportionately more than average workers by such world beating percentages ... 
  how could you * not * eat the adriatic seafood ? 
  the best squid i 've eaten was in croatia , hands down , but all the seafood was perfect . 
  do mormons kill apostates ? 
   this states that israel ** has people ** whom are indigenous . 
  that does n't mean * all * jews are indigenous due to some ridiculous `` connection '' to a land they left , making literally no effort whatsoever to return to until little over 100 years ago , over 2000 years ago . 
  * some * jews have always lived in palestine . 
  not * any * of the ashkenazim , khazarim , sephardim or even * most * mihrazim , but only * some * jews whose families have always lived in palestine . 
  it is * highly * disingenuous to claim that this indisputable fact - jews have always lived in palestine - also means that * any * ashkenazim or sephardim are indigenous to palestine , let alone the west bank specifically . 
  this is another example of israeli hypocrisy , disingenuity and dissimulation that may make israelis ( and pro-zionist diaspora jews ) feel as though israel has a figleaf covering the injustice of its ongoing colonial adventure in the west bank , but fools literally nobody else on the planet . 
  the hypocrisy is especially highlighted by the constant `` the un is anti-semitic and its motions mean nothing '' false narrative/propaganda as for some reason israel seems perfectly willing to ( inaccurately ) cite this un decision as valid whilst vociferously denying the validity of every other un position regarding israel/palestine . 
  have you ( the israeli people ) no shame ? 
  or is it no capacity for self-awareness/introspection ? 
  regarding the un 's `` anti-israel agenda '' ( false narrative ) , that relies on the high number of motions criticising israeli behaviour compared to other nations , it is worth recalling that until the late - '70s when israel 's occupation really started to bite the vast majority of un resolutions were pro-israeli . 
  it is israel 's actions that draw censure , not that the entire world is made up solely of anti-semitic bigots !, 
   given that i have proceeded to successfully debunk your smears, 
  which `` smears '' ? 
  fact are not anti-semitic smears ... 
  israel * started * the '67 war during which they occupied the wb and gaza . 
  there was ** nothing ** defensive about it !, 
  both the ussr and the us informed israel that the egyptians had no plans to attack ( which should have been obvious given that only two divisions - less than a corps - were deployed ! ), 
  to no avail . 
  indeed , israel repaid america 's efforts to prevent the war by attempting to sink the uss liberty a few days later simply because it was observing the idf 's actions from international waters , actions that included war crimes . 
   the un ca n't force israel what to do . 
  no , but its member states can enforce sanctions , something that looks like it will happen sooner rather than later given the diplomatic measures already taken this year by the eu , us and un . 
  that ca n't force the israeli regime to do anything either , but let 's see how long the present-day , horrifyingly peace-averse current regime made up of netanyahu and his gang of thugs lasts as ordinary , non-right-wing israelis pockets are hit hard and their quality of life drops ... 
  it 's also one of the most troubled settlements whose colonists are amongst the most prone to harassing and attacking the indigenous population and tend towards ultra-zionism . 
  the population movement of israelis out of the wb following the '48 war was part of the agreements reached as to which areas would be israel and which would not . 
  the inhabitants were not `` ethnically cleansed '' , but left peacefully without any brutality , in the same way * some * arabs were not ethnically-cleansed from israel ( though death marches , massacres and other brutalities * did * encourage a great many of the native population to give up their ancestral homes to the invading , colonising zionist horde ... ) . 
  just because israel was not 100 % successful in its ethnic-cleansing of palestine after it changed the country 's name to israel does not mean that what happened was not ethnic cleansing . 
  the inherent racism that such `` services ' '' very existence demonstrate far exceed what would be considered acceptable in western nations . 
  legalities aside , no business in australia ( from whence i hail ) would ever advertise in such racist terms because they would get no business from being such unapologetic bigots . 
  this is , of course , a large part of the issue with zionism . 
  it is , unfortunately , an inherently racist doctrine , predicated as it is on the `` right '' of the zionists to the land over the palestinians who were viewed ( and treated ) with utter disdain right from the very origins of the zionist movement through to this very day . 
  turkey 's kurdish population is primarily in the country 's southeast ; the implication is that the kurds skew the turkish figures . 
  the op was a racist slur on the kurds . 
  was n't this guy 's story made into an episode of law & order ? 
  focussing not on the handcuffs issue , but grabbing him by tricking him into coming back to nyc ? 
  yeah because not being able to uninstall internet explorer even though it sucks and you want to use firefox , which you actually still could , is totally on the same level as poisoning babies by taking advantage of poorly educated mothers ' ignorant trust of western `` health '' advice ... 
  yeah , but you get to poo inside bro . 
  31.5 g is 1oz ( 28.4 g , but usually rounded down to 28 ) + one `` eightball '' ( ie 1/8th of an oz , or 3.5 g ) , a common unit of purchase ...

  man , if the iasip characters are bad people , imagine how truly * evil * their muscovite equivalents must be ? 
  i realise that a lot of the people affected do have difficulty with what would otherwise seem to be fairly simple tasks , but surely most could grasp ( as in understand ) the mechanics of washing under a foreskin ? 
  it really is n't difficult and avoids scarring children by performing mgm upon them . 
   i 'd think parents showing a little boy how to wash his dick would scar them more . 
  really ? 
  that makes it sound as though you have a very dysfunctional relationship with your parents . 
  the only way it could be a scarring experience would be if the parents somehow sexualised a hygiene lesson or if they insisted it was necessary to use idk , steel wool or something ( soap will do fyi ) . 
  mgm is * physically * scarring - it is quite literal mutilation . 
  as another commenter elsewhere in this thread points out , it is illegal to dock puppies tails or clip their ears so how come it 's somehow ok to inflict such an horrific , unnecessary disfigurement upon a human child ? 
  1 ) in most cultures it would not be awkward and uncomfortable . 
  i know the us has a weird prudishness about it when it comes to anything `` sexual '' ( although this is not at all sexual ) , but did you survive your dad teaching you to carefully dry between your fingers , toes and under your ballsack ? 
  same difference man . 
  2 ) my family is a typical anglo , protestant , upper-middle class family : i grew up in both the uk and australia and people in both countries were fine with little kids running around naked , or nearly so . 
  again , we do n't weirdly sexualise things so maybe that 's why ? 
  3 ) it is * literally * ( in the literal sense or the word `` literally '' ) scarring : it leaves you without a part of your body . 
  that is the definition of mutilation . 
  if anything scarring is inaccurate only because mutilation is a better word . 
  4 ) the health benefits are dubious and have long since been debunked . 
  it really is not hard to keep oneself clean and stop oneself from being smelly . 
  hey man , different cultures do things differently and it 's cool - each to their own . 
  i honestly did n't mean to trigger you ; i was just talking from a position of enlightenment and reason , but i 'm not saying you 're a bad person or anything . 
  btw , make sure you * do * dry under your balls carefully . 
  i did n't need a `` hands on lesson '' , but if * you * do just ask your mom or dad to help . 
  if you fail to dry properly you risk fungal infection . 
  of course you could just chop your balls off then you do n't need to worry about it , but that 's a decision you 'll have to make for yourself . 
  well , i was more saying that if you can keep your balls from getting crotchrot and/or smelling then cleaning under your foreskin is relatively simple , proving how unnecessary mgm actually is ... 
  this is another very clear demonstration of how for israel 's ultra-zionist fanatics the end always justifies the means . 
  one of the most common arguments from the pro-colonist crowd here is `` if they bought the land legally then why ca n't they build/live on and expel the native peoples from that land ? '', 
  it has been known for years by those with an interest in these matters that a * lot * of shady dealing has been involved in the colonisation of the wb : now we 're seeing this story drag these people kicking and screaming into the light and we can all see how rotten and ugly they truly are .

  i wonder who is trying to suppress people 's knowledge of israel 's close ties with the wahhabi/salafi sunni muslim world ... ? 
  the arrogance of saying `` no , we want more because you denied us war '' is , to me , absolutely astounding . 
  if they do n't like what 's offered they are free to walk away from the talks . 
  source ? 
  menachem begin was personally a terrorist , yet he rose to be israeli pm . 
  he is not alone amongst israel 's pms in having a very dark past . 
  these mks ~ ~ merely spoke ~ ~ provided unconscionable support to the families of dead terrorists , but did not carry out any actual violence themselves ... 
   how so ? 
  really ? 
  you have * no * idea ? 
  did you not learn * any * history at any point in your life ? 
  despite my doubts as to the sincerity of your comment i will answer , but it surprises me greatly that you need to ask . 
  he was a member of irgun , a notorious terrorist organisation and personally ordered the king david hotel bombing in which 91 people were killed . 
  yitzhak shamir was the leader of the stern gang and he too rose to be pm , the stern gang of course being most famous for their assassination of count bernadotte . 
  what about ofir akunis 's close links with settler groups , including avowed extremists ? 
  why is he not punished for supporting them and their actions ? 
  i 'm not saying these mks were right , but where is the consistency ? 
  do you really mean to justify a terrorist act ? 
  you do realise that 's where asking that question makes it quite clear you are headed ... 
  i do not support the terrorists , or the mks who were suspended - i was merely pointing out that their actions have been grossly exceeded by other mks who , instead of suffering censure , rose to the very top of the israeli political hierarchy . 
  i have read and agreed with many of your posts in the past , no need to look at your history man . 
  i am not trying to say what they did was ok either ; however , my comment was written in context of the op to which you replied :, 
   yep , you support terror than it ca n't be good for us to have you in our government , however this is israel we are talking about so queue the `` racist apartheid bastard 's '' rant ... 
  perhaps i should have replied directly to that comment ; however , i felt that yours was a better point to enter the conversation as i wanted to make clear that i was not condoning these arab mks ' actions either , but questioning the integrity of the comment that started the conversation .
