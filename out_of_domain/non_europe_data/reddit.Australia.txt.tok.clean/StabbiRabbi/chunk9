  if you 've nothing better to do you can review my history : i * never * saying * anything * about jews or israel per se , only commenting on the israeli government or specific actions of the israeli state ; i never ever support terrorism or the killing of innocent civilians on either side and yet i am regularly downvoted to hell for having basic empathy for the sufferings of palestinian ** civilians ** and daring to criticise or sometimes just question some aspect of israeli ** government/idf/politics / commenters on reddit ** behaviour . 
  elsewhere in this thread i provided an example from today , literally only hours old !, 
  i know a lot of israelis question/dislike their government ; it 's actually sad how little those voices are able to be exercised in this sub imo . 
  you 're just as bad as the foaming at the mouth , right-wing likud supporters . 
  bigots are bigots and every bigot is a jerk . 
  great comment . 
  i did n't actually * blame israel * , i merely suggested there was a * possibility * mossad or shin bet could be involved . 
  pretty big difference if you actually bother to read what i said properly !, 
  that would be different from being told i * am * an anti-semite , sure . 
  however , the difference between saying aliens * could * have done it and mossad could have done it , as i already pointed out , is mossads well documented history of assassination on the territory of other countries ... 
  i did n't see that thread , but that is just as bad as circle jerking that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism . 
  both are indefensible imo . 
  terrorism can not be condoned . 
  i 'm sorry , but i respectfully disagree and must admit i suspect you 're being disingenuous here ; either that or * you * really have n't been long in this sub yourself and possess a stronger sense of idealism than realism ... 
  look it goes both ways , the circle jerk can certainly swing anti-israel too . 
  neither of those examples are anti-semitic btw though , are they ? 
  i do n't actually say the palestine situation is directly analogous to the holocaust - as in death camps - just that gaza is like a ghetto ( ghettoes existed well before then ) and gaza * does * fit the definition thereof ... 
  and yes , you 're right , i did know i 'd get downvotes then , lol !, 
  hey , here 's a sub thread from literally hours ago where i am called anti-semite without making any comment about jews or israel , just mossad . 
  not netanyahu per se , but very , very fresh and it is * me * being called anti-semite without saying an anti-semitic word :, 
  it 's also linked to further down with more discussion if you 're interested , 
  you guys both seem rational and thus cool . 
  for the sake of brevity i wo n't provide my example a 3rd time , but i replied to sketchyhatching just a couple of comments above . 
  wow , thorough analysis and some interesting points !, 
  some of them i ca n't directly address personally ( especially right now given the present time in australia and that i need to go to sleep !, 
  ) , but one i shall is that mossad/shin bet do have a history of assassination on foreign soil and so i feel that questioning their specific involvement is not anti-israeli as they are a very specific subsection of israel as an entirety . 
  great discussion !, 
  ok , but surely that 's true of every comment on reddit ever , that people are expressing their world view ? 
  in any case i honestly do n't think , limited to questioning the possibility of mossad/shin bet involvement alone as it does , that it 's anti-semitic as i was accused of being !, 
  i did n't seriously claim they were ; you 're being disingenuous . 
  this time these comments are n't being downvoted ; more often than not they are . 
  feel free to peruse my comment history for many clear examples . 
  this is is an outlier . 
  that * may * be justified depending on how you frame your criticism - if you change `` jew '' for israel i agree 100 % !, 
  neat summation , you hit the nail on the head !, 
  i 'm not . 
  i 've never questioned israel 's value or place in the world , only ever aspects of the israeli government , politics or certain actions . 
  not the state per se nor its civilians . 
  that 's fair enough and very understandable . 
  i 'm sorry if my comment was distressing in that context ; i did n't intend for it to be . 
  is repeating racist shite really a funny joke though , or a dangerous flirting with racist tropes ? 
  btw i said ashkenazim * are * a semitic people as are are arabs ... 
  i do n't think we 're ever going to have a beautiful meeting of minds here , but i hope you can accept i 'm not an anti-semite at least . 
  i 'm in australia and it 's my bed time , but feel free to peruse my comment history if you 're thus inclined !, 
  at least you are open to debate , not just downvotes and/or as hominem attacks so we 're not diametrically opposite in our attitudes here , 
  i 'm ok with all that except i did n't say anything about `` jews '' , but rather mossad and shin bet - organisations with documented histories of employing extra-judicial violence and that are perfectly capable of running to their own agenda seperate from even the rest of the israeli regime , let alone the israeli nation !, 
  anyway i have to crash , i 'm in australia , but i enjoyed having an actual conversation with you !, 
  this has been pointed out before and i do actually know the correct usage ; however i appreciate correct usage and recognise my failings in this instance so thanks for the correction , especially with etymology provided !, 
  read on , examples below . 
  been discussed ad nauseum itt and it 's my bedtime here in australia so i 'm not going to go over it with you personally - read on though and if there 's anything i can reply to tomorrow i most probably shall . 
  sure - read through this thread and you 'll find a link to a comment subthread of mine from literally a few hours ago ... 
  lol !, 
  yeah man , i 've enjoyed our discussion . 
  good night !, 
  where , pray tell , do i criticise netanyahu in this comment ? 
  support the rabbis who do ? 
  certainly . 
  mention likud ? 
  well , yes , albeit without direct criticism ... 
  it 's a shame , is n't it ? 
  i guess it 's interesting in that it shows quite clearly why the conflict keeps on rolling on ... 
  i was n't joking and could n't care less about karma . 
  most of my comments get downvoted to oblivion because i * do * get accused of anti-semitism both implicitly by way of mass downvotes or quite openly despite never , ever saying anything against jews , against the existence of israel , pro-hamas , pro-terrorism generally or pro the deaths of innocent civilians on either side ... 
  and that last point is why i get smeared with the slur of being an anti-semite : because i have basic human empathy for the suffering of innocent palestinian ** civilians ** and dare to openly say i see faults on both sides . 
  i 'm sorry , but at least 7/10 of the israel-palestine threads i see are right-wing , pro-israel circle jerks led by a vocal minority of the same redditors , but supported by a mass of silent downvoters and i get sick of it - i chose netanyahu as an example precisely because he is perhaps the most egregious example of `` subjects pertaining to israel one ought to be able to express criticism for without being accused of anti-semitism , but ca n't on / r/worldnews '' ... 
  anti-semitism sickens me , but accordingly so does being * called * an anti-semite !, 
  read my other posts in this thread or have a glance at my comment history for supporting evidence of my opinions/further details of my arguments - i 'm sick of talking about it ad nauseum . 
  i only bothered to reply to you because you expressed yourself so strongly . 
  clearly other redditors feel the same way because this time i did get a bunch of upvotes - one thing you 'll notice i repeat ( if you do read my comments ! ), 
  is that i often say how self-defeating the circle jerk and accusations of anti-semitism are : they really turn people off from sympathy for the silent majority of reasonable , socially-liberal israelis and desensitise them to the term `` anti-semitism '' !, 
  the comment was meant to be about how it was good to see something positive instead of hatred and bile ; instead it got nitpicked to hell over phrasing ... 
  i was n't aware that likud descended from irgun in a literal sense , but i do know the region 's history well enough to be well aware of irgun and their activities . 
  interesting post man . 
  depends , it varies from thread to thread , but in my experience the vocally right-wing pro-israel lobby seems to generally have the upper hand in / r/worldnews . 
  there are certainly other highly toxic subs ( / r/conspiracy anyone ? ), 
  where genuine anti-semites roam free and wild , but i avoid them like the plague . 
  i 'm sick of arguing this , if you 're actually interested in anything other than pushing your own narrow agenda and want to see things from the middle ( ie non-anti-semitic and non-anti-palestinian : no hate speech at all ! ), 
  read my other replies or comment history . 
  i agree entirely - that was kind of my point ... 
  i agree entirely, 
  your statement about what makes an anti-semite is a good description , albeit far from exhaustive as there are many other kinds out there too :(, 
  unfortunately with the specific confines of reddit , / r/worldnews what i said seems to be a generally accepted standard amongst a certain population of redditors, 
  please read again . 
  i was * criticising * someone for making a `` joke '' about shape-shifting jews . 
  again i urge you to reread what i actually wrote : i did n't accuse `` the jews '' or israel ; i just said there 's a ** possibility ** mossad or shin bet may have been involved !, 
  you 're either being disingenuous ( if not outright dishonest ) in your reading , have very poor comprehension skills or did n't actually * read * what i wrote . 
  pot calling the kettle black . 
  * if * my post is propaganda then yours is doubly so . 
  i did n't actually touch on much of what you said i did , in this post at least . 
  i know a * lot * of your people feel the same way . 
  glad you can say it !, 
  i should n't be surprised , 
  please do n't try to patronise me . 
  i 'm not going to bother trying to argue with you , but urge you to read through some of my other replies itt or my history for some more nuanced arguments ... 
  sure , often criticism of israel * is * thinly veiled anti-semitism . 
  it 's a complex , nuanced problem . 
  i can only speak for myself when i say i know i 'm not a racist . 
  * you * said that shape shifting only refers to their ability to blend in when you misquoted me !, 
  * i * said shape shifting jews was a ridiculously , ott racist load of crap and that * it would in any case be unnecessary * . 
  please learn to read before rabidly bashing away at your keyboard !,
