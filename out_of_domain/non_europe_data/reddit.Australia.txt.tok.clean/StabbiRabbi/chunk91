  indians charge other indians six-figure sums for a job with their business that gives visa rights , then force the workers to work for nothing or substantially less than the minimum wage on top !, 
  we also have had a number of indian doctors abusing their position of authority to sexually assault patients , which is surely another symptom of the same mindset . 
  not all indian immigrants misbehave in this manner of course , most are decent , hardworking individuals who simply wish to improve their standard of living . 
   hezbollah responded by attacking an idf convoy with atgm 's and killed two idf soldiers . 
  and in turn israel responded by attacking and killing spanish un peacekeeping forces ... 
  not to mention israel who cut out the middleman and use their us supplied weapons to attack and kill civilians on the regular . 
  i ca n't wait until israel faces the icc with regards to war crimes committed since ' 48 , but especially during the occupation post - ' 67 . 
  if they are as innocent as they claim they should welcome the opportunity to bring everything that 's happened into the light too . 
  edit : spelling, 
  oooooooh how meta . 
  if i could be bothered i 'd submit this comment to r/shitamericanssay ... 
  i think * subnormal * is the applicable antonym typically implied when comparing `` normal people '' and americans , is n't it ? 
  jk , but is the whole thing really worth getting your knickers in a twist ( i think that translates to `` panties in a bunch '' in american ) over ? 
   should ~ ~ have ~ ~ ** of ** known, 
  sorry , jk on both counts . 
  i just ca n't handle all this politeness ; where are the venom-spitting grammar nazis of yore ? 
  ahem , amnesty international are well known one of the primary peddlers of ** anti-semitic hate speech ** globally , matched only by the un . 
  this must be true - i read in r/worldnews every single day . 
  if they 're not part of israel why is it acceptable for israel to keep funneling more and more colonists into the west bank ? 
   it seems to me israel is being very harshly judged for doing things every other country has done . 
  the founding of the usa seems much worse imho . 
  how come no one is concerned with how pakistan and bangladesh were carved out of india ? 
  the operative word in that sentence is `` done '' . 
  the events you are saying `` what about this '' over were in the past , when people had less enlightened views or not relevant ( eg india and pakistan * mutually chose * their arrangement - it was n't imposed on them as the wb/gaza occupation is upon the palestinians ... ) . 
  most of the criticism is focussed on the ongoing colonisation of the wb and the seemingly endless transgressions against human rights occurring daily in the wb and gaza , not the historical circumstances of israel 's creation . 
  i think i am typical of most people here arguing against israel 's actions concerning palestine - whether they be outrageous propaganda such as this , or repression in gaza/wb - in that i 100 % support israel 's right to exist , do not endorse terrorism against israeli civilians , am not anti-semitic and can recognise the good parts of israeli society and culture ; however , i also support the palestinians ' right to self-determination and freedom from occupation , and am outraged by israeli attempts to stifle discussion on the topic by labelling any form of dissent from the israeli narrative as anti-semitism . 
  almost everybody i know in australia holds roughly similar opinions on the topic . 
  i merely choose to speak out against it because one day in r/worldnews , i ( from my old account ) made some fairly innocuous remark in support of a palestinian state and was pounced upon , called all kinds of names and downvoted to hell . 
  this behaviour from the pro-israeli lobby initially surprised me and then , as i observed it happening in * every * thread concerning israel/palestine , quite naturally started to piss me off . 
  at that point i stopped using my old account and created this one , with a username that references the [ sicarii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicarii ) , an ancient jewish terrorist sect ( referenced in the linked wikipedia article as `` the earliest forms of an organized assassination unit '' , ie terrorist organisation ) of religious fundamentalists who stabbed their victims - quite literal stabby rabbis . 
  i chose it as a commentary on the cyclical nature of violence and an indictment of terrorism , but that seems to go over most people 's heads , leading to my being called even more names . 
  ( in hindsight i would have chosen a different name . ), 
  well if they want to keep it they need to give the indigenous residents israeli citizenship and end the conflict that way . 
  if the land is part of israel then the fact israeli colonists live under israeli laws whilst the native population live under much harsher martial laws means that an apartheid situation indubitably exists . 
  if israel does not wish to grant citizenship then the land is merely occupied and israel is in breach of the geneva convention and the settlements are illegal . 
  this is the position of every country globally ( except , surprisingly enough israel , lol ) , the un and the icj . 
  in either case the status quo is illegal under international laws to which israel is party , which explains the negative attention israel receives . 
  attacking israeli civilians is unconscionable and near universally condemned other than by the parties responsible ; i certainly condemn such attacks unreservedly with no ifs , buts or maybes . 
  the counter argument to your point is that a state of conflict currently exists and that the palestinians are within their legal rights to resist the ongoing occupation by confronting the idf ( this does not justify terrorism ) . 
  it must also be remembered that the illegal settlers are not saints either and constantly provoke conflict with the natives ( eg price tag attacks ) , conflict that the idf then comes in to violently repress . 
  a peace agreement would have to include security guarantees for israel which the future palestinian government would have to be held to account over , but an end to the occupation and illegal settlement 's growth would in and of itself reduce the level of violence dramatically . 
  achieving a peace agreement is not going to be simple , as history has shown , and the palestinians and israelis alike will both need to make compromises and concessions , but it is entirely possible . 
  both egypt and jordan were once implacable enemies of israel , but a peace agreement was arrived at between the three countries and has held for nearly 40 years now . 
  israel now enjoys a degree of cooperation with both countries that would have been almost unimaginable in the early - '70s . 
  i did n't say they were mainstream and am well aware their victims were initially jews who held beliefs different to theirs before they foolishly challenged rome directly and ended up atop masada ... 
  it does n't change that they were terrorists ( in modern language , not the language of the time ) . 
  my username was n't supposed to glorify them !, 
  as i said though , if i could have a do-over i would choose a different name . 
  did they not field install the `` fillets '' at the base of the tail on p-47s in the same way as they did for p-51s ? 
   fair enough , but then legitimate israeli self defense can not be called `` genocide '' . 
  i never said it was genocide . 
  however , [ according to the wikipedia `` genocide definitions '' article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_definitions ) , raphael lemkin the polish jewish jurist defined genocide more broadly than simply the massacre of an ethnic group alone , but rather as :, 
   by `` genocide '' we mean the destruction of an ethnic group ... . 
  generally speaking , genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation . 
  it is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves . 
  the objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions , of culture , language , national feelings , religion , and the economic existence of national groups , and the destruction of the personal security , liberty , health , dignity , and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups ... . 
  without saying i agree this definition applies fully to the palestinians , i believe it is to this that people who claim genocide refer . 
   peace is impossible because hating israel has become the entire basis of palestinian culture . 
  just look at how the recent stabbings have spread virally amongst young palestinians and how much praise they get . 
  i 'm sorry , but in stating `` peace is impossible because hating israel has become the entire basis of palestinian culture '' so flatly and definitively you * sound * like as much of an ideologue bigot as those palestinians to whom you refer . 
  i 'm honestly * not * accusing you and saying you * actually are * an ideologue bigot , as i fully understand that the current wave of stabbings is obviously an emotionally highly charged issue for israelis as you suffer through it . 
  i 'm just that pointing out that absolutism works both ways . 
  as i said before achieving peace will not be an easy process and the palestinian government will have to be held strictly to security agreements , but - as jordan and egypt very clearly demonstrate - peace * can * is achievable . 
  hope for a better future , long denied the wb and gaza 's occupants , is a powerful motivator for improvement and a shift in thinking . 
  remove issues like settlement expansion and the idf 's constant presence in their communities and there will also be so much less to enrage palestinians on a daily basis . 
  fully changing people 's attitudes - on both sides - will take time , but look at the news this week about the egyptian textbooks . 
  change will happen , but it needs air to breathe . 
   not until those people can be trusted to not attack israel, 
  agreed . 
   you have to realize this has zero chance of ever happening . 
  this i can not agree with . 
  warring nations and groups have reached peaceful accommodation throughout humanity 's history - if it was n't possible there would be no peace , ever . 
  please refer to my other reply for a more complete answer . 
   this history that led to this current state of affairs is very complex and ugly but the palestinians have never been israeli citizens and the current blockage of gaza is prevent hamas from getting materials to make weapons to use against israel . 
  the term apartheid is simply not accurate , israel grants full citizenship to the 25 % of its population that is arab . 
  show me an arab country with 25 % jewish population . 
  again , agreed . 
  there is no valid argument that an apartheid state exists within israel itself ; i was simply saying that * if * the wb and gaza * are * part of israel then that * would * make what is happening in the occupied territories apartheid . 
   that is what i find so strange about this situation , the degree to which people ignore palestinian provocation . 
  people bitch endlessly about the wall , but ignore the fact that it was built specifically to stop suicide bombers from entering into israel and it has worked spectacularly well . 
  but israel is blamed for building the wall and no one blames hamas for the suicide attacks . 
  * i * blame hamas for their attacks as do a lot of people . 
  the issue with the wall is the manner in which it slices through palestinian communities - if it was all built on israeli land there would be little cause for criticism . 
   the palestinians seem to be fine with the status quo because they have rejected every peace deal they have ever been offered , unlike surrounding arab countries . 
  this is a very complex issue and yes , the palestinians have - with the benefit of hindsight - been their own worst enemies in this regard , never `` missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity '' as the saying goes . 
  however , if israel wants the benefits of peace they will have to stop holding these historic mistakes against the palestinians and enter negotiations . 
  of course , the same is 100 % equally applicable to the palestinians . 
  previous offers were all flawed in obvious ( to an outside observer ) ways or politically impossible for the palestinian leadership to accept . 
  they need to accept if * they * want to enjoy the benefits of peace they 'll have to accept the reality of israel 's existence , give up on demands like the right of return and be open to some reasonable solution for the settlements . 
  i said it before and acknowledged it wo n't be simple , but both sides will have to make concessions and compromises . 
  the benefits for both sides will outweigh anything they compromise on though , so surely it is worth entering the negotiations ? 
  how did socialism become * such * a boogeyman in the american psyche ? 
  i would classify my politics as centre right , but i wholeheartedly approve of the social contract between individuals and the state including such socialist `` evils '' as a welfare safety net , state provided healthcare and corporations being held accountable by the state for their actions - the very things that make bernie sanders the nazi he is !, 
  if bernie 's a nazi then i guess i am too ... 
  my apologies for making an assumption ... 
  i can edit the comment if you 'd like ? 
  again i agree entirely . 
  the stabbings stopping * has * to be a precondition of negotiations !, 
  anything else would be insanity ... 
  equally , israel will have to put a freeze on settlement expansion .
