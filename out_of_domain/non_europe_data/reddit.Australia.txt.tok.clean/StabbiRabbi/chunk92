  again , trying to hold negotiations without such a freeze in place would also be insanity . 
  in vietnam it was a combination of the sea mines and linebacker ii `` christmas bombing '' campaign ( the only time b-52s were sent to hanoi ) that finally brought north vietnam to the negotiating table in paris and allowed the us to extract itself . 
  if the political constraints that had previously prevented such measures had been removed earlier the war could well have had a very different outcome . 
  earlier bombing campaigns had hanoi only a few days further bombing from being brought to its knees when bombing halts were called by lbj ; if rolling thunder had started as an all out campaign the north 's logistics capabilities would have been smashed in ' 65 . 
  instead political sensitivities led to a campaign of creeping escalation . 
  this not only gave time to disperse vital supplies and infrastructure , but also allowed north vietnam to become the world 's most heavily defended airspace , at a huge cost to us aircraft and crews . 
  let 's not forget cricket either - watched all over the world at many different levels !, 
  the `` wolfpack '' ( 8th tfw ) is robin olds 's old wing he commanded in vietnam . 
  fantastic unit history , including of course the brilliant [ operation bolo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_bolo ) . 
  pizza in croatia is good anyway . 
  i * do n't * like the american style thicker crust and overloaded toppings , but i enjoyed every croatian pizza i ate . 
  i 'm sure that soon there will be more indians or chinese people who speak english than there are americans doing so ( if not already ? ), 
  - at that point the english language will pass on to them and in turn americans will lose their right to use the language ... 
  that 's how it works , right ? 
  i can second this , the laphroaig px is a lovely dram and it is brilliant having a full litre of it !, 
  i have a bottle at the moment and am enjoying it greatly . 
  what is this , anti-free-speech month in israel ? 
  where is the a-6 intruder ? 
  yep , the inventor has come out and stated he regrets having done so due to their terrible environmental impact . 
  hmmm , a waxed paper cup vs an indestructible plastic and metal pod ? 
  i am sure you 'll find the cup is better in every way excluding your personal convenience and expense . 
  so do texans and massachusettans !, 
  not as hard as the landmines ... 
  as the poster above you notes , berkut should n't expect to shoot at protesters without encountering resistance . 
  it is the same as when israelis moan about idf soldiers attacked in the west bank and call it terrorism . 
  that 's ridiculous , they are soldiers , in a war zone where they should not be using lethal force themselves . 
  if military or paramilitary troops employ lethal violence in such situations they , sadly for everyone involved , must expect to be met with an equal measure of force . 
  it is no more or less illegal than their own use of such extreme violence . 
  citizens of a nation should not be shot for protesting their government anymore than an occupied people should be shot for resisting violent assaults open themselves as they attempt to live their normal lives . 
  ( eg palestinians attacked by illegal settlers who are then repressed by the idf in the exact reaction that was the colonists express motivation for their initial assaults - a regular occurrence in the occupied west bank . ), 
  all that says is that the specific berkut officers who were charged * may * not have been responsible and then enumerates a laundry list of `` potential suspects '' , most of whom , if they were n't berkut , were on the same side !, 
  there is a jewish member of the iranian parliament . 
  so abraham was willing to stab his child and invented mgm ? 
  man , he hated ( male ) kids , did n't he ? 
  yeah it was the whole thread that this comment spawned that prompted me to post it as much as op 's clear belief that `` german logic '' extends to * all * germans rationalising that murdering your pregnant girlfriend is just simply the logical thing to do and that was the reason behind the `` light '' sentence . 
  there 's toxic shit all the way down ... 
  except the [ iranian jews seem pretty happy ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/02/19/387265766/irans-jews-its-our-home-and-we-plan-to-stay ) . 
  the population has certainly been reduced by emigration , but persian jews still in iran enjoy solid legal protections . 
  the so-called `` jewish nakbah '' in which 700,000 mizrahi jews moved from their homes in majority muslim me countries is a bit more of a nuanced story than the israeli narrative presents it as . 
  there are still remnant populations in most of these countries who live safely and in peace , their communities and synagogues secure . 
  not all of the jews who emigrated did so because they were forced out by the local muslim population . 
  many emigrated to be a part of the emerging jewish nation for ideological reasons or perceived opportunities . 
  some were pressured by israel . 
  of course some were expelled , by many fewer than the propagandists would have it . 
  this is in direct contrast to the `` real '' nakbah in which * all * the palestinians were either forced out at gunpoint or at best stopped from returning at gunpoint . 
  i 'm not trying to paint israel as the `` baddie '' ; i 'm just pointing out that the history is not so black and white as it is often painted . 
  i think he means - quite correctly - that the criticisms * of * her are out of line , based on the rest of his comment and the reasonable , fair and balanced understanding of the situation in palestine that his comments in these threads regularly convey . 
  smh . 
  do you * really * believe the imaginary internet points * mean something * ? 
  really really ? 
  is * that * why the brigading happens ? 
  i thought it was just to bury facts and perspectives that were not 100 % inline with the israeli narrative ( propaganda ) , but is it possible some people * actually believe * the points have meaning ? 
  mind = blown !, 
   you can not claim the right to self-defense when you are the aggressor . 
  yeah , [ about that ... ] ( http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/07/04/israels-attack-on-egypt-in-june-67-was-not-preemptive/ ), 
  if we could ignore the semantics of what to call the official , israeli regime dictated account of events in occupied palestine for a moment , what about the imaginary internet points ? 
  * do you believe * ? 
   how about we have this discussion on real grounds , not the grounds of a guy with a ba in film who is a 9/11 truther ? 
  how about we discuss the facts , instead of just ad hominem attacking the author ? 
  do you dispute any of the facts he presents ? 
  they 're all widely accepted : the six day war wikipedia article notes that israel was informed by both the usa and the ussr that nasser 's force disposition was defensive , the two divisions deployed were utterly inadequate for any strike against israel and that nasser did not intend to invade israel . 
  will you accept [ the cia 's assessment ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/arab_israeli_war_1.html ) of the intelligence situation surrounding israel 's attack , which confirms that the intelligence * was * passed to israel , that all contemporous assessments agreed that israel was not in a position of strategic weakness and that israel was preparing for its war of aggression well before it launched its assault ? 
  or is the cia anti-semitic something something too ? 
  no , israel is not a highly militarised , extremely right-wing nationalist regime ruled state , engaged in acquiring * lebensraum * by colonising the territory of a people its leaders consider lesser beings than their own race . 
  is it ? 
  well , israel 's uniforms are n't as smart as the nazis , so that 's a point of difference !, 
  and , er , well i 'm * sure * there are other things that are different too . 
  so is it ok to make jokes about genocide now ? 
  because there are some * great * holocaust jokes if you 'd like to hear them !, 
  how can anyone trust a word netanyahu says ? 
  he is an inveterate liar , who changes his public position more often than he changes his underwear , but always returns to his `` no two-state solution '' stance as soon as he thinks the world 's back is turned and never flags in his support for the extreme-right , ultra-zionist cabinet members ' pro-colony/illegal settlement policies ... 
   academic study released in 2015 . 
  who performed the study ? 
  surely you would n't reference it if it was done by an israeli university , as if it was nobody outside israel would believe in the study 's impartiality ... 
  are n't these guys ultra-orthodox haredim ? 
  what are the percentages of haredim on welfare because they study the jewish religious texts instead of working ? 
  do you have a source that says these guys ' families are n't on welfare ? 
  if they are they are being paid by the israeli government , are n't they ? 
  [ according to the wikipedia `` genocide definitions '' article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_definitions ) , raphael lemkin the polish jewish jurist defined genocide more broadly than simply the massacre of an ethnic group alone , but rather as :, 
   by `` genocide '' we mean the destruction of an ethnic group ... . 
  generally speaking , genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation . 
  it is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves . 
  the objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions , of culture , language , national feelings , religion , and the economic existence of national groups , and the destruction of the personal security , liberty , health , dignity , and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups ... . 
  that sounds awfully familiar to me as a regular student of the israeli occupation in gaza and the wb . 
  repeating lies does n't make them true . 
  you have made variations of this statement in numerous threads , but it is as inaccurate now as the very first time you typed it out . 
  how about kids playing on a beach being targeted by naval artillery , in an [ incident observed by numerous international journalists ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10971306/israeli-naval-ship-bombs-palestinian-children-on-gaza-beach-killing-four.html ) ? 
  that 's not justified either , right ? 
  ah , as i thought . 
  thanks for the confirmation . 
  which one has to suspect suits the israeli regime to a tee , giving them fuel for their perpetual victimhood narrative and an excuse for their repressive , apartheid system . 
  whether or not that is their primary main objective is open to debate , but in any case it is a side-effect they exploit to the fullest extent possible without actually incurring sanctions . 
  yet . 
  the wb colonies/illegal settlements grew considerably last year . 
  the [ israeli mafia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_mafia ) are internationally notorious for their involvement in sex slavery and drug trafficking in particular , yet you 're indicting the israeli * arab * community as a hotbed of organised crime ? 
  the linked article states that of 16 israeli crime families only 3 are arab . 
  that is proportional with the arab population in israel , slightly lesser in fact . 
  of course arab organised crime should be dealt with , but let 's not try to make out that arabs are more criminally-oriented than jews in israel !, 
  so israeli arabs get free electricity ? 
  i know israel supplies power to the occupied territories as part of its obligations as an hostile occupation force , but i was n't aware arab israeli citizens * also * got their power free within israel .
