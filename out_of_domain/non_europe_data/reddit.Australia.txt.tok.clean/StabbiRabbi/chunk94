  with a spread like that even if the ratio changed slightly for other years since i think israel is still obviously the clear `` winner '' . 
  if you have a figure for 2015 palestinian casualties ( i could n't find one ) or isis/al-nusrah/fsa fighters killed by the irgc i will happily include and recalculate . 
  however , with ** israel killing 100 times as many people per capita as iran ** in 2014 i would be very , very surprised if iran ended up being a worse per capita killer than israel no matter what extremes we go to to manipulate the figures in an effort to twist the facts in israel 's favour ... 
  i am a confirmed zionist - i 100 % support israel 's right to exist , its right to self-determination and security . 
  i admire many israeli achievements and recognise the many good aspects of israel 's society . 
  israelis for the most part - likud supporters , ultra-zionists/settlers and etc aside - are admirable , decent people . 
  my only disagreements are with the treatment of palestinians ( apartheid in wb , settlements , gaza blockade and etc ) , warmongering with iran and the ruthless efforts at complete repression of any discussion of matters concerning israel that dares deviate from the approved narrative . 
  i see it as being very important to - without supporting attacks against israeli civilians , saying israel should n't be there or anything else nasty like that - present alternative viewpoints that let people gain a more complete picture about what 's going on so they can decide for themselves the truth of the situation in the face of relentless israeli propaganda and efforts to delegitimise any and all dissent . 
  do n't forget corruption . 
  there 's lots of corruption too . 
  the roman empire maintained its senate , but was led by the emperor . 
  the emperor was not called a king ( as the romans had a horror of kings dating back to the start of the republic ) , but effectively had the powers and position of one , including having their heirs inherit the position . 
  psssh ... as a future rich white guy of course $ 40m is peanuts to him . 
  in fact $ 40m only seems like a big head start in life to euro * poors * . 
  and i think we can all agree mr ( soon to be el presidente ) trump would have been just fine even without any such modest opportunities starting out . 
  the man 's a goddamn genius !, 
  to be strictly accurate , when journalists report fabrications about israel they are simply disseminating `` news '' produced by israel 's ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda ; israeli harassment only occurs whenever they try to report on actual events , eg idf soldiers killing civilians in the wb , illegal settler violence near colonies , idf airstrikes against preschools in gaza and so on . 
  edit : forgot a, 
  yes , that must be it . 
  * you 're * right . 
  it 's * everybody else * that 's wrong . 
  if you think past yourself for a moment , the argument is perfectly applicable to people arguing the anti-palestinian case , as you are . 
  only israel does not consider the settlements illegal , attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in gaza are unconscionable or that israel is equally deserving of blame as the palestinians . 
  every other country or international body from the us to the eu to the un has explicitly stated these positions . 
  support for israel 's position in almost exclusively from israelis and right-wing americans . 
  even amongst diaspora jews , unqualified support for israel is far from universal . 
  it really is you and a relative handful of other ideologues who believe the position you argue is right . 
  i find myself being amazed by how people on this fucking website take things so literally . 
  of * course * it was those five words `` banning anything and everything western '' out of the entire paragraph that the comparison with american culture was predicated on . 
  not the core idea expressed by the whole comment that in iran the younger generations are more liberal than their elders ... 
  ~ ~ only in america ... ~ ~, 
  edit : clearly not , read u/fuleamakkup4 's comment bellow . 
  i bet most of her victims were in the bushes , `` taking care of business '' - it would be so easy to sneak up on someone squatting by themselves away from the protection of their dwellings , focussed entirely on snapping one off ... 
  that was very interesting actually - i had absolutely no idea it was so common . 
   i can tell if someone is from spain , but that 's only because i speak spanish and i notice the words they struggle to pronounce . 
  i bet he means the words they struggle to pronounce * in spanish * ; apparently europoorean spanish is noticeably different from proper new world , mexican spanish . 
  i thought un resolutions should just be ignored ? 
  israel has ignored more un resolutions than any other state !, 
  anyway , that was cool . 
  do the illegal settlements geneva convention next !, 
  edit : forgot a word, 
    but moments later , bar-lev was asked if the kuntar killing could be considered `` a tremendous ** success ** for israel . '', 
    yes , certainly , '' the lawmaker replied . 
  definition of success :, 
   / / s\u0259k\u02c8s\u025bs /, 
   the accomplishment of an aim or purpose . 
   `` the president had some success in restoring confidence '', 
   synonyms : favourable outcome , successfulness , favourable result , successful outcome , positive result , victory , triumph, 
   `` we are very encouraged by the success of the scheme '', 
   the good or bad outcome of an undertaking . 
   `` the good or ill success of their maritime enterprises '', 
  success only applies to something you have done ; agreeing the assassination was a success for israel was acknowledgement it was something israel had done . 
  meaning a favourable/positive outcome/result to something you 've done . 
  an outcome or result is what happens after taking an action . 
  semantics aside , the meaning is clear . 
  why are you even arguing about it ? 
  the israeli government just admitted it and allowed that admission to be published via one of its mouthpieces ... 
  they also admit they 're planning to assassinate nasrullah if they get an opportunity . 
  they 're not shy , so why are you being so bashful ? 
  it 's the jpost . 
  they 're not * accusing * anyone of anything . 
  they 're bragging about it . 
  they were allowed to publish without a government complaint ... 
  extrajudicial killings that break other countries ' sovereignty are kind of israel 's mo. 
  i really do n't get why you 're being so squeamish about this one . 
  think back to the greats : eichmann , mordechai vannanu , iranian scientists , black september , numerous hamas leaders throughout countries of the me . 
  this is israel 's foreign affairs legacy . 
  would you deny any of the above ? 
  that 's funny because the previously fervent levels of zionist terrorism calmed right down once * they * had their state . 
   `` we did not give into terrorism during shamir 's days , and it is clear we wo n't today either , '', 
  you could cut the irony with a knife . 
  shamir was , of course , a leading zionist terrorist - the leader of the stern gang ( aka lehi ) no less - who later became the israeli pm and is a beloved figure in israel to this day whose terrorist activities are not condemned , but either ignored , excused or lauded depending on exactly which israeli you speak to . 
  the `` peanut '' camo scheme , as it 's known ... 
  i 've lost hundreds in a day . 
  it 's easy - just head to r/worldnews , pick a palestine/israel thread and disagree with the pro-israel circlejerk in the comments . 
  to really lose points fast post multiple comments in the same thread . 
  you do n't have to say anything very controversial , you certainly do n't need to be a bigot about it - heck , just bring up an indisputable historical fact they would rather gloss over . 
  the same thing goes for any comments about any nationalistic country - try out india and see what happens . 
  now you need to learn about [ clopping ] ( https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search?q=clopping ) ... 
  oh you know , things like the geneva convention , early careers of many of israel 's pms , exact historical timelines of various events . 
  nothing that there is any doubt over . 
  moscow just managed to ratchet things up a notch in terms of horror , did n't they ? 
  that was fucking hardcore . 
  that woman is absolutely . 
  insane . 
  the whole story is straight out of a scary movie :, 
   i saw that she had a bloodied head in her arms but i thought it was not real . 
  people in the crowd said it was real . '', 
  yeah , i wonder what country * he 's * from ? 
  maybe he 's talking about the israeli bombing of iranian troops fighting isis in syria that used to happen before the russians arrived in theatre ? 
  ksa is n't bombing iranians in yemen , just their houthi allies , so they ca n't be from there . 
  definitely not a western country though , nor russia or china . 
  in non-western cultures lots of men wear things more like skirts than trousers - kilts are the most obvious ( and western ) , but in south/south-east asia men have traditionally worn sarongs and [ apparently they are becoming fashionable amongst middle-aged australian men ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/the-commando-and-sarong-dilemma-20090227-8kbg.html ) , though i am a late-thirties australian man and have * never * seen this behaviour in the wild here ... 
  some samurai wore dress like clothing and some chinese robes are too, 
  ancient men 's tunics and roman togas were more akin to dresses than anything else . 
  only northern european barbarians wore trousers in roman times . 
  the legionaries wore skirts , as did alexander the great and the spartan 300 at thermopylae ... 
  men do n't wear skirts because western fashion has for centuries been for men to wear trousers and western clothing styles have spread around the world . 
  ( which is not to say plenty of other cultures do n't also traditionally wear trousers , also tending to be more often men than women ! ), 
  women want to wear trousers more than men want to wear skirts because , gender roles aside , trousers are simply more practical for many activities .
