  or how about telling a professional race car driver that their car won the race ? 
  if it requires a fraction of the skill then why is n't everyone turning out $ 200m photo albums ? 
  a camera is a tool . 
  even the best mechanic would struggle to repair a car with a swiss army knife , but a shitty mechanic with a full set of the best tools around is not going to be any help either . 
  therein lies the difference . 
  does n't really surprise me . 
  the number of idiots driving around in their fully sick vn commodores looking like a cast member from `` fat pizza '' with their hats all the way back on their head so the peak is almost vertical is depressing . 
  that particular model is popular due to having a beefier motor than later models but it has such poor handling that the ass flies out if you push them even a little bit . 
  the sad thing about the ` dream house ' vision is that with all of these new estates popping up your dream house probably has the same plans as your next door neighbour . 
  even those with a bit of money that end up building in a higher end estate will find themselves with a mcmansion , unique just like everyone else 's . 
  for the same amount of money you could get a really nice inner city apartment , that has much better public transport and location . 
  i 've seen inside one of these overpriced ( $ 750,000 ) houses and they are so poorly designed that the extra space is unusable , and really adds nothing to the overall ` feel ' of the house , while important areas like the kitchen or bedrooms are tiny as though they were an afterthought . 
  and the lack of a backyard in an apartment ? 
  these days you are lucky to get an area big enough to have a bbq and a table and chairs . 
  some of these are interesting but the practicality of actually drinking from them seems questionable to me . 
  this appears to be a collection of design-wank . 
  well this one was out west , hoppers crossing way . 
  i ca n't remember the name of the estate but it has a big lake in the middle , so you got a really good view of these boxy eyesores , all crammed in next to each other . 
  perhaps i just have odd taste in houses due to watching too much grand designs ( go iview !, 
  simply change the expression on the girl 's face to fear and you have a horror movie poster . 
  that 's why . 
  so it 's possible i 've jumped the gun here , but since the keynote made zero mention of the classic , one has to assume it has been left by the wayside . 
  i guess we will see when the store comes back . 
  edit : store 's back , along with ipod classics in their original form . 
  presumably the french speaking part . 
  i find that rendition of abbot slightly unnerving for some reason . 
  i think it gives you an edge , but many girls here go crazy over african americans . 
  i do n't think that the fact that it was an advertisement detracted from the video itself though . 
  honestly , if a 5 second flash of the logo is all it takes for a video like this to be made , i 'm all for it . 
  anybody think that song sounds a bit familiar ? 
  nobody had better tell [ rolf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_charming_ ( adam_and_the_ants_song ) ), 
  edit : here 's rolf 's original song , [ war canoe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwi98gtgxh0 ) and the adam ant song , [ prince charming ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nfxcwplcg0 ) that copied it . 
  this song is not a direct rip , but either by coincidence or influence ( conscious or otherwise ) this song is definitely similar . 
  the video for this song wins though . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i am today 's 1,000,000 th visitor !, 
  the ad told me so . 
  why would an ad lie ? 
  rather odd to see my suburb on the front page of reedit . 
  screw you !, 
  harley quinn could be pretty cool . 
  [ noomi rapace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noomi_rapace ) could pull it off , at least in the looks department . 
  i work in a similar type of store and have had this dozens of times . 
  it also totally escaped me why people felt the need to share _ why _ they needed something like that . 
  perhaps like noahfect states below , they are seeking validation . 
  new photo , southern hemisphere . 
  it 's lucky i happened to walk inside just as the second rinse cycle was occurring . 
  well , that was a worthwhile contribution . 
  i hope you feel proud with your work . 
  i initially thought that the chopper referred to was mark ` chopper ' reid . 
  now that would be an interesting article . 
  ah , a fellow dick smithian !, 
  you do n't get any say on what plays on the tvs or the stereo ? 
  all the music is brought in by the staff members here . 
  m.o.e : moccasins on everyone . 
  there has to be someone !, 
  my dad only picked his nose , and went to snotties , to make the snordial , that i like best . 
  erlang is in the clear ... 
  erlang r14b01 ( erts-5 .8.2 ) [ source ] [ smp :2:2 ] [ rq :2 ] [ async-threads :0 ] [ hipe ] [ kernel-poll : false ], 
  eshell v5 .8.2 ( abort with ^ g ), 
  1  erlang : list_to_float ( `` 2.2250738585072012e-308 '' ) . 
  any idea what app that is ? 
  it looks pretty ... pretty . 
  reminds me of a shop i used to work in where the register ( just a normal pc ) had the suspend button right next to the arrow buttons . 
  if you accidentally hit it and you were using the master register , all of the computers would crash . 
  which is why i like to stick to web design . 
  i 've woken up , had a shower and gotten ready for work until i looked at the time and realised it was 3am . 
  i would normally have gotten up at 7 . 
  i think i dreamt that my alarm was going off . 
  parepin is the brand name for a man-made drug that is also sometimes referred to by its generic name , zeridine . 
  developed in a groundbreaking partnership between a major pharmaceutical company and the national institute of health , parepin is a complex drug that bootstraps the immune system . 
  parepin is a revolutionary drug made possible by the advances in medical technology from the study of aids and other immune diseases . 
  while antibiotics target bacteria and antiviral drugs target viruses , parepini \u035cc\u0361a\u035dn \u034ff\u0336\u00e9el \u0338i\u0335t\u034f p\u0337u\u0358mpin\u0334g\u0336 \u0327thr\u031bo\u0336u\u0334g\u0335h\u0334 \u0358my\u0360 vei\u0358n\u0322s is not designed to combat a specific disease or set of diseases . 
  instead , it makes the body better able to combat all disease . 
  parepin has been introduced into water sources all over america . 
  the government claims it is to increase the citizens ' immune system and protect i\u034f \u035e\u1e83as\u0334 \u0327st\u0362an\u0328d\u035di\u0361n\u0358g\u035c r ig\u035fht\u0301 \u0334t\u034fh\u0229re\u0360 w\u0335h\u0336en\u0315 \u0358i\u035et\u034f \u0362c\u0321\u00e1m\u0321e\u0315 d\u0334o\u0337w\u01f9 from\u0338 t\u0361h\u035c\u00e8 \u034fs\u031bkythem from biological terrorism . 
  apparently the drug may do a lot more than just boost the immune system .

  `` define interesting '', 
  `` oh god , oh god , we 're all going to die ? '', 
  i ca n't believe that this is real . 
  surely we are being trolled ... 
  all good . 
  i was actually going to have a jab at the title . 
  something like `` oh , too bad . 
  i actually needed an open source exchange * synchronous * event processing architecture concurrent programming framework '' . 
  if you still have one left : http://scr.im/15j8, 
  thank you muchly good sir . 
  i think that just goes to show how similar all politicians are . 
  this is the first time i 've encountered this technology , but one thing i ca n't figure out . 
  why does the tower need to be so tall ? 
  surely the convection effect would work the same regardless of the size of the tower . 
  as a dandy boy i can verify this ... you fucken cunt . 
  i was thinking more kari byron personally . 
  as i clicked the link to this story i actually said these words out loud . 
  i would recommend going to a thrift shop and picking up a cheapo camera from there . 
  my favorite `` toy '' camera is a plastic panoramic camera that i bought for $ 3 . 
  it works out way cheaper than using disposables , at least where i am . 
  wow . 
  i was just there on sunday taking photos .
