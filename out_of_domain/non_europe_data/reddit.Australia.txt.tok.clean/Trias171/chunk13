  i know that was the main reason the brits lost it to the japs, 
  top to right : chezch , british , american , canadian , belgian , french , german ? 
  what happens if their is a misfire ? 
  are you sure , they 're pretty damn similar . 
  [ dutch ] ( http://www.pyramidmodels.com/shop/shopimages/products/normal/r29---netherlands-roundel.jpg ) , [ czech ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/czech_roundel.svg/430px-czech_roundel.svg.png ) . 
  well shit , good answer . 
  is buzzfeed bad or sumtin ? 
  best one yet, 
  we ( australia ) have newly upgraded aug 's also , called [ ef88 ] ( http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/reports-government-will-sign-deal-for-30000-ef88-austeyr-rifle/story-fnpjxnlk-1227433215626 ) - not the same though ? 
  i will never understand why people say the north would stomp the south , even without outside ( us ) help i believe the south could handle themselves , they are majorly outnumbered but their hardware is top notch , far better training and they would be in a defensive stance . 
  not to mention their navy/airforce would gain naval/air superiority almost immediately . 
  man ... 
  i bought vanilla , then gods and kings and then bnw . 
  each when they first came out ... was not cheap . 
  still , 1000 + hours and going strong , worth it . 
  i 'm going to go ahead and assume you 're a gold rims kinda guy, 
  yeah man !, 
  got to the point where i could n't see a metre in front of me , crazy, 
  seems we 've swapped weather . 
  gramps is in sydney which is nice and sunny today i believe , i 'm way down south in tasmania . 
  na , imported gt legacy . 
  defiently !, 
  , theirs like 4 in my state so really rare also , 
  i had to go to work still : , (, 
  that was me !, 
  til their 's an aussie sub . 
  pretty sure it 's stock !, 
  it 's imported from japan and that 's how it came . 
  yeah i only know of 4 that are actually running and active !, 
  i imagine their would be more though, 
  haha certainly is !, 
  200m above sea level is pretty normal for winter but to come down to sea level is crazy , never happens . 
  would be awesome !, 
  good luck though , would cost a fortune i imagine . 
  you can pick something like [ this ] ( http://www.rslibertyclub.org/forums/showthread.php?103088-fs-melb-92-australian-delivered-subaru-liberty-rs-turbo ) up for around $ 5k australian . 
  rs ' are really cheap here . 
  she pulled it off so well !, 
  she looked young but everything else indicated she was an old lady . 
  you 're either australian , canadian or scandinavian . 
  if you were american you would have recieved a $ 100,000 bill just for taking up a spot in the hospital waiting room . 
  telecommunications . 
  $ 65k per year ( australia ), 
  these guys were meant to be the best troops the germans had , pretty badass . 
  i was on holiday for most of the last two weeks actually :p, 
  hey friend, 
  exactly, 
  100/40 mbps internet . 
  yay partayy, 
  only $ 59 ( us ) a month to . 
  [ civ v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilization_v ) . 
  that is it , it takes over my life . 
  yeah that 's what i thought . 
  i mean things are more expensive in oz but wages are so much better ... generally . 
  yeah but you guys have really high taxes yeah ? 
  to cover free health and the like . 
  and everything is expensive as shit ? 
  also that 's still a decent amount of disposable income !, 
  so cheap rent , expensive food , entertainment etc. 
  yeah that 's cause you guys pay $ 500 a week for a flat :p, 
  i have a 4 bedroom house 10km from hobart cbd and that 's $ 390 pw . 
  good rant !, 
  it seems it very much varies between regions of countries rather than countries themselves for the most part . 
  i 've never even tried civ multiplayer . 
  do n't have the spare time :(, 
  wow that 's crazy . 
  what 's the cost of living ? 
  surely if you 're getting paid that little , food and good are cheap ? 
  +1 for car choice . 
  are sweet cars . 
  you had me at booze is cheap . 
  australia has a stupid alcohol tax which triples the price . 
  i live in the least populated state in australia , so it is the cheapest basically . 
  if i was to move to melbourne or sydney it would be quite different . 
  like i 'd still be okay but would be much less play money . 
  rent is $ 390 per week . 
  split between 4 so $ 97.50 . 
  10km bus ride to work so $ 20 a week maybe . 
  holy shit . 
  i know where i 'm going for holiday . 
  new york city is 58 % more expensive than my city . 
  that 's crazy, 
  yeah we do . 
  but it 's fucking huge and theirs only 500,000 of us . 
  we only have s15s and 240 's in australia , 
  you do n't even need to import . 
  their 's heaps around . 
  can pick up something like [ this ] ( http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/caroline-springs/cars-vans-utes/1999-nissan-silvia-s15-jdm-spec-r/1085673018 ) for $ 15k, 
  from personal experience i 've found you can never be really be friends . 
  civil yes but proper friends , rarely . 
  move over murica , australia is the freedom bringer now . 
  [ neither ] ( http://cdn3-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/2013/03/file_175843_0_striker-eureka.jpg ), 
  nice one , 
  turboed subaru legacy wagon . 
  fast.fun.functional . 
  `` football '' it amazes me how americans call a game where they very rarely touch the ball with their feet football , and a game where play is constantly with feet not football . 
  try being tasmanian . 
  we do n't even have a football team . 
  well til !, 
  we ( australia ) have the the [ mrh-90 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/virtjvc.jpg ), 
  what 's the difference i wonder ?
