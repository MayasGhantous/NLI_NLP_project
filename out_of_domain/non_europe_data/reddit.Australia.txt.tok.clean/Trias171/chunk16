  so any vehicle that is left hand drive needs to to have a caution label . 
  the australian light armoured vehicle ( aslav ) , is an australian version of the light armoured vehicle ( lav-25 ) designed and manufactured by general dynamics land systems canada for the u.s. marines . 
  haha yeah i just copy pasted from the adf site . 
  nothing wrong with extra info though, 
  ethnic units . 
  with the exception of india all participants would be considered allies . 
  and would oppose china if it came down to it . 
  maybe not australia we make to much money from china . 
  yeah right , i always thought india was a mainly russian ally and so as a result anti us . 
  yeah fair enough , that makes sense . 
  what about pakistan ? 
  i mean the us is pretty close with them but at the same time pakistan is close with china . 
  so it 's a bit of a clusterfuck if push came to shove . 
  i ca n't see india and pakistan buddying up against china or visa versa . 
  i 'm not usually a fan of american cars but the z06 is porn, 
  it 's beautiful !, 
  rule 5 : i managed to stretch belgium all the way across africa with connecting railroad in the scramble for africa mod . 
  why are germans using the famas ? 
  or is that the generic gun for this unit i wonder, 
  are these tanks still effective ? 
  i understand they would have some upgrades but how competitive are they compared to modern tanks ? 
  yeah she not [ small ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fn_mag ), 
  nice find !, 
  that 's what the caption says on the [ source ] ( https://www.facebook.com/australiandefenceforcephotography/photos/a.719577661402446.1073741828.719403434753202/1222411154452425/?type=3&amp;theater ), 
  fair call , i thought the t-90 was russian main battle tank however ? 
  to be replaced by the armata, 
  found the australian , 
  x post from r/pics, 
  i know right !, 
  i thought it definitely has a place on r/militaryporn . 
  i believe that 's a helicopter suspension rope , if you look closely theirs a sailor attached to it . 
  pssst ... hey kids , wan na buy some meatballs ? 
  sitting in my comfy chair at work and i could could actually feel the pain . 
  10/10 nope . 
  days like this ? 
  this is life . 
  is iran really going to allow the assad regime to fall ? 
  especially now he has russian backing . 
  i ca n't see a end to this war anytime soon . 
  [ airforce ] ( http://www.airforce.gov.au/imgs/wallpapers/2560-1810/airforceevolutionadg2560x1810.jpg ), 
  i was n't sure which specific carrier it was so i did n't add it . 
  original caption just said nimitz class . 
  i do n't see the issue anyhow ? 
  their you go friend : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=293680836, 
  i like the dutch and american ones . 
  kinda reflects the dutch colonial settlement pas , t and american settlement of the continent, 
  i 'd almost go as far as to make road maintenance free . 
  even with that it 's not a huge advantage . 
  ( depending on how big your empire is ), 
  germany under bismark . 
  ua : * unification of the fatherland * : 25 % combat bonus against civs on the same continent as germany . 
  may annex city states on the same continent as germany if they are `` afraid '' . 
  uu : * landwehr : * disciplined front line rifleman unit . 
  +15 % attack bonus if adjacent to another landwehr ( may stack with other flanking promotions ), 
  ub : * prussian war college * ( replaces military academy ) : +20 % xp to all new units . 
  units built in a city with a prussian war college gain promotions 10 % faster . 
  na that 's fair , it ` as a good idea !, 
  i agree rome just seems so underpowered in civ v, 
  here 's my idea for germany :, 
   germany under bismarck, 
   ua : * unification of the fatherland * : 25 % combat bonus against civs on the same continent as germany . 
  may annex city states on the same continent as germany if they are `` afraid '' . 
   uu : * landwehr * : disciplined front line rifleman unit . 
  +15 % attack bonus if adjacent to another landwehr ( may stack with other flanking promotions ), 
   ub : * prussian war college * ( replaces military academy ) : +20 % xp to all new units . 
  units built in a city with a prussian war college gain promotions 10 % faster . 
  it 's beautiful, 
  agreed on the badassness . 
  debatable on the best tank in the world part . 
  without going head to head on combat their is no sure way of knowing . 
  would be a toss up between the leopard , m1a2 abrams and challenger ii though . 
  true !, 
  and the leclerc , and the japanese type 10 . 
  and then theirs the armata . 
  it 's just hard to say without battlefield proof . 
  22 overpriced main battle tanks shooting deadly rounds of steel at each other instead ? ... 
  brilliant . 
  it 's perfect for the aussie landscape, 
  well yeah :p not sure why this has got downvoted ? 
  this is my first post in r/murica . 
  thought it was pretty relevant ? 
  can also confirm , it 's kinda scary considering a slight fuck up can leave one of your mates injured or dead . 
  it 's a whole new level of training , closest you 'll get to actual combat without actually fighting an enemy . 
  correct . 
  when deploying to other environments we use camo to suit it . 
  such as iraq , we use dpdu : desert version of auscam . 
  such a nice looking ship . 
  it 's sad that battleships are so outdated, 
  i realize that . 
  i meant battleships in general . 
  for those interested :, 
  the prc ( provincial response company ) is a small afghan tactical police unit deployed to selected provinces in afghanistan - mostly in the east and south . 
  these highly-trained police units have proved to be extremely effective and are an important tool in the current counterinsurgency and anti-crime fight . 
  the prcs are one of the least corrupt police units in the ministry of interior and therefore one of the more effective . 
  what 's with the symbol on the front ? 
  all of korea is colored in . 
  is that meant imply something i wonder, 
  do you have a source / more info on that ? 
  not that i do n't believe you , just curious . 
  is the whole fleet based in toulon ?
