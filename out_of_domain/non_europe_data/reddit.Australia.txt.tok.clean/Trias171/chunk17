  i would have thought they would have some up north also . 
  after us and uk i 'm assuming . 
  that makes sense , the french navy was in ruins , japan had lost most of theirs , russias was negligible . 
  edit : you are correct http://www.navalreview.ca/wp-content/uploads/public/vol5num3/vol5num3art2.pdf, 
  ** day of infamy : ** as japan , attack an american battleship in home waters with a zero , without first declaring war . 
  pretty sure it does n't but that 's a cool idea !, 
  poor poland :(, 
  ** ca n't touch this ** : go a whole game without one of your units receiving damage from a ranged attack, 
  yeah true , i mean just attacking a unit without going to diplomacy screen and declaring war or is that the same effect ? 
  being at constant war that long would be interesting . 
  you 'd wan na be winning when it came to turn 116 or the ai will pull the classic `` fuck yo peace offer '', 
  good question . 
  sydney ( fleet base east ) is the main naval base for australia like the usa 's naval station norfolk . 
  i guess any response required by the ships will more than likely be from the pacific ocean islands or to the north . 
  our west coast is covered by our subs cause it 's a big ass ocean with not much in it . 
  jfd civs are my favorite , mainly because most of them offer ynaemp compatibility . 
  this is favourite : ** http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=83745797&amp;searchtext=prussia**, 
  it 's the only part of australia i have n't been to so that makes sense :p, 
  well i 'm open to suggestions ? 
  just could n't be bothered i guess, 
  not particularly . 
  a large percentage of tasmania 's old infrastructure and buildings were constructed using convicts , plus whole areas such as port arthur were convict sites . 
  civ ii on ps1 when i was like 12 , man i used to be obsessed . 
  and now the addiction is even worse . 
  did n't even think about leaders actually . 
  good ideas !, 
  the jet was being lifted from the australian aviation heritage centre destined for raaf base tindal for extensive restoration . 
  the restoration project was to be carried out by current members of the squadron based at raaf tindal , and is an invaluable training tool for all personnel involved in airlifting , structural repair and restoration of jet fighters . 
  i 'm assuming this dude would be special forces or apart of a task group ? 
  m4 is n't the main service rifle of columbia if memory serves . 
  are these all ynaemp compatible ? 
  i 'd love to play these along with the allied civs on a ynaemp large europe map with the end in ww1 and ethnic units mod . 
  domination only of ofcourse . 
  their is a end in ww1 mod on steam workshop : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=79534503, 
  r/murica is leaking, 
  more like 20 % in the case of the uk anyway . 
  brilliant !, 
  that and affordable health care . 
  of course we do , however it 's barely noticeable . 
  i lose maybe 15 % of my pay to tax , to this day i 've never paid for healthcare . 
  the wait time is never that long . 
  i 'd rather wait a few hours and pay a slightly higher tax than get home from hospital and wonder why i have a $ 20,000 bill for a broken leg . 
  i live in australia so i 'd say the quality of healthcare is on par with the us . 
  yeah and their 's the difference . 
  in australia you will still get decent healthcare even if you do n't have insurance . 
  you might be fine now , but what happens one day if you lose your job and do n't have insurance anymore , bad luck mate suck it up . 
  also about [ quality ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/best-healthcare-systems-in-the-world-2012-6#33-chile-4 ), 
  haha , us uniform was defiantly not designed for australia . 
  i 'd love to tell you , but i have no idea . 
  that bloke looks remarkably aussie . 
  would it suit your environment ? 
  depending on where you live i guess, 
  so effectively the u.s chose the worse performing camo for their soldiers ? 
  x post from r/straya, 
  we really love our politicians in australia, 
  battlefield : australia, 
  where ... 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but their 's an american there to ( the one in the m1 helmet ), 
  haha touch\u00e9, 
  i 'm aussie bad grammar is a given . 
  sauce god damn it, 
  we have m1a1s so no uranium armour . 
  other than that pretty much the same . 
  not sure about the leopards , seems odd . 
  i regret this typo :p, 
  fuck that guy, 
  belgium had the coolest uniform of ww1 imo , i know black is n't practical nowadays but damn it 's cool . 
  why did n't the brits keep these and use them for themselves ? 
  lack of ammo i guess ? 
  there you [ go ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theaustralianarmy/photos/pcb.10153583268931195/10153583266261195/?type=3&amp;theater ), 
  really makes you understand why their was such a high casualty rate in world war one, 
  looks like a map of australia, 
  more than likely from an overseas operation . 
  source did n't go into detail . 
  we got 's ourselves one of dem [ reposts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/3v8ad6/australian_2nd_commando_regiment_conducting/ ), 
  when you say 20 civs ? 
  are their pre - loaded civs to choose from or ? 
  it actually handles really well on stock suspension setup , mind you these are n't standard vechiles : sti 6 speed and stiff . 
  bilstein springs , 0-100km in 6.9 sec . 
  i 'm definetly going to improve handling but would like to squeeze more powaaas eventually, 
  video of ? 
  you are correct !, 
  it look black until up close though . 
  i 'll get one soon , 
  bc golds : http://bcracing.com.au/ra-coilovers, 
  240 hp , 0-100 kmph ( 60mph ) in 6.7 secs . 
  not super quick but does the job, 
  correct !, 
  can anyone explain the helmets ? 
  looks like a mix of british ww1 helmets and us wwii m1 's, 
  rule 5 : size 11 city with 22 food . 
  highest i 've ever had for a small city . 
  also bonus civ desktop ( whoops ), 
  close enough !, 
  how would one obtain one of these gear knobs ? 
  excellent , cheers !, 
  germany ... cause . . well ... panzers . 
  which part ? 
  oh wow , good spotting !, 
  one can only hope,
