  this guy gets it ^, 
  i love melbourne , best city in aus , especially compared to hobart . . 
  it 's also not delicious , cascade is a true australian beer and is delicious . 
  i personally have never seen either of those , it 's mainly in the desert and tropic areas . 
  viva le france, 
  the only issue with that is it 's an american beer , american beer tastes like diluted , bitter kiddies cordial . 
  said every american ever, 
  it is amazing , however it 's only for people who earn under $ 27,274 ( us $ 23895 ) per year , and it 's not 100 % free , dentists and specialists etc do still cost money but are heavily discounted , and we do have to pay for medication , like $ 5 for a months supply , it 's a hard life in oz . 
  did i mention education is free right up until university . 
  iggy is the worst thing to come out of australia . 
  i 'm guessing those are sydney and melbourne ? 
  they 're the biggest . 
  ummm . . wolverine ( hugh jackman ) , heath ledger ( the joker ) thor ( chris hemsworth ) , the hulk ( eric bana ) . . just to name a few :p . 
  interesting question , now that i think about it 's usually just australian , or by what state you 're from , in my case tasmanian . 
  it 's usually other countries that call us `` ozzies '' ( american term ), 
  what was his name out of curiosity ? 
  best australian movie ever . . oh wait , hollywood . 
  , very common name . 
  iain if that 's how it 's meant o be spelt , never heard of it before . 
  do you have any mods with this ? 
  the battleships look different , ethnic units , or ? 
  how did you get australia to work in tsl ? 
  it 's a mod with tsl : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=301587188, 
  i renamed that myself . 
  i have two port cities ? 
  mods , mods and more mods . 
  correct . 
  here 's a link http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=301587188, 
  it works with other mods also, 
  good old city state unit gifting, 
  i found this way more funnier than it should have been . 
  ahhhh roger !, 
  yeah , rome kinda invaded them , i feel for them . 
  it 's a mod , the best one imo . 
  does n't affect achievements either . 
  ah that makes sense , cool thanks, 
  i 'm concerned about your lack of battleships/carriers ( aircraft ) for attack support and protection . 
  and then i just realized ghandi 's biggest city only has 29 defense ... 
  carry on . 
  good on you for doing something different . 
  makes 0 sense but hey what tattoos do these days . 
  impostor !, 
  brainception, 
  ohhh so that 's what they look like, 
  suddenly a rush of childhood doctor who memories comes back , that was legit the most scary thing i watched on tv as a kid . 
  reminds of this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080180/?ref_=tt_rec_tt, 
  i do n't know if anyone has seen a tv show called musketeers ( produced by bbc ) but it is set in this time period , this map makes things much easier to understand !, 
  might want to double check that . 
  stockholm is definitely in swedish territory on this map . 
  1 = revolution days . 
  2 = mexican wars era 3 = civil war 4 = wwi 5 = wwii 6 = korea 7 = post vietnam 8 = desert storm 9-desert storm + 10 = present . 
  negative - think southern hemisphere . 
  also negative, 
  20 points . 
  how 'd you get it ? 
  here in down under we do n't get snow - dirt for the win . 
  impressive - good work !, 
  i thought the landscape may throw people off towards the northern hemisphere , so i achieved that !, 
  not the first time that many russians have had to wait for the germans . 
  my first thoughts lead me to south american/carribean area ? 
  always - v8 's do n't suspect a thing , 
  this map is perfect !, 
  no lag , runs smooth , a bit of visual glitches nothing major . 
  soon !, 
  - i just finished with the other european peasants !, 
  give a man a break, 
  i have nukes and jet fighters :d,

  mods used -, 
  map / http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=520274, 
  ethnic units , battleships to missile cruisers , r.e.d modpack , 3 units to one tile . 
  this guy gets it ^, 
  it also has three times as much production as the next city - go figure . 
  yep , soviet union , mongolia is the little blob in the middle ? 
  austria was never in existence - soaked up into the glorious german empire . 
  yeah no issue with happiness . 
  i started with like 90 happiness also - weird . 
  it 's all because of the mod , the maker tried to make it as close to rl as possible at the start of wwii - so germany = happy . 
  russia = sad . 
  aha maybe i should reconsider invasion, 
  none of the nations have changed to rl wwii leaders , something the maker overlooked i guess . 
  i have no idea tbh - came with the taken territory . 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
  i ahave another half a dozen rocket artillery 's being moved from the southern front so should be a breeze . 
  you 'll never know, 
  they denounced me !, 
  and they were soooo weak and annoying . 
  catholic pope visiting a muslim country - seems odd, 
  i know right !, 
  now i must prey to the civ gods for it to be in existence . 
  look and you shall find :d http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=137956288, 
  this is perfect for r/civ, 
  that actually sounds awesome-someone needs to make this happen . 
  i have a civ boner right now, 
  well i know where i 'll be settling-this makes the inner admiral in me happy . 
  it should download as a mod - find the mod in the civ v steam folder copy the map file to the maps folder , then load it from your menu , it should show up in the map list . should work with all all . 
  no one likes russia anyway, 
  as a germany byast player - with tsl , i am excited for this . 
  i thought as as much , 
  as if you 've never noticed strategic view before.do you even civ ?
