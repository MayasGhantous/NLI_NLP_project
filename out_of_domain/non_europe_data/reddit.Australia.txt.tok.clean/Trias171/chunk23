  total military numbers :, 
  present day : 222,000 vs 1939 : 4,722,000 . 
  what is you 're favorite unit and why ? 
  it can include uniques , only for firaxis civs though , to keep it simple . 
  for example :, 
  ** unit : panzer ** ( germany ), 
  ** why : ** i like to stay at peace and build up my economy until the modern age , with germany it 's relatively easy as they have potentially high production output . 
  once i get combined arms tech i literally spam panzers and bombers and go all blitzkrieg on everyone ( sorry poland ) . 
  the extra strength and movement make it much stronger and faster than anything up until mech inf or mbt . 
  10,000 marines ,100 m1a2 abrams & 100 ac-10 thunderbolts vs the nazi german army during battle of france . 
  for the uneducated :, 
  edit : change it up to make it more feasible - the entire present day marine corp vs the nazi german army during battle of france . 
  each side has a battalion of infantry ( lets say 500 ), 
  israeli infantry is brought to battle in [ namers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/namer ) and are supported by 30 [ merkava iv 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkava#merkava_mark_iv ) ( some troops may placed in merkavas instead of namers if desired , up to 4 per tank . 
  ( may carry anti tank troops for example ), 
  us infantry is brought to battle in [ strykers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stryker ) and are supported by 30 [ m1a2 abrams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams ), 
  each side has all relevant battalion logistical and medical support . 
  no air support . 
  scenario 1 : completely open desert battlefield . 
  scenario 2 : isreali troops are held up in a defensive position in a urban environment ( small isreali town ) , with the us required to attack and defeat them . 
  scenario 3 : visa versa of scenario 2 . 
  * the us and israel have arguably the most experienced fighting forces on the planet : especially in a desert/urban environment . 
  i 'm interested to see peoples opinions on the victor in numerical even situation . 
  edit : us : $ 43734 per year ( before tax ), 
  how much free cash would you have after rent/bills/food etc ? 
  a platoon ( 30 ) of special forces troops ie ; navy seals , sas etc is dropped into a field in napoleonic france ( early 1800s ) they have infinite ammo and their normal gear including standard platoon support weapons such as machine guns and mortars . 
  how long can they last before they are overrun ? 
  do n't be afraid to alter the conditions, 
  can be anything , for example : 2 units per tile , eui etc. 
  feel free to elaborate on why . 
  present day - the russians launch an invasion of finland similar to how they did in 1939 . 
  the finns get wise 10 days before the invasion and begin defensive preparations . 
  the finns may seek financial and material support from other countries . 
  nato does not get involved and no nukes allowed . 
  scenario 2 : same as above however norway and sweden ally with finland and fully commit to their defense . 
  can russia be stopped ? 
  hey all , i 'm thinking of getting into modding - i 've had a few ideas for australian states . 
  feel free to offer some tips or suggestions to what i have , and if any master modders want to use these ideas to make a mod that 'd be even better .

  any recomendations on mods for this vechile ? 
  germany invades denmark but instead of a small 1940 's army denmark is defended by the modern 2016 defense force . 
  denmark has all relevant modern day supplies and communications but can not obtain help from other nations.they have the same prep time as they did in 1940 . 
  how long can they hold out ? 
  read somewhere it was something like 130 british and french divisions vs 27 german . 
  i 'm just wondering if anyone can suggest a good less known camping spot for over the easter weekend ? 
  does anyone else feel more confident about playing adelaide than carlton than last week ? 
  i do n't know how or why but we seem to play better against teams we 're meant to get pummeled by . 
  port adelaide , geelong , west coast etc. 
  even the close losses to sydney , richmond , gws were admirable . 
  our best is as good as anyone but we still manage to lose to the likes of brisbane , carlton ( nearly twice ) and fremantle . 
  he is one of our best players but is out of contract . 
  do we think he will stay on ? 
  i 've heard that he loves the club and i imagine he 'll stay , may have to open the wallet a bit wider though considering his awesome form .
