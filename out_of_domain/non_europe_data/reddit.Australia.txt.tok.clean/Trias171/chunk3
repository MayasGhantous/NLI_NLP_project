  i 'm optimistic they 'll include australia , understandably we do n't have hugely broad history , but i can hope !, 
  along the lines of this mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158308002&amp;searchtext=australia, 
  i would be fully supportive of a canadian civ also . 
  i mean they 've included all the old north and south american tribes which although have a long history , have arguably had less influence on the world than say australia and canada . 
  all the major ones that is . 
  this gives me a civ boner . 
  sigh ... here we go again . 
  holy shit , that bridge tho . 
  hmas maryborough ( acpb 95 ) armidale class patrol boat . 
  well shit , i 'm sorry i do n't take notice of every post made . 
  yeah it 's a good show !, 
  yeah you 're right , i 've never played aztec before so that 's my bad.this is actually a save i found on r/civsaves that looked cool and i gave it a go . 
  love your work with the fortresses , it 's almost a must in those situations , even if you have no real threat . 
  gaul on a hilly/mountain map - so keen . 
  what civ were you ? 
  well i 've found my next tattoo . thankyou kindly . 
  looks like you lost to a russian domination victory :p, 
  i concur , also 50 % welsh - ca n't pronounce a single word correctly . 
  this would be pre wwii i imagine , the soviets were innovators in airborne infantry - not they got much of a chance to use it . 
  it 's certaintly possible , but still rather stupid , i 'm the closest civ to the city and we 're allies so it 's just wasting gold really . 
  can confirm ^, 
  zulus are the warmongers , they took london and invaded me , i repelled them and took london from them - resources were more tempting than diplomacy points for liberating london . 
  well i ca n't argue with that ^ . 
  missile cruiser would be even more deadly - dat range . 
  tristan friends !, 
  like what ? , looks fine to me ? 
  i ca n't believe i 'm asking this seeing as though i have a 1000 + hours ( embarrassing ) , what civ are you ? 
  i actually ca n't tell by color and their is no rl city names . 
  edit - never mind you 're the ottomans , ignore me . 
  carry on . 
  i have tried a few of them , i want to keep with in game civs for now though . 
  did not know this !, 
  cool !, 
  hopilite & companion calvary for early conquest mmm yeah . 
  open to suggestion !, 
  i 've won at each victory type . 
  i guess i 'm kinda getting at is : what have people played as , and had a good experience . 
  what settings do they play under to get the most out of the civ like aztecs on a lake map, 
  how was it ? 
  i 've never been tempted to play as them . 
  oh those farms !, 
  my panzers are on the way . 
  back when marines were actually useful . 
  they are so good on island maps !, 
  - awesome for trade routes also, 
  that would make a cool tattoo sleeve !, 
  god damn russians . 
  all i did was launch a couple of thousand little panzers into their territory and they got all mad and destroyed my capital , overreaction much . 
  i 'd have to say venice , i never have an issue with them - maybe because they 're trade biased . 
  the polish already have one http://www.funker530.com/pl-01-future-stealth-tank-unveiled-by-poland/, 
  i totally agree , and usually i do play with mods . 
  but i guess what i mean is like earning those achievements properly through experience/skill rather than shorcutting just to get the achievement . 
  i 'm 90 % through a game and i have n't touched tradition , i went straight to liberty and now i have a 40 capital with food for days . 
  admittedly i had a good start but it was on immortal and i have not suffered at all . 
  i believe it 's situational , i chose liberty to get worker bonus because i had lots of resources and for settlers to expand quickly . 
  if you were playing occ for example you would go straight for tradition ( obviously ), 
  the leopard would give it a run for it 's money , bloody good tank . 
  no wonder they cost more than most people will earn in their lifetime . 
  cough please do cough, 
  immortal difficulty/no mods . 
  map from r/civ saves ( one of the aztec ones ), 
  edit : i 'm going to war with my city state allies against the other civs not against the actual city states . 
  note : i 'm allied with all of the city states - ( big giant red arrow ), 
  `` football '', 
  i am going to war with my allies against the other civs , note how i 'm allied with all of them . 
  i probably should have specified , ma bad . 
  you can rename it at any time actually , at least i can . 
  op - http://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/2r6uln/map_by_oscar_saktoth/, 
  good job !, 
  i 'll give it a go . 
  the movie is not to bad to http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109779/, 
  something i noticed - the soviet bayonet pierces straight through towards the mouth , the allies however do not . 
  is this maybe some suggestion that the soviets are doing more to defeat the nazis ? 
  israel - leader : ben gurion, 
  ua : ( independence at all costs ) when war is declared upon israel all units cost 50 % less production to build . 
  all units receive double experience points whilst at war with another civ . 
  ub : synagogue a synagogue provides 2 gold per turn , 1 culture per turn , and 1 faith per turn . 
  ( no upkeep , replaces temple . 
  modern armour replacement . 
  110 strength / 5 movement, 
  receives the patriotic war promotion ( 15 % attack strength in friendly territory ), 
  has the ability to carry one infantry/marine/paratrooper unit . 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
  it seems far fetched but quite plausible . 
  very true , although arguably the soviets would be a lot less closer to berlin at the time of this poster if it were not for allied material supplies . 
  i do this with my units . 
  naming them like - `` elite guard '' , `` 1st grenadiers '' , `` 3rd armored '' for example . 
  but by the time you get to the modern era and you have 50 + units it get 's a little bit hard to manage . 
  r/civsaves please and thankyou . 
  inspired from : http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/2rkbt9/israel_civ_idea/, 
  this is my take on an israel custom civ . 
  let me know what you think/what could be improved .

  it would be fun i think ! . 
  panzers are just to much fun .
