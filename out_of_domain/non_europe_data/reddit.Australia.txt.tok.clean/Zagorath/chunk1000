  it says you only add it once , which is the but you 're talking about . 
  it also says you only multiply it once . 
  that means if there are two abilities saying you double it , you can only double it once . 
  theoretically if there were an ability that triples it , and one that doubles it , you would only triple it , not sextuple it . 
  because you can only multiply once ( but choose the best one ) . 
  it 's like ac calculation in that way . 
   on the third hand, 
  uhh ... you should probably get that looked at . 
  these feats very definitively ** do not ** stack with expertise . 
   your proficiency bonus ca n't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once . 
  occasionally , your proficiency bonus might be modified ( doubled or halved , for example ) before you apply it . 
  if a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once , you nevertheless add it only once , ** multiply it only once ** , and halve it only once . 
   if wielding only one or two daggers, 
  i would break this out so that it comes before the '' : '' and the first bullet point , as something that applies to all dagger attacks . 
  i would also reword it to be `` if wielding nothing but one or two daggers '' , to emphasise the fact that you ca n't do it with one dagger and one other thing ( which a literal interpretation of your wording would allow , despite clearly not being the intended behaviour ) . 
   the cooking feat should n't allow you to make a special meal that gives some little buffs, 
  because the `` buff '' is the benefit of the feat . 
  a better equivalent would be that having the feat does n't lock out other players from making meals entirely . 
  it could make you * better * at making certain items , so you can do it more quickly and/or at a higher quality , but there 's no reason that anyone could n't attempt to make more or less the same item . 
  i 'd way rather see brandon routh . 
  imo best superman actor this century . 
  ( shame about the lacklustre film . ), 
  ray palmer be damned . 
  spacey and routh were the best things about that movie . 
  they were both * perfect * for their roles . 
  i think they 're the best actors we 've seen in those roles this century , and well up there among the best we 've ever seen . 
  sure , the writing was bad , but those two actors make the movie bearable . 
  i still want john stewart diggle to be a thing . 
  i still do n't think deadshot is really dead . 
  when i was first watching that episode , it did n't even * occur * to me that he might actually be dead . 
  it was just * obvious * that he had faked it somehow to escape . 
  it was only afterwards , reading the post-thread chat , that other people mentioned how they must have * had * to kill him off because of the dccu . 
  that was the first time the idea that he was actually dead really occurred to me . 
  i did n't think killing him off was controversial . 
  it was more just the terrible movie as a whole . 
  if the movie had been better made , and kept the correct tone for superman and batman 's characters , the death of superman at the end would n't have raised an eyebrow , i do n't think . 
  fwiw the latest version of drupal is ** amazing ** . 
  gets rid of so much annoying shit from previous versions , and works in a much more structured way . 
  there 's way less mega arrays of death going on . 
  also , php has been replaced with twig for templating , and with yaml for metadata . 
  aye , that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  came out novemberish last year . 
  i wish i could take credit for it , but it was / u/coldermoss in the / r/dndnext thread that found it . 
  i just copied and pasted it , and narrowed down the part that they had emphasised . 
  yeah i would agree with that . 
  python is dynamically typed , but it also makes use of strong typing . 
  i 've heard far less about people having problems with how python handles things than i have javascript . 
  seasons 1 and 2 are ** amazing ** . 
  season 3 had some serious flaws , but was mostly okay . 
  season 4 started out great , the first half of it is fine . 
  but it went * way * downhill as the season went on . 
  the subreddit takes things * way * further than they deserve to be taken . 
  it 's not * nearly * as bad as they make it out to be . 
  but make no mistake : the show 's last third of a season ( maybe a bit more than that ) was pretty terrible . 
  becoming a sub for the grand tour is too on the nose imo . 
  it should become a sub dedicated to something more indirectly related and/or unexpected . 
  i read it as jellyfish and was very surprised to read about jellyfish behaving in a way that seems to imply a certain degree of intelligence and/or at least a centralised nervous system . 
  was even more surprised to see a creature that looks like a frog . 
  cute images . 
  the facts do n't have to be cute . 
  for a long time , i 've always used beethoven 's symphony no . 
  9 to break in new speakers and headphones . 
  maybe it varies by state ? 
  everyone else here is saying you 're wrong , but my experience by far agrees with you . 
  the website i went through to find a room mate defaulted to everything in a price per week , and nobody that i 've talked to has ever mentioned any other way of doing things . 
  yeah unfortunately change is hard , and drupal 8 is a big change . 
  personally , i learnt 8 after getting * just enough * experience with 7 to know how much of a pain those arrays could be , and it was a total dream by comparison . 
  but had i been super invested in the 7 way of doing things i 'm sure i 'd be just as reluctant as many . 
  go away theseus , nobody likes you . 
   i screwed up . 
  i went on holidays and did n't bother checking the mountain of mail that accumulated over two weeks . 
  by the time i got around to it , i found a letter buried in the pile . 
  i had been summoned for jury duty . 
   the letter said i had to attend court in two days ' time . 
  is this how it actually happens ? 
  the closest i 've come to jury duty was i once received a letter basically asking me if i had any reasons not to be able to attend , and that they would send another letter if i was actually summoned : would hear nothing back otherwise . 
  they did n't send an actual summons right of the bat . 
  i replied to that letter months after it was actually supposed to be replied to , owing to being overseas and not receiving it until way later . 
  so i do n't know anything about what would have happened in normal circumstances . 
  this was in qld , fwiw . 
  i 've not dealt with google play from a dev 's perspective , but it sounds like they 're about the same level of fucked-up-retarded as youtube is when it comes to `` copyrighted '' * material . 
  \\* sometimes actually copyrighted but fair use , sometimes not even actually copyrighted . 
  oh this is great . 
  i had a character idea that i could n't pin down mechanically . 
  was tossing up between rogue/fighter , rogue/non-magic-ranger , or some combination of all three . 
  a non-magic-ranger that * is * a fighter would probably be perfect . 
  a non-magic-ranger as a rogue would work too without needing to multiclass , as long as it gets access to the same fighting styles that the core ranger does . 
   prestige classes ... probably wo n't come back in 5th, 
  i really hope you 're wrong about that . 
  they 're a truly fantastic tool if used properly . 
  i think runic magic as a whole is kinda lame , but a prestige class was the perfect way to do it . 
  not to mention [ many of the prc homebrews we 've seen ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3aprestige ) ( prcs are especially good for things like vampirism and lycanthropy , or things that relate only tangentially to main class features such as specialist crafters and the like ) . 
  as long as they maintain strong flavour and avoid things that are basically `` existing option , but better '' -- no archmages . 
  ## the new properties, 
   if that creatures move within your polearm 's reach on its next turn, 
  if that creature moves *, 
   ** defensive ** . 
  on your turn , you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance , provided you have the weapon in hand . 
  doing so grants you a +1 bonus to your ac until the start of your next turn or until you 're not holding the weapon, 
  i thought this was a dumb way of using reactions when wizards did it in the ua .
