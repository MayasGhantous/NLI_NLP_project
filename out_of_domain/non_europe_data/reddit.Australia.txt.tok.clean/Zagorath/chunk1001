  i think it 's a dumb idea here . 
  better would be a bonus action , i think : especially in this context , since it 's not being used to balance out the bonus on opportunity attacks that the ua feat needed . 
   the targets movement is reduced by half until the beginning of your next turn , and if they have a shield they lose its ac bonus until they make a strength check equal to dc 8 + your proficiency bonus + your strength modifier, 
  missing a full stop at the end of that . 
  but more importantly , i feel this needs some flavour clarification . 
  what exactly are they doing when they make this strength check ? 
  and , for that matter ( though this can at least be inferred from the text above it ) what is it that they 're doing that stops the half speed ? 
   ** loading **, 
  already has a definition in the phb , and you seem to be trying to use it to do something more like the * reloading * property from the dmg . 
  additionally , requiring a * full action * to reload ? 
  that 's * insane * . 
  keeping * loading * as it is in the phb , use * reloading * from the dmg , and allow a bonus action to be used to reload . 
   ** mechanical **, 
  hmm ... i 'm in general not a fan of weapons breaking so easily . 
  i would suggest a couple of possibilities . 
  * upon rolling a 1 or 2 , roll another die , probably d6 or d8 ( maybe have it specified which in brackets , and make the more powerful ones use a smaller die -- break more easily ) , and a 1 on * that * means it does indeed break, 
  * upon rolling a 1 or 2 , use some sort of modified roll using a stat that you deem relevant, 
   ** two-handed **, 
  you 've accidentally added the stuff from * unpredictable * in here . 
   ** unpredictable **, 
  i quite like the feature , but the name does n't really make sense to me in relation to the feature . 
  how does unpredictability relate to knocking down an opponent depending on how strong they are ? 
   weighted-blow . 
  whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon and hit , you can knock the target prone if the lower of the two, 
  i think you accidentally a phrase . 
  # the weapon tables, 
  ** needs to be left-aligned ** . 
  centred like this makes it much harder to read . 
  you do this in markdown by only putting colons on the * left * side of each cell in the row below the header row . 
  quarterstaves apparently now deal * less * damage with two hands than with one ? 
  scythes do an * awful * lot of damage for a weapon that is supposed to be simple . 
  also , weird capitalisation with the two-handed property . 
  flails should probably use the '' + '' sign to more clearly indicate their damage is the sum of the two damages . 
  you 've misspelled `` defensive '' as `` defencive '' a few times . 
  there may be other typos that you should really check out . 
  you 've made whips even more useless than they already were . 
  it seems the repeating hand and light crossbows are mechanical , but the repeating heavy crossbow is not . 
  is this intentional , or an oversight ? 
  shurikens seem pretty useless . 
  they have `` loading 5 '' ( you forgot the brackets , btw ) , but the loading property as you have defined it does not allow shooting multiple times per action : all it does is require reloading after a certain number of shots . 
  if you want that , you need to create a new property that specifies it 's about firing multiple shots per attack . 
  ## other considerations, 
  * which of these weapons get added to the weapon lists of various classes ? 
  of particular importance to note are the monk , rogue , and bard . 
  * your feat grants * waay * too much stuff . 
  never mind the +1 to attack rolls , which was * widely * panned as a bad move from the ua , you 're also granting permanent oa advantage ( something one of the feats in the ua gave only if they * did n't * choose to use one of the other benefits from that feat ) , extra flexibility in the form of an extra reaction ( i actually quite like this bit of the feat ) , and a new tool proficiency that 's only tangentially related to the feat 's core design , * at best * . 
  over all , there are a few things i like about this , but for the most part it seems unnecessarily complicated , and increases the power level too much . 
  it 's granting a bunch of things that the ua article gave as a feat for free , and i do n't think that 's a good decision . 
  i use google now * all the time * . 
  the weather , to find out about upcoming games ( though it annoys me that they refer to rugby league as just `` rugby '' -- the latter , more properly known as `` rugby union '' , is a completely different sport ) , and the suggested articles are something i use very regularly . 
  it 's also occasionally interesting as a curiosity to see how long it will take to get home from where i am , or to get to an event that 's upcoming . 
  and the other features like notifying about upcoming flights , bills , etc. 
  are more rarely useful , but super awesome when they do appear . 
  apart from maybe the sport , i ca n't see how any of those are region locked , though knowing google i would n't be * super * surprised if they just arbitrarily block those features working in some countries . 
  but at least in australia , where we 're * usually * a third-rate country as far as google support goes ( us and canada being first-rate , western europe being second ) , it 's incredibly useful to me . 
  i agree regarding daydream , i 've never once touched it . 
  i do n't even know what battery saver is . 
  i 'd love to use nfc . 
  i just do n't know what i 'd use it for . 
  i 've used it once or twice since i first got this phone to push stuff to another device that has it , but that 's about it . 
  it 's like ifttt or tasker to me . 
  awesome in theory , but if i do n't know what to do with it , kinda useless to me . 
  i have calendar and keep on my main screen , and mini players for pocketcasts and audible on a secondary one . 
  the latter i could probably replace with just using their notification without losing much , though ... 
   the contextual stuff, 
  i genuinely have never understood what now on tap * is * . 
  occasionally i 'll highlight something and it comes up with the option to google for that word/phrase . 
  is that now on tap ? 
  and what exactly is its `` contextual stuff '' ? 
  damn , you guys ca n't get it live ? 
  australia 's pay tv network foxtel shows in live at like 11am on monday , and then re-airs it at prime time that evening . 
  that said , i do n't know anyone who actually watches it that way . 
  foxtel is stupid fucking expensive ( makes american cable look like a good deal ) . 
  everyone just torrents , where you can be watching it within an hour after it 's finished airing . 
  if you 're that far behind , you probably have n't been doing a lot of googling for related topics . 
  google now suggests articles for you to read based upon what it thinks you 're interested in . 
  it 's quite likely that it has n't yet picked up that you 're interested in got , and thus you are n't yet getting the types of articles that could be spoilers . 
  i 'm * almost * with you . 
  the only custom thing i 've got going is my keyboard . 
  everything else is stock google . 
  do you know what not is * supposed * to do ? 
  i 've never quite worked it out . 
  c -- call ? 
  you can do that with these things ? 
  [ here 's the actual piece being practised in the clip ] ( https://youtu.be/ljomxgfflri?t=95 ) , for anyone not familiar . 
  2:32 - ish is where things start going differently . 
  ah right . 
  i do n't have m . that would explain why i 've never seen it . 
  ah right . 
  i do n't have m . that would explain why i 've never seen it . 
  thanks . 
  haha sorry about that . 
  probably should have used an ellipsis instead ... 
  but , there 're already ranges of ip addresses for that purpose . 
  192.0.2.0 / 24 , 198.51.100.0 / 24 , and 203.0.113.0 / 24 . 
  like 555 in phone numbers . 
  australia actually has more ( though not per capita ) . 
  in practice , yes . 
  ctrl and cmd are usually swapped in keyboard shortcuts like copy , paste , print , etc. 
  however , the direct * equivalent * is that cmd maps to the win key .
