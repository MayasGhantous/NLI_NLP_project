  could we do times in utc please ? 
  that way anyone can easily convert to their own timezone to know when it is . 
  i 'd hardly put any stock in this . 
  all they 've got are some screenshots from the cartoon and a youtube video of some of the best bits of the show , used to pad out literally just 74 words of pure speculation with no real evidence behind it . 
  not even a particularly sincere claim that their evidence is strong , just `` according to reports '' . 
  here it is , if anyone would rather not give them the click . 
   according to reports , warner bros. and dc entertainment continue to develop a live action adaptation of dc comics ' `` young justice '' , with a gaggle of comic book superheroes to star :, 
   '' ... ` young justice ' will be a live action teen drama/romance series with a superhero twist , based on the ` young justice ' cartoon , games and comics with both ` superboy ' and ` miss martian ' as leaders of the team ... 
   does the addition of double your proficiency stack with existing proficiency ? 
  there 's no need to ask that . 
  the rule of the game is no . 
  unless someone made it explicitly clear otherwise , there 's no reason to think that they 'd be overruling that . 
  # overall score : 8.33 / 10, 
  ## wording/formatting : 9/10, 
  i can find nearly no fault with this . 
  a couple of tiny sections of minor wording issues , and i 'm not a fan of its use of `` magicks '' ( it 's flavourful , but unnecessary , imo ) . 
  the biggest formatting mistake , by far , is in with the alignment and size tables . 
  text that * should * be left aligned is instead centred . 
  this is problematic , and makes it more awkward to parse visually . 
  and if that 's its biggest problem , well then it 's clearly doing well . 
  it is also , however , missing a racial quote at the beginning . 
  something from or about a fairly typical member of this species , in the style that one would expect of a novel about one of these crockians , or with a crockian as a major character . 
  it 's something that every race in the phb contains , and every good homebrew race write-up should also . 
  ## theme/creativity : 7.5 / 10, 
  got ta be honest , i do n't like the idea . 
  i think the idea of crocodile-people is kinda lame . 
  so it says quite a lot that this race has been written in such an incredibly compelling way that i 'm willing to at least give it the time of day . 
  i 'm intrigued . 
  i still do n't think i 'd be willing to allow this in my campaigns , but i will at least concede that it 's not an utterly terrible idea . 
  and that is entirely down to the very well-written prose the author has given this . 
  they have truly given it a reason to exist . 
  ## balance/mechanics : 8.5 / 10, 
  i would rate the strength of the base race about +5.0 . 
  of particular note , is the extremely powerful *** tough hide *** ability , which gains the user +1 to ac even while wearing light or medium armour . 
  the swim speed and underwater breathing are also not insubstantial benefits . 
  greenscale i would rate +1.5 , with *** zydeco soul *** there as a nice ribbon not worth anything mechanically . 
  brownscale are a +2.0 , but on the stronger end of that , with the ability to knock an enemy prone every turn while still doing a little damage being particularly powerful at lower levels , where that damage is not insubstantial . 
  the blackscale appear very strong , with about +3.0 , but that number belies their true level of strength , which is much lower . 
  gaining darkvision and the full racial spellcasting progression is very interesting , and i feel it 's not unbalanced since the spells gained are largely flavourful , rather than mechanic . 
  darkness is by far the most powerful of the set , and even that is n't too bad . 
  overall , i think all of these are tending towards the stronger edge of acceptable races , and i 'm very concerned about that permanent +1 to ac -- it would probably be more appropriate if it only applied unarmoured -- but otherwise i think this is a perfectly acceptable race , from a mechanical standpoint . 
  # overview :, 
  i can definitely say i do n't hate this , which is the opposite of what i came into this expecting . 
  it 's a mechanically mostly sound option , it 's exceedingly well-written , and most of the formatting is fine . 
  for anyone who likes the basic idea of a crocodilian player character , i would highly recommend this race , with the one caveat regarding the ac bonus . 
  honestly i doubt anything is going to top that for me in this keynote . 
  i 've been desperately wanting this since apple first started with their current fullscreen applications system . 
   tieflings are not born of chaotic forces or demonic forces . 
  they are descendant from a pact made with devils . 
  devils are lawful evil, 
  to elaborate : the vast majority of tieflings in faer\u00fbn today are the result of a pact that a group of 13 tieflings ( known as the toril thirteen ) made with asmodeus to help him ascend to godhood . 
  thus they have a touch of devilish/infernal blood in them -- just a touch though , they 're not half-devils , that would be cambions . 
  this pact turned all the tieflings from whatever they were before ( and there was great variety , but you could generally have described them as being mostly human with maybe one or two infernal traits , like maybe a cloven hoof , or horns , that kind of thing ) into the modern depiction of the reddish skinned , horned , tailed , tiefling . 
  they are n't all descended from the toril thirteen , since even unrelated tieflings were affected by the pact . 
  other tieflings do apparently exist today , and i 'm not aware of their canonical explanation . 
  but the one i 've seen in this subreddit is basically that any tieflings whose bloodline was * first * influenced by whatever force they were influenced by * after * the toril thirteen made their pact become influenced in exactly the same way they would have before . 
  which means new tieflings * can * be abyssal influenced , or something else . 
  it 's not just the scag handwaving it , it 's a major part of forgotten realms lore , related to asmodeus 's apotheosis in the time between 3rd and 4th editions . 
   alignment dictates the general beliefs of a person, 
  alignment * describes * the general beliefs of a person . 
  ftfy, 
  honestly i prefer warcraft iii to aoe 2 . 
  i have no nostalgia for warcraft , but going back to play aoe 2 was just a pain for me . 
  it 's aged way more poorly than aom and aoe 3 i think . 
  playing wc3 for the first time earlier this year , it 's so different it makes for an interesting experience , though i 'm not sure how i 'd feel if i had the nostalgia factor too . 
  you brought up the scag . 
  that 's an fr book ... 
  i was n't correcting you , only elaborating . 
  hence `` to elaborate '' . 
  right , but the only thing i was correcting was your assertion that * in fr * it 's just this thing that 's hand waved . 
  in the more general sense , they can be whatever you want them to be , the phb does n't say anything more specific than that they are related in some way to devils , though many specific settings will probably override even that . 
  i seem to have managed to get both you and him upset at me at some point , which is rather amusing to be honest . 
  i 'm either doing something right , or something really , really wrong . 
  what was it ? 
  i 'm on a mid 2012 non-retina , and i just have no idea what i 'll do when it comes time to replace this machine . 
  i 'm probably going to try to keep this one until it just dies on me . 
  the cost to get a discrete graphics card these days is just insanely high , and i do n't know if i can justify it . 
  the change to retina only has been an intensely negative one overall , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  it does ? 
  what is it now , and what 's it going to do differently to hfs + ? 
  my biggest reason for being a ( tentative ) proponent of tex is that it does a fuck load of automation stuff for you on what feels like a more robust way than word does . 
  yes , word has inbuilt referencing features , yes it can automatically cite inline and create a bibliography . 
  yes it can manage headings and create a table of contents . 
  it can even number figures and tables automatically . 
  but something about how tex handles all this makes it feel less likely that you could accidentally take an action that would mess everything up . 
  additionally , tex gives you some really cool extra features like the ability to have comments \u00e0 la a programming language , the ability to automatically * refer to * one of those figures i mentioned earlier ( and the number will update appropriately ) , and there 's even one extension that will let you use acronyms throughout the paper , but define them for the reader the first time they appear . 
  this same feature can , i believe , be used to create a glossary instead/as well , automatically only putting in the glossary the words you actually used , so if you remove some from the paper , you do n't have to manually update the glossary . 
  it also forces you into using good formatting . 
  no more accidentally including a blank line between paragraphs , instead , it does things the proper way and you space paragraphs by defining the space before and after paragraphs . 
  that 's not to say it 's all roses . 
  tex is fucking frustrating . 
  it makes some things so insanely difficult that i want to murder whoever came up with doing things that way . 
  luckily , most of these are things you 'll do once , when you first set up a document , and never need to touch again . 
  things like setting the margins ( n.b. , unless you are required to use specific formatting -- as i was on the last report i did in tex -- just do n't mess with the default formatting . 
  use the default font , a4 paper , and the really wide margins . 
  it 's easier on you to just not change things , and it 's actually been designed that way to greatly increase readability . 
  besides , because tex is so widely used by professionals , it 's what people are used to . 
  ) , changing the font , getting the title to look how you want if it 's anything other than the basic default look , etc. 
  the biggest frustration , and there 's really do nothing you can do to avoid this , is quotes . 
  for some fucking retarded reason , whatever idiot was in charge of the design this aspect of tex decided it was a good idea to have '' ** always ** mean `` close quote marks '' .
