  if you want opening quote marks , you have to use two back ticks `` . 
  alternatively , you could define a style for quotes , so that every time you want to put something in quotes , you do something like \\ quotemarks { your text here } . 
  it 's frustrating , but whichever way you go , you will get used to it , and it 's a minor frustration compared to all the conveniences that come with it . 
  i really do recommend it . 
  dark cloud . 
  even on [ its own subreddit ] ( / r/darkcloud ) , it gets overshadowed by its `` sequel '' , dark chronicle , that apparently has nothing in common with the original . 
  also spyro . 
  gateway to glimmer was my favourite as a kid , but all three of the spyro games are amazing . 
  such a shame ** they never . 
  made . 
  another . 
  [ age of mythology ] ( / r/ageofmythology ) . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , this is hands down the best rts ever made . 
  and yet it gets way overshadowed by the painfully robotic starcraft , in which winners are determined more by their apm than their actual * strategy * ( what kind of rts is that !? 
  ) , and by age of empires 2 , which in my opinion has dated extremely poorly , with unit pathfinding being abysmal , and your units getting kited way too easily , and the annoying non-3d engine forcing you to stare in one angle , resulting in units getting caught behind trees way too easily . 
  and do n't even think about setting villagers to mine rock that 's directly behind trees . 
  no , aom is far the better game . 
  the best of the age of empires franchise by far , and my preferred rts in general . 
  catco is a media empire , qc seems to be in scientific research , so that seems unlikely . 
  oh of course . 
  the retina display itself is n't the problem . 
  but apple decided that with the switch to retina , they were going to remove the option for discrete graphics in anything under $ 3000 . 
  tabbed applications are kinda nice , but for me the highlight of the whole announcement was picture in picture videos . 
  i 've been desperately asking for this since they first implemented their new fullscreen applications . 
  that was an amazing feature that we finally have . 
  aww , poor / r/cleganebowl . 
  they just ca n't bring themselves to accept the sad truth . 
  the formatting things * are * all possible , some of them are just way more difficult than they should be . 
  the worst i 've had is trying to figure out how to get a page in landscape . 
  i ca n't remember if i actually managed to solve that one , or if i just gave up . 
  it 's insane how much work that is . 
  it should be a simple single command . 
  creating a custom look for the title page is again possible , but way more difficult and hacky than it should be . 
  i am also not a lawyer , but my understanding is that game mechanics can not be copyrighted , at least under us law . 
  i would further assume the cr calculation rules would be considered a game mechanic . 
  assuming the above two premises are true , then yes , it would be legal to have a cr calculator . 
  you have to ` fork ( ) ` the mods . 
   we 've got custom css on this subreddit . 
   it makes it display as greentext . 
   see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced syntax . 
  podcasters in general do a lot of overlap . 
  caldwell , siracusa , and snell all fairly regularly guest on [ macbreak weekly ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly ) ( part of the twit network run by leo laporte ) , one of the hosts of which has a separate podcast on relay.fm called [ material ] ( https://www.relay.fm/material ) , about google and android . 
  the other host of material , russell ivanovic , is one of the developers of [ pocket casts ] ( http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts ) , the fantastic podcatcher many of us probably use to * listen * to these podcasts . 
  ivanovic has also been a guest on [ all about android ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/all-about-android ) , another podcast on the twit network . 
  i ca n't find it at the moment , but there 's a massive graph showing a bunch of podcasts and their overlaps . 
  brady and grey have talked about it on hi before . 
  it 's * huge * , and really complicated . 
  and even then , it 's far from all-encompassing . 
  hopefully someone else can come along and link it . 
  haha not likely . 
  steve gibson is a brilliant man , but he 's also batshit insane . 
  luckily , that insanity plays to everyone 's advantage in this case , because he 's the kind of guy that 's happy to still be on xp ( i believe he 's in the process of switching to 7 soon , or maybe just recently switched ) . 
  so , when he sees microsoft 's rather deceptive practises with their windows 10 forced upgrades , it 's only natural for someone like him that he would go out and create a tool to prevent that from biting others . 
   nobody uses it for stem, 
  wait , for clarification , are we talking os x/macos here , or linux ? 
  not that it matters either way , because it 's just plain wrong either way . 
  unix is the * foundation * upon which teaching computer science or software engineering is based . 
  nobody teaches about how windows handles its file system and permissions , but how unix handles files , links , symbolic links , and mounting is standard . 
  that means macos is vastly superior to windows for students of software engineering or computer science , and accordingly , you see large numbers of students in those fields using it . 
  similarly , learning the basics of things like ` ssh ` , or working with c programmes ( with ` make ` and ` gcc ` ) is much easier when you can pop open a bash shell to work with , rather than going through some awkward gui-based system , or needing to use putty to connect to another system to do the same . 
  in other stem disciplines , most of my observations ( admittedly from afar ) have been that a ** lot ** of the software is cross-platform . 
  matlab is an obvious important bit of software , and of course everyone is going to be using either microsoft office or something tex-based , which is equally available on windows or macos . 
  i 've seen a few specialist modelling programmes that are windows-specific , but that 's about it . 
  holy double post batman !, 
  hey sorry , but this subreddit is more for text based content , rather than comics and images . 
  oh right . 
  unfortunately , mobile apps do n't display custom css . 
  logan has an airport ? 
  from my experience , he 's not far off . 
  though it 's not really a matter if `` unless the government says so '' . 
  it 's more that critical thinking and creative analysis is generally not something taught in most asian schooling systems . 
  they 're taught to memorise facts more than taught understanding of how things work . 
  in literature classes , this probably comes about as the teacher telling you how to interpret the work , rather than giving you the tools to analyse something yourself . 
  this is only my second hand knowledge , though . 
  i went to school in asia ( korea and vietnam , specifically ) from ages 10 to 18 , but at an international school . 
  i 'm gleaning this from what my friends ( some of whom had been to more traditional asian schooling systems ) and from observations from afar . 
  house of cards is not censored in china ? 
  i find that * very * interesting . 
  it 's not available on netflix in vietnam , and i had always assumed that was due to political censorship . 
  now i 'm wondering if it may be a rights issue . 
  if it * is * censorship , i wonder why vietnam views it as needing to be censored when china does not . 
  to be fair , that is a fucking fantastic episode . 
  day three , actually . 
  day one was 13/06 with / r/uncensorednews and / r/full _ news . 
  day two was 14/06 with / r/anythinggoesnews and / r/fullnews . 
  day three is today , 15/06 , with / r/neutralnews . 
  i 'm pretty sure they showed/described it as working automatically over * any * application . 
  helium does n't even come close to this functionality . 
  it basically just allows netflix and youtube to work the same way vlc already does . 
  the crucial bit of new functionality is that it allows a video to play over the top of another application . 
  that 's * huge * for people , like me , who like to watch a video while doing other things , which has to date been impossible . 
  watching the keynote , i had just assumed that vlc would be able to do this , but doing more googling now , i ca n't find a definitive answer . 
  i really hope it can , because that 's what i was super excited about . 
  if chrome can do it , too , even better . 
  because the x is reserved for huge significant changes . 
  mac os 9 to mac os x was an enormous switch from the classic mac os to a unix-based system . 
  quicktime x jumped up from quicktime 7 as was a major revamp . 
  same goes for final cut pro x and logic x , which were major redesigns over the previous versions . 
  ios 10 is just another iteration on the existing ios platform , so it 's not deserving of the x. 
  tavern brawler 's pretty weak , but there are some other ones out there that definitely compete for the honour of * weakest * feat .
