  skilled is n't great , since most characters can get plenty of proficient skills through their background and class anyway . 
  weapon master is likely even worse , since it 's giving you proficiency with weapons , but you 're * already * proficient in the weapons that jive well with your class features anyway , * regardless * of which class you choose . 
  and inspiring leader is pretty terrible too , granting a tiny amount of temp hp each short rest . 
  oh , right . 
  i was thinking that there might have been an airport in the [ city of logan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logan_city ) , which is a tiny city wedged between two proper cities that each have their own international airports . 
  i am * very * interested in having a tex option for writing up homebrew . 
  my biggest concern with it , though , is with placement of images . 
  it is absolutely crucial that it be easy to both place an image inline and have it automatically conform to the width , as well as be able to have fine control over * exactly * where it displays . 
  in the same way that homebrewery allows automatic image placement , but also lets you edit the ` < img  ` html tag and directly place things in exactly the place you want . 
  i would far prefer a latex option if it was available , but for me , it would have to be * at least * with feature parity to homebrewery , and that 's quite difficult to do . 
  if it 's even lacking in one or two small areas compared to homebrewery , i 'd probably tend to stick with that . 
  poe 's law is a great thing . 
  it 's the cyclist 's equivalent of anti-vaccers . 
  there 's been a small amount of research suggesting that wearing a helmet decreases your safety , and now a bunch of nutters think it 's actually a good idea to not wear a helmet . 
  [ the simple fact is , helmets keep you safe ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4259939.htm ) . 
  anyone who rides a bike without one is being an idiot . 
  [ owning a gun does not make you safer ] ( http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full ) . 
  in fact , you are far more likely to end up with yourself or someone you love being injured if you own a gun than any potential increase in safety due to defensive gun use . 
  and that 's without even * starting * on the dangers of multiple shooters being involved at a mass shooting , where someone with good intentions can easily make the situation worse if they are n't very lucky . 
  so yes , you should be downvoted , because you are spreading not just misinformation , but misinformation that , if taken at face value , could * directly cause harm * . 
  hi , i 've flaired this for you , and approved it this time . 
  in the future , please remember to add flair yourself , and use a more descriptive title . 
  their argument tends to come from two areas , both of which have only been tenuously demonstrated to be correct , at best . 
  they claim cyclists with helmets know they are safer , and thus ride more recklessly , and are more likely to get into accidents . 
  they claim drivers see cyclists with helmets on , and know they are safer , and thus drive more recklessly near the cyclist , and are less likely to give sufficient space , etc. 
   statistics show that the vast majority of bike accidents are caused by cyclists riding on the wrong side of the road, 
  that sounds * extremely * unlikely to me . 
  maybe in countries where bikes do n't bother paying attention to standard road rules at all , but i do n't think i have * ever * seen a rider on the wrong side of the road in australia , or ever heard about an accident occurring as a result . 
  fully agreed . 
  personally , i would not even consider allowing homebrew material if it had not been posted on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  other forums i have come across for sharing homebrew ( most notably the dungeon master 's guild and dandwiki ) do not have the some philosophy of emphasising feedback , iteration , and improvement . 
  on ua creators can expect feedback that really helps create a better end product , and as someone * looking * for content , you can expect that many creators * will * update their creations with better versions based on the feedback that they got , and thus the overall quality of content is really high . 
  but ... that 's not how demand works ... 
  universities would have no reason to price according to industry demand for jobs in the field . 
  a market-based pricing for university would result in the most expensive degrees being the ones more * students * want to study . 
  a factor completely unrelated to what you are trying to get . 
  if there * was * going to be a significant amount of differing in prices of degrees , it ca n't be done through market mechanisms . 
  it would need to be centrally set based on need , because no market mechanism would arrive at that goal . 
  this is , of course , even assuming one takes for granted your claim that pricing based on need is a good idea . 
  i very much doubt that . 
  you ca n't even use the swastika in germany for educational purposes , i doubt they 'd get away with it for comedy . 
  stupid long horse . 
  plus even in the water , you 're pretty safe from crocs if you 're south of , like , rockhampton . 
  which is basically everyone . 
   the demand is from the industry side , not the student side, 
  there is demand at both ends , and they are talking about entirely different things . 
  there is demand for jobs . 
  that 's `` how many places are there in industry to employ people with this set of skills '' . 
  then there is demand for university places . 
  that 's `` how many students want to study this degree '' . 
  the issue is that a supply/demand graph for universities will show that the price of university , if deregulated and allowed to be priced using market forces , is dependent * entirely * on the demand * for university places * . 
  there may or may not be some correlation between demand for university places and demand for jobs ( though personally i doubt it 's very strong , if there is any -- just look at how many people study the arts compared to nursing , and compare how much need there is for jobs in each ) , but the point is that if you allowed universities to price according to the market , it would be in their interest to do so based on the number of students wanting to study a degree . 
  they have zero incentive to price more for degrees that have less places available in industry . 
  your best bet to get images working nicely is to do everything in photoshop so that all you have to do once you put it on homebrewery is * place * it in the right location on the page . 
  if you want paragraphs to display correctly on reddit , you need to put a blank line between them . 
  otherwise it will display as a giant wall of text .

   `` the cup holder is broken '', 
  please tell me that 's not about what i think it 's about \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  you 've just done a complete 180 \u00b0 from your initial argument . 
   the point of university fee deregulation is that it will allow the universities to dictate pricing for different degrees, 
  this is the assumption i was arguing against . 
   the governme t [ sic ] still has oversight which is why they would be procing [ sic ] according to the oversupply of graduates , not demand from students, 
  fine , but then you 're doing something * completely * different from `` deregulating '' and `` allowing the universities to dictate pricing '' . 
  this was my point from the beginning . 
  hmm , fair enough . 
  all i know is an educational youtube channel decided they could n't portray swastikas in a series of videos about ww2 germany because they wanted their content to still be available in germany . 
  there 's technically * supposed * to be an exemption for educational purposes , but they had found that actually using it that way could be problematic and did n't always meet with approval from german officials , so they avoided using the swastika in favour of other german imagery . 
  might just have been because it 's on the internet , and the german government is infamously retarded when it comes to dealing with things on the internet . 
  i dunno exactly .

   liberal democrat, 
  why would you count those among the big three ? 
  they 're a minor party on the same level as all the ones op named . 
   probably going to be one of my 6, 
  do not just number 6 . 
  6 is the ** minimum ** you can number , but you can ** and should ** number more than that . 
  based on the ones that you 've expressed interest in , you should consider putting the greens quite highly up in your list , and labor should also be in there somewhere , but probably not until near the end . 
  really , the best voting strategy at this election will be to number ** all ** the candidates that you do n't outright disagree with . 
  for you , that seems likely to mean that you 'll * not * number the liberal party , the liberal democrats , family first , rise up australia , vote flux and online direct democracy , as well as a variety of the more right/authoritarian leaning minor parties . 
  but everyone who even slightly meets with your approval should get a number , to give you the highest chance of your vote * not * being exhausted without use . 
  this list is missing / r/brisbane . 
  a post from dndgreentext was on the front page of / r/all ? 
  which one ? 
  sonata form and `` a sonata '' are only loosely connected . 
  a sonata is a multi-movement work generally for solo instrument with piano accompaniment , or for solo piano . 
  usually the first movement of a sonata with be in sonata form . 
  typically a sonata is in three movements , with the second being a slow one , and the third being fast again , often in minuet and trio or rondo form . 
  basically , much the same format used for concertos . 
  but as with any such thing in music , these are generalities . 
  there are many , many exceptions , especially in romantic and more modern music . 
  i dunno about elsewhere , but this is very explicitly the case in aus . 
  both my bank and the official mastercard and visa websites state as such .
