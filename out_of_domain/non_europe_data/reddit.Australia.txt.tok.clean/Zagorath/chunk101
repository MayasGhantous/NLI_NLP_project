  i love how you use the word discord to describe that . 
  fits really well with the whole creation story at the beginning of the silmarillion , and all the music there . 
  whoa , whoa , whoa . 
  tolkien was quite clear that is the appropriate word , along with dwarves not dwarfs , elves not elfs , elven not elfin , and others . 
  if you think this is n't an argument i suggest you look up the word argument , as you seem to be misinformed about what it really means outside of colloquial usage . 
  have you a source for what you 've said about 7 ? 
  i 'll be more than happy to concede it if you do , but everything i 've seen points to the contrary . 
  a quick google search shows up [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14762758 ) , [ this ] ( http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/01/apple-puts-legacy-final-cut-pro-studio-back-on-sale/ ) , and [ this ] ( http://fcp.co/final-cut-pro/news/543-final-cut-pro-7-is-back-on-sale-according-to-macrumours ) ( as well as many more ) . 
  [ this search ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1c1chmy_envn322vn322&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=utf-8#hl=en&amp;rlz=1c1chmy_envn322vn322&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=final%20cut%20pro%207%20not%20actually%20on%20sale&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=a5c8a70d60340b35&amp;bpcl=37189454&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=753 ) , however , does n't show up anything relevant . 
  sure , current editors do n't have to learn a new way of doing things if they do n't want to , and can happily continue using fcp 7 as well as avid or adobe 's options . 
  that does n't mean this new way of doing things is inherently bad , though . 
  you have every right to dislike it and not use it yourself , but you have * no * right to say it is unprofessional and unusable software . 
  that simply is n't the case . 
  as time goes on more and more editors who will have had their very first editing experiences in imovie , before moving up to fcp x will be used to the slightly different way of doing things in that programme and be able to use it far more efficiently than they ever could in a more `` traditional '' piece of software . 
  take a look at the comments in [ this article ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/06/final-cut-pro-x-update ) . 
  particularly appropriate , i think , are robertdee 's and david burckhard 's, 
  i had a lot of trouble finding this , so i thought i 'd share it to hopefully make it easier for others . 
  can someone link to all the top posts referenced in this ? 
  i only got the mariokart and ned ones ... 
  but then it wo n't be oc anymore , unfortunately . 
   in the us the international sign, 
  but seriously , the point is many people feel this has n't varied over to australia , so that does n't work . 
  yeah , i was nitpicking . 
  but myron point still works . 
  but do you not feel that a more carefully constructed prison system could fix this ? 
  i 'm somewhat surprised not to so more lotr : online in here . 
  then again , when i tried downloading it in steam , after it was finished i clicked on the button to create an account , it opened in internet explorer ( yes , iexplore.exe , even though chrome is set as my default browser ) and then refused to actually accept my submission . 
  i suspect many others have probably had similarly bad experiences , so maybe that explains the lack of mentioning it . 
  i did a one-day marathon of the entire extended editions last thursday with my little sister . 
  i think they 'll show something like that , but that wo n't be the last scene . 
  i really like op 's idea , so i hope that 's how it happens . 
  maybe they found some way to exclude that , like not counting flash games , or not counting free games . 
  even then i do n't think 8 hours is the mean ( or median , for that matter ) time played . 
  surely too many people have other things to do ... 
  i think this could be right . 
  i 've done both of these before . 
  opened up the game , then took some time to watch a movie on my other computer with the game just sitting the in the menu , or open the game then alt-tab out to do something else and forget about it . 
  for me the other one was with a store in flyff . 
  nothing about having a place for a store , i just left the store open overnight so lots of people would have the chance to buy from it . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  i 'll definitely take a look at it . 
  btw , ( off-topic ) i use click with two fingers . 
  i hate secondary click being bottom right corner , the area 's too small to make it easy to use , but still is annoying sometimes when trying to primary click . 
  edit : i 've had chrome for a very long time , and my `` versions '' only has the latest two . 
  are you sure this problem is n't one-off ( or at least a rare issue ) ? 
  if you 're on a mac , yes , it 's super easy . 
  one of the keyboard options is called dvorak-qwerty ( with a command symbol inserted after the qwerty ) . 
  on windows , sorry , you 're out of luck . 
  no native way of doing this , but perhaps someone may know a third party tool for it . 
  personally i 've gotten used to doing shortcuts in the dvorak layout , and i really easily and naturally switch between the two when switching from mac to windows ( both of which i use regularly ) . 
  indeed he does . 
  was a problem for me , that 's my age . 
  i went with 18-24 because it makes more sense that 18 would be grouped that way , being the age of majority . 
  and i noticed that problem with two extremes as well . 
  was a bit odd , so i simply assumed never was truly never or * extremely * rarely , and often was anything more than that . 
  i do n't think i 've ever used `` other '' fields before . 
  now i have twice . 
  good point . 
  that probably is n't what they 've done , but i was just suggesting it as a possibility . 
  well , no they do n't . 
  they do n't * need * to do anything . 
  i imagine they had a point they wanted to prove , so they 've engineered their sample so that it fits that point . 
  it does n't show scientific integrity , but this is a `` popular '' magazine . 
  but perhaps they wanted average gaming sessions `` of hardcore gamers '' . 
  in that case it makes sense to exclude casual games and not mmos . 
  in that case what they 've done probably makes a lot more sense . 
  i still think they 've messed with the numbers in an unscientific way , though ... 
  yep , that 's the one . 
  thanks for the picture . 
  haha awesome !, 
  i 'll have to give that a try on my windows machines . 
  cheers !, 
  i 've tried youtube with html5 enabled . 
  i do n't know what format they used , but it worked nowhere near as well as it does with flash . 
  kinda like mlia was originally meant to be . 
  i am exactly the same . 
  i ca n't stand it . 
  i 'm a musician and i 've literally never heard of someone saying met for metronome before . 
  if they did it would piss me off to no end . 
  yes, 
  edit : the rules for this calculator should be the same as for maths papers 2 and 3 : the same calculators , they must have their memory reset before entering the exam room , no calculator cases , etc. 
  bonus tip edit : i found it really useful to , in the time waiting for the exam to start , enter values i 'm going to need to use a lot , like g , q , etc. 
  into the memory of the calculator to make it easier to use in calculations . 
  that said , i had been using g and q througout the course anyway , so i was used to it . 
  if you 're not used to it it might not be a good idea to try and learn it too close to the exams . 
  when people say `` could care less '' when they mean `` could n't care less '' . 
  you just fucking said the opposite of what you wanted to say you idiot . 
  off-topic : thank you for saying `` i couldnt care less '' ( even if you forgot the apostrophe ) . 
  my answer to op 's question is when people say `` could care less '' . 
  yes . 
  do they not realise that they 're saying the opposite of what they mean ? 
  it 's like they do n't listen to the words coming out of their own mouth and think about what those words mean ... 
  people saying could care less bugs me to no end . 
  but since you mentioned their/they 're / there , i 'll add people misusing apostrophes . 
  ( or , as they would say , apostrophe 's . 
  misusing the apostrophe 's what , may i ask ? ), 
  more importantly , he does n't like * other people * being able to see when they 're driving , either . 
  every time i mention `` could n't care less '' i see someone say something to this effect , but quite frankly i do n't see how it makes sense . 
  18 is a senior in college ? 
  damn ... where i am it 's either the first year of university or the last year of secondary school .
