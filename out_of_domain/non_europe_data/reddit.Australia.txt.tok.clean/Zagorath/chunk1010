  what 's the penultimate one ? 
  it 's showing for me as a box . 
  ~ ~ actually on that note , what 's the first one ? 
  it looks to me like a crescent moon with a flower next to it . ~ ~, 
  edit : disregard that last part . 
  the grey background of my reddit app made the rest of the bomb invisible so all i could see were the white sheen and the lit fuse . 
  clicking on the comment made it have more of a blue background so i can see the whole thing . 
  i 'm guessing a typed and printed letter would be * almost * as good as handwritten ? 
  because my handwriting is near illegible . 
  for reference , did you write this to your federal mp or your state mp ( are they even called mps at the state level ? 
  i 'm not sure ... ) ? 
  also , i see you favour ieee citations . 
  nice . 
  yeah i 'm with you . 
  i find the ( author , year ) for inline citations that most other systems use incredibly clumsy compared to just a simple number . 
  i 've never been told a particular format to use , but studying software engineering , ieee just made sense , and in glad , because i really like it as a format . 
   you seem to be misunderstanding my argument , i agree stories should have themes and messages but i dislike over analysis of story elements such that the form of a character/plot/or the author 's expressed motive for the piece becomes entirely irrelevant to the discussion . 
  i think you may have been missing the entire point of literary analysis . 
  the author 's motive can be interesting to discuss , but as far as coming up with your critical interpretation of the work , it is , essentially , irrelevant . 
  what you take when you read or watch something is n't going to be impacted by the author 's intent , unless you knew the intent going into it somehow . 
  there 's a concept in literary analysis called `` le mort de l'auteur '' , and it is absolutely * fundamental * to how analysing a text works . 
  when you read something , you are bringing in all of your own prior experiences in life , everything else you 've read , your personality , etc. 
  and that affects how you interpret something . 
  you might miss something the author thought was the whole point . 
  or you might add in entirely new meaning . 
  and that 's totally fine , because the whole * point * of criticism is that you 're talking about what the work means to * you * . 
  it can be interesting to also talk about what the author intended and discuss how they achieved it . 
  or to mention the experiences that the * author * brought in to the work . 
  for example discussing ariel dorfman 's experience of the pinochet regime , or george orwell with the spanish civil war . 
  but that 's sort of a tangential discussion . 
  a very useful one in many cases because knowing that can influence what you bring to the work and help paint a fuller picture , but it is n't essential and if your interpretation of something differs , even if you * are * familiar with the author 's intent , that 's a completely and equally acceptable position to hold . 
  have they already confirmed os x support ? 
  music is one that most probably would n't expect . 
  5s and 6s are fairly easy , but 7 is very hard . 
  yeah , they may not do it much , but when they * do * talk , ** bam ** they pack a punch . 
  fwiw , today is father 's day in a vast majority of the world , and especially reddit 's demographics , not just the us . 
  us , uk , france , canada , and the netherlands , among many others . 
  probably the most substantial countries to reddit that * do n't * celebrate it today are australia and new zealand . 
  glad you 've removed this anyway though , for the other bullet points you gave . 
  as a side note , mother 's day is much the same , though in that case anz are on board with the majority , and the uk is separate . 
  real lpt , [ the heimlich maneuver is n't recommended for people ] ( https://www.accreditedfirstaid.com.au/2014/08/22/the-heimlich-manouevre-why-dont-we-use-it/ ) as it has not been sufficiently proven to work , and the risks associated may even be worse than the potential positives . 
  i do n't know about animals , but i 'd be hesitant to try it . 
  back blows are great , though . 
   thats 1am for those in gmt + dst, 
  i 'm confused . 
  is it 0100 utc or 0000 utc ? 
  that is , when you say 1am `` in gmt + dst '' , is that what 1am for those under bst , or is it 1am gmt , plus british people need to add an hour because of wibbly wobbly time nonsense ? 
  le mort de l'auteur is n't some theory that you can just reject . 
  it 's how the entirety of literary analysis works . 
  if you somehow did decide you want to reject it , you 're essentially saying `` fuck you , reader of this book , your opinions do n't matter because i , the author , said this is what it 's about . '', 
  you ca n't just do that . 
  if the author intends something , it will generally be evident in the text itself . 
  and if it is n't , so what ? 
  any audience will always bring its own experiences to a text , and nobody can dictate how they interpret it . 
  people just do n't work that way . 
    if the author intends something , it will generally be evident in the text itself . 
   and does n't death of an author say this is irrelevant ? 
  the author 's intentions are irrelevant and how he expresses them are equally irrelevant . 
  what ? 
  where would you even get that ? 
  la mort de l'auteur just says that you regard a text for what is in the text . 
  common sense . 
  the author 's * intentions * are n't relevant per se , but how they express them * are * . 
  if you read a text and find yourself reaching the same conclusions that the author intended , that just means the author did a really good job of conveying those intentions . 
  which is equally as valid as if you reached different conclusions . 
  it 's really not a complicated concept , and there 's really not much room for controversy . 
  i honestly ca n't begin to understand what your issue is with it . 
  the `` core '' is now worth 7 points . 
  tok/ee matrix is 5 points , cas is worth 2 . 
  it would make the things that are supposed to be the `` core '' of the ib go from being things everyone reluctantly does just well enough to pass , into something that 's actually worth putting some serious effort into . 
  i hate the fact that there were students in my year who barely did any cas , and only put up reflections after constant badgering by the cas coordinator , and students like myself who were involved in heaps of activities are treated exactly the same by ib . 
  i would make it so that those former group would still pass , but get 0 points . 
  1 point for doing extra stuff , and 1 point for particularly good reflections . 
  and making tok/ee worth more is pretty much a no brainer , considering how much work we have to put into them . 
  combined , these three aspects deserve to be treated equally to an sl subject , i think . 
  here 's what i put in the general feedback section , regarding that :, 
   the note in the survey regarding the dungeon master 's guild was extremely disappointing . 
   we 've been sorely missing the unearthed arcana articles every month , and the dmg reviews feel extremely lacking . 
  more high quality content from you guys is what we 're after . 
   it does n't help that , frankly , the dungeon master 's guild is not a good forum for what it does . 
  to make good homebrew , it is ** essential ** that a product go through a process of creation , feedback/criticism/commentary , and iteration/revision . 
  the dm 's guild simply does not encourage that in any way . 
  compare to , for example , the / r/unearthedarcana subreddit , which has an extremely strong culture of improving content over time as a result of feedback from other members of the community . 
  personally , i would never allow homebrew material that had not gone through a public feedback process \u00e0 la / r/unearthedarcana , and i do not think that wizards should encourage otherwise . 
  either dm 's guild should be majorly revamped to encourage a similar iteration process and to put community feedback front and centre , or the dm 's guild should be scraped entirely in favour of putting public support in an existing forum that already provides that culture . 
   where if you 're at a disadvantge somehow a miss is now better for you than if you were fighting normally, 
  no it 's not , and it should never be . 
  the disadvantage case , in any good design -- including the one in the fell handed feat -- does not do * anything * that could n't be achieved in greater effect with a normal success . 
  all it does is do a little bit of damage , if the normal attack would just deal damage . 
  maybe if the normal attack would have had some effect aside from damage , some lesser version of that effect could be applied . 
  but never , ** never ** a special effect on a near miss with disadvantage that could not have been achieved with a normal hit . 
  the link is already in the article ... 
  i agree with / u/hazezero regarding sea legs . 
  the current wording just does n't feel like it fully understands how swim speeds and climb speeds work in 5e . 
  captain at the helm has an editing error : `` the inspired creature gains ** your ** double your charisma modifier '' . 
  on another note , i wonder why double cha . 
  why not the more conventional cha + rogue levels , or something like that ? 
  flavour-wise , my biggest problem is that it forces you down what seems to me far too strict a path . 
  you * have * to become the captain of a ship , and then you * have * to become one of the most feared of all pirates . 
  why can a corsair not be someone else from a ship who 's just really good at what he does ?
