  i 'm not a fan of the description being quite as specific as this was . 
  i also agree with / u/pixie1001 regarding the flavour of specific abilities . 
  [ here you go ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 4o4btt/comic _ strips_from_our_ongoing_campaign_5e / ) . 
  it was removed because this subreddit is not for comics , generally . 
  that would be why you had trouble finding it . 
  oh shit sounds like i only just got home in time :\\, 
  my bus from the northside to the city could n't stop at king george on account of the weather , so got dropped off at the cultural centre and had to walk ( well , run ) through the rain back to king george for a connecting service ... that was ... fun . 
  i did some googling . 
   the word togs is an abbreviation of the sixteenth-century criminal slang [ thieve 's cant ] togeman , meaning ` coat ' . 
  togeman itself comes from the roman ` toga ' , which comes from the latin tegere ` to cover ' . 
  the first citation for togs in the oed dates from 1708 , when it was still considered a part of the flash language of the criminal underworld . 
  later in the eighteenth century togs was used as slang or humorously for clothes -- the oed has a 1779 citation for this sense . 
  so by the time the first fleet left portsmouth bound for botany bay there were many aboard who knew this word . 
  but it is not until 1918 that we have our first written evidence of togs used in a swimming context . 
  the citation comes from the kia-ora coo-ee , which was the official magazine of the australian and new zealand armed forces : ` some of the queenslanders are revelling in the opportunity of getting out in this hot weather in their bathing togs ! ', 
  by 1930 in australian english togs had become synonymous with ` swimming costume ' and had lost the general meaning of ` clothes ' [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://andc.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/speedos.html ) . 
  brb , gon na go do that , just to spite you . 
  right weather for it , too , at the moment ... 
  no you would n't . 
  tok and the ee would remain the same . 
  the score is just updated to better reflect the importance of them in ib 's philosophy and the amount of time spent on them . 
  anti-nuclear was a dumb position to hold two decades ago . 
  these days , not so much . 
  we 're at the point now where it would actually be cheaper to put more effort into renewable energy sources than it would to cultivate a nuclear industry from scratch . 
  do n't feed the trolls , mate . 
  my suspicion is that if someone said `` hitler was a nazi '' in response to a post detailing all of the policies put in place prior to ww2 , the reasons for them at the time , and their effects on germany , then yes , that would be unnecessarily dismissive . 
  they 're open saturday and sunday, 
  the point of the person you responded to was to enable proper test conditions . 
  it 's already relatively simple to cheat on the test as it 's done today , online would be them saying `` yep , cheating is completely okay with this , we 're really just a rubber stamp anyway '' . 
  you seem to have missed the sarcasm in the above comment ... 
  oh and while i 'm at it , the expression is `` the * bearer * of bad news '' . 
  note that even if you 're only here for a short term , you ** really ** should get a go card . 
  it 'll keep the cost down for you ( the journey planner shows you the cost for both paper tickets and go cards ) , but it 's also extremely convenient and keeps the time taken down . 
  if that airport to cleveland ( and back ? ), 
  is the only journey you 'll be taking , then it 's probably not worth it . 
  but if you use it any more than that it will be . 
  i finished it , but holy fuck is it a boring game . 
  i really enjoyed the story , which is why i forced myself through it , but the games combat mechanics are some of the most dull and monotonous of any game i 've played . 
  i never finished awakening , the major expansion to origins . 
  i think your best bet is tab . 
  tab technically just cycles through all the interactive elements on a page ( links , forms , etc. 
  ) , but a well-made page will have their important elements first in that tab list , so you should only need to press it once or twice . 
  i do n't know about other states , but in queensland ib is ** very ** highly valued . 
  i only scored 37 , but that was the equivalent of an op1 , the highest score you can get . 
  with only 37 , i could have gotten in to literally any course i wanted except perhaps medicine ( and specific course prerequisites ) . 
  if other states are less favourable , you really ca n't blame the ibo for that . 
  conversion between ib scores and national scores is something the uni system does . 
  tok and ee would be combined worth 5 points . 
  that 's less than a subject . 
  it 's only when you add in cas ( the addition of which certainly brings them into line with , if not ahead of , sl subjects ) that they become equal . 
  i would change that to `` make ** any ** one group not mandatory '' . 
  currently , everyone is required to do two languages . 
  everyone has to do a social science and a physical science . 
  and everyone has to do maths . 
  but the arts ? 
  yeah , i guess you can do one of those if you want . 
  change it so that every student has to do 5 of the 6 groups , but they can choose which one they skip . 
  it would keep the well-roundedness which is what makes ib the best schooling system in the world . 
  but it would also allow students a little more flexibility if there 's a particular subject area they really do n't like , and would open up more possible combinations , like doing computer science , physics , and music , or music and theatre ( both of which are impossible currently , since doing an art means giving up a second from any other group , and 2 arts is just impossible ) . 
  yeah , it is . 
  unfortunately , it was * really * highly upvoted before we even noticed it , and by that time it would have done more harm than good to remove it . 
  i guess there 's at least a claim high up in the thread that it was * based * on a post on this subreddit , though that has gone unsubstantiated so far . 
  ah that 's interesting . 
  perhaps a similar prerequisite could be added to this ? 
  it would n't be the first subclass to have a prerequisite ( spellsingers and battleragers have , at least in the realms , a racial requirement ) . 
  so , another user informed me that in the original , there was a prerequisite that one had to be a captain of a ship already , before taking the prc . 
  i think making that a requirement here would probably * really * help make the progression feel more natural rather than forced . 
  it would n't be the first subclass to have a prerequisite ( spellsingers and battleragers have , at least in the realms , a racial requirement ) . 
  i 've never heard that before in my life . 
  i just googled both [ `` finger buns '' ] ( http://www.taste.com.au/images/recipes/agt/2004/11/finger-buns-2904_l.jpeg ) and [ `` coffee rolls '' ] ( http://christinesfarmhouse.com/wp-content/gallery/swiss-rolls/b018--coffee%20swiss%20roll.jpg ) . 
  the images i got matched up pretty much with what i expected , which is that the two are not the same thing at all . 
  which was it you wanted ? 
   that sounds like a term from victorian, 
  to be fair , look at where else the term is used , according to the map . 
   horses are part of ... pet food, 
  wait what ? 
  no but seriously , do n't do that . 
  doing stuff to annoy election workers is like annoying your waiter at a restaurant . 
  they play no part in deciding the rules for how elections work or in the actual policies that politicians put forward . 
  in fact , being a dick to election workers is even * worse * than with your waiter , since at least it 's * possible * for a waiter to get your order wrong or provide bad service . 
  the guy at the polling station is just there to cross your name out of a book and give you two bits of paper . 
   port, 
  okay come on . 
  you 've got to be kidding about that one , right ? 
  or maybe it just has some other meaning here that i 'm not aware of , and * that 's * the one that non-queenslanders are also not aware of ? 
  i imagine that would depend upon the nature in which they pointed it out . 
  if all they said was `` yeah but hitler was a nazi '' , then yes , that 's still dismissive . 
  if they were more productive about it , then it would be worthwhile . 
  hitler is a special case , though , because everyone * already knows * he was a nazi . 
  so it has a higher bar to be worthwhile mentioning than it would with someone who is n't known to have whatever trait someone is saying they have . 
  ah right , that last one is n't one i 've heard before . 
  but that 's very interesting . 
  it seems like it would have derived from the occupation of `` porter '' , which comes from old french for `` to carry '' . 
  oh , right . 
  in the senate it should n't matter , since they use a software system to calculate the result . 
  and in all honesty it probably does n't matter in the reps either , since they 'll generally have a result quickly enough anyway due to the order things get eliminated . 
   how i say chance , plant , advance, 
  how do they say those ? 
  chaahhnce , like some sort of faux-posh person ? 
  true enough , but then you 're still left with the problem of the flavour making no sense .
