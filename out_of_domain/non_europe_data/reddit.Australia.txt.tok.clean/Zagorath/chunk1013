  it had never been a word i 'd have even thought people * would n't * use . 
  duvet still sounds to me like you 're trying to be posh . 
  can you put that phrase in a sentence ? 
  i do n't recognise it on its own , but i 'm wondering if i would in context . 
  googling suggests veal german contains red wine powder , but otherwise the two are the same . 
  as a side note , googling also taught me that apparently [ some people ( not many ) want it banned ] ( https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-ban-devon-worldwide ) , although they do n't actually say why ... 
  yeah , i 'm not familiar with that one . 
  do you know where it comes from ? 
  when you say op , do you mean me , or the guy that linked the thread in / r/australia that i linked to ? 
  because i 'm from queensland , and was just surprised to learn from the map and from reading comments in that thread , that apparently it 's not a term used elsewhere . 
  someone mentioned that victoria * used * to use togs a lot , but that it is n't common anymore . 
  that could be where you and joeblow get it from . 
  but seriously , that is vote manipulation and it is ** seriously ** against reddit 's rules . 
  if you want the bot to be able to post in your subreddit without the 15 minute or whatever delay between submissions , just add it to the approved submitter list . 
  it looks to me like a rather clumsy attempt at referencing `` because ` $ { current_year } ` is the year of linux on desktop '' , which is something linux fans have been saying every year for decades . 
  the second chair violinist there trying to cushion the fall with his foot . 
  even if he 'd got it there in time i doubt it would 've helped , but the attempt was nice . 
  they do n't have cheerios in nsw or vic ? 
  and surely th 's arvo * has * to be an australia-wide thing , right . . ? 
  not sure what doubling or straz are . 
  and gods damned peanut paste . 
  growing up i was always told that was what americans called it , so i thought it was like `` zee '' or `` color '' . 
  i was surprised when i found out it was just us , and then even more surprised when i found out that it 's not even all australians , but just queenslanders . 
  not that i care , that stuff is foul whatever you call it . 
  a rose by any other name , as it were . 
  edit : and lamington is ** definitely ** a country-wide thing . 
  they originated here ( according to wikipedia , anyway ) , but i refuse to believe that the term is n't used elsewhere . 
  punches in films and television are weaker than in real life . 
  it 's a universal law . 
  it is known . 
  i also do n't agree with pork ( and reading their reply to your comment , i disagree with them * even more * than after the first one ) , but i 'll also pretend i do for a moment . 
  why am i watching this show ? 
  if i 'm a fan of the big generic hollywood blockbuster , i 'm probably not watching the sixth season of a show that is very much not that . 
  i 'm reminded of something author brandon sanderson said about writing fantasy . 
  if you 're going to go against conventions , you need to do it early . 
  because readers who like things that follow conventions will read through the whole book , get to the twist , and by disappointed/off-put by it . 
  your book will get bad reviews . 
  on the other hand , readers who enjoy convention-defying stories will read a few chapters before going `` this is dull , generic , trite '' , and putting the book down . 
  they 'll never get to the bit they should have enjoyed . 
   the only real difference at distance would be rate of fire and time to target . 
  speaking of which , did anyone else think it was kinda dumb that they had the penultimate arrow drop and miss rickon , and then the last one came and hit him only moments later ? 
  all the other arrows clearly took ages to arrive , and then this last one seemed near instantaneous . 
  he still had , like , 20 good men . 
  are people criticising the * show * for that , or simply claiming that that would have been something that , if this were real life , would have kept rickon alive ? 
  because i 'm in the latter camp . 
  it * would * have , and had he been thinking straight , he * should * have done that . 
  but for the narrative , he needed to die , and i guess there 's a reasonable amount of logical explanation for why he would n't have thought to run zig-zags . 
  she sent the raven like two episodes ago . 
  they were late because they had to travel all the way from the neck . 
   they kept wanting me to say `` pool '' and `` school '' a lot too, 
   would not be hard to create an ethereum client that only exposed the functions needed to vote, 
  that would still require people to have a computer , and have an internet connection . 
  and be able to install software on that system . 
  and ideally , the * best * method of ensuring both anonymity and no double-votes that i 'm aware of would also require that users store a small amount of data * securely * between registering to vote and actually voting . 
  it 's theoretically possible to come up with a great solution to online voting , but unfortunately up there with anonymity and no double-voting , in important traits of a voting system , is ensuring * no one * is disenfranchised . 
  even mild technical hurdles are , unfortunately , unacceptable , if there is no way for someone with zero technical capability to get around it . 
  fantastic episode . 
  only criticism i have that i have n't seen elsewhere , is that i thought theon and yara arriving was a bit awkward . 
  it felt like it needed an establishing shot . 
  like 6 seconds of them on the boats sailing up towards meereen , and * then * cut to the shot we got . 
  also not criticism per se , but the opening confused me . 
  it showed braavos and the wall , and probably other places too , that this episode never went to . 
  that 's unusual .

  yeah i agree completely . 
  it * really * would have benefitted from an establishing shot of yara and theon in their ships arriving at meereen . 
   lord paramountcies, 
  the term is lords paramount , much like you do n't have `` attorney generals '' , but `` attorneys general '' . 
  you make the noun plural , not the accompanying adjective . 
  [ this should help ] ( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/lord_paramount_of_the_trident ) . 
  and how , pray tell , does it not ? 
   i think that the resolution here would involve the electoral commission handing out private keys . 
  which sounds sucky and centralised but so is the government . 
  yeah , this is a * big * no no . 
  the answer involves the users ' app generating a random token , and having that token blindly signed by the aec 's servers when they register to vote ( has to be once * per election * ) . 
  then when voting , they send an unblinded version of that token along with their vote . 
  the issue is they then have to store that token between registration and actually voting . 
  the app could * probably * handle it , but it makes it necessary to actually * own * a computer , you ca n't just use a public library one , for example . 
  as a side note , there are some decent ways of working around this issue even today , by using a hybrid system where people can choose either to vote at home or on publicly-provided computers that are * also * running an ethereum app , but this app does n't require the token . 
  so you still get most of the benefits of a dapp . 
  it 's just a little more convoluted . 
  oh fair enough . 
  i must have missed that . 
  admittedly , i ( like most people , probably ) have n't paid super-close attention to the opening in a long time .
