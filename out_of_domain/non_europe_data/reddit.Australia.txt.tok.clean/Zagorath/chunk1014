  hahaha . 
  i 've already solved most of them from a theoretical standpoint . 
  at least all the problems that i can think of ( i 'm sure someone heavily involved in the electoral process could come up with a flaw that i have n't thought of yet ) . 
  did some work on an ethereum-based voting dapp for a 4th year university course last semester . 
  it 's just not always worth typing it all out in a reddit comment , so i just explain the basics , then if someone raises an issue about a more specific part of it , i 'll explain that bit . 
  for me , afternoon tea has always been something that was had * after * school . 
  still vehemently against the notion that anyone not a member of the party would be allowed access to private party conversations . 
  turnout is going to continue to be poor as long as the system is poorly designed . 
  i do n't visit nearly as frequently as i used to because of some highly negative changes that have been made , not the least of which is requiring head mod access to party rooms . 
  it 's just not as fun as it once was . 
  and as a result of not visiting frequently , i did n't even see that there was a vote going on . 
   no falling damage, 
  not if they * jump * , but if they 're pushed off an edge you can easily say that they are n't able to gather control in time . 
  how many times do you see characters in comics that can fly , but still manage to get thrown into buildings and what not ? 
  i 'm guessing it originally said / ufreddy926 ? 
  if so , i 'm fairly sure that editing in a username mention does n't send a notification . 
  while we 're at it , the plural is `` coups de gr\u00e2ce '' , and is pronounced `` coop de grass '' . 
  to me , if the target of the attack is roughly humanoid or is a simple familiar animal , and is medium sized or smaller , i say un coup de gr\u00e2ce outside of combat is an automatic kill . 
  if you can sneak up on someone unconscious or asleep , and are n't trying to do things quickly and keep yourself from being attacked by others at the same time , then slitting their throat is an easy auto-success . 
  no rolls . 
  in combat , they get advantage on the attack , and if they hit it automatically crits . 
  that 's not special rules , that 's using the conditions from the phb . 
  `` incapacitated '' , i think . 
  if the creature is not anything like a humanoid or animal , or the animal is too large , then i would apply the same rules out of combat as in combat . 
  same goes if they have any special protection like magic . 
  the general form of negating something in french is `` ne verb pas '' . 
  one of the best things 4e did , imo , is reducing mechanics for non-combat stuff , allowing dms to rule according to what makes sense . 
  so glad 5e brought forward the same philosophy . 
  the problem is that the assertion made by the top level comment in this chain is that it unravels in an example like the one given by op . 
  but it is n't only in such an extreme case that things unravel . 
  op 's extreme case just demonstrates very clearly how poor of an idea it is to apply those rules to any case that one might describe as un coup de gr\u00e2ce . 
  really , * any * sleeping humanoid upon which the character can sneak up and carefully attack , should be given an auto-kill . 
  in combat , the mechanics make sense because you 're in a rush and you 're simultaneously keeping yourself protected from attacks by others . 
  out of combat that does n't apply , and the fact that you can take your time and be careful should enable an automatic kill if you can get to the point where you have your knife at his throat without him waking up and reacting . 
   it does not trump a parent 's choice, 
  quite simply , the child 's benefit should outweigh the desires of the parent . 
  choosing not to vaccinate is borderline negligence , and we already take children away from parents who are negligent . 
  putting a grey area in there where smaller but still very important decisions are taken away from the parent for less severe bad parenting is no huge deal . 
   there are situations where religion is also at play , and medical intervention is prohibited by faith, 
  too bad . 
  exemptions to reasonable behaviour should not be allowed based on which sky fairy someone chooses to believe in . 
  psst , you 're arguing with an anarcho capitalist . 
  there is ** no ** seeing reason with them . 
  as far as they 're concerned , ** anything ** a government does is immoral . 
  you have to trust that things you purchase with bitcoin will be delivered as you said , because there 's no one that can reverse the transaction if you get a faulty product and they refuse to refund . 
  it 's a relatively rare situation , admittedly , but it 's a super important one . 
  [ you may find it worthwhile to try this ] ( https://www.grc.com/health/sleep/healthy_sleep_formula.htm ) . 
  yes , i know , the website looks sketchy as all fuck , but that 's just because its creator is insanely old-fashioned . 
  if you 've heard about the kerfuffle with windows trying to force users to upgrade to windows 10 , you may have also heard of a tool called never 10 , which is used to prevent that upgrade from happening . 
  it 's from this same guy . 
  he runs a weekly security podcast ( and a really good one !, 
  ) , and on a few episodes recently he 's talked about the process and how well it works for him and some listeners . 
  he 's also not making any money from this , something he 's doing very deliberately to attempt to * not * look like some sketchy snake-oil ( or worse ) salesman . 
  i ca n't verify it myself : i 've never tried it , and personally i would be very hesitant to try it , because i do n't like taking medication of any sort when i can avoid it : i do n't even take vitamins or supplements . 
  but from what he 's said , it apparently * should * be completely safe and without side effects , and it 's all over-the-counter stuff : supplements , mostly . 
  it may be worth consulting a doctor to double check that it 's safe , especially if you 're someone like me who is hesitant to try medicines , and * especially * especially if you already take anything regularly . 
  as i said , i 've never used it , and i never * would * use something like this . 
  but the recommendation * has * come from someone that i generally trust , and what i 've heard of it is that it * does * work like magic . 
  if you 're in such dire need of something to help you sleep , this may do the trick . 
  aye , i 've already seen it ( and left comments ! ) . 
  thanks so much for doing these !, 
  oh interesting . 
  i was not aware that was a term . 
  had you asked me what the office a lord paramount holds was , i probably would have said a paramounty , or paramouncy . 
  til . 
  thanks . 
  beauty is exactly * why * tabs are better . 
  a single tab represents a single level of logical indentation . 
  that 's a beautiful , elegant solution , like refactoring your code to pull out something that logically should be its own function into its own function , rather than bluntly throwing it the middle of another one . 
  edit : i just thought of an even better analogy . 
  it 's like pressing the `` heading '' button in word and adjusting the space below paragraphs , or \\ section in latex , rather than just manually increasing the font size and entering blank lines . 
  sure , it accomplishes the same basic task , but one is far more beautiful . 
  pressing space a bunch of times ( or having the editor do it for you ) is * exactly * like pressing enter a bunch of times to get the right amount of whitespace above your next line . 
  philosophically , i prefer tabs for the exact same reason as you stated . 
  that 's literally their purpose . 
  levels of tabbing indicate the amount of logical indentation in the code . 
  but i use spaces regardless because from what i can tell , basically every official channel does . 
  it 's pep , it 's the style recommended by google in java , it 's what my university recommends/requires on the occasions they demand a particular style . 
  from my perspective , the argument is done . 
  the wrong side won it , but it 's over , except for internet debates of the same callibre as vim vs emacs or ghif vs jif . 
  you know , i 've been avoiding watching the latest season of that . 
  i thought i 'd be okay waiting for it be over so i could binge watch it . 
  `` it 's not game of thrones , after all , there 's nothing in the way of spoilers that could be a problem '' , i said . 
  i do n't think i can count the number of times i 've been proven wrong about that ... 
  the way you wrote it looked pretty much spot-on for the pronunciation . 
  just needed to swap the `` pa '' and the `` parl '' . 
  and the s in fran\u00e7ais is silent , i guess . 
  je ne parl pa fransai , more or less . 
  parl rhymes with carl . 
  no they are n't . 
  edit , 
  i watched that not too long ago . 
  it was * okay * , but felt a bit lacking . 
  trying to tell a full character arc in such a short space of time is just not doable . 
  asajj ventress had great potential , and of course anakin 's portrayal was great , but the relatively short run time really did n't help . 
  i never truly felt like asajj , in particular , had been developed on-screen well enough to properly care for her as a character , and her death was a lot less impactful than it could have been . 
  grievous , too , did n't really do it for me , for much the same reason . 
  honestly i had no idea what you were talking about when you said pluto pup . 
  i know what a dagwood dog is , though . 
  fancy seeing you here .
