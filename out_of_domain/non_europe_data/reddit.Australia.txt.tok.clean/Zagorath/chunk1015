  the issue is that this is n't about `` the rights of people '' . 
  it 's about the fact that a parent should n't have the right to potentially cause harm to their child who does n't know better . 
  it does n't matter their reason for doing so . 
  teaming up with ahsoka ? 
  i do n't recall that . 
  as far as i can remember , the last we saw her was when anakin fought her and she fell into a giant chasm , presumably dead . 
  the evidence ( which i believe i linked to in my former comment -- if i did n't , let me know and i 'll find it next time in on a computer rather than mobile ) seems to say that going after renewables will be cheaper for australia than nuclear would . 
  improvements in the tech are nice and all , but it will still be more expensive . 
  muphry 's law in action . 
  i think the question needs to be asked : what 's different now to before the switch ? 
  why did we have at least two fairly successful speakers in the old system , and none in the new ? 
  is there anything that can be done to get back to what we used to have ? 
  my view is that it should be non-negotiable that the speaker comes from elected representatives , but there is worthwhile debate to be had on whether or not they can vote . 
  i prefer a non-voting speaker , because my view is that without strong reasons otherwise , staying closer to rl is better . 
  it 's what makes our system better than the other model governments out there which dumb it down for the masses . 
  i mean ... if the us is still recommending dangerous procedures be performed by inexperienced members of the public , is that really something we here should endorse ? 
  or should we endorse the more intelligent response ? 
  netflix ? 
  are you talking about star wars : clone wars , or the clone wars ? 
  i 'm talking about the former ( since that 's the one you named earlier ) , which as far as i 'm aware is n't on netflix . 
  i 've not seen the newer cgi remake of the show . 
  fwiw i asked my dad , who 's a queenslander through and through , ` if i said `` port '' to you , but was n't talking about boats or alcohol , what would you take that to mean ? ', 
  and he got it instantly . 
  i read it , that 's why i 'm even willing to * consider * a voting speaker . 
  i 'm just not yet convinced that it 's necessary , and is n't just an attempt at patching a more broadly flawed system . 
  edit : as for the other models , yes i 'm dismissing them . 
  i have zero interest in them , and the more this system becomes like them , the less interesting or worthwhile it is . 
  if gaining more members means sacrificing integrity , then count me out . 
  as far as i can tell , your understanding is mostly correct . 
  the blinding process can not be replicated by anyone other than alice , because that 's how cryptographic blinding works . 
  s = alice has been recorded , but because you 're unblinding it is n't sent during the actual voting stage . 
  i suppose the equivalent using your notation would be that it 's not s that is used in step 3 , but s . they can verify that t was signed by the voting system 's private key , but not exactly what was actually signed at the time . 
  like the stamp through carbon paper and a sealed envelope analogy that 's often used to describe cryptographic blinding . 
  the registration system in step 2 is what provides your requirement in the second step . 
  it accepts her registration iff nobody has registered with her credentials already & & her credentials are considered to be those of a valid voter . 
  exactly how that second criteria works is implementation specific . 
  in australia , currently one can * change * their enrolment details , such as saying they 've moved to a different electorate or have new contact information , very easily over the internet . 
  i imagine this system would aim for a similarly low barrier of entry to register at each election ( since it does now require that people register every election , instead of just once * ever * , plus updating details when they move ) , but the initial registration ( the first time you vote ) would be higher . 
  but that 's sort of out of scope for this problem . 
   i am building a system that is self-sustaining, 
  what ? 
  you 've been one of the * strongest * proponents of the more centralised approach which is far ** less ** self-sustaining than the old one , with the ever-growing powers of the moderators and head mod . 
  i did not * ignore * the post . 
  i just reject the idea that it 's entirely accurate . 
  it certainly describes the symptoms very well , but i 'm not completely sure it gets to the heart of the problem . 
  nevertheless , the whole post is the very reason i 'm even open to the idea of a voting speaker . 
  i 'd still prefer not to , but i can see why there might be a need . 
  as for jnd , he was extremely helpful , but his role at least in aiding the speaker decreased over time as speakers became more familiar with their job and the standing orders . 
  a new speaker needs that help at first , but once they 've got the hang of things , whoever is doing the helping can back off a little and step in when they mess up . 
  in the long run , new speakers could be aided by old speakers instead . 
  hahaha i wish i could say the same , but no res on mobile . 
  you forgot, 
   crushed amongst your own team unable to move anywhere, 
  if it were about an individual making a decision for themselves , then i would agree with you . 
  but this is a parent making a decision for someone * unable * to make their own . 
  bad science and ignorance are neither excuses nor valid defences . 
  i fully support bodily autonomy and a person 's right to choose what happens to their body . 
  irreversible procedures should not be taken on a person who can not or did not make the choice to undertake it themselves . 
  but vaccines ** do not ** cause harm to the recipient ( and i would certainly never argue in favour of forcing vaccines that have not been sufficiently tested and approved on * anyone * ) , they are an entirely beneficial procedure . 
  and not particularly invasive , either . 
  the good of the child overrides the parents ' delusions . 
  and that 's before we get into the need for herd immunity to stand , to protect those who * ca n't * be vaccinated . 
  which just adds a whole other layer to this that only weakens the `` vaccines optional '' argument . 
  i 'm sure you 're aware that there are diseases that had been nearly entirely eradicated that are resurfacing thanks to anti-vaccers . 
  a more sane law would have prevented this , because anti-vaccers should not be allowed to have their way . 
  i just can not see how you can justify * not * vaccinating * everybody * in the face of the risks to the child and the community if you do not . 
  as for the sky fairy thing , do you believe that exemptions to laws should be made on the grounds of religion ? 
  put aside everything else , if you consider a law x to be generally good , but religion r disagrees with x , should they be allowed to ignore it ? 
  because i sure as fuck do n't . 
  the law is the law , and it should n't matter what fantasy you believe justifies ignoring it , whether it be zeus or the abrahamic god , a flying spaghetti monster , or the voices in your own head . 
  if you * do * think it 's justified , how do you decide * which * religions get to count ? 
  can i just declare `` i have a religion that does n't believe in paying taxes '' and then be exempt from paying taxes ? 
  the timing attack thing is one reason , but the other is just to simulate the way things are already done with regards to registration . 
  currently , registrations close a few weeks before the election . 
  you certainly could do them at the same time , or maybe have the software just wait a random amount of time ( a few minutes , perhaps ) , if you wanted to . 
  [ this is n't the sheet music op was using , but it 's the one i 've been playing from , and personally i think it 's a little nicer arrangement . 
  ] ( https://parkarts.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/104598229/toy%20story-youve%20got%20a%20friend%20in%20me-sheetmusicdownload.pdf ), 
  yeah , this is definitely within the rules . 
  on a personal level , i do n't really see the * point * of it ; it does n't interest me . 
  but i wo n't remove it . 
  how did i not know about this before !, 
  i go in the opposite direction a lot ( using ` open . ` ) , but my usual method to go from finder to terminal involves dragging a file from that directory and then backspacing through the actual file name . 
  a tedious amount of work . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever had a need for plumbing skills . 
  personal finance feels to me more like something parents should be teaching , but i can see room for schools to do a bit of it , to make up for financially challenged parents . 
  personally , my school did one class on it . 
  about 80 minutes . 
  the same amount as they spent teaching cooking . 
  the simplest answer is that it 's something parents should be doing . 
  obviously , many do n't , and that is a problem . 
  so perhaps schools should be picking up the slack . 
  yeah i know about that , but the target is really small and i more often than not end up dragging the window around . 
  plus it 's still a lot more clumsy than that tool appears to be . 
  quality  quantity, 
  not that i 'm saying either of these is better or worse than the other . 
  i have never to my knowledge heard a john dowland piece , and i do n't even know who the other one is . 
  but for example , i hold beethoven in much higher regard than mozart , despite mozart being * far * more prolific a composer . 
  in particular , i suspect nearly * anyone * would say beethoven was the better symphonic composer , but he only had 9 compared to mozart 's 41 + . 
   and null chars, 
  what , but ... how ?
