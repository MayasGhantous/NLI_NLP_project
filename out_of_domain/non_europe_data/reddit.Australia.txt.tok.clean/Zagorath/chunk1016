  note that the only result to it is this very thread , which means it had never been indexed by google until he said it . 
  mine has an 8 character limit . 
  but they also lock you out if you make a mistake 3 times , and to transfer money out of your account they require 2fa ( or a second , separate code , which they generate for you rather than letting you choose ) . 
  i believe their reason is to minimise support requests from people needing help remembering their password because it was too long . 
   are those 0-indexed for you ? 
  all ordered lists on this subreddit are automatically converted to be 0-indexed , by the subreddit css .

   if he turns out to be the character that plays adult bruce and batman in this series i will be shocked, 
  i will too , but that 's because i 'll be shocked if * anyone * plays adult bruce and batman in this series . 
  if * someone * does , i 'd be shocked if mazouz is n't the one that does it -- at least if they do n't time jump , and i ca n't see them doing that . 
   i do n't believe moderators or the community at large ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) is against direct links to dms guild to begin with, 
  direct links to the dm 's guild are not allowed . 
  text posts with a link only . 
  also , most of the community * is * rather negative on the guild , and for good reason . 
  op here is doing the right thing , but the vast majority of content on that site does not go through the same process of feedback and refinement , and the site does n't do anything to fix that . 
  it 's perfectly happy with low-quality stuff clogging up the user 's experience . 
  getting feedback here and * then * uploading to the guild after a few rounds of feedback and improvement is a * fantastic * idea , and we would fully support it . 
  people who do things the other way around ( which is most stuff that happens on here with the dm 's guild ) is less well received in general , though we do allow it . 
  in that case , yes , it 's perfectly acceptable . 
  you know what , that 's actually a really good idea . 
  it would vastly simplify the whole thing , especially since it would make in-person polling booths possible for those unable to vote using their own computers . 
  the only issue there would be needing something that can be used to authenticate the user , since impersonating would be far more common/easy with an online system than with the in-person paper system . 
  with the current system , * all * they do is ask for your name and address , but an online one would probably need a password or similar . 
  but that 's no huge issue all things considered . 
  maybe a driver 's licence , passport number , or some similar relatively private piece of information that does n't need to be memorised . 
  but yeah , that 's actually a really handy idea in general . 
  it solves a lot of problems . 
  ca n't believe i did n't think of it myself : so obvious in hindsight . 
  if the stuff that you 've posted on here is here to stay , then what you do with it afterwards is totally up to you . 
  i do think it would upset people if a finalised version ( at least in terms of mechanics , perhaps not visual design ) was n't shared , after feedback from this community was used to create that version , however . 
  what did it say ? 
   4e really should have been called magic : the gathering : the roleplaying game, 
  i 've seen people describe it as wow on paper , and i think that 's a stupid description . 
  but it 's * miles * better than this one . 
  at least both 4e and wow involve playing * characters * . 
   fyi i use a double lip embouchure on sax, 
  really not an option on the clarinet . 
  rather unfortunately , it 's * far * harder to go from sax to clarinet than the opposite direction , largely due to the far less strict embouchure needed on the sax . 
  the clarinet needs to be played with a single lip embouchure , and it also needs to be really tight ( not in terms of the actual strength of your lips , per se , but in terms of being accurate and consistent -- tight in the sense sports players practising a particular set play might use the word , not tight as in how you tie a rope ) . 
  as a side note , * no vibrato * . 
  this is probably obvious , but it bears saying just in case . 
  lip vibrato is quite common on the sax , and you may have used diaphragm vibrato on the bassoon . 
  unless you 're performing a solo work and going for a very particular effect , the clarinet should be played completely straight . 
  for embouchure , i 'm not sure about specific advice without a reference point to go from , but in general you 'll probably put less of the mouthpiece in your mouth than you would on the sax . 
  i 'm not entirely sure you understand what `` whoosh '' means ... 
  what exactly is the `` money issue '' on star trek ? 
  i was under the impression that they do n't * have * any money , since they live in a post-scarcity society . 
  a post on that subreddit was posted at 11:23 utc on wednesday , so it probably went down around then . 
  it means the person did n't get the joke ... 
  where in my comment does it look like i did n't get the joke ? 
  odd that this guy chose to rate sound cloud as one of the major sources , but not incompetech . 
  basically everyone who 's ever edited a video together has heard of kevin macleod . 
  a couple of sources that are a little less useful if you do n't know exactly what you 're looking for , but are * excellent * if you do , are :, 
  * [ imslp ] ( http://imslp.org/ ) -- a site mainly for sheet music of public domain scores , but which also hosts a number of recordings for many pieces . 
  if you want a recording of a classical piece that you can use , and you know exactly * which * classical piece you 're after , this is probably the * best * source . 
  * wikipedia . 
  many music-related articles will have little audio clips attached . 
  most of the time , these will be licensed under some sort of permissive license . 
  in rare circumstances they might only be there under fair use , though , in which case it may * not * be fair use if you were to take it and use it in your own production . 
  so do make sure the license is a permissive one . 
   so it 's a bit unfair , but some good is better than nothing . 
  it also gets the debate going and demonstrates that property speculators are no longer a protected species . 
  indeed . 
  do n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good , as they say . 
  seriously , the lack of reading comprehension / u/fruntside is showing here is just laughable . 
  / u/darkaceau was really quite clear here . 
  they * only * bit that they were referring to was the line about this being the best thing since whitlam . 
  and from that , frunt somehow gets the idea that it must be the best thing for housing prices ? 
  like , where does that even come from ? 
   you have some problems with communicating what you mean . 
  same thing happened yesterday . 
  you need to be more concise rather than saying one thing , but actually meaning another once you 're questioned . 
  they * were * entirely concise . 
  in fact , it would have been hard to have been * more * concise . 
  all they said was that calling this policy `` the best thing since whitlam '' is a bit nebulous a claim . 
  no mention in that of housing prices , so i 'm really not sure why you thought it had to be referring to `` the best thing for housing affordability since whitlam '' . 
  you need to work on your reading comprehension mate . 
  because the claim the article made was that this policy -- a policy that , yes , relates to housing affordability -- is the * best thing since whitlam * . 
  that claim itself has *** nothing to do with housing affordability *** . 
  and that is where your comprehension skills ( or lack thereof ) have failed you . 
  because the argument darkface made was against that claim specifically . 
  not the rest of the article . 
  either you have misinterpreted jessica irvine 's intent behind that claim , or you have decided that darkface was making a claim that they were not . 
  or both . 
  either way , you are the one at fault here . 
  the rest of the article is fine . 
  darkface said as much both in their original comment and repeatedly in other replies to you . 
  the only problem they have is with that one specific claim . 
  you misinterpreted what the other guy was saying . 
  i was trying to help you understand . 
  it 's not my fault if you willingly choose to remain ignorant and obstinate . 
  what are your second ( supergirl ) and first ( bell ) favourites ? 
  yeah , the only time an apostrophe is wrong to indicate ownership is `` who 's '' , `` it 's '' , and a couple other pronouns . 
  literally every other case , it 's not just acceptable , it 's pretty much the * only * way . 
  also remove the discrete graphics in favour of only inbuilt intel graphics ( unless the user shells out over 3000 for the very most expensive option ) . 
  bring back the cheese grater !, 
  as far as i 'm concerned , nothing 's worth playing after revelations , as far as story goes . 
  ac1 and the ezio trilogy had great main stories , but what was really awesome about them was the secondary story they were building up in the background with the `` real world '' character desmond . 
  it looked like it was leading to this really cool real-world showdown between the series protagonists and antagonists .
