  unfortunately , after revelations , ubisoft decided they did n't give a crap about the awesome bigger world they had set up , and turned the series into a yearly money-grab like a historical assassin-based call of duty . 
  gameplay-wise , i 'm sure the later games are okay , but i wo n't touch them on principle , because ubisoft said fuck you to all the fans that actually cared about the story that they had been building up . 
  it 's somewhat interesting , but rather lacking in a few ways . 
  you 've broken down all of the different desktop computers , but all laptops are for some reason grouped under `` macbook '' [ sic ] . 
  your options for the use of apple products are missing at least two huge areas that i can think of , and probably even more : hobbyist artistic work ( video production , music production , photo editing , etc. 
  ) , and other types of hobbyist activity ( programming 's the only one that immediately comes to mind , but there could be others . 
  question 8 sort of presumes that people * do * have a `` sense of brand loyalty '' to apple to begin with . 
  it also would have been far more useful if there was a text entry box where users could specify * which * companies they have brand loyalty to . 
  grouping asians and pacific islanders together is a rather ... interesting ... choice . 
  hear , hear !, 
  that sub , and even / r/flashtv , are just shitholes because of all the circlejerking . 
  please do n't leak that into here . 
  [ lot/flash question/spoiler ] ( #s `` is n't snart dead ? '' ), 
  i have to ask mate , what were you thinking when you wrote this ? 
  i know it sounds snarky , but i mean it in the most genuine way possible . 
  i 'm just curious . 
  tbh i 've been unsubscribed from / r/flashtv for a long time now . 
  before the felicity circlejerk ( which was by far the * worst * that there 's been ) there was the `` everyone is jay '' circlejerk , or the patty one , or grodd . 
  they 're all dumb and incredibly unfunny . 
  none of those were as bad as the felicity one , but they completely turned me off of the subreddit . 
  oh yeah , i tended to pop in for the discussion threads . 
  i just did n't subscribe . 
  probably better going to [ google scholar ] ( https://scholar.google.com.au/ ) or similar . 
  if you 're at university , your institution probably has an even better option available that you can use to search and get access to otherwise paywall restricted journal articles . 
  site : edu will only turn up sites whose domain * ends * in ` . edu ` , i.e. , * only * american institutions . 
  which is a problem , since there are a lot of other countries out there . 
  i tend to find that when i 'm doing a general google search ( rather than specifically scholar ) , the majority of useful stuff that 's not from my own country ( australia , where we 'd use ` . edu.au ` ) is from the uk ( where they for some reason use ` . ac.uk ` ) . 
  using site : edu would exclude all stuff both from my own country and from the most useful other one . 
  fair point . 
  personally it does n't matter to me what you call it , it 's annoying behaviour that drove me away from the sub . 
  but to get into the semantics , i think it 's a circlejerk because of how common it became to try and squeeze out any reference you possibly can to the meme . 
  any time anyone mentioned `` god '' , someone would inevitably reply `` not god , grodd '' and receive heaps of upvotes . 
  is `` network tv '' the term used in america for free-to-air tv ? 
  or is there some difference between the two ?

  yeah that 's what i thought it was until i saw the clarification . 
  true , but it would seem odd to put it on a poster anyway , would n't it . 
  [ got spoilers ] ( #s `` like if they had revealed jon snow was alive in the trailers for season 6 of game of thrones '' ) . 
  yeah this is fantastic . 
  reddit 's own search is infamously terrible . 
  even better , sometimes , you can do `` site : reddit.com/r\\/youshouldknow '' , or whichever other subreddit you 're looking for , if you want to search something about a specific subreddit . 
  unfortunately not . 
  it looks for everything that us part of the edu domain . 
  domains are hierarchical , so the only things in the edu domain are those that * end * in edu . 
  edu.au is a separate domain entirely . 
  and of course , even if it did work that way , the uk and other countries that use . ac.country ( ac for academia ) would n't show up . 
  ah interesting . 
  thanks for that . 
  so you can get it with just an antenna for free ? 
  what are the rules for this , beyond those of normal volleyball ? 
  like , i noticed or did n't seem to matter that the girl serving was slightly over the line in the second service . 
  another fun fact : everyone expected the spanish inquisition , because they gave people a 30 day warning ahead of time . 
  if it 's become popular thanks to a tv show , i 'd guess they probably learnt how to eat them from the show . 
  never did those american things . 
  gpa was 5.83 . 
  but calculating a gpa from ib is a little weird , since you either ignore the core ( which is what i did there ) or find a weird way of calculating it in . 
  similarly , you could choose to weigh hl and sl differently , or just calculate the average for all subjects equally ( which is what i did ) . 
  i just found out about this subreddit yesterday . 
  holy shit this is an amazing place . 
  such a breath of fresh air after how terrible / r/arrow and / r/flashtv are . 
  you guys keep doing you . 
  does n't work . 
  it 's still looking for the ` . edu ` tld , for the reasons described in [ this comment ] ( / r/youshouldknow/comments / 4pr0rz/ysk _ you_can_add_siteedu_to_the_end_of_your_google / d4noeh5?context = 2 ) . 
  if they 're a history or economics teacher they could be doing a very poor job of teaching their material , or presenting the material in a very misleading way . 
   i think google is smart enough to still find all au-based results even if they do n't literally have . au domains, 
  no , it 's not . 
  i mean , it * is * smart enough most of the time , but there are certain commands you can give google to make it override its normal smartness . 
  putting something in double quotes , for example , is overriding its normal intelligence to figure out semantics and look for something that means the same as what you searched for -- instead , it will * require * the exact string inside quotes . 
  similarly , using the `` site : '' keyword will * require * that what it returns is a part of that domain . 
  and no , the leading dot should n't be necessary or make any difference . 
  you can think of domain names as being hierarchical . 
  anything that ends in ` . au ` is a part of the same ` au ` domain . 
  but there are subdomains of ` au ` , such as ` com.au ` and ` edu.au ` , which are their own domains , but also are subdomains of the au domain . 
  going a step further , you can have ` uq.edu.au ` or ` qut.edu.au ` : both of these are subdomains of ` edu.au ` , and are at the same time their own domains . 
  what the site : keyword does is search for everything that is a part of the specified domain . 
  ` au ` is a domain , ` edu.au ` is another domain , etc. 
  so it will * only * return results that are in the domain you asked for . 
  a leading dot really does n't mean anything in the context of ` au ` , since it 's a tld that has no actual pages on it as a domain . 
  in another context , though , i 'm not so sure . 
  there could , theoretically , be some content on , for example , ` reddit.com ` ( in reality , reddit redirects it to ` www.reddit.com ` ) . 
  how google treats the leading dot in this case could be interesting . 
  maybe a search for ` site : . reddit.com ` could turn up * only * things that are part of * any * subdomain of ` reddit.com ` , but * not * ` reddit.com ` itself directly . 
  or maybe google just ignores the leading dot entirely . 
  to test this out , you 'd have to find a site that has content on its own domain directly , and * separate * content on any subdomains , including ` www ` , which could be tricky . 
  i do n't know if the tilde and asterisk commands would do anything today . 
  google tends to search for synonyms anyway . 
  the point is that the uk leaving the eu will very likely not actually * help * you to get what you want . 
  in all likelihood , they 'll end up allowing similar levels of immigration as a concession in order to allow beneficial trade deals with the uk . 
  youtube is actually directly under google , which is under alphabet . 
  yt did n't get spun off with the alphabet switch . 
  pretty sure the guy you replied to knew this . 
  they 're likely referring to the phenomenon of * facebook * users freebooting videos from youtube and putting them on fb , where the creators get no credit or income . 
  hmm , curious . 
  how would that by different in practice ? 
   if i was born to two australian citizens , removed from them by the queensland government and adopted out to two other australians citizens , how can i not be a citizen ? 
  seriously , what the fuck . 
   you do n't have to draw 5 individual lines and attempt to line them up . 
  especially when trying to draw a 4-sided shape . 
  yeah sorry , he 's obviously misheard the name of the party mascot , job sandgroth .
