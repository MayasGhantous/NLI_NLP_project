   is it really a sensible move to talk shit to someone armed with a gun , taser , capsicum spray , baton and handcuffs who can make your life miserable with seldom any consequence to themselves ? 
  pretty sure their point was that you * should n't * be talking shit to * anyone * , regardless of whether they can threaten you or not . 
  i 'll just pipe up and say that here in australia we use the phrase the same way as americans . 
  oh , i based my answer purely on the actual reveal itself , and ignored everything else in the episodes . 
  still answered slade though , because the way they revealed him in present day was chilling . 
  was n't snowing in moscow when napoleon and hitler first started their invasions either . 
  somewhat mildly amused ? 
  is that more or less amused than very mildly amused ? 
  do you even s02e09 , bro ? 
  it 's not * fully * confirmed , but ned needed to protect jon * from robert * . 
  what reason would robert have to want to kill jon if his father was n't targaryen ? 
  it would be awesome if you could mix and match . 
  that 's what i was advocating for in the lead up to and aftermath of the last federal election . 
  unfortunately , no , you ca n't do that . 
  and it 's somewhat understandable , the extra option could be confusing to some people , and its behaviour is easily replicated by voting below the line and just numbering those candidates from parties you * would * have numbered above the line in the order they appear on the ballot paper . 
  tl ; dr no , you ca n't mix . 
  that 'll be registered as an informal vote . 
  oh gods could we please not ? 
  that butter joke is so incredibly not funny any more . 
  are you perhaps thinking of s03e09 ? 
  s02e09 is blackwater , the episode with the giant set piece battle . 
  and besides , i 'd hardly call the rains of castamere a * dry * episode . 
  even if you do n't care for all the talking , it 's not hard to be interested in the betrayal and murder that happens at the red wedding . 
   maybe there 's some first time voters out there, 
  to be honest , this is probably * less * of a problem for first-time voters this time around than it is for older australians , since it 's different from what older people have done in the past , while first-time voters are less likely to come in to it with expectations . 
  [ like this ? 
   you probably have at least 3 phone numbers memorized, 
  lol . 
  i wish . 
  my memory is shit . 
  i have exactly two numbers memorised . 
  my current mobile number ( 10 digits ) , and my old childhood landline number ( 8 digits ) . 
  who needs to memorise phone numbers these days anyway . 
  phone book apps take care of all that for you . 
  maybe it 's not * his * bike specifically ? 
  the family could have four bikes lying around , and on this occasion the kids did n't want to rude that one , so being a nice father , he let them take the big ones and rode the comically small one himself . 
  if you look at the different arrangement linked to by / u/pianosight in this thread , that one * does * have sheet music . 
  pretty easy piece , too , which is nice . 
   it took man of steel for me to appreciate superman returns, 
  oh man , this so perfectly encapsulates how i feel bout the films . 
  really your entire comment does , but that bit in particular . 
  it did n't even occur to me that pascal strings could be an option . 
  i 've only ever worked with c strings which , obviously , are null terminated . 
  to be honest , i would n't even know where to begin to try and work with pascal strings in a website , does n't the browser send a request to the server as a c string , normally ? 
  and for non-web applications , i can see how one * would * do it , though as most popular languages these days default to c strings , i ca n't see why one * would * go to the extra effort just to allow entering null characters in the string . 
  oh haha that ca n't be good . 
  i can fairly comfortably reach a 10th ( especially a minor 10th ) , and the leaps in this piece are still challenging at times . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the spam filter because you linked to quickmeme . 
  that 's actually a banned site on reddit . 
  i 've manually approved it this time , but in the future , please avoid linking to quickmeme . 
  oh wow thanks for letting me know . 
  did n't realise that non-mods could n't assign their own flair . 
  you should now be able to . 
  yes , because direct democracy has proven itself to be *** so *** great lately ... 
  they talk a good game , but it differs * very * little from a true direct democracy . 
  that `` saving political capital '' thing , which i have n't read into , sounds interesting , but not in a good way . 
  does it mean that if i choose not to vote on one thing , i then get two votes for the next bill ? 
  if so , ** yikes ** !, 
  that 's actually * worse * than direct democracy . 
  if that 's not what it means , then i fail to see the significance . 
  regardless , it 's clearly close enough to direct democracy that it would suffer all the major negatives thereof . 
  and the brexit vote , and trump 's presumed nomination as the republican nominee for president , both clearly demonstrate the problems with directly voting for things , rather than having representatives do the work . 
  are you british or american ? 
  either way , my condolences . 
  flash is actually great for creating animations . 
  just export them to proper mpeg videos , gifs , or some other format , rather than running flash directly on clients . 
  an appropriate time to come out with this , from my perspective . 
  gods it 's gotten cold here over the last few days . 
  weird minor point , it might be worth switching the tableaux around to put the male one in the middle , so it goes fmf rather than mff . 
  i 'd also suggest changing the sentence to `` there is a subtle power in winter , however ; a divine spark ... '' . 
  the current double commas just reads rather awkwardly to me . 
  cantrips * and * both weapons & armour * and * resistance feels like a lot for the minor 1st level feature . 
  most other domains get only one of these . 
  admittedly , rime is a bit weaker than other 1st level features , so perhaps that 's the tradeoff here , but winter acolyte still feels a little strong . 
  i like rime itself a lot . 
  really strong flavour , reasonable mechanics that can mesh really well with the right abilities , but is n't in itself too strong normally . 
  cold snap , improved rime , and blessing of snows are all fine . 
  i do n't know about the balance of blizzard , but i 'm not sure about granting half cover . 
  is n't there some wording in the phb about being `` partially obscured '' or something like that ? 
  would n't that be more appropriate ? 
  even if the effect is the same , getting the semantics right is important . 
  hey sorry , but i 've removed this for violating submission rule 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  if you want to ask a question or share a more vague idea and get suggestions on how to flesh something out , try asking [ in the arcana forge megathread , here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4oymt4/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
   i 've got a 6 page word doc that i do n't know how to convert to google, 
  recent versions of word should have an option to export to pdf . 
  that would be the best option . 
  you 'd then upload it to your google drive and share the link to that . 
  alternatively , you can go to google drive and upload the file directly , and it should give you an option to convert it to a native google doc file . 
  regarding the actual spell , the main version of it seems a little complicated . 
  adding fate points that the player has to keep track of and spend as a reaction feels like something that could/should be a class feature rather than part of a spell . 
  i definitely think the option to have the spell be cast as a reaction is better . 
   i would have preferred something more somber , subdued , and resigned than this, 
  i can see where you 're coming from , but i actually really liked the music . 
  it was super out of place , but that made the whole scene feel really awkward . 
  it gave the whole thing a strong sense of unease , like there was something seriously , seriously wrong . 
  and that was obviously the point . 
  rather than going the obvious route of sombre and resigned , djawadi went for a deeper emotional hit where something just * feels * like it is n't right even before there was any clear reason to think that . 
  to me , it worked * perfectly * in that way .
