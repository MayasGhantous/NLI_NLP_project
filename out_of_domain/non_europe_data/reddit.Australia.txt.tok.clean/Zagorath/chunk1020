  the next best is probably [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-7v_80eqzy ) , which is much , much more faithful to the piece from the soundtrack , and still pretty exciting . 
  no offence , but the arrangement in this video seems to achieve neither the incredible faithfulness of the second link above , nor is it as interesting to listen to or as easy as the first . 
  your performance of the arrangement is wonderful , and the arrangement itself is n't * bad * at all , just not as good as others that have already been made . 
  yeah if you ask me it 's a dumb rule that utterly shits on the idea of rule of cool . 
  someone wants to try smashing open a window with it instead of hitting the enemy ? 
  there 's no good reason not to allow it as far as i 'm concerned . 
  certainly , nobody in this thread so far has presented anything close to a cogent argument against it . 
  the response to that is simple : you ca n't target weapons a creature is holding . 
  similar restrictions already exist , for example * light * gives the holder of a weapon a saving throw to resist it being lit up , whereas unheld items are automatically lit . 
  i think the exact opposite is how things should work . 
  just because it does n't say you * can * target an object , does n't mean you ca n't , unless it specifically says otherwise . 
  there 's no reason that a beam of crackling energy * would n't * be able to be used to smash open a window or crack a support beam . 
  if you 're only going to allow things to work in the most obvious way as they are * specifically * described being used , you might as well play a video game , because having freedom to do things that make sense but are n't specifically programmed in by the specs is the entire point of tabletop rpgs . 
  so does this mean a level 2 ranger ca n't cast any spells with a material cost until they manually get their hands on a component pouch ( or the specific components for that spell ) ? 
  yeah , but that 's * lame * . 
  why * not * allow people to break windows and other things with the spell ? 
  the rules should n't explicitly define any of this , but leaving it vague is fine : that way dms are free to follow rule of cool and do stuff where it makes sense and wo n't fuck with balance too much . 
  explicitly ruling on it like this sage advice did ruins that . 
  sure , dms are free to overrule it ( i certainly will be ) , but it 's better if dms * do n't need to * overrule word of god to do this kind of thing . 
  but what he 's done here is explicitly state that the spell is not supposed to work on objects . 
  the spell itself does n't say that , it just says it * does * work on creatures . 
  it 's a subtle difference , but an important one . 
  it means that a dm who allows it to work on objects is now overruling word of god , rather than just allowing something that was n't explicitly allowed . 
  are you thick ? 
  how is that * possibly * an adequate justification it can only target creatures is the * conclusion * it 's not a * reason * for anything . 
  but you 're begging the question . 
  you 're using the statement that `` it can only target creatures '' as a * reason * that it can only target creatures . 
  there is no reason that i 've seen that even comes close to an adequate explanation for * why * it can only target creatures . 
  why ? 
  give me a good reason for that . 
  because so far you 've failed to even attempt to actually justify your stance . 
  nobody should christopher pyne . 
  it 's a very common theory that they intentionally make it difficult to use . 
  the possible reasons for this are many . 
  it creates a sort of lock-in thanks to the sunk cost effect . 
  it keeps the audience mostly among the younger people , with the difficulty acting as a barrier to entry for older users . 
  oh that 's a great point !, 
  i 'm sure the people in favour of this ruling would find some excuse to justify it , but as far as i 'm concerned that 's another reason that their point is ridiculous . 
  read the description for eldritch blast , the spell in question . 
  because it makes sense given the description of the spell . 
  because it 's cool . 
  because there is ** no good reason not to do things that way ** !, 
  how hard is it to get this ? 
  you should n't be restricting things that make sense given the flavour for no reason . 
  and yet you refuse to give a reason . 
  it 's absurd . 
  and somehow you have the gall to claim * i * have the burden of proof here . 
  you 're the one advocating for limiting and restricting player choice , which completely defeats the point of rpgs . 
  you should go play a video game if that 's what you want . 
  oh definitely . 
  we 're discussing eb here , but it 's an argument that works in the general sense as well . 
  there may be some spells where it makes sense to take the opposite position , though certainly all the obvious missile or beam like ones should work the same way . 
  sure , but the whole * point * of this conversation has since the beginning been that crawford 's ruling in this case was a dumb one . 
  using the ruling to justify the ruling is begging the question . 
  so far , nobody has really even tried to justify the ruling properly , which to me says quite a lot about this ruling . 
  yeah that 's not an ib thing . 
  your school is , for some reason , deciding to use a separate grading system on top of the normal one . 
  you need to talk to someone in your school about this , because it has nothing to do with ib . 
  how is that an `` explanation '' ? 
  it 's a * statement * that 's only correct if you * assume * things work in a way that does n't make sense -- at least without further justification ( and further justification has yet to be presented -- at least , nothing that adequately explains it ) . 
  the simple fact is that eldritch blast , like many other spells , is described in a very particular way , and if you treat the mechanics of the spell exactly as they are written like a video game and refuse to allow creative and interesting uses of it , you are not only being a bad dm because you 're restricting freedom , you 're being a bad dm because you 're creating mechanics that fail to fit the flavour description of the text . 
  it 's a bad ruling on crawford 's part . 
   and then either nominate 1 to 6 above the line, 
  careful now . 
  6 is just the minimum . 
  you can ( and ** should ** ) number more than that , if you do n't want your vote to be exhausted prematurely . 
  you do n't need to number the whole thing . 
  just that 6 is way too few when there are 36 + groups and you 're electing 12 people . 
  at the very least , the preference should include 2 of the 3 major parties , and then there are heaps of minor parties out there to satisfy absolutely any niche . 
  it 's not exactly hard to find 10 -- 15 parties worth putting somewhere on the ballot . 
  if your vote gets exhausted early , it means not only do * you * not get a say , but you 're giving an increased amount of weight to the votes of everyone who * did * give a more complete preference , since the number of votes needed to meet the quota will be reduced . 
  i 've never not voted somewhere inside , so i do n't predict sun being an issue while in line to vote , either , even though up here it probably * will * be sunny . 
  it 's a variant of the [ dvorak keyboard layout ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/kb_united_states_dvorak.svg/2000px-kb_united_states_dvorak.svg.png ) . 
  that 's a layout that is vastly superior to qwerty for regular typing . 
  i rearranged some of the symbols to create a coder 's dvorak layout , putting useful symbols for programming , like brackets , braces , and square brackets , in easier to reach locations . 
  i based my coder 's dvorak on [ the programmer 's dvorak ] ( http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ ) layout , which is in my opinion a really stupid layout , for a variety of reasons ( not least of which is that it puts the numbers out of order -- the first thing i fixed in designing my own layout ) . 
  i 'm choosing to interpret this as one of those 3x3 alignment charts . 
  imagining mercy as chaotic evil amuses me . 
  well , the rules do n't say you can * only * target a creature , they simply describe the expected use case . 
  the conversation has essentially just looped back to the start , because i feel like [ my first comment in this chain ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 4qnhuv/sage _ advice_june_2016 / d4upkjt ) becomes appropriate again . 
  but the rules ** do not ** say that you can only do one thing . 
  in general , d&d is not about restricting player options . 
  if a rule does n't say you ca n't do something , then there is no reason to assume you ca n't . 
  would you dispute that ? 
  ah , fair enough . 
  thanks . 
  that 's ... really lame . 
  yeah , i 'm gon na go ahead and continue ignoring that rule . 
  it 's not like it comes up that often or has any effect on balance or anything , anyway . 
  but thanks for pointing it out . 
   `` a beam of crackling energy '' does not imply any kind of physical heft in the spell, 
  i do n't see how it possibly could be interpreted in any other way , but if that is n't enough for you , how about the description of force damage , the type eb deals :, 
   pure magical energy focused into a damaging form . 
  no , the link is fine like this . 
  we only do n't allow dm 's guild as * link * submissions . 
  linking to them in a self post is fine . 
  personally i found about a 1/3 increase in speed , which is pretty substantial * , but yes , in general the speed increases are fairly nominal compared to the other benefits , like comfort and reduced risk of rsis . 
  it 's mainly about amount of finger travel . 
  a far greater portion of your typing on dvorak is done on the home row than on qwerty , and the top row is much more common than the bottom , which adds up to be a far nicer typing experience , both superficially ( in how it feels to you as you do it ) and more substantively ( in terms of the health of your hand ) . 
  \\* in my case , it 's probably because i was only about 90 % touch-typing before , and had to occasionally glance at the keyboard , whereas by switching and forcing myself to learn it * properly * the second time around , i managed to perfectly learn to touch type .
