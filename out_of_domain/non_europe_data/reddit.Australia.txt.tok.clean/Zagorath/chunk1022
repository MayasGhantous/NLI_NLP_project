  i never said anything about basic income one way or another . 
  you do n't know whether i endorse it or not . 
   net neutrality ( less of a problem in australia ), 
  interestingly , i 've heard many americans who take a very absolutionist and ideological attitude towards net neutrality mention how some isps in australia ( and elsewhere ) give unmetered access to certain sites , and criticise this . 
  personally i see it as an acceptable and beneficial exception to the general rule that net neutrality should be maintained . 
  certainly , no site or service should be artificially slowed down or sped up , or blocked . 
   their biggest failing is in not endorsing global population shrink to 3 billion, 
  whoa dude . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i do n't even know where to begin with this ... it 's just ... so completely bizarre and out of left field . 
  completely fucked up . 
  you think a party 's biggest failing is * not * endorsing something that basically nobody * does * endorse , because it 's a completely extremist and unobtainable thing to aim for just ... what ? 
  side note , i think you need to fix your language settings on your keyboard . 
  you seem to be getting autocorrected to yank spellings . 
  i did n't vote for him ( okay , was n't eligible to -- i 'm in a different electorate -- but even if i had been , i would n't have ) , but i do n't see anything wrong with this . 
  he 's just having a bit of a laugh with mates after achieving something pretty great for himself . 
  i do n't really think being humble is a very important quality for an mp to have , anyway . 
   i 'm starting to come around to the idea of spinning off nqld as a new state . 
  would n't that be worse ? 
  imagine if north queensland had 12 senators to themselves , instead of having to share them with the south ? 
  the flipped hands are weird , but is anybody else noticing that the two parts are n't aligned correctly ? 
  the treble clef has a quaver rest followed by a semiquaver , but that first semiquaver is lined up with the * third * quaver in the bass clef . 
  my suggestion would be to use [ this vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
  it 's a homebrew , but it 's one of the highest quality pieces of homebrew available for 5e . 
  i would suggest giving all of the features listed under `` child of the night '' -- or if you 'd prefer , just all of the * flaws * from that feature -- for free , and then allow the player to take levels in that prestige class to gain more powerful vampiric powers . 
  it 's a great player option that allows a balanced approach to vampires , while still being able to get * all * of the desired flavour associated with them , depending on how much the player chooses to invest in it . 
  the vampire template from the monster manual is , unfortunately , completely broken . 
  wotc did n't even try to make it balanced , and just made an option that feels like a super powerful monster of the night , obviously intended as a temporary thing . 
  to make a genuine player option for vampires * requires * that it have some sort of progression , because to lump it all on at once will by necessity be overpowered . 
  edit : added stuff relating to wizards ' vampire option . 
  make no mistake . 
  it is an ** incredibly ** harmful law , and is just the latest in a series of moronic laws in europe relating to technology . 
  the wikipedia article on the so-called right [ has a pretty good criticism section ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_be_forgotten#criticism ) which addresses some of the problems . 
  a few more decent explanations are [ here ] ( http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000938.html ) , [ here ] ( https://plus.google.com/+jeffjarvis/posts/mrc3dhq9dz9 ) , and [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/11015901/eu-ruling-on-link-removal-deeply-immoral-says-wikipedia-founder.html ) . 
  i have n't actually watched it , but i suspect [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27apkmn9azk ) would also be a great source , because jeff jarvis * really * knows what he 's talking about here . 
  if you can track down the relevant episodes , he 's talked about it many times on the podcast this week in google , but because of the nature of that show , it 's something that will have come up many times as the law was being proposed and then passed , and then in the aftermath of it , with no single definitive explanation . 
  but for a tl ; dr , i think wikipedia founder jimmy wales said it best :, 
   history is a human right and one of the worst things that a person can do is attempt to use force to silence another . 
   i 've been in the public eye for quite some time ; some people say good things and some people say bad things . 
  that 's history and i would never ever use any kind of legal process like this to try to suppress the truth . 
  i think that 's deeply immoral . 
  wow , and public domain , too !, 
  this is incredible !, 
  the recording quality is way higher than i was expecting as well , which is great . 
  hearing breathing and other incidental noises a lot , but the actual quality of the recording itself is every bit as good ( to my non-audiophile ears ) as professional recordings i 've heard . 
  and the incidental noises are n't * that * bad anyway . 
  is it possible to just download the map ? 
  my internet would not make playing on a server fun , plus i imagine you 'd get in trouble for blowing up the sept of balor . 
  using ints makes more sense because blocks are discrete , not continuous . 
  as in cor anglais or english horn ? 
  i assume by `` party/coalition '' , you mean that an agreement between parties to provide supply and confidence , and not necessarily a permanent or full coalition like * the * coalition , right ? 
  so what labor did with the greens and independents in 2010 ? 
  and that if no such agreement is made , it defaults to the party with a plurality of seats ? 
  will we though ? 
  they said they 'll get back to counting on tuesday , bit will they finish and finalise the results ? 
  either way , that just tells us who gets how many seats . 
  then the parties have to negotiate agreements like they did in 2010 . 
  ah right . 
  the two are not related ? 
  so if the seats fell 73-71 , and * all * the minor parties/independents supported that party with 71 , the party with 73 would still form government ? 
  that seems ... odd , to me . 
  or if it 's working in 24 hour time . 
  i mean , it 's not astonishing . 
  just plucked arpeggios , a pretty standard musical device . 
  still , quite interesting !, 
  i do n't suppose you 'd know the study in question ? 
  i 've done a search for the author they mentioned , and there certainly are a few peer reviewed articles on the topic , but the ones i 've found have been published * after * the livescience article . 
  the ones i found , if anyone else with access to journal articles ( or maybe they 're available publicly -- i dunno ) is interested :, 
   hodson , g. , & busseri , m. ( 2012 ) . 
  bright minds and dark attitudes : lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice through right-wing ideology and low intergroup contact . 
  psychological science , 23 ( 2 ) , 187-95 . 
  does lower cognitive ability predict greater prejudice ? 
  current directions in psychological science , 23 ( 6 ) , 454-459 . 
  as a side note , that same author also has a paper titled '' * is homophobia associated with an implicit same-sex attraction ? 
  * '' which i found amusing . 
  that paper is subject to betteridge 's law of headlines , though . 
  ryan is also a pretty large electorate that reaches a lot further west and south than just the st lucia/indro/toowong area . 
  and for those students that * do * live within the bounds of ryan , i suspect a lot are n't actually registered here . 
  i know i myself am in that situation . 
  i just never bothered switching from my previous electorate of lilley when i moved . 
  i agree with your conclusion , anime is terrible with horrible overreactions , ugly animation styles , and it does a poor job of making me invested in the stories or characters . 
  but i do n't agree with your reasoning . 
  it absolutely * is n't * made for kids -- at least not all of it . 
  i * do * happen to like a number of western animated programmes , including avatar and young justice . 
  but regardless , this is not the forum for this discussion . 
  / r/dndgreentext is about dungeons & dragons or roleplaying games in general . 
  it has nothing to do with anime * or * western animation . 
  i have removed this post . 
  i wonder why * psi bolt * seems to be vs. ac . 
  i quite liked the mechanic used in the original mystic class where it was an attack vs int . 
  timeless body is very much just a ribbon feature : something that would normally be added alongside another * real * feature . 
  and it 's not as though level 15 is one where you 're seeing other major features already . 
  blank levels on other classes are typically ones where things like higher spell levels are gained or improvements to existing features . 
  i do n't think the `` you can expend half of your remaining psi points '' aspect of psionic ascendance . 
  this would mean the cost of it is substantially less if used later in the day than earlier . 
  maybe that 's the intended effect , but it still seems odd . 
  the bonus proficiencies for telepathic psions seem like too much , to me . 
  i really feel it should only be one of those ( player 's choice ) . 
  the telekinetic proficiencies have the same problem . 
  how much can the user communicate using ** wordless communication ** ?
