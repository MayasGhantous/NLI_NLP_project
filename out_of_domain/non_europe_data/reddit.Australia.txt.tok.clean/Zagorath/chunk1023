  how long does it last ? 
  for ** telepathic presence ** , and any other features that involve using psionics to cast * spells * , you need a description of how psionics relates to magic . 
  can effects which would dispel or detect magic affect these ? 
  you could probably borrow the wording from wizards ' mystic class ( either version should have it , i believe ) . 
  in ** psionic dissonance ** , you need to define `` a ranged power attack '' . 
  i do n't have any particular problem with the disciplines . 
  overall , i ca n't say i 'm a fan of this . 
  it does n't feel like the mechanics strongly reinforce the theme . 
  it may actually be worse than wizards ' mystic from the unearthed arcana article , and that 's saying something ( as that class was really quite terrible thematically ) . 
  i want to see features like mind thrust and memory hole , where they start out as basic attacks but can be augmented by spending power points . 
  and some mechanic like that of wizards ' mystic that involves * focussing * on abilities -- that was one aspect of the class that was actually really cool . 
  this class feels like an awkward variation of standard spellcasters , which is a shame , because after how terrible wizards ' one is , there 's definitely a need for something better . 
  seriously . 
  she is a xenophobic moron . 
  there is no rationalising that . 
  there is no way to justify it . 
  we should not allow ourselves to be a nation that accepts open bigotry and racism . 
  pauline hanson will take this country back * decades * if we allow it . 
  what am i looking at , exactly ? 
  hanson is n't alt-right ... one nation is simply the modern equivalent of the new guard/centre party, 
   [ hanson is ] a proto-fascist and openly racist, 
  i 'm a little confused . 
  which is it ? 
  i do n't actually believe this , but tinfoil hat theory : oakes and sportsbet were in cahoots on this as a way to drum up attention and goodwill . 
  if you absolutely need something * today * , sibelius , by far . 
  finale is extremely cumbersome to use and has an extensive learning curve , and at the end produces a lower quality result , unless you go to a much greater amount of effort to get something looking nice . 
  the free options have a tendency to produce * really * bad looking scores . 
  i would * highly * suggest * not * going with one of them , and \\* ahem * acquiring sibelius instead . 
  however , if you can wait , steinberg 's new programme , dorico , will finally ( after years of hype and anticipation ) be releasing q4 this year . 
  by all accounts , it will blow everything existing out of the water . 
  and as sibelius is no longer being developed as extensively as it once was ( avid fired its dev team and hired a cheaper replacement ) , dorico is the way to go for something that will continue to get better over time . 
  it will absolutely be worth acquiring a copy of this rather than any of the existing programmes , if you can . 
  oh wait , so `` centre party '' refers to an actual specific party , and one that was * not * at the political centre ? 
  i was assuming that you were referring to something actually centrist . 
  cheers for the clarification . 
   but you can put anything you want there including something shorter , like just y, 
  this is one of my favourite features . 
  i have `` yt '' set up for youtube , `` wp '' for wikipedia , `` r '' goes to reddit.com/r/%s , `` img '' for a google image search , etc. 
  it makes using the browser so much easier !, 
  really ? 
  because what i took out of it was that he was being * very * definitive in that he * would n't * be challenging the leadership . 
  i left that interview with no doubt in my mind , anyway . 
  if there 's one field where google + is n't completely dead , it 's among photographers . 
  on a site for photographers , sharing the exif data is pretty much a must , because people like to know how something was done . 
  occam 's razor is about assuming the least things in order to reach a conclusion . 
  basically , the simplest explanation is the most likely . 
  it 's a bit different because rudd was widely disliked in his party , but was seen as a better option by the public . 
  conversely , the public despises abbott , but he 's at least fairly well liked within a certain faction of the party . 
  but indeed , it is fascinating seeing nearly the exact same events playing out from the opposite side . 
  yeah , he hates all religions equally . 
  definitely not racist . 
  the name of a gay man . 
  but that 's * exactly * the point ... 
  fuck it . 
  you 've convinced me . 
  let 's do it . 
  +3 from the stats , +0.5 from the extra movement . 
  +1 ( at least ) for the flight speed . 
  +0.5 for darkvision . 
  +1 ( at least ) for super strength, 
  magic vulnerability would probably be -0.5 , but it 's an * extremely * unorthodox approach . 
  you should ** always ** avoid giving static penalties where possible . 
  it would be far more reasonable to give disadvantage on saving throws , * or * ( certainly not * and * ) give vulnerability to damage from magical effects . 
  that would probably be -1 or maybe even -1.5 . 
  +1 from heat vision . 
  -0.5 from sun powered . 
  i 'd give it a total of +6 as it is , and maybe +5 or +5.5 if it used the recommended change to magic vulnerability . 
  personally , i 'd also suggest changing sun powered . 
  a single day without sunlight is a bit unreasonable . 
  superman himself has been seen going longer than that . 
  maybe a full week would make it less of a problem . 
  to balance out the vulnerability being such a substantial hindrance , i would suggest x-ray vision as another one of the more core powers kryptonians tend to have . 
  i can see where you 're coming from , but i actually really liked the music . 
  it was super out of place , but that made the whole scene feel really awkward . 
  it gave the whole thing a strong sense of unease , like there was something seriously , seriously wrong . 
  and that was obviously the point . 
  rather than going the obvious route of sombre and resigned , djawadi went for a deeper emotional hit where something just * feels * like it is n't right even before there was any clear reason to think that . 
  to me , it worked * perfectly * in that way . 
  plus , it provided an absolutely fantastic piece to play on its own on the piano , far more so than any other piece from game of thrones , which is great . 
  yeah sorry , but that argument is frankly nonsense . 
  i mean , even if we accept the premise , it does n't hold up , since djawadi * already * uses * heaps * of instruments that were n't around in the medieval period . 
  modern orchestral strings sound * very * different from the viols of the renaissance , let alone whatever was used during the medieval . 
  prior to the baroque , reeded woodwind instruments ( like the clarinet and oboe ) were exceedingly rare and much , * much * simpler than that used by djawadi quite frequently , and again , that 's * still * talking about a period slightly after the medieval . 
  the flauto traverso did not become common until the baroque , either . 
  brass instruments were * very * fundamentally different in earlier periods , far more so than the previous mentioned families . 
  you could probably get away with using viols and medieval woodwind , but if you were trying to perform the game of thrones score on pre * classical * ( or maybe even * romantic * ) brass instruments , it is just not going to work at all . 
  percussion is much the same , though i must admit , from memory , i ca n't remember how much is used in the scores . 
  oh , and that 's all ignoring the fact that djawadi has , in fact , scored for * electric string instruments * in the past . 
  i ca n't recall from memory exactly where it 's used or what instrument it was , but the theme he uses during rough one-on-one battles very clearly involves an instrument with electric pickups . 
  to put it simply , the game of thrones score has ** never ** been one compatible with medieval period instruments . 
  to criticise the most recent episode 's score on that grounds is an accusation that simply does not hold water . 
  it has * always * taken after the romantic composers , with a few more modern twists , just like the scores of williams and shore tend to in their best works , but with twists on that like the electric instruments and , in the latest episode , piano , that work to reinforce the unique mood of game of thrones in how it differs from the more romanticised style of medieval fantasy embodied by lord of the rings . 
  marmite is an evil horrid vile thing , and is utterly unaustralian . 
  honestly , that just does n't happen to me . 
  i rarely call people anyway , and the combination of my phone dying and needing to call someone has * never * come up . 
  hey , just commenting to give an official mod statement . 
  / u/barkalot is completely correct . 
  this is not the forum for tech support on the homebrewery . 
  i 've removed this post , but / u/stolksdorf might be along to give comment anyway .
