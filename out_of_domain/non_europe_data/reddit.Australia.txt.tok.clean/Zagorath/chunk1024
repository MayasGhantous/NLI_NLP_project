  more like another 13 % did a postal vote , since `` only '' about 93 % of those on the roll vote . 
  that 's exactly how the term might be used . 
   and japan . 
  and korea . 
  and chile . 
  to be fair , the parent comment did say '' * western world * '' 's centre , so those would be excluded anyway . 
  edit : formatting, 
  well for starters , he 's pretty much single-handedly responsible for just how badly labor was destroyed in 2013 . 
  the degree of instability in labor between 2010 and 2013 was the result of his political man\u0153uvring and causing unrest within the party . 
  but even before that , the reason he was removed from the position of pm in the first place was that within the party he was * intensely * disliked by other labor mps . 
  he was extremely difficult to work with professionally . 
  sure , he put on a good face . 
  there 's a reason the public ( including all of / u/maevam 's family ) liked him so much . 
  but that was a mask ; the face he put on to the public . 
  behind the scenes he was a very different man , and this is a well known fact to people who follow such things . 
  but the majority of people * do n't * follow such things ( why would they ? 
  ) , so he 's left with a mostly positive image . 
  it 's a party along the same lines of ukip in the uk . 
  its leader ( pauline hanson ) has been described as `` australia 's donald trump '' . 
  it exists solely to be an outlet for racist bigots to spread their vitriol and horrid opinions in the political sphere . 
  hey , i 'm curious about what you think about the whole `` mediscare '' thing . 
  do you agree with the lnp 's assertions that `` mediscare '' was a fraudulent scare campaign , or agree with labor that the lnp would have privatised/significantly cut medicare ? 
  ( putting aside the sms thing , which i think most can probably agree * was * fraudulent to some extent . ), 
  and * completely * off topic , i 'm wondering how much you know about how the aec counts results in the reps. 
  i had * thought * that they used the normal alternative vote system , eliminating the members with the lowest count one by one and distributing to the next highest preference . 
  but talking to someone who acted as an aec supervisor this year , and has been a part of the staff for dozens of elections in the past ( still only `` day labour '' , as antony green put it on saturday , but quite experienced in that role ) , he seemed adamant that they would look at the two parties with the highest 1st preference votes , and simultaneously redistribute * all * the other votes to the higher preferenced of those two , leaving no room for a third party to catch up on preferences . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd have some knowledge as to which way this goes , either anecdotal ( which i would certainly appreciate ) or something more objective/definitive ( which i 'd prefer if possible ) ? 
  i would 've pmed this , but i figure this is late enough at night that not too many other people will see it , and it loosely relates to the topic at hand ( being about the ability of third parties to win a vote ) . 
  anyone can criticise the greens for their anti-nuclear policy if they want to . 
  that in itself ( while usually poorly informed ) is not a particularly problematic point of view to hold . 
  the problem comes when people use that to try and * discredit * the greens as a party * entirely * , as though that one `` bad '' ( in that person 's view ) policy makes everything else they do irrelevant . 
  such comments typically do not make the same criticism of labor or the lnp , and so one is left with the impression that they might be preferencing labor ahead of the greens , even though ostensibly their opinions mostly align with the greens . 
  wow , that 's actually a * really * interesting point . 
  wayne swan continues to safely hold lilley ( with almost as much swing toward him as the greens ) , in petrie , the greens are still well under 10 % . 
  but in ryan , while jane prentice safely retained her seat for the lnp , the greens saw a 4.3 % swing * towards * them , mostly at the expense of labor , who had a 2.3 % swing against them . 
  griffith was even more extreme , seeing a 6.9 % swing to the greens and 6.7 % against labor . 
  and of course in brisbane itself , the greens gained 5.2 % , and labor lost 3.8 % . 
  and to get back to lilley , swan has * considerable * star power and personal goodwill . 
  when he retires , who knows what could happen . 
  of course , it may well be a short-term thing , but if this trend continues , you may well be right , that brisbane could become a very interesting place to watch , with the two party preferred becoming between the lnp and the greens , rather than lnp and labor as in most of the country , or labor and greens as in parts of melbourne . 
  he did , but it 's highly unlikely that it had an effect on this particular piece in that particular way . 
  it 's not like he wrote the music in one continuous go and forgot what came before , so ended up repeating himself . 
  no , of course he would have been constantly looking back over the music : he knew exactly what he was doing . 
  bol\u00e9ro is , first and foremost , a study in timbre . 
  it 's about exploring the different ways instruments can be used together playing the melody , the rhythm , or the accompaniment . 
  to most effectively do this , the melody needs to remain fairly consistent . 
  ravel was a highly respected * orchestrator * , as well as a composer , and he created orchestral versions of many pieces written for piano , the most famous of which is probably pictures at an exhibition ; if you 've heard pictures , you 've almost certainly heard his orchestration , and not the original piece by mussorgsky for piano . 
  bol\u00e9ro is just another example of his mastery of this art . 
   i 'm not some sort of political messiah whose word is truth , obviously, 
  damn , and here i was hoping antony green was gracing us with his presence . 
  holy shit . 
  that so perfectly summed up how i feel about the greens . 
  i became a green voter first and foremost because i loved their economic policies and their stances on public services like education and healthcare . 
  it does n't hurt that i believe strongly in protecting the environment and am in favour of marriage equality , but that 's pretty much what i * expect * from the greens . 
  i wish they would focus more on their other areas . 
  i think that 's a big part of the reason scott ludlum became so popular , to be honest . 
  he was one of the biggest greens senators out there talking loudly about other issues like infrastructure and government accountability . 
  considering it was a double dissolution , i think a lot of people ( including myself ) would have expected the baseline would be an * increase * in their number of seats in the senate , so a drop by one is very disappointing . 
  but indeed , in the lower house , they did excellently . 
  kept their one existing , and came * very * close in at least two others , with substantial increases in their primary vote in many , many others . 
  that 's not how the burden of proof works . 
  hey thanks , that was an extremely helpful response . 
  for more detailed information , i would highly recommend checking out [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwzh_1ezsc ) , and [ this followup video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf1jv1etzvw ) . 
  [ this playlist of videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plmuts78zxryo9nku_cem-lhcnsnac2khv ) is also really worth watching , and while it 's long , it does also have most of the more worthwhile videos near the start of the playlist , so you can basically keep going through it until you ' r no longer interested , and get the best content in the time you spend . 
  subjects where they do n't do different timezones , i believe . 
  in fact , linking * anywhere * on reddit you can do this .

  how do you fight wild pok\u00e9mon ? 
  all i can figure out how to do is throw pok\u00e9balls at them . 
  also , how do two people battle each other ? 
  oh , that 's lame ... 
  so i ca n't actually play with friends ? 
  that was pretty much the main thing i was excited about ... 
  damn . 
  mine 's in much better condition than that . 
  barely makes it a day of * extremely * light use , painfully slow switching apps or doing other things , and of course the well known problem with the camera restarting and the poor responsiveness in the power button . 
  but other than that it does pretty much work properly . 
  what does being a beta tester have to do with it ? 
  yeah i agree . 
  i came back in briefly when my city hosted an anomaly , so i 've reached 9 , but i definitely do n't find the `` endgame '' anywhere near as engaging as the process of levelling . 
  and from what i 've seen , the game has gotten really dependent on microtransactions and stuff like that recently . 
  i remember when it was just resonators and xmps :(, 
  that does n't surprise me a whole lot . 
  samsung is infamous for being pretty shitty about getting updates out : the s3 can only get to kit-kat . 
  my nexus 4 , which was released in the same year , goes to lollipop , and it 's working on that . 
  what os version you running ? 
  my sister just got her results . 
  got exactly what she wanted/expected for the main subjects , but two cs for tok and ee . 
  she was predicted two as . 
  fuck the marking for those subjects . 
  i think the idea of them is great , but the incompetent nature of their grading system just ruins it in my opinion . 
   in all editions it has been an automatic hit, 
  actually not true . 
  in 4e magic missile was an attack , int vs. 
  reflex . 
  gon na be honest , i 'm pretty damn disappointed with it so far . 
  i quickly found out that you apparently ca n't duel your friends . 
  like , what 's the point of the game without that ?
