  i 'd do a single decrescendo all the way down to piano . 
  also , you should learn how to properly engrave dynamic markings in your score writing program . 
  what you 've written here is displaying as expression text rather than proper dynamics ( with the bold font of normal dynamic markings ) . 
  why 'd you cross put unheard and replace it with unlikely ? 
  you were right the first time . 
  tom scott is absolutely great , and every specific argument he made in that video is completely correct . 
  however , he 's actually missed a key point that makes online electronic voting work . 
  blockchain technology is n't a magic fix-all , but it is a part of the solution , since it provides public audit-ability -- everyone can verify that their vote was recorded correctly , and can verify that the final result matches that of all the votes cast . 
  combined with some cryptographic technology called a blind signature , you can get complete anonymity in votes , while still ensuring each person only gets a single vote . 
  you 've got the foundation of a secure online voting system . 
  there are a few other kinks that need to be worked out , but that 's the basis of it . 
  [ you can see an explanation in more detail here ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 4n9ua0/blockchain _ smart_contracts_to_disrupt_lawyers / d424086 ) . 
  i may write up a self post about it describing the whole thing in more detail if there 's interest . 
  congrats on the switch !, 
  good luck !, 
  actually one huge advantage of a well-done electronic system is that it would be ** far ** cheaper than the current system . 
  you would n't need to print out so much paper , you would n't need to hire nearly as many staff , etc. 
  as for ` people will just want the insecure option anyway because `` oh it 's only an election '' ' , i absolutely disagree . 
  the aec and parliament would * never * be willing to change the way the system works without knowledge that what they are changing to would be equally secure . 
  there 's a reason that it has not yet been attempted : they are extremely cautious . 
  you 're absolutely right to be skeptical of blockchain technology when presented as a miracle cure . 
  it can not be used without care and still achieve both anonymity and one vote per person . 
  i 'm not familiar with veri.vote ( one of the ones mentioned in the above article ) , but all of the other voting systems i 've looked at have very fundamental flaws . 
  however , it is an * extremely * useful tool that can be used to * aid * a proper secure electronic voting system . 
  you can [ read more detail of how to achieve this here ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 4n9ua0/blockchain _ smart_contracts_to_disrupt_lawyers / d424086 ) , but the tl ; dr is that you use blind signatures in combination with blockchain technology to get verifiability ( both in the sense of individual users verifying that their vote was recorded correctly , and that anyone can verify the declared result matches the one associated with all of the cast ballots ) on top of the essential anonymity and one vote per person traits that paper already has . 
  how do you get control of a gym , when every one of them is already defended by 300 + cp pok\u00e9mon ? 
  urgh lame . 
  i do n't want them spending their efforts on porting a damn card game over to a roleplaying game . 
  there are so many great d&d worlds out there , and so far we 've only used 2 this edition . 
  give us more dark sun or eberron . 
  hells , i 'd even prefer to see a second generic medieval fantasy setting like greyhawk or dragonlance than a setting from a completely unrelated game with which i have zero interest . 
  age of empires iii is available on os x , and is a blast of a game to play . 
  personally it 's my second favourite rts , behind only age of mythology ( which is windows only , unfortunately ) . 
  nah man , i 'm completely with you . 
  i have zero interest in seeing them port over the worlds from an unrelated card game . 
  if i wanted to play in those worlds , i 'd play the actual card game . 
  from d&d , i want to see the great past settings like dark sun and eberron make a return . 
  to be honest , though i 've often said i do n't want them to do greyhawk or dragonlance ( because i do n't want them spending effort on another generic fantasy setting when they 've already got a generic fantasy setting in the forgotten realms ) , i 'd rather they did those than this . 
  malware is definitely a valid issue that can basically never be solved to my knowledge . 
  but anonymity is relatively simple ( though certainly not trivial ) to get working .

  the mining attack i * believe * could be mitigated by running on the public ethereum network , rather than any private smaller-scale blockchain .

  yeah in the 4 elections i 've voted in since adulthood , 3 have been walk ins , and 1 i had to wait like 2 minutes . 
  it depends on polling station , but i do n't understand why someone would n't just go to a different one if they 've got a 30 minute wait at the one they intended to go to . 
  there 's easily three or four within walking distance of the one i usually vote at , and far more that you could drive to . 
  surely for anyone not in one of the massive country seats this would be the case , no ? 
  amusingly , the australia card was the last time a double dissolution election was called . 
  no id is required to vote federally or in most state elections ( queensland is the only exception , i believe ) . 
  you have to register before you vote , but if you 've registered once , you do n't have to do it again unless you move . 
  you just go in , tell them your name and address , and they cross your name off a book . 
  anyone whose name is crossed off twice gets investigated . 
  in practice , it 's just not enough of an issue to swing the results . 
  in queensland , you can use basically any official id including passports and drivers ' licences as your id . 
  they also send every registered voter a special one-time id ahead of each election , and that can be used instead ( this helps make the system one that does n't cause disenfranchisement like many voter id laws in the united states create ) . 
  i definitely agree , especially since it fits in with the design of all the other books . 
  the special one would stand out like a sore thumb . 
  personally i thought [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuto5ygu7y4 ) was way cooler . 
  edit :, 
  [ cameron 's last waltz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gygfojwqycw ) is rather nice , too , and has by far the coolest name of the bunch . 
  [ cameron 's lament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cn6sqy_ljc ) is my least favourite of the bunch . 
  [ and this piano improv fugue of the tune ] ( https://www.facebook.com/classicfm/videos/10154431137584260/ ) . 
  i think it 's my favourite so far . 
  edit again :, 
  someone theorised that he was attempting to hum the opening of [ shostakovich 's fifth symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p0-wpoaztw ) . 
  can definitely see where they 'd have gotten that idea from . 
  yeah , i 'm with you . 
  for one thing , they said it 's a d # . 
  harmonically , it would make more sense as an eb , since then you 're working with a c minor triad . 
  that 's how i felt with dragon age . 
  i played through origins , but it was an awful slog , because the mechanics were just so incredibly terrible . 
  the story was really great , though . 
  i could n't bring myself to come back to it to play awakening , unfortunately . 
  i had just gotten too sick of the mechanics by that point . 
   faer\u00fbn is the name of the continent , and the planet is called toril . 
  and the campaign setting is called the forgotten realms . 
  it consists of abeir-toril ( both toril and its twin plane , abeir -- which is the origin of dragonborn ) , as well as the other planes associated with fr , like the nine hells of baator and the abyss . 
  okay , that map is awesome . 
  but i wonder , does one exist that looks more like a normal map of earth ? 
  with the split over the pacific ocean , rather than that bizarre method of splitting it down the middle of asia ... 
  aside from being more worthwhile in itself , it could be particularly interesting since that continent west of faer\u00fbn looks vaguely like the americas ( especially the northern half ) . 
  oh damn ... looks like they did n't release it on steam when they re-did everything :(, 
  i guess your best bet is to try and obtain the older version , either from someone who had the disks and is willing to sell them ( ebay might be useful here ? ), 
  or through less legitimate means . 
  they 're separate planes , but part of the same shared multiverse of the forgotten realms , in a way that , for example , eberron is not . 
  but yes , you 're right , the sundering storyline detailed their separation back to their current state . 
   splitting it over the pacific would cut anchorhome , maztica , & katashaka in half, 
  huh ? 
  no , leave the toril continents where they are , but shift earth over so that it displays the same way as on normal earth maps , with the prime meridian in the middle and the international date line near the left and right edges . 
  nope . 
  niantic was spun off from google quite a while ago . 
  ( edit : i believe it may have been during the alphabet switch , but niantic is not under the alphabet umbrella , either . ), 
  and even while they were at google , the official word was that the game did not get used to collect more information about travel patterns , which would imply that they were working * very * autonomously within google , since that should have been their primary use otherwise .
