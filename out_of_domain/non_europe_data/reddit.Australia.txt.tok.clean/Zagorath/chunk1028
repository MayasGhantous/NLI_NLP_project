  some causal relationship there , perhaps ? 
  farkin ' state of origin game was a total rort . 
  ref needs to be fired . 
  i do n't know about qut , but uq is fucking unplayable . 
  all the gyms are constantly packed with crazy high level pok\u00e9mon . 
  i hope the hype around this game goes away soon , because if * nobody * can ever hold a gym for a full day it 's gon na get lame real fast , let alone if a * fairly casual * player ca n't do it . 
  the game really does not explain a lot at all , even if this particular thing is n't true . 
  i got a pikachu slightly above cp200 from a 5 km egg . 
  still my favourite find in this game . 
  hey , same score as me !, 
  still infinite . 
  nsw were n't cheats , they played a fine game . 
  it 's the ref who clearly had no interest in a fair game . 
  your best bet is to post it as a submission with the request flair . 
  there 're a few at uq ( and probably more at other unis ) , and a few at toowong ( around the shopping centre or the re ) . 
  basically anywhere that had a heap of people playing ingress is likely to have overlapping pok\u00e9stops . 
  to be honest gps spoofing is just much less of an issue in pok\u00e9mon go than it was with ingress . 
  there 's not the same element of building fields in hard to reach locations , or blocking links that someone has to physically travel to in order to build their field . 
  these things make gps spoofing a massive scourge on the game . 
  in pok\u00e9mon go , a gps spoofer is mostly just ruining it for themselves . 
  as a bicyclist , is this where i get on board the hating drivers train ? 
  the victims here are the people who got water balloons thrown at them , not the people who took it upon themselves to throw them . 
  it 's niantic . 
  their business model has been known for quite some time , and it does n't involve selling location data . 
  they sell in app purchases and make sponsorship deals with local businesses . 
  that 's it . 
  eduroam is amazing !, 
  my uni 's been using it since i started there and it works fantastically . 
  even better , i went on holiday to the uk and visited cambridge uni , and all of a sudden my phone connects itself to the internet over their eduroam network . 
  awesome !, 
  oh that 's actually pretty cool !, 
  i was worried the antivirus installation would be ( at least partly ) a front for installing a root certificate so the uni could inspect even your https encrypted traffic ... 
  most likely to do with either the size of the antenna or the orientation thereof . 
  i had n't already seen it all over reddit , so thanks . 
  that was really cool . 
  i do n't know about the tokenisation bit , but the rest of that seems like an argument for * all * tap to pay systems , not phone ones , specifically . 
  all cards issued these days already support visa paywave or mastercard paypass , so you do n't need a special phone app to do it . 
  true that . 
  the antipode of madrid is weber on the north island , the southern tip of spain is up in that northern peninsula , north of aukland . 
  san sebasti\u00e1n tunnels to off in the pacific , half way between christchurch and chatham island . 
  not a police page , but good job on linking the source . 
   the simplest example is sonata form, 
  sonata form is one of the most complicated of the modern basic forms . 
  ternary is probably the simplest ( binary would be simpler , but is rarely seen ) , with ritornello/rondo being not much more complicated . 
  edit : just saw your edit . 
  my bad . 
  will leave this comment up just because it mentions a few other forms which are at least worth looking in to . 
  i 'm desperately trying to wait for the new phones this year . 
  i ** really ** hope the rumours of an earlier nexus release than normal are true , because my nexus 4 is just about on its last legs -- especially with pok\u00e9mon go killing its battery ... 
  i do n't know if i can hold out long enough ... 
  no it is n't . 
  oooh mod-managed external events sound awesome !, 
  i feel like question 2 needs more specific details . 
  how would you define active ? 
  fair enough . 
  by external i just meant events that are n't controllable directly by the members of this community . 
  i thought it seemed fairly clear that 's how it would be used . 
  ** super ** buggy , ca n't ( yet ) trade items/pok \u00e9mon or battle your friends , it suffers from some serious ludonarrative dissonance ( the player 's narrative/fun desire is to collect as wide a variety of pok\u00e9mon as possible , the game encourages getting huge numbers of the same one ) , and the game is far , far worse than ingress was in the sense that you just ca n't participate if you 're not super dedicated -- gyms are , at the moment at least , changing far too fast to ever hold one for the 21 hours required to get the payoff , and even if they were n't the controllers are super dedicated players who have multiple 1000 + level pok\u00e9mon . 
  and yet somehow , yes , it 's fun . 
  this is really * in spite * of the game 's design to be honest , not because of it . 
  were it not a pok\u00e9mon game , i do n't think i 'd enjoy it at all , but the feeling i got when i hatched an egg that revealed a pikachu inside was like nothing i 've ever had before in a mobile game . 
   events controlled by players from other countries, 
  oh that 's not what i was getting at at all . 
  by external i just meant external to what the simulation itself can provide on its own . 
  natural disasters ca n't be controlled by players ... 
  i do now , thanks !, 
  just claimed my first one . 
  i could have sworn others had told me that you could n't do that ... i 've missed out on probably 4 -- 6 of them because i captured the gym or placed a pok\u00e9mon in one captured by someone else , but did n't bother claiming the reward :(, 
  it 's a bit unfortunate , i think , that windows and linux do n't have a keyboard layout to do this for you . 
  on os x , there 's a keyboard layout called `` dvorak -- qwerty \u2318 '' , which temporarily switches you back to qwerty while the command ( \u2318 ) key is held , specifically so that you can use the same shortcuts as you would with qwerty . 
  i 've heard that there 's software that can replicate this type of behaviour on windows , but personally i 've never investigated it . 
  i 've had no problem switching between using the dq layout on os x and the standard dvorak layout on windows and linux . 
  / u/1 -21 gigawatts ' answer is completely appropriate imo . 
  you very quickly get used to the new positions of the shortcuts . 
  it 's just about how much you 've practised it . 
   i take q2 to support the proper implementation of the constitution to forbid players who participate as officials or politicians in other simulations in running for office in modelaustralia, 
  hear , hear !, 
  i mean , i do n't really see how the wording of 2 can be taken to mean that , but it 's something i would support nonetheless . 
  yeah exactly . 
  i really do n't see the big deal over that question . 
  of all of them , i thought it would be by far the least controversial . 
  well , at least you 're producing a cogent argument . 
  simply saying `` that 's idiotic '' like the other guy did is in itself idiotic ( which i was trying to demonstrate with my similarly curt response ) . 
  but the answer to your question is yes , i certainly would . 
  not everyone would , perhaps , but it 's not idiotic for those of us who would . 
  personally , i buy very , ** very ** few apps , so that 's not much of an issue . 
  i have only two paid apps that i can think of , maybe one or two others that i ca n't remember . 
  i use my headphones * daily * . 
  listening to podcasts is probably what makes up the * majority * of my phone usage , so it 's a big issue for me . 
  not that it matters for me , i 'm not an iphone user , so i do n't have as much to worry about . 
  i can say quit confidently though , that if suddenly all new android phones were being released without a 3.5 mm jack , i 'd be seriously considering switching to ios . 
  hells , i 'd seriously consider it if android stopped supporting headphone buttons and mics . 
  it 's not idiotic to * not * care about headphones if you do n't use them much , but neither is it idiotic for someone who does use it all the time to value having a phone with that functionality . 
  the linux equivalent of [ caffeine ] ( http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ ) . 
  to be fair , not many people used ingress ' in-game chat . 
  teams would tend to communicate via hangouts or some other dedicated chat app . 
  in-game chat is mostly useful for meeting new players and bringing them into the fold , to help them get involved with the hangouts etc. 
  with pogo , i suspect the reason there 's no in game chat is that it 's a pok\u00e9mon product , and they have a child-friendly reputation to maintain . 
  in all honesty , i 'm surprised they are n't policing usernames . 
  i saw a user named something like drfagg0t the other day .
