  there were two questions , the first was whether or not to make any change ( 53 % yes ) , and the second was which change should be made if there is any change ( 65 % become a state ) . 
  we must assume ( because there is no contrary evidence ) that this means 65 % of those that want any change voted to become a state , which means about 33 % of the total voters want to become a state . 
  that 's much smaller than the number that want to maintain the status quo . 
  he 's absolutely correct in that estimate . 
  until we know the actual percentages we * must assume * that it is split proportionally , and that 65 % of yes voters also voted statehood . 
  strictly speaking `` libertarian '' refers to beliefs on social issues only , and nothing about economics . 
  most of the libertarians on reddit , and the official libertarian party in the us , believe in extreme right wing economics along with the libertarian social policies . 
  see the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) . 
  ignoring the other districts issue :, 
  everyone answered the second question , afaik . 
  if you answered no on the first question , the second question is basically `` if some change * had * to happen , what would you prefer ? '' . 
  we still must assume that only 65 % of yes voters also voted for statehood , until more information arises , which means only 33 % of the total population voted for statehood compared to 47 % for no change . 
  this may not be true , it 's possible that the yes voters made up 90 % if state voters while no voters were mostly independence or autonomy , but until we know for sure we must assume that is not the case . 
  and then of course , the issue of all the other districts could make a big change to things ... 
  right , but only 53 % were unhappy with status quo . 
  that 's a tiny lead . 
  then , we have to assume ( until more data comes forth ) that 65 % of the yes to some change voters voted for statehood , and also 65 % of the no to change voted for statehood . 
  doing the maths that means about 33 % of the total population 's preferred solution is to become a state , compared to 47 % wanting no change . 
  besides , the whole thing is moot , less than 1/3 of all puerto rico 's districts have had their votes counted so far . 
  i have to say , that was my first impression , too . 
  i only changed my wording because someone else in the comments either here or in another thread on the same story said everyone answered the second question . 
  but if your interpretation ( and my initial one ) is correct , that means * for certain * that the largest vote went to no change at 47 % , as opposed to it being a reasonable assumption . 
  and i personally hope you do gain statehood . 
  it seems bizarre to me that puerto rico and other american territories are the only places in the * universe * ( yes , that includes space ) where a us citizen can not vote for the president of the united states . 
  even citizens originally from the 50 states who * move * to puerto rico lose the ability to vote . 
  citizens who move overseas , however , to countries in europe or asia , for example , can still vote from their last address . 
  it 's absolutely bizarre . 
  all this aside , the data we have now implies that the largest portion of puerto ricans want no change to occur . 
  if we could get the exact figures on how many people voted yes to some change * and * statehood on the second question , then we could work out for certain . 
  ( that said , i 'm getting conflicting reports . 
  some people seem to be saying the second question is only if you voted yes to the first : this would mean that the data we already have is adequate to state for certain that the largest portion of puerto ricans want no change . 
  some others are saying everyone answered both questions , and that if you voted no change that the second question meant something like `` if some change had to happen , which option would you prefer ? 
  '' : in this case , we need more data to know for certain , but until we have that breakdown we must still assume a proportionate split : 65 % of yes voters voted for statehood , and also 65 % of no voters did so . ), 
  i 'll end by saying i wish the best of luck to you and all other puerto ricans in this matter !, 
  additional source : i 'm australian . 
  australia 's similar . 
  much , much younger , but we based our system off of yours . 
  we also rarely have coalitions ( unless you count `` the coalition '' , which is a group of parties that a in a permanent coalition which together basically make up one of our majority parties ) . 
  yeah i agree , it seems more logical that a single question with four answers : no change , statehood , independence , `` sovereign free association '' . 
  but hey , who ever said democracy is supposed to make sense !? 
  out of interest , in your experience are there any obvious demographic trends with what people would like ? 
  for example do young people seem to be more likely to want statehood ? 
  what was his comment ? 
  i disagree about the genders . 
  if it 's not something he 's specifically interested in it just complicates things unnecessarily . 
  but i agree about the journalism question . 
  it should have been `` which of these statements are true ? 
  '' , and the answers should be slightly modified , for example the first would be `` journalism is a paid profession '' . 
  i also find it funny that so often the age groups will be correct for most answers , but there 'll be a single overlap , as with 21 in this case . 
  because he 's not interested in the more complicated genders . 
  it 's meant as a basic question to get some basic demographics , it 's not a social commentary . 
  all you want to know is whether a person is male or female . 
  it does n't matter what way someone `` identifies '' or what sexual organs they have . 
  honestly people act as though these extra genders are common . 
  i do n't know the exact stats but it 's such a tiny number it 's not going to throw off the answers anyway . 
  i have nothing wrong with people who identify as one of these other genders , but i do have a problem with people `` correcting '' someone else 's survey saying they `` should '' include them , when it will only unnecessarily complicate matters . 
  keyword there is `` unnecessarily '' complicate things . 
  other than that , see [ this response ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize/comments/12s7dz/as_a_redditor_i_would_appreciate_it_so_much_if/c6xrxob?context=3 ) . 
  for everyone else ( because `` it 's not correct '' does n't really help . 
  what is `` it '' , my first impression , or the thing someone else mentioned ? 
  ) , the correct answer is that the second question is meant to be taken `` regardless of your selection in the first question '' . 
  i did hear , however , from someone else , that some candidates were telling people not to vote on the second question if they voted `` no '' to the first . 
  i ca n't confirm this , because i 'm not in puerto rico . 
  star trek made me hate him . 
  i get that it 's not a popular opinion around here , but wesley crusher was an absolutely horrible character , and wheaton 's acting was terrible to match . 
  that 's just my opinion . 
  what do you think about the right to education , and whether it should be free for all ? 
   higher taxses are necessarily a bad thing , they pay for the protections offered by the government , such as healthcare , schools , roads etc. 
  just clarification , did you mean `` higher taxes * are n't * necessarily a bad thing '' ? 
  my only actual question is : ** how far do you think education should be free ? 
  ** i believe that * ideally * it should be free all the way through university , but i understand this is expensive and i only * expect * it to be free through secondary school in a developed country . 
  haha try translating to and from vietnamese . 
  ouch . 
  more introverted ? 
  fuck it , i 'm moving !, 
  it 's not really compared to `` typical american politicians '' , so much as `` compared to a historical , international , baseline '' . 
  also , political compass is great for comparing both economic and social issues so much more easily and efficiently than the words `` left '' and `` right '' can ever do .

  umm ... there 's no mention of that on there . 
  and it 's something i 've believed for a while . 
  are granola bars like muesli bars ? 
  if so , you ca n't get those there, 
  kinda like aus and nz ? 
  every time i see someone mention how low socio-economic mobility is in the united states , i see them get downvoted . 
  i 'm amazed at how reluctant people are to admit america has a huge , serious , problem with this . 
  [ the only developed country with worse socio-economic mobility is the united kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_mobility#worldwide ) . 
  i must admit that part of the statistic is quite surprising , but worth knowing nonetheless . 
   higher taxes do n't necessarily have to be bad , they just usually are . 
  actually , i got the impression that op made a typo there . 
  i think he meant to say `` higher taxes are n't necessarily bad '' . 
  other than that , it 's obvious that he meant taxes should be progressive whenever possible . 
  the us has problems wherein rich people typically pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than poorer people do , which is the opposite of how it should be . 
  people who make more money can afford to , and should , pay a higher portion of their income as taxes . 
  you think the us is the only country with wide varieties in cultures , languages , and climates ? 
  how about australia . 
  sure we 're famous for deserts , but we 've got rainforests , mountains , some of the world 's most beautiful beaches and seas to boot . 
  we 're also a hugely multicultural society , with a range of nationalities , languages , and religions . 
  sure we have n't had the same influence on the arts and business , as well as in scientific progress , but for our size i 'd say we punch well above our weight in those respects . 
  if you choose to be patriotic that 's great , but realise that not everyone is .
