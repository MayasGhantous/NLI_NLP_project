  he 's been in politics for literally one reason , and he now ( kinda sorta ) achieved that . 
  what better time to step down ? 
  especially if he can step down before any negative consequences are fully realised . 
  usually after braking , you stop . 
  i ca n't imagine using * any * of the ones people have suggested in real life . 
  i thought it was fairly clear . 
  i think people 's lack of understanding of statistics and probability , and the terminology used in them , is where the problem lies here , not in your script . 
  i can confirm , i 'm having the same problems . 
  thankfully , the unstyled version linked by / u/burning _ titan in a comment * does * work . 
  ## overall score : 9/10, 
  i must preface this review by saying i can not judge the visual design . 
  unfortunately , the document wo n't display past the first page . 
  instead , this review is based on the unstyled 1.1 version of the document . 
  ### content score : 9/10, 
  there are numerous very minor grammatical oddities , such as commas being placed in awkward places , weird word usage , or misplaced apostrophes . 
  however , for the most part it is written in a very engaging and clear way . 
  despite the immense length , it continually retains the reader 's interest . 
  perhaps its biggest problem , however , is its relative informal tone . 
  the author frequently addresses the reader directly , referring to `` i '' , `` my '' etc. 
  a more clinical tone , matching that of the other books , would be more appropriate . 
  the start of this guide provides a unified explanation of magical items , collating all the information scattered throughout the dmg and other locations into a single , logically structured handbook . 
  in addition , the guide provides some homebrew variant rules that can be used instead of or in addition to some of the official rules related to crafting , finding , and buying magical items, 
  the majority of the guide , however , is dedicated to providing many more new magical items . 
  magical items are some of the easiest and least controversial items for dms to homebrew themselves , but having a large number of pre-made items available for use is certainly very much appreciated , since it can take a load off of the dm from having to think of how to make something , or can provide a starting point for inspiration for the dm 's creation . 
  i do n't think i can find any particular fault with the items provided in terms of balance , however , some could be amended in terms of flavour . 
  mirror shield , i feel , should only provide resistance against damage from sources the wielder can see . 
  the soul binding contract is bizarre . 
  first of all , it suggests that * demons * are the most likely to form contracts . 
  demons , being wild , chaotic beasts , are not typically the type of creature to enter into contracts . 
  and yet , if they * did * , surely the forfeit in a contract with a demon , if one * did * sign such a contract , would involve their soul being sent to the * abyss * , not the hells . 
  normally , however , it should be devils , not demons , with whom contracts are entered into , and that would make the teleportation into the nine hells make sense . 
  the items i think are of the most interest to my flavour preference include the book of endless pages , the dust of disguise , the hourglass of time , the together feathers , and the memory ring . 
  i also think being able to use a potion to gain the effects of some of the less generally useful spells , like the potion of jumping , is a fantastic way to approach things . 
  some spells are just far too situational and gimmicky to be worth picking , so using potions to obtain them is quite clever . 
  while only one such potion was provided here , the idea of them is fantastic . 
  overall , this is great . 
  a couple of the items could use with some slight tweaking , and it needs a thorough close look over and revision , as well as the obvious need to be re-typeset in the stylised manner . 
  but aside from those minor issues , this really is a must-read for every dm interested in giving out magic items . 
  it comfortably earns its grade . 
  i did n't play it ( do n't have a ps3 or 4 ) , i watched a play-through on youtube where the player did n't talk at all . 
  it 's absolutely incredible . 
  the best story and characters i think i 've ever seen in a game . 
  this subreddit is really about roleplaying game stories , not a card game . 
  yeah , the point of material guidelines are to be general guidelines . 
  it 's probably actually only a very rare app that * should * follow each and every one of them . 
  instead , devs should aim to follow as many of the guidelines as possible , but feel free to break them as necessary for their specific app to be easy and intuitive to use . 
  i 've seen the 6p available in plenty of carrier stores , and the 5x in a general tech store . 
  wagner truly was an incredible storyteller , as well as composer . 
  i ca n't remember which , i 'm afraid . 
  only that there was no talking whatsoever , and that he edited it a little like a movie , often cutting out his multiple attempts at an area , so it flowed better . 
  very well written article . 
  people here will be glad to know the brisbane has an * extremely * strong and dedicated community of ingress players . 
  the enlightened have meet ups for drinks and farming every friday , organised over google + , and i 'm sure the resistance do much the same . 
  ca n't speak for other cities . 
  expired licenses are valid id for the purposes of getting a new license for a period of time . 
  i ca n't remember exactly what that time is , but it 's at least 1 year . 
  i 'd imagine the same would apply for other purposes . 
  century club ( cc ) is a subreddit for people with either 100,000 comment karma or 100,000 link karma . 
  triple cc is like that , but with 300,000 instead . 
  thanks for that . 
  in light of seeing the layout , i 'm amending my score . 
  ## overall score : 8.5 / 10, 
  ### layout score : 6.5 / 10, 
  i have to agree with other reviewers that the cover page does more harm than good . 
  in the die roll column of a random table , the content should be centred , not left-aligned . 
  on page 4 , the scavenging magic item tables looks really awkward . 
  suddenly switching to single column looks awkward . 
  its closest equivalent in the dmg is probably page 136 , but somehow that looks less awkward . 
  possibly because of how much more packed the page is both before and after the switch from 2 to 1 column . 
  the lack of artwork is also rather striking in such a long document . 
  the overall score does not match the average of the other two scores because i am choosing not to weight them equally , as i normally would . 
  this is to reflect the rather unique nature of this content , and the fact that about two and a half of the usual three criteria have been rolled in to one criterion in this case . 
  sounds awesome !, 
  but , uhh ... the images have stopped working . 
  apart from the one in the title , they 're all looking [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dvxfj64.png ) , and `` view image in new tab '' just says `` url signature expired '' . 
  how come the game seems to have types from after gen i ? 
  what they need to do is not have voting on a fucking tuesday . 
  put it on the weekend and you can guarantee voter turnout would skyrocket . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ compulsory ^ ^ ^ ^ voting ^ ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ help . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ suspect ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ many ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ americans ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ against ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 'cause ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ma ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ freedoms, 
  do make sure you 've also tried contacting them in person . 
  it may seem obvious , but it 's worth mentioning just in case . 
  they may not realise how much the noise is travelling . 
  edit : by `` they '' , i mean your neighbours , not the police . 
  [ i voted avgakln9b5k3jed6ylgpgte2afnrnvrngsfcn1e +0 ye ], 
  how many fights are they typically getting per rest ? 
  for better or worse ( worse , in my opinion ) , 5e assumes at least 6 encounters per adventuring day , and about two short rests per day . 
  that means on average , 2 encounters per short rest , and 6 per long rest . 
  an encounter is any time they may need to expend resources to achieve something . 
  this is n't * only * combat encounters , but many of them will be . 
  most classes have at least some resources that should be occasionally spent on social encounters -- especially casters . 
  if they 're going in to fights regularly with full resources , then even what should be a deadly encounter will be a breeze . 
  wait they do n't ? 
   going diagonal actually makes your ball go faster as opposed to going just vertical or horizontal, 
  oh wow , very interesting . 
  is that because vertical and horizontal speeds are calculated independently , so diagonal movement will get you the exact same movement in the horizontal direction as purely moving horizontally , or is it something a little more complex than that ? 
   how did they get plate armor that low, 
  16 +2 ( chain + shield ) gets you to 18 , as does 10 +4 +4 ( monks and barbarians ) and 13 +5 ( * mage armour * ) . 
  it 's pretty easy for characters who want it to get 18 ac , though indeed it still is normally at the high end , rather than the norm . 
   very , very good rolls,
