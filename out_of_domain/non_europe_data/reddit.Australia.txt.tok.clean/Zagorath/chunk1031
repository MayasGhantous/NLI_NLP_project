  not really . 
  the standard start for rolled characters is one stat of at least 18 ( after racials are included ) -- it 's the biggest reason i prefer rolled characters to be honest , point buy not allowing 16 is just far too limiting . 
  to have two of those by level 4 means just slightly above average rolls . 
  it 's something that would be achievable with point buy , if you allowed buying 16 ( but having it cost , say , 12 points ) . 
  a 16 ( +2 racial ) and a 15 ( +1 racial ) , so you start with 18 and 16 , then get to two 18s on your first asi . 
  sounds like your starting rolls were too good . 
  my guideline is between +2 and +5 for average starting stats before racials . 
  with certain exceptions , i wo n't allow rolled stats above that , and i 'd allow a player to reroll if they 're below that ( their choice ) . 
  the problem with point buy is it makes everyone so flat , so samey . 
  standard array is even worse . 
  everyone 's pretty good at one thing , pretty bad at one thing , and kinda average at everything else . 
  never getting below an 8 is dull , and i feel having one 18 to start , with rare characters having two 18s , makes for more exciting and interesting characters . 
  11:59:58 for me . 
  two seconds is a lot , easy to avoid doing it too late . 
  wife ? 
  i was assuming daughter . 
  he at the very least presents himself as though that 's what he wants to do . 
  sure , in reality his policies would immensely help those already wealthy and harm the poor . 
  but he comes across as though he * wants * to help . 
  more deluded than evil , as it were . 
   i wonder why her and her surrogates have shit on his support base the entire primary ? 
  because that 's how the primary system is set up . 
  if you do n't want that sort of thing happening , you need to try to get parties to elect their representatives in the same way leaders of parties in other countries ( particularly westminster system countries like canukaus ) are . 
  unfortunately , as long as your country uses first past the past as its voting system , you are objectively wrong in your belief there . 
  real men do it at 11:59:59.99, 
  i was missing brisbane went i went just as far as toowoomba last week . 
  and it had way more than your screenshot . 
  good luck bruh . 
  do n't really remember . 
  not a lot that was interesting . 
  mostly the same things i 've found in brissy . 
  hey , you 're not a bot !, 
  just change soo to superbowl for the american audience . 
  is g8 b8 when you 're baiting a gate , or the gate * is * the bait ? 
  wait , could you elaborate ? 
  currently if i grab a single gym , i can get 10 coins . 
  are you saying that grabbing a second gym would give me 20 coins , i.e. , i 'd have a total of 30 coins more than i started with ? 
  i 've had * all sorts * of problems with the app , but power save causing crashes has not been one of them . 
  i 've lately not been able to get power saver to * start * at all , but while it was working , it always opened back up perfectly . 
  i believe the game uses 30 km/h as the cutoff . 
   gen ii + pokemon, 
  i really hope they do n't do this . 
  personally , i 'd be okay with them doing up to gen iii , since i 'm relatively familiar with those personally . 
  but if they go beyond that , i 'll be lost . 
  and there are others , i 'm sure , for whom gen iii and even gen ii provide a similar problem . 
  keeping it with the gen i pok\u00e9mon means * everyone * is included , and nobody is getting alienated . 
  not to mention , with the fundamental model of the game encouraging getting a lot of the same pok\u00e9mon ( rather than matching people 's desires to `` catch 'em all '' ) , adding more pok\u00e9mon would make it even harder to get ahead , since you 'd be spreading yourself thinner . 
  tbh missions are one of the many features they 've added to ingress that i just never really got . 
  ingress was at its best , imo , when it was simple . 
  a few of the updates have been good , but i feel the game has lost its charm over all . 
   plus no friends list, 
  i could do without that , but the game is * seriously * suffering from a lack of sociability . 
  just a simple chat like ingress has , with local , regional , and global , both general chat and faction chat , would go a * long * way towards improving the game . 
  @mention people to give them a notification . 
  this sort of thing is n't a good end point , but it 's a great starting point for building communities . 
  from there , users can create google + groups and communicate through those and over hangouts , or other modes of communication that are superior to the in-game chat . 
  the internet is a wonderful thing . 
  can you not cash each one in separately ? 
  [ this list ] ( http://www.pokemongodb.net/2016/04/pokemon-go-types.html ) claims to describe where different types of pok\u00e9mon can be found . 
  whether or not it 's accurate , i do n't know . 
  however , if it is , it 's very general -- not as specific as `` desert pok\u00e9mon in deserts '' . 
  just which * type * ( as in the game mechanic `` type '' ) is found in what type of area . 
  yeah seriously . 
  one of the greatest qualities of classical music that sets it apart from modern popular music is the dynamic range from ^ ^ ^ * pianississimo * to ** forte-fortissimo ** !, 
  it makes it poor casual listening , and it makes it stand out a lot less over the radio ( where most music is in a competition to get louder and louder and grab your attention ) , but it also adds an enormous amount of depth . 
  the same applies to tempo . 
  you 're far more likely to notice a deliberate but subtle rubato in classical music than you are in modern popular musics . 
  sure , that 's fine . 
  but why point it out ? 
  we can all clearly see it . 
  your comment added nothing to the conversation . 
  it 's the purest form of downvote . 
  not downvoting because of disagreement , but because of irrelevance and inanity . 
  turn on your lights !, 
  or else the helicopters might run into the blimp !, 
  or something . 
  hey out of interest , did you get it working ? 
  just short ? 
  no , it 's * long * short . 
  my nexus 4 did n't get marshmallow . 
  the iphone 5 ( released in the same year ) is currently on ios 9 ( the chronological equivalent of marshmallow ) , and will be getting 10 ( equivalent to nougat ) . 
  i mean , i love nexus for so many reasons , and updates * are * one of them , being far better than any other android phone , but it 's still not as good as apple in that respect , unfortunately . 
  i 'd agree if they also did away with the hardware home button , and put the other buttons in the right order ( the back button is on the ** left ** gods damn it !, 
  and all of them look gorgeous . 
  and if you pay for that , you * also * get ads removed on youtube !, 
  which dslr and lens , if you do n't mind my asking ? 
  of course , the biggest advantage of a dslr is in photos where the subject * is n't * focussed to infinity , since you can get that really nice depth-of-field look that not even the best phone cameras can hope to get , due to their small sensors . 
  but wow , i 'm really impressed at how good the photos from the phones are these days , on wide shots at infinity !, 
  especially in such low light . 
  i 'm sure if you blew it up to monitor size the difference would be greater , but in the small thumbnails you posted , i ca n't really tell any quality difference . 
  if anything , i 'd say the nexus is * better * than the dslr !, 
   nexus phones are cheap for a reason, 
  nexus phones are * far * from cheap these days . 
  the 6p starts at $ 899 for 32 gb . 
  the 6s is $ 1079 for 16 gb . 
  sure , that 's a big price difference , but you 'd be pretty gods damned hard pressed to call $ 900 a * cheap * phone . 
  they used to be pretty cheap -- i got my nexus 4 for $ 420 -- but these days they are premium phones aimed at the same market as the apple or samsung flagships .
