  i think the nexus 4 is one of the best * looking * phones they 've ever made . 
   i 'm very happy to hear the news about the prime ministers stabbing [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaustralia/comments/4ted2l/emergency_press_release_office_of_the_prime/d5gn9is ), 
   the regrettable stabbing of our prime minister, 
  which is it ? 
  clearly you and your party condone , at least on some level , these sorts of horrendous actions . 
  you are disgusting trolls who have already been responsible for the destruction of one parliament , and now you seek to undermine another . 
  the people of australia should take a good hard look at themselves and ask : are these the sorts of people you want having a say in the running of your country ? 
  hi , please remember to flair your posts as appropriate . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is not really the place for tech support . 
  you may wish to try / r/cartography or / r/mapmaking , or possibly a more general image feedback subreddit . 
  slightly off topic , but was there no official unearthed arcana this month ? 
  i do n't recall seeing either a real ua * or * one of those half-baked homebrew `` reviews '' this time around ... 
  iruler does n't seem to work properly ... it 's detected me as 17.7 '' 1440x900 . 
  i 'm 15.4 '' . 
  where it said was 30 cm was actually only about 26 . 
  then , i manually specified the correct monitor size , and it went way too big . 
  now , 30 cm on a real ruler measures about 18.8 cm on theirs . 
  the player 's handbook contains all the answers to basic questions like this . 
  doubt it , they 'll just push external batteries . 
  i hope i 'm wrong though . 
  nexus 4 did n't get marshmallow . 
  it makes sense that the 5 would not get nougat . 
  if you were asking for artistic suggestions it would be more than welcome . 
  but you 're asking for technical help with using a tool . 
  our general response to that is to give it a few hours and see if it gets any responses , then remove it . 
  damn , no info on lens or settings makes it pretty difficult to fairly compare ... 
   to change the flag here , requires a majority of all the electors voting in the house of reps, 
  wow really ? 
  it does n't need to go through the senate ? 
  how come ? 
  usually on the first monday of the month , us time -- tends to come out in the morning . 
  very , very early tuesday for me here in australia, 
  they were a couple before , that 's correct . 
  as for what 's up right now , you 're not supposed to know yet . 
  just keep watching . 
   to the electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the house of representatives, 
  wait , so it 's done * kinda * like a referendum ? 
  but without the same double majority requirement ? 
  your former comment had me thinking it was voted on by the mps . 
  how do you curve ball with that ? 
  i 've a couple found squirtles and bulbasaurs , but not enough that i 'd say they `` pop up often enough '' . 
  where 've you found those ? 
  never seem a charmander either . 
  a game that looks like that should absolutely not be over $ 8 \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  it 's over two decades old , for gods ' sake !, 
  $ 8.09 australian . 
  point is , no game that 's over 20 years old should cost that much . 
  as a non-american , i 've frequently noticed that americans will introduce themselves , when asked where they are from , as being from their state , rather than saying america . 
  but if the metamagic option is disallowed , we do n't need the sorcerer levels . 
  thus , we can double the healing by taking two levels in fighter and using action surge instead . 
  nope . 
  that 's * only * true if you cast a spell as a * bonus action * . 
  two full actions , like that gained by the fighter 's action surge , can both be levelled spells . 
  but it does n't necessarily have to . 
  writers have been using different contexts as a way of bringing to light modern day issues for * centuries * . 
  sometimes that context is a different period in time ( see : the crucible ) , and sometimes it 's an entirely fictionalised/non-realistic setting . 
  but putting anachronistic elements in a story set in a different time period is the norm , and i see no reason to vilify it . 
  i ca n't speak to tarzan specifically , since i 've not seen it , but in the general case there 's nothing wrong with that kind of thing . 
  are n't they all fully evolved ? 
  lol . 
  you 've obviously never been to asia ... 
  your preferred technique also happens to be the law , so well done with that . 
  if the limit is 12 characters ( as suggested in the comment you replied to -- i have n't checked myself ) , all you could do is ` < script src = `, 
   but now that i no longer have input on sourcefed or any of the other channels, 
  from / r/defranco 's stickied post . 
  when did that happen ? 
  i 'll admit , i stopped following both the pds and sourcefed quite a while ago , but i occasionally watch the vloggity , and last time i saw that ( fairly recently , i think ) he seemed still to be involved . 
   knowing that you no longer have a 9th level spell ? 
  sorcerers can swap out one spell each time they level up . 
  so a level 17 sorcerer can actually know * two * 9th level spells , and can learn one more ( by forgetting a lower level spell ) each level from there . 
  wizards get 2 spells every level , so they can * easily * get more 9th level spells . 
  and also , obviously , they are able to copy spells that they find on scrolls or other wizards ' books into their book . 
  works for me . 
  wow that second site is absolutely amazing !, 
  how is it not against tos when others are ? 
  though its search is really crap . 
  typing `` university of queensland '' took me somewhere in johannesburg ... 
  here are some of the countries with a worse gross total government debt to gdp ratio than us ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt ) :, 
  * japan ( 238 % ), 
  * singapore ( 111 % ), 
  * spain, 
  * france, 
  * united kingdom ( 85 % ), 
  * germany, 
  * netherlands ( 72 % ), 
  * china ( 66 % ), 
  * brazil, 
  * finland ( 53 % ), 
  * india ( 41 % ), 
  * new zealand ( 38 % ), 
  * sweden, 
  it 's just a * few * of the more prominent countries . 
  we had , as of 2014 , 34 % . 
  doubtless it 's gotten worse since then , but it 's still clear that we are * not * doing bad . 
  anyone listening to the liberal party rhetoric about how we are in a debt crisis has been completely and utterly fooled . 
   i will mention though that the sites do n't pick up every spawn it seems . 
  there are clear missing spawns . 
  i 'm pretty sure the game itself misses some spawns . 
  i 've definitely had it pop up mons to catch that did n't appear in the bottom left scanner thing . 
  even better would be to keep the same url on his website pointing to the correct logos .
