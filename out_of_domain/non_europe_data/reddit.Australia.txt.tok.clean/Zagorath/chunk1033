  that way anything already linking to it ( including google ) should update . 
  false positive, 
  link ? 
  hnnnnggg , love me some radians !, 
  my rule of thumb : ** nothing ** that has not gone through a public review process can be considered balanced . 
  it does n't matter where it comes from , do n't trust it if the author did not put it on a forum where people can give feedback , and they took that feedback and made necessary changes . 
  for this reason , i generally do n't trust anything that has n't been posted to / r/unearthedarcana , because they have a strong culture of encouraging that type of feedback and making revisions -- a culture that all other forums i 've seen , including the dungeon master 's guild and of course dandwiki , have lacked . 
  / r/boh5e is even better , since feedback there is quantified by approved experienced reviewers , and things are only allowed in the first place if they 're considered to meet a certain threshold of quality . 
  so while a lot of stuff on / r/unearthedarcana might not be great ( since not every creator does listen to the feedback they 're given ) , * everything * on / r/boh5e is . 
   with a bias opinion, 
  i 've seen/heard a * lot * of people using `` bias '' in this way recently . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i 'm not blaming you specifically , since a lot of people do it , but it is incorrect . 
  `` bias '' is the noun . 
  you * have * bias . 
  the adjective -- the word you were looking for here -- is `` biased '' . 
  nevertheless , i agree with you . 
  there are two sides to every story . 
  throughout history , sure , perhaps . 
  but in the very , very early history of man -- pre-civilisation -- religion is widely believed to have been one important factor in allowing for cohesive groups to coalesce and the earliest civilisations to form . 
  the bot works by putting the exclamation mark * after * the `` remindme '' , not before it . 
  no , you `` just do n't get it '' . 
  the media and/or right wing commentators would call him a terrorist if he was muslim . 
  whether he actually is or not is irrelevant : in the eyes of the media , muslim = = terrorist . 
  that is the claim / u/buyingthething was making . 
  your rebuttal , while technically correct , is completely unnecessary , because everyone in this thread already knows the difference . 
  is google location reporting turned on ? 
  having your gps on is n't enough , google needs to have permission to use that information . 
  [ this page ] ( https://www.google.com.au/maps/timeline ) should show you where you 've been if it 's working . 
  i 'm not the one making the claim , only interpreting what the other guy said , since it was clear that / u/thegoldenkilometre was misunderstanding them . 
   but he did get it . 
  i explained why i thought he got it . 
  he 's just confused because it was actually sarcasm . 
  but it being sarcasm is the * bit * that he did n't get , and that 's the * core * of it . 
  he thought the comment was a genuine claim that if he 's muslim , he 's therefore a terrorist , which is neither true nor the argument being put forward by the person he responded to . 
  the person you responded to , mr buying , pointed out that it was sarcasm : that they were attempting to satirise right wing commentators . 
  your claim in response to that was, 
   the rhetoric behind the sarcasm ( as i understand it ) has been lost on you, 
  but there 's no evidence that i can see that this was the case . 
  i think all four of you actually agree on the points being made . 
  it 's just that goldenkilometre and you thought the other two ( or at least one of the other two ) were arguing the opposite of what they were . 
   no , what he is implying is the media determines terrorism based off muslim or white, 
  correct, 
   he 's stating this as if these two things are the same, 
  not correct . 
  he is ** not ** making that claim at all , and that is where you have gone wrong . 
  please do n't eat the possums . 
  they 're not very tasty . 
  well we can if you want to , but it does n't make you any more correct mate . 
  only if people are using it correctly , which they usually do n't . 
  also m means milli , m is mega , and yet people frequently misuse it . 
  correcting someone 's errors ( and rather politely , i might add ) is hardly `` being a dick '' , mate , but holy shit that must have taken a lot of effort to find . 
  you 're really quite dedicated to being an arsehole online , are n't you ? 
  i commend you for that . 
  please do n't recommend people listen to audiobooks while cycling . 
  that 's incredibly dangerous . 
  whether you 're sharing with pedestrians , cars , or only other cyclists , being in traffic with your ears at best distracted , but more likely partially sealed is going to make you less alert and less able to respond to unexpected circumstances . 
  hey , stop your victim blaming !, 
  the catch is you can only click that button once every 21 hours . 
  so you can grab one gym and click it , or take a gamble and after grabbing the first , go and try to claim one or two more before clicking it for a greater reward . 
  they could even sell a little hardware game pad thing to go along with it , so they 'd still be making money on both fronts , just a little less . 
  vertical video plus awful back lighting from the sun . 
  just ... * why * ? 
   you would probably think differently if it was a crime more close to home . 
  irrelevant . 
  there 's a reason victims are not on charge of sentencing or prosecuting . 
  victims would tend to want revenge , rather than justice . 
  they 'd frequently push for things we as a society have deemed inhumane and have outlawed for good reasons , such as the criminal 's death . 
  not seen the movie , but read the book . 
  i thought it was dumb , to be honest . 
  not a book that you can read into ( like my french teacher tried to get us to do ) , but just a simple dumb children 's book with a bunch of absurd events . 
  the clarinet needs to be blown into , but is unique in the respect that its lowest notes are as easy as ( or even easier than ) its middle register . 
  that 's one fun fact i like to share about my instrument of choice . 
  i just love beethoven . 
  he 's my favourite composer by far . 
  his odd symphonies ( except his 1st , but including his 6th ) are all among my top favourite pieces , and many of his piano sonatas are among my favourites as well . 
  in addition to the obvious stuff , i really like his orchestration and harmony . 
  my favourite examples to point to are the bassoon countermelody in the recapitulation of the a theme in the 1st movement of his 5th symphony , and the oboe 's long notes that it plays just * after * its little solo . 
  beautiful subtle moments that beethoven is just so great at doing . 
  australian here : is it les-ter ? 
  personally , i played a `` ranger '' in a one-shot that was actually an assassin rogue 3 | ( dex ) fighter 2 . 
  depending on the * type * of ranger you 're after , i think that type of multiclass is actually a better way of achieving it both mechanically and thematically than the actual core ranger class . 
  i was more interested in being an ithilien ranger type thing than the type of ranger the class itself aims to be . 
  i took the fighter level first for the armour and weapon proficiencies : in particular i wanted the option of using heavy armour on occasion , even if that would n't be the normal thing -- just like faramir from lotr . 
   `` common sense darkness '' ( because i wanted to stop people picking elves , and only elves ), 
  but * most * races have darkvision ... dwarves , elves , gnomes , half-elves , half-orcs , and tieflings from core , as well as fire genasi and eladrin from other non-ua material . 
   while out of combat a player may attempt to `` knock out '' a target using a non-lethal attack, 
  i use a fairly similar set of rules , although not for knocking out , but for `` coups de gr\u00e2ces '' . 
  the rule we use is a little more vague . 
  the first bullet point is the same , but the second and third essentially become `` if the dm thinks it makes sense '' . 
  to try and be more specific , it needs to appear to be a mostly humanoid type shaped or have an obvious exposed point that would realistically lead to immediate death if attacked ( like a neck ) . 
  like yours , it has to be out of combat : in combat , you ca n't do it because at the same time as attacking them , you 're having to defend yourself from other enemies as well , so standard combat rules ( advantage + auto-crit ) apply . 
   what do you consider generic ? 
  what 's the benefits of this rule ? 
  pretty much anyone who 's not running a campaign with heavy survival elements probably does this or something similar to it already . 
  from the sounds of things , it 's just not keeping track of ammo except for magical or silvered ammo . 
  on paper , i would probably rate this about +7 on the homebrew race balance guide . 
  that 's quite strong , but acceptable . 
  however , i think it actually is overpowered . 
  the guide does n't account for how certain traits interact , and in this case , i think having so many damage resistances is what puts it over the top .
