  i understand why you would do it that way , but it is still too powerful . 
  i 'd also suggest the increased flexibility to ** duelistic heritage ** is too powerful , by being able to choose * either * of those spells . 
  i think it would be better to keep the damage resistances from * one * of the races , and get the spell from the opposite one to balance it out . 
  personally , i think for flavour reasons keeping the tiefling 's fire damage resistance and the aasimar 's spell at level 5 would be better . 
  the reverse would work for balance in my opinion , but would feel less interesting/logical to me in its flavour . 
  from a stylistic standpoint , i think you should try and find some artwork you can use . 
  it 'll certainly be difficult for this , but having nothing at all makes for a dull read . 
  you should also note that race names are not capitalised . 
  tiefling , aasimar , and aasling should all be written lower case , unless they start a sentence . 
  `` consimate '' is a typo/spelling error . 
  you presumably meant `` consummate '' . 
  however , `` consummate a child '' does n't really work grammatically in this case . 
  the way it would usually be used is `` to consummate their relationship by having a child '' . 
  anyway , this is a cool race i think . 
  the name throws me off a little ( tieflimar or tiefimar might be a little ... cleaner ) , but other than that i really like the overall idea . 
  just needs a little rebalancing and a second look over the written text . 
   to rebalance , i 'd suggest : pick one type of damage resistance , & get either light or thaumaturgy as a cantrip, 
  that would probably be too weak . 
  one damage resistance ( if it 's fire -- two if it 's necrotic and radiant ) plus the standard cantrip and two spells progression is fine in terms of balance ( as long as the increased flexibility by being able to choose from * two * spells at 5th level is removed ) . 
  that 's the exact way the existing tiefling and aasimar races work . 
  i 'd suggest making sure you are very familiar with all the phb/dmg races and the [ homebrew race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) , and making sure to refer to those when giving feedback on homebrew races . 
  you 've done a pretty good job here for the most part , but your suggestions would be a nerf * too far * , when compared to the existing races upon which this one is based . 
  you 're certainly right that as it is now , it 's overpowered , though . 
  i do n't know about britain , but in australia skipping means both of the above . 
  sad ? 
  it sounded to me like he was playing the [ shepherd 's song from beethoven 's pastoral symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em8rlczp0kq ) . 
  it 's an incredibly happy and optimistic tune !, 
  hmm ... i 'd say that it 's tentatively okay like that . 
  the normal spell progression is a cantrip and 1st level , a spell and 3rd level , and another spell at 5th level . 
  you 've removed the 5th level spell , and substituted it with a fairly rare damage resistance . 
  balance wise , i 'd say it 's okay . 
  however i 'm fairly tentative with that , and i 'd highly suggest listening to what other experienced reviewers have to say on the matter . 
  i 'm surprised nobody has mentioned this already . 
  it will obviously vary from setting to setting , but in the forgotten realms , dragonborn are actually * very much * *** not *** religious . 
  they were enslaved by dragon overlords on abeir , and then when they were able to cross over into toril ( the prime material plane ) , they took it as an opportunity to not have to serve anyone against their will , and that includes gods . 
  not that individual dragonborn ca n't be/aren ' t religious , but in general they are not . 
  i 'm currently sitting on $ 11 in australia . 
  i 'd have more , but i 've already used some of it to buy the premium version of reddit is fun . 
  what you 've described there is also freemium , but it 's a particular subset of freemium that many would describe as `` pay to win '' . 
  freemium does not have to be a negative thing , and i think pogo is a game that does it fairly well . 
  ( not perfect , but fairly well . 
  personally i do think lucky eggs push it a * little * too far into the p2w camp . ), 
  i first became a mod on a subreddit that i really liked the content of , but i could tell that without direction ( the mod who created it had no interest in running it ) , it was going to die off . 
  so i started posting one good bit of content per day , mentioning it in related subreddits whenever it was relevant ( while trying to avoid spamming ) , and asked the creator to add me as a mod so i could mess with the css and stuff . 
  it paid off , because the subreddit is closing in on 30,000 subscribers and has been a featured trending subreddit a few times . 
  nah , it 's like a [ middy ( also known as a half-pint , a pot , or , if you 're exceptionally weird , a schooner ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gnay7c3.jpg ) , but smaller . 
  having originated in google , niantic are heavy users of google + . 
  that 's probably the best social media method of contacting them . 
  [ yes it is , and here 's proof ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle_stalker ) . 
  oh , and there i was thinking you were referring to how the other world powers reacted to germany just prior to wwii . 
  yeah for sure . 
  i do n't think i 'd recommend it for a standard shooter , but i used a trackpad in portal and portal 2 , and it worked fantastically . 
  i remapped the gun buttons to q and e rather than clicking , but for the actual precision control it was easily good enough . 
  i could never say the same thing about any other touchpad . 
  one alternative , proposed by the pirate party ( at least the one in australia ) , is much shorter patent durations in software , to reflect the much faster-paced technological environment in software compared to other industries . 
  let software patents last for 5 years , rather than 20 . 
  the rate at which technology changes , 5 years is still way more than the equivalent of 20 years in other industries . 
  creators can get a very good use out of their patents , then eventually ( but before the technology is so old it 's completely irrelevant ) it can get used by everyone . 
  you 've popped some of the text into the third column , which means it is n't displaying properly . 
  you should move the feature after `` duelistic resistance '' onto the next page ( or , even better , move the whole of `` neutral lenience '' into the next page ) . 
  what size exactly would you want ? 
  the paper goldsmith is using looks to be roughly a3 , which is super easy to get your hands on at any office supplies store . 
  if you wanted to go really big , you could get a2 or even a1 , but those may be a little harder to come by . 
  just an fyi , the symbol you should have used to get across your point is '' \u21d2 '' . 
  you could do =  for an easier way to type it . 
  though the choice of symbol does n't make the statement any less bigoted . 
  that would be a valid argument iff violence from one branch of islam to another was the only concern . 
  but it clearly is n't , since most of the terrorist attacks that make the news here are from a muslim to a predominantly non-muslim area . 
  just shy of 10 % of indonesians are christian -- far more than there are muslims in australia ( or germany , for that matter ) . 
  another ~ 2.5 % are something other than muslim or christian . 
  so no , not really homogenous . 
  uhh ... i do n't agree with the guy at all , but i have to defend him this time . 
  he did n't say it * was * long winded , he asked for a post that was long winded * next time * . 
  the implication being that had twoverend 's comment been longer , the point he was making might have been clearer . 
  some of us are , sure . 
  but have you ever been to / r/atheism ? 
  i do n't know what it 's like today , but back when it was a default subreddit it was pretty damn awful . 
  just a side note , anyone interested in homebrew should be very familiar with all the existing material first , since it can provide inspiration and help understand how to balance things . 
  this includes the core ( phb/mm/dmg ) , but also includes the unearthed arcana articles that wizards of the coast releases . 
  ua articles are particularly great , because many of them include design notes and ideas for * how * to go about creating homebrew . 
  the term `` ribbon '' is one that we 've come to use thanks to [ one of these ua articles ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_waterborne_v3.pdf ) . 
  in general , these design notes are often more valuable than the actual content of the articles . 
  hear hear !, 
  i do n't think i 'd call proficiencies `` ribbon effects '' , since they have a very definitive mechanical effect -- especially skills . 
  but i do agree that it 's a poor design . 
  it makes for a fairly awkward solution to a problem , and one that 's likely not to work very well in most cases anyway . 
  everything you wrote really seems to have hit the nail on the head . 
  more int class options , in particular , would really help . 
  is * probably * doing that . 
  it * could * be using good back end practices , but adding in weird requirements like that for other reasons ( either legacy reasons -- maybe they * used * to store in plaintext and no longer do , but did n't update the rules -- or other more bizarre reasons , like wanting to decrease customer support by subtly encouraging weaker passwords ) . 
  is cheyanne pronounced shy-anne ? 
  i 'll be honest , if i saw that in writing in any other context , i probably would have pronounced it chey-anne , like `` chase '' without the `` s '' . 
   the things i miss from 4e are too structurally buried to bring back easily, 
  i 'm curious , what are they ? 
  parts of it are , especially bits of winter and spring . 
  but play them the second movement of summer and i bet most people would not recognise it . 
   if they can check what characters are in your password , they 're seeing it in clear text, 
  only if they can check it * after * account creation/password generation . 
  they can do a check before accepting the request to create an account or change the password . 
  if it passes the check , they should then salt and hash , and store the result of that .
