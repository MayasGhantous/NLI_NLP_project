  if it fails , they send an error message to the user . 
  if we 're getting rid of teen titans go , could we get young justice back please ? 
  touch\u00e9 . 
   at that point you make it easier for hackers to figure out your hashing / salting schemes, 
  that really should n't matter . 
  the whole point of salting/hashing ( and indeed most modern security measures ) is that the algorithm can be completely publicly known and that this does not impede security in any way . 
  in general it 's just best practice not to perform any logic client side , * especially * not anything that could be in any way related to security , since it exposes more potential vulnerabilities . 
  in this case , it would mean an attacker could send the hash directly to the server , rather than needing to find a value that hashes to the same value as the password under the same salt . 
  the salt wo n't be known though , since it would still have to be sent over the network to the user on a case-by-case basis . 
  hear , hear !, 
  ( side note , was the op in that thread 3fun ? ), 
  same living in vietnam . 
  the most common crimes tourists and expats typically experience are non-violent ( or at least not intentionally violent ) . 
  they 'll drive past on a motorbike and rip women 's handbags away , which can sometimes be painful , depending on how they 're holding it , or can even knock them down and do some damage that way , but i do n't think i 've ever heard of someone i know ( or someone that someone i know knows ) being mugged at knife-point or similar . 
  nope . 
  taxi drivers are , but bus drivers are far more likely to be white in brisbane . 
  sure , but the study was conducted in brisbane ... 
  carry on . 
  also the name of an absolutely fantastic play . 
  they said you could do that , but the form to do that refused to work for me . 
  i really did have to go and buy a new adult go card . 
  the battery has finally completely shit itself in the last few months , but it lasted all the way until then . 
  i 've been noticing its slowness for about half a year . 
  other than that , it 's still a very functional phone . 
  probably gon na replace it with the new nexus when they come out . 
  copyright is technically automatically conveyed when you create a creative work . 
  people register their works with the copyright office because it 's one of the strongest ways to prove the true ownership of a work in the case of a dispute . 
  patents and trademarks work differently . 
  there is such a thing as a de facto trademark , but they 're far weaker legally than even an unregistered copyright . 
  patents are * entirely * about when they get registered . 
  but that does n't really matter , since patents and trademarks are both completely unrelated to homebrew . 
  not really . 
  put your signature on your work so even if someone takes it wholesale it will still track back to you , but there 's not much else you can do , unless you 're willing to spend money to try to enforce it . 
  and maybe in your opinion that 's worth it , but personally for homebrew that 's being put up for free anyway , i 'd say it very rarely is . 
  yes , it 's a very real philosophical conundrum that comes with artificial intelligence . 
  it 's * unlikely * to occur since they can process information much more quickly than a human , and may be more likely to detect signs of it long before a human could anyway -- and if the entire road was made up of self-driving cars that communicate with one another in real time , it 'd be damn near impossible to occur -- but imagine one of those drivers coming up the wrong way , and your only options are to swerve into a pedestrian , swerve into oncoming traffic that 's driving * legally * in their lane , or have a head-on collision with the fuckwit . 
  in that scenario , or similar ones , what 's the right action to take ? 
  what are the penalties for some of the more serious offences seen here ? 
  i do n't know if they are , but they should ** really ** include a lifetime ban from driving . 
  fuckwits like that should just not be given a second chance to put themselves and others in danger . 
  someone above suggested that the driver may not have seen the pedestrian , possibly because the beam holding up their windscreen was in that spot . 
  that would be , in my opinion , the * only * excuse for them acting how they did . 
  because you 're right , if they saw them ( and failing the beam being in the way , they * should * have noticed them earlier ) , acting how they did was dangerous . 
  i 'm not sure about this . 
  lake eyre was discovered ( for europeans ) and named after edward john eyre , an englishman . 
  that 's not how the phrase `` aka '' is used . 
  it 's online . 
  it 's [ `` gesh '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geis ) , but the g is a `` voiced palatal stop '' , rather than the more common ( in english ) `` voiced velar stop '' . 
  it 's actually kinda somewhere between a `` g '' and a `` j '' , kinda . 
  basically , when you pay for things with ether , it can automatically run a script to do things . 
  not so good if you need to ship a physical product , but can be useful for automated services . 
  dark cloud . 
  i played it once when i was really young , got to the final boss , and was never able to beat it . 
  then when i was a little older i played it again from the beginning . 
  i got to the dark genie again , and had fully completed the rest of the game this time ( last time around , one of the zones was slightly not completed ) . 
  but again , despite repeated tries , i could never beat the dark genie . 
  i have n't played that game in about a decade , but it still feels like the one that got away . 
  some day i 'll go back to it and finish it . 
  the first boss was dran , i think ? 
  the big wing\u00e9d beast . 
  ingress had the same problem in its early days . 
  and it still does , to some extent ; it * should * be easier to take over a gym/portal than to defend one , because that makes for more fluid gameplay and allows players to feel like they 're being useful . 
  however , over time , extra things were added in ingress to make defending possible . 
  most prominently were portal shields and other mods , as well as a buff to defence per link . 
  i 'm sure some similar updates would be possible for this game too , but niantic would be smart to be careful with it , because going too far the other way is far , far worse than keeping the status quo . 
  also good ( can/should be combined with the above tip ) : play ingress ; pok\u00e9mon go might also be good for the exploration aspect of this . 
  you 'll have to go around to new areas to find portals to hack , and you 'll need to join the community in order to be successful , which means meeting locals . 
  if you 're in the right lane and you 're getting tailgated ( and you 're not overtaking ) , there are two arseholes . 
  you , since you should only be in the right lane if you 're overtaking someone ( it 's not a matter of fast/slow : it 's overtaking , or not ) , and the arsehole tailgating you , because there is ** never ** a good reason to be tailgating . 
  if you 're in the left lane and being tailgated , they are the only arses involved . 
  they are putting their own lives , and ( more importantly ) the lives of countless other people at risk . 
  their * lives * . 
  you 're already required to prove that you are * capable * of driving correctly to get a license . 
  clearly these fuckwits are able to do it . 
  they just choose not to . 
  it 's not ruining their lives by taking away their ability to endanger the lives of other people . 
  they can walk , ride a bike , or catch public transport . 
  any of those would be removing or substantially minimising the number of * other * people that could be in danger . 
  it 's not dmca . 
  youtube 's copyright process does far more than what would be required by the dmca . 
  personally i think one thing that they should do is allow you to actually * defend * the gym by * controlling * the pok\u00e9mon in it , if you 're within range . 
  that would go a long way , but would still allow rather fluid gameplay , since defenders would have to be physically at the location . 
  adding some sort of equivalent to shields -- maybe giving defending pok\u00e9mon berries to auto-heal or something -- would also work . 
  so , what exactly happened with the ethereum fork ? 
  i do n't follow the community at all , just had to work with ethereum for a university course one semester . 
  regarding medusas , my personal favourite story of how one could be used [ is this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cc629/the _ medusa / ) . 
  the tl ; dr ( warning : spoilers ) is that it played off of players ' expectations that it was an evil medusa , a character that everyone knows , and instead revealed at the end that it was a tragic character that had never intended to hurt anyone innocent . 
  you can use your players ' expectations to your advantage like that . 
  do something that they are n't expecting , whether that involves changing the mechanics or just having it behave in a way very different from expected . 
   writing ` bag of flour ' on any character sheet , ever, 
  please explain ? 
  picture hunting ? 
  hey , just so you know , reddit does n't allow link shorteners , so this was automatically spam filtered . 
  i 've manually approved it this time , but in the future please always link directly to the source . 
  the problem with your race table , as i see it , is that it does n't preserve demographics . 
  instead , you end up with races that have the most subraces being the most common , which is rather bizarre , especially in the case of the genasi . 
  [ here 's my random race table ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m38-n7l1a5xtmzar_qppfen0dtiycib_1ywkxo6j6bi/edit?usp=sharing ) , which includes all existing races that i 'm aware of , but also includes different sized chances biased towards the more common races . 
  it 's biased * slightly * in favour of the rarer races compared to how i personally would imagine the world would be , but that 's to do two things :, 
  acknowledge that these rarer races are disproportionately likely to become adventurers , due to social outcasting . 
  make the rarer races more likely to come up , because they 're fun to play .
