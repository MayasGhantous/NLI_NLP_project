  for convenience , below is the main race table . 
  the spreadsheet also has separate tables for choosing subraces of each race that has them . 
  ( edit : except for dragonborn and genasi , which i figured are probably exactly equal , so can be easily rolled without needing a special table for it . ), 
  percentage chance | race | roll, 
  25 | human | 1 -- 25, 
  13 | elf | 26 -- 38, 
  8 | half-elf | 52 -- 59, 
  4 | half-orc | 60 -- 63, 
  5 | dragonborn | 84 -- 88, 
  3 | goliath | 98 -- 100, 
  did you see the [ variant rules ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua5_variantrules.pdf ) ua ? 
  or , assuming you play in a medieval fantasy setting , the two that have been focussed on modern settings ? 
  i actually thought the array bit was the best bit of it . 
  or at least , the idea of it . 
  one of the biggest advantages of rolling for stats is that it encourages more varied stats . 
  whereas people who point buy or use the standard array will generally have the same `` curve '' to their stats , as it were . 
  i tend to force rerolls on too strong or too weak characters , which decreases the randomness somewhat , but maintains a mostly equal power level , but using these arrays you get an * exactly * equal power level \\* , but still get the varied curve . 
  and it 's super , super quick . 
  a single quick die roll is nearly as quick as using the standard array . 
  much quicker than point buy or rolling [ 4d6 \\ 1 ] \u00d7 6 . 
  \\* unfortunately , their table creates values that are unobtainable via point buy , and thus a direct power comparison is difficult . 
  but the * idea * is there . 
  make up 6 different options for point buy , ranging from 15 , 15 , 15 , 8 , 8 , 8 to 12 , 12 , 12 , 12 , 12 , 12 ( or whatever it is -- i did n't actually do the maths here ) , and roll on those . 
  you 'd get the best of point buy , and most of the benefits of rolling . 
  personally i could n't give a fuck about al , but i do like the idea of being able to easily compare the stats from this to point buy . 
  so here 's my table , based on their idea :, 
  d6 | ability score array, 
  i have n't double checked these , but they * should * all be point buy legal . 
  1 is the steepest curve , 6 is the flattest , and 4 is the standard array . 
  i do n't know what that is , but it looks like one of those spammy advertising landing pages you get from domain squatters . 
  no thanks . 
   why are these things so hard , when they should be so simple ? 
  murica, 
  the heading should be a level 2 heading , not level 1 . 
  level 1 in homebrewery is for people who want to create a whole new * chapter * , not just a single class/race/etc . 
  chapters start with giant drop caps , individual classes should not . 
  can the 15 levels be spread out among those three races ? 
  why only those three ? 
  why ca n't warlocks , clerics ( they can be evil too !, 
  ) , or druids ( the idea of an evil druid that goes too far and becomes a lich could be cool ) become liches ? 
   very few * beings * \\* have access to this knowledge, 
  that 's as far as i can go right now , but i love the idea and will get back to the rest of it as soon as i can . 
  hmm , i 'm still lost . 
  are you sure you 're not talking about the second game , dark chronicle ? 
  i do n't remember any pictures or barrel in the original . 
  i never played the second one . 
  hear , hear !, 
  anyone know why star trek is trending ? 
  the movie 's been out for almost a week now , and the new show is n't until next year . 
  was there some announcement regarding said show ? 
  love the fact that / r/continuityporn ( on account of trekkies ' obsession with continuity and canon ) and / r/beautifulsemicolons ( from its description ) are trending on the same day , though . 
  okay , i 'm back . 
  the spell slots thing as it 's written is just bad . 
  do n't do it that way . 
  look at the [ rune magic ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) prestige class , or singular 's [ vampire ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlcvnhtk1wu1u1ztq/view ) prc , for how to put the proper spellcasting progression into a prestige class . 
  note both the `` runic magic '' and `` vampiric arcana '' sections in the body , * as well as * having spell slots given in the class progression table . 
  the way spells known and prepared is written is similarly bad . 
  it needs to be completely rewritten , because currently it does n't really make much sense , is poor grammatically , and does not conform to 5e style guides . 
  resistance to necrotic and immunity to poison feel a little too strong for a one-level dip . 
  it 's not a * huge * deal , since the minimum level is so high , but maybe the first level could only convey resistance to poison , and grant immunity at level 2 . 
   instead of any of the normal * effects * \\* you trap the target in your phylactery, 
   i chose to make phylactery a 2nd level feature , even though they are a basic part of liches , because it requires imprisonment * -- * a 9th level spell . 
   also * , * if a player completely neglects their phylactery ( probably when they would normally die from the levels of exhaustion ) they would , according to lore , be transformed into a demilich * . 
  i * n this instance * , * it is the dm 's call on exactly what happens to the character . 
  spells should always be written non-capitalised and in italics . 
  the exception to this * might * be ( i actually do n't know ) those spells which include a proper noun , like * tasha 's hideous laughter * , where the proper noun should be capitalised . 
  * paralysing touch * should be either formatted in such a way as it could feasibly be used as a cantrip for * any * player ( including scaling appropriately from low levels ) or , more likely , should be worded as a class feature , not a cantrip . 
  a 4th level that * does n't * get an asi is ... highly unusual , at best . 
  lich 's lair is pretty cool , but * extremely * situational . 
  it * might * not be terrible to gain an asi in addition . 
  armour of undeath is great . 
  it functions as a capstone ability , so really being overpowered is n't too much of a concern . 
  oh and by the way , we have a flair for prestige classes . 
  i 've automatically set it to the correct one this time , but in the future please try and use the correct one . 
  it is legendary rarity , so being very powerful is kinda the point . 
  dmg says players should n't get these until they 're level 17 anyway . 
   using the rune mage progression where they 'd end up with full slots but no 9th level spells is a bit odd, 
  no that bit is fine . 
  it 's just the bit describing the spell * slots * which is really poorly worded . 
  the mechanics of it are perfectly okay , it 's just how everything surrounding spellcasting in this class is * worded * that 's the problem . 
  ca n't take it off ? 
  can freeze you to death ? 
  this sounds like a *** curse *** d item . 
  which is totally fine , curses are cool !, 
  and in this case , the curse is a rather easy one to avoid -- as long as you 're willing to do the bidding of stallos . 
  but you should probably word it accordingly , and add an explicit '' *** curse . 
  *** '' section in . 
  everyone knows cats love to sit on computer monitors . 
  ( wait , it 's still 2002 , right ? ), 
  star trek beyond . 
  it 's the third movie in the jj abrams alternate/reboot timeline . 
  came out on the 21st . 
  i ca n't tell you anything about it though i 'm afraid . 
  i have n't seen it yet . 
  they would handle it exactly how they currently do if you pay for more storage , use it , then stop paying . 
  i do n't know whether it is or not , but the op of the / r/videos thread has posted in / r/brisbane before , and posted in / r/pics with photos that are from brisbane . 
  i 'm confused . 
  what is that place ? 
  you 've got a major formatting issue that makes it impossible to read . 
  what browser are you using ?
