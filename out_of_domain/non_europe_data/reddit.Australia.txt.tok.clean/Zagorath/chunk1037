  firefox performs ... poorly ( to put it politely ) with the homebrewery . 
  there are options in the monster manual for each of these , but they are * bad * . 
  they 're designed to be used either to create npcs/bad guys , or used as temporary curses that players will be rid of quickly . 
  they 're far too powerful to give to players properly . 
  if you ( as a dm ) or your dm ( for your players ) allow it , [ this homebrew vampire prestige class ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlcvnhtk1wu1u1ztq/view ) is one of the best bits of homebrew that has been created for 5e . 
  [ here are its reviews on the best of hombrew subreddit ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) , and [ here is the feedback from the last update on / r/unearthedarcana ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) . 
  it really is a fantastic option . 
  well balanced , allows * progression * at the expense of class levels , and * strongly * reinforces the flavour . 
  unfortunately , i have n't seen something of the same quality for lycanthropes . 
  slightly different , since it 's a teleport . 
  could get somewhere you ca n't get by moving , like over a small cliff or up onto a balcony . 
  i 'd be interested to see it , if only to check if it 's perhaps one i 've seen before and/or to find the related / r/unearthedarcana thread , if there is one . 
  is this website publicly available per chance ? 
  talk about the game in / r/dndnext , create and review homebrew on / r/unearthedarcana , work on worldbuilding .

  if you want to notify people , you need to link them with / u/username . 
  it wo n't work if you try to link to a subreddit with the same name as the user . 
  ( as a side note , you can only notify a maximum of three people per comment . 
  if you try to do more , it will ignore them all . ), 
  but anyway , i 've seen the updated version and have already updated my review accordingly . 
  yeah pretty much . 
  it 's a placeholder in case we ever decide that the amount of need for the arcana forge is high enough to spin off into its own subreddit . 
  ( currently , it 's well suited to being just a stickied biweekly thread in / r/unearthedarcana . ), 
  if you click on the [ google docs link it the above comment ( or click right here ) ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m38-n7l1a5xtmzar_qppfen0dtiycib_1ywkxo6j6bi/edit?usp=sharing ) , you can get all the subraces that are officially released ( i.e. , not ua ) , except genasi and dragonborn , by clicking on the separate tabs at the bottom . 
  the lack of genasi and dragonborn is simply because i would judge those to be exactly equal weighting , so you could just roll a d4 or d10 and assign one number to each subtype . 
  i have n't yet done ua races , but i would definitely consider it . 
  i 'm a lot more open to using those now than i was when i first created the above table , since at the time even though i liked the idea , i wanted to try out 5e with just the completely official stuff . 
  what is there in ua ? 
  the alternate tieflings and the minotaur are the only ones that immediately come to mind . 
  this is a really , really , really damn awesome gif . 
  the looping is fantastic . 
  but it is in no way `` sly '' . 
  from the sidebar :, 
  ** sly . 
  ** this means either something has to be going wrong in the gif , or the subject of the gif appears to be doing one thing but instead does another . 
  i saw one attempt at porting that ( or at least , it was an attempt at creating a full class vampire ) . 
  imo it was quite overpowered , especially at higher levels . 
  i can try and dig it up again if you 're interested . 
  however , one thing many have done ( though imo only one has done it well ) is use the template wizards gave us for prestige classes when they released the runic mage , and created a * prestige class * that is meant to represent a progression in the player 's vampiric powers . 
  [ you can see the best one here ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlcvnhtk1wu1u1ztq/view ) . 
  in my opinion , it 's not just the best vampire homebrew , it 's in the top three or four pieces of homebrew * anyone * has made for * any * aspect of d&d 5e . 
  people may also find [ this comparison of ua to other related subreddits interesting ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/unearthedarcana#compare=dndnext+dndgreentext ) . 
  personally i find the `` subscriber growth '' tab to be a little too busy and confusing to read , but the `` total subscribers '' tab provides a good comparison . 
  oh damn , i forgot all about the eberron races !, 
  where are the alts for half-elves ? 
  i do n't recall that one ... 
  personally i would be leaving out the zendicar races because i find the idea of merging a trading card game with a roleplaying one utterly bizarre , and because those races are n't made by the d&d team , but by the magic team . 
  if unearthed arcana is a step between official and homebrew , the zendicar stuff * is * homebrew , just by people who happen to work for the same parent company that makes the official stuff . 
  it 's both . 
  they pick the subreddits * based * on a larger sample of subreddits given to them by some algorithm . 
  though i do n't think they 've announced exactly what metrics their algorithm is using . 
  page views , posts , and/or increased subscribers , i would assume . 
  we need / r/enoughpoliticsspam to be a thing . 
  ah yes , of course !, 
  thanks . 
  posts not written in the greentext format do n't need to be formatted like that , but this is clearly written intending to be greentext . 
  is that not an argument against smaller or independent professional realtors as much as , if not more than an individual selling their own place ( since both would be tricky to escalate , but at least with a non-professional you can expect a bit more in the way of morals ) ? 
   there was no way you could remember every last candidate . 
  i worked out my preferences the night before and printed it out . 
  i voted above the line , but remembering the order of 13 ( i think ) parties would have been impossible . 
  as i said to my sister when she made a similar comment : it 's not a test !, 
  there 'd be no reason for them to restrict what you can bring * in * . 
  first of all , as i explained in my previous comment , driving really is * not * all that essential to livelihood . 
  there are many alternatives . 
  second of all , no , i have never made a mistake that would seriously put others ' lives at risk , like some of the more serious offences shown in this video would do . 
  nobody is suggesting the penalty should be that harsh for going 10 k over the limit , but some of the most heinous offences , lives should be worth more than one dick head 's convenience . 
  one of the best we 've had imo . 
  reposting it for those that are new is fine . 
  but this is a good chance to plug our [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which contains a selection of the best stories that have ever been posted here , including this one from the last time it was posted . 
  or maybe just do n't write stories about them . 
  except when they 're hilariously bad and their badness becomes a good story in its own right . 
  since there are quite a few , i 'll just suggest some of my personal favourites . 
  [ sir bearington ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179ea/sir _ bearington / ) is very short and really well known , for a pretty good reason . 
  [ the medusa ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cc629/the _ medusa / ) and [ an evil necromancer ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ) are great stories for what some might call `` the feels '' . 
  among the longer stories , [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) is * really , really * long . 
  i 'd suggest reading only a few of the entries at a time , and reading the whole thing over the course of a couple of days . 
  but it is * definitely * worth it . 
  it 's an incredible story . 
  [ the mechanic ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 217h1w/star _ wars_tabletop_the_mechanic / ) is hard to sell without spoilers , but it 's another really great one . 
  slightly on the long side , but easy enough to consume in one sitting . 
  all the stories in the hall of fame are great , but if you only read a handful , those would be my recommendation . 
  when even the channel 9 commentators are siding with the broncos , you * know * it 's a shit decision . 
  tbh bad decisions piss me off when i 'm watching neutral games as well . 
  it 's only when the other team suffers for them in a game the team i support is playing that i laugh at bad calls . 
  it was a bad call , but i think some other calls in the last couple of weeks ( both last round and origin 3 ) were worse . 
  i think the bunker is a way better * idea * . 
  they just need someone who 's not a moron to run it . 
  being able to hire a single `` expert '' to run all the games instead of a bunch of separate guys for each game * should * make for better results . 
  plus i like the fact that the audience now gets to hear exactly what they 're thinking when they make a decision . 
  was the pass * called * forward by the touch judge and then overruled by the video ref ? 
  because that is the * only * way that what you 're claiming makes sense , but it 's also not really what you 're * saying * per se . 
  sorry , but i have removed this post . 
  this subreddit is for sharing rpg-related stories . 
  you might want to try / r/dnd and / r/dungeonsanddragons . 
  hey sorry but i 've removed this , since it 's throwing up a security certificate warning . 
  if it 's meant to be linking to a text post , you might be best off simply copying the text here . 
  if it 's something else , you should try linking directly to it without using a link shortener . 
  thanks .
