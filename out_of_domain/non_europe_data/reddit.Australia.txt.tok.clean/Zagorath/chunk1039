  i can use it on my laptop , my desktop , my phone , my friend 's computer , computers at uni , and public computers ( the latter three via the web interface ) . 
  the lack of a web interface is what absolutely * kills * anything other than lastpass in terms of being a viable solution for most people . 
  if you ca n't always get at your passwords , a password manager has lost its utility . 
  you 're right that there 's a theoretical risk associated with it . 
  but as you said at the end , if you have a good password ( and since you 're using a password manager , and thus only need to remember a single password now , it really * can * be very strong -- mine personally is over 20 characters long ) , the risk is so minimal that the massive increase in convenience lastpass offers is worth it . 
  is that a fancy way of saying `` dead end '' or `` no through road '' ? 
  true , but i feel making that mistake would be far less severe than a bonus action turning into a reaction . 
  oh yeah , that 's a brilliant idea . 
  we should just completely eliminate the ** one ** * good * , unbiased , news source in the country . 
  ca n't believe no one thought to do it earlier . 
  the catch is that a rogue will not natively have * proficiency * with longbows . 
  that means no adding proficiency bonus to the to-hit roll . 
  that 'll result in him missing a lot more than he would otherwise . 
  to negate this , he 'll need longbow proficiency somehow . 
  elves get it . 
  could also take a 1 level dip into fighter or get the weapon master feat . 
  sneak attack is n't directly related , but it would be a massive nerf to his character if he was n't proficient , so one of the above would be very useful . 
  really for this sort of question , / r/dndnext is the best place to go . 
  it 's the biggest system specific community , and most of the people are pretty nice there . 
  they even have a dedicated weekly megathread for basic questions like this . 
  hey sorry , but i 've removed this post . 
  this sub is for 5e and system agnostic material only . 
  i would agree with the speaker that we should make sure that becoming a republic is per se a fantastic step forward and beyond our colonial past . 
  it is absurd that the current head of state is an old woman who lives quite close to the literal opposite side of the world . 
  a woman who could not give a rat 's arse about this country and has not even set foot here in nearly 5 years . 
  that is no person to have as a head of state . 
  i would further agree that the role of the new head of state should be identical to that of the current governor general . 
  they should have the same powers , and be expected to abide by the same conventions . 
  it is in pursuit of this latter clause that i must disagree with the honourable general . 
  i believe that using the name `` president '' would cause a shift in the way people think about the role , and may make people more accepting of a far more involved head of state than we currently enjoy . 
  it would both remove the existing precedent in the minds of australians , and would * bring with it * the baggage carried by the term `` president '' in countries such as the united states , where the president is a highly political and active figure . 
  another key part of avoiding the removal of hundreds of years of precedent ( thanks to the conventions brought over from westminster ) is to continue to have the selection of this role be a largely ceremonial matter . 
  the person put forward should never be a political play , and most importantly of all they should not be directly elected . 
  a directly elected head of state brings with them a mandate to use their ( theoretically quite considerable ) powers in pursuit of that mandate , which history has shown us is something we really do not want . 
  their powers are important , but should not be used except when absolutely necessary . 
  the precise nature of the appointment of the head of state is not something i 'm overly concerned about , so long as it is not a direct election and can not easily be made overly political . 
  replaceable battery is an overrated feature . 
  they can make substantially bigger batteries by not using up the space to allow the mechanism to have it removed , and if you 're carrying around a thing to get more battery , an external charger is even better than a second battery , since it ( a ) does n't require you to restart your phone , and ( b ) will usually have way more capacity than a second battery . 
  it also limits the ability to make cosmetically pleasing designed phones . 
  the sd slot thing is unfortunate . 
  probably just google being google and trying to encourage more use of cloud services . 
  for some of us , the data required to do that is too much , so more permanent storage that does n't cost an arm and a leg ( like upgrading the internal storage always does ) would be really nice to have . 
  yes , i would suggest we keep governor-general . 
  it would keep our entire history of convention as to how they should use their powers . 
  changing the name * at all * would break that . 
  ( `` president '' just makes the problem even worse by * adding * the conventions of the us president , in people 's minds . ), 
  the governor-general ( or whatever new head of state title we go with ) , if their powers remain the same as they currently are , has * considerable * theoretical power . 
  they do n't use it by convention , but they do have it . 
  to me , the risk of changing that convention so that they are more willing to use it is too great . 
  the [ political compass ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) refers to this as `` left authoritarian '' . 
  it has historically been the rarest of the four quadrants , but it has been interesting to watch it grow with the growth of xenophobia around the western world lately . 
  i have no idea what the greens htv card looked like . 
  i made up my own mind on how to vote . 
  i suspect most greens voters probably do the same . 
  you have to be more engaged in politics than the average person to vote green in the first place , after all . 
  is the aspley one still open ? 
  i definitely remember seeing it last year . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i agree with you , except for one small exception to your first sentence : rbts . 
  doing something to dissuade drunk driving is worth the two minutes it takes out of your day to blow into the machine . 
  serious question on a tangential topic , what is the law on `` jaywalking '' in the states ? 
  is it actually that bad ? 
  i 've noticed a lot of people here in australia * think * it 's illegal , but at least in my state , the actual law is that you ca n't cross a road * within 20 m of a marked crossing * unless you are actually on that crossing , and the walk sign is green ( if it 's an intersection with traffic lights ) . 
  crossing when you 're further than 20 m from a marked crossing is completely fine . 
  yes it is . 
  rbts are like speed cameras ( ones that * are n't * placed at the bottom of a hill or other sneaky places purely to raise revenue ) : an important part of keeping the roads safe for everyone . 
  especially if they 're done late at night or early in the morning after a night where drinking is common , they 're a perfectly reasonable way to keep the roads safe for everyone without majorly inconveniencing people . 
  i do n't know whether your conclusion is correct or not , but your reasoning is way , way out . 
  the fact that they use your work to check against plagiarism by others has ** no ** bearing whatsoever on who owns the copyright to that work . 
  it means no one can * plagiarise * the work , but that is completely unrelated to copyright . 
  it could be that this user is referring to a piece their created in one of the group 6 subjects , for example , and they want to sell it or have it performed/displayed publicly . 
  * if * ( and again , i have no idea whether it is true or not ) the ibo owns the copyright on that work , this would be a copyright violation . 
  to use tok terms ( because hey , one rarely gets the chance to use them -- apart from the logical fallacies -- after ib !, 
  ) , you either have a true belief or an untrue belief , but you definitely do not have a justified true belief . 
  sure , you 're right on that . 
  they do n't need that knowledge . 
  but the rbt is completely fine . 
   it is illegal search and seizure in my book, 
  luckily , you 're not a federal judge , so your opinion on the legality or lack thereof is irrelevant . 
  edit : as for their effectiveness , here 's the first thing that came up for me when i searched for it :, 
  it certainly claims that they were effective . 
  in fact , at least the first five results that i got were in favour . 
  so there goes that theory of yours . 
  exactly !, 
  rbts are completely okay . 
  the people claiming otherwise just do n't make any sense . 
  nobody is * detaining * you . 
  you 're being held up for two minutes to breath into a bag to verify it . 
  it is completely reasonable . 
  whenever one is talking about a particular emoji , one should * always * reference emojipedia . 
  [ here is what the nepal flag looks like on every major operating system or device ] ( http://emojipedia.org/flag-for-nepal/ ) . 
  it 's important not to rely on what sounds logical , and to actually look at the evidence . 
  it is not uncommon for something that sounds logical , like this does , to actually turn out to be false . 
  however , in this case , the evidence quite clearly shows that speed cameras * do * reduce speeding . 
  / u/zoltrahn quite clearly was talking out of their arse when claiming otherwise . 
  but i believe it 's quite a common myth that speed cameras are ineffectual , so any downvotes may be from people who choose to ignore the evidence and keep believing the myth . 
  it probably does n't help that i 'm one of a small number of rational voices elsewhere in this thread , speaking out against the insane notion that rbts are immoral . 
  it 's like this thread is mostly made up of the subjects of / r/amibeingdetained , it 's that level of idiocy going on here ... 
  so , a couple of things . 
  the first and most important is that there was actually a rules clarification quite recently that no , druids are not shapechangers for the purposes of the mechanic `` shapechanger '' .
