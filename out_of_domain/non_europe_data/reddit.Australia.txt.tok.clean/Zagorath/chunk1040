  for that , you 're looking at creatures like the doppleganger , which have '' ( shapechanger ) '' in their type description . 
  the second is that the * polymorph * description actually says, 
   an unwilling creature must make a wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect . 
  a shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw . 
  thus , if you want to use * polymorph * on an ally , you can -- so long as they let you . 
  even if druids were considered shapechangers , it would n't matter . 
  the only time it * would * matter is if you wanted to use it on an enemy -- say , to turn them into a rat and cage them for an hour . 
  in that case , enemy druids would be able to automatically avoid it ( if you decide that druids should count as shapechangers ) . 
  one thing i 'll say i found interesting in reading your description , the link to the answer , and googling the phrase myself , was that it has such strong negative connotations . 
  i had never thought of it in that way . 
  i would have used it as a fairly neutral term , just meaning that someone is trying to get on someone else 's good side -- no connotations of brown nosing or anything like that . 
  yeah i definitely think the average podcast ca n't and probably should n't be done that way . 
  it 's an inherently fleeting medium compared to scripted television and movies -- much more like radio , really . 
  you certainly can put out content that stands the test of time and is suited to binging ( bingeing ? ), 
  -- i listened to the ~ 450 episodes of the security now !, 
  podcast that were out when i first started it -- but for the most part , i tend to start a podcast where they 're at when i found it , and go from there . 
  people do n't tend to go and binge watch the backlog of sports programming or news reports . 
  useful for videos , but for an off-the-cuff thing like a podcast , not always feasible . 
  sounds to me like such people need a rubber duck more than another person . 
  i 've lately seen the clickbait really , really heavy in pop culture style videos . 
  i 'm currently seeing things like, 
  * 10 famous people who killed their careers in seconds, 
  * top 10 objects that were clearly invented just to annoy physicists, 
  * 17 mistakes of zootopia you did n't notice, 
  i do n't think i ever see videos that i 'd describe as `` vlogs '' recommended to me . 
  to be honest , politics have just gone crazy worldwide lately . 
  you 've got the uk and us things going on that have been discussed in the podcast . 
  australia has had 5 prime ministerships this decade so far , and another one or two are likely before it 's out . 
  russia 's acting as though it 's still in the cold war , hong kong 's decided to defeat the entire point of democracy by disallowing candidates from running , and i 'm sure there are plenty more examples that could be found with some effort . 
  that 's not the rule . 
  the rule is and always has been no casting a second levelled spell if you cast one as a * bonus action * . 
  two full action spells are completely acceptable through this , but also through a multiclass with fighter to get action surge . 
  not just the spell list , but the number of spell slots . 
  it says nothing about the spells * not * costing a spell slot . 
  so in effect it 's something you can only use once per short rest ( although it does n't explicitly state this -- could be * very * powerful for multiclasses ) as a warlock , * and * it 's going to use up most of your resources until your next short rest . 
  in 5e , good design requires most things to be balanced without negatives . 
  min-maxing by being really powerful at something , but gaining a negative elsewhere , is bad design . 
  small mostly flavourful exceptions are fine ( like the drow in sunlight ) , but one should not try to use strong mechanical disadvantages to offset strong mechanical advantages . 
  silly , everyone knows that lawful is referring to telling the truth , respecting authority , and honouring tradition . 
  it 's the opposite of chaotic , which means you follow your own conscience and resent being told what to do .

  the best easy option is probably [ the homebrewery ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ ) which uses a syntax very similar to reddit 's markdown . 
  and i would certainly recommend you do , since more people are likely to read something that looks nicer . 
  it really depends on what your area is like . 
  all the gyms in my area are constantly filled with crazy high level pok\u00e9mon . 
  it 's just impossible to get in . 
  would have been better * for turnbull * . 
  not necessarily the more moral option , but would have played out better for him politically . 
  uh , do you mean this ? 
  30th august `` parliament resumes '', 
  i do n't think the bot will pick it up if you edit your comment . 
  another option would be to upload it to google drive . 
  drive can convert both word documents and pages documents into its own format , and you can edit those in the browser , or download them in a wide variety of formats . 
  depending of the use case , either this or the op could be more useful . 
  the suits ... 
  primarily transmitted by a particular species of mosquito . 
  they 're really repelling that mosquito . 
  we wo n't review paid content because we want people who * read * the reviews to be able to get it . 
  there is so much great stuff that people are already putting out for free , it would be a disservice to the community to spend time reviewing stuff that only a select few people who are willing to pay for stuff can even possibly see . 
  that 's because only critics * can * actually post . 
  anyone can submit their own homebrew via modmail ( and most of the stuff that is submitted is * not * from an established critic ) , but it will only be posted if the critics agree it meets a minimum threshold , because it 's a curated subreddit meant to only show la cr\u00eame de la cr\u00eame of homebrew . 
  anyone is free to leave comments , however . 
  for reference to those reading this , that 's on / r/boh5e . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is a free for all ( though it does have a strong culture of feedback and iteration , and badly balanced stuff where the creator is n't interested in improving it tends to get downvoted ) . 
  i * think * the shortcut you 're looking for is `` q '' , but i 'm not 100 % sure what it is you want to do . 
  if `` q '' does n't do it , could you post a picture from a score of what you want to do ? 
  i would n't say i like it , but i have done it , once . 
  i do n't own a ps3 ( or 4 ) , so i could n't play the last of us . 
  instead , i watched a playthrough of it . 
  one where the player did n't make a sound , and edited it to be like a movie , so they did n't repeat the same area over and over and over again . 
  it was great . 
  i 'm sure playing it myself would have been better , but as a movie it still worked fantastically . 
  in the general sense , i do n't get it . 
  especially when the player is talking over it , i just do n't understand the appeal . 
  not exactly . 
  / r/unearthedarcana requires that submissions at least * appear * complete . 
  that is , they 're fleshed out and full of content . 
  but it does n't require balance to be good , or flavour text to be fleshed out , or formatting to be top notch . 
  we also allow even less complete stuff , like soliciting feedback on vague ideas and classes where half the levels do n't have features yet , to be submitted in a bi-weekly pinned megathread called `` the arcana forge '' . 
  [ here is the latest one ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  1 ) [ yes it does ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) , and [ some of the best homebrew ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) things have been prestige classes . 
  2 ) racial templates are bad design . 
  they make for decent villains and temporary curses , but player options need to be balanced . 
  the best way to do this in many cases is a prestige class . 
  3 ) as long as the flavour is there and the balance progresses nicely ( i do n't know whether this does or not yet , i have n't looked at it -- i 'm responding to your comment on the principles , not the practicalities of this particular example ) , the simple fact that it 's based on a well known bbeg is n't a problem per se . 
  hey , i 've re-flaired this as `` resource '' . 
  meta is for discussing the nature of the subreddit itself . 
  as a side note , normally we would remove posts like this , but the fact that it provides a tip for how to export pdfs ( and the fact that it * suggests * users do this , which is a great idea ) is sufficient that this time , i 'm going to leave it up . 
  i have yet to see any general rule for large races that feels balanced in the way that small races tend to be okay . 
  it 's just much harder to balance against , especially since races in general provide small bonuses in a fair few areas , rather than big bonuses in a small number of areas . 
  this is very well done mechanically . 
  a * fantastic * improvement over the previous version . 
  there are no glaring fundamental mechanical issues with it that i can see . 
  the only small mechanical thing i 'm not entirely sure about is immunity to poison . 
  it is , admittedly , a very high level and a fairly rare damage type , so it 's not a * huge * deal , but it still feels a little too powerful . 
  i feel like it should be resistance , and then get immunity with the capstone , along with the other abilities . 
  there are just a few grammatical/wording things that are worth fixing . 
  in all cases below , if you 're unsure what the difference is , look closely at punctuation , or click `` view source '' on reddit and see the bits that are surrounded by asterisks . 
  ### throughout, 
  generally , classes ( and races , for that matter ) do not capitalise their own name , except at the beginning of a sentence .
