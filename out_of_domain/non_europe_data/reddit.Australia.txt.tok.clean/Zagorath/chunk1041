  i 'm not very familiar with liches , but i do n't know of any reason that they would be an exception . 
  unless you * know * that there is a particular reason that `` lich '' would be capitalised when `` bard '' and `` wizard '' are not , avoid capitalising `` lich '' throughout . 
  ditto any time you mention another class ( like `` wizard '' ) -- do n't capitalise it . 
  the one except to this is when referring specifically to the class table , i.e. , saying `` the lich table '' . 
  ### in the introduction :, 
   some wizard * s * and other spellcaster * s * seek arcane power, 
   in this search for power * , * they, 
   they * then * continue their quest, 
   from beyond the grave * , * as a shadow, 
  ### in the prerequisites, 
   you must meet the following prerequisites ( in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class ) :, 
  ( i.e. , use the text from the runic mage verbatim ), 
   you must find the ritual * that * transforms you, 
   this knowledge * ; * the few that do, 
  ### in lichdom, 
   as a lich * , * you are an undead creature and you gain, 
   within a phylactery * -- * a box filled with, 
   you must then * perform * a 7 hour ritual on this box which * includes *, 
   you must cast * imprisonment *, 
  ( i.e. , remove the `` the '' ), 
   at least once * every * 4 weeks, 
  but anyway , all of that is mostly just minor nitpicking . 
  this is really well done in my opinion , overall . 
  easy enough to untick them though . 
  i 'm more annoyed at the way the fields had their description * inside * the field * only * , and you had to backspace away the whole thing before you could enter your own details . 
  if you make a mistake and remove them all before typing them , and forget the correct order , you have to refresh the page to see them again ... 
   i personally strongly dislike mlp, 
  i find this a weird reaction to have , to be honest . 
  like , do you have some strong philosophical problem with the show or something ? 
  as far as i can tell it seems like a pretty normal kid 's show with a decent message behind it . 
  it 's not something like avatar or young justice that can be equally great for kids and adults , but is there anything particularly * wrong * with the show ? 
  to me , it 's a show like any little kid 's show . 
  i do n't honestly feel very strongly one way or another about it . 
   this is pretty much cannon, 
  [ so , this ?

  i have n't read it entirely so i do n't know for sure , but i believe the privacy act 1988 may allow what the other user was describing . 
  specifically clause 6.2 . 
  bitcoin works using `` blockchain '' technology . 
  to provide a massively oversimplified explanation , basically every transaction is put into a long chain of transactions . 
  normally they 'd be a single line . 
  a `` fork '' in that chain is something that normally should n't happen , but if it did there would be two valid paths in bitcoin . 
  two separate blocks in the chain would connect to the same one , and from there they never join up again . 
  it would essentially be two * separate * currencies with the same name and a common history . 
  as for why they 're doing it , i have no idea . 
  i do n't really know anything about the bitcoin community , i just studied the basic technology in a uni course one semester . 
  email headers can be spoofed . 
  if someone was going to a lot of effort to fake something , spoofing the email headers would be one of the easier steps . 
  not that i know whether anything is legit or not . 
  i 've been in this subreddit for all of three minutes . 
  just that , * theoretically * , seeing the header does n't provide an awful lot more proof than anything you already had . 
  alignment has n't been holding back the game since 2008 . 
  it 's there now as a purely descriptive element , except for a very small number of rather obscure elements of the game , like physically visiting the hells , or fighting a rakshasa . 
  other than that , all it 's doing is giving a brief shorthand way of * describing * the general way a character will behave , not forcing anyone to do anything in particular . 
  no idea . 
  i literally know nothing about why they are forking it or what difference there will be between the two forks . 
  you 'd best ask the folks at / r/btcfork , or some other forum for bitcoin enthusiasts , if you want more specific details about this case . 
  it did , but it 's come back . 
  unfortunately , it 's a shadow of its former self ( much like the pirate bay , in that respect ) . 
  the problem with this definition is that it means some iterations of the joker are lawful ; notably , the nolan joker very explicitly said that his ideology was to be unexpected and keep his opponents on edge . 
  his ideology was to be chaotic . 
  a better way to define the difference between `` law '' and `` chaos '' is whether the person respects society and order or not . 
  a lawful character , for example , will be hesitant to lie ( lg will typically be openly honest , while le characters will be more precise with their wording , so that it 's technically correct even if it 's misleading or leaves out important information ) , but a chaotic character will have no problem telling a lie to further their cause . 
  a lawful character will typically try to work within the structures of whatever hierarchy is locally in place , while a chaotic one treats it with disdain . 
  alignment by definition can not be restrictive , because it is ( since 4e ) merely a way of * describing * how a character acts . 
  you look at the character 's actions and beliefs , and from that you can determine its alignment . 
  the 3.5 mm will be utterly useless to you . 
  the mechanics of 5e are far , far too different ( the biggest problem is `` bounded accuracy '' ) to use . 
  the starter set is a great way to get started in 5e . 
  it contains a physical copy of the basic rules and a * really * great starter adventure called lost mines of phandelver . 
  ah right . 
  i misread your previous comment . 
  yes then , i think something like that could be possible . 
  i would probably start with the existing goliath and then add and remove features to keep the balance mostly the same . 
  i do n't think i 'd go faster than 35 ft , just to give a little more wiggle room in terms of balance for other features . 
  [ this is a good rough guide of how to balance homebrew races ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  it is only rough , though , so do n't take it as gospel . 
  most importantly , it can not factor in how different abilities synergise , so you 'll need to consider that yourself . 
  but , that 's kind of the point . 
  it 's a really specific ideology , it 's just that his ideology is a very fundamentally chaotic one . 
  that 's why using `` having an ideology '' as the sole defining trait of law is a poor one . 
  having it represent order and structure is a far better method , but even that still fails to some extent . 
  really the terms are quite nebulous and i do n't think any single definition can pin it down . 
  i 'm a little worried about how powerful misdirection would be , especially as a 3rd level ability . 
  it 's almost like an automatic advantage roughly at least 50 % of the time . 
  comparing it to assassinate it looks * almost strictly * better . 
  but i 'd be interested to hear what others have to say about that . 
  the swashbuckler 's toujours l'audace provides what i think is a pretty good model to work on , it may be worth considering something similar . 
  duelist sense is great . 
  quick mind , quick body is a good feature on its own , but when combined with the current `` misdirection '' ability , the two features of a single archetype are now competing for the rogue 's cunning action , along with the basic class options for its use . 
  that feels pretty problematic to me . 
  i love press the advantage . 
  in terms of wording , it 's nearly perfect . 
  you just need to stop capitalising `` finesse '' . 
  check the sneak attack entry in the phb , and you 'll see that it actually is n't meant to be capitalised . 
  i also wish the artwork were a little nicer . 
  the picture itself is absolutely sublime , but it 's just kinda stuck on there . 
  a version with the background transparent and maybe a shadow added in would * really * make it `` pop '' . 
  ( some colour would also really help . ), 
  also , yay lefties !,
