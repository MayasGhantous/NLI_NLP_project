  allowing sneak attack actually fits * right * in line with the way toujours l'audace works , which is pretty nice . 
  while that gives it * automatically * , but only in a 1-on-1 situation , this one requires success on the check and takes a bonus action , but it can also be used on any opponent you want . 
  a reasonable trade off , in my opinion . 
  so , this is something i 'm really glad to see . 
  the biggest thing i did n't like about 5e when i first saw it was how dull it is to play a non-caster . 
  `` i hit it with my stick '' is pretty much every round of combat for at least 4 classes , and is a common theme of a few more . 
  lame . 
  so many other things have sold me on the edition overall , but i 'm still not happy with how lame fighting without features is . 
  but i 'm a little worried about this . 
  it does n't even seem to * try * to be balanced . 
  everything about it is * strictly better * than normal attacks , since it involves making a normal attack and also adding other things on top of it . 
  by the way , since it 's on the homebrewery , you can ( and i would suggest * should * ) edit in the rules for how exactly these work . 
  the stuff from your comment down below , but also some flavour information about what exactly these are and how to use them . 
  yup , same here . 
  i dunno which one though , so the way you 've worded it is exactly the same way i would ( as opposed to others who have put marlin and sailfish in their preferred order ) . 
  i just really hope the recent rumour that it wo n't be out until october is wrong ... my damn n4 is on its absolute last legs . 
  yeah , that 's correct . 
  so this version would come in to play in two possible cases :, 
  * when there are two enemies within range of you . 
  * when you have an ally directly behind you ( and thus not adjacent to the enemy , to provide the free sneak attack ) . 
  now , maybe those two cases are too rare to justify requiring both a check and a bonus action . 
  in fact , they probably are . 
  especially since in the former case , you 're way more likely to want to use it to disengage and get to safety . 
  so maybe it should * only * be the check , and can be done as part of the normal attack , no bonus action ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  are they the store that was opposite the games workshop ? 
  if so , yeah , shut down unfortunately . 
  part of me wants it to be like the runic mage from the ua , just to give prestige classes a little more legitimacy as a concept ( because they are a really great concept if used well ) . 
  but another part of me thinks that a rune mage * is n't * quite the right place to use a prestige class , and so forcing it into that format would be a disservice both to runic magic and to the case for prcs in 5e . 
  apparently it 's a northern european thing . 
  i 'll check more closely next time i 'm driving , but i 'm fairly confident that at least on the exit to a motorway , this is n't true in australia . 
  i pretty clearly remember seeing a 60 sign * only * on the left a short way down the exit , and thinking `` huh , this must be to make sure drivers still on the motorway do n't somehow get confused and think it could be for them '' ( since a sign on the right of the exit would also be near enough to a sign on the left for the motorway ) . 
  yeah because i 've approved it manually . 
  i do n't know if you 're aware of how urls work , but that link was to the domain media.wizards.com , which means it comes from wizards of the coast . 
  further , also in the url was '' ... / dnd/ua ... '' , indicating it is part of dnd , and that the file is associated with unearthed arcana . 
  i agree . 
  that could be useful , especially because it would provide a place to * explicitly * state ( though it 's already implicit in the slight difference in wording ) that your spellcasting level for the purposes of picking spells as part of this class is the total of your other caster * and * your levels in lich . 
  it 's a difference from normal spellcaster multiclassing that 's worth making clearer . 
  you just responded to a comment that says they do n't mesh * mechanically * well by describing a whole bunch of * flavour * reasons that they could work well together ... 
  rif actually shows the url you 're about to click on in a little pop up before it takes you to the site . 
  really useful for deciding whether it 's worth actually going there or not . 
  this certainly is a legitimate question , and i 'd be interested to see what more people have to say about it , but i 'm afraid i have to remove it . 
  unfortunately , it does go against the subreddit rules . 
  specifically , post requirement 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  if you were to resubmit this [ in the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) , it would make for a very interesting discussion , i think . 
  you could also try in / r/dndnext , though they tend to be a bit negative towards homebrew , so you may not get the best results . 
  well uh ... not yay that the abc shop shut down , it was awesome , but yay that gametraders is still around . 
  i had heard that ncis and csi were in a sort of competition to be the most ridiculous . 
  like you though , i do n't know of a source for that . 
  vign\u00e8re is an interesting cypher to try and crack , because it 's * very * vulnerable to a `` known plaintext '' attack . 
  that is , one where you know ( or can guess ) what some of the correct text might be . 
  in this case , for example , take `` kilor , '' . 
  5 letters and then a comma , at the * very * beginning of a text ? 
  `` hello , '' seems likely . 
  then you work backwards from there and you can guess that the key must start with `` deadd '' . 
  from there , you can try and see if the key is just `` dead '' ( since `` deaddead '' would also result in the first letters being `` deadd '' ) , but that quickly does not work . 
  then , what other words could start with `` deadd '' ? 
  other things you can do to look for known plaintext include looking for single - , two - , or three-letter words and trying common possibilities . 
  / r/postprocessing : `` by using programs such as ... * apple aperture * '', 
  ouch , way to rub in the salt , guys . 
  `` liars and charlatans '' . 
  careful now , that 's * exactly * what devils * are not * . 
  one of my favourite quotes from the d&d novels i 've read is from a cambion , and he said `` i did n't lie . 
  i was n't forthcoming ; there 's a difference . '', 
  what makes devils great is how they will act to the letter of their word , but not necessarily the spirit . 
  if they say they will do something , they will do exactly that , but they 'll interpret it in the way that is most convenient or beneficial for them . 
  it 's actually quite literally _ impossible _ for a full-blooded devil to explicitly _ lie _ , to the extent that a cambion who has lived their whole lives in the hells can be completely surprised and sickened ( in much the same way zuko became sick in avatar , when he started doing good ) when they _ do _ tell a lie . 
  that is explicitly true in the forgotten realms , but may not apply to all worlds , though personally it 's what i love about them , so i 'd recommend dms run them that way in any world . 
  but this was otherwise an absolutely fantastic video . 
  the stuff about going in to negotiations with a devil with extreme caution was spot on . 
  much like davis , devils are one of my personal favourite villains , and apart from a couple of offhanded mentions of them lying , this video explained all the things that i like about them pretty succinctly .

  personally , i think the first little bit of lost mines of phandelver makes a pretty good one-shot . 
  it should be possible to go from neverwinter to phandalin and have it take about the right amount of time for a single session , if they stop and go through the goblin cave . 
  it 's also good because it means they have another campaign they can immediately lean in to if they want . 
  it 's one per household not per person , so 25 million is going to go down quite a lot . 
  plus you can do it offline by requesting a paper form ahead of time , so that will drop the number down a little . 
  the final factor is time of day . 
  i do n't actually know what time you 're supposed to fill it out , if there is one . 
  but if it 's all day , then the load will be spread out , probably with the heaviest concentrations in the afternoon when people get home , and the evening after dinner . 
  but even so , yes , the load will be very heavy . 
  it 's quite likely that they 'll experience technical issues , and i suspect that if they do they 'll just have to let people off the hook for not filling it out . 
  they ca n't and wo n't fine people for not filling out the census if it 's because the website did n't work . 
  i was hoping that would pay off somehow though , and it did n't .
