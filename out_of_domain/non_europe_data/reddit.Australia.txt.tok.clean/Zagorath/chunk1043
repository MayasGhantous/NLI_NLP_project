  that whole thing was completely dropped a short way in to the movie ... 
  i 've felt similarly about every movie in the dc cinematic universe so far , to be honest . 
  i * really * liked the way nonlinear narrative was used in batman begins and the nolan trilogy , but i feel like the way this universe has used them from the beginning has been appalling . 
  flashbacks were used all throughout ^ ( bat ) man of steel and it really , * really * did n't work . 
  it was a little better in bvs , but still was n't great . 
  and then in this film it just felt awkward . 
  to be fair , though they said that a couple of times , they never came close to expounding upon it or giving an example to that effect . 
  i kinda figure they were just going for dramatic effect with that line , and tried to summarise the devils ' penchant for omitting important information and presenting misleading ( but technically true ) information by saying they are `` liars '' . 
  a little unfortunate , but it did n't detract from the rest of the video . 
  unfortunately , the movie * was n't * very good . 
  much like the other films in the dc cinematic universe , it completely misses key points of what makes its characters who they are . 
  the fact that they removed this scene is particularly poignant , because it shows that they might actually have been really close to getting it right this time . 
  but instead they turn it into a two-sided loving relationship . 
  it was a definite step up from the previous two films in the universe , but still fell short of the mark , unfortunately . 
  you think the ga ( i assume that means general audience ? ), 
  did n't hate bvs ? 
  i do n't know who you were talking to , but basically everyone i know who saw it was at * best * underwhelmed . 
  granted , my friends are mostly at least passingly interested in comic book characters . 
  it 's conceivable that people who do n't know very much or care very much about these characters might have enjoyed it regardless , but if you 're making a movie about comic book characters and are n't pleasing the people that * care about comic book characters * , you 're doing it wrong . 
  the best way to start understanding vigen\u00e8re is to understand the caesar cypher . 
  caesar is the absolute simplest cypher you can get , it 's a simple matter of rotating every letter a certain number of places . 
  a caesar cypher with a key of 1 means `` a '' becomes `` b '' , `` b '' becomes `` c '' , `` z '' becomes `` a '' , etc. 
  caesar 2 means `` a '' becomes `` c '' , `` z '' -  `` b '' . 
  to decode , you go in the opposite direction . 
  `` b '' becomes `` a '' if the key is 1 , and `` a '' becomes `` z '' . 
  interestingly , there 's a particular type of caesar cypher that 's known as rot13 . 
  it 's when the key is 13 , and it means encoding and decoding are the same . 
  but that 's not important to understanding vigen\u00e8re . 
  the vigen\u00e8re cypher takes the basic caesar cypher , and it uses a * different * key on each letter . 
  this is done by having a key word , and the word represents a series of numbers to plug in to the caesar cypher . 
  `` a '' is worth 0 , `` b '' is worth 1 , `` c '' is worth 2 , and so on . 
  what you do is you line up the key with the plaintext ( the text that you want to encrypt ) , and you repeat the key over and over again . 
  the cyphertext becomes the result of rotating each letter in the plaintext the correct number of places matching the letter of the key that aligns with it . 
  the message `` hello '' , with a key of `` deaddrop '' becomes `` kilor '' , since the `` h '' gets rotated 3 places ( d is worth 3 ) , the `` e '' is rotated 4 places , etc. 
  to go backwards , align the cyphertext with the suspected key , and rotate * backwards * the appropriate amount of places . 
  if we have `` kilor '' and we think the key is `` deaddrop '' , `` k '' goes * back * 3 places and becomes `` h '' , etc. 
  there are a few different ways of attacking a vigen\u00e8re . 
  one is the one i described above , but another works mainly if the key is fairly short and the plainttext is quite long . 
  you look for words in the cyphertext that are the same . 
  * chances are * that this means they were the same word in the plaintext too , and that it just happened that the same part of the key aligned with them . 
  from that , you can look at the gap between the two times this word appeared , and then you know that the * length * of the key must be a factor of that distance . 
  so if the gap was 20 characters , you would then know the key must be 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , or 20 characters long . 
  since the key is normally an english word ( or a word in the language you suspect the plaintext to be ) , and normally not two long or too short ( you can rule out 1 , 2 , and 20 quite easily ) , that narrows down the possible keys substantially . 
  the way to prevent this , if you were trying to encrypt something yourself , is to use a slightly different cypher , called a one time pad . 
  in this , instead of having a key * word * , you have a really long string of random letters . 
  you and the person you 're communicating with would have the same sheet . 
  then you use this sheet as your key . 
  the string of characters on this sheet should be long enough that it does n't require you to loop back to the beginning . 
  to be extra secure , the same pad should not be used twice . 
  to identify a cypher is a little harder . 
  there are two basic types of hand-decryptable codes . 
  one is substitution cyphers , which is all the ones discussed above , and any others that involve substituting one letter for another through some means . 
  the * order * of the plaintext is never altered . 
  the best way to identify these is to analyse the frequency at which each letter appears . 
  substitution cyphers will cause the frequency to no longer match the usual frequency of the language ( `` e '' being very common in english , as well as `` s '' , etc. , and `` z '' being very rare ) . 
  the other is transposition cyphers . 
  these are usually identifiable by being written up in columns of text , rather than just writing out the text however comes naturally . 
  this involves moving the letters around , but keeping all the same letters . 
  some sort of key relates to how the different columns are shifted , generally , depending on the exact type of transposition cypher . 
  another way to identify them is if the frequencies * do * match those of the language . 
  on what board ? 
  this subreddit ? 
  i 'm not surprised that that would be the case . 
  most of the people subscribed to a subreddit dedicated to the dccu are bound to be the types of people who enjoy the direction they are heading in . 
  while rakshasas are from the hells , no , they are not devils proper , so they wo n't necessarily exhibit all the same features that devils do . 
  they may have some things in common , though . 
  no always , no . 
  the obvious except to point to is / r/arrow , which is an almost hilarious overreaction to the declining quality of that show . 
  but certainly , looking at this subreddit myself , it 's got a very strong positive vibe to it compared to the critics online ( and the critics i follow are generally much smaller ones , not the stereotypical professional critic ) and compared to people i 've talked to in real life . 
  to me , that says that it is this subreddit that is out of touch with how people actually view the movies , because everywhere * else * i look i see lukewarm reactions at best , but this place is really happy with not only ss , but bvs and mos as well ( relatively speaking ) . 
   the heli scene joker push her, 
  that was in the movie , though ... it was n't an abusive thing , he seemed to do it to save her from it crashing . 
  personally i do n't know or care very much about the marvel comic characters , so i 'm a lot easier to please with those movies than i am with dc . 
  especially since dc has had such a fantastic run of animated shows in the past , and even its current live action line up is ( mostly ) really good . 
  they already have committed to allowing events and their consequences to cross over from the films to the shows . 
  it 's the other way around that some people would like to see . 
  yeah . 
  to be honest , i thought quinn was actually portrayed pretty well in this film . 
  the actor 's accent ( something i was really annoyed with in the trailers ) was predictably poor ( slipping in and out of something * approximating * the ny accent she 's known for ) , but everything else was pretty good with how she was done . 
  it 's just unfortunate that this joker seems to be genuinely in love with harley . 
  i definitely understand why they would have avoided it , but after all the comments they 've made in the past about how they prefer gritty realism in their universe ( even when it * is n't * warranted ... ) , it 's kinda disappointing they did n't stick to their guns this time . 
  i 'm partial to summer , because of the unusual interpretation it has of the season . 
  most western culture tends to have a quite positive view of summer as a fun and free time where you can go outside and do outdoorsy things . 
  but vivaldi sees it as this ugly oppressive heat that just bears down on you . 
  i 've always found that interesting . 
  commenting hailcorporate to everything jumped the shark ages ago . 
  four years , surely ? 
  the winter olympics are n't anywhere near the same scale as the olympics . 
   everyone who does n't follow soccer just spends that whole month waiting for everybody else to finally shut up about soccer . 
  got ta be honest , that 's definitely not my view of the soccer world cup . 
  last time it was on i barely even knew it . 
  i * definitely * did n't know when my country was playing or whom they were playing . 
  i just do n't go to that subreddit , and i never visit the front page signed out , so i do n't see that kind of thing . 
  plus people i know irl mostly are n't in to soccer anyway . 
  oh damn really ? 
  which sports ? 
  edit : to provide a serious answer , since i [ just looked it up ] ( https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=olympics%20schedule%202016&amp;mie=oly%2c%5b%22%2fm%2f03tnk7%22%2c1%2c%22r%22%2c1%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2cnull%2c%222016-08-03%22%5d ) , days -2 and -1 seem to be entirely soccer ( or `` football '' , as they call it ) . 
  on day 0 , the day of the opening ceremony , there is also archery . 
  technically , sure . 
  but people do n't tend to say `` the summer olympics '' very often , and even more rarely will they say `` the olympics '' and mean the winter ones .
