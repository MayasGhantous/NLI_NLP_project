  pretty sure it 's just a standard letter though . 
  seriously . 
  every time someone says they do n't like samsung because they fuck with the software , someone comes in and says `` no , touchwiz is great now ! '', 
  this just confirms my feeling . 
  nope . 
  no it is not . 
  fuck samsung and the way they fuck with android . 
  good on them for fixing it , i guess , but that should never have been a problem to begin with . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is for dealing with homebrew content for 5e . 
  for more general stuff , try going to / r/dndnext or / r/dnd . 
  the * better * mystic logo . 
  true , whoops . 
  what cyphers would you suggest are the most common ones for something where the * intent * is to be hand-decryptable ? 
  normally , yes , but we do n't know enough information to know if this may have been a fairly reasonable decision . 
  maybe with the results they found , a fair application of their rules would mean the * highest * anyone would be given is 4 , and they 're being nice by not reducing anyone below that . 
  just speculating here though . 
  i have no idea what went on , and i doubt anyone in this thread does . 
  i just am hesitant to jump to assuming malice . 
  god save the queen , because nothing will save the governor-general !, 
  but seriously , is that really not taught in australian schools ? 
  i did n't go to high school here , so i would n't know . 
  but it seems absolutely astonishing that the single biggest political event in living history would not be covered . 
  op , did you delete the post ? 
  it 's showing as `` deleted '' . 
  if not , mods , could you please explain why it 's been removed ? 
  to be quite frank , what you 're doing here is trying to make a classless progression system . 
  there 's nothing wrong with classless systems , plenty of good games use it . 
  call of cthulhu and mutants & masterminds immediately leap to mind , and there are probably also some traditional medieval fantasy classless games out there . 
  but d&d is not a classless game , and trying to make something that does n't conform to the class design paradigm in d&d is bound for failure .

  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
   similar to a warlock but with less emphasis on melee fighting, 
  i was not aware the warlock had * any * focus on melee fighting ... 
  i do n't think it 's creepy at all . 
  in fact , i think it 's really bloody awesome . 
  you can see exactly where you 've been and when , which can be useful for a variety of reasons ( some of which have been mentioned by others in this thread ) , but also just for general interest 's sake , to go have a look at where you 've been over the past year or whatever . 
  i mean yeah , but that 's only one of the three pacts , and both of the others have a fully casting feel to them . 
  because the basic class structure of 5e requires it . 
  there 's a really simple format that ** all ** classes follow . 
  you get two save proficiencies , generally one strong , one weak . 
  you also usually get a couple of skill proficiencies , some equipment , etc. 
  and then at certain levels , * every * class has an increase to their proficiency bonus . 
  also at certain levels are asis . 
  these are ** non-negotiable ** parts of making classes in 5e . 
  the guy is a known drug cheat , too , so the aussie was understandably not on good terms with him . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  no method of generating a password that you can remember will ever be anywhere near as good as just remembering ** one ** really good password , and having all the others be crazy hard unmemorable passwords randomly generated and stored by the password manager . 
  frankly i 'm disappointed to see that this bill went to the house in this form , and even more disappointed that it passed second reading . 
  it would be one thing to decrease legal liability in order to encourage donations , or even to provide tax incentives to donate . 
  but * forcing * them to do so is a massive over regulation in my opinion . 
  i would urge members to vote against this bill at the final reading unless it is amended . 
   i assume you are working in 5e ? 
  uh , this subreddit is * only * for 5e , so one would assume so .

  oh man that looks so dumb . 
  as if we do n't have enough cooking shows on tv already ... 
  i dunno about the app , but the website is bloody awful . 
  [ this is what you get ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fnp2lt6.png ) . 
  and of course , if you do allow flash to run , you 're subjected to all the awfulness that is flash , including annoying long loading times just to get the interface , and then [ a request to use your local storage ( what in the hells for ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/agbd1wn.png ) . 
  i ca n't even figure out how to get rid of it , since clicking deny does n't seem to actually do anything , and there 's no fucking way i 'm clicking allow . 
  i raised it as an issue and was ignored . 
  indeed . 
  that 's exactly what i was doing here . 
  yeah same . 
  prior to seeing it i was very negative towards leto 's joker , but i 'm cautiously optimistic now . 
  will be interesting to see where he goes in the future . 
  that 's how the medal tally works . 
  gold medals , ties broken by first silver and then bronze . 
  a lot of phones do n't support 4g , you know . 
   it has n't been a day , and we 're boasting we have the most gold medals . 
  i kinda think that 's the point . 
  we 're joking about that . 
  because we all know we 're not going to be in the lead for much longer . 
  if we 're lucky , top 5 . 
  but it 's fun to joke about the fact that we 're currently in the lead . 
  no , we do n't suck . 
  like i said , top 5 is a possibility . 
  but we 're not so good that there 's much chance we can actually * win * the medal count . 
  for reference , the last four olympics we placed 8th , 6th , 4th , and 4th , respectively ( going backwards in time ) . 
  that last one was sydney in 2000 . 
  let 's start a campaign !, 
  personally i would n't make a new top level submission within 24 hours . 
  any smaller changes i would just update in a comment on the post . 
  eh , if you 're a dex fighter , dumping str is n't such a bad idea . 
  there 's little benefit in adding str . 
  the fact that it 's one of their saving throws does n't mean much , since they * still * get their proficiency bonus for it , and it 's * still * one of the rarest saving throws . 
   the biggest defining trait of dragonborn or dragonkin is the breath weapon, 
  personally , i think that 's a perfect reason * not * to put it in there . 
  keep the unique defining trait of the dragonborn unique to them . 
  otherwise you 're showing them up at their best skill . 
  poultices take an hour to make . 
  can they , by chance , be made over the course of a short rest ?
