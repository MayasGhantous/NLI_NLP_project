  or does the ranger have to take a separate hour out of the day somewhere to do it ? 
   `` triangle , bitch ! '', 
  could you explain that bit ? 
  i did n't get it . 
  it seemed like it was a reference to something that was supposed to be well-known . 
  sounds like us last time around ... 
  yes , considering * our * ability to * not * continue a practice that increases suicides , heart problems , and driving accidents , as well as causing confusion in global communications and trade every year , * we * are the ones with a problem .

  oath of ancients is what you 're thinking of . 
  but anyway , it 's super easy for a non-evil person to make a pact with an evil entity . 
  might be harder to justify a cleric doing it , but an oath of vengeance paladin who desperately wants to get revenge on the demons ( or evil humans ) who slaughtered her village could make a pact with a devil to gain more power with which to do so . 
  *** by any means necessary *** is one of the tenets , after all . 
  oath of devotion is a little harder to justify , but perhaps a paladin is forced into making a hard decision to save himself and his loved ones . 
  they 're in mortal danger , and a devil appears and promises the power to save them in exchange for a few favours . 
  he might not be happy about it , but he feels honour-bound to uphold his side of the bargain , because the hells ' power * did * help him save his friends in a moment of crisis . 
  these , of course , are just one way of doing each of those combinations . 
  it would n't be too hard for someone else to come up with a viable alternative . 
  just regarding the title , did you perhaps mean to say `` work * in * progress '' ? 
  haha no worries , just wanted to be sure . 
  gus would be proud of such amazing commentary . 
  blind signatures . 
  from their primary account , they send you a blinded token . 
  you verify that they are the right person and have not yet already sent in a token , then you sign it and send it back . 
  then the user unblinds the token , and sends it to you from the alt account when asking permission to join the subreddit . 
  you get both anonymity and one-alt-per-person . 
  an additional 9.1 % of votes were abstentions , so the amount in favour of his remaining was quite below 1/3 . 
  honestly , i blame wizards . 
  they 're the ones that named it sneak attack , when nine times out of ten it has nothing to do with sneaking . 
  imagine a battle with three teams , all fighting each other . 
  the seam always faces down ( vertically oriented usb ports excepted ) . 
  it 's a part of the actual usb male connector . 
  it 's a thin line that runs down the middle of the connector on the bottom side . 
  wait , you 're using strikeout as spoiler formatting ? 
  * why * there are perfectly good dedicated spoiler formats that * do * seem to * mostly * work on mobile apps , and strikeout has its own purpose already ... 
   rachel definitely knew which buttons to push with him, 
  i do n't think she did . 
  that was all on him . 
  she went to quinn and seemed genuinely upset that she * had n't * managed to solve the problem . 
  is there something wrong with the word `` hit '' ? 
  but i completely agree . 
  i 've not been in this subreddit on a weekly basis , since i binged most of the episodes over the past couple of days , and only caught up just in time for this one . 
  i was surprised to come here and see how much people hated jeremy . 
  like yeah , i hated him too earlier , but this episode so * perfectly * showed how he really feels . 
   why did coleman sneer at rachel 's trauma after showing real concern when he first heard her story ? 
  did he show real concern when he first heard it ? 
  i certainly did n't think so . 
  he comforted her , but the look on his face ( and they showed that look for way too long to not be intentional ) showed a lack of interest or emotion , like he was doing it only because he knew he had to to get what he wanted . 
  i like this . 
  it 's a good policy that , if enforced ( i know i 've seen other subs with a `` no spoilers in title '' policy fail to enforce it , which is infuriating ) will do a really good job of keeping things in line . 
  but why strikethrough ? 
  it already has a purpose , but more importantly , mobile apps do n't show it . 
  using one of the more conventional spoiler syntaxes which have been implemented by mobile apps would work far better . 
  since when did steam sell books ? 
  and also why would you pay $ 15 to illegally download the pdfs ? 
  oh that might be it !, 
  seems a little odd to avoid spoilers for episode ... 4-ish ? 
  in the ep 10 thread though . 
  i had an arsehole on this subreddit find my real name , the university i 'm studying at , and the course i 'm taking within like 5 minutes , just through reddit . 
  this dude would be * unstoppable * at dread . 
  definitely not korean . 
  probably vietnamese . 
  source : lived in both those places, 
  exactly my point . 
  spoilers for suicide squad in the bottom paragraph of this comment . 
  but first of all , that 's * not * the `` whole complexity '' of her character . 
  yes , it absolutely is true that the joker is highly abusive to her , but she fell in love with him as she was treating him at arkham . 
  he 's manipulative as fuck , but the relationship is n't really stockholm syndrome , because she 's not and never has been his prisoner . 
  she 's also , on a few occasions , realised what a dick he is to her , and gotten away . 
  it 's common during these occasions for her to become great friends with poison ivy . 
  anyway , the spoiler is that not in suicide squad it was n't . 
  that film portrayed their relationship as a genuinely loving one . 
  i was really disappointed about that . 
  can i just say , ** fuck ** people who do shit like that . 
  i fucking * hate it * when i 'm going through a thread that 's a little old and some douchbag has deleted their comments , making it impossible to understand what 's going on . 
   and the midichlorians bullshit, 
  why ? 
  i just do n't get why people have a problem with this . 
  in the original series , the jedi are a group long past their prime , and knowledge of the force is largely lost . 
  so it 's mysterious . 
  but in the prequels that 's not the case . 
  the jedi are at their absolute peak saturation . 
  they 're a massive bureaucratic agency , to be sure , but they also have an enormous wealth of knowledge and understanding . 
  so it makes sense that they 'd have better knowledge of how the force works . 
  criticise the poor acting and the atrocious dialogue writing all you like , but midichlorians ? 
  they 're pretty much harmless . 
  1 ) you said you were getting `` all wotc book in pdf '' . 
  this looks like an expansion to another game that gives you access to the classes , races , spells , and other player content from d&d in that game . 
  and also apparently has * some * format for offline play too ? 
  2 ) you said $ 15 . 
  the base game costs $ 40 , and this expansion is a further $ 50 . 
  why would anyone pay $ 90 for a pdf of the player 's handbook , even if that 's what this * does * get you ( which it certainly seems like it does n't ) . 
  so no thanks . 
  honestly i 'm kinda glad of it . 
  not because `` fuck those noobs who do n't care about the game '' , but just because it means ( a ) the servers are more stable , and ( b ) it 's easier to hold on to gyms for longer . 
  you are correct . 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  if you delete your account , that 's exactly what happens . 
  you 'll see the account name as '' [ deleted ] '' ( or something like that ) , but the comment text remains . 
  but you can also delete individual comments ( and there are probably extensions out there that will go through and automatically delete every comment in your history ) .
