  when you do * that * , the comment itself is also deleted , and shows up as '' [ deleted ] '' . 
  as you say , reddit keeps the comment in their database . 
  uh ... it 's 404ing . 
  just so you know , none of them saw this comment , since reddit 's paging mechanism allows a maximum of 3 users mentioned in a comment before it ignores it . 
  been down for me for the last 10 minutes at least . 
  gon na try again in half an hour or so . 
   get access to more spell slots faster, 
  it 's referring to spell slots to be used for smiting , so the only relevant comparison is the number of spell slots compared to straight paladin . 
  yeah , the link syntax is the one that you really should use . 
  there are two separate syntaxes that i 'm aware of :, 
  ` [ spoilers go here ] ( #spoiler ) ` and ` [ spoiler ] ( / s `` spoilers go here '' ) ` . 
  both of them are admittedly slightly more complicated , but they 're useful since they display correctly not only on desktop with css , but also in mobile apps like reddit is fun and alien blue . 
  plus , users are more familiar with them already since that 's what other subreddits use , so there 's no need for `` retraining '' , as it were . 
  the second one above is probably the best option , because what it does when the user is on a platform that does n't support spoilers in styling is displays '' [ spoiler ] ( / s `` it displays just the link '' ) '' rather than accidentally spoiling them . 
  i guess it partly comes down to : which is more important , avoiding people accidentally being spoiled , or making sure that people using weird apps can still read the spoilers ( whether they want to or not ) ? 
  personally , i would say that preventing spoilers is more important . 
  and besides , the vast majority of people are using either the desktop interface or one of the well-known reliable mobile apps ( since reddit 's mobile web interface is awful ) , so catering to that small sector does n't seem important . 
  but perhaps not everyone agrees . 
  edit : regarding mobile apps and strikethrough , i do n't know the current state , but it definitely * used * to be the case that some apps would display text that was supposed to have strikethrough as just normal text . 
  so it would n't even be noticeable that it * is * a spoiler until after they 've read it . 
  more of a plebiscite , really , since the results are non-binding . 
   just like any western politician or journalist of the global media , an australian politician is a whore employed by the criminal mafia of oligarchs which currently owns the banks and secret services , carries out false flag terrorist attacks, 
  -- user on / r/bitcoin, 
  it 's just ... wow . 
  do these people have * any * idea how nutty they sound ? 
  if i saw that comment anywhere other than on that subreddit , it would be a total poe 's law situation . 
  in fact , it would n't even be that , because i would just * assume * it * was * parody . 
  the article was n't very clear , but it seemed to be saying that they 're requiring all the same types of record keeping and verification that traditional currencies are subject to . 
  it sounds completely reasonable , and could actually go a long way toward fixing one of the biggest flaws with bitcoin -- the fact that there is no recourse if you get fucked over on a purchase . 
   it makes sense that you ca n't long rest more than once per day considering you need to sleep for a significant portion of it, 
  it 's actually also in the * rules * that you ca n't get the benefits of a long rest more than once per day . 
  the short rest thing is a house rule , and while it 's * mostly * harmless , i also think that having the * option * to take 3 short rests in a day is a good thing to have , especially when you can already have days with only 1 short rest , or none at all . 
  i actually think this is the problem with the movie . 
  they should n't have * tried * to do suicide squad without at least a handful of its biggest characters having already been introduced in the universe . 
  if we already knew who this universe 's versions of deadshot , harley quinn , and amanda waller were , it would have been a lot easier to make this film work , i think . 
  i * think * that it was a shaped charge . 
  i do n't know how well these work in real life , but in fiction it focusses * all * of the bomb 's energy in the direction you point it . 
  in this case , upwards . 
  water is n't singular , it 's uncountable . 
  you * ca n't * have `` one water '' or `` two waters '' ( except in certain contexts , where `` one water '' is actually just shorthand for `` one bottle of water '' or `` one glass of water '' ) . 
  and that 's what the * actual * difference between `` fewer '' and `` less '' is ( at least historically/by the dictionary -- in actual practice , people use them interchangeably and this is n't a very bad thing ) . 
  countable things : things where it 's * possible * to have `` one '' or `` two '' of it , are compared using `` fewer '' . 
  you can have * one * tree or * two * trees , so trees are countable . 
  by contrast , you ca n't have `` one paint '' or `` one air '' . 
  these things are uncountable , and thus are compared using `` less '' . 
  the notion of using `` singular '' and `` plural '' just does n't even make sense . 
  you 're comparing one thing that you have a greater amount of to another thing that you have a smaller amount of . 
  * by definition * at least one of them is going to be plural , if it 's * possible * for it to be plural . 
  but the notion of plurality in uncountable nouns does n't really make sense to begin with , because ... well , you ca n't count them . 
  i do n't know if they actually support that * per se * . 
  they support a number of the * consequences * of it , or the * reasons * it 's there in the first place . 
  but if they could magically keep the anonymity and all the other things , while * still * somehow being able to force someone to give money back in the event that they did n't actually provide the good/service that was paid for , i think most of the more rational bitcoin supporters probably would be in favour of that . 
  but we do n't actually have a magical way of doing that . 
  but then , i could be wrong . 
  i rarely interact with bitcoin users , and when i do , it tends to be the most vocal nutters . 
  yeah that was my thought , too . 
  it 's not uncommon ( it 's not the * norm * , certainly , but it 's not exactly rare either ) for websites or services to * send you * a password at account creation , rather than allowing you to specify your own , and then allow you to change it later . 
   it might not be good to use your most top-level password and instead use a throwaway or something, 
  but you * should * be using a password manager and using a unique long pseudo-random password on * every * site , anyway . 
  i did n't say it was a good idea , just that it 's completely and utterly unrelated to storing passwords in plaintext . 
  personally i most often see it with things like utilities and banks , where account creation is n't done by the user through a web form , but through some other means -- such as over the phone or in person at an office . 
  so , first of all , [ it 's really quite impressive how good your password has to be to not be cracked if an unsalted hash of it is lost ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u-rbokanys ) . 
  it 's difficult for anyone to give really good advice on how to do it , because one wants to keep their own password method secret . 
  you should aim for 10 + characters with a mix of upper and lower case , numbers , and symbols . 
  but the numbers and symbols should not just be `` 1337 '' , because that 's in dictionaries , and the numbers should n't be something predictable like a date either . 
  randal monroe 's system is one possible good * starting * point , but it 's not very good as an end point . 
  if you want it to be memorable , and you 're not likely a * target * of specific attacks , incorporating the name of the site in some way can be a good way to make passwords that differ from site to site . 
  like monroe says , people are pretty good at remembering real words . 
  we 're even better at remembering sensible phrases . 
  so using a long phrase that means something to you but not necessarily to others , and then putting some simple function on it -- like abbreviating it or transforming to 1337 , though both of those are not really great examples on their own -- as long as that function is easy to remember . 
  ultimately , it 's up to you to make your own system to come up with good passwords that are both easy to remember and unique on a per-site basis , while still being strong . 
  or , just create a free account on lastpass and be done with the whole thing for good . 
  personally , i tried discord for gaming , and it was just shit . 
  we spent half an hour troubleshooting to get it so everyone could hear everyone else the first time we tried it . 
  the second time we tried it , after about 40 minutes we just gave up and went back to skype . 
  skype just works . 
  one person makes a group call to call everyone else , and then we can all hear each other immediately . 
  discord just plain * is n't as good * for audio . 
  i like it as an application for chatrooms with text communication . 
  for that , it 's far , * far * better than skype . 
  but for audio -- which is the prime concern for most gamers -- it just does n't match skype 's ease of use . 
   as a dm , i would say that you would not be able to shoot a different goblin -- because your trigger was `` when a goblin jumps out '' , so if a goblin jumps out , that 's the trigger, 
  that 's * incredibly * lame ruling from a fun perspective ( why in the hells would you so arbitrarily just go `` no , you ca n't do things that make sense , because my really particular way of reading a slightly ambiguous rule says so '' . 
  it honestly just sounds like a dm trying to be a dick for the sake of being a dick . 
  ) , but it also does n't actually make sense . 
  his trigger was `` when ** a ** goblin jumps out '' , not `` when * the first * goblin jumps out '' . 
  if one jumps out and he ignores it , he has n't used his reaction yet , so when another one jumps out , that 's also fulfilling the trigger requirements . 
  there 's quite literally no reasonable way to deny them the ability to attack it . 
   any feature triggered by the attack action that is n't limited to your turn, 
  out of interest , are there any such features in the game right now ? 
  nothing that uses a saving throw can crit , only things with attack rolls can . 
  great comic , though . 
  darths & droids is another great one , which takes the same kind of premise , but for star wars . 
  sneak attack , like divine smite , procs ( i hope i 'm using that word right -- i only know its usage from seeing others use it in this subreddit ) on `` a creature you hit with an attack '' , not the attack action . 
  so reactions gained by opportunity attacks or battlemasters also count . 
  i was really only thinking about dealing damage , but you 're absolutely right . 
  if we refer to all possible rolls in the game , only attack rolls and death saves can crit . 
  i do n't know if it 'll work on this case . 
  apple pay is worth a lot less in australia than in the us , because tap to pay through debit and credit cards is already ubiquitous . 
  your edits made it sound like there were tens or hundreds of comments .
