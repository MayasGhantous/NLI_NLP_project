  i was surprised to get to the bottom and see a grand total of three ... only one of which disagreed with you , and only in response to the original post , not * any * of the subsequent edits . 
  switching to dvorak is an improvement i can implement in my own life and achieve great results . 
  switching to a base 12 counting system is useless unless everyone switches . 
  the improvements in base 12 are also minor enough to just not be worth it . 
  on the other hand , switching from using pi to tau is an incredible idea and makes learning and * truly understanding * trigonometry , and every area that touches upon it , so much more intuitive and simple . 
  it was earlier this year , a long time after it had been out , but before the new direct calling features . 
  the sidebar medal tally is wrong . 
  hungary should be in third place , followed by australia . 
  unfortunately rules do n't actually work this way . 
  no crits or crit fails on saving throws ( except death saves ) . 
  plus , this is why high level bad guys have legendary resistance . 
  to stop a single bad roll ruining whole campaigns . 
  oh that 's great . 
  absolutely awesome . 
  i was resistant to the idea of him being the joker because i do n't like the idea of the joker appearing before batman does . 
  but if they use the show to give a drawn out origin story for the joker , in parallel to the origin story of batman himself , that could be absolutely * fantastic * . 
  underscores for functions and camel case for variables is a perfectly normal and acceptable style to use . 
  what bothers me is the fact that there 's a space after the function name , before its arguments , and * not * after the arguments and before the brace . 
  in most common languages , writing ` variable = value ` * assigns * the value of ` value ` * to * the variable called ` variable ` . 
  so , in this case , it sets ` iscrazymurderingrobot ` to ` true ` . 
  what the programmer was * trying * to do is * check * if the value of ` iscrazymurderingrobot ` is * already * ` true ` , which should be done by using ` = = ` , which is the comparison operator . 
  ah cool , thanks . 
  yeah , what part of '' * everything * changed '' is op not getting ? 
  true . 
  i was just trying to keep things relatively simple for a non-coder . 
  it 's the same reason i did n't mention that the * actual * way this should have been done is ` if ( iscrazymurderingrobot ) ` . 
  is there a chance of having at least some subreddit css work on mobile , too ? 
  i 've noticed , for example , that tv based subs that use css for spoilers do n't work on mobile . 
  maybe a reddit-wide implementation of spoiler syntax would work ? 
  i like it . 
  a lot . 
  i will definitely be presenting this to my group to see if they like it . 
  i 've definitely felt as though the standard rest rules simply do not work , because the assumption of 6 encounters per day and 2 short rests simply does not hold up in reality . 
  but the gritty realism rules are far , far too punishing on long rest characters , if the campaign has even the * slightest * sense of urgency to it . 
  the world my group is playing in is intended to be low-magic anyway , so the restriction in spell slots that something like these rules would inevitably add is probably a boon . 
  a have a few thoughts , though . 
  ** pick pockets ** is a really interesting one in terms of flavour , but my experience has tended to be that money is rarely much of an issue after about level 3 or 4 , so unless the * amount * of money gained was far more substantial , i ca n't see that being a useful boon . 
  plus , it does n't allow for ( a ) more wealthy areas to be more beneficial than poor ones , or ( b ) a chance for getting caught -- which i feel should be an inherent part of any attempt to steal . 
  no love at all for half and third casters with ** spellcaster 's recovery ** ? 
  i know that the maths could get complicated , but perhaps a sidebar with optional rules to allow levels in paladin or ranger to grant a quarter of a spell slot each . 
  or is there some broader reason you did n't do that ? 
  could you explain ** well-travelled ** ? 
  i 'm not 100 % sure i understand it . 
  is it that , by choosing it , you 're essentially getting two * other * options for free , one of which may not be one a ranger could normally get ? 
  so by picking it , you 'd have a total of * three * idle talents on your character sheet , one of which is functionally useless after the fact ? 
  ( not that it 's a problem , just trying to clarify how it works . ), 
  ** deep sleep ** and ** deeper sleeper ** look pretty much identical , except that the latter is exclusive to barbs . 
  i take it this is to allow barbs to regain * two * levels of exhaustion ? 
  perhaps deeper sleeper should have a prerequisite of deep sleep , and deeper sleeper 's description should explicitly call out the synergy ? 
  i presume that ** sparring ** requires you have another party member ( on npc ) to spar with , who also uses that option ? 
  but anyway , yeah i really like this . 
  nicely done . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  you can also easily have the focus changed on you by a script on the page . 
  oh that 's actually pretty clever . 
  still does n't excuse the brace though . 
  just a tip , apparently the markdown parser strips trailing whitespace from < code  blocks , since both your examples look the same ( unless viewing the markdown source ) . 
  ` interact_with_humans ( ` vs ` interact_with_humans ( ` makes it clearer . 
  i could be wrong , but the language * looks * like just plain c ( especially since the style guide being used is a particularly common one in embedded systems ) . 
  c does n't have ` = = = ` . 
  i * believe * the idea is that you 'll feel nicer if you 're woken up gently . 
  the problem is that the 6 -- 8 encounters per long rest ( with 2 short rests in that time ) is bad design , because it does n't match up with how most people play . 
  the result is that long rest characters tend to be much more powerful than short rest ones , since their features -- designed to be used in 6 encounters -- actually get used in fewer than that , while short rest characters do n't get to show their comparative stamina resulting from multiple short rests . 
  gritty realism * tries * to address this by making long rests more uncommon , but will generally make them far * too * infrequent , resulting in long rest characters being * hugely * nerfed , so that short rest ( or no rest ) characters are the only real option, 
  what this does is allow long rest characters * some * of the benefits of a long rest during a short rest ( or some alternate benefits , if they prefer ) , to make a large number of short rests en lieu of a long rest a viable option , which in turn makes gritty realism a viable way to play . 
  i take it this is meant to work similarly to the barb 's exhaustion recovery ? 
  take sorcerous renewal only * after * having already taken spellcaster 's recovery ? 
  but in this case , one offers a lesser impact than the other ? 
  honestly , i * have n't * seen a good solution for it that i liked , before this . 
  the problem , from my perspective , is that to get 6 -- 8 encounters in a day , a dm has to go way over the top . 
  in anything other than a dumb dungeon crawl , it does n't really make sense . 
  so players overly long resting is n't really the problem , it 's that dms who aim for a sense of realism ( which i think is a good thing , and * should * trump mechanical balance ) end up throwing too few encounters per day . 
  gritty realism helps a little on its own . 
  you have to rest for a whole week to get the benefits of a long rest . 
  if the quest they 're on has even a * little * time pressure , that 's just not feasible . 
  so it 's much easier to get that 6 -- 8 encounters per long rest -- or even more . 
  the problem then becomes that long rests are probably going to be * too * infrequent relative to short rests , so you need something to balance it out for long rest classes , which is what this idle talents system aims to do . 
  i thought it was , like , xxl running , a place for people who are overweight to talk about running . 
  i have n't looked an awful lot at the subreddit , but that would certainly match up with its namesake . 
  he takes something that should be a good thing ( free and open-source software ) , and takes it to an absolutely insane extent where absolute dogmatic adherence to an ideology is more important absolutely anything else . 
  you 're right . 
  uber is an absolutely despicable company . 
  it 's quite well known among anyone who 's read even a little bit into how they operate . 
  but they also provide a really , * really * good service . 
  and people on the whole tend to value , well , * value * more than they do ethics , when making purchasing decisions . 
  that 's not really such a bad thing , in my opinion . 
  it 's not . 
  but it 's also wrong to blame uber for not paying tax that they are not legally obligated to . 
  the government * should * remove loopholes that allow them to legally not pay taxes . 
  same goes for apple and amazon and whoever else is n't paying taxes through these sorts of schemes . 
  but * nobody * should be criticising them for not paying taxes right now , because they are neither legally nor morally obligated to . 
  yes it does . 
  your point ? 
  i use rif . 
  but clearly , in a thread by the admins , the thing being discussed is the reddit mobile site , which supports neither spoiler tags nor custom css . 
  because why would they be ? 
  are * you * morally obligated to * not * look for ways to decrease how much tax you can legally pay ? 
  when it gets to that line of code , it just executes the code inside the conditional . 
  the act of assigning actual returns the value being assigned , so for the purposes of evaluating the conditional , all the code saw was ` true ` .
