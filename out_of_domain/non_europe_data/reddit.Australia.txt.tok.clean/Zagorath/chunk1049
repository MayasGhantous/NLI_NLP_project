  [ here 's one clickbaity listacle of a few of the things they 've done ] ( http://observer.com/2016/02/ubers-10-worst-actions-threats-lies-sexism-shady-business-deals/ ) . 
  personally i had only heard of about two thirds of those stories . 
  [ and here 's another article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/10/03/god-view-uber-allegedly-stalked-users-for-party-goers-viewing-pleasure/#5a2284a3f84e ) detailing another of the more tasteless events in uber 's history , that was n't covered in the previous article . 
  basically , instead of * checking * to see if the value of a variable was ` true ` , it * changed * that variable to be ` true ` , no matter what . 
  you can see our whole [ hall of fame here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  yes , dvorak on smartphones is a bad idea . 
  the things that made qwerty useful on old mechanical typewriters -- the need to separate keys out so common pairs were n't near each other -- also becomes useful on mobile keyboards . 
  the best way to type on mobile is to rely heavily on autocorrect , but with dvorak , so many common letters are really close to each other , that autocorrect will not be as accurate . 
  this is utterly ridiculous . 
  the united states is one of our closest allies , and this motion to condemn their president is an international embarrassment . 
  the members supporting this should be ashamed of themselves . 
  i say well done to the prime minister for trying to close this rubbish down as quickly as possible . 
  i would urge all members ( especially my local member , / u/phyllicanderer ) to support the prime minister in this . 
  it 's one thing to discuss the state of international relations . 
  it 's another thing entirely to discuss * condemning * the * head of state * of a country with which we are allies . 
  do we really need two bots doing this same thing ? 
  especially since one of them does n't even bother putting anything other than a bare link ... 
  if you 're going to ban one of the two bots , make it navigatorbot . 
  smallsubbot at leasts provides some nice presentation . 
  though banning * both * also makes sense . 
  i have n't read it in detail , and i do n't really plan to ( i just do n't care enough about rangers -- especially the spellcasting kind -- to do so ) . 
  but a couple of quick points :, 
  the names for the favoured enemies are bad . 
  giant killer is n't about killing giants in particular , and dragon slayer does n't even once * mention * dragons in its features . 
  many , many typos and spelling errors in the rationale section . 
  to name a few :, 
  * since it 's inception, 
  * aragon of middle earth, 
  * cited statics, 
  * the class ' two core, 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js91p-vmsf0 ) ? 
  if you 're going to go about it by removing classes , you 're going to have to remove basically every spellcaster apart from the main three arcane ones ( and the 1/3 caster archetypes ) , if you want to achieve that effect . 
  that 's * a lot * that 's being removed . 
  brissy 's bicycle infrastructure is pretty good , and the laws for cyclists are the best in the country , but by the gods it 's crazy hilly . 
  i ca n't imagine it 'd be better overall than flatter places like canberra , melbourne , and adelaide . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd recommend a movie version of the witcher . 
  i still have n't finished it , because i gave up somewhere around the second or third chapter ( the port of it for os x is * unplayably * bad ) , but even as far as i got , i could tell it was one of those games where your personal choices really come back to make a difference . 
  it was done in a * really * interesting way , and things came back to bite you completely unexpectedly , but at the same time it made sense in hindsight . 
  that 's a big aspect that you would miss out on in a movie version . 
  unless there 's a version that actually plays through all possible paths and lets you choose through annotations or links in the description , i guess . 
  you really do need to see it though . 
  it 's an absolutely amazing show . 
  oh man , this is so exciting !, 
  i do n't know how it 's going to work , since on supergirl 's earth , green martians were eradicated by the white martians , who are * actually evil * . 
  so i 'm not sure she would work if she has a similar backstory to yj ( which is what really made me love the character ) .

   also , what 's the current best ide ? 
  idle . 
  i like to live dangerously . 
  i always imagine it as like the stereotypical `` blast '' / `` beam '' of energy from many sci-fi and fantasy stories . 
  like iron man 's in the mcu , or vaatu 's blasts in korra season 2 . 
  nah , his blasts are more like * fireball * . 
  yeah i was n't the biggest fan of korra either -- i do n't think i could tell you the names of any of the red lotus members , not even the flying dude -- but i absolutely loved beginnings parts 1 and 2 . 
  to me , those are up there with the original show . 
  this is cool , but does n't even come ** close ** to being sly . 
  hey sorry , but i 've removed this post . 
  this subreddit is for sharing stories about roleplaying games , not discussing rules and character builds . 
  you should try / r/dnd if you 're playing an older edition , or / r/dndnext if you 're playing 5e . 
   if you want inspiration to expire on short rests , some people might just not want to take rests !, 
  xd i would not want to use that rule myself , but if the game is more fun for you with it , go ahead and use it !, 
  your fun is right . 
  as long as you are having fun , you are doing nothing wrong . 
  the reason it 's a good idea is quite simple , actually . 
  players tend to hoard their inspiration for a really long time . 
  if they never spend it , you never get the chance to award it . 
  if they know they have n't got much time before it will expire anyway , they 're more inclined to actually use it . 
  valor is also the most hardcore of the three teams . 
  just based on level , it 's more like a 3000 cp dragonite claiming it needs to team up with a caterpie to take down a 2000 cp charizard . 
  not that that 's relevant anyway , since what 's important in this case is how hardcore each team is , and valor wins that contest . 
   ash did n't need misty or brock to be the very best, 
  yes he did . 
  he ** really ** did . 
  ash is a fucking awful trainer that needed every bit of help he possibly could get . 
  personally , i 've found it to be a * really * clumsy text editor . 
  it 's probably my second most common python editor , after vim , but it 's pretty terrible . 
  obviously it 's not a fully-featured ide with robust debugging features etc. , but just comparing its text editing capabilities to those of sublime or atom , or even notepad + + , and you really feel like you 're having to work against it to do what you want . 
   but the actual content of the video was great, 
  yeah i agree . 
  they got that one little point wrong , but it 's not like they ever actually expounded on the idea in the video , or gave examples of it happening . 
  it 's just a line they briefly said . 
  they also defended that line in the comments on youtube , which was ... disappointing . 
  but still , like lexie said , it 's not something that had a lot of bearing on the rest of the content of the video . 
  they had it as a brief throwaway line in the video , and every aspect they went into more detail about , or each example they gave , was more or less accurate . 
  different sports have different ideas of what 's considered acceptable sportsmanship . 
  apparently soccer players consider it unacceptable to play mind games during a penalty shootout , but gridiron finds the same kind of thing acceptable . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that in either case , i do n't think . 
  but then again ... in soccer it 's perfectly acceptable to take a dive , whereas other football codes that sort of thing does n't fly . 
  it took me a while to realise you meant project manager , and not prime minister . 
  i can see it going either way , really ... 
  i would 've thought he 's just anti-closed-software . 
  like stallman-lite . 
  [ no , really ] ( https://youtu.be/wwczf4bgqgi?t=314 ) . 
  ( 7:25 for an even more direct explanation . ), 
  gon na be honest , i googled `` soho '' because i thought it might be the name of a pok\u00e9mon i could n't remember ... 
  my favourite class and race were a pair from a * really * late 4e book that i would put low odds on us seeing again even if they * did * release content at a faster rate . 
  plus , both of them are available through some very high quality homebrew stuff ( the class is one of the highest reviewed ones on / r/boh5e ) .
