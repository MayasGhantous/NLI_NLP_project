  because of that , no , i do n't think i do mind this pace . 
  i 'm glad that they 're putting an emphasis on balance and on ensuring that everything they put out really serves a * purpose * , and has a strong reason , both in terms of flavour and mechanics , for existing . 
  unearthed arcana is a great way to fill some of the gaps , but even it seems to be interested in those same aspects to some extent . 
  and to be honest , i think the * best * thing about ua is getting insight into wizards ' * thought process * behind how they go about designing things . 
  it 's also nice because it means i can afford to buy everything they put out in terms of content . 
  when volo 's comes out , that 'll be just the 5th d&d book i buy . 
  much more affordable than previous editions would have been . 
   most things that are your ` favorite class/race ' , can be refluffed from already existing material for the most part, 
  yes and no . 
  there certainly are a * lot * of things that can . 
  for example , my preferred way of dealing with the criticism that the 5e ranger ( deservedly ) receives is just to multiclass rogue and ( dex ) fighter . 
  i 'm more interested in an ithilien or d\u00fanedain style ranger than one that has a pet or casts spells anyway . 
  that works * great * with just a slight reflavouring of the existing content . 
  but there are a * lot * of things that really just * ca n't * be done in this way . 
  the easiest way to find examples of this would be to look at reviews on / r/boh5e , and look for things that received a ** theme/creativity ** mark over about 8 or 9 . 
  most of them are fairly obvious things that definitely deserve their own option and would n't work well reflavouring existing content, 
  meta : that 's not how it works, 
   a character that was supposedly in his 80s or 90s . 
  uhh ... jean-luc picard was born in 2305 , and encounter at farpoint took place in 2364 . 
  preemptive strike ( the penultimate episode -- incidentally , one directed by stewart ) was in 2370 . 
  the show had some flash forwards to where he was older , but within the main timeline of the show , the oldest he got was 65 . 
  it 's far from uncommon for german composers to write certain instructions in german , and i know satie is ( in ) famous for writing rather detailed french instructions in his works , though tempi and dynamics are pretty much universally in italian . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  yeah sorry , that 's pretty much the same issue , with the same solution . 
  top level submissions need to be actual content that can be taken and used , even if it is n't perfectly balanced . 
  but if you want to ask for help finding it in [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4vmeir/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) , that would be fine . 
  i like that you kept the weird spacing with the commas . 
  that sort of attention to detail is what makes this so great . 
  the expression was actually flipped at some point , and it makes no fucking sense as a result . 
  it was originally `` you ca n't eat your cake and have it too '' . 
  that 's definitely what i meant above . 
  where are you , because i 'm like 90 % sure i could walk in to mind games at the myer centre in brisbane and buy one off the shelf ... 
  first of all , nobody here is a lawyer , or if they are , they still should not be providing legal advice in an unofficial capacity . 
  that said , what the law strictly requires , and what is common practice , are two different things . 
  legally it is ( to my complete layperson understanding ) very simple : unless the artist has released it under a permissive licence ( such as a creative commons one -- anything where they 've explicitly said `` people can feel free to use this under these conditions '' ) , you can not legally use it in your work , no matter what . 
  you would have to contact the artist specifically and acquire permission from them , and then adhere to whatever terms they specified ( providing credit , etc. ) . 
  in my observation , i have seen many people use artwork for which i am doubtful they have obtained permission . 
  while not technically legal , most people do n't really seem to care too much , as long as you 're not making money selling your homebrew . 
  giving credit to the artist is * always * recommended as a show of respect . 
  i thought sea urchin spines were venomous ? 
  did n't police catch some using cgi video calls ? 
  could n't those also be used ? 
  yes , but i mean using cgi kids as a method by which to do that . 
  you could make cgi porn instead , could n't you ? 
  i 'd assume if the video calls are convincing enough , it would be possible . 
  oh , interesting . 
  where are those species mostly found , do you know ? 
  this gif could also be used on / r/nonononoyes . 
  other comments in this thread seem to suggest that studies have shown that porn * does * work ( and some of them have linked to such studies ) in sating their urges . 
  the obvious problem is that the creation of said porn is itself a crime . 
  assuming those studies are not incorrect ( and you 'll have to forgive me if i take those studies over the word of one guy who says he has `` attended a few conferences '' ) , it seems fairly intuitive to me that if it 's possible to create a cgi equivalent , that would achieve similar results without the human cost . 
   one of these is the fact is that most soldiers were obviously trained to fight right-handed opponents , so a moment of hesitation could give you a second of advantage when in combat . 
  actually , i can * definitely * say that in a one-on-one situation , it * does * make quite a substantial advantage . 
  it 's more than just a moment of hesitation , but also the fact that the guards you need to use most often , and the way in which you use them , are quite substantially different when facing an opposite handed opponent to a same handed opponent . 
  amusingly , this means that two left-handed fighters are often as much confused with each other as a right hander is against a left hander . 
  but that 's from personal experience in sport fencing . 
  for something a little more historical , the fiore dei liberi treatise does mention techniques for facing a left-handed opponent , which at least suggests that it was common * enough * to be worth mentioning . 
  not necessarily that it was nearly as common as today , but at least enough to warrant a mention . 
  i have heard that the bolognese also mentions left handers a fair bit more explicitly , though i do n't know the exact nature of those occurrences . 
  just an fyi , all tieflings * are n't * evil . 
  that 's not even suggested in the phb . 
  it just says they `` might not have an innate tendency toward evil , but many of them end up [ evil ] '' . 
  in reality , it 's more of them being normal people whom society * views * as evil and treats accordingly , which can in turn result in many of them turning to evil . 
  to be fair , prior to its release everyone was talking about how modular 5e would be and how it would let you play the most barebones way , but also add on a heap of extra things to make aspects more in-depth or complicated if that 's what you want . 
  so far , we have n't really gotten that . 
  i do n't mind too much , because for the most part i 'm happy with bare bones , but you ca n't really say that promise has been delivered . 
  a more detailed crafting system would be one great step towards delivering on that expectation . 
  daylight saving time is used in most of north america , a few small parts of south america , nearly all of europe , the southern states of australia , as well as new zealand and a couple of african countries . 
  gmt ( which really is more properly called utc these days , though in effect they 're the same thing ) is the central time by which other time zones are calculated . 
  if you live in new york , your time zone is utc-5 , or utc-4 during dst . 
  the uk is utc +0 , or just `` utc '' normally , but then in summer , when dst is in effect , they are utc +1 . 
  but note that their start and end dates for dst are slightly different to in america . 
  the east coast of australia is utc +10 , but the southern states which observe dst go to utc +11 during the summer ( note that this means centred \\* around * january * , because southern hemisphere ) . 
  edit : [ found a map ] ( http://www.newsinsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/clockschange.gif ) . 
  also apparently a couple of countries in the middle-east . 
  edit the second : clarification, 
  man daylight saving time annoys the fuck out of me . 
  here in queensland we do n't have it , but there 's a * very * vocal part of the population ( i assume they 're by far a minority , but they claim to be the majority in the south east of the state ) . 
  we also get made fun of by the southern states which * do * observe it . 
  fuck all that . 
  it 's stupid as fuck and literally causes deaths ^ [ [ source ] ] ( http://time.com/3549442/daylight-saving-time-traffic-deaths/ ) on top of the communications confusion it causes . 
  and all for literally no tangible benefit . 
  [ except for those parts of it that did n't ] ( https://youtu.be/84awtseb2-4?t=305 ) . 
  waterborne adventures was pretty great , and some of it has actually made the game proper ( after adjustments based on feedback , which is after all the whole point of doing ua in the first place ) . 
  and even if you did n't like the feats themselves ( personally i do -- for the item ones , at least ) , the feat ua gave some great insight into the process of feat designing , which is immensely useful to homebrewers . 
  i also quite liked kits of old and that old black magic , even if they 're less broadly useful . 
  the only thing that i can say that others have n't already is that you got ta turn your camera on the side !, 
  i caught an ivysaur the first time i saw it . 
  i do n't know how many throws it took , but i do n't think it was many . 
  like three at most . 
  yeah i just used january as the midpoint of summer , to differentiate it from july in the us or europe . 
  yeah , rereading it i can see the ambiguity . 
  i meant it * centres * around january , not it * starts * around january . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
   allo will be a messaging ... service based on a user 's phone number like whatsapp, 
  urgh really ? 
  the reason i hate whatsapp is because phone numbers should be used for fucking ** phone network ** things .
