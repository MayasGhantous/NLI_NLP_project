  it 's in the damned name . 
  i do n't want my phone number tied to an internet-based messaging service . 
  not to mention that * strongly * implies that they 'll never be creating a proper desktop or web client for it that works independently of the phone , which pretty much makes it dead on arrival ... 
  the imessage method means you never know whether a message you 're sending is going to be an sms ( and potentially cost extra money ) or an im . 
  that , in turn , means you do n't know which features the recipient can support or in what presentation the recipient will see it . 
  whatsapp has a web and a desktop application , but from my googling it seems it only works when your phone is running , which kinda defeats the point of a desktop application to begin with . 
  if they can get both : a * true * desktop application * and * not conflate sms and im within the same app , then * maybe * using a phone number can be forgiven . 
  it 's still a dumb idea and there 's no good reason for it when we 've been using email addresses or custom ids/usernames as identification for literally decades now , but if they do n't screw up the rest of it then maybe that can be put aside . 
  but honestly , i doubt that 's how it 's going to go . 
  as far as i 'm aware , it adds every active subreddit which is a permutation of `` yes '' and `` no '' repeated . 
   it 's much easier to just type in your phone number than to think of which email to use and type in the password and click on the verification links . 
  whoa now . 
  you do n't need a password to use your account ? 
  this set up is just sounding worse and worse the more i learn about it . 
  if it were a good system , the only thing that would change is replacing email with phone number . 
  that substitution does n't get rid of the importance of a password . 
  but that raises a couple more problems . 
  what do you do if you get a new phone number , * especially * as a result of having lost your phone ? 
  do you now essentially have a new account where you have to tell everyone your new number ? 
  are you not able to remotely sign out your lost device ? 
  that 's ** terrible ** . 
  literally ** any ** other authentication method they could have possibly thought of would allow for both these things . 
  having to tell someone your number so you can keep in touch over an internet-capable device is * insane * . 
   it 's one of the reasons why whatsapp got so popular ( in countries that are n't us or canada ), 
  and australia, 
   you did n't have to create an account with its own password nor did you have to fiddle with emails . 
  everyone knows their own phone number so just use that and you 're good to go . 
  well , first of all , knowing one 's email address these days is akin to having known one 's phone number in the '90s and earlier . 
  but phone numbers themselves are * much * harder to remember , thanks to the rise of address books . 
  i went the entire period from 2007 to 2012 not knowing mine , and that 's not exactly unusual . 
  but more importantly , utter negligence on the part of users is not an excuse for why a shitty platform that just happened to get popular is a * good * at form to be modelled after . 
  no , it 's the first of december , because starting a season on the day that represents the * peak * of that season 's traits makes no sense , and for some reason australia is one of the few countries to recognise this . 
  the date that the seasons change is a human construct . 
  we get to decide when it is . 
  there are two commonly used systems for how to decide it . 
  there 's the astronomical system , where summer starts with the summer solstice , autumn with the autumnal equinox , etc. 
  then there 's the meteorological system , where each season starts on the first of a given month . 
  both systems are in use around the world , there 's no objective one that is the * right * one and the other is * wrong * . 
  the season of summer is characterised by its long days and hot weather . 
  the summer solstice is the longest day of the year , and it comes long after the weather has started feeling hot . 
  to m , this is a * strong * argument in favour of the meteorological system . 
  another argument is simple practicality . 
  seasons start on the same day every year , and they exactly coincide with months , which are another useful time keeping system we 've developed . 
  perhaps you have an argument as to why the astronomical system is the better one , and i 'd be interested to hear it if you do . 
  but so far i 've failed to see any good arguments in favour of it . 
   i think hangouts is the only exception, 
  what ? 
  imessage and whatsapp are the exceptions here . 
  hangouts , facebook messenger , skype , discord , telegram , wechat ( popular in china ) , and kakaotalk ( in korea ) all use more conventional username systems , not to mention all of the older im services that people have been used to in the past like windows live messenger , yahoo messenger , etc. 
  services that break from this norm are by far the exception , and for good reason ( as laid out above ) . 
  hey , these are great !, 
  you should really consider cross-posting them on / r/unearthedarcana for an audience more specifically interested in homebrew stuff . 
  i really do n't think we see enough of this light tweaking and reflavouring homebrew , so it 's really refreshing to see an example of how it can be applied . 
  my favourite easter egg is from s04e20 , when chuck is reading a game of thrones , and says something to the effect of `` no eddard , you do n't let your kids keep a direwolf ! '', 
  that episode aired the week before game of thrones s01e01 premiered . 
  i just thought the writers did an amazing job on that pop culture reference . 
  hear , hear, 
  hear , hear !, 
  that is so dumb ... 
  not all of it looks that pretty . 
  self posts just like this one a perfectly fine over there . 
  plus , a lot of the things that * are n't * just self posts are simple things from [ the homebrewery ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ ) ( which i 'm guessing is the website you were thinking of ) without much attention paid to artwork -- many do n't bother with art at all . 
  for example , [ here 's this post , written up on the homebrewery ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/hjbnxskq ) . 
  i took the liberty to change around the wording and order in which some features came a little , to fit the 5e style , but for the most part it 's exactly as you wrote it . 
  i 've pm 'd you the homebrewery edit url if you want to use that as a template for future work . 
  art is definitely a challenge to put in , since there 's no graphical interface . 
  but with a little playing around it 's possible to get things looking nice . 
  it 's just using html and css , really . 
  what 's sorry ? 
  yeah , but * why * ? 
  why * would * you do it i thought th ** e ** bold ** e ** thing was dumb , but this is somehow even * worse * . 
  oh interesting . 
  i do n't think i 've ever come across that before . 
  from context ( next to monopoly ) i got the impression it was a really widely known and played game , at least in the country / u/roarkewa is from ? 
  ah right , thanks . 
  i 'm familiar with most of those other games ( though i only know ouija boards as a thing in the movies -- did n't realise they were a real thing people actually used ) . 
  i thought monopoly and cluedo were published by hasbro , though ? 
  maybe the publishers just differ in different countries , i guess . 
   it 's not very good though, 
  to be fair , it was in a list right next to monopoly , so what would you expect ? 
  ^ ( then again , catan is often listed near monopoly , and it 's pretty great ... ), 
   parker brother 's parent company is hasbro . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i 'm like 80 % sure they 're published directly by hasbro over here , but i 'll have to take a closer look next time i 'm in a gaming store . 
  i really do n't understand the sentiment of this subreddit . 
  i would consider myself an * above average * user of my phone , and i get by fine with my 16 gb nexus 4 , and have done for years now . 
  sure , i could n't put my whole ~ 12 gb music collection on there , and i have to have my podcast app set to autodelete podcasts after they 're played , but it still works just fine . 
  most users use their phones way less than i do . 
  i know people on this subreddit are , by and large , much heavier users than me , and for them , 16 gb is completely unacceptable . 
  but it really just * is n't * `` way too low '' in some factual objective way like everyone on this subreddit makes out it is . 
  it just is n't . 
   if google again targets a lower price point ( like with past nexus phones ), 
  huh ? 
  nexus phones have n't been targeting lower price points since the 4 . 
  is that their us prices ? 
  they 're a * lot * more over here ... the 4 was quite reasonable , but everything after that went * way * up . 
  i 'm in australia , but now that you mention it , that makes sense . 
  back when the nexus 4 came out , the aussie dollar was actually * stronger * than the usd ( buying about $ 1.05 ) . 
  not long after that it dropped back to more normal levels of $ 0.60 -- $ 0.80 . 
  yeah .
