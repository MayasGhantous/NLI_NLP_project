  the joys of the so-called dutch disease and of being a largely raw material-based economy . 
  so , i know i 'm * super * late to the party here , but i just wan na point out that a * lot * of great comedy shows end on a down note . 
  the office is probably the most famous example of this -- although with the new david brent movie coming out later this year , it might be possible to say it 's no longer a sad ending . 
  i have n't actually watched it , but i believe the ending of seinfeld is also not a happy one . 
  the end of the main run of blackadder is another classic example . 
  and for a show that 's a little less on the comedy side , but still generally very lighthearted , the ending of chuck was a tearjerker too . 
  it 's appearing off for me on chrome . 
  pages 3 and 4 both have stuff trying to go into the `` third '' column . 
  just a tip , you can get normal paragraphing by inserting a line with just four asterisks ( '' **** '' ) . 
  if you want to draw a horizontal line across , just put two lines of that in a row .

  hi sorry , but i 've removed this . 
  this subreddit is for sharing stories about roleplaying games . 
  for videos of terrain you 've made , you might want to try / r/dnd . 
   the source is called timesnewsuk for gods sake , wtf even is timesnews ? 
  gon na be honest , i thought it was * the times * . 
  the url and name had me fooled . 
  i 'm sure that 's their intention , too , which makes me quite astonished that it 's not a trademark violation . 
  it was only when i saw the `` removed - blog spam '' flair on this post that i looked into it a bit more and realised it was n't the times . 
  it 's only a really brief moment , and from memory ( though i could be wrong ) it was right at the beginning of the episode , if that helps . 
  you clerics think you are so high and mighty , but really you are nothing more than weak suckups to your higher masters . 
  why not embrace what you truly are : a warlock who simply lacks the ambition to form a * true * pact and gain * real * power . 
  interrobangs are the best . 
  translate that , 
  wow . 
  at least it 's a `` real '' key signature , i guess , and not like , f # , a # , d # only , or some weird thing like that . 
  i 'll drink to that , '' bellows a heavily-armored paladin, 
  i read this as if it were a loud belligerent drunk -- emphasis on the drunk . 
  makes sense . 
  poor paladin has to do something to feel good about his life choices . 
  so i made a deal to do a few favours for a devil in exchange for powers beyond belief ? 
  it 's certainly way better than dedicating my entire * life * to serving a god like a cleric , or to studying old tombs like a wizard . 
  four ? 
  who 's the fourth ? 
  oh interesting . 
  i 've never thought of them as arcane . 
  that 's literally the only way to get a nexus in australia . 
  it 's always mods . 
  there are demons in it ? 
  is the show anything like constantine was ? 
  because that show was incredible and i 'm so upset it was cancelled . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking advice on how to find existing homebrew material . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4xtgfh/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4xtgfh/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hey , sorry , but i do n't think your chances are good . 
  it came out in 2000 , which is before os x came out . 
  that means it was probably written for classic mac os , and wo n't run on the newer platform . 
  most games that came out between 2001 and 2006 also wo n't run , because even though they were on os x , they were on the powerpc version , not the intel version . 
  apple does n't make rosetta available any more , so they ca n't be run either . 
  i do n't see the relevance ? 
  maybe that was a bad fad , but this one is even worse . 
  not to mention the mods are kind of arseholes . 
   what i find untenable in most d&d religions is that they 're most often henotheistic or polytheistic . 
  there 's rarely monotheism . 
  what 's untenable about this ? 
  the real world took * millennia * before any noteworthy monotheistic religions evolved , and as you say , `` it complicates things '' when the gods are actually real and evidenced . 
  i would go further and say it does n't * complicate * things so much as it * completely makes any argument for monotheism in this world irrelevant * . 
  i agree with basically every other point you made , though . 
  that only works in response to a comment that has already used the interrobang . 
  how would you refer to the interrobang in an unambiguous way without context ? 
   without writing out any of the actual system, 
  this is the crux of it , imo . 
  the system itself is a great one and bringing it over is a perfectly good idea . 
  but it needs a thorough explanation , because it 's not a mechanic that * already * exists in the game , so it needs to be explained so that people can clearly understand exactly how it works . 
  ## overall score : 9.0 / 10, 
  ### overview :, 
  wow , this handbook is epic . 
  / u/jonoman3000 clearly put an immense amount of work into it , and it shows . 
  not only is it 46 pages of content , it 's content that all sticks quite strongly to a unifying theme , and all of the content is very well crafted . 
  beautiful presentation , very well balanced with only a few exceptions , and overall manages to be both the longest and one of the highest quality pieces of homebrew available for d&d 5th edition . 
  to anyone who likes the basic theme , i would highly recommend giving this a look . 
  ### wording/formatting : 9.0 / 10, 
  the visual design of this document is absolutely stunning . 
  i can find absolutely no fault with it . 
  beautiful and relevant artwork integrated into the document in a completely appropriate manner . 
  just to look at , it is indistinguishable from the best work put out by wizards of the coast . 
  in terms of its wording , it is also excellent . 
  very few grammatical or punctuation errors . 
  one that did stand out as particularly amateurish compared to the rest of the document was the use of a hyphen-minus ( `` - '' ) when the intended character was an em dash ( `` -- '' ) . 
  this problem is repeated throughout the document , which is rather disappointing . 
  the college of the shadowfell uses the word `` gleaming '' where `` gleaning '' would be more appropriate , and says `` inclined to creating '' instead of `` inclined to create '' . 
  the use of `` 5 x '' rather than `` five times '' comes across as unprofessional . 
  night domain says `` moon goods '' instead of `` gods '' , and the circle of twilight has `` sect of druid '' instead of `` druids '' . 
  there is a missing full stop at the end of the deathtouched * possession * feature . 
  * cruorwhip * lacks a full stop at the end of its first paragraph ( at the bottom of the page ) . 
  i might also suggest that it specifies that the bonus action can be used * for the duration * of the spell . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9.5 / 10, 
  there are a lot of references to specific gods and powerful entities in this handbook . 
  and that , to be honest , is not something i 'm a fan of . 
  they are not typically listed as being ( for example ) `` a god of death , * such as * ... '' , but are instead simply stated . 
  although it may not be the intent , it makes it feel like these are a little too strongly tied to one specific setting to be appropriate elsewhere . 
  the background of the shadar-kai is particularly off-putting in this respect . 
  the inclusion of a sidebar about the raven queen is extremely helpful in alleviating this , but specifics such as nerull , letherna , and pluton are still problematic . 
  all of the races , however , are very well written and have a strong , interesting flavour . 
  the majority of the subclasses are similarly extremely interesting . 
  the one that stands out to me as an exception to this is the circle of twilight . 
  thematically , it just does n't feel as interesting to me as most of the other subclasses , given that there already exists a circle of the moon . 
  mechanically , the * features * of the circle of twilight are cool and unique , but the flavour surrounding the circle does n't really tell me why it needs to exist . 
  on a similar note , i feel that while the mechanics behind them are great , the flavour behind the subclasses that utilise blood sacrifices , particularly the * blood knight * and the * way of the bloodied fist * were lacking .
