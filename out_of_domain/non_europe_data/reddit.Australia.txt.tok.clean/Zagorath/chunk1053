  blood magic is such an intensely cool concept , but these just felt thematically bland . 
  they would benefit * a lot * , in my opinion , from a much larger amount of flavour text , and maybe even a few tableaux , like full classes get . 
  it might be possible to weave some more flavour into the abilities themselves as well , but that would be more difficult to pull off . 
  i wanted some sense that this is a truly dark and desperate technique , or an utterly maligned one , but instead it just came across as ... this thing some people do . 
  thematically , most of the spells in this handbook are great . 
  there is an incredible range of really interesting and creepy things that a player ( or villainous npc ! ), 
  can do with these spells . 
  one of the few exceptions to this i feel the need to point out is * dome of night * , which comes across as a weaker version of the * darkness * spell . 
  shorter duration , only dim light rather than darkness , and unable to be moved with a source object . 
  but this spell is truly the exception to the rule , as the vast majority are really , really interesting . 
  i would like to draw particular attention to one of my personal favourite spells contained in this handbook -- but perhaps this is just my soft spot for vampires speaking -- * vampire 's kiss * . 
  it feels like the * perfect * type of spell for a charismatic vampire to have access to . 
  i 'm a little disappointed at its hemomancy implementation , and it would be interesting to see the spell presented as a conventional one , but it is nevertheless really interesting . 
  with regards to beasts , i must confess that i myself am quite conservative . 
  i tend to mostly like to stick to the classic monsters and humanoids , and have little interest in the more exotic weird creatures . 
  my favourites among this particular collection included the archlich , the lost soul , and the shadow elemental , but unfortunately i can not say i am a fan of many of the others . 
  but that is largely a matter of personal taste , and it is clear that there is a strong unifying flavour to these beasts . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 8.5 / 10, 
  there are a lot of separate aspects to this handbook , and in terms of balance , i think it best to provide a few thoughts on each one separately . 
  #### mummies, 
  the mummies in this handbook seem a little underpowered as player options . 
  its standout features are frightening a single enemy once per rest ( subject to a wis save ) , and an unarmed attack that deals a little extra damage and reduces its target 's hitpoint maximum . 
  this later part may at first sound quite potent , but in practice i do n't think it 's likely to be an issue very often , as most opponents are not going to be seen more than once , and a majority of those that do will be powerful enough to have access to * remove curse * to heal themselves . 
  a particular problem is the vulnerability to fire damage . 
  perhaps resistance to necrotic would be a good way to offset this . 
  it * does * already have resistance to poison damage , but that is at best going to offset the lack of clerical healing . 
  the wight is another race that feels underpowered . 
  its only standout feature is that it can summon a zombie once per day , but with a tiny , * tiny * amount of hp . 
  like the mummies , i feel like this needs a * little * more to it to be worthwhile mechanically . 
  #### shadar-kai, 
  much more well-balanced than the other two races , these still come across as underpowered relative to the player 's handbook races . 
  superior darkvision without sunlight vulnerability is an interesting choice . 
  it 's good that these have tended towards underpowered rather than overpowered , but to be well-balanced , all of these races need a couple of small buffs . 
  #### path of blood, 
  ** bloodrage ** feels like quite a powerful ability . 
  it might be okay at lower levels where the damage is likely to be limited to less than 20 per turn , but i fear that it would get far too powerful at higher levels , allowing for * both * guaranteed hits * and * enormous amounts of bonus damage to be dealt by the barbarian . 
  that worries me . 
  damage , after all , is not restricted by bounded accuracy in the same way attack bonuses and ac are . 
  ** empowered ability ** is a really nice feature . 
  very flavourful , some minor mechanical benefit , but mostly about reinforcing the theme of this path , which is great . 
  i very much like the fact that ** blood scent ** specifies how long it takes to use a second time ; this is something that could have easily been overlooked . 
  ** power through suffering ** is likely to worsen the problem of * bloodrage * becoming too powerful , but other than that it seems like a mostly harmless ability . 
  if it turns out that * bloodrage * as it currently stands is * not * a problem , i doubt that * power through suffering * will be a problem , either . 
  #### college of the shadowfell, 
  the proficiencies are great , and ** shadow stride ** also seems appropriately balanced . 
  it 's quite a powerful bonus , but since it uses bardic inspiration , it 's severely limited in how often it can be used , and the opportunity cost is quite high . 
  everything else seems well designed . 
  #### night domain, 
  frankly , ** lunar radiance ** seems strictly better than the light domain 's * warding flare * . 
  it grants advantage to hit them , rather than disadvantage to hit you , but it also does damage , and can be used an equal number of times . 
  everything else comes across as in keeping with the design paradigms for a cleric domain . 
  #### circle of twilight, 
  i thought this was fine , mechanically . 
  i really have no thoughts to add . 
  #### blood knight, 
  reading *** blood price *** reminds me of the recent weapon feats unearthed arcana article , wherein one of the feats allowed the use of a reaction on the player 's turn in order to utilise a feature , to make the two features granted by that feat mutually exclusive . 
  this was met with harsh criticism at the time , and though * blood price * does not make use of * quite * the same mechanic , it feels similarly poorly designed . 
  *** sanguine block *** has the additional problem of being used * after * they are hit , which raises the question of whether or not the player knows the exact roll of what they were hit with , since it works with specific numbers . 
  i have no problems with any of the other features . 
  in fact , i would like to point out ** vigour ** as a particularly well-designed high level feature . 
  #### way of the bloodied fist, 
  like the * blood knight * , i thought that this monastic tradition was very well made with an excellent archetypal capstone . 
  #### oath of the grave, 
  nothing to add . 
  #### shadow, 
  ** severed shadow ** feels poorly written in terms of communicating the features . 
  were it not for the latter features that interact with it , i would have had a number of questions as to what is and is not possible . 
  it 's a great example of `` the exception that proves the rule '' . 
  the initial description of the feature should make it clearer that the shadow can not physically hold objects , or be used to take actions such as help or attacking . 
  overall , however , the * shadow * is one of the best mechanical archetypes in this handbook , i feel , with particularly close attention paid to the format of the features gained at each level among the existing subclasses . 
  #### deathtouched, 
  perfectly fine . 
  #### the archlich, 
  personally , this starts off on a rather strong note with ** arcane invisibility ** , in my opinion . 
  being invisible for basically an entire turn is * extremely * powerful , especially as a first level feature ; this would make it extremely powerful in multiclassing for other casters with larger amounts of spell slots , but is already quite powerful just for warlocks . 
  ** undying resistance ** , on the other hand , is one of the weaker options available for warlocks . 
  while trying to make something that 's equally as powerful as the fiend 's * fiendish resistance * would be a mistake , i do feel that it pales in comparison to even the goo 's * thought shield * , which at least reflects damage back upon the attacker . 
  the slow aging ribbon is nice , but does n't compete with that . 
  ** shared fate ** is a ** fantastic ** feature . 
  aside from the obvious combat use , i can easily see it being used in a sort of game of chicken with an enemy : `` which one of us is going to drop first , hmm ? '', 
  #### school of reawakening, 
  first off , this does something i really like in its attempt to balance the savant feature to have more than one school . 
  someone who takes this is sacrificing the gold benefits for an increased flexibility in the schools on which they gain the time benefit . 
  the scaling of the other features this school gains is really well handled . 
  initially , the cr of the awakened soul is quite high , relative to that of the player , being cr 1 at level 1 , and it gains a substantial benefit through that . 
  however , its cr scales * very * poorly , capping out at only cr 5 at level 20 . 
  instead , new benefits are added on top of it , such as using it as a bomb , or using it to restore hitpoints . 
  there is one problem , however . 
  i suspect this may have been an oversight on the part of the class 's creator , but the health regeneration gained by ** consume ** is , in fact , * unlimited * . 
  the ** reawaken soul ** feature is limited to once per day , but it only counts as being used if the soul is actually reawakened . 
  this means that after each combat , a wizard of the school of reawakening can gain hp for every creature on the battlefield under the current cr cap , and stop only on the last one to capture and keep the soul . 
  that could potentially be a * lot * of hit points regained . 
  #### school of hemomancy, 
  ** deepen wound ** strikes me as an * intensely * punishing feature , and vaguely reminds me of 4th edition , wherein a great many features would `` proc '' on creatures that were `` bloodied '' , or reduced to below half hit points . 
  this is not a problem , however , it makes sense thematically , and it does not seem too out of line with the power level of other similarly levelled abilities . 
  judging the balance of spells which involve hemomancy is a difficult task , but in general , i am of the opinion that they are quite well balanced . 
  there are too many to feasibly review each spell in depth but to pick out one of the examples that seems as though it is overly powerful , * animate blood * looks like an easy way to get enormous amounts of damage out . 
  a level 6 wizard will have 30 hp , assuming +0 con and taking the average roll , and no extra bonuses to health . 
  this means she can easily weather the impact of 12 or 15 hp lost without even beginning to worry about health . 
  spend that on four or five droplets for a single spell slot , and the wizard now has four or five contiguous turns of being able to do 4d6 damage in a 5 foot radius area for the cost of some throwaway hp and a single spell slot .
