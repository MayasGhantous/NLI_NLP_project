  and how exactly are you seeing through ssl traffic ? 
  it 's actually only 1 m on roads with speed limits under 70 . 
  but i have to be honest , since the new rules came in , i think nearly all cars have given me 1.5 m on every road anyway . 
  i read them just because occasionally you get some great ones , like with shifty jelly . 
  i just want to point out that the entertainer is ragtime , not jazz , and should be played with straight quavers , not swung . 
  the version in that video is a very simple looking one relative to the `` normal '' version , but only you can know how capable you are . 
  personally , i had been playing for maybe 5 years before i learnt the normal version of the entertainer . 
  unparalleled in price , too . 
  if they have to accept a certificate , then that means my first comment was not wrong ... 
  i have to ask , why link to some weird site like that ? 
  the content is simple enough as it is that it could * easily * just be written straight up in a self.post . 
  alternatively , you could have a look at [ the homebrewery ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ ) , which is really easy to use and produces a much nicer looking result . 
  but anyway , to review the actual thing . 
  i 'm not a fan of the stacking in secret code . 
  it 's very unusual for abilities to stack in this kind of way at all , and the idea of a very much non-magical ability being able to prevent magical decryption of things that could otherwise be decrypted is a particularly bad one . 
  but that said , i 'm not sure existing spells can decypher encrypted text , anyway . 
  decorum seems * way * too powerful . 
  advantage is quite a substantial boon , and the other similarly levelled abilities add ( or subtract ) no more than the inspiration die . 
  an ability a character gains at 6th level should not be able to completely and permanently negate a level 5 spell like * scrying * . 
  the ability check to negate * detect thoughts * is an interesting idea , however . 
  i might word it something like `` the target of a divination spell to detect what you are thinking '' , but it certainly is challenging to make it clear how it is supposed to function . 
  i think watchful guardian is fine as it is . 
  i assume it would require concentration ( as * clairvoyance * does ) , but if the spell it is being cast with requires concentration , the two would be shared ? 
  it could probably use some wording to clarify this . 
  could you explain why you think rotting fist is powerful ? 
  the vast majority of enemies are never going to be healing at all , so the hit point reduction is never going to impact anything . 
  for those enemies that are going to be escaping and reappearing , * remove curse * is only a third-level spell , so they 're going to easily have access to it ( even if it 's just handwaved behind the scenes ) . 
  the zombie minion takes a full day to appear , and can only be one at a time . 
  the limiter is built in to that : once per day . 
  yeah seriously ... a slow run for me is at about 5:00 , which i think is 12 km/h . 
  i was hoping to take pogo out running once i got a new phone . 
  guess that wo n't be happening . 
  a brisk walk ? 
  it 's 5 minutes per k , which is a pace that a dedicated runner would consider slow while running , but it 's definitely not anything most people will reach while walking . 
  my intent was only to get eggs hatching , so i would n't be stopping to catch pok\u00e9mon except perhaps if a particularly rare one appeared . 
  note , i wrote this up in response to your deleted comment . 
  i skimmed the new one and did n't notice any real differences in it , but just in case any of this is outdated , i thought i 'd let you know . 
   i believe comprehend languages would function to decrypt written codes, 
    this spell does n't decode secret messages in a text ... that is n't part of a written language . 
  i dunno , it seems pretty specific . 
  i think anyone would have a hard time justifying it working on encoded messages . 
  nobody would claim that `` ihr wlioz beunn rdx wadpe dvrx khq aame uos '' is `` part of a written language '' , since that is n't a real sentence in any language . 
  ( side note : small challenge to anyone reading this : decode that message . ), 
  regarding decorum , i see what you 're going for now , and it is quite interesting . 
  i 'm still a little skeptical , and it 's probably a fairly difficult thing to model mathematically since you 've now got an additional variable to account for . 
  but honestly , i still think it 's too powerful just based on the fact that it gives them advantage . 
  it becomes a crazy easy way to just say `` yeah , i 've got advantage on this roll '' . 
  and it 's that * in addition * to proving the d6 ( or higher ) bonus . 
  it becomes an almost guaranteed hit on pretty much anything . 
  getting an 11 or higher ( before adding proficiency or ability mod ) is normally 50 % chance . 
  with normal bi , it becomes 67.50 % , and with advantage on top of bi it 's a massive 88.71 % , while you 've got a d6 bi . 
  if we assume +5 from proficiency and ability mod , decorum results in an over 50 % chance to hit ac ** 23 ** , over ** 80 % ** to hit ac 18 , and over ** 90 % ** to hit your sample target of ac 15 . 
  to hit those same percentiles without decorum you 're looking at ac 19 , 13 , and 11 respectively . 
  yes , there 's the psychological element of `` but what if the first die had hit '' , but the problem is that mathematically it does n't really pan out that way and we have to look at the probabilities as random variables if we want to have any sense of robustness in our critical analysis of the ability . 
  incidentally , this is why i personally believe * strongly * in rolling both dice together when rolling with advantage , and not rolling one die twice . 
  it eliminates that psychological element . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( http://anydice.com/program/9221 ), 
   all bards of 6th level are able to completely negate scrying ** in situations where they feel it 's warranted **, 
  it 's that bolded section that 's the problem . 
  as it 's currently written , this is not the case . 
  it 's an always-on feature which results in them * never * being able to be scryed . 
  it costs no resources , and it requires no attention . 
  my preferred option would be `` when you cast nondetection , the duration is 24 hours instead of 8 hours . '', 
  having it not require a spell slot would , in most campaigns , essentially make it free , since that sort of money becomes mostly useless at mid and high levels . 
  if you want watchful guardian to not use concentration , you should specify that . 
  at the moment it just says it `` functions as per the * clairvoyance * spell '' , which logically includes concentration . 
  otherwise , that does n't seem too bad . 
  regarding the homebrewery , yeah unfortunately it has some major compatibility issues , particularly on longer form material . 
  but for something that 's not even going to fill up two columns it 's never going to have problems . 
  plus , for more complex things , one possible solution is to use it and get something that looks good for you in your browser , then export that as a pdf . 
  a music genre , is n't it ? 
  you 're right that the infrastructure is a natural monopoly . 
  but our wireless networks are an extremely good example of how a single ( or small number of ) infrastructure provider ( s ) can nevertheless result in a strong competitive market through multiple competing service providers . 
  there 's no particular reason i can think of that home internet could n't function the same way . 
  contactless payment ( called `` paywave '' if it 's visa or `` paypass '' if it 's mastercard ) is completely ubiquitous in australia . 
  it 's hard to find a place that takes cards at and * does n't * support paywave . 
  and there 's no pin fiddling , it 's just tap and done , if the price is under $ 100 , which is the vast majority of purchases anyway . 
  i went in expecting to hate leto 's joker , but i was actually really pleasantly surprised by the performance . 
  i still hate the outfit and the tattoos , but i think his performance is pretty good . 
  i loved ledger 's performance too , but i 'm definitely optimistic to see what leto does in the future . 
  i was expecting more or less what we got . 
  i was * hoping * for a more rational plot . 
  a villain whose scale and method fit a covert squad of criminals , not someone who should be a viable threat for a member of the justice league . 
  characters that were fleshed out and capable of eliciting empathy from the audience . 
  characters and their relationships that were a little more faithful to the source material ( in particular , harley and the joker 's relationship is meant to be really abusive . 
  he does n't give a fuck about her and uses her as a pawn . 
  in this , he seemed to love her as much as she did him . 
  though apparently they shot scenes that would have portrayed that correctly , and cut them out of fear of upsetting people . ), 
  it was an * okay * movie . 
  leagues better than mos or bvs from my perspective . 
  but dc really needs to pick up there game in the future movies , because it was still lacking in so many ways . 
  maybe i 've just been playing with the wrong bad guys , but personally i 've rarely ( read : never ) seen healing at low levels in enemies , anyway , so i ca n't see it impacting much . 
  plus they can still heal up to that new lower cap , which , since they 're * probably * taking damage from other sources as well , means they 'll still have heaps of room to heal . 
  the difference with the zombie is that it 's got * tiny * hp . 
  at low levels , it 's going to go down in one hit no matter * who * attacks it . 
  so it 's going to last a handful of rounds at most , and once it goes down , you 've got ta wait another 24 hours for the next one to rise . 
  it 's a tiny boon , albeit a really awesomely flavoured one . 
  these are great , but are they available in a better format ? 
  the current narrow scrolling pane with mostly uninteresting information on the left is a real pain , and i do n't know how one would go about printing these out . 
  look again .
