  zombies raised in this way have only 3 times the player 's level in hp . 
  that 's not going to pass * 10 * until * 4th * level . 
  rotation is about an axis , not a plane . 
  rotation about the axis perpendicular to the screen is the * only * way rotation on a 2d screen makes sense . 
  any other rotation would leave the symbol somehow exiting the screen . 
  edit : rotation of a 2d object can also be about a point , but rotation about an axis perpendicular to the 2d plane is the same thing , in effect . 
  yeah this is correct . 
  it does n't help that they really strongly incentivised the submission of ** lots ** of portals without regard to their quality , and that their submission review process was absolutely bonkers . 
  extremely slow , but worse than that , inconsistent . 
  you had no way of knowing which portals would be accepted , so you 'd just submit as many as you can possibly think of , and inevitably many things which should n't be portals got through regardless . 
  so you get things with bizarre names that make no sense , things that are over 100 m away from where they 're supposed to be , things that were in fact only ever meant to be temporary structures , etc. 
  we 're talking about a rotation , not a reflection . 
  from ? 
  reflection would be from ? 
  reflection is like putting it up to a mirror , rotation is like grabbing it and physically turning it about that point . 
  reflection happens about a * line * in 2d , or a * plane * in 3d . 
  rotation happens about a * point * in 2d , or an * axis * ( essentially , a line ) in 3d . 
  that 's technically correct , but in practice both my comment and yours are correct . 
  i said < 70 is 1 m , the actual rules are \u2264 60 is 1 m. 
  the difference being that , theoretically , if somewhere had a speed limit of 61 km/h , my statement would have them giving only 1 m , whereas the actual rules state 1.5 m. but , since we do n't usually have speed limits between 60 and 70 , both are correct . 
  but yeah , thanks for clarifying that mistake on my part anyway . 
  always good to be technically correct !, 
  yeah , europe is a continent about the same size as australia , but with far * far * more cultural diversity across it than we do here . 
  it 's nearly always going to be a bad idea to try and lump them all into one basket like that . 
  i think the point was actually meant to be `` anyone who decides not to use the citycycle specifically because of how they look has a shitty life '' . 
  i 'm not saying i agree with that ( or i disagree with it ) , but that seems to be what the person you replied to meant . 
  no , you ca n't , because the bikes are * designed * in a shitty way . 
  you 're sitting weirdly upright , the bikes are heavy as fuck , do n't have much flexibility in terms of gear choices , etc. 
  i 'm sure they 've got reasons for it . 
  probably makes them cheaper to build and require less maintenance . 
  but whatever the reason is , they 're still a real pain in the arse to ride . 
   and it gives a reason for the barbarian not to dump int for once, 
  yeah but not really . 
  you can already get the languages you 'd want just from your background , and there 's really very little reason to get more . 
  [ there 's one worse again . 
  edit : also , it turns out [ the most recent xkcd is also surprisingly relevant ] ( http://xkcd.com/1722/ ) . 
  not since i was young enough to have no notion of cringe . 
  ... on android . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  on android we can * already * get google now by , you know , * going to google now * . 
  i want to be able to use this same functionality on my * desktop * machines . 
  cortana is terrible , and os x does n't yet have * any * virtual assistant built in . 
  if i could get everything google now already does on my phone while i 'm on a computer , that would be * incredible * . 
  even if it 's only the non-voice stuff , and ca n't be used to launch applications and do that kind of more advanced functionality , it 'd be great . 
  in chrome on android though ? 
  not exactly . 
  the voice commands part word he nice , but the * really * great thing about google now is all the other stuff . 
  the way it brings relevant information together in one place without you needing to tell it anything . 
  that 's never been in chrome on desktop . 
  it really is quite a weird sport . 
  to me , the weirdest thing has always been the horse jumping . 
  it feels so out of place compared to the rest of the events . 
  i 've often wondered why it is n't cross country riding . 
  the vast majority of questions on there seem to be dorothy dixers , anyway . 
  i do n't know if it 's because mods are removing more challenging questions , or if their hivemind is just downvoting them , but there 's a clear sense that most of the questions on the front page are designed to be easy for them to answer in a way that makes them look/sound good . 
  oh nsw , you so silly . 
  i thought the same , but i looked it up based on the slogan , and it 's los angeles ' metro train system . 
  i do n't know what it is , but it feels to me more like a movie , tv show , or game soundtrack than a piece of classical music . 
  is there another subreddit you could cross post it to for that ? 
  by the way , they did n't `` sell out '' . 
  they 're trying to do the responsible thing by allowing through unobtrusive ads . 
  they have a set of requirements that ads have to meet in order to be approved , such as not being in the middle of content , no autoplay audio or video , etc. 
  if an ad meets those requirements , it can be allowed through . 
  they also charge a fee to large ad providers * on top of * the acceptable ads policy , as a means of revenue for themselves . 
  this allows websites to continue making money if they 're doing it in a responsible and respectful way , as opposed to the more overzealous adblockers like \u00b5block which refuse to allow sites * any * opportunity to keep themselves afloat . 
  is n't that just a regional thing ? 
  australians and british people will say `` vahs '' , americans say `` vaes '' . 
   the later being probably the most difficult sport event to secure, 
  speaking of which , they seriously need to get their act together as far as controlling the crowd . 
  the number of incidents this year with cyclists running in to spectators , or having to suddenly stop or swerve to avoid them , was just crazy . 
  could you link to a few scores that do this ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen it before . 
  i mean , this is the same country that brought us [ milkis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milkis ) . 
  it * really * is n't . 
  i dunno , i 've certainly never heard of that before . 
  the article for milkis links to a japanese drink called [ calpis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calpis ) , but to be honest that looks like a completely unrelated drink -- it 's neither carbonated nor normally containing milk , for starters . 
  my general stance on d&d homebrew is `` unless it 's created and shared somewhere that people can give feedback on it , and the creators have shown to respond to that feedback and make changes to their material accordingly , i refuse to even look at it , because i have no way of knowing how reliable it is '' . 
  thus , i find the idea of paying money to kickstart some homebrew to be utterly bizarre . 
  how can anyone be willing to pay money to back something that has no signs that it 's going to be created in a responsible way with feedback loops ? 
  to make it worse , it 's being created by someone who , as far as i can tell , has n't publicly posted well-received ( or * any * ) material in the past -- if it were , it might be reasonable to overlook the lack of feedback and criticism this particular piece is incorporating into its design process . 
  it 's a nice enough idea , but i would really just suggest people look to / r/boh5e or the more well-reviewed stuff on / r/unearthedarcana if they want new material for d&d 5th edition . 
  do they ? 
  i 'll have to take your word for it as i 've never had calpis ( and , admittedly , have n't had milkis for a few years now ) . 
  all i know is that the description of it from wikipedia is completely different from milkis . 
  the above is pronounced `` oo-yoo '' ( oo as in moon , not as in book ) , just fwiw . 
  not in most english dialects , they do n't . 
  though , in the interest of disambiguating for those that do pronounce them the same , it 's [ u\u02d0 ] , not [ \u028a ] . 
  eh , it 's really a matter of taste ( quite literally ) . 
  personally i could n't stand the stuff when i was living in korea . 
   probably it 's 6-7th draft . 
  at the start it 's effects were very different it 's current form is it 's most restricted and simplified version . 
  i 'm hesitant to nerf it any further , this is an offensive class , limiting it 's power, 
  way off topic here , but i 'd just like to point out that every `` it 's '' in the quoted section should be an `` its '' . 
  english is weird , but `` its '' is a special case where the apostrophe is n't needed to denote possession , since in this case the apostrophe is used to represent a contraction ( of `` it is '' or `` it has '' , usually ) . 
  would it be possible for you to provide in a single , concise location the reasons you believe providing advantage on every turn is justified ? 
  you say it 's worth about +3.2 , but really in the sweet spot where it matters most ( when between an 8 and 15 before modifiers is a success ) , it 's worth more like +4.5 . 
  and i 'm a bit confused about how , even if you say it 's worth +3.2 , the damage output is roughly the same as other similar classes . 
  and what is your explanation for exactly how this is still balanced even with multiclassing ? 
  my go to , along with take 5 of course , would probably be mars from holst 's the planets . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , i was expecting the cat to close it after it got inside , leaving the dog stuck outside .
