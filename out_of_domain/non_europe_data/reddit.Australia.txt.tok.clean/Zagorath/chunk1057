  sorry if i came off a little strong in that comment . 
  but yeah , i do feel quite strongly that any homebrew for 5e needs to be thoroughly vetted for balance because it is * so * easy to put out things that are too strong or too weak , as you 'll see with only a brief visit to forums that * do n't * encourage such rigour , like dnwiki or the dungeon master 's guild . 
  that said , the problem is * vastly * lessened in dm-facing options , since a too-powerful magic item is still okay , it can just be treated as a higher rarity level -- ditto with monsters . 
  and it looks from the kickstarter as though most of the stuff is dm-facing rather than player-facing ( like classes , races , and feats ) , so that 's probably good . 
  to me , it still really should be reviewed because there can be design flaws and things not in keeping with the paradigms of 5e , and it 's always best if the creator 's idea for its rarity/cr matches with what 's actually written , and these can be quite fiddly to get right without a large number of eyes . 
  but yeah , i just had a look at the other stuff you 've put out already . 
  i must say i 'm glad to see people putting out content to support the one semi-official prestige class we 've got so far , because i * really * want to see prestige classes as an idea succeed in 5e : a bunch of the homebrew for them has been some of the best stuff out there full stop . 
  regarding that second paragraph , i see where you 're coming from , but i respectfully disagree . 
  yes , the origins of d&d are in homebrew , but the game is a very different beast today to 30 years ago . 
  people care about balance a whole lot more . 
  and while the base benchmark of how powerful things are is rather arbitrary and decided by wotc , it 's important that new things maintain compatibility in terms of how to balance them with that core material . 
  as for me , i am * always * excited to see people try out a new take on a crafting system . 
  the crafting system already in the game is woefully basic , as i 'm sure you know . 
  so anyone trying to fix that gains a heap of browny points in my book . 
  oooh , either of those would work really nicely . 
  it really is . 
  but what makes it worse is that most people do n't even use the best one available . 
  do n't get me wrong , even the best style of romanisation is terrible , but seeing `` ku '' as the transliteration of '' \ud06c '' just makes me facepalm . 
  i 'd read `` ku '' as more like '' \ucfe0 '' , which does n't help at all . 
  mil-keu is a much better ( but still unhelpful ) romanisation . 
  the main two that would be easy to confuse are japanese and chinese , depending on the context . 
  a lot of japanese looks very `` simple '' , or maybe `` cutesy '' , so if you see that , it 's a safe bet that you 're looking at japanese . 
  unfortunately , parts of japanese also borrow directly from chinese characters , so if the text you 're looking at uses mostly those , it could be difficult to tell . 
  but in general , if it 's rather complicated looking , it 's probably chinese . 
  thai and khmer are another pair that could be confused , but the context you 're seeing them in should make it fairly clear . 
  if it 's in cambodia or specifically about the khmer rouge , it 's probably khmer , if you do n't know , it 's almost certainly going to be thai . 
  thai also looks a little more `` flowy '' than khmer does , in my opinion , while khmer has more zigzags and diagonals . 
  vietnamese uses the latin alphabet , but with a * whole heap * of accents thrown in , and each word ( as in , each set of characters separated by spaces ) is a single syllable . 
  it 's pretty unmistakable . 
  i ca n't really help you outside of sea and east asia , i 'm afraid . 
  i do know that the hindi script has a continuous solid line running above it , always , but that 's the extent of my knowledge . 
  i 'm on mobile so i ca n't easily test it myself , but generally desktop youtube urls are youtube.com/watch?=unique-id , without the / ? # / bit . 
  [ here 's a fairly recent one from / r/dndnext ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 4y0nl0/need _ rping_advice_on_drowlnmonk_6rouge_1 / ) . 
  because it 's not a problem . 
  it 's the standard way chat applications have worked for over a decade . 
  skype prevents the `` you 're still in a call without realising it '' problem by having a little floating windows that appears when you close the main one that reminds you you 're still in a call , how long it 's been , and has a hang up button . 
  something like that would be a good way for discord to solve this , i think . 
  but all of those , save perhaps the standing orders thing , are really quite simple concepts . 
  sure it 'll take people a little while to get used to , but if you 've identified the problem areas , it should be super simple to explain how to approach them . 
  if people ca n't be bothered putting in a little effort into learning the rules , why bother ? 
  why cater to them ? 
   my ideas for simplification, 
   - allow amendments only in consideration in detail , so it goes 2 ( do you like the general idea of the bill ) -  amending -  final/3rd reading, 
  i like this , but i thought that 's how it already was . 
   - remove motions/bills by leave/suspending the standing orders , there isnt exactly a huge backlog , most motions put through that system is non-urgent, 
  why ? 
   - remove closure, 
  why ? 
   - remove the right of reply , automatically start voting upon expiration of debate, 
  sounds reasonable . 
   - if no amendments submitted during the cid no 3rd reading , the house has said it likes the bill and doesnt want to change it , so its a pointless stage that adds bureaucracy, 
  sounds reasonable , so long as there is emphasis on * submitted * . 
  if some are submitted but fail , people who supported those need a chance to vote against the bill as it stands . 
   - instead of question time introduce a pmq-style system like irl, 
  but irl any member can ask any minister a question . 
  the difference in this system is that we also allow the public access to question time , to allow more participation in an otherwise rather contained parliament . 
   - make explanatory memorandums optional, 
  but these are useful . 
   - move all enforced standing orders to one page instead of half model standing orders on one page and the entire standing orders of irl and having to cross reference which are removed at which are superseded . 
  this is difficult because in theory * all * standing orders that have n't specifically been superseded could be relevant . 
  while it would be useful to put the ones that actually come up in a single unified location , this would put a greater barrier in the way of using other standing orders when relevant , as members might then just never even look at the flat list of standing orders . 
  how about the king 's speech ? 
  i 've never heard that before . 
  is that a common thing worldwide or just in a specific geographic region ? 
  it 's level 144 . 
  unless you 've got something better than that , surely you should evolve it ? 
  the funny thing is that when we fence against lefties , we 're actually fighting in the same way that two righties fight , with both swords coming `` across '' the body , for lack of a better way of explaining it . 
  it 's just that we 're not used to it . 
  on the other hand , most cameras are designed to be used with the right eye up to the eyepiece , and can be difficult to use with your left eye because your face ends up blocking heaps of controls . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  what i 'm missing is where you 're getting these damage numbers from . 
  precisely what features of each option are adding what amounts of damage ? 
  the linked page is just a bunch of contextless numbers , which is meaningless . 
  i would recommend hl maths if you think you 're capable of getting at least a 5 in it . 
  your uni may or may not require it , but it 's definitely a good thing to have . 
  if you get the choice , try to do either the statistics or discrete maths option topics . 
   affect unconscious, 
  putting my mod hat on for a second here . 
  could you please edit that link , it 's getting caught in the spam filter , and clicking on it just leads to a `` redirect notice '' page . 
  yes , that makes a lot of sense now , thank you . 
  one thing you 're missing is the second level feature that makes double the same number also crit . 
  that increases the chance of critting by 18/400 , from 9.75 % to 14.25 % . 
  when using that 22.5 % figure for hit chance , along with the increased crit chance , it looks to me like you end up with about a 13 % increase in dpr , ignoring the extra radiant damage mentioned at the end of blade of zeal . 
  when you consider that pretty much the * only * benefit the fighter has is being able to pump out damage , i think it 's a little unreasonable that this does 13 % more damage than it , while also being essentially a half caster and gaining some quite powerful other features through the class . 
  in fact , even if you completely took away the ability of the avenger to crit , it 's still outdamaging the fighter by about 4 % ( 1.225 * 10/11 .75 = 1.04 ... ) . 
  my suggestion would be to approximately halve the number of uses of oath per day , and remove the ability to transfer it upon death . 
  really double down on the theme of this class being someone who chooses their big bad target and can utterly * destroy * that target , but at the cost of being somewhat less effective against everyone else around them . 
  they 've decided * this guy has to die * , and they wo n't let anything get in their way of that . 
  cool thanks , approved . 
  close , but not quite .
