  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4xtgfh/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4xtgfh/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  approximately 104,305 people are named jeff ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jeff ) in the us . 
  but i 'll add on jeffery ( 212,196 ^ [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jeffery ) ) and jeffrey ( 902,775 ^ [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jeffrey ) ) as well , for a total of 1,219,276 people in the united states who might use `` jeff '' as their shortened name . 
  the population of the us is 321,418,820 ^ [ [ 4 ] ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl ) . 
  the probability of any one person being a jeff , therefore , is 0.3793418 % . 
  because of the size of these numbers , i can easily assume this number to be constant and not changing based on how many jeffs i 've already picked . 
  the probability of 1 jeff in a group of 15 is the same as the 1 minus the probability there are * no * jeffs . 
  so 1 - ( 1 - 0.003793418 ) ^ 15 , or 5.5414875 % . 
  not bad . 
  the probability of three jeffs is that cubed , or 0.0170168 % . 
  best case scenario , about 12 % of people are lefties . ^ [ [ 5 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handedness#types ) the probability of none of you being right handed is therefore 0.12 ^ 3 , or 0.1728 % . 
  multiply those two above numbers together , and you get 0.0000294 % , or a probability of 2.98 \u00d7 10 ^ ( -7 ) , or approximately ** 1 in 3,400,000 ** . 
  this is , of course , assuming perfectly equal distributions of everything across the country , and a completely random sampling . 
  these assumptions are likely to be completely false for a variety of reasons . 
  it 's about 1 in 3.4 million . 
  it 's free , it 's user friendly , and it 's * very * not time consuming relative to other methods . 
  what 's it 's lacking is flexibility . 
  and i mean * really * lacking . 
  it can do a few basic things , but to make a really good looking map you 'll want to break out photoshop . 
  it 's very easy to outgrow inkarnate as you start running up against the flaws and constraints of the system . 
  personally , i found working with inkarnate was really helpful in conceptualising how to go about creating a map once i went to photoshop -- on a technical level , exactly how to go about using layers , that is . 
  you can hack out some basic map designs really easily with inkarnate , and it does n't require learning how to use photoshop to make those basic designs look pretty nice . 
  i 'm gon na guess you worked for the abc ? 
  maybe the bbc ? 
  but yeah , it 's really quite interesting seeing how these organisations get perceived by the public . 
  the abc in particular is perceived as being quite left-wing , when every internal and independent review finds them to be very evenly balanced . 
  let 's be honest , how is it * not * ? 
  hahaha !, 
  that analogy is just brilliant . 
  i just uninstalled the facebook app from my phone . 
  i do n't need that shit . 
  sure , i ( reluctantly ) need facebook in general , but constant , 24/7 access by having the app on my phone ? 
  no thanks . 
  i keep the messenger app , but it only sends notifications when someone actually tries to message me . 
  that 's why brisbane gets a separate category from the rest of the east coast . 
  not sure why hobart is separate . 
  because like 90 % of sarcasm is in the tone of voice , and you ca n't represent tone through text . 
   using a binomial distribution when it 's not ( though by happenstance the numbers are big enough that approximation that results is ok, 
  i specifically addressed this ... it 's not `` by happenstance '' . 
  it 's a considered decision and frankly considering the accuracy of the original statistics it would n't even be any more accurate to * not * work with replacement . 
   taking the probability of at least one `` jeff '' and cubing it - has no meaning in the context, 
  that was a stupid mistake . 
  it should be the chance of 1 in 15 times 1 in 14 times 1 in 13 , right ? 
   '' ... the probability of 1 jeff in a group of 15 is the same as the 1 minus the probability there are no jeffs ... '' and '' ... the probability of three jeffs is that cubed ... '' are both incorrect . 
  the second one , sure , but how is the first statement wrong ? 
   what about 2 jeffs , or 3 jeffs , or ... 15 jeffs ? 
  what about them ? 
  i was calculating the probability of 1 jeff , because the aim was to calculate the probability of 3 , not at least 3 . 
   but you did n't calculate the probability of 1 jeff , as explained, 
  except you * did n't * explain it . 
  that 's why i 'm asking . 
   how does that get you to the probability of 3 via cubing ? 
  i 've already said my bad on that one . 
  but thanks for the explanation there . 
  for some reason i have you res tagged as `` followed by north korea ? '', 
  i do n't suppose you 'd know what that 's about ? 
  i have no idea the quality of those other unis , but uq has a pretty strong relationship with boeing , and as the other user said , was involved in that high profile scramjet project a few years back . 
  unis were a really popular location for ingress players because there are a whole bunch of things that would make good portals and a lot of traffic going through them naturally . 
  it also breaks down when the vast majority of people outside of those specifically manufacturing storage devices use gb to mean binary anyway . 
  plus , windows and linux both work on the binary system by default . 
  i seem to recall that there are some circumstances in which the two are mixed , as well , with 1024 bytes to the kilobyte , but 1000 kilobytes to the megabyte . 
  but i might be misremembering that one . 
  it probably does n't help that the vast majority of people talk about measurements in binary . 
  outside of hard drive manufacturers , you 'll usually see the binary convention used , but still with mb , gb , etc. 
  this includes the windows and linux operating systems . 
  among other things , gifs do n't use interframe compression . 
  that is , when you load a gif , you 're loading each frame of the video as if it was a separate still image . 
  with proper video formats , they can do some intelligent things to work out exactly what has changed and how , so you 're only loading essentially the * difference * between frames . 
  imgur 's . gifv or other sites like gfycat guarantee no sound , but have much smaller file sizes and thus faster load times than true gifs do . 
  that 's weird . 
  do you have any idea why ? 
  it 's notated exactly like normal tremolos . 
  you 've got two dotted minums connected to each other . 
  normally with tremolos , the same duration is used on both notes , and each individually is the duration that would be sufficient to fill the whole space . 
  so in 4/4 time , a tremolo that lasts the whole bar would be two semibreves . 
  this is 3/4 , so the correct duration is a dotted minum , which is what it has . 
  psionics are n't magic , and so do n't follow the rules of magic . 
  it states they do n't require verbal or somatic components ? 
  then they do n't . 
  there 's no real issue there . 
  pfft , that 's hilarious . 
  is the long story written up on one of those previous tils ? 
  nah that 's fine i 'm sure i 'll be able to find it . 
  thanks !, 
  star trek was literally the only reason i was desperately looking around for proxies , and it just so happened that they added it to australia 's library right around the time my free trial of borderless internet ran out . 
  tng is just such a fantastic show in really glad they added it . 
  ffs people , this is n't a reddit problem . 
  yes , reddit exhibits it , but only because literally every group of people ever do . 
  go look at the religious fundies on facebook , or the feminists on tumblr , or your local socialist alternative gatherings . 
  they all think they 're far more normal and obvious than they are . 
  it has nothing to do with reddit . 
  dmz, 
  elle menno pee is how i say it . 
  to the americans , outside america we call ( these ) brackets . 
   in new zealand `` the west island '' refers to australia . 
  makes sense , when you consider that most of your population lives here anyway . 
  if 350 million is the number of native speakers of english in india , then the above comment claiming there are more indians than brits , aussies , canadians , americans , etc.
