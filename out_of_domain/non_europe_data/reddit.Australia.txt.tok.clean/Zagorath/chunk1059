  combined is wrong . 
  you 'd only need the usa and uk to beat that number . 
  square brackets . 
  well ? 
  which was it ? 
  hmm , not normally . 
  it 's normally one of those few things like dragon ball z where even those of us who say `` zed '' will say `` zee '' . 
  at least when referring to * the * dmz . 
  might be less true when talking about demilitarised zones in general . 
  the first place i remember seeing it was when someone linked me to a youtube video that collated recent viral videos . 
   the green / labor left vote is around 47 % while liberal alone is only 27 %, 
  that 's incredibly misleading . 
  it 's impossible to consider only the liberal party , because they do n't even * compete * in a large number of seats ( e.g. , the entirety of queensland ) . 
  at the * very * least , about 2/3rds of the lnp 's number should be added to that , since that 's roughly how many lnp members sit in the liberal party room . 
  it 's also not fair to compare * both * the major progressive parties to * just one * of the major conservative parties . 
  labor got 34.7 % of the primary vote . 
  greens got 10.2 % . 
  liberals got 28.7 % , lnp 8.5 % , nationals 4.6 % . 
  a fair comparison would be either 45.0 % left to 41.8 % right , or 34.4 % ( liberal + 2/3 lnp ) to 34.7 % . 
  i mean , either way it reveals that the vote is very close overall , leaning towards the left . 
  that said , i 'm not sure it really matters . 
  what 's relevant is how many seats they get , not the total primary vote . 
  and there were a fair few seats that were * very * close . 
  i do n't know the demographics of those seats , but i would n't be surprised if a higher proportion of younger voters would have resulted in those close seats which went to the coalition ending up in labor 's hands . 
  just a couple of seats swinging the other way would have left us with a labor government right now . 
  the github link on the website does n't work , and you should also alter descriptive text to use forward slashes ( '' / '' ) rather than backslashes ( '' \\ '' ) . 
  the latter is basically never used in english -- in fact i do n't think i 've * ever * seen it used except for file paths on windows , namespace definitions , and as an escape character . 
  it would also be prudent to specify the system requirements : most importantly , what operating system does the user need ? 
  i should n't have to download it before discovering it 's all . exes that i ca n't run on os x or linux . 
  i ca n't comment on the tools themselves , since i ca n't run them . 
  i will say though , that if you can port them to a system-neutral language like java , that would be substantially preferable , as it would allow them to run cross-platform , and would also make creating an android application * much * easier . 
  it 's been 200 years man . 
  let it go . 
  how does it work ? 
  like , will it suspend pdfs ? 
  can i specify certain domains not to suspend ? 
  do you have to specifically reload a suspended tab , or will it automatically reload it if brought to the front ( for example , when ctrl-tabbing through to find the right tab ) ? 
   in the window 's frame, 
  fwiw , it 's called the `` chrome '' . 
  google chrome was named after this somewhat sarcastically , since at the time it had the most minimal chrome of the major browsers . 
  ambuscade is stupid powerful even without multiclassing . 
  also directly show your interest to netflix [ by requesting it here ] ( https://help.netflix.com/titlesuggestion ) . 
  if you 've got a spare spot , also ask for them to add young justice seasons 1 and 2 in countries outside america , where we do n't already have it . 
  yeah that 's the biggest thing this post reminded me of . 
  i have n't studied it in detail ( year 9 in highschool was probably the last time i covered it ) , but it 's always seemed to me that wwi was a lot more morally ambiguous . 
  you did n't have so much of a clear `` this side * is * the good guys '' aspect as you did with wwii , at least in hindsight . 
  reading the propaganda , it all felt a lot more `` propaganda-y '' to me than most wwii stuff does , as a result . 
  make sure to watch it on netflix as much as you can if you 're in the united states . 
  buy the disks if you can ( first-hand ) .

  three minutes . 
  that 's not even a card game . 
  ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ it ? 
  they can still do it , they just announced that they no longer will except on actual bots . 
  literally exactly the same on mac , except substituting command for ctrl . 
  when computers store numbers , the most common format is called two 's compliment . 
  in it , the first digit represents whether a number is positive or negative , and the rest determine the actual value . 
  if it 's positive , you just count in binary as normal , if it 's negative , you have to flip all the bits ( change all the 1s to 0s , and all the 0s to 1s ) , and then add 1, 
  00000001 is 1 , 11111111 is -1 ( it goes to 00000000 , then add one and it 's 00000001 ) . 
  if you have 01111111 , that 's 127 . 
  but adding one to that is just like adding one to 099999 , it causes an overflow . 
  so you get 10000000 . 
  the value of that is negative : -128 , to be precise . 
  edit : the gandhi thing is a reference to the original civilisation game , and it 's actually not * quite * the same thing . 
  his aggression level in the game was set to 0 , but at a certain point ( around the same time nuclear weapons are discovered ) something happens to drop his aggression by 1 . 
  if they were using two 's compliment integers like i described above , this would not be a problem . 
  but instead , they used `` unsigned '' integers . 
  that is , integers where they can * never * be negative . 
  so instead of 0 - 1 going to -1 , it `` wraps around '' to the * maximum * possible number . 
  this meant gandhi would become * super * aggressive . 
  it was a bug in the original game , but it 's sort of become a fan favourite easter-egg in the game these days , and more recent versions have deliberately set gandhi 's attributes so that he 'll use nukes a lot . 
  my `` things learned from runescape '' was the difference between stalactites and stalagmites . 
  also the chemical composition of bronze and steel . 
  that 's different , because it 's two different forms of canon . 
  it 's more like separating 4e and 5e . 
  the difference between homebrew and non-homebrew is more like the difference between fan-fiction and official material in the star wars universe . 
  the greatest thing / r/unearthedarcana and / r/boh5e have going for them is n't a technical thing , it 's a culture thing . 
  both subreddits have a culture that strongly encourages people giving feedback on material , and creators responding to that feedback . 
  when someone refuses to listen to feedback , they get ignored and downvoted . 
  if you do n't have a culture that encourages people to leave feedback ( and it needs to be in a prominent location to make it clear to people considering using this material what the feedback has been ) , or if creators are not responding to that feedback to improve on their creation , then the site is worthless as far as homebrew is concerned . 
  it 's not a completely insurmountable problem , but it is a ** huge ** one . 
  the site currently has a reputation for encouraging bad homebrew , and so people who care about homebrew quality are posting to / r/unearthedarcana instead . 
  to get us to move would require something massive . 
   and if i were to do so , it would n't be some random thing on a wiki ; it would probably be one of the carefully written and thoroughly tweaked homebrews on giant in the playground, 
  i do n't know what that website is like , but i would * highly * recommend / r/boh5e as the number 1 source for quality homebrew content . 
  they restrict submissions and only approve stuff that is deemed by a panel of reviewers to be of sufficient quality , and then provide thorough in-depth reviews of that content on all aspects , including balance . 
  i saw the picture without reading what subreddit i was on . 
  did n't know if it was this one or / r/classicalmemes . 
  you 're right about the first case ( my school , for example , does ib in years 12 and 13 ) . 
  but in the second case you 're wrong . 
  op specifically said the ibdp , as in the diploma programme . 
  it depends on your budget . 
  if you can afford it , i would recommend anything * but * a chromebook , to be honest , for one primary reason : referencing . 
  whatever subjects you 're doing , you 're going to be doing at least a few essays that require sources and a bibliography . 
  this is a ** massive ** pain in the arse to do by hand , and unfortunately all of the online tools are only slightly less of a pain to use . 
  using microsoft word makes things * so * much nicer , and using latex is nicer again . 
  any computer running either windows or macos will be sufficient . 
  again it depends on budget , but i would recommend a mac if it 's a viable option , if only because the build quality and battery life tend to be nicer at equivalent prices , and because the trackpad is much , * much * more usable than others ( meaning you 'll be more comfortable with a mac without a mouse than you would be another pc without one -- very useful in class ) . 
  it depends on your subject , but if you 're interested in computers and programming , a mac becomes even more useful , because it 's a unix-based operating system and most of the typical unix filesystem conventions , and the bash shell , are there .
