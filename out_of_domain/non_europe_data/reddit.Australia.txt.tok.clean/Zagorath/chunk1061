   plenty of americans still perceive lenin as a misunderstood humanist who wanted the best for the public , when he was just as bloodthirsty as [ stalin ] . 
  my guess is that george orwell 's animal farm is at least partly to blame , since it definitely portrayed both old major and snowball far more sympathetically than napoleon . 
  i do n't know about oxbridge , but most uk unis are far more directly about results than the us . 
  they 're still a little wishy-washy in their process compared to , say , australia , but good final results are worth a lot more than in america . 
  not really . 
  it 's about when their content takes money away from the original creator . 
  the biggest complaints are regarding facebook , which does n't allow the rehosters to make money off of videos . 
  gifs shared on sites like reddit are also a major problem that brady has mentioned -- at least when those gifs share the main important part of the video , rather than teasing just enough to make more people want to watch the original video . 
  he recently also got paid by kellog 's in australia to do some ads for their cereal products .

  wait shit , i did n't know he had a new channel . 
  i 've been subscribed to finalcutking for ages , but he basically never puts out videos any more . 
  did n't realise he had just moved elsewhere . 
  that does n't sound like learned helplessness so much as just general incompetence . 
  at least , there 's no evidence presented in that article to suggest it 's specifically because they 've learnt that trying to programme will lead to failure , so they stop trying to learn . 
  but on that note , how does one make it out of a software engineering or computer science degree without knowing enough to do fizzbuzz ? 
  a linked list implementation might be a little harder , but that 's the sort of task i would expect to be a kind of baseline for someone with a degree in softeng . 
  i 'm pretty sure i could have done fizzbuzz before i started at uni , at which point my only experience was doing about the first 4 weeks of an online course in python . 
  all you need is a basic understanding of loops , conditionals , and * fucking print statements * . 
  if you ca n't do that , it becomes basically impossible to do * anything * . 
  how are these people completing assignments and passing exams ? 
  tourists are n't ( or at least should n't be ) the focus of `` most liveable city '' . 
  it should be about saying which cities are the nicest to * live * in . 
  wow they 're out already ? 
  it 's still bloody freezing cold winter though !, 
  the modern kellog 's company is something that its founder would have absolutely * hated * . 
  even ignoring the whole anti-sex thing , he wanted breakfast to be a completely utilitarian practice . 
  he thought it * preferable * if it was extremely dull tasting , and would have abhorred all the sweet sugary cereals kellog 's produces today . 
   very often ... etudes are poorly thought out -- it is still art, 
  one * could * argue that etudes are a particular case in that they * are n't * always going to be art . 
  yes , many etudes ( particularly the more famous chopin ones ) have immense artistic merit , but since an etude is fundamentally about improving one 's ability to play the instrument , it would be possible for a composer to write an etude with no interest in its artistic merit , but * purely * to be about testing the ability of the performer . 
  in that case , i do n't think it would necessarily be wrong to say it 's not art . 
  i think a big factor in what is `` art '' or not is how much its creator wanted it to be seen as art , and therefore to an extent how much care they put in to creating it . 
  if someone writes something only because they want it to be a technical challenge for the performer , and does n't also consider how it * sounds * and how interesting it is to listen to , that might not necessarily be artworthy . 
  compared to being able to gain resistance to nearly * every * attack , or being able to make an extra attack every round , i do think that gaining an approximately 1d10 weapon ( does average 6 damage per hit , worse than 1d12 's 6.5 and 2d6 's 7 damage per hit , not to mention obviously lower max damage ) is an unappealing option . 
  the slight convenience of it being impossible to confiscate your weapons definitely does n't make up for it . 
  maybe if this unarmed weapon was worth 2d6 instead ( 1d6 slashing , 1d6 acid ) , it would be worth it . 
  i 'm not familiar with how unarmed fighting / natural weapons works , though . 
  i 'm assuming that you 're * not * able to use two weapon fighting with them . 
  if you * can * , then this becomes a * very * appealing option even as it 's already written , since you can effectively do 2d6 +2 d4 . 
  i got a message from a party that i * do * agree with politically , but i object to that message for the same two first reasons you posted . 
  soliciting votes from other countries should be banned across the model world . 
  oh awesome , congrats mate !, 
  you probably recognise it , in addition to being a concert piece , as one of the demo tracks included in windows xp . 
  haha yeah , i 'm sure we 've all done that from time to time !, 
  44:25 , a pb by a couple of minutes . 
  edit : that was the time they texted me at the end of the race . 
  i just checked the website and the time they 've given me there was 44:54 . 
  not too worried , since that seems to match up with my gps a bit better , and it 's still easily a pb . 
  but i 'm still curious as to exactly why there was the discrepancy . 
  does anyone know ? 
  damn nice dude . 
  i 'm a 60 kg dude and you still beat me by nearly half a minute !, 
  they were n't running . 
  they were n't even walking . 
  they were standing on the side with condescending and frankly insulting signs . 
  you comment would be far better directed at the vegans than at / u/shootphotosnotarabs . 
  australia and ( i think ) new zealand have it , too !, 
  it 's really quite amazing being ahead of canada and the uk for once . 
  it 's also available in australia and new zealand , fwiw . 
  but anyway , the top level comment specifically added the disclaimer of it being region-restricted . 
  if you think the downvotes are n't purely because of freeloaders who think they have the right to get things for free without any cost , you 're joking . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out if it 's some technical term used in chemistry , or if it 's just a typo -- and if the latter , what the word was meant to be . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  there has been [ an official errata ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ph_errata_1.1.pdf ) released , but it does not mention any changes to awakened mind . 
  would you mind sharing a photo of your inside cover page ? 
  the one that has boring copyright information , the cool little disclaimer , etc. 
  preferably a photo of one of * each * of the books . 
  i 'm not much of a vocal music fan , but i do quite like [ the overture to figaro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0yudt13rbo ) , which i believe was made ( more ) famous by its use in the king 's speech , though doubtless it 's been used in many other films before . 
  beethoven 's 7th , the adagio , plays during the titular speech , and is certainly the most prominent bit of classical music in the film . 
  but mozart 's le nozze ( overture ) is played , as is his clarinet concerto ( 1st movement ) , and there 's at least one bit of one of beethoven 's piano concertos at some point ( though i forget which one or where ) . 
  both of the mozart pieces are in actual therapy sessions , fairly early in the movie , i believe . 
  edit : [ quick youtube search found the clarinet concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjts0gkcrm ) . 
  still looking for le nozze . 
  edit the second : [ here 's the clip of le nozze ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnldbokp_s8 ) . 
  it 's actually diegetic sound of sorts . 
  it 's what plays through the headphones when geoffrey rush records the king 's voice and demonstrates that he can in fact speak just fine if he 's not listening to himself . 
  ok , just saw them . 
  see the bit where it has numbers counting down from 9 ? 
  that represents the printing/edition/errata version ( i 'm not really sure exactly what it is , but it 's something along those lines ) that the book is part of . 
  supposedly , historically it would be done by scratching out the lower numbers in later editions . 
  you have a second printing copy ( the `` communicate '' one ) and a fifth printing copy ( `` speak '' ) . 
  but holy shit , i had no idea they were up to a 5th printing already . 
  wow . 
  i bought my phb over 6 months after it was first released , and it was still first printing , so i assumed they moved way slower than that . 
  anyway , yeah , i guess it must have been introduced in one of the later printings quietly . 
  they probably did n't make a big spectacle out of it since it was really more of a clarification of how things were supposed to be already , rather than a balance change or correction of a blatant error , per se . 
  at least it 's not le sacre . 
  it 's also a dick move to creators of videos that you 're watching . 
  oh my gods i fucking hate that bitch . 
  the ads do n't even make fucking sense . 
  why are you writing `` papers , lots of papers '' during `` finals week '' ? 
  that 's not how anything fucking works . 
  you prepare and/or know spells based * only * on your level within that class , but you * cast * them using a set of spell slots determined by your total caster level . 
  this means that , for example , a level 5 wizard , 15 cleric can cast * fireball * as a 9th level spell if she wants , because she knows * fireball * from the 5 levels of wizard , but has access to spell slots from a level 20 caster . 
  aye , and the more common equivalent of `` ready . 
  aim . '', 
  ( though it would n't be * wrong * per se to use those for bows , too ) would be `` nock . 
  draw . '',
