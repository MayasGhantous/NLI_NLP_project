  edit : homophones, 
  option and command click on os x are used the same as alt and ctrl click on windows , they 're nothing at all like right clicking . 
  they do n't bring up a context menu , instead they modify the click in a concise way to perform a different action . 
  for example , in web browsers ctrl/command open in new tab , while alt/option downloads the clicked link . 
  this video has sent me on a multi-hour browsing spree looking for something i can use . 
  unfortunately , nobody sells throwaway game paper here . 
  [ the cheapest i could find online ] ( http://gamingpaper.com/product/gaming-paper-1-square-singles/ ) would cost $ 40 including shipping ( in fact , * mostly * shipping ) . 
  no thanks . 
  the [ chessex battlemats ] ( http://www.chessex.com/mats/battlemats_megamatsreversible.htm ) are a minimum of $ 23 according to their website , and that 's before shipping , which is probably going to be ridiculously expensive . 
  not to mention they do n't actually seem to have an order form on their site . 
  the cheapest i could find them for locally was over $ 40 including shipping . 
  and i do n't think that even includes shipping . 
  so that 's out . 
  i 'm currently very seriously considering [ the noteboard ] ( http://www.thenoteboard.eu/products/noteboard ) . 
  it 's a rather unusual 89 by 38 cm in dimensions , but that 's still got a short edge nearly as long as the long edge of a3 . 
  it 's only $ 21 including delivery , which is by far the best price . 
  my biggest issue with it is quality . 
  i 've found very few people talking about it , so i just have no idea how good it actually is . 
  i do n't suppose anyone here has had experience with it ? 
  otherwise , does anyone else have some good suggestions for similar products ? 
  the lower fidelity end of the market : i 'm not personally interested in fancy terrain . 
  hey matt , thanks for this video . 
  it 's sent me on a multi-hour browsing spree looking for something . 
  unfortunately where i am , both the chessex battlemats and disposable gridded paper are prohibitively expensive due to outrageous shipping costs . 
  ( the $ 10 pack of disposable stuff costs $ 30 more than that in shipping . 
  no thanks . ), 
  the only reasonably priced thing that i 've found has been [ this thing called `` the noteboard '' ] ( http://www.thenoteboard.eu/products/noteboard ) . 
  my biggest issue is i 've basically seen nobody talking about it , so i 'm wary of its quality . 
  i do n't suppose you 've heard of it or used it before and would be able to speak to its quality ? 
  amazon prime is n't available here , and even if it were , that item says they do n't ship to my location . 
  yeah i 've done stuff like that in the past . 
  for the final dungeon of the last campaign i ran , i went to a local office store and got a printed copy of the dungeon printed on a2 paper ( unfortunately , that meant 5 mm to 5 feet in game , which made for * really * fiddly play , and took a long time to cut out all the little character icons ) . 
  i was mainly hoping for something with the grid pre-made , so that i can spontaneously throw a battle map together during a session as needed . 
  cheers , fixed . 
  how well does it sit on the table ? 
  i saw someone in another thread suggest that it might not , thanks to the way it folds , but there was no response . 
  as a corollary , how easy it is to get blown around by wind ( such as from a fan ) , or to accidentally shift it hard enough to knock minis over ? 
  what 's the quality of the pen like ? 
  does the ink rub out easily ( particularly if left on for a substantial amount of time ) ? 
  have you needed to replace it at any point ( and if so , how often ) ? 
  can it work with a standard wet - or dry-erase marker ? 
  but i think most importantly , what 's the condition of the surface like after it 's been used many times ? 
  does it wipe clean to appear nearly good as new , or does it start seeming duller with shadows worn-in ? 
  [ richard strauss 's eine alpensinfonie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zw9ljzkp4g ) . 
  [ and here 's the score ] ( http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8a/imslp20542-pmlp12189-strauss_-_eine_alpensinfonie__op._64__orch._score_.pdf ), 
  page 90 begins at around 26:49 . 
  what sort of paper do you use for larger things ? 
  like , i know that americans have letter rather than a4 , but i have no idea what the standards are for larger things , especially since letter does n't actually scale properly . 
  i guess part of me had always just kinda assumed americans 'd use a3 and a2 . 
  ditto for australia , unfortunately . 
  they do n't seem to have it :(, 
  what the fuck . 
  yes i did . 
  take another look at my comment , i even specifically linked to that site . 
  sure , the product might only be $ 10 , but they 're charging $ 30 shipping on top of that . 
  no thank you . 
  so there are two competing bills to legislate marriage equality ? 
  that sounds like a bad thing . 
  i worry that supporters of one will object to the other out of spite , when really we need * all * the more left-leaning members to support it , along with a few coalition members crossing the floor , for it to pass in the reps. 
  are there any substantive differences between the two bills ? 
  huh ? 
  got a source on that ? 
  that does n't mesh with my understanding of parliamentary procedure at all . 
  all that needs to happen is the bill needs to pass both houses in the same form . 
   changes to senate voting aimed at eliminating minor parties like the liberal democrats , motoring enthusiasts ( ricky muir ), 
  as much as i think ricky muir did a good job , he * was * elected in an undemocratic fashion at the 2013 election . 
  the changes to the senate voting system were a very definite good thing . 
  no , but it * is * your job to provide evidence for the argument you 're making . 
  if you agree with the argument that the majority of those on welfare would rather be working , you need evidence for that claim every bit as much as people claiming that the majority of unemployed are dole bludgers . 
  first hand experience is meaningless . 
  if you ca n't provide evidence backing up your claim , then stop fucking making it . 
  the other side has evidence from another country , which is n't ideal but it 's better than `` i know a bunch of people who are otherwise '' . 
  `` the plural of anecdote is not data '' , as they say . 
  hi sorry , but quickmeme is actually a banned site on reddit , so your submission has been automatically filtered by reddit 's spam filters . 
  if you could edit that link to point to something more trustworthy , and then let me know , i can approve your post . 
  i do n't know how better they could publicise it than making an official announcement on / r/announcements , / r/changelog , and / r/modnews . 
  karma is n't needed . 
  you just need to add the bot as an approved submitter on any subreddits it 's posting on . 
   climate change is natural , its not proven that man has any part in making it happen, 
  this is just a lie . 
  nothing more than a flat out lie . 
  either that , or the ravings of a deranged moron . 
  or both . 
  most graph paper i 've seen has grids that are far too small though . 
  1 cm is a * large * grid , when d&d usually uses grids around 2.5 cm . 
  it would n't be that exciting . 
  it would be the same as if one was passed and then a year later the other was passed . 
  the second one to pass would supersede the first in any places that they come into conflict . 
  cool thanks . 
  the post should be visible now . 
   basically i feel that marriage grew out of religion , then the government got involved and attached all these legal effects to it . 
  marriage has been a civil and legal arrangement * far * longer than it has been seen as tied directly to organised religion . ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriage#history_of_marriage ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriage_in_ancient_rome ) [ [ 3 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriage_in_ancient_greece ), 
  you can `` feel '' what you like , but that does n't change what is correct . 
  it certainly went through a period where it was a largely religious affair in the west at least , roughly from the late roman empire until mid last century ( to put as broad a timeline on it as possible ) , but both its origins and its modern perception are non-religious . 
  so why should religion get to own the term ? 
  raise as in bring the dead back to life . 
  also `` raise the bar '' as in the common idiom `` to lift expectations '' . 
  what in the hells is the abomination in that picture ? 
  i like it , because it 's a logical rule : if you 've got an enemy surrounded , that is a ** huge ** advantage to you in a fight . 
  i do n't like it , because it makes advantage too easy to get .
