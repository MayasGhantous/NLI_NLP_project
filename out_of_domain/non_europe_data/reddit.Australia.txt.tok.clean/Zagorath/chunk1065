  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hey just a tip , no need to put `` homebrew '' in the title . 
  this subreddit is all about homebrew already . 
  hi sorry , but reddit does not allow link shorteners like that . 
  could you please edit this post to include a direct link , and then let me know so i can approve the post . 
  cool , thanks . 
  the post should be visible now . 
  ditto in aus . 
  dude charge your phone !, 
  for anyone confused , elizabeth windsor holds separate titles that are technically completely unrelated from each other . 
  on australian money , obviously , she appears as the queen of australia . 
  sort of like if i were the president of my local bridge club , and also the president of my local cyclist group . 
  if i were making posters for the bridge club , you would n't describe the person on those posters as `` the president of the local cyclist group '' , because it 's completely unrelated . 
  * so * , *** so *** close , but not quite . 
  mints are where * coins * are manufactured . 
  unfortunately , my googling ca n't find a good answer for what the equivalent is with bank notes . 
   a vote on standing orders, 
  as in , a vote to amend the standing orders ? 
  or just a vote to suspend them ? 
  or is it something else ? 
  two questions :, 
  most importantly , why was dutton missing ? 
  then , what were the 3 votes labor won ? 
  the convention of speaker denison 's rule is far , ** far ** stronger and more crucial than most of the other day-to-day conventions of parliament . 
  if he had gone against that , it would have had * enormous * ramifications for the future of parliament . 
  it would n't have been as showy as the constitutional crisis of ' 75 , but its long-term ramifications would probably have been bigger . 
  bishop was far from a fair unbiased speaker and she ruined some of the integrity of the position -- particularly in her abuse of so94 -- but as far as i 'm aware she never violated the convention dictated by speaker denison 's rule . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't understand what you 're asking for . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  as another commentor pointed out , bishop probably would n't have ever had the chance to show her mettle with regards to this , since her government had a strong majority at the time and ties were therefore not a common occurrence , and even less so on issues that the government really cared about . 
  so , who 's to say what she would have done . 
   i have never read the psion class from previous versions of d&d and as such may or not be relatable, 
  i 'll be honest , this shows , and i really do n't like it . 
  it 's probably perfectly fine for what it is , but psionics has a long history as a core part of the lore and mechanics of d&d ( being probably the single biggest and most important thing in the game outside of those included in the basic phb/mm/dmg books ) , and this deviates too far from that for my liking . 
  first and foremost , psionics is not spellcasting , and writing it up in the format of a spellcasting class does it a disservice . 
  there are also a number of abilities associated with psions that have specific names . 
  removing these is like if you created a wizard that ca n't cast * fireball * or a cleric without * cure wounds * . 
  those spells -- name and all -- are a core part of the expected experience of playing a wizard . 
  mind thrust ( an attack that does damage and may also impose a small temporary disadvantage to the target ) is one that immediately comes to mind . 
  the unearthed arcana `` mystic '' class that wizards of the coast put out is really quite a terrible representation of the classic psion ( which is what it 's meant to be , by their own admission ) in a number of ways , but it gets a few things right , and one is deliberately setting itself apart from standard spellcasting . 
  it 's also worth looking at if you 're looking for a unifying class mechanic , because they did that aspect * really * well . 
  i do really like the archetypes you 've gone for though , and i think the types of abilities you 've given them are great . 
  i 'd * highly * recommend having a look at past edition psions . 
  the 4e one is a really easy one to read over , and did a * fantastic * job of representing the class . 
  but at its most basic , one thing a psion should have is an ability to take a basic cantrip-like ability and `` augment '' it using a resource of psionic power points ( like the sorcerer 's metamagic , but instead of doing extra weird stuff , it 's simply making the ability stronger at what it already does ) . 
  for example , a basic damage attack might do 1d10 damage normally , but you can augment it to do 1d10 extra per power point . 
  this is the bread and butter of the psion , like eldritch blast for warlocks or a sword attack for a fighter . 
  a mind reading attack might get basic surface thoughts for free , and cost power points in order to delve deeper ( or might not even be free to start with -- maybe it 's 1 point for surface thoughts , and 3 to delve deeper ) . 
  having them cast existing spells is okay , to an extent , though ideally it should be kept to a minimum , much like the elemental monk , and should be using a resource like power points , rather than spell slots . 
  unfortunately , this also makes them take a lot more work to create than most other spellcasting classes . 
   in my experience - which is n't always true - vegetarians tend to be a lot more laid back . 
  you 're probably completely correct in the general sense , though the one vegetarian i know quite well is * really * uptight about it , and the only vegan i 've ever talked to about veganism was * really * casual about it . 
  just thought it was interesting . 
   i 'm from texas , which is n't the south ,, 
  wait , what ? 
  i always thought texas was the * definition * of the south in america . 
   many redditors are happy commenting on niche subreddits about things that actually matter to them . 
  this is me . 
  i just do it a fuck load , and that plus the occasional really lucky comment , and it 's really quite easy to get into / r/top or cc without meaning to . 
  i 'm left eye dominant and somewhere ambidextrous , cross-handed , and left handed ( normally identify as ambidextrous ) . 
  i 've heard having matching dominance is an advantage in shooting , but i have n't done very much of that so i would n't know . 
  and i would n't be surprised if it also helps a little in fencing , though to be honest i have n't noticed that much ; it is hard to know if something 's an advantage or not if you can never experience the opposite , though . 
  as a side note , are you from a commonwealth nation ? 
  i mainly ask because you put bowling and batting next to each other , which would seem to imply cricket , rather than tenpin bowling and baseball , which is what most americans would normally be talking about . 
  as a second side note , being left eye dominant is a * pain * if you 're a photographer . 
  your whole face ends up blocking some of the buttons on the back of the camera , since it 's designed assuming your right eye will be at the eyepiece . 
  slightly off topic , but since a subreddit about the office is trending , has anyone here seen the new david brent movie ? 
  i 'm wondering what it 's like , as a huge fan of the original show . 
  you seem to know what you 're talking about , so i 'll ask here , what exactly is wrong with the bubble bursting ? 
  i mean , bubbles bursting are obviously considered by most economists to be universally disastrous for the economy in the short term , but why is that ? 
  and , from a purely self-interested perspective , could the bubble bursting be * good * for some people ? 
  if someone 's in an economically sound position where they have a well-payed job that wo n't be affected by any crash ( or they just have large amounts of assets available ) , would the `` despair '' phase be a really , really good time to invest in the market , since you know it has to return to normal eventually ? 
  buy in just after it 's making a recovery from a point well below long term averages ? 
  that would be utterly useless for the vast majority of us who * do n't * play through those websites . 
  a pdf is a universally accessible format that anyone can use and search . 
   because i hate acronyms, 
  in the first page of your user profile as it is right now , you used acronyms ( or initialisms , if we 're being technical ) 6 times , in 5 unique ways , not counting quotations and file type extensions . 
  for someone that `` hates acronyms '' , using one in one out of five comments is rather a lot . 
   sol, 
  you mean `` the sun '' ? 
  because that 's the official name of the star we orbit . 
  star trek made up that latin name for it , scientists do n't use it . 
  technically not public domain per se . 
  it was only proven that whoever used to hold the rights legally did not have a claim on it . 
  * theoretically * someone else could come along and prove that they should own it . 
  in practice though , you 're right , it can be treated as public domain . 
  yeah , and its worth to literally everyone else is exactly nil . 
  hey , this file says `` you need permission '' . 
  you 'll need to click `` share '' in the top right corner , and then `` get shareable link '' to make sure everyone can see it . 
  cheers, 
  no , i mean star trek is who made up the application of the latin name as if it were the scientific `` correct '' name . 
  which it is n't .
