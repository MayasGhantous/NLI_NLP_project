  they 're perfectly fine abilities , but calling them ribbons is doing them a disservice . 
  personally , i think these overall are far more `` lacklustre '' than the ones from the phb and dmg . 
  the increased damage resistances are far less interesting than the ability score increases . 
  in general though , there 's also a certain extent of these potentially being too powerful thanks to that wide variety of damage resistances that they each get . 
  in general , it 's best to keep races gaining a wider spectrum of minor increases , rather than a large number of increases in a small area . 
  this helps decrease the potential for min-maxing . 
  it 's also best not to deviate from the +2 and +1 standard without a particularly good reason . 
  as far as i can see , you 've dropped them by +1 ability score , but given them an additional pair of damage resistances and a skill proficiency . 
  they 're objectively better than the already quite acceptable races , which is a problem in itself . 
  and yet it seems to be deviating from the norms of race design seemingly * solely * to justify this . 
  personally my ruling on bucklers is +2 ac against melee attacks * only * , and nothing against ranged . 
  ysk this is a dick move because it means that you 're depriving all of the creators whose videos you 're watching of their chance to make income off their work . 
   i really hate intersect morgan though . 
  i hated it on my first watch , but in retrospect i think it was important . 
  it probably could have been executed in a slightly less cringey way , but it was necessary to set up the memory loss effects of the intersect . 
  in chrome , at least , you can block all plugins without needing a script . 
  it 's a feature of the browser . 
  can temporarily or permanently enable for a website , too . 
  javascript is n't a plugin , so preventing it from running is the only actual reason to use noscript . 
  for video ads it 's if they watch 30 seconds or the whole ad ( whichever is shorter ) , or if they `` interact with the ad '' , which means clicking on the link to the advertiser 's website . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( https://support.google.com/displayspecs/answer/6055025?hl=en ), 
  for overlay ads , they count both impressions ( they number of people shown the ad ) and clicks & click-through rates ( the number and percentage of people who clicked on it ) . 
  the latter are obviously worth more , but even just seeing it is worth something .

  unfortunately you ca n't tell them exactly what you want to see , but thankfully op 's tip * should * ( over time ) make them stop showing you things you 've specifically told them you 're not interested in . 
  okay this is at least the third time i 've seen people talking about `` peaches '' in their title . 
  at first i thought it was some creator 's nickname , like wh for walrock , but i 've noticed different people all using it . 
  what in the hells is going on ? 
  your kid 's name is lips ? 
   abbott returning is retarded , and it 's pretty fucking childish all the people here who hope he gets back in to fuck up the nation just so the libs do n't win an election . 
  that 's the thing , he 's not going to he able to fuck up the nation . 
  not with the narrow reps majority and the complete cluster fuck of a senate he 'd have to deal with . 
  besides , the coalition is going to put through more or less the same legislation whoever 's in charge . 
  them changing leaders is going to do little to change that . 
  what it * will * change is public perception , and anything that will increase the odds of the next government not being a coalition one is a good thing . 
  and what are the reasons that you * would * love to vote them ? 
  proper link here :, 
  the issue comes from the fact that you linked to a non-existent subdomain . 
  the np * replaces * the www , not goes next to it . 
  www.np.reddit.com is n't a real thing , so it wo n't let you go there . 
  those are n't apostrophes , they 're single quotes . 
  we just use the same key for them on computers - much like how we use the hyphen-minus key on the computer to represent hyphens ( joining words together , such as in ` sugar-free ' ) , the minus symbol ( in maths ) , and both em and en dashes ( em dashes are used for parentheticals , like i used above , after ` computers ' , and more properly look like this : ' -- ' , en dashes are used for ranges , like 1980-1985 , and more properly look like this : ' -- ' ) . 
  in certain technical fields the distinction matters , but in general writing , either single or double quotes are perfectly acceptable , and can be used interchangeably . 
  whichever you use , you should use the * other * one for quotes inside of quotes . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation .

  one thing i 've always found interesting is that in french , you play * at * a game or sport , but you play * of * an instrument . 
  `` je joue * au * football , mais je joue * de * la clarinette . '' do other languages have something similar ? 
  my best guess , from a quick glance , is that [ this thread ] ( / r/skyrim/comments / 514g41/imperial _ or_stormcloak / ) made the front page . 
  / r/dndgreentext is another good one , particularly [ their hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  but anyway , do you have any friends that might be interested ? 
  it 's super easy to get the books online , and once you 've got them you could run the game yourself for those friends . 
  if you wanted to , you do n't even need all the books . 
  the starter set comes with a basic handbook included , as well as a really great starter adventure , and a set of dice and some premade characters . 
  you 're not the only one . 
  the subreddit is just a shithole that scares away anyone who is n't interested in blindly hating on everything they do . 
  try / r/cwarrow for a slightly more rational point of view . 
  play the first four ascending notes of elfman 's batman theme right at the end there , but do n't resolve down to the fifth . 
  it would be such an awesome moment . 
  hey , has the bot been down for a while ? 
  i did n't get a notification from [ this comment ] ( / r/dmdadjokes/comments / 513py3/longi _ once_spent_two_and_a_half_months_setting_up / d79i71v ) . 
   this is n't exactly `` green text , '' but someone on r/dmdadjokes thought you might enjoy it . 
  they were n't wrong !, 
  but yeah , the greentext thing is only a guideline , not a rule . 
  you 're absolutely fine posting great stories here regardless of their format . 
  if you want things to appear as hashtags , you need to ` escape ' the character . 
  reddit 's markup language interprets hashes at the beginning of a line as headers . 
  you can escape it by having the line start with a backslash , which basically just says `` i want this to be an actual hash , not part of the markup '' .

  oh nah mate , i 'm completely with you there . 
  i stay away from trailers and such like the plague . 
  at the professional level union is a farce . 
  the ref pulls them up for every little thing and the game loses every advantage it 's supposed to have over league . 
  i fairly recently watched some university level union games and only then did i realise why people actually like the sport . 
  when the ref is a little more lenient the game flows amazingly and some really cool plays happen . 
  you 're in a thread about an aussie sport mate . 
  we 've got your back on this one . 
  it 's soccer . 
  international football is an actual sport . 
  it 's a fusion of australian rules football ( the game being ` played ' in this post ) and gaelic football . 
  the two a similar enough that with some tweaking an international game can be made where they play each other . 
  it really is n't . 
  there 's hardly any resemblance between the two , really . 
  to be fair , it 's just about the only sport where players are regularly expected to score from around about 50 m out , too . 
  edit : ducking autocorrect, 
  international football is actually [ something else entirely ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_rules_football ) . 
  edit : removed mobile link . 
  i 'm wondering if perhaps you 're skipping a harmonic somehow , going fundamental , 2nd harmonic , 4th harmonic . 
  is it possible to get an a in the second octave by fingering a d ? 
  possibly by trying to blow half way between 2nd and 3rd octaves ? 
  oh awesome thanks , that 's exactly what i wanted . 
  i loved summoner as a kid !,
