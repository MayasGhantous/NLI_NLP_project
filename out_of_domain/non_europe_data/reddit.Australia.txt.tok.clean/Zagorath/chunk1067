  did n't even know it had mixed reviews because i was too young to be looking at reviews . 
  it 's available on pc now , too !, 
  both [ steam ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/275570/ ) and [ gog ] ( https://www.gog.com/game/summoner ) have it . 
  on both of those its reviews are pretty damn good . 
  78/100 on metacritic , steam says overall `` very good '' , and gog has it on about 4.5 stars . 
  you googled those other things specifically for the screenshot , did n't you ? 
  you wan na justify that claim ? 
  he got hired by kellog 's to do a couple of ads in australia . 
  i would n't be surprised if he 's had other business of that sort .

  i do n't know of * any * exclusives it had that even come close to the ps2 + ps1 's exclusives . 
  spyro , dark cloud , final fantasy x , kingdom hearts the jak & daxter series , and the ratchet and clank series , to name some that immediately come to mind . 
  xbox had ... halo , i guess . 
  but you ca n't even really count that , since the first game was on windows and os x , and the second was on windows . 
  damn it you !, 
  # overall score : 7.17 / 10, 
  ## wording/formatting : 6.5 / 10, 
  the fonts produced look a little ... chunky , i guess ? 
  particularly in the headings . 
  it 's hard to describe , but they look slightly off . 
  it 's not a huge deal , but it does make this a little less pleasant to look at . 
  the lack of pictures is a far more serious issue , though . 
  the mer described in this do n't match at all with what people usually think of , and a picture would be * extremely * useful in clearing up the confusion at a glance . 
  there are also a few awkward sounding wording decisions . 
  no clear grammatical errors , but it just does n't flow particularly naturally . 
  another more minor point is that it repeatedly capitalises the name of the race . 
  race names are not typically capitalised . 
  ## creativity : 8/10, 
  it does n't conform to the usual assumptions of mer , and for that reason i feel that this has perhaps been mis-named . 
  a new name would shed the baggage associated with mer from classic literature and typical d&d . however , it * is * a very interesting and well thought-out race in its own right . 
  from the history and origin to their current personalities and architecture , it 's just oozing in interesting content . 
  it does , however , lack a racial quote , which could have been a really great way for the author to have shown off a bit more of the culture and history associated with this race . 
  ## balance/mechanics : 7/10, 
  i feel that this is a little over powered , but might be okay depending on the campaign . 
  they get their standard +1 / +2 , darkvision , and two languages , as well as the obvious swim speed and ability to breath in water . 
  each of them gets a pretty highly useful cantrip , and resistance with one of the rarer damage types . 
  the aboleth additionally gains a skill proficiency -- perhaps to make up for their resistance being even less useful overall than the kraken 's . 
  it 's an enormous amount of abilities , but thankfully none of them go too deep into one area , which is a definite mitigating factor in the strength of the race . 
  the biggest issue is with how much one values those water abilities . 
  if one places a high or moderate value on them , this race is probably overpowered , if not , it could be okay . 
  ignoring the swimming stuff , the base race is worth about +2 , and the subraces are worth about +3.5 and +4 , respectively . 
  i 'd probably say the swimming stuff is worth approximately +1.5 or +2 , but it 's * highly * dependent on the campaign and the setting , so it 's difficult to just take the numerical figures and make conclusions out of them . 
  i do wonder why they have a full 30 ft. walking speed , but a 40 ft. swim speed . 
  in terms of logic it seems to me either they have tails and thereby gain massive swim speed by sacrificing walking speed , or their have webbed feet in which case their swim speed is probably not * that * fantastic , but their walk speed does n't suffer as much . 
  the use of constitution as the spellcasting ability of the kraken merfolk 's ink glands ability is really cool . 
  unlike most other times i 've seen con used as a spellcasting ability , here it really makes sense thematically , and adds something interesting to the race . 
  ## overview :, 
  it 's a pretty good race . 
  it could use some tightening up on its writing , and would benefit from a racial quote to expand upon its lore . 
  but honestly , i feel the biggest thing this could do to improve itself is to add some art . 
  it 's also probably a little overloaded with features , but it 's certainly not so bad as to make me want to throw it out entirely . 
  it stretches just beyond what i 'd consider acceptable design , but it 's not so far gone that i 'd consider it unplayably strong . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  thanks . 
  really ? 
  i mean , it 's fairly clear that there 's at least * some * degree of consistency to them . 
  the 330 , 333 , 340 , and 370 all go from the city north to ( and in some cases beyond ) chermside . 
  the 402 , 411 , and 412 all go in the uq -- toowong region . 
  all it takes is a fairly cursory look at things to see that there 's probably * some * meaning behind them , even if it is n't exactly clear * what * that meaning is . 
   if it ends in a 0 or a 5 , its a mainline route down an atertial road, 
  this does n't apply in the 4 range , apparently . 
  the 412 is the main route from st. lucia to the city , for example . 
  [ my google ] ( http://railbotforum.org/mbs/index.php?topic=11450.0 ) seems to think it 's a particular artefact from a time when all routes were only 2 digits . 
   you draw a 9 in a clockwise manner, 
  you do ? 
  i do n't . 
  i draw an anticlockwise circle and then a line . 
  like an `` a '' , but the line goes down further , and the circle is higher up relative to the base line . 
  or a `` g '' if the tail was n't curved . 
  uhh , you might want to edit this to put a backslash ( \\ \\ ) between each of the numbers and the full stops . 
  reddit 's markup converts each of them into an ordered list * starting * at 1 , regardless of the number you chose , so you 've ended up with, 
  stuff, 
  more stuff, 
  stuff, 
  more stuff, 
  stuff, 
  but by writing ` 1 \\ . 
  stuff , 2 \\ . 
  stuff ` , etc. , it 'll display correctly and people can actually read what you intended . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  the quest sounds like the first bit of lost mines of phandelver , so you 're probably playing 5e . 
  the dvorak ( which should be typed like that , by the way , not all caps -- it 's named after a person , as opposed to qwerty which is named after the literal letters on the top row ) [ simplified keyboard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kb_united_states_dvorak.svg ) is * really * bad for one-handed typing . 
  the one with aoeu htns in the home position is designed to evenly split the typing up between the hands . 
  there are two other keyboard layouts called the [ left-handed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kb_dvorak_left.svg ) and [ right-handed dvorak layouts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kb_dvorak_right.svg ) , which are designed to be typed with only one hand . 
  there 's very little transferability of skill from the standard dsk to the one-handed variants . 
  the stress of having lots of work gets you to do more work , mike ? 
  wow i 'm jealous . 
  when i have a lot of work i end up getting super stressed and then procrastinate doing * anything * until the very last possible moment ... 
   looking back at one 's work is actually useless absent the critique of another party . 
  as the artist , one is too close to the work to properly criticize . 
  maybe acting is different , but i can definitely say that given a large enough chronological gap between creating the work and reviewing it , it 's very easy to give a pretty honest critique of one 's own work in other creative fields . 
  it 's not going to be as useful as having another party helping , but it 's still quite useful . 
  i 'm using the exported pdf linked in another comment in this thread . 
  no we do n't . 
  donkey votes are when you vote in the order on the ballot , voting 1 for the guy who got lucky enough to be at the top , 2 for the next guy , etc. 
  for president you do n't have that luxury . 
  and in most house and senate races you probably do n't either . 
  unless you guys choose to switch to a non-retarded voting system , having first past the post means the only rational choice is to vote for your preferred out of the democratic and republican candidates .
