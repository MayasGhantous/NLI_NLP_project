  that 's how i feel about tv viewership ratings as well . 
  i would point out another recent example . 
  the last uk general election , the polls were expecting a close race . 
  nobody was quite sure who would win . 
  come election day , the conservative party won in a * landslide * . 
  clearly the polls had some problems . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 504won/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 504won/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  your link there has been automatically removed by reddit 's spam filter , and to be honest i 'm not inclined to take the risk of following it . 
  could you please reupload that to a more trustworthy host ? 
  i had never used blutooth until around december last year . 
  to be honest , i was * very * unimpressed with the experience . 
  i would frequently find the beginning of sentences ( in audiobooks and podcasts ) would be cut off -- as much as a word and a half could be lost , forcing me to guess at what was said or even worse have to rewind -- and the audio would stop entirely if i went around a corner to go to the toilet while leaving my phone on the bed . 
  not to mention it only lasted a couple of hours at most before * yelling * at me that it needs to charge . 
  and switching from my ( mac ) computer to my ( android ) phone was a huge amount of work compared to unplugging from one and plugging in to the other . 
  i certainly do not expect to be switching to wireless primarily any time soon . 
  3 years `` what this guy said ^ '', 
  i 'm neutral on them . 
  this clip was kinda funny i guess , but i did n't think it was anything special . 
  i 'm not a fan of prank calls in general . 
  i would n't say i ca n't stand them , but i would n't say i love them either . 
   with day and night there is a clear difference, 
  not really . 
  at what point does day turn into night ? 
  it 's still light out when the sun dips below the horizon , so that does n't seem a good point . 
  indeed , [ we do actually have technical definitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:twilight_subcategories.svg ) , but there 's no hard cutoff from `` day '' to `` night '' . 
  instead , there are varying degrees of `` twilight '' in between the two . 
  and exactly where those various degrees lie is an arbitrary decision anyway . 
  similarly , ring species like the greenish warbler demonstrate they grey zone in our definitions of species , even once you take into account viability of offspring . 
  both `` day and night '' and `` species '' are useful concepts . 
  but you can not claim that one is precise with `` a clear difference '' and the other is not . 
  yeah it 's a real / r/titlegore . 
  i 'm having trouble parsing it myself . 
   or any way you can all access the same folder, 
  dropbox would work , would n't it ? 
  it was n't ? 
  or if it was , it has since been put back . 
  it 's down to 4th in / r/videos now , though . 
  to save you the risk of getting caught in a tv tropes hole , yes , ned flanders from the simpsons is the trope namer for `` flanderisation '' , which is a term for `` the act of taking a single ( often minor ) action or trait of a character within a work and exaggerating it more and more over time until it completely consumes the character '' . 
  ned flanders was originally just a decent guy . 
  a nice neighbour to the simpsons and father to his kids , who just happened to be a devout christian who enjoyed going to church -- as a contrast to homer . 
  only later on did he become overly obsessively religious `` to the point of being an utter jackass '' . 
  got any links ? 
  he 's done optus ( one of our biggest telcos ) ads here in australia , and they 're pretty damn brilliant . 
  not every uk show `` is very good throughout but very short '' . 
  dr who has been running for so long that nearly 100 episodes are * missing entirely * and that 's still only a fairly small fraction of them . 
  i have n't watched the modern show , but from what i 've heard of fans of it , it is n't anywhere near the same quality now as it originally was . 
  downton abbey is another one that became very popular outside the country , but it quite quickly lost its appeal as it became more soapy . 
  plus there are probably countless shows that those of us outside the uk just never hear about because they 're not good enough to catch on . 
  most people use google drive . 
  a few use dropbox , though it can be quite slow . 
  i think i 've seen scribd used before , though it 's another one of those not so great sites . 
  it is at least a well-known and established host . 
  i 'm not referring to the * whole * of the modern show , only the last few seasons . 
  people who were fans of the david tenant and early matt smith episodes do n't seem to like the later smith and the current doctor episodes . 
  cool thanks . 
  the post should be visible now . 
  good ol' muphry 's law . 
  i do n't think i 've ever gone from `` that sounds like it could be a cool place '' to `` wow , what a bunch of nuts '' faster than looking at / r/edc . 
  why do so many people consider a knife something * essential * to carry with you * daily * not even to mention a gun , which is just getting into cartoonish levels of stupidity . 
  uh , do you perhaps mean accuracy vs * precision * ? 
  both involve errors . 
  high accuracy means reducing * systematic * errors ( errors which are some consistent amount wrong -- whether it be by a constant , proportional , or some other function of the variables involved ) , while high precision is about reducing * random * errors ( errors that deviate randomly in scale and or direction from the correct value ) . 
  i always like to read the wikipedia article about the piece before i go to a concert , unless it 's something i 'm already * very * familiar with . 
  it 's nice to get a feel for the different themes in a piece , what they represent ( if anything ) , and how they are used within the form of the piece , so you can mentally follow along as you listen . 
  for me , that makes it a lot more enjoyable an experience . 
  youtube analyses or edutainment videos can also be worthwhile , when they 're available , if only because of how they 're interesting for their own sake . 
  for example , [ this video with leonard bernstein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1klmxuer8 ) goes over the first movement of beethoven 's 5th and looks at some discarded sketches beethoven wrote , and explains why he did n't use them , which in turn can give you a bit of insight into the piece as it stands today . 
  not if you 're using a vpn . 
  also interesting is that , even without a vpn , your isp wo n't know what * pages * you 're visiting . 
  they 'll know the * site * , thanks to dns requests and ip destination headers , but the actual * page * details are , if you 're visiting a site with ssl/tls encryption ( i.e. , there 's an `` http ** s ** '' in the url ) , hidden from anyone but you and the server , provided you have n't installed a malicious root certificate . 
  and i 'm asking what the hell you mean by `` error '' . 
  integer division by default and nice print statements are pretty decent reasons to start people out on python 2 . 
  i 'd agree with that argument if it did n't already have ` return ` and ` yield ` . 
  conceptually , it 's very easy to think about the most basic output of text to a screen as being in the same class as returning from a function , particularly for a beginner . 
  because that 's how most every day programming languages ( in particular , the c family and java ) handle things , and i think python is the ** perfect ** introductory language . 
  it 's best to get people used to the normal behaviour as soon as possible . 
  my website is n't a portfolio , and if it were , my current solution probably would n't be adequate , but i host out of my own house . 
  my isp gives me a static ip , so i just use my registrar 's dns to point here and it works fine . 
  only myself and a few friends use it so there 's no performance issues or anything like that . 
  it 's good because it provides an opportunity to teach specifically * about * those things so that they are already familiar with them when they move to c or java . 
  coffee shops at stations make fine sense . 
  you can grab one after your final stop on your way in to work . 
  but also , not every train goer is commuting , and if you 're travelling outside peak hours , it 's perfectly normal to arrive early enough that you 've got time to get a drink and finish it before getting on . 
  no , it was phrased just fine . 
  the `` the '' made it clear that you were referring to spore , and not in the general sense . 
  i made my own layout that i call `` coder 's dvorak '' , based on the existing programmer dvorak layout . 
  i 've installed it on all my computers and it 's what i use when programming . 
  my [ `` coder 's dvorak '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgphjcl.png ) is aimed to make c-like languages easiest , with a secondary interest in languages that use a dollar sign for variables . 
  note that all the letters are in the same place as dvorak , as are the most common punctuation marks ( apart from quotes and semicolons switching , like in programmer dvorak ) , while making programming-important symbols , like braces , square brackets , brackets , common arithmetic symbols easy to reach . 
  the paired symbols ( the different types of brackets ) are paired such that the same finger should make the same motion to open and close , but with the opposite hand . 
  if you 're interested , i can send you the configuration files for linux and/or the ukelele configs for os x. 
  but python 2 already exists . 
  we are not pontificating on how the perfect new thing should be made . 
  we 're discussing which version of python should be used by a university course designed to be an introduction to programming . 
  how did this come about ? 
  because it 's probably not as bad as you 're thinking . 
  necessarily .
