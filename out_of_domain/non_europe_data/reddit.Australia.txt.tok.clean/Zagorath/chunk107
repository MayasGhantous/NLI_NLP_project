  it 's not `` fun '' per se , but it is exceedingly beautiful music , especially if you can have an orchestra ( even a midi one ) playing along with you . 
  just remember to play the part written for an a clarinet , trying to learn the fingerings for a b flat clarinet to sound the right pitch is too difficult , and really not worth it . 
  ( i wrote out a transposed version of the orchestral accompaniment in sibelius to play along with . ), 
  you might want to try and learn pitch pending if you have n't already , so you can play some jazz pieces . 
  the clarinet is an amazing instrument in jazz , i think ( and sadly underrated ) , but only if you can put in some pitch bends . 
  you could also learn the intro to [ rhapsody in blue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qltmanobb40 ) , which is definitely a blast to play !, 
  while i certainly do n't miss the lack of sleep , i 'd say it was definitely worth it . 
  many of my friends are at uni ( since i will be going back to australia for uni , i do n't start until february ) and i 've heard a lot about how their classmates are complaining about 600 , 1000 , etc. , word pieces , which having done ib my friends were completely used to it . 
  what our teachers told us about how it would prepare us for university seems to be true . 
  the workload , too , i suspect will prove to be much the same . 
  hl mathematics is an absolutely crazy course , where you pretty much have to be moving to a new topic every other lesson , if you even get that much time . 
  ib maths is much harder than any other western high school maths course i 've ever heard of , so it 's set me up well for the engineering course i 've applied to in uni . 
  ib in general has really heavy workloads , balancing heavy individual subject material , with ias , tok , cas , the ee , which i definitely think helps later in life . 
  speaking of which , i 'm really glad for having done the ee . 
  the ability to write extended pieces aside , just going in depth on a topic of personal interest to me was a great experience . 
  tok is an incredible course , and i 'm really glad to have had the honour of taking it , even if i never do philosophy of any sort in the future . 
  i 've used various aspects from the tok course in real life , especially the logical fallacies bit . 
  yep , i would recommend the ib diploma to absolutely anyone who is intelligent enough to be able to do it ( and by intelligent i mean academically so , as opposed to someone intelligent in an area that fails to be assessed by school , such as inter - or intrapersonal intelligence or bodily-kinesthetic intelligence ) . 
  just curious why you would say `` nearest 10th centimetre '' , why not just use millimetre ? 
  millimetres are actually more scientific ( fitting with the usual 1000 x in a y of the metric system ) , and a simpler word than the phrase used . 
  your wording also creates confusion : if my finger is 85mm , do i write 85 or 8.5 ? 
  i went with the latter , but i was n't entirely sure . 
  nevertheless , i 've done it , and i look forward to the results !, 
  actually , it 's basic economics . 
  if incomes are higher , that means that the demand will be higher ( a shift to the right on a supply-demand diagram ) , which causes both higher prices and higher quantity . 
  first year stuff . 
  i still do n't condone it , though . 
  i think it 's a hideous practice and companies which do it should be called out for it . 
  i imagine if this is actually the case , they would * want * it to be reported the way it has been . 
  they ca n't be seen to officially be gaming the system like that , i 'm pretty sure it would be illegal , and there 's a good chance whoever did it would get in serious trouble . 
  this way , the guy got a bed and a warm meal , the people who did it can quietly feel nice knowing they helped him out , and everybody 's happy . 
  that 's not my actual hand size , i just picked a random number . 
  part of my problem with this , though , is that the explanation of where to measure from is n't very clear . 
  it probably would have been better to have people measure from the knuckle , which is a clear and definite spot , i have no idea what he meant in his wording , and the way i interpreted it is likely to be different from the way someone else did . 
  in my first measuring one index finger was a centimetre longer than the other , when in fact they are the same length , or at least within one or two millimetres . 
  if we 're listing fallacies , you just committed both an argument from fallacy and an appeal to ridicule , not to mention you have repeatedly presented straw man arguments in this conversation . 
  how can you tell that a kid on a playground is a trombonist 's kid ? 
  he ca n't swing and he complains about the slide . 
  what do the letters pp mean to a trombone player ? 
  an opportunity for an improvised solo . 
  a polite reminder that he has been playing too loud for the past 5 minutes . 
  my experience from queensland ( i 'm applying to uq ) is that they ( and most of australia , from what i 'm lead to believe ) are amongst the best in the world at recognising ib . 
  the course i 'm applying to do is very maths heavy , but only requires a 5 at sl . 
  the 5 i got in hl will allow me to skip some classes in my first year at uni . 
  they probably have more or less the same thing for the queensland state system , but this just shows that they consider ib on par with their system . 
  damn i wrote out a huge thing that reddit decided to eat up . 
  apparently it was having problems last night ... 
  the tl ; dr of it was , yes . 
  the huge workload is great preparation compared to other systems ( a-levels , aps , etc. ), 
  for university : i 've had many friends comment on how their classmates at uni have been complaining about sub 1000 word assignments that my ib friends thought was nothing because of various ias and the ee . 
  aside from that , the overall workload is good practice in being able to balance all the different pieces of work ( schoolwork , ias , tok , ee , cas , etc. ), 
  with social lives etc. 
  i loved the ee because aside from the practice it gave , it was a great chance to go in depth on a topic i had a personal interest in . 
  really interesting . 
  i love tok , even if i never do a philosophy course in the future i 'm really glad to have learnt tok . 
  i use many parts of it in real life frequently , particularly fallacies . 
  i started this meaning it to be a tl ; dr , but went on to be almost as long as the original was , oh well . 
  the real tl ; dr , ** yes ** , ** i would recommend the ib diploma to anyone intelligent enough to do it . 
  ** ( and by intelligent i refer to the types of intelligence measured by schooling such as logical-mathematical and linguistic , and not to other types that are n't measured by school , such as inter - or intrapersonal intelligence or existential . ), 
  urgh , i wrote a long reply to this yesterday but reddit ate it up . 
  apparently it was having problems last night . 
  here 's more or less what i said :, 
  [ mozart clarinet concerto , second movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxgmork61yq ) . 
  i played clarinet for a long time before `` discovering '' this piece . 
  i mean , i had heard it before , but at one point i listened to it closely , and i fell in love with my instrument for the first time . 
  it 's not `` fun '' per se , but it 's exceedingly beautiful , especially if you can play it with an orchestral accompaniment . 
  i wrote the part out in sibelius to play along with the midi instruments . 
  if you learn this , play the part written for an a clarinet , do n't play the version to make it sound the same ( i.e. , your first note should be a c , not a b ) , it 's not worth the difficulty . 
  i would strongly recommend you learn to pitch bend ( glissando , portamento ) so that you can play some jazz . 
  the clarinet is a great instrument for jazz , in my opinion , and is sadly underrated . 
  however , it is absolutely essential that you can bend pitches and glissando between notes . 
  if you learn this you can play some really cool jazz music , and improvising becomes so much cooler . 
  in addition , you may want to learn the beginning of [ rhapsody in blue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qltmanobb40 ) ( up until 1 minute in ) , it 's super fun to play !, 
  i do n't understand . 
  estimated time of arrival : but they got rid of limbo . 
  [ i do n't see any other meanings for it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_\\ ( disambiguation \\ ) ) , could you let me know what it stands fro here ? 
  my general approach to religion capitalisation is : do n't . 
  i just do n't bother capitalising god . 
  i absolutely ** never ** capitalise him or his when referring to god , because that 's just wrong . 
  i can see why one would capitalise god when referring specifically to the single christian god , but him and his , no . 
  just no . 
  no he was referring to avatar by james cameron , he forgot that although the same is the same , it 's actually completely different . 
  do n't worry , there has n't been a film about avatar that you 've missed . 
  the text was funny , but i laughed for a good 20 seconds at the picture !, 
  ah , thanks . 
  i hate people like this . 
  i had a similar type of conversation ( albeit on a completely different topic ) not too long ago . 
  it 's absolutely infuriating when they completely ignore the points you 've made . 
  nevermind that he replied , it 's safe to assume that if someone says `` this country '' or words to that effect , that they 're talking about the us . 
  reddit is , for better or worse , predominantly made up of people from the us . 
  besides that , the op was npr , an american radio station . 
  i think you may have misread my comment . 
  i hate people like the girl on facebook . 
  i agree with you that controlled hunting is perfectly ok . 
  i hate it when you have a debate with people and they completely ignore the points you 've made : in this case the girl ignored what doug said about how regulated hunting can help the population . 
  by the way , is your cousin mark zuckerberg ? 
  i heard he kills all the meat he eats himself . 
  fair enough , i was n't sure . 
  ah yes , good point . 
  the op-ib conversion was much easier a couple years back , not sure why it went up so much recently , but it definitely does seem to be a relatively unbalanced conversion .
