  add to that his event music ( 3 olympics themes , 1 winter olympics , a bunch of tv stings , and heaps more ) , and then proper concert music as varied as five sacred trees , his horn concerto , and even a prelude and fugue , and it 's hard to think of * anyone * who has a greater output of modern music than williams does . 
  are you guys using formal methods ? 
  yeah i do n't know why it is , but i 've noticed * exported * pdfs from the homebrewery often look off , even though it looks fine on the website . 
  i think [ these screenshots ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ecjfl ) make the difference fairly clear . 
  yes . 
  brisbane is way too cold . 
  it 's still borderline too cold now . 
  personally , i found the worst bits of the show are when the two of them are fighting . 
  when they 're not together at all , the show was great . 
  at the start of season 4 when they were happily together , it was fine . 
  it 's only when they 're arguing and bickering , when the show devolves into petty inane relationship drama , that i have a problem . 
  if they think the best fix is doing away with the relationship entirely , that is find with me . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  no need to escape them . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  you do n't have to . 
  you can write prose if you want . 
  personally i actually tend to prefer stories written in prose . 
  but if you 're writing in the greentext format , with short punchy lines , then you need to prefix lines with ''  '' so that they display correctly . 
  select the first note on the page , then : create -  text -  title , or something like that . 
  you can type in the text you want each time . 
  your spell slots per level are * way * out . 
  or at least , they seem to be . 
  the table is really hard to read : you should really format it as a proper table so it 's clearer exactly what 's going on . 
  but at the moment , they seem to get 1st level spells at 1st level , but then not get 2nd level spells until 6th level ? 
  and they seem to have * nothing * going on after level 17 ? 
  it looks like what you * want * is to create a half caster . 
  in this case , just look at the table of spell slots that the paladin or the ranger has , and use the exact same one . 
  this is really interesting . 
  a very strong flavour , and i love that . 
  i 'm not entirely sure i understand it all , though . 
  how does the second lie work , if the first lie exists ? 
  you have no understanding of death , so how can you then think of the dead as being lazy ? 
  warlocks are nearly universally short rest based characters . 
  twice per long rest is * roughly * equivalent to once per short rest . 
  it would be more idiomatic if you were to change the third lie to be once per short rest . 
  you 're gaining some * very * powerful features at 6th level . 
  you 're also gaining some abilities that , in terms of flavour , feel far more like 10th level abilities . 
  if you look at the other otherworldly patrons , 10th level abilities tend to be the ones related in some way to defence , protection , or damage avoidance . 
  the sixth lie is just far , * far * too powerful . 
  even assuming `` highest spell level '' is only counting the main pact magic , and not the various mystic arcana , you 're granting the warlock access once per day to their choice of absolutely * any * 5th level spell . 
  * raise dead * ? 
  sure , why not . 
  * dominate person * ? 
  * mass cure wounds * ? 
  be my guest . 
  it 's the * ultimate * flexibility . 
  i do really like the seventh lie . 
  very cool . 
  overall i really like the flavour behind this . 
  it 's * incredibly * unique and interesting . 
  but i do feel that it 's * really * overpowered currently . 
  too many different features at 1st level and at 6th level , and the 10th level feature is just too powerful in its own right . 
  that 's in addition to a couple of unidiomatic choices , like the defensive stuff at 6th level and the twice per long rest thing . 
  my suggestion , if you want to keep all seven of the lies , would be to turn a few of them into complete ribbon features . 
  things that add flavour , but almost no mechanical benefit . 
  i would also suggest that * animate dead * and * contagion * might be too strong for a warlock . 
  one of the design notes is that spells given to warlocks should be considered more carefully than to other classes , due to the short rest reset of their spell slots . 
  certain spells are far more easily abused when granted on a short rest than on long rests , and i think the above spells probably are among these . 
  the other spells are fine , though , i think . 
  it 's better , but you 're still getting a * lot * of abilities at 1st level and at 6th level . 
  at 1st level , it gets :, 
  * resistance to being frightened ( which i do n't * think * is a term that actually makes sense within the mechanics of 5e -- if it does , please let me know where it is -- but i assume the * intended * behaviour is to provide advantage against effects that would cause frightening ) . 
  * unlimited * speak with dead * against a specific target ( which is likely to be the way it 's most often used * anyway * , so it 's essentially just unlimited * speak with dead * ) . 
  * a free success ( in most cases ) on a 1 once per short rest, 
  compare that to , say , the fiend , which gets :, 
  * a small amount of temp hp whenever it kills something, 
  that 's it , nothing else . 
  any * one * of the lies is about equal to that . 
  and the 6th level abilities have the same problem . 
  it 's for this month 's unearthed arcana article , which should be released early monday morning , utc-8 time ( or maybe utc-7 , i dunno when they start and end dst ) . 
  two paywall podcasts in as many weeks , in fact . 
  the cortex special episode and then the vinyl hi . 
  with a couple of weird exceptions ( the warlock being the only definite example i can think of , and you * could * consider spell-like classes such as the elemental monk ) ** every ** spell casting class follows ** exactly ** one of three spell slot configurations . 
  the full caster , which can be seen in the wizard , sorcerer , cleric , druid , and bard ; the half caster , which can be seen in the ranger and paladin ; and the third caster , which can be seen in the arcane trickster and eldritch knight . 
  these three types of casters are one of the basic fundamental building blocks in 5e , and they should not be changed unless you are constructing a radical overhaul of the entire system . 
  the most obvious reason for this is multiclassing : calculating how many spell slots you get if you multiclass among a variety of casters is easy if you stick to those simple mathematical ratios . 
  another reason is simply that that is what people expect . 
  when i 'm playing a caster and i forget how many spell slots i have , i open up my phb vaguely to the classes bit and flick to whichever caster class is nearest to it , rather than necessarily needling through to find the * exact * class i 'm taking , because i know they 're all the same . 
  making something that 's different muddies the water unnecessarily . 
  this looks and feels like it should be a half caster , thematically , so i would suggest that 's what you make it mechanically . 
  alternatively , you could make a fighter subclass that is a bit like the eldritch knight , but with more of an arcane archer approach to things , rather than using spells to enhance its swordfighting ability .

  they were originally monthly , but earlier this year they announced a switch to bi-monthly , with alternating months instead being a `` homebrew review '' , where they look at homebrew posted on their `` dungeon master 's guild '' and give feedback . 
  this was not received well , probably because the guild is frankly a terrible forum for homebrew creation for a whole host of reasons , and also because their reviews were not so much reviews as excuses to show off stuff . 
  very little could actually be learnt by us based on their reviews . 
  not to mention , of course , that it meant we were getting less actual uas so they stopped doing those after only a couple of months . 
  now they seem to be getting back to their regular method of releasing one on the first monday of every month . 
  you can only sa with a weapon , not a spell .
