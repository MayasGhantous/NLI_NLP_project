  but you * do n't * have to take the attack action to sa . 
  so if you use a cantrip or spell that says `` make a melee weapon attack '' , like those in the scag , then you can use sa . 
  arrow has not been good lately , but / r/arrow is just taking it to stupid extents . 
  it 's no where near as bad as they make out . 
  i went in with zero expectations . 
  had n't seen * any * marketing or * any * reviews for it . 
  i thought it was a bizarre and strangely constructed film , but in a good way . 
  it was certainly an enjoyable experience . 
  how would you propose it be done ? 
  looks like he got taken out by jimbo wiggle . 
  if you use the instrument change function in sibelius it should handle everything for you . 
  which is ? 
  [ i voted hcke9a4mnxcfj3raden3zqppy1gyckuulwd + ojrbv40 ], 
  that does n't exactly make a convincing argument that this is `` unecessarily [ sic ] complicated '' . 
  it 's literally one extra really small step that you get completely walked through . 
  i just do n't like it when people who are n't even real members of this community come along and complain about it . 
  even more so when it 's over such minor issues . 
  age of mythology and aoe iii are better , but equally do not require two hands . 
  i 'll grant you , eclipse and other ides have incredibly cluttered user interfaces , and the vast majority of the features surfaced are ones that i know i basically never use ( and i suspect most people are the same ) . 
  but how hard is it to click the one button that makes it run ? 
  that one feature is pretty hard to miss . 
  it 's a green button with a `` play '' icon on it . 
  both the colour green and that icon are universally recognised as meaning something related to `` go '' , `` play '' , or `` run '' . 
  my opinion is that c and its good values should be learnt early on , but not * first * . 
  let the student learn about what a variable is , how loop constructs , conditionals , and functions work in a more friendly environment first , and * then * dive straight in to c . one or * maybe * two semesters of python , and then you go back to basics with c. 
  even better if before c but after python , you go through logic gates , basic alus ( along with an understanding of binary representations ) , and then a touch of assembly . 
  is n't it just under file -  export ? 
  i ca n't say i 've ever had any problems with that . 
  trying to get a windows installer , on the other hand , was a * whole * other problem ... 
  in my case , having an installer was a requirement for a uni project . 
  and by the gods it 's hard to figure out how to do . 
  dozens of utilities out there when you google , but none of them work properly and intuitively . 
   i would rule that specific beats general, 
  the general rule is that * wish * ignores material components . 
  the specific rule is that * contingency * requires you have the material components with you while it 's active . 
  the `` specific beats general '' argument really does n't work here . 
  i agree that * wish * should still allow these spells to work , but i would rule that casting * wish * creates the components if necessary . 
  i did n't see what subreddit it was on . 
  i thought it was / r/girlsinagif based on the title . 
  so for me it was really unexpected . 
  intellij is absolutely * not * any more user-friendly in this respect than eclipse is . 
  it 's not worse either , but there 's nothing about this aspect of it that 's better . 
  it might depend on the manner in which you 've imported those libraries . 
  i 've certainly never had any problems with exporting a jar that includes all necessary resources in a single file , including third party libraries . 
   you higlighted some tasks that are supposed to be hidden under n +1 menus, 
  no , i described buttons that are presented front and centre in the toolbar . 
  exactly the same as intellij . 
  you are n't using a dam to manage importing your raw images ? 
  you know you can get it with option-8 anyway , right ? 
  this will also work on linux , so long as you have ` wget ` installed . 
  it can even work on windows if you have the latest version with the ubuntu linux command line tools and use that . 
  that 's really misleading , because it 's counting money she makes off her land , as if , were the monarchy abolished , that land would just disappear . 
  it 's also counting income from tourism , as though people never visit unused castles and palaces -- in this respect , despite what monarchists will tell you , abolishing it could be a net * positive * , as previously out of bounds locations like buckingham palace could be opened for more tourism . 
  i , too , miss aperture , but yeah , i 've switched to lightroom . 
  it does a decent job and it certainly runs smoother than aperture ever did , even if its interface is less intuitive . 
  i 've not used maven or other build managers . 
  to be honest i do n't understand how they work . 
  okay , now create and iterate over a two-dimensional array . 
  or read and iterate over a file . 
  or go through the basic rudiments of objects and inheritance . 
  [ here is the layout i use ] ( http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/76c3309992a060beaddffcddb55752d7 ) . 
  my primary point of difference to * the * programmer 's dvorak is a sort of symmetry in using the different types of brackets . 
  normal brackets are made by the index finger moving up and inward , square brackets are the middle finger up and inward , and curly braces are the fourth ( ring ) finger moving up and slightly outward . 
  it also means the asterisk and plus signs are roughly in symmetry to one another . 
  you also get easy access to `` $ '' for languages that use that as variable indicators . 
  keyboard shortcuts do n't tend to bother me too much because i was using dvorak in its normal form for years before adopting my coder 's dvorak layout . 
  but i 've been using this for a few years now and it has served me very well . 
  i find your decision to swap * letters * around very perplexing . 
  does that not make it much harder to use ? 
  i find the mental shift between programming and normal typing in regards to * symbols and numbers * happens automatically for me , but if i had to adjust to a different placement of * letters * i can only imagine that would throw me off . 
  this bot gets it wrong more often than it gets it right . 
  i do n't think that picture is korean ramyeon . 
  it 's something similar , but ramyeon is spelt \ub77c\uba74 in korean , and that does n't appear anywhere on the packet . 
  i could be wrong though , maybe they just do n't want to call it by that name for some reason . 
   i 'm not sure if there 's a default or something as i 'm working by memory and what google images has, 
  the closest to `` default '' is probably just the . app sitting next to an alias to ~ / applications ( or / applications . 
  i forget which is most used ) . 
  white background , no fancy graphics or text . 
  an even more basic would probably be just the . app , with the user expected to find their applications directory and drag it there themselves . 
   there ... are ... four ... 
  lights !, 
  this gets my approval based on that reference alone . 
  wait , so is `` pixel xl '' the new assumed name for the sailfish/marlin ( i forget which is which ) phone ? 
  there are * so many * episodes of that show that are really profound . 
  i think so far ( and i 'm currently only half way through the final season ) the greatest has been the inner light . 
  did we ever for certain see crusher give her a diagnosis ? 
  i do n't remember getting one , so i just assumed when i heard that line at the end that she was completely faking just for the pretence . 
   such as only apple components , keyboards , mice , printers , monitors etc. . . 
  when the fuck was the last time you looked at them ? 
  macs work with absolutely any of the same keyboards , mouses , printers , and monitors that any other computer can use , and have done for a ** very ** long time . 
  it sounds to me like the downvotes are n't so much about `` butt hurt '' as it is not appreciating ignorance on an ** astronomical ** level . 
  oh that 's a good way of remembering it !, 
  so is pixel xl the new assumed release name for codename marlin ? 
  i thought so too at first , but i think that has too much of a religious connotation , which throws off what op 's going for . 
  inquisitor almost sounds like it could be a paladin oath . 
  star trek : the next generation . 
  specifically , the episodes titled `` chain of command '' , s06e10 -- 11 .
