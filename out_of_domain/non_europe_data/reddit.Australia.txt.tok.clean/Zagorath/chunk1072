  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  but to give you a brief answer , in general dex is a master stat . 
  it 's the * strongest * of the strong saves , it provides a huge amount to your ac , it can be used for a number of important skills , and it 's where your initiative comes from . 
  the barbarian is based around the idea of being mostly melee based attacks . 
  it would mean you can consolidate from needing a bit of 3 different stats to just 2 . 
  you could get the benefits of reckless attack without suffering much of the risk . 
  i actually love the economy of trek !, 
  it 's really easy to see a not so distant future from our real world where we have in practice if not in theory the same system . 
  as more and more jobs are capable of being automated ( with retail and transport jobs already looking under * serious * threat , and many more likely to be gone by the end of the century ) , the only way we can possibly have a functioning society and economy is if either we do away with money entirely \u00e0 la trek , or just * give * people enough money to be able to live comfortably without needing a job and wage . 
  it 's just not going to be * possible * for huge numbers of people to be permanently employed in profit-seeking businesses for much longer . 
  hey just so you know , it looks like mega.nz is a banned site on reddit , since it is automatically getting placed in the spam filter . 
  this means nobody can see it unless or until one of the moderators manually approves it . 
  i would approve this comment and your other one linking to mega.nz for you , but it appears that your links are no longer valid . 
  either you 've deleted the thing they 're supposed to point to , or they have been removed by mega for some reason . 
  or perhaps you 've just copied the link incorrectly . 
  whatever the case , in the future i would suggest uploading to a more trusted site like google drive so that it can be seen immediately , rather than needing to be approved by a mod . 
  to be fair , people should almost never use h1 headings on that site . 
  they should only be used if you are creating large compendiums and need to start a new * chapter * , like `` races '' or `` classes '' . 
  most people are creating a * single * race or class , and so should start with h2 headings . 
  yeah as a dm i would be changing humanoids back to how it worked with the old ranger . 
  you can still get you +2 / +4 damage , but only against 2 types of humanoids . 
  even that is still a ** very ** powerful boost and i suspect most people interested in damage output ( as opposed to picking something entirely because of flavour ) would still choose it . 
  agree ** completely ** regarding favoured enemy . 
  i 'll probably present this and allow my players to use this new ranger , but will be changing humanoids back to 2 subtypes . 
  what play styles are there ? 
  at the moment i ca n't think of any area of the game that 's worth ignoring . 
  surely also the fact that there are pedestrians on the walkway , which a cyclist would then need to go around anyway , is also a huge factor in their decision to just ride along the dirt path the whole way ? 
  i really like this . 
  it feels like it really gets the flavour that wizards is going for with the ranger , and it does it in a mechanically appropriate way , rather than underpowered like the phb ranger or crazy overpowered like their other attempts . 
  i 'm personally not normally a huge fan of the wizards ranger flavour -- i prefer an ithilien ranger or a d\u00fanedain , something non-magical -- but this definitely grabbed my attention . 
  the one thing that stood out to me was being able to choose * all * humanoids as your favoured enemy . 
  way too powerful . 
  as a dm , i will be changing that back to the 2 subtypes of humanoid that the phb had . 
  it still gets the +2 / +4 damage bonus , so i believe that anyone interested primarily in mechanical benefit ( as opposed to picking based on flavour ) is * still * going to choose humanoids as the clear best option , but at least this way it 's not so much more powerful than other options . 
  i really like their approach to the beastmaster . 
  it makes me actually interested in playing one !, 
  they did an awesome job of evoking the feeling of having a beloved pet that fights along side you . 
  ~ ~ i worry that with the hp not scaling at all , at higher levels these things will die * all the time * , which is worrying . ~ ~ but at least ac scales quite strongly , and they eventually ( albeit rather belatedly relative to the damage they 'd be receiving imo ) get a bonus on saving throws .

  edit : i have been informed that the animal gains hit dice as you level up . 
  i must have missed that on my first read-through . 
   favored enemy ... serves as the only pre archetype combat ability of note, 
  * 1st level : favoured enemy, 
  * 2nd level : fighting style, 
  * 2nd level : spellcasting ( hunter 's mark included ), 
  there are three major combat boosting abilities gained before the player chooses their conclave . 
  additionally , the level 6 , 14 , 18 , and 20 non-conclave features all have combat benefit . 
  oh shit , i missed that !, 
  well then , that fixes my number 1 criticism with it !, 
   i would have limited this to skills from the ranger 's available proficiency list . 
  that makes sense , but i think i would add intimidation to that list , and i might remove insight and * possibly * investigation . 
   they get asi 's when you do , and there 's nothing preventing them from trading those for feats, 
  yes there is . 
  there 's the fact that nothing gives them feats . 
  the rules for feats state :, 
   at certain levels , your class gives you the ability score improvement feature . 
  using the optional feats rule , you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead . 
  nothing in that implies that a character which is not a player character or built using the pc rules would also be able to take a feat . 
  because when people think of rangers , their first thought is not the history of d&d , it 's rangers in fiction . 
  the d\u00fanedain or the ithilien rangers are probably the most obvious , followed by other examples like the night 's watch ranger order , the books entitled `` ranger 's apprentice '' , maybe even robin hood . 
  none of these have a high level of magical use , and where they do it 's very limited : a use of magical poultices , for example . 
  besides , the druids already have an answer to paladins : the oath of ancients . 
  personally , my preferred d&d `` ranger '' is to multiclass fighter and rogue , and reflavour some things slightly . 
  but i do think that as far as creating the typical d&d ranger ( as much as its flavour is not one that appeals to me ) , this unearthed arcana does a fantastic job of getting that flavour appropriately and being balanced at the same time . 
  whether slippery slope is a fallacy depends on only one thing : do you * know * that a leads to b , and b leads to c ? 
  if you do not , then it is fallacious to claim a leads to c. 
  if you can not * prove * both a leads to b and b leads to c , then claiming that a leads to c is fallacious and wrong . 
  and certainly , in this case , nobody has come up with that proof . 
  no , it does n't say `` you have to be a pc to gain feats '' . 
  what it says is that `` you gain a feat if you are a pc '' . 
  a \u21d2 b \u21ce b \u21d2 a , of course , but what it means is that if a \u21d2 b , we can make * no * conclusions from that about what b is if we know a is not true . 
  in this case , we know being a pc means you can take a feat . 
  if a is not true , the game currently makes * no * specific claims about feats . 
  but in general , if the game does not specify you * can * do something mechanical , then you ca n't . 
  the game does n't say you * ca n't * , as a pc , take a free feat every level . 
  but we know you ca n't , because it does n't say you can . 
  similarly , the game says nothing about pets getting feats . 
  this is because the general assumption in the game is that you do n't * need * to specify a lack of something . 
  in terms of the game mechanics , a lack of evidence * is * evidence of absence . 
  it 's like you did n't even read the above comment ... 
  not splitting them is a dumb move , because it makes one choice the * clear * correct one as it is orders of magnitude more powerful than any other choice , and it makes the character insanely strong , particularly at lower levels . 
  even if you split them , choosing humanoids is probably still going to be a very popular option , because * humans * as a single race are such popular enemies , and you can still get a second one ( elves are a pretty good choice , as are orcs or goblins ) . 
  when one choice is mechanically the best choice even * after * nerfing it , then not nerfing it is a dumb move . 
  weaker ? 
  2 humanoids means you can get humans , which * on their own * makes it stronger than any other option . 
  add to that the option of also choosing elves , orcs , or goblins , and humanoids is still clearly the best favoured enemy you could choose . 
  it 's no longer * so much * ahead of others that it would n't be worth choosing something else for flavour reasons , but if you 're after pure mechanical advantage it 's the obvious way to go . 
  you read it , you just completely ignored the intent . 
  when people think of rangers , they think of what they 've read about rangers . 
  the setting is irrelevant because it 's not related to how people think when they see the term .
