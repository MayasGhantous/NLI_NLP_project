  a bonus to hit would actually be worth slightly more than the damage bonus in normal play . 
  +2 to hit means that if you previously needed to roll an 8 to hit ( so ac generally around 13 ) , you now will be hitting 20 percentage points more often . 
  if we assume 8 damage normally ( 1d8 + 3 ) , you 'll be doing an amortised 6.5 per turn if you get the +2 damage , and 6.8 per turn with +2 to hit . 
  [ hmm , looks like the new res update has made this bot redundant . 
  do n't forget that this ranger was supposedly balanced assuming they * never * get to fight their favoured enemy . 
  you 've still got your fighting style , your extra attack/beast , and spells like * hunter 's mark * adding things on . 
  but my issue really is more about the opportunity cost * within * the ranger . 
  if one choice is clearly and by far the superior one , either the others need buffs or it needs to be nerfed , because having only one choice that actually makes any sense is bad design . 
  how is 2 weak ? 
  even if it was just * one * , choosing `` humans '' would make it still at least on par with the other options . 
  2 means you get humans * and * something else -- elves , goblins , and orcs would all be very good choices if you do n't know precisely what 's going to come up . 
  res includes the alt text now , but yeah i guess the other things are still useful . 
  the expression , by the way , is `` could n't care less '' . 
  look at the screenshot . 
  it just puts it below . 
  that would fall under perception , though . 
  investigation is about making * deductions * or reasoning to figure something out . 
  that 's why it 's an intelligence based stat , rather than wisdom . 
  you mistake me . 
  i was n't saying that the * claim * was wrong , only that it is wrong to * make * the claim . 
  incidentally , a justified true belief is not actually a sufficient condition to have knowledge , as evidenced by the gettier problem . 
  but if you have some * actual * problems with what i 've claimed , please * do * go into them . 
  if i 've made a mistake i 'd like to know . 
  '' ** claiming ** that a leads to c is ... wrong '' . 
  i 'm not saying that a * necessarily * does n't lead to c , only that it would be wrong to claim it does , because you have not justified that claim . 
   but now there 's no balance recommendation, 
  huh ? 
  did you look at the ua ? 
   as a rule of thumb , a beast can serve as an, 
  animal companion if it is medium or smaller , has 15 or, 
  fewer hit points , and can not deal more than 8 damage, 
  with a single attack . 
  in general , that applies to creatures, 
  with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less , but there are, 
  exceptions . 
  does n't ap maths do that weird thing they show in american tv shows where instead of taking maths , you piecemeal select certain specific types of maths ? 
  that 's always seemed like a * terrible * system to me , and to the maths teachers i 've talked to ( who are mostly australian or british ) . 
  you constituency ? 
  if you really cared , you would know we do not use that word to describe our electoral districts here . 
  you serve your electorate , or possibly your seat . 
  hear hear !, 
  not if they decided not to attend because they knew from polls leading up to the referendum that it was going to succeed . 
  thanks for the warning . 
  if i had tried to read that normally it would have made no sense . 
  reading backwards , it still makes no sense , but that 's just because the story is bizarre , so it 's not so bad . 
  maybe not , but you * should * care how he votes , because outside of labor and the greens , 4 votes are needed for a vote against the government in the senate . 
  even one government senator crossing the floor makes that a * lot * easier to achieve -- whether you agree with the issue or not , his vote matters . 
  psst , the humerus is a bone in your arm . 
  humorous is when something is funny . 
  both are pretty funny looking words , though , so there 's that . 
  first major revision ? 
  even assuming you meant major revision * of the ranger * , that 's not true . 
  this is at least the third . 
  first was the spellless ranger in the [ modifying classes ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/modifying-classes ) ua , and then they did a far more ambitious overhaul last year in [ unearthed arcana : ranger ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/dx_0907_ua_rangeroptions.pdf ) . 
  and now there 's this one , which is n't really a * huge * change like the last one was , but instead makes minor tweaks to specific features . 
  edit : okay , you acknowledged the spellless ranger a little later in the episode , but there 's still the first full redo that did n't get mentioned . 
  it 's not a term that is used in australia . 
  which you would know if you were australian or at least were an active member of the model australian community . 
  they are * always * called electorates , electoral divisions , or seats . 
  [ the wikipedia article on the matter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divisions_of_the_australian_house_of_representatives ) also mentions `` divisions '' , but the word `` constituency '' is never mentioned . 
  i think it 's a kind of car . 
   this is making it so that there 's a much better chance that the ranger will benefit from the ability, 
  that should n't be necessary , since this was supposedly balanced assuming the ranger * never * gets to fight their favoured enemy . 
   i do n't think it 's more powerful than all aberrations , all undead , or all monstrosities, 
  i definitely do . 
  in fact , even if it was * only humans * it would be at least on par with any of those other options in a typical campaign . 
  add the option of elves , goblins , orcs , or some other choice of common humanoid , and it 's still about the most powerful option even if you * do * nerf it . 
  it 's just that after nerfing , it 's not * so much * more powerful that choosing something else based on your preferred flavour is no longer quite so bad . 
   non-math specific issues, 
  could you explain what those are ? 
  i 'm not as familiar with ap as i am with the australian system , le bac from france , or the uk 's a-levels , but most of the others i 've seen suffer from one pretty large problem , which is that they allow far too much specialisation at what i consider too early an age . 
  a-levels in particular are * really * bad , where a student can , if they want , take music , art , and drama , or can take physics , maths , and chemistry , and nothing else . 
  the breadth of learning ib forces upon you is what , to me , makes it stand out * by far * as the best system out of those i 'm familiar with . 
  i do n't know much about ap to say for certain , but i * thought * it has much the same problem as a-levels , just to a lesser extent . 
  yes , exactly . 
  they 've had their `` acceptable ads '' programme for quite a while now , where they would simply not block ads that are deemed acceptable . 
  things like not making sounds , being clearly distinguished from content , not being in the way of content , etc. 
  it 's basically a way for sites to make money so long as they respect their users . 
  this sounds like just an extension of that . 
  and , assuming it functions how it did before , you can turn it off if you want to be a * complete * arsehole about it . 
  it just defaults to on to allow respectful sites to continue to stay alive . 
   what 's with the down votes ? 
  am i wrong ? 
  yes , very . 
  try reading the article . 
  or even just reading the summary / u/deanarrowed posted . 
  i have n't seen it either , but yvette nicole brown as amanda waller sounds like * perfect * casting . 
  dimaggio as darkseid strikes me as ... odd , though . 
  mearls tweeted it . 
  i believe the reasoning was that they did n't want people to feel like , if they * do n't * get to fight their favoured enemy , they 're getting a raw deal . 
  that was the exact reason that up until now the favoured enemy ability gave no real combat benefit . 
  i guess they gave up on that in order to deal with the criticism many people had for the feature , but it certainly does seem rather odd when it means that if they * do * face their favoured enemy frequently ( which , if they take humanoids , will be * most of the time * under the current rules ) , they 're are overpowered relative to what this is supposedly balanced against . 
  but oh well . 
  maybe being somewhat overpowered is necessary to overcome the negative stigma the class already has attached to it . 
  could you explain what you mean here ? 
  how is the energy from an entire star in any way like using aaa batteries to charge a car ? 
  fwiw , in currently dming a campaign where arcane magic is outlawed . 
  i would * love * to have a player try to get around it . 
  sorcerers with subtle spell would be awesome , or warlocks with momf , or whatever . 
  it 'd be really cool .
