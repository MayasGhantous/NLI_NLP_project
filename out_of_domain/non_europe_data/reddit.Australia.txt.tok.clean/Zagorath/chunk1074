  just because it 's banned in-universe does n't mean i want it to be banned for players . 
  if i did , that would be what i 'd specify . 
  what 's the reference here ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  this is a great article , but it 's not appropriate to this subreddit . 
  this place is for sharing * stories * from roleplaying games . 
  you should try submitting this at / r/dnd and / r/dndnext , instead . 
  i 've removed it from this subreddit . 
  as a side note , elphaba is from a * book * called wicked , which the musical of the same name is based on . 
  it 's a really great read , though i 'm told it differs from the musical somewhat ( i 've not seen the play ) .

  i * really * strongly disagree with you regarding the spellcasting . 
  i think the way it currently works feels right , with them feeling more like the bard or eldritch knight in terms of how magic works for them relative to their other abilities , than like the cleric . 
  it 's also an important point of mechanical difference between the ranger and the paladin . 
  i also do n't have any problem with the hunter as is , and i 'm unsure about the changes to the stalker . 
  other than that , i really like what you 've done here . 
  the humanoid break-up , in particular , is * really * necessary . 
  so , raw companions ca n't take * any * feats . 
  you would need to specify precisely how these feats work in this document . 
  presumably it 's something you can have your companion do en lieu of their asis , but it does n't actually say that . 
  how does barding work ? 
  they can become proficient with it , but there are no rules on how it works , so it 's kinda useless . 
  there are problems with the revised ranger , though . 
  most notably the fact that choosing humanoids as your favoured enemy is ludicrously overpowered compared to the other options . 
   herschel was sure that he had found ample evidence of life on the moon and compared it to the english countryside . 
  he did not refrain himself from theorising that the other planets were populated , with a special interest in mars , which was in line with most of his contemporary scientists . 
  at herschel 's time , scientists tended to believe in a plurality of civilised worlds , while most religious thinkers referred to unique properties of the earth . 
  ** herschel went so far to speculate that the interior of the sun was populated . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_herschel ), 
  obviously he can be forgiven for this mistake , having far less information to base his speculations on than we have today . 
  but it 's still an absolutely hilarious thing to think about . 
  oh right , thanks . 
  i did n't know that was there . 
  i get where you 're coming from , but i view it as being far more of a `` using what they can learn about nature '' thing than a `` being in tune with nature itself '' thing . 
  did cd projekt do the ports for witcher 1 and 2 themselves ? 
  i do n't know about 2 , but 1 is literally unplayable through their port . 
  crashes ** all the time ** -- like , every five minutes -- even after creating a custom more updated wineskin wrapper . 
  before doing that , it just crashed right after the cutscene that ends the opening area . 
  perhaps they 've gotten better at it since , but i 'm not sure i 'd trust the ports of whomever was responsible for the witcher on mac . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 52e8hw/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 52e8hw/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  you 're conflating the mechanism used and the amount of travel given . 
  the butterfly design is superior to precious designs , and it could be used with more travel . 
  if they had used another design on the new macbooks , it would have been even worse than it is . 
  eh , i 've never had the sd slot in my mbp work properly anyway . 
  i 've always needed to have an external reader . 
  i would n't mind if they got rid of that . 
  eh , i could make do without ethernet . 
  i want them to bring back a proper fucking graphics card without needing to pay three thousand fucking dollars . 
  that alone is going to keep me on my 2012 15 incher for quite a while .

   so honestly , as the port is very important for me for stuff like that , imagine how important it is for a photographer who fills up one sd after another . 
  i am a photographer mate . 
  that 's why i know that i always need to carry a separate sd reader with me , because the in-built one is just far too unreliable . 
  not to mention a separate one can be used for both full sds and microsds , rather than needing to carry a special microsd-sd adaptor . 
  yeah , one thing i saw a few people criticise star wars episode vii for was for being mostly forgettable . 
  what i think * they * forget is just how much background music there is in the original 6 films . 
  it 's not all binary sunsets and imperial marches . 
  you need your background music going on through the recitative just as much as you need those fantastic arias and duets . 
  anybody know if that roundtable conversation of the composers is available anywhere ? 
  the one they cut to a bunch of times , including 6:07 ish . 
  i think it 'd be really interesting to watch that whole thing . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about here . 
  zimmer is one of the ** biggest ** culprits in the dumbing down of modern cinematic music . 
   take a look at the new star wars , for example . 
  notice the lack of a memorable score from the john williams ? 
  that 's not his fault . 
  actually , with respect , i think you 're wrong . 
  i think the most recent star wars had a * fantastic * score . 
  but i 've seen the argument you 're making come up quite often . 
  a big part of it , in my opinion is the fact that we 've seen the original 6 films so many times , we 're just used to them . 
  we know all the themes off by heart , and the music in them is almost more of an * idea * than something we actually analyse . 
  but try analysing it . 
  next time you watch them , pay attention to how much comparatively bland background music there is . 
  it 's quite a lot . 
  there are fantastic moments , of course , but not every moment can or should be that . 
  to steal a comment from someone in the / r/classicalmusic thread on this post :, 
   i do n't think being forgettable is a bad trait in itself . 
  if it fits the scene then it 's still good because on many occasions it 's really not a terrible thing for the music to sit in the background . 
  whilst i get that it 's always nice to have good music , trying to constantly have earworms in the background would be ott imo . 
  not every moment can be a binary sunset or imperial march . 
  take a look at episode vii and you 'll see * fantastic * scoring . 
  right from the beginning , after the fanfare , the first major bit of music you hear is as kylo ren comes down in his ship , his theme is played loudly and prominently , and it reappears throughout the film . 
  the other really prominent new motif is rey 's theme , which equally does a fantastic job of defining her character in some really clever ways . 
  i can easily hum either kylo 's or rey 's themes from that movie , because on my second watch through i made sure to pay attention to it . 
  i suspect by the time episode ix is out on dvd , assuming john williams makes it through to the end , most people will have as much familiarity with these themes as they do with the force theme or vader 's theme . 
  it just takes a little longer for someone not actively trying to notice it . 
  i agree with the points you made in the general sense of modern filmmaking . 
  i just do n't agree with specifically calling out the music in star wars vii as an example . 
  if you 're interested , [ here is a series of reviews of episode vii 's score ] ( http://orchestrationonline.com/category/orchestration-reviews/star-wars/ ) from a professional orchestrator which i believe is quite accessible even to non-musicians , and focusses in-depth on different elements of the score . 
  i think the most recent star wars had a * fantastic * score .
