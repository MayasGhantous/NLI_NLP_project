  also what 's the location ? 
  it may be cheaper to head over to vietnam or something for a holiday and get it done there . 
  even at the high quality places that get frequented by expats , you 'll get prices * way * cheaper than that . 
  plus you get to visit a great country too !, 
  just for what it 's worth , japan is n't south east asian . 
  sea is more your vietnams and malaysias . 
  korea and japan are north east , or just east asia . 
   after my character almost died a few times because of the luck of the dice he realized that i was n't getting special treatment, 
  of all the things to make him realise it , that seems an ... unusual one . 
  i mean , it was * almost * died , after all . 
  it 's admittedly difficult to put my mind into the headspace of someone who 'd be accusing you of that sort of thing in the first place , but i 'd have thought that if my previous assumption is `` this person is getting special treatment '' , then an * almost * death would equate to `` this person would have died if not for special treatment '' . 
  if you 're interested in computer science at university , i would * highly * recommend maths hl . 
  you 'll probably have to do some sort of linear algebra and some multivariate calculus as part of the degree , and that 's going to be * really * hard if you have n't got the hl maths background . 
  discrete maths and statistics/probability are also important areas involved in computer science and software engineering . 
  so if you can take one of those two as your options topic , that would be immensely useful . 
  ( if the choice is between those , i 'd recommend statistics just because it tends to be the harder one to pick up at uni , so having more experience with it is more worthwhile . ), 
  i do n't know how valuable ib computer science is because i do n't know the curriculum , but university programmes tend to be designed to accomodate people with no experience in programming . 
  maths is another story , and if you do n't have hl maths you may have to do an extra catch-up course , or work * really * hard on your first year courses . 
  but all this really depends on the university , and the way things are done can vary greatly from one to another , let alone between different countries . 
  as a side note , i would also recommend looking in to software engineering at university . 
  there are some technical differences between what the two actually mean , but in practice it 's basically a university-by-university thing . 
  some unis will have compsi be the better option , and some will have softeng . 
  certainly though , in general , coming out with a degree that says `` engineering '' on it sounds better than `` science '' . 
  you should also try submitting this to / r/samplesize to get a wider audience . 
  probably a time zone thing . 
  korea is utc +8 , america is utc-4 in the * best case * . 
  if they get it out 20/09 in korea , that 's likely going to be 21/09 in america . 
   becoming ... something else, 
  ouch . 
  that hurts . 
  da doi . 
  i need to get some sleep ... 
  hi , could you please provide a source for where the artwork came from , if possible ? 
  we like to make sure artists get due credit for their work whenever possible . 
  wow this is amazing work !, 
  these look brilliant . 
  but they seem to be missing some stuff . 
  the spell-less ranger , the mystic , the feats , the fighting style from the underdark , as well as a couple of articles that i have to admit i had completely forgotten even existed until i did some searching just now . 
  [ gothic heroes ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/sites/default/files/media/upload/articles/ua%20gothic%20characters.pdf ) and [ non-divine faithful ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/ua%20non-divine%20faithful%20sfg.pdf ) . 
  forgive me if they are already in there i 've missed them somehow . 
  edit : also the mariner fighting style from the waterborne ua . 
  the spell-less ranger is a bit of a special case though , since it is , well , spell-less . 
  it 's designed to scratch a different itch to the phb ranger and the other two ua rangers . 
  more of a d\u00fanedain or ithilien ranger than the outright magical feeling of the other ones . 
  what 's the location ? 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm a clarinettist . 
  unfortunately everton park is quite a bit out of my way though . 
   it 's $ 10 . 
  wait what ? 
  it was free when i got it ... 
  i thought it was even open source ... 
  hey , we 've gone ahead and pinned this to the top of / r/unearthedarcana for the time being . 
  thanks for the great work !, 
  to the guy that reported this for `` brigading '' :, 
  if the user is very physically active , a pulse lower than 50 is possible , and one would * hope * the blood would be delivered through arteries -- if not , something may be seriously wrong . 
  that argument is pretty much rejected by most serious musicologists . 
  the idea that his oncoming dementia would have lead to such a repetitive piece is really quite an absurd one when you think about it . 
  it 's not as though he wrote the thing from start to finish in order without ever looking back on it . 
  or as though he never heard it performed . 
  the idea that he wrote a really repetitive piece because of his dementia just does n't make sense . 
  the piece itself is great , but to me what makes in truly awesome is hearing it in context . 
  when you 've gone through the first hour of the carmina burana , including the first o fortuna , the build up to its reprise , and the transition into it in the last moments of the ave formosissima are just so incredible . 
  that brief pause is one of the greatest moments in music imo . 
  the tools are n't * great * though . 
  you can get around them with some simple restructuring/refactoring of the code . 
  just changing variable names is n't enough , but it is certainly possible to cheat them without actually learning anything or coding the assignment yourself . 
   i assume you mean javascript here, 
  when i see `` web development '' , the first thing i think of is server-side development . 
  js does n't come to mind unless i hear specifically that they 're doing front-end . 
   even the best algorithms started with an iterative process, 
  some start with a recursive process . 
  the hardest problem i 've ever had was for an algorithms and data structures class , and it involved writing an iterative algorithm to perform the function of a problem that was conceptually recursive ( and had already been implemented recursively ) . 
  ( i know that 's not what you meant by `` iterative '' , but considering the subreddit i thought it was appropriate . ), 
  the bot could just give both corrections every time . 
  say `` either you meant [ this ] , or you meant [ this ] . '', 
  hey sorry , but i am removing this . 
  rule 2 of / r/unearthedarcana is that content is not allowed to have a paywall . 
  if you can change these to pay what you want , you can repost them . 
  thanks . 
  could be [ this post , which is the original source of the sir bearington tale ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dpqop/the _ original_story_of_sir_bearington / ) . 
  it 's available in [ our hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  will that be their first conlang ? 
  maybe they 've already got esperanto or quenya ? 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 52e8hw/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 52e8hw/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  that 's not a bad idea . 
  asking users to explicitly mention that their answer is none of the above means you know that they intended to say none of the above , rather than being that they prefer not to answer , or somehow missed it accidentally . 
  just so long as it 's one of those things where the none of the above button is a radio button despite the others being check boxes . 
  allowing none of the above to be selected * in addition * to the others would be weird . 
  i agree . 
  but i also find its combat * way * better the dragon age origins , which is another game i feel fits into the `` great story , bad gameplay '' category . 
   he seems to work a lot with [ michael giacchino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_giacchino ) , who has done * up * , * ratatouille * , and a bunch of other pixar films . 
  not to mention hell be replacing desplat on the rogue one soundtrack . 
  the credits mention art , but there does n't seem to be any art in this version of the document . 
  i do n't think i 've ever been more confused than i am right now looking at this photo , with that title , in this subreddit .
