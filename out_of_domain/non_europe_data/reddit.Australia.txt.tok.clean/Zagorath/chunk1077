  how the f do you march in 5/4 ? 
  try starting again . 
  try downloading another file from the same site . 
  try another browser . 
  if all these fail , probably an issue with their servers . 
   the top ones are all older, 
  at least part of the reason is that when this subreddit was new , there was nearly no traffic . 
  i and a few other people were keeping it alive by trawling through all the stuff that 's out there and posting only the stuff that was really , * really * great . 
  very few people were posting their own stories directly on here or taking existing lesser-quality material . 
  the subreddit kinda changed from an archive of the best stories available into a general rpg story sharing place , which necessarily means the average quality reduces . 
  that is such a perfect description of of seasons 5 and 6 . 
  but after harmon came back the show was * worse * than the season where they fired him , which was in turn worse than before they fired him . 
  you should ** really ** try to work on your formatting . 
  even just using headings and such would help immensely , but the best thing you could do is post it up on [ the homebrewery ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ ) . 
  also the eldritch knight and arcane trickster are * one third * casters . 
  there 's no such thing , so far , as a quarter caster . 
  what do you mean by `` pretty common '' ? 
  it 's common to see a lefty , or it 's commonly seen as an advantage ? 
  because i think that there was only ever one other lefty at my fencing club in the five and a half years i was there , so i would n't have called it common in the former sense . 
  so , in terms of `` more useful '' , in practice it 's a meaningless term . 
  the difference between the actual programme of software engineering versus computer science is * entirely * down to the specific university . 
  at my uni , computer science is basically just softeng lite . 
  if you 're capable of softeng , you 'd be making an objectively bad decision to do compsci . 
  at other unis , the relation is probably reversed , and at some they might be more or less peers . 
  in theory , the difference is the same as any difference between science and engineering . 
  one is focussed on research and developing new ideas , while the other is about taking those ideas and applying them in new and interesting situations . 
  both are incredibly important fields but have different applications . 
  my comment at the end was simply that in general if you can go around using the title of `` engineer '' , that sounds more prestigious than `` scientist '' does , it has basically no impact either in theory or in practice on the knowledge and capability gained . 
  glorified hate speech ? 
  no , their subreddit makes normal hate speech * look * glorified . 
  i would also like a mirror if possible . 
  unfortunately sideways is such a small channel that it 's unlikely ... 
   if other files from the same site download just fine, 
  it could also be that for some reason the `` site '' uses different domains for some different files , and some of those domains work better than others . 
  in a legal sense , `` published '' does n't mean `` published in a physical book through a publisher '' , it just means `` presented to the world '' . 
  strictly speaking , republishing those would be just as much of an issue as republishing ua material is . 
  the only difference is that wizards is less likely to go after republished ua stuff because they have nothing to gain -- they have no demonstrable losses , since it 's both free and ad-free to access from their site and this one . 
  really ? 
  just ... how ? 
  it 's * unplayably * bad . 
  i forced myself to get through the base game and the small add-ons because the story was good , but by the time i got to awakening i was just so burnt out on it that i gave up entirely . 
  its story was good , but not good enough to keep slugging through the gameplay . 
  whereas with the witcher i feel the gameplay is * just * better enough to reach over that threshold . 
  wtf ? 
  i 'm guessing / r/soundtracks is trending thanks to [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvww2fs ) about modern film soundtracks and what they 're doing wrong and why . 
  [ this thread ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 52uiwe/the _ problem_with_marvel_scores / ) on / r/classicalmusic probably is n't the * reason * for its trending , but it 's the highest quality discussion i 've found about the video . 
  you could use throwing weapons . 
  just kidding , i would n't wish that fate upon my worst enemy . 
  i thought the second season was vastly inferior to the first to be honest . 
  i 'd agree with you regarding fisk and the first season , though . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 5 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  best of luck . 
  it also completely goes against what he had literally * just said * about * suggestion * under the `` spellcasting '' heading . 
  god , someone needs to make a less horrible template for goblins that actually * looks like a goblin * ... 
  utc , not ust . 
  no such thing as ust . 
  there are some minor technical details that make the two not * technically * the same , but for all practical intents and purposes yes , utc is the same as gmt . 
  you forgot to include a link . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  i thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters , but the game mechanics were just ... * awful * ... to put it simply . 
  i managed to force myself to get through it for the story , and i 'm glad i did , but by the time i got to the end i was just sick of it . 
  i played maybe 30 minutes of the awakening expansion and i have n't played it since . 
  if you 're playing for the first time , i would really strongly recommend putting it on easy mode . 
  the mechanics will still be horrible to deal with , but at least this way you 'll only have to do each fight once or twice , and you can get on with experiencing the pretty good story and interacting with the really great characters . 
  i played on pc . 
  unfortunately it 's our currency that 's done it . 
  back when the n4 and 5 came out we were at or * above * parity with the usd . 
  now the aud has fallen back to normal levels , everything american is 20-30 % more expensive . 
  correct, 
  you seem to have replied to the wrong person . 
  but i agree , mass effect is ** by far ** the superior game out of the two . 
  i think you 're right that that 's part of the reason i did n't enjoy it , but at the same time i * did * enjoy that aspect of mass effect , so i do n't think that 's the * only * problem with da . 
  i find it really odd that you would value perception as mechanically higher than other skills . 
  i would find about a quarter of the other skills more frequently useful than perception . 
  in terms of the rules there 's no special quality that means perception should be considered different to any other skill . 
  fly speed 50 with a restriction on armour is ** certainly not ** worth +4 . 
  * maybe * +2 if you 're being particularly harsh . 
  the fact that lucky only comes into effect on a natural 1 makes it hard to call it more than +1 . 
  other than those points , i think this is a wonderful piece of work and a vast improvement over the existing scale . 
   a [ any character other than wizard ] getting +1 to intelligence is likely not very useful either, 
  ftfy, 
  since you would not be describing the actual abilities themselves , i think you could safely add * all * the races . 
  just leave it vague . 
  say +2 / +1 asi instead of being specific about * which * stats they 're getting . 
  say `` cantrip , 1st lvl spell , 2nd lvl spell '' instead of specifying * which * spells they are getting . 
  as long as you make it impossible to use this to actually * play * the race without buying the phb , you can * easily * justify it as the `` critique and criticism '' aspect of fair use . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try asking at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to ask questions about game ideas . 
   everyone 's game experience varies , but i 've heard the opinion that perception is the best skill many times . 
  sure , but the fact that people 's experiences vary makes it seem really odd to me to have * one * be mechanically weighted as worth more than others . 
  regarding flight , i mainly find it odd that it would be worth such a high amount . 
  literally more than double the next best thing you can get outside of asis ? 
  no way . 
  and yeah , lucky is a really fun feature to have , but it 's not actually worth a lot . 
  if we assume that a roll of 9 or higher would count as a success ( after modifiers are taken into account ) , lucky gives you an extra 3 % chance of succeeding . 
  not really a lot . 
  to use the language of your document , it 's `` frequently useful '' , but it 's not really `` very powerful '' , so i would say it * exactly * meets the criteria of a +1 feature .
