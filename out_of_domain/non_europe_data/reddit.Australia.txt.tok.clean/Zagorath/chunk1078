  oooh , that 's a much more well-reasoned argument than i was presenting . 
  i thought the punisher was just about the worst part of the season . 
  i normally like that sort of anti-hero character , but the punisher did n't come across as a cool dark character that you can root for , he just came across as an arrogant murderous prick . 
  he engendered no sympathy from me and i was not interested in how his character developed .

  tool proficiencies are a separate part of backgrounds to skills . 
  you get two skill proficiencies no matter what . 
  tools can be substituted for * language * proficiency , but not skill . 
  your argument would make sense if there were a disparity in cost between tools and languages , or one tool and another tool ( and certainly there 's a reasonable argument to be made that thieves ' tools are more valuable than cobblers ' -- the difference there being that there are actual game mechanics dealing with thieves ' tools , and not cobblers ' , while * all * skills have some specific uses laid out ) . 
  that seems reasonable to me . 
  there 's such a disparity in value among the feats that i think trying to * exactly * nail down how much it 's worth is kind of a fruitless exercise , so arbitrarily going on `` gut feel '' is probably the best way to go . 
  true that . 
   considering bruce is arguably the deuteragonist, 
  i could be wrong , but i get the impression that he was originally meant to be a much smaller role . 
  either because of mazouz 's performance or fan reception , or some combination of the two , i think they decided to expand it quite a bit as the show went on . 
  it 's certainly possible that this was their intent all along , though . 
  anybody know why the package name seems to be com.google.android.apps .

  this is obviously parody , but i 'll respond very briefly as though it was serious . 
  my phone does n't support usb otg . 
  i could get a keyboard that supports usb otg , but it still would n't help because my phone ca n't use it . 
  that 's good to know , but i suspect it 's going to be a non-starter . 
  people will have already written it off when they see they ca n't use it on their computer straight away . 
  the cactus dragon , it 's the quenchiest !, 
   we do n't need a piebiscite, 
  maybe not , but i would n't mind a biscuit with my pie . 
  it 's an unusual combination , but not an unwelcome one . 
  actually the german nazi party was rather centrist on economic matters . 
  they were just really , * really * extreme authoritarian . 
  [ sounds like you have a new show you need to watch . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avatar:_the_last_airbender ), 
  it 's a reference . 
  ( quenchiest , though , is a made-up word for a minor gag in one episode of the show , albeit one which is very memorable . 
  it 's used as a word derived from the verb `` to quench '' , meaning `` to sate one 's thirst '' . ), 
  the nazis were actually rather centrist in terms of economics , at least according to the creators of the political compass ( which is what was linked to by the user above ) . 
  left-authoritarian tends to be the quadrant reserved for proper communists like the soviet union . 
  in more moderate doses , that quadrant is where you get many left-leaning racist conservatives , like a few of the minor parties in australia . 
  one nation 's economic policies are n't entirely clear , but they * could * end up in that quadrant . 
  i might suggest that it 's not so much extreme vs moderate as it is the x = y line versus the x = - y line , on the political compass . 
  yes , if you go * really * extreme even the x = y line can be problematic , but even a small venture into the right-libertarian or left-authoritarian quadrants tends to result in utter nonsense . 
  oh damn , you must have gotten * really * close to the episode in question , then . 
  s02e11 `` the desert '' is the one with the cactus juice . 
  do it the way python ( admittedly not a loosely typed language -- a strong but dynamic one ) deals with division . 
  if it gets two integers , division is integer division . 
  if either of them are floats , it switches to floats . 
  if js gets all numbers , it should sort numerically . 
  if it gets a single string , coerce all data to strings and sort alphabetically . 
  lucky is worth an extra 3 % chance of succeeding on a task you already had 60 % chance of succeeding . 
  the easier the task , the more it 's worth , but its limit is just under an extra 5 % ( if 2 would have meant you succeeded ) , which is equivalent to +1 . 
  the harder the task , the less it 's worth , such that if only an 18 would have succeeded , it 's worth 0.75 % . 
  really very little . 
  i always found this requirement ** infuriating ** in high school ict classes . 
  just ... * why * . 
   this guy, 
  yeah , the best stories can be found at [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) and on the [ most upvoted ] ( / r/dndgreentext/top ? sort = top & t = all ) . 
  it 's the same as in any country . 
  in america you might make a joke about why would someone go to one of those weird states right in the middle of the country . 
  the north vs south thing is again the same as many countries have . 
  the south is seen as the more affluent area -- it 's where london is , after all -- whereas the north is the poorer area , with manufacturing typically having been there in cities like manchester and liverpool . 
  it 's really easy to pick this sort of thing up from context clues and some basic geographical knowledge -- i certainly would n't know this otherwise , i 'm not english . 
  one other thing i 'll point out from wilty is the use of the term `` middle class '' . 
  again from context clues ( specifically , how lee mack uses it to describe david mitchell ) , it seems that the english use that term in a way that an american or aussie might use `` upper class '' , or `` posh '' . 
  presumably to them the `` upper class '' is * exclusively * the aristocracy , while the middle class is the more wealthy , affluent group likely to affect an air of poshness . 
  the bourgeoisie , if you will . 
  oh by the gods , i have found my people !,

  why not pin that one ? 
  fake diamonds are marked as fake . 
  it 's also legal to trade in diamonds . 
  the idea with fake ivory is to sell it on the black market as the real thing . 
  because it 's an illegal trade to begin with , regulation and certification are n't a thing you have to worry about . 
  quickly please , it 's important to my saving throw dc . 
  i played schubert 's unfinished symphony one time while i was in high school . 
  i was n't super familiar with it at the time , so when i was given a part with two pages in it and it ended abruptly -- no final bar line , no clear cadence , it just stopped -- i did n't even question it . 
  it was n't until the middle of the first full orchestra rehearsal , when i got confused that everyone kept playing after the point my sheet ran out , that i realised what had happened . 
  yeah , i was just missing the final page of the part . 
  sorry , i did n't make that clear . 
  your title reminded me of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7o0mfkmpw ) . 
  i used [ dispostable ] ( http://www.dispostable.com/ ) to sign up . 
  it seems like it 's lacking * a lot * of basic obvious features . 
  weather is another one . 
  i would hate to have to live somewhere that it regularly goes below 10 \u00b0 , for example . 
  i want warm ( mid-to-high 20s ) summers and mild ( mid to high 10s ) winters , ideally . 
  too far from the tropics is just ... no thank you . 
  8.3 the president is elected by stv . 
  seeing as it by necessity a single-winner election , it would be more appropriate to term it by instant-runoff . 
  why change from the title of governor-general to president ? 
  especially seeing as the state equivalent of the position would continue to be governor . 
  i also worry that such a change would unnecessarily invite a politicisation of the position . 
  yes , this method by which the president is chosen is clearly the best option , but simply by virtue of the name changing , a certain degree of history and convention will be lost . 
  the powers of the governor-general are already theoretically quite considerable , and keeping the name the same would maintain a maximum of the current convention of not exercising those powers . 
  it 's not a * huge * deal , since being elected in such a non-partisan manner would help a lot , but it 's worth considering . 
  is perhaps the worst of the options . 
  a directly elected president who is nevertheless supposed to remain non-partisan ? 
  not a chance . 
  he 'd have that considerable theoretical power , but by virtue of being elected , would likely end up wielding it .
