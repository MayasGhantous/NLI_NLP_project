  we 'd end up with a system like that of the us before the century is out . 
  also , it has that stv problem like 8 does . 
  yeah , they renamed it macos with the latest version , which apparently just came out a couple of days ago . 
  that 's also probably why they 're trending today . 
  ( so yeah , it 's gone from mac os to mac os x , to os x , and now back -- ish -- to macos ), 
  that 's also why os x was pronounced `` oh ess ten '' , not `` oh ess ex '' . 
  april ? 
  no , this thing is some serious oscar-worthy stuff . 
  it 's coming out with the oscar bait in november . 
  not by people who know what they 're talking about it was n't . 
  / u/fezzywadjichka deleted his account :(, 
  the term governor can be applied to a non royally appointed office , as demonstrated by both the united states and this draft . 
  i fail to see why governor-general can not similarly be repurposed . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because of the image host you linked to . 
  it 's actually a banned site on reddit . 
  could you please re-upload the image to another image host such as imgur and then let us know so we can approve the comment and allow others to see it ? 
  thanks .

   without further a due, 
  just for what it 's worth , the expression is `` without further * ado * '' . 
  about something that is unimportant '' . 
  the same word that 's used in the title of the shakespeare play `` much ado about nothing '' . 
  hi , reddit does n't like link shorteners , and this has been caught in the automatic spam filter . 
  could you please change the goo.gl links into full links to their source , so that we can approve it ? 
  thanks . 
  in french , and possibly some other languages , this is considered the correct way to write . 
  presumably most people you see doing this are second language speakers , and are just assuming that things work the same in english as they do in their language . 
  i know i frequently make the mistake of * not * doing that when i 'm writing in french , and i have to stop and double-check i 've done things correctly . 
  same thing for quotation marks ( `` the french use these where we would use double inverted commas .

  additionally , reddit 's syntax requires a blank line between paragraphs , otherwise it displays as a single block paragraph .

  i would suggest keeping darkvision as it is . 
  it 's clearly used by wizards as a cheap basic feature to throw in to most races , so i think increasing its value too much would go against the intentions of the 5e creators . 
  darkvision is worth 0.5 , superior darkvision is worth an extra 0.5 on top of that , but is cancelled out by the sunlight sensitivity . 
  i would also suggest become acquainted with the / u/jwbjerk `` detect balance '' scale , which can be found [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) . 
  it was released quite recently and it 's mostly the same as the musicus scale , but with some slight tweaks in a few areas to make it feel more appropriate . 
  most notably : precise values on how valuable different types of resistances are worth , and specific rules for increasing value due to flexibility ( this race 's asi would be +3.25 under the detect balance rules ) or decreasing them due to poor synergy . 
  it 's still not * perfect * , but i would go so far as to say it is objectively an improvement on the musicus system . 
  edit : wait , hmm , it seems to have dramatically changed since the last time i looked at it . 
  previously it used the same basic scale as the musicus system where an asi is worth +1 ( which makes sense logically ) . 
  it seems to be using some other system now . 
  might be worth holding off on getting to know it until that 's fixed ... 
  ahhhh !!!, 
  what happened to it, 
  the values have gone all weird . 
  everything has suddenly become crazy high values !, 
  edit :, 
  okay , i get it now . 
  it 's just been multiplied by 4 . 
  i am not a fan of this , and i do n't think it 's * entirely * due to disliking change , though that is certainly a part of it : we have , after all , been using the musicus scale for a long time now and the previous detect balance iteration maintained most compatibility with that . 
  it was much easier to remember `` okay , these are the exact values of different damage resistances now , rather than needing to kinda guestimate for different types '' and `` okay , flexibility in asis gives a bonus of 0.25 compared to what i 'm used to '' , than it is to remember a whole new system . 
  and when the system is fundamentally the same but just multiplied by 4 i have to wonder * what 's the point ? 
  but there 's also the matter that making an asi worth exactly 1 gives you a simple objective easy-to-remember baseline by which things can be measured . 
  there 's also the advantage of small numbers leading to tighter bounds . 
  when you use smaller numbers , an increase of +1 is worth a lot , and people come to recognise this . 
  1 is a special number that 's easy to remember . 
  if you were to break from +1 , having a significant value increase of +10 would probably be a pretty easy mental benchmarks to use , but +4 just comes across as ... off , and i think it 'll be harder to remember . 
  when something is worth +0.25 , that 's a value that really * feels * like it 's intrinsically not worth much . 
  if it 's worth +1 , and the basic value is +4 , it feels like it 's worth a lot more . 
  hmm , this made me think that a dragon rider prestige class -- with a minimum level requirement of 10 , as well as a roleplay requirement to get a young dragon to befriend you -- could be a really cool idea . 
  my friend had an idea for how to make monks more interesting , but it 's not a fully fleshed-out idea , just a vague concept . 
  the idea was that you 'd build up combos somehow . 
  one attack would be a fairly low-powered one , while successive attacks on multiple turns would get more and more powerful . 
  whether that 's by ramping up damage , or granting a to-hit bonus , or something else , would have to be designed into it . 
  i would probably suggest that the level 5 ability should be more of a basic damage booster , just like the other conclaves get . 
  either extra attack or something designed to be mostly equivalent to it . 
  i 'm unsure about the spell preparation thing . 
  on the one hand it seems like quite a substantial boost , so maybe it should be a higher level ability . 
  but on the other hand , something that changes the class so fundamentally seems like it should perhaps be added as early as possible , and could maybe be reduced to form part of the 3rd level ability . 
  oh yeah , that 's a really clever idea . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
  one just needs to look at the way wizards has used it : throwing it out cheaply onto nearly everything . 
  not to mention that the races * without * it are nearly universally regarded as the mechanically weakest * already * , and if one considers darkvision as being stronger , that disparity can only get worse . 
  no matter which way one looks at it , it 's clear that it should n't be worth very much . 
  even increasing its value from 0.5 to 0.75 feels like a stretch . 
  australia uses a form of cockney rhyming slang all the time . 
  just because it 's using that basic construction does n't necessarily mean the term `` seppo '' or `` septic '' to refer to americans is n't australian . 
  what matters in this case is , was it a brit or an australian who first decided to start using that ? 
  and also important , where was the term most frequently used when it was new ? 
  i do n't know the answer to those questions , only that the mere fact that it derives from a rhyme does not give london sole rights to it . 
  while i thoroughly enjoyed the story , i did n't really enjoy the gameplay of portal 2 nearly as much as the first . 
  the goos just never really gelled with me the way the portal gun did , and solving the puzzles felt way more tedious . 
  probably did n't help that in a lot of them , the a big part of the challenge was finding the small white area where you could lay down your portals to solve the problem , whereas the original you could put them nearly anywhere and the challenge was finding the * right * places to get where you wanted . 
  i do n't know whether i 'm disappointed or impressed that you used the episode 1 intro as your template here rather than the normal one . 
  2920 days `` do we remember 4th october 2016 ? '', 
  man do n't let all the negative nancies in this thread get you down . 
  i thought this was really cool . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  for a reddit app , keeping anything in the cache more than a day is unnecessary . 
  other apps may benefit from longer term caches , but an app focussed on interactions with a quickly updating website has no need for that . 
  [ the vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) is one of the highest reviewed pieces of content on / r/boh5e -- a subreddit dedicated to high-quality in-depth reviews of the best homebrew out there . 
  [ the ice queen warlock patron ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 4dzetu/ice _ queen_patron_by_ujonoman3000 / ) is another very well-made piece . 
  both of these have some really tight well-designed balance , while still managing to get a really interesting bit of flavour that strongly reinforces the theme of the class . 
  in addition , of course , to being an interesting theme to begin with . 
  i would suggest that / r/boh5e is always the best place to go to look for homebrew material first , followed by / r/unearthedarcana if nothing there suits you . 
  ua is great because unlike most other places , it has a strong culture of review and improvement unlike , say , the dungeon master 's guild , where people throw up all sorts of terrible shit .
