  on ua you can easily see where people have been given feedback and used it to make something better , and if they 've done that you know it 's probably a pretty good piece of homebrew . 
  not in an actual sage advice column as far as i can tell , but [ mearls did tweet that his ruling would be you can ] ( http://www.sageadvice.eu/2014/11/03/monk-moves-between-flurry/ ) . 
  not an official ruling by crawford , but better than nothing . 
  [ here 's another little tweet chain that seems to say more or less the same thing . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/mikemearls/status/501391130421121027 ) again , mearls not crawford . 
  that 's another good reason for it , though . 
  if you always put the * lid * down , then everyone is equal . 
  everyone has to lift it up before using the toilet , and everyone has to put it down afterwards . 
  no more disputes over whether the seat is up or down . 
  yeah , i noticed that after i left the comment . 
  to be honest i 'm not a fan of the change . 
  the larger numbers seem to make the maths less ... intuitive , i guess ? 
  it 's hard to describe . 
   it is the proper name of our sun, 
  nope . 
  this is a weirdly common misconception , probably spread thanks to star trek and other science fiction . 
  the proper name for our sun is `` the sun '' . 
  scientists do n't , in this case , use the latin . 
  to start off with , from a realism perspective your choice of weapons does n't make a lot of sense . 
  the three swords used in modern sport fencing bear little resemblance to real weapons that were used , being far more light-weight and flexible than would make an effective weapon . 
  however , the sabre and \u00e9p\u00e9e are probably mostly okay as they are . 
  the foil , however , is not . 
  the foil derived as a training weapon for the smallsword . 
  the smallsword is , despite most popular imagery , the best real-world representation for what d&d has mechanically statted as `` short sword '' . 
  basically , a foil should , from a realism perspective , be a short sword , doing 1d8 damage . 
  from a mechanical standpoint , this seems a bit strong . 
  it gains * a lot * of power at 3rd level . 
  ignoring shields , attacking enemies 10 ft. away , and moving faster ? 
  ** wow ** . 
  the other two options start getting advantage * far * too cheaply for my taste , too . 
  most other fighter archetypes get a feature that benefits the interaction or exploration pillars of the game at 7th level , while all the other benefits they gain are combat . 
  the eldritch knight is an exception to this , so yours would n't be the * first * to break from that convention , but the ek is also generally thought of as a pretty weak option anyway , so in some ways gaining that extra combat ability is a concession to that . 
  i would suggest moving strength of character to 7th level . 
  it seems odd to me that your main-gauche has no way of providing a defensive bonus unless the user is wielding an \u00e9p\u00e9e . 
  considering the main purpose of a main-gauche is typically to improve defence , this strikes me as poor design . 
  i would suggest gauche techniques all be about some kind of defensive boost . 
  perhaps in a slightly different way for each of them , or perhaps all getting the same bonus . 
  daaaymmnn . 
  that last photo is absolutely gorgeous !, 
  would you mind if i added it to my rotation of wallpapers ? 
  i do n't even need to watch it to know what scene that is . 
  the one where he 's in lois lane 's apartment and he 's about to tell her who he is , and then just before she comes in he changes his mind . 
  right ? 
  there is another element to it , which is that most people do n't even think of superman as * having * an alter-ego in the way a masked vigilante must . 
  he 's this super powerful , larger than life figure . 
  why would he * need * an alter-ego ? 
  besides , he does n't even bother wearing a mask !, 
  there must be nothing to hide , right ? 
  that , combined with just how dramatically different clark kent is from superman , and it 's easy to see how people did n't put two and two together . 
  oh shit those were bees !, 
  i thought it was moss or some other kind of plant the first time i looked ... 
  and 2 is romeo & juliet . 
  because r&j is the * completely * logical follow up to hamlet . 
  people also forget the 5 million non-jews that were killed . 
  the homosexuals , the romani , some norwegian educators who refused to teach nazi propaganda , etc. 
  they made up over 45 % of the civilians executed by the nazi regime , but popular culture completely ignores them for the most part . 
  not that the genocide of the jewish people is n't also horrible , but it 's kinda sad that we 've collectively forgotten about everyone else . 
  so the german chancellor is much like the prime minister in a westminster-based system ( like most of the commonwealth ) ? 
  i 'll be honest , this thread is the first time i even realised germany * had * a president ; i thought the chancellor was both the de facto * and * de jure head of state . 
  what 's their role , and how are they selected ? 
  i 'm guessing they play a role similar to that of the governor-general or the monarch in westminster countries ? 
  technically the most powerful position , but by convention they do not exercise any real power ? 
  in the dcau i 'm pretty sure supes wore a spacesuit while flying in space , so there 's that . 
  lovely composition on that photo . 
   a good portion of fanfiction is about exploring sex and romance between various characters , which is hard when the entire main cast is related to one another . 
  please , have you ever * been * on the internet ? 
  like that would stop them ... 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know the french equivalent swear to `` what the fuck '' , but serious , what the fuck . 
  seriously , why the fuck would anyone think this is a good idea ? 
  ( pardon my poor french , i have n't spoken it since highschool ... ), 
  oh my god . 
  i 've just looked up [ this hall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salle_pleyel ) . 
  this is the place that saw the premiere of ravel 's pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte , and two of saint-sa\u00ebns ' piano concertos . 
  a piece of musical history has been lost here .

  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
   the parallel universe where goatees are in style is just one of an infinite number of possible parallel universes, 
  actually , the parallel universes where goatees are in style are just an infinite number of the possible parallel universes . 
  the many-worlds interpretation is weird . 
  if you do want to ask people to gauge interest , [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 52e8hw/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) is probably the best place to ask . 
  though with that said , it 's due to be refreshed tomorrow , so you might get a wider audience if you wait until the new thread goes up . 
  where you are within your time zone is also * really * important . 
  assuming the * centre * of the time zone is the `` exact '' point , being as far east in that time zone as you can go makes 5 am more like 5:30 . 
  but even so , i find your story * really * hard to believe . 
  i live in brisbane australia , which has a latitude roughly half way between miami and houston usa , and at * this time of year * ( early-mid spring ) it 's noticeably light out at by around 5:30 am . 
  in another few months it 'll be almost daylight out . 
  i do n't find it hard to believe at all that some combination of longitude within time zone , time of year , and latitude would result in it being pretty light out within the usa before 5 . 
  since when was `` to princess '' a verb ? 
  and what does it even mean ? 
  msy too . 
  but you ca n't browse them , you need to know precisely what you want when you go in . 
  what the fuck are you buying from amazon in the us that 's anywhere * near * reasonable ? 
  everything i 've looked at that i want either does n't ship here * at all * or wants to charge ludicrous amounts for shipping such that it 's clearly not just `` shipping '' cost , but actually a stealthy profit maker that they do n't have to advertise . 
  damn , now i feel like a hipster for having been playing it longer than that . 
  google is finally old enough to drink !, 
  unfortunately , not in its home country , but still ...
