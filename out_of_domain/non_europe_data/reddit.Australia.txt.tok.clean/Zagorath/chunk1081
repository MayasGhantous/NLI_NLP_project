  hmm , odd . 
  could that be because of daylight saving , perhaps ? 
  it could artificially be making it * seem * like the sun is rising much later than it actually is . 
  if you 've got daylight saving and the earliest sunset is 5:07 , the sun is * actually * rising at 4:07 but your clock is wrong . 
  so yeah , i do n't know whether the law is vague or the reporting on it has been vague . 
  if it 's the latter , then i commend the lawmakers for at least knowing exactly what they are doing , which is more than can be said for many lawmakers . 
  but i strongly suspect that whoever was in charge of making this rule is the moron here , and the rule probably is actually as vague as it sounds . 
  it 's the exact sort of myopia that i would expect of someone who thinks it 's a good idea to ban the music in any way . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because you linked to an image on quickmeme . 
  it 's actually a banned site on reddit . 
  could you please re-upload the image to another image host such as imgur and then let us know so we can approve the comment and allow others to see it ? 
  thanks . 
  cheers .

  edit : [ screenshot of the process ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tf3xqep.png ), 
  `` brutal '' is actually a term that has been used in previous editions . 
  a brutal 1 weapon allows you to reroll a damage die if you roll a 1 . 
  brutal 2 is the same but for 1s and 2s , etc. 
  it 's a bit less powerful than what you 've suggested , but i think it would be more balanced ( i do think that doubling the damage modifier is too powerful for a basic weapon trait ) , as well as allowing people already familiar with the terms to not need to adjust . 
  if you 're going to be adding modal , the rapier is another weapon that should have it -- arguably more so than the short sword . 
  savage seems pretty unredeemable to me . 
  that 's powerful enough to be an uncommon ( at least ) magic item . 
  how accurate , exactly , is your username ? 
  but wow , how did that not get snagged until * eight months * ago,

  feel free to ask around for ideas in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) but outside events and [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  is there a size category smaller than tiny ? 
  because there should be , and flies should be in that . 
  i completely misread your brutal ability . 
  did n't notice that it 's only on crits . 
  in that case , it 's * not * crazy overpowered as it is . 
  in fact , in terms of balance your brutal is * slightly * less powerful than 4e 's brutal 1 . 
  in some extreme circumstances , it 's * very * slightly more powerful . 
  below are two examples on the more extreme ends of damage possible , as well as the maths involved in calculating them ( so someone can verify in case i made an error ) . 
  i will say , however , that to be honest i do n't think that * any * of the three properties you proposed should be things added on to weapons as basic traits . 
  the weapons in the phb are mostly a very well-balanced bunch and they really do n't need extra mechanics to make them better . 
  your ideas work * great * for minor benefits to be added on to especially well-crafted ( but not magical ) weapons , sort of like `` masterwork '' weapons from previous editions , i believe . 
  in fact , in that respect , i might borrow some of your ideas for my own campaigns . 
  but to simply add them on to all weapons , they are too powerful . 
  your brutal will do an amortised average damage of 8.8 per attack assuming 2d6 weapon , +4 modifier , a 75 % chance of hitting , and crits only on 20 . 
  a 4e brutal 1 weapon will deal an amortised average of 9.4 under the same conditions . 
  with a 1d8 weapon and a +5 modifier , and crits on 19 , they become 8.075 and 8.0 respectively . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try asking at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to ask questions about game ideas . 
  hey just a tip , when you see a post that breaks the rules , do n't hesitate to hit the `` report '' button . 
  it means the mods will be alerted to it and respond more quickly . 
  the problem is that the great club and trident are * only * strictly inferior in mostly insubstantial ways . 
  literally any mechanical benefit added on top of them and they become by far superior options out of proportion with other weapons . 
  the only thing making great club inferior to the quarterstaff is the latter 's versatility . 
  the only reason the trident is inferior to the spear is that it is martial . 
  weapons in general are * really * tightly balanced . 
  for the most part , you can predict exactly what something 's damage will be based only on knowing what traits it has . 
  the trident is the only real exception to this , and one could argue that it should either have been a simple weapon or 1d8/1d10 versatile without throwing ( a piercing longsword , essentially ) ; or maybe let it keep throwing , but be 1d6 for that . 
  but if you were to add on the sorts of features you 've described in this post as a basic feature , it throws the balance completely out . 
  this is a feature that i * believe * dorico should solve in a very elegant way once it comes out . 
  for now , however , using an ossia staff in sibelius should do the job . 
  nothing that 's overpowered is going to `` bring the whole system crashing down '' . 
  it 's just bad design . 
  and that 's what these are , if they 're applied indiscriminately : overpowered and badly designed . 
  tasty chip snacks with cheese powder on them . 
  dorico is competing music scoring program developed by steinberg . 
  many of the developers on the team are people that were on the original sibelius team before avid fired them and replaced them with cheaper overseas labour . 
  many in the industry have been eagerly awaiting it for a few years , and the little previews that they 've given out make it look like it will be vastly superior to sibelius or finale , which have both been rather stagnant for a long time now . 
  a few months ago they finally announced it will be released q4 this year . 
  to be honest , when i need to write in french ( which is not very often for me , so this solution is an easy option for me but not so much for a native speaker who uses it frequently ) i make sure i 'm using macos . 
  i use the normal dvorak layout and use option keys to get accents . 
  option-e and a vowel gives an acute , option - ` and a vowel gives a grave , and u and i are the circumflex and umlaut ( but i forget which is which ) . 
  it 's a really simple intuitive method that gives you access or not only to accents , \u00e7 , and french quote marks , but also useful symbols that can be used in any language like \u00a9 , \u2122 , em and en dashes , the degree symbol , and ellipses . 
  given its flexibility , i 'm sure there would have to be some way to replicate this behaviour on linux , but my attempts to do so have so far failed . 
  windows , i suspect , is not possible unfortunately . 
  if anyone knows of a way to replicate macos 's option key behaviour in linux ( specifically debian/ubuntu-like flavours ) i would * very * much appreciate it . 
  i found out in another thread that apparently something happened a year or two ago that caused a massive spike in m&b 's popularity . 
  ice been playing for * way * longer than that , so i already feel like one of those hipster arses ( except for the fact that , you know , i only ever bring it up in meta threads like this one and that one ) . 
  so what you 're saying is that later games in the dragon age franchise do away with the absolutely * shit * mechanics of the first game , but keep the same incredible lore ? 
  i might have to go back to the franchise and try it again ... 
  to be honest i thought it was a lot weaker than this season 's premiere . 
  still good , but i thought last week 's was great . 
  holy shit i just visited it and that is amazing . 
  from the name i was honestly expecting it to be sarcastic : a subreddit for really terrible examples of hitboxes . 
  oh awesome , thanks . 
  i guess i 'll give the later games a go . 
  i * loved * the story of da :o , but found the mechanics so dull that i really struggled to get through the whole game even when i turned it onto easy so i did n't have to redo fights over and over again . 
  i eventually got through it , but could n't bring myself to finish the awakening expansion because i was so sick of the combat . 
  if the later games take a more me approach to combat , i think i 'll probably enjoy them much more , because i * loved * the gameplay in me . 
  wizards can be pretty damn good at it if they 're allowed to be bladesingers . 
  they can get an ac of 13 + 1 + int + dex if they use * mage armour * and the dual weapons feat ( the spellsinging restriction is only on * attacking * with two weapons , not wielding them to begin with ) . 
  at 10th level they can even start reducing the damage they take using their spell slots . 
  with a necromancer also in the party to suck up attacks and gain extra attacks per turn , wizards become really powerful and the only thing really lacking is healing . 
  they 're probably not on the same tier as clerics and druids ( though i question the placement of bards in that tier ) , but they are not to be underestimated , either . 
  i think security is one area that everyone should be aware of , because like it or not it 's directly affecting * everyone * . 
  you can start with a basic overview of what hashing is and how it works , then go on to explain how this is used with salts to create good password storage , and why that means a reputable site should never be able to give you back your password in text . 
  from there , you can launch into a description of what makes a good secure hashing algorithm , explain how long an attack will take , and what measures users can take to protect themselves ( password managers and 2fa , mainly ) . 
  depending on time , maybe discuss how much of a risk social engineering is and how lax many companies are regarding it . 
  wait i thought that was underwood 's campaign .
