   all states would have to change at once . 
  well , no . 
  like you just said , all you need is for similarly sized states to pair off . 
  you can get two states switching at a time . 
  bike paths exist in a few places . 
   in short , unless it 's a dedicated cycle-only path , then cyclists give way to * everyone * else . 
  what ? 
  when using the road , cyclists follow mostly the same laws as other road users . 
  a car behind them must not overtake unless safe to do so , and the cyclist has no responsibility to ride out of their way to allow them to do so . 
  they should certainly ride as far left as is safe , but it 's their judgement how far left that is based on traffic conditions , road conditions , and obstacles that may be on the road . 
  they should also not ride side by side ( even though they are legally entitled to ) if doing so would hold up traffic . 
  but they do * not * ` give way ' to cars on the road any more than other cars do . 
  on pedestrian pavements and shared paths , yes , cyclists should give way to everyone . 
  from 8 pm until noon ? 
  that is a * seriously * long walk . 
  yeah seriously , when i 'm riding at night a have two rear facing lights just to be doubly safe . 
  they 're not expensive , and anything that decreases the chance of me being hit is worth it . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because you linked to quickmeme . 
  it 's actually a banned site on reddit . 
  could you please re-upload the image to another image host such as imgur and then let us know so we can approve the comment and allow others to see it ? 
  thanks .

  i assume all the lines shown are marking of breaks in territory and not rivers ? 
  is this related to the fact that my rss reader ( subscribed to a number of google 's other blogs such as the gmail blog , google chrome blog , etc. ), 
  is suddenly surfacing stories from as far back as 2013 ? 
  unfortunately there are a great many laws that are not sufficiently followed . 
  some of them are more significant than others . 
  for example , cyclists not having a bell is a far less significant infringement in my view than not using lights , since in most cases voice is more effective anyway . 
  as both a pedestrian and a cyclist , it * infuriates * me how often i see cars fail to indicate correctly . 
  either indicating * far * too late when turning and/or changing lanes , or simply not indicating * at all * , or not knowing how to indicate around roundabouts . 
  that 's something that seriously needs to be dealt with . 
  as a clarinetist , i approve of this . 
  ah , that 's problematic , then . 
  the rivers on the north-west island and in the southern half of the north-east island do n't follow logic . 
  in fact , they 're really quite egregiously bad . 
  and there are ones in the northern spirally islands that make even less sense . 
  rivers * always * combine , never split , as they go downhill . 
  in the north-western island , you have a single river that splits four times before it reaches the sea . 
  this rule includes lakes and inland seas . 
  if a river pools into a lake , that lake may have many inlets , but will only have a single outlet . 
  in the north-eastern island your lake has two outlets ( and those then split into 4 parts before reaching the ocean , breaking rule 1 ) . 
  finally , rivers always run downhill , and always take the most direct route . 
  it is impossible for a river to run from ocean to ocean because that could n't be downhill . 
  there are four cases of what appear to be rivers running from the ocean across to the ocean in the northern spiral islands . 
  more generally , while you do n't * need * this per se , it makes for nice appealing looking rivers if you * do * have rivers that combine . 
  all of your rivers run from a single source . 
  they would look far more convincing if you had a number of small sources pooling into the main river as they run through/near the mountains . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  holst 's two suites for concert band are an absolute staple for the ensemble , and in particular [ the fantasia on the dargason ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0y0-mhtkq ) is a great showpiece of the woodwind section . 
  some of the outer planets in his the planets suite also come with great wind parts . 
  similarly , [ vaughn williams ' english folk song suite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0sc4xbyt5c ) for concert band is a lovely piece with a lot of woodwind . 
  but i think my favourite piece with a lot of woodwind is probably [ eric whitacre 's october ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjfrjfapcx0 ) . 
  for orchestral works , i 've always thought that most of beethoven 's symphonies feature some * great * woodwind parts in ways that most other composers do n't . 
  there 's a tendency to lean more on the brass or strings . 
  tchaikovsky is another great composer for wind ; the oboe in swan lake is divine . 
  sorry but i do n't know enough about it to be able to help you . 
  asking on / r/shadowban is probably your best option . 
  i do n't know if there 'd be many on reddit who would be fans of this . 
  it 's much more strongly in favour of the coalition than the real reps. far fewer independents and labor . 
  the only thing going for it is that there 's a second green . 
  worth noting that the geneva conventions were signed in the aftermath of the second world war , specifically because of how many atrocities both sides committed in that conflict . 
  you left off a closing bracket on the link there , so it 's displaying as text and then a link , instead of an embedded link . 
  i have habits as good things that i like to do with no schedule . 
  it 's annoying that the habitrpg engine makes them turn yellow within a day , but i deal with it . 
  ideally they would let you specify a target frequency so that good things i want to do once a week or once a month turn back to yellow with the right speed . 
  but since they do n't , i just get rewarded more than i should . 
  habits are also good for being a method to punish negative behaviours by hitting the minus button . 
  dailies can , ironically , also be used as weeklies . 
  things that need to be done * exactly * on a weekly schedule . 
  i 'm the one that said that , and i am fully aware of how it would work . 
  all i was pointing out was that the hypothetical result in this post , even if it did occur , is not one that most left wing leaning redditors would be in favour of . 
  you did n't specify a subreddit . 
  pffft , this is hilarious . 
  and the english say you guys have no senses of humour !, 
  it 's like , at least one tenth of the posts in / r/brisbane , to be honest . 
  that , and reminders to people to turn on their headlights when it 's raining . 
  i know this sounds like a weird thing to say , but that game looks like basically a clicker game without the clicking . 
   no shave november, 
  when did that name start being used ? 
  it 's such a lame name for the event . 
  movember has a much nicer ring to it . 
  i 'm personally of the opinion that we should move to stv in the reps , or use some form of mmp ( but ** not ** one that involves party lists ) . 
  no single-winner based system can * ever * be a fair representation of the voters ' wishes . 
  however , in the event of wanting single-winner seats and only single-winner seats , i happen to think irv is a perfectly acceptable solution . 
  i * despise * approval voting for the simple fact that expressing a * preference * is and should be an important part of voting , and range is even worse because it * pretends * to be better , but no sane voter would do anything other than give the maximum score -- it devolves into approval , but means an uneducated voter who does n't vote in this way is worth less . 
  `` condorcet voting '' is n't per se a voting system so much as a class of systems , but any system which requires a ballot paper that looks the same as or similar to irv while satisfying the condorcet criterion is fine . 
  i just do n't think the edge cases in which it becomes relevant are significant enough to warrant a change from our current system to that , especially when it would be far better to move to multiple winner electorates anyway . 
  not necessarily worse , because it 's also less important , so having less facilities available is more acceptable . 
  the pain in the arse is n't queensland not having dst , it 's the southern states that * do * have it . 
  if everyone just used the * correct * time , nobody would have any problems .
