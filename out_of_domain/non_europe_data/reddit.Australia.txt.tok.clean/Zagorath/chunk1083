  dst creates problems like the one you described between states . 
  it creates problems with the same kind of type between * countries * ( where telling them to just use dst is even more of a dumb idea than for qld ) . 
  but far , * far * more importantly , it literally * kills people * . 
  the day of the change sees a spike in heart problems , traffic accidents , and suicides . 
  there is also a measurably lower efficiency among workers due to fatigue from having lost an hour of sleep . 
  there is quite frankly no rational way to defend it . 
  it makes no sense , it 's * morally * wrong , and it causes * far * more problems than the tiny made-up/imagined benefits it brings . 
  i also often travel , but i 've never found automatic time zone changes to work correctly , so i always keep my phone set to manually change . 
  it 's never been a problem . 
  the backwards non-progressive hicks are n't queensland , it 's the southern states that * do * have dst . 
  if everyone just used the * correct * time , nobody would have any problems . 
  dst * creates * the communication problems you alluded to between states .

  it is if either you believe in democracy being representative of the will of the people , or you fit into the average demographics of australian subreddits . 
  or at least , two greens is better than what the current parliament looks like in either of those two situations , but it 's still not a good thing , because they are still grossly underrepresented . 
  if they 're completing the mystic , i just hope it feels more like a proper psion than the last version did . 
  it had some good aspects , but damn it was like they just did n't care at all for what makes psionics ... well , psionics . 
  using irv is categorically better than fptp . 
  it 's just that , coincidentally , in this case * one party * would have gotten a number of seats closer to what they should have gotten under a proportional system , which is a better , more democratic way of choosing representatives . 
  it 's a complete coincidence and not a reason for anyone to argue we * should * be going back to fptp . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try asking at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to ask questions about game ideas . 
  a bunch of things . 
  it seems way more like a slight variation on normal spellcasting than the truly unique source of power that psionics should be . 
  you now just get cantrips that scale with level . 
  no spending psi points to make them more powerful , which is supposed to be the core idea of the class . 
  a basic amount of free stuff , which can be increased through psi points . 
  the `` mind thrust '' ability worked ** much ** more like how it should in the * first * mystic draft . 
  it 's not about physically pushing them using your mind , it 's about thrusting * into * their mind with yours . 
  `` thought spear '' seems to have taken over what mind thrust is supposed to be , and they 've changed for no reason . 
  similarly , having it be a saving throw rather than some form of attack roll is really disappointing . 
  taking the * main class damage feature * out of the hands of the player is lame . 
  using their intelligence score like in the first draft was probably too powerful , but making it an attack roll vs. 10 + int mod might work . 
  or even the target 's choice of 10 + int or 10 + wis. 
  this same thing goes for basically all of the damaging cantrip-like abilities . 
  the biggest thing is that first one , though . 
  it should n't feel like spellcasting with a twist . 
  psionics is a completely different unique source of power . 
  sometimes those powers involve casting a spell , but most of the time they do not , and when they do n't they need to really feel different . 
  both of the primary options for proportional representation retain local members . 
  there 's stv , which [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) explains really well , and there 's mmp , [ explained in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu ) . 
  i was unsure about prestige classes based on the rune scribe . 
  personally i was n't a fan of it . 
  but i * would * also ** love ** to see more ideas for prestige classes , because i 've seen a couple of homebrew prcs that i * love * . 
  the format is a really great one for certain use player options . 
  i really hope that they do n't give up on the format entirely based just on the mediocre reception their rune scribe got . 
  the videos answer that very succinctly , as would a basic understanding of different electoral systems . 
   we even have an official definition for such a situation : where the centre of gravity around which the two objects orbit ( the barycentre ) is outside the physical bodies of both objects . 
  how does jupiter factor in to this definition ? 
  we can conceive of binary planets , and binary stars are well known , but how would we classify a binary star/planet system ?

   you succeed if your result is 20 or higher . 
  this dumbs down the system and makes it impossible to have some things that are easy while others are hard . 
   note : use the full ability score , not the ability score modifier . 
  combined with the above , this means * everything * becomes absurdly easy . 
  with an score of 12 , i can now succeed 65 % of the time even in things at which i am not proficient . 
  if i * am * proficient , that goes up to a * minimum * of 75 % of the time , scaling up to 90 % success rate when you get a proficiency of +6 -- and that 's assuming i do n't put any more points into the skill . 
  with just a 16 in the stat ( the basic * starting * point for a character 's primary stat ) , i 'm * autosucceeding * at everything i 'm proficient in by level 9 , and i * start out * succeeding 90 % of the time . 
   exceptionally challenging tasks are rolled with disadvantage . 
  essentially , there are five difficulty levels : easy ( no roll required ) , challenging ( make a roll ) , difficult ( roll with disadvantage ) , formidable ( roll with double disadvantage , i.e. 
  3d20 keep worst ) , and staggering ( automatic failure ) . 
  as a consequence of the above , using disadvantage as the sole determiner of difficulty means that someone who 's good at something will basically be unaffected by something being really hard , while someone who 's not so great at something will be severely impacted . 
  if you have a 90 % chance of succeeding , disadvantage turns that to still over 80 % chance . 
  while if you had a 60 % chance , it goes down to 36 % . 
  further , it removes the semantic meaning of disadvantage , which is n't just that `` this thing is hard '' , but that `` some circumstance is making you less capable of succeeding in this case '' . 
   whomever rolls higher wins, 
  whoever , not whom . 
  would you say `` he rolls higher '' or `` him rolls higher '' ? 
  the difference between who and whom is the same as he and him . 
  when in doubt , just use who , because nobody is ever going to call you out for using who when you should use whom , but doing the opposite makes you sound pretentious if you get it wrong . 
   failing a static skill check by less than than your proficiency bonus allows you to try again, 
  unless your failure changed the situation such that trying again became impossible , you should be able to try again * anyway * . 
  see [ this article ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) for more . 
  but for situations where that logic does n't apply ( knowledge checks , for example ) , your subrule just makes things * even more * impossible to fail . 
  tl ; dr this is a really , * really * bad system . 
  it basically makes everything auto-success for things in which someone is specialised . 
  it does n't do anything better in terms of flavour than the basic system , it completely flies in the face of logic and of 5e design paradigms . 
  it has no reason to exist . 
  what time is that utc ? 
  it would make it way easier for those of us outside america to work out when it is for us . 
  cheers mate . 
  haha yeah , i 'm loving the fact that they 're doing it so early in the morning their time . 
  means it 's reasonable to stay up to watch it , unlike many other events which are like 3 or 4 am here . 
  you are correct . 
  there are some technical/historical reasons that it 's not correct to say that utc = = gmt , but in practice the two serve the same function and are the same time zone . 
  so , from the looks of it this is supposed to be an adventure , am i correct ? 
  it also does n't seem to be in a playable state , and just cuts off after the first little subsection . 
  i am removing this for violating subreddit post requirement 1 .

  any word on this month 's unearthed arcana ? 
  there was talk about what was going to be in it a few days ago , and it 's now well in to the first monday of the month in us time , so i would have expected it out by now .
