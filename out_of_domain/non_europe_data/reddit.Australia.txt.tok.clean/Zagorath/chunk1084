  my personal thoughts :, 
  * the new favoured enemy having all humanoids grouped together is * far * too powerful and should be switched back to 2 sub-types . 
  * the new natural explorer loses substantial interesting flavour in exchange for uniform performance . 
  this may or may not be a bad thing on net . 
  * the change to hide in plain sight seems arbitrary and weird . 
  not * worse * necessarily , but unnecessary . 
  * foe slayer is somewhat disappointing . 
  * a few more options for beasts , including something that can fly , would be nice . 
  the optional damage/hp/cr guidelines are a nice touch , though . 
  [ here is a direct link to the ranger revision in question ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/ua_revisedranger.pdf ) , in case anybody wants to take a second look at it before providing feedback .

  the problem is n't at those crazy high levels though , it 's a major buff at lower levels , where the vast majority of enemies are humanoids . 
  humans * alone * are usually going to be a very powerful choice , but add all of the other civilised races ( elves , dwarves , etc. 
  ) , goblinoids , orcs , kobolds , etc. , and it very quickly becomes obvious just how powerful it is . 
  yes , by far . 
  do n't forget that not only are * all * of the playable races humanoids , but so are orcs , goblinoids , kobolds , merfolk , and many more of the most common low level enemies . 
  oh thank the gods . 
  i was beginning to think i was going crazy or something . 
  like everyone else was playing a completely different game to me . 
  yes , something like that could work quite nicely i think . 
   like , are bugbears and goblins two different choices , or would they fall into the broad category of `` goblinoid , '' and thus count as one choice ? 
  the way i think it should be done in this draft , and the way it is in the phb ranger , is that you go by subtype . 
  goblinoid is one subtype of humanoid . 
  every humanoid monster in the mm ( and elsewhere ) has its subtype listed in brackets after it , and that is what these features apply to . 
  so their `` thing '' is that they 're really good * exclusively * at killing * humanoids * ? 
  because that 's the problem with the option as it is . 
  humanoids are so much better than every other option that it 's very difficult to even consider anything else . 
  it 's not about being overpowered compared to other classes , it 's about being overpowered compared to other options the ranger has . 
  creative commons is a set of copyright licences which are comparatively permissive . 
  with a simple cc-by licence , you are permitted to use it in any way you like , so long as you provide attribution to its creator . 
  other cc licences can require non-commercial use ( which would mean you ca n't use that in a video ) , or that you share any derivative works under the same licence . 
  public domain means all copyright on the work has been lifted . 
  any person can legally use it in any way they please . 
  no attribution or anything else is required . 
  the compositions of most composers who died before the early 20th century are in the public domain . 
  you can play them yourself in any forum , be it public or private , without needing to ask anyone or get permission . 
  and then if you record that performance , you can do anything you want with it . 
  the * recordings * of these pieces are , for the most part , still under copyright . 
  that means you * can not * use these recordings without first getting permission from the publishers . 
  you * may * be able to find a public domain or creative commons recording of the piece you want . 
  but unless you find it specifically with a message declaring it to be so , it 's probably not ok to use it . 
  [archive.org ] ( https://archive.org ) and [ imslp ] ( http://imslp.org/ ) are good places to look for public domain recordings . 
  ( imslp is primarily known as a sheet music sharing site , but does also contain some recordings . ), 
  i 'm guessing they meant * firebolt * ? 
  the breath weapon is that of a dragon * born * pc .

  bst \u2260 gmt . 
  because of the `` summer '' in british summer time , they are currently at utc +1 , whereas gmt is ( for most intents and purposes ) the same as utc ( +0 ) . 
   or will her fiance suddenly decide to live up to the real falcone name ? 
  i absolutely loved that mobster stuff in the first season . 
   im starting to think that that girl isnt his sister, 
  i thought that for a second , too , at the bit where he said `` i love you '' on the rooftop . 
  but then i remembered that he referred to her as his sister in the privacy of his own home the first time we saw him with the picture . 
  if she is n't his sister , he at least thinks she is . 
  wait , ** voldemort is running for office **, 
  are you thinking what i 'm thinking b1 ? 
  i think i am b2 . 
  does your browser not have a built-in spellchecker ? 
  mine 's had it for so long i just assumed it was a standard feature these days ... 
  i get what you mean , but personally i find the ithilien ranger itch is scratched * perfectly * by multiclassing rogue and fighter . 
  maybe one level of this new ranger for the favoured enemy . 
  dude do n't feed the trolls . 
  just downvote and move on . 
  responding to them is just giving them exactly what they want . 
  v_maet , in this case . 
  they consistently spout nonsense and when faced with evidence to the contrary doubles down on the nonsense . 
  if they 're not a troll , they 're at best not worth conversing with as an irrational moron .
