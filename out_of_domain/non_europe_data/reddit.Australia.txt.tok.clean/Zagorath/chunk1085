  hahaha . 
  in all honesty , as far as australia is concerned , both est ( utc +10 ) and edt ( utc +11 ) are relevant at this time of year . 
  gods why does google have such dull presenters . 
  this guy has such incredible material to work with but i 'm just bored by it ... google needs to get whoever trains apple 's presenters to train theirs . 
  i 'm guessing you 're somewhat ahead of me , because as of the time i loaded this page she had only just gone on , but i have to agree . 
  * so much * more charismatic than the other presenters . 
  yeah at the time i wrote that she had n't gone on yet . 
  she was just walking on as i hit submit . 
  she 's definitely way better than the other guys were . 
  i 've never had an enormous amount of luck with managing sibelius 's built in player , so i ca n't help a lot . 
  i assume you 've looked at the mixer ( keyboard shortcut `` m '' to bring it up ) and made sure nothing 's set to `` solo '' or `` mute '' , and everything has the sliders up high enough ? 
  you should remove the ` < div class = ` wide '  ` clause at the top there , it makes it look * really * weird . 
  add some flavour text in to the top if you 're concerned about how little of the second column is being used . 
  each of the subraces would also benefit from more than a single sentence describing their flavour . 
  a picture would go nicely , too . 
   and you have disadvantage on stealth and all dexterity checks, 
  i think you should clarify . 
  does this mean `` all dexterity * ability * checks '' , or `` all dexterity attack rolls , ability checks , and saving throws '' ? 
  or maybe it 's only ability checks and saving throws ? 
  additionally , i 'm concerned that an ac of 18 at level 1 is a bit too much . 
  maybe 17 would be better ? 
  add on a shield and the defense fighting style and they can * still * reach 20 with that , which is pretty damn high for a level 1 character . 
  i feel like hooli is exactly what real life apple would be if they took their culture but focussed on the same areas that real life google focusses on . 
  wow that was * incredibly * abrupt . 
  yeah it 's a total rort . 
  even after you convert from usd to aud , and if you assume they 're paying tax on it ( and to be honest i 'm not sure if they are ) , it equates to $ 940 . 
  tap on an extra $ 20 ( as an upper bound ) for international shipping , and we 're * still * being ripped off by over $ 100 . 
  $ 1079 , not 49 . 
  but yeah , it 's a total rort .

  i would say make it 17 , but say that it counts as wearing armour for the purposes of features such as the defence fighting style . 
  a character should not be able to have an ac of 18 at level 1 while style having every other feature focussed on offence ( e.g. , two-handed weapon and an offensive fighting style ) . 
  full plate armour is something players wo n't normally get until level 7 or higher . 
  at the same time , someone buying this is n't necessarily * not * `` living within their means '' . 
  i 'm buying it , but i also buy phones at roughly half the rate most people do -- i 'm upgrading from an ailing nexus 4 . 
  minecraft , i suspect . 
  but wow , runescape was the game of my childhood . 
  always great to see references to it . 
  did anybody doubt this ?

  uhh , mate , try double checking this thread of comments . 
  the chain goes, 
  boxcarpenguin, 
  you, 
  but your comment would only make sense if omegax84 's second comment was a reply to * you * . 
  omega 's argument is the same one as yours , and they were responding to the person that you said you disagreed with . 
  and yet you reply to omega as if they thought they were disagreeing with you . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) but outside events and [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 54kha6/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  thanks . 
  unfortunately , no multiplication happened in this instance . 
  i see what you 're getting at , but overwatch was a new ip in a genre that is probably one of the * least * well represented on macos . 
  civ vi is the latest game in a franchise where nearly every desktop release has supported macs , from a company with a long standing partnership with aspyr . 
  in fact , [ of the games associated with the civ ip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilization_ ( series \\ ) ) , the only ones * not * on some form of mac release were the mobile and browser games , civilisation ii : test of time ( a remake/reskin of the basic civ ii , plus some new substantial expansions ) , and civcity : rome , which is more of a city-building black & white style game than a civ-like tbs . 
  apart from perhaps the sims , i ca n't think of * any * franchise i would be more surprised to see not supported on macos in a core game than civ . 
  pfft , bsd or bust . 
  this comment has been removed . 
  please remain civil . 
  i thought he might be that new guy oliver 's meant to recruit . 
  the guy with the funny mask . 
  but i also think he might end up being a secondary villain anyway . 
  but all previous nexi have come out around this time also , so it 's not an area where the pixel has an advantage . 
   galaxy s7/edge is one of the most popular and we 'll received phones for a reason . 
  that reason being exceptionally good marketing by samsung over the past few years , to the point that the average consumer thinks of phones as being apple vs. samsung , not ios vs. android . 
  samsung 's mind share is so huge ( for better or worse ) that any flagship phone they put out is pretty much guaranteed to be a massive success , regardless of quality . 
  either is fine . 
  hey sorry , but reddit does n't allow link shorteners . 
  could you please link directly to what the shortener points at . 
  ( to use brackets in a url , you need to escape them . 
  ` [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/page_ ( disambiguation \\ ) ) ` , for example , if you wanted to link to `` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/page_ ( disambiguation ) '' with the text `` here '' . ), 
   what i 'm getting at is that i do n't think this video is actually an `` adam ruins everything '' segment , but the `` adam '' character being used in a sponsored video about fasfa on behalf of collegehumor . 
   i suspect the comments are disabled , not due to criticism , but at the request of fasfa and because it 's just a commercial , rather than a genuine piece of ch/are content . 
  both of these are correct . 
  it 's not a true adam ruins everything show , and it was n't really meant to be taken as such . 
  it 's like when you see a celebrity from a major tv/film series player their character from that series in an ad . 
  like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5kyddfq8z4 ) with quicksilver from the x-men films advertising v energy drink . 
  and ch * always * , or at the very least very regularly , blocks the comments and likes on sponsored videos they do . 
  it 's nothing nefarious . 
  the only bit that 's slightly sketch is perhaps the fact that they 're deleting comments in * other * threads that reference it . 
  but even that is n't necessarily all * that * bad . 
  they made a commercial deal , why would they want to jeopardise that in the name of allowing people on the internet to whine about it ? 
  to the op i would say , if you have evidence that the video itself contained misleading information , please do share it . 
  rather than just complaining and saying `` it 's wrong '' , say exactly what 's wrong about it , what the correct information is , and provide sources . 
  also , add some damn formatting to your post , nobody is going to take a massive wall of unformatted text seriously . 
  fwiw , i do n't particularly care one way or another how accurate it is . 
  i 'm not american , so an american university thing has no bearing on me . 
   in european clothing , fitchets , resembling modern day pockets , appeared in the 13th century . 
  vertical slits were cut in the super tunic , which did not have any side openings , to allow access to purse or keys slung from the girdle of the tunic . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pocket ), 
  since the `` tech level '' of the prototypical d&d world is roughly equivalent to medieval earth with touches of renaissance technology , it 's not unlikely that people would be familiar with pockets . 
  of course , it 's difficult to translate d&d precisely to a point in earth 's history on account of the whole magic thing , and the timings in this case even mean that the approximate tech level could be early enough that pockets had n't evolved . 
  so it can go either way . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd know how to change this to work with bash by any chance , would you ? 
  batman 's answer is correct ( of course it is -- it comes from the official source !, 
  ) , basically nothing other than main body * text * counts . 
  what 's important to note though is that 4,000 is the * upper * limit .
