   * laminar flow occurs at low reynolds numbers , where viscous forces are dominant , and is characterized by smooth , constant fluid motion ;, 
   * turbulent flow occurs at high reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces , which tend to produce chaotic eddies , vortices and other flow instabilities . 
  but i got no idea what that means in this context . 
  just stealing from wikipedia . 
  interesting , but would a trebuchet normally be firing spherical objects ? 
  i always had the impression they just got whatever big rocks they could and threw those . 
  i 'd assume the re would be quite a bit higher than for a spherical cannonball . 
  personally i do n't think the zendikar stuff belongs here . 
  it 's not made by the d&d team at wizards , it 's homebrew that just happens to be made by people who work for the same company that makes d&d . 
  but i would also ask , why is the rune scribe listed as `` incomplete '' ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's not ( imo ) very * interesting * , but it certainly is `` complete '' inasmuch as any ua release is complete . 
  for reference , that $ 1 in 1942 would be equivalent to $ 14.78 today , calculated using cpi . 
  still a very cheap concert by today 's standards !, 
  haha fair enough . 
  but looking at the photo , it * seems * as though it 's saying the cheapest tickets available for some other concert were in fact $ 1.00 ( plus 10 % tax -- i guess that `` not including tax in the price '' bullshit has been around in the us for a long time ) , so by coincidence the calculation above still applies , just for a different concert . 
  ( though it seems not unreasonable to assume the prices would be in a similar range for this concert . ), 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  so , i marked this as `` class '' , but i really was n't 100 % sure that 's the right option . 
  it only goes 10 levels , when classes should really go for the full 20 . 
  this might work better as a prestige class . 
  getting the standard asis later than 4th and 8th level is * highly * unusual , and i would recommend strongly against it . 
  maximum power level obviously is n't a spell casting thing , but it does seem like a vaguely similar concept , so it * might * be worth considering having mpl equivalent to highest spell slot for a half caster . 
  the formatting/presentation of the psychic warrior powers is * seriously * lacking . 
  i would recommend taking a look at the battlemaster fighter manoeuvres in the phb and copying that style of formatting . 
  the class does n't explain anything about the warrior powers . 
  again , like the battlemaster 's manoeuvres , it needs an entry explaining how you choose them . 
  the class table is only a shorthand reminder : the body of the text needs to explain exactly what 's going on . 
  can you swap one out each time you level up ? 
  are you stuck with the ones you choose ? 
  how do you * use * these abilities ? 
  as an action ? 
  for free ? 
  how * often * can you use them ? 
  what do power points have to do with anything ? 
  i ca n't see any way to spend them . 
  why is there an asterisk next to them ? 
  again , these need an entry in the main body text , including words to the effect of `` your power points reset on a long rest '' . 
  ( saying `` per day '' is very much not good design . ), 
  biofeedback is one power that stands out immediately as badly designed . 
  what does `` dr 2 / - '' mean ? 
  from my exposure to other games ( namely m&m ) i 'm guessing dr means damage reduction , but as far as i 'm aware the term has no meaning in d&d , and the 2 / - bit is * especially * strange . 
  it makes no sense . 
  i have n't read through all of the abilities , but i 'm worried that many others will have similar problems with not actually making sense . 
  intuitive attack seems like an overly powerful ability to me . 
  it massively decreases the amount of abilities the character would need to focus on . 
  being too mad is a bad thing , of course , but not being mad enough is a problem as well . 
  imagine if the paladin could use charisma in its attacks -- it would be unstoppable since it could concentrate more on its con ( for hp and concentration ) and cha ( for number of spells prepared and the power of some of them , as well as for its attacks ) . 
  over all i think this is a bit of a mess . 
  it 's hard to figure out how you would actually play it , because so much is left unexplained . 
  i have n't even * looked * at the martial traditions yet . 
   you may use one attack to ... 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you mean by this . 
  however , if you mean `` when you take the attack action on your turn , you may forgo one of your attacks in order to ... '' , you should probably say it in those terms . 
  if you mean something else , it needs * serious * clarification . 
  it also feels like quite a powerful ability for a 3rd level one . 
  both resistance against all magical damage * and * advantage against all magical effects ? 
  wow . 
  i really like nullify magic . 
  it gets * counterspell * a few levels before an eldritch knight could , but long after a full caster would have access to it and slightly after a half caster would have access . 
  this feels like a really nice balance for a class specifically designed around protecting against magic . 
  countercharge feels like it should require something more from the user . 
  maybe it costs you your reaction ? 
  being unlimited is also a problem . 
  once per short rest could fix that , i feel . 
  depending on which mobile app you 're using , there should be a way to do it . 
  otherwise , including something like [ class ] in the title will flair it appropriately . 
  this should work on most subreddits , but will definitely work on / r/unearthedarcana . 
   someone tries finger of death and you just casually go `` no i 'm not , you are '', 
  well , more like `` sure okay , but you are too '', 
  they have as many as they need to get the job done . 
  most that i 've seen have been between 5 and 10 levels , inclusive . 
  [ the very best example ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) is exactly 5 levels . 
  you 've fixed page 9 , but page 2 is still off in the third column . 
  i 'd probably put a little `` prestige classes '' section just under `` classes '' . 
   fake bruce just pulled a trump . 
  you mean a penguin ? 
   easy there , beowulf, 
  wait , i thought we were discussing maths , not literature !, 
   also , why do we argue about who 's better , dctv supes or dceu supes ? 
  for me it 's not so much about drawing the comparison as it is that the dccu is just * bad * . 
  it 's spearheaded by a guy who absolutely hates the source material ( and has * said as much * ) , and it shows . 
  the comparison really is n't necessary , because hoechlin 's superman was almost * guaranteed * to be better , even if he acted terribly , just based on the integrity of the universe he was placed in . 
  it 's a moot point . 
  which nod are you referring to ? 
  i 'm not the guy you replied to above , and personally they 're 0 for 3 from me . 
  maybe 0.5 / 3 . 
  to me ( and most people i 've talked to ) , by far the least terrible of the dccu has been suicide squad . 
  you know , i was really expecting to hate this new joker , but i was really pleasantly surprised by the performance . 
  i still have the edgy tattoos and makeup/costume , and i 'm not a fan of him seeming to be genuinely in love with harley , but i thought the actor did a pretty good job with what he was given . 
   i feel like dceu is just very mediocre with horrible moments strewn in, 
  to be honest my opinion is the reverse . 
  i feel it 's a fundamentally deeply flawed franchise with a few somewhat redeeming moments . 
  wait , what ?
