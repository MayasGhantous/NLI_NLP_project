  but yeah , from the sounds of it they could have done the elven thing way better . 
  i must have misunderstood the wiki article but to me it sounded like they * did * have it as just a shift in language , which would have made way more sense than being like `` yeah , these guys were always special , do n't ask questions '' . 
   would lead to slower deployment of their universe, 
  that would have been a * much * better idea . 
  it felt to me , even before bvs came out , that dc seemed like they were scrambling to catch up to marvel and get to the big team-up movies asap . 
  after seeing it , i wish even more that they had just taken their time with it to build up the universe just like marvel did . 
  could you imagine if , right after the success of iron man 1 , they had gone straight into the avengers ? 
  it would have flopped !, 
  granted , dc 's big characters are much more well-known than marvel 's , and dc also has the advantage of an entire culture that is far more accepting of comic book movies than in 2008 , but as you say , it would have been so much more meaningful to us as viewers if we had some context for the big team up events . 
   i love that [ alfred ] is bad-ass and not just a butler, 
  he 's a bad-arse in gotham too . 
  and even in the dcau , there 's at least one episode that shows he had a pretty bad-arse backstory , even if for the most part today he 's just the butler . 
  i think the biggest thing that annoyed me about this alfred might have been that he seemed to be taking on some of the jobs that i thought lucius fox has taken in other iterations . 
   but that dry wit and humor was fun and i like it, 
  yeah got ta say , i loved that aspect . 
   looked fucking bad-ass though, 
  see , not to me it did n't . 
  i would have been laughing at it were i not internally groaning at how dumb it looked . 
  a scene like that might 've been cool for superman ( and gods know , snyder * loves * his jesus imagery with supes ) , because at least it would 've been * feasible * , but showing something like that as a metaphor * on screen * needs some way of also explaining why we the audience are seeing something literally happen that does n't make sense . 
  snyder really knows how to do metaphor well ( i happen to be quite a fan of sucker punch -- though i know not many people liked it -- largely because of that ) , but in this case i do n't think it worked because it had no literal explanation . 
   however , i did n't want that . 
  i wanted a movie that made sense , had a good story, 
  hear , hear . 
   they are best friends and i was n't a fan of them fighting right from the start . 
  to be honest i do n't necessarily mind it , if it 's the first time they meet ( as it was in this case ) . 
  they 're two such contrasting characters , it makes a lot of sense to me that , before they get to know one another , they 'd clash a little . 
  the dcau 's `` world 's finest '' portrays something like that . 
  they do n't outright * fight * , but they clearly do n't get along at first . 
  it does n't seem too much of a stretch to imagine that darker versions of both the characters would end up outright fighting . 
  and they did end up on pretty good terms at the end of bvs , too -- even if for dumb reasons . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  thanks . 
  and he was such an ** incredible ** superman , too !, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  it does n't look to me as though that 's what they 've done . 
  it looks like a completely different class that just happens to have the same name and the same general theme . 
  why ? 
  no , why would you submit a link to a reddit page on the same subreddit which was posted only minutes before . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because of the image host you linked to . 
  meme.am is actually a banned site on reddit . 
  could you please re-upload the image to another image host such as imgur and then let us know so we can approve the comment and allow others to see it ? 
  thanks . 
  what 's the automod rule for that ? 
  because they are an archetype that gets casting , they should probably not be getting 4th level spell slots until level 19 . 
  and their number of spell slots should not be exceeding that of the warlock when the warlock is a full short rest caster and this is only a 1/3 short rest caster . 
  basically , look at the eldritch knight 's maximum spell slots : this needs to match that . 
  and since the warlock gets so few spells , this should probably cap out at 2 per short rest if we 're being * generous * . 
  i 'd probably say it should get 1 per short rest up until level 17 . 
  from 17 onward , 2 spell slots . 
  without fixing those , it 's not really even worth looking at the other abilities , but from a quick glance they seem massively overpowered . 
  not so much a theory as just a joke . 
  but even so , when criticising an entire group of people for not being able to do something , it 's best if you can demonstrate that you yourself are capable of doing that thing . 
  otherwise you come across as a hypocrite . 
   someone on reddit said that 25 % of any given population has an iq of between 70 and 80 . 
  that explains things . 
  nope . 
  iq is * defined * as a normal distribution with \u00b5 = 100 and \u03c3 = 15 . 
  the p ( 70 < iq < 80 ) is less than 0.07 . 
  indeed , p ( iq < 80 ) is still less than 0.10 . 
  raw scores on iq tests are also rising , so if you placed the results of people today on the same curve as people three decades ago , you 'd find people are on average over 10 points ` smarter ' than they were back then . 
  that 's all aside from the fact that iq tests measure only a limited subset of intelligence, 
  stuff felicity , * thea * was crazy hot tonight . 
  luke cage is his actual name though , in the show at least . 
  he 's used it for * every * purpose since his escape from gaol . 
  damn , short notice . 
  did you ? 
  luke cage is n't a codename or something like that . 
  it 's literally the * identity * he assumes once he leaves gaol . 
  and yes , it does make it his real name . 
  it 's not necessarily his `` real '' name , but it 's his real name just as much as someone legally called `` jonathan '' who chooses to go by `` john '' has the `` real name '' of `` john '' . 
  the conversation is not about the law though . 
  there 's more to a name than what it says on your passport . 
  is it theoretically possible ? 
  sure . 
  in the forgotten realms , no such thing exists in established lore . 
  that 's not to say you * could n't * do it yourself , but i would be very careful in doing so . 
  if you 're interested in the subject matter , i would * highly * recommend the brimstone angels series by erin m. evans . 
  one of its major characters ( arguably the deuteragonist ) is a cambion -- a half devil -- who ( spoiler alert ) was raised entirely as a devil , but later on starts experiencing very much un-devilish feelings . 
  it 's an interesting dynamic because it establishes that according to canon it would be literally * impossible * for a full devil to turn good , but a cambion is someone who naturally will tend to be full on infernal evil , but maybe , just * maybe * could be redeemed . 
  but that 's just the existing canon , and only for the forgotten realms . 
  you are completely free to do whatever you want , * especially * ( but not only ) if you 're playing in a homebrew setting . 
  [ lots of stuff out there ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3areddit.com%2fr%2funearthedarcana+dark+souls&amp;oq=site%3areddit.com%2fr%2funearthedarcana+dark+souls&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4799j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) . 
  i do n't know where this perception comes from , but it 's a weirdly common one . 
  samsung is * huge * -- a much bigger percentage of the korean economy than any us company is in america -- but it 's not like it 's 80 % of the korean economy or something . 
  hyeondae and lg are almost equally as massive , and a few other ` smaller ' chaebols like lotte and sk are also extremely prominent . 
  your initiative * score * decreases down to -5 ? 
  ouch that is * harsh * . 
  are you sure you did n't mean that your initiative * bonus * decreases down to -5 ? 
  got some evidence for this ? 
  what 's being removed ? 
  you can still link to removed submissions . 
  they just ca n't be found in the subreddit feed . 
  i 'm not leaving this subreddit because some rando is telling me there 's rampant censorship , especially not if said rando refuses to provide evidence . 
  the alert feat gives a +5 * permanent * bonus to initiative , * and * gives you more stuff on top of that . 
  so perhaps going from +10 to -- 5 would be reasonable , and maybe a minor non-combat feature on top of that . 
   does anyone know if there 's any * cannon * sources to corroborate this ? 
  i 'm going to assume that typo was deliberate , given the context . 
  but it does make me wonder , how effective would the best of * modern * weapons , of various varieties , be against either shields or unshielded starfleet ships . 
   you can either believe that or not , that is not the point .
