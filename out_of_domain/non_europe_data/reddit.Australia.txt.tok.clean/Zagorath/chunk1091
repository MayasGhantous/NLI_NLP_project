  or just did the choral from holst 's jupiter ( which i did once , and it was * awful * ) . 
  or just played the first four notes of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  it * can * be fun occasionally , especially if it 's really well orchestrated ( which , for example video games live orchestrations generally are ) . 
  but it 's not nearly as fulfilling an experience . 
  a video game or video game series * could * theoretically come along and do some of the same things that , for example , john williams did with star wars , or howard shore did for lord of the rings , and compose the videogame in an almost operatic manner with leitmotifs and developing themes , and that would make it much more interesting to play . 
  but i 'm not sure how practicable it would be to compose such a score in a video game setting , and i 'm not aware of any that have really attempted that . 
  hi sorry , but reddit does n't like link shorteners . 
  could you please edit this to include a direct link to what you are trying to link to and then let us know . 
  also note that for the link to be clickable , it needs to include the `` https : / / '' at the beginning . 
  as far as i can tell , he did indeed edit it . 
  it 's really disappointing to me that apple has made getting discrete graphics card on a laptop so incredibly expensive . 
  i bought the last generation of non-retina 15 inch and honestly i 'm going to be hanging on to it as long as i can , because i just ca n't afford a discrete card these days . 
  dropping the non-retina macbook pro was a sad sign to me that apple is heading in a direction with their computers that i do n't think i want to follow . 
  a direction that 's going to lose them customers among those of us who want good specs for gaming , video editing , or other purposes . 
  since when ? 
  i do n't remember getting earphones with my nexus 4 . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 56rv1j/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 56rv1j/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  for me the biggest advantages of the earphones i bought compared to the sort that typically come in the box are a greater degree of sealing so i can hear stuff louder without needing to actually turn the volume up as much , and flat cables which mean they do n't get tangled up . 
  but you wo n't get that for $ 20 . 
  is the 5d a full frame or a 1.6 crop factor ? 
  anyway , it 's a nice enough photo , but kinda boring . 
  close ups of the moon are a dime a dozen . 
  what makes a really great photo of the full moon is what * else * is in the frame with it , be it a landscape , cityscape , stars , clouds , or whatever . 
  ( and , of course , composites can be useful here to get the right exposure on both the bright moon and darker surrounds . ), 
  particularly if it 's being shared on / r/brisbane , it seems like such a photo should really have something * of brisbane * , or the surrounding areas , in it . 
   the hl ( sl in brackets ) [ physics ] paper was regarded as being of appropriate difficulty by about 60 % ( 64 % ) of the respondents . 
  over 70 % of all respondents regarded this paper as being more difficult than last year 's paper . 
  both papers were regarded as having good , or better , ` clarity of wording ' by around 65 % of respondents ; and over 80 % or teachers judged the presentation to be good , or better . 
  an unexpected result after seeing the feedback on this subreddit following the exam . 
  if you have n't already , contact their mods . 
  they 've probably set up the automod somehow to remove posts that fail certain criteria that your submission has failed for some reason . 
  mine 's not so much truckin ' as running on fumes and stuttering , barely managing to keep going . 
  i loved that thing to bits , but i ca n't wait for my pixel to arrive . 
  only one i 've looked at is the shardmind , but it looks great . 
  my first self-made character was a shardmind , so i 'll always have a soft spot for them . 
  some minor errors with the text :, 
   they do n't need sleep , though they must still rest for six hours to gain the benefits of an extended rest . 
  this does n't mesh with the mechanics you 've put in . 
  also extended rest should be long rest in 5e . 
  there are a number of places where you 've put two words in without a space between them . 
  copy and paste your text into a word processor to do some spell checking to find them . 
  it desperately needs some artwork though . 
  and since it looks like you 're using the homebrewery , it would be beneficial if you were to share links to that . 
  it means people can easily produce slightly edited version ( most notably : print friendly ones ) if they need it . 
  also as part of homebrewery tips , you should use ** second level ** headings for individual races . 
  first level headings should only be used at the start of whole chapters , like the `` races '' chapter in the phb . 
  using / u/jwbjerk 's [ detect balance ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) guide ( but fixed to use the sam scale as musicus 's ) , i 'd rate it, 
  * crystalline mind : +0.5, 
  * living construct +1.5 ( which breaks down as :, 
  * * immune to poison : +2.0, 
  * * do n't need to breathe : +0.75, 
  * * half hit points when healed : -1.5, 
  * * do n't need to sleep : +0.25 ), 
  * immortal origin : +0.5, 
  * crystalline luminance : +0.25, 
  * languages : +0.25, 
  for a total of 7, 
  i kinda winged it with the value of telepathy , immortal origin , and crystalline luminance . 
  being able to talk to anyone could be really useful . 
  for most intents and purposes you essentially speak every language , though you ca n't read them . 
  immortal origin is discussed below . 
  crystalline luminance is probably mostly useful just to show off . 
  with its tiny 5 ft range , it 's probably more of a weakness when travelling in a dimly lit cavern than an advantage , since it would give away your position if you turned it on . 
  living construct is tough . 
  complete immunity to poison is * really * powerful , and immunity to the poisoned condition is somewhat useful , too . 
  not needing to breathe is rarely going to be worth much , but on the occasions that it is , it 's a damn good thing to have . 
  i ranked this bit lower than what jwbjerk does though , because it seems overrated in his scale to me ( he gives unending breath , which means you do n't need to breathe * while conscious * a value of 1 ) . 
  the half hitpoints thing is pretty tough , but i 'm not sure i can justify it offsetting immunity to poison and the poisoned condition , so i 've put it at only -1.5 . 
  in my experience , most healing tends to be using hit dice , any way . 
  as a side note , you count as an aberration . 
  that 's interesting . 
  considering you have living construct as an ability , it would seem the more obvious type to have . 
  though then you would be immune to the effects of * cure wounds * and similar . 
  as far as i 'm aware , being an * aberration * is unlikely to affect play too much , except in certain spells like * detect evil & good * . 
  i 'm disappointed that there 's no shard swarm ability , because that was a really cool bit of unique flavour that shardminds had . 
  imo you could dump the poison immunity and add shard swarm back in as a long rest ability and both balance and flavour would be maintained . 
  but overall , i really like it . 
  it has the same really interesting and engaging flavour that the 4e version did , and the mechanics seem like they would work really nicely in 5e . 
  was the floor that dirty ? 
  and was there no bed ? 
  a small french village where nothing of note has happened since 1803 ? 
   and finally the fanbase sucks, 
  oh gods definitely . 
  i unsubscribed from that long before i unsubscribed from / r/arrow . 
  it 's just awful . 
  thoroughly enjoyed arrow this week . 
  i saw a lot of other people saying `` good , but not as good as ep . 
  i thought it was better to be honest . 
  the flashbacks felt similar to seasons 1 and 2 , where they were usefully related to the present day . 
  the main story was really interesting . 
  supergirl continues to go from strength to strength . 
  this guy is one of the best portrayals of superman * ever * in live action . 
  absolutely just * nails * what clark kent is supposed to be , and makes a damn fine man of steel to boot . 
  interested to find out more about this mysterious new kryptonian , too ( no future spoilers , please ) . 
  the flash is really beginning to frustrate me with its timey-wimey stuff . 
  if it is n't resolved satisfactorily i 'm gon na be so annoyed . 
  it 's currently doing pretty good things with it .
