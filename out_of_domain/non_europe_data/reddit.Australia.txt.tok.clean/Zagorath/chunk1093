  yellow rectangles . 
  i think they 're cheddar . 
  what ? 
  the new cheddars are so much better !, 
  the old ones were almost flavourless , but the new ones have this really strong delicious cheesey flavour !, 
  i do n't know how * anyone * has trusted them for a long time . 
  between [ being caught astroturfing ] ( http://fortune.com/2013/10/24/samsung-fined-340000-for-astroturfing-in-taiwan/ ) ( and accused of it many more times ) , [ flying journalists out to an event and then stranding them there after they refused to act as marketing shills ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/03/samsung-tech-bloggers ) despite [ previously having been explicitly told that they were going as independent journalists on behalf of samsung ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/03/samsung-tech-bloggers ) . 
  add to that another story of samsung going behind reporters ' backs ( this one affected a reviewer that i highly respect , but i ca n't link it because unfortunately he has since taken the video down ) , and now their absolutely scummy handling of the whole note 7 debacle , and i just can not believe how many people on here are willing to trust them . 
  i might be able to forgive them for any one of these types of mistakes if they own up to it and apologise . 
  but they repeatedly act in a way that shows utter disregard and lack of respect for their customers , journalists , and the wider public . 
  you do n't get to keep fucking up and keep apologising after each one , and still be forgiven for it . 
  it 's clearly a systematic `` do evil shit first , ask forgiveness if we get caught '' philosophy in the company . 
  pfft , i 'll bet you anything that this * was * the procrastination . 
  the question is , what was op procrastinating on in order to make this ? 
  no i 'm comparing the new rectangular ones to the old rectangular ones . 
  some rogue levels might also work . 
  i find sneak attack is an ability that feels very appropriate for a ranger-type character . 
  that 's actually really clever . 
  just with four lights lined up in a line , switching between torches , lanterns , and orbs gets you 81 different possible combinations ( 2222 in base 3 , plus 1 for 0000 ) . 
  that 's easily enough to do the whole alphabet ( case sensitive ) , plus numbers , and have a few left over dedicated for common words . 
  in fact , with just * three * of them , you could get the whole alphabet and a single special character ( probably space ) . 
  that means you have a whole spare light for toggling between whether you 're using letters or special words . 
  damn ... now i want to create a signalling system using this . 
  what dedicated words would you want ? 
  obviously the names of the characters in the party , as well as any known allies and enemies . 
  maybe commands like `` come here '' or `` retreat '' . 
  common actions like attack , defend , cast , shoot , etc. 
   you appear to be in a country where google domains is not yet available . 
  oh , well fuck you too google . 
  click `` flexible date '' or `` price graph '' on https://www.google.com/flights . 
  on price graphs , you enter a specific trip duration and it tells you when over the course of weeks or months the cheapest option is . 
  on flexible date , you enter rough start and end dates and it helps you see the cheapest precise dates near to those rough dates . 
  it 'll automatically pick up your closest major airport , but you may want to ensure that you 've also selected other nearby airports that you could conceivably fly out of or in to .

  does grey not know that it 's a well-known issue ? 
  it 's a plug-in that 's causing it . 
  not youtube 's problem . 
  the adjectival form of `` asmodeus '' is `` asmodean '' , with an a , not an o. 
  also , considering asmodeus is a god , it seems odd that you would be unable to become a cleric or paladin . 
  but as for balance , using / u/jwbjerk 's [ detect balance scale ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) ( with a dagger for things i am choosing to value differently to what the scale would , or a double dagger for things i am assigning a value to myself and have no predefined value ) :, 
  * banished from light ( radiant vulnerability ) : -0.5 ^ \u2020, 
  * banished from light ( vulnerable to allied detect evil & good type spells ) : -0.25, 
  * darkvision : +0.5 ^ \u2020 ( he just flat overrates it ), 
  * alluring charm : +3 ^ \u2021 ( at * least * . 
  much better than just getting * suggestion * , because it `` obeys your commands '' , while * suggestion * requires that the command be worded to make sense , and only allows a single command per casting . 
  it also does not require concentration , and damage only forces a save rather than automatically ending the effect . ), 
  * alluring charm ** variant ** : +3 ^ \u2021 ( being on a short rest increases its value a lot , but you lose all of the benefits the normal alluring charm grants ), 
  * wings : +1.75 ^ \u2021 ( value increased from 1.5 due to being allowed med armour ), 
  * languages : +0.25, 
  giving a total * base race * score of 7.25 , which is already at the very peak of the acceptable range . 
  * greater flight : +1.5 ^ \u2020 ( due to diminishing returns -- could arguably be worth as much as +2 ), 
  * asmodean fiend : -1.5 , +1.0 ^ \u2021 ( 1d4 + prof is better than 1d6 ), 
  * draining kiss : +1.5 ( based on dragonborn breath ), 
  the asmodean succubus is therefore worth a total of 11.75 . 
  that is ** vastly ** outside the acceptable range . 
  the graz ` zt sect :, 
  * grounded : -1.75, 
  * improved fiend 's guise : +1.0 ^ \u2021, 
  * ethereal breach : +2 ^ \u2021 ( i 'm * really * unsure about how much to value this , though ) . 
  the graz ` zt succubus is therefore worth a total of about 10.5 still totally unacceptable . 
  my recommendation would be to replace fiend 's guise and alluring charm with a standard spellcasting progression . 
  cantrip at level 1 , once per day 1st level spell at level 3 , once per day 2nd level spell at level 5 . 
  use * disguise self * and * suggestion * as the spells . 
  or maybe replace * disguise self * with * alter self * , but with the same restrictions on the chosen form that you gave fiend 's guise . 
  then remove the subclasses . 
  put a +2 asi in the base race ( along with the +1 ) . 
  i have n't run the maths on it , but that would hopefully put it closer to an acceptable range . 
  if it 's still too powerful , remove its flight and give it draining kiss . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because of the image host you linked to . 
  quickmeme is actually a banned site on reddit . 
  could you please re-upload the image to another image host such as imgur and then let us know so we can approve the comment and allow others to see it ? 
  thanks . 
  i could be wrong , but i * think * the sport being described in this thread is soccer , not league or union . 
  i do n't watch soccer in any form , but i think that if i did , i 'd probably prefer woman 's . 
  from what i 've heard , their games tend to be more dynamic , and they 're ( somewhat ironically ) much less prone to being complete pussies ( when it comes to things like exaggerating injuries and/or diving ) than the mens ' soccer players are . 
  the creator of that homebrew guide decided to change the scale to a less intuitive one . 
  his goal was to remove decimals , but to be honest it 's not a very good system . 
  it was originally compatible with the musicus system ( the one you linked ) , and i 'm using it in that way . 
  divide all his numbers by 4 to get the correct value . 
  edit : no idea what `` order of the stick homebrew compendium '' is . 
  you linked to the musicus homebrew guide . 
  / u/jwbjerk 's system was based off of that and was * mostly * compatible with it at first . 
  he decided to multiply all the values by 4 at some point , making it utterly unusable in its current form , which is why i use it divided by 4 back into the compatible range , but maintaining the greater precision that he developed . 
  one suggestion cast * per short rest * . 
  one per long rest is already worth exactly 1 , but being one of the most potent social skill i think once per short rest is easily worth three times that . 
  it can get you anything from free passage in to see the king , to getting a bad guy to fight on your side , to having the rich merchant give you all his gold . 
  at the * least * , it scales linearly , but i 'd almost be tempted to say it scales exponentially , since knowing you 'll be able to use it again fairly soon means you 'll be more inclined to use it more often . 
  i can see your argument for guise . 
  perhaps it would be reasonable to move it down from 1.5 to 0.75 . 
  certainly can not go less than that , though , because it is still giving you a perfect disguise . 
   the portion of people with wireless chargers is smaller than / r/android makes it seem, 
  damn , it must be ** tiny ** then . 
  because even in this sub that particular niche feature looks , well , really niche . 
  i always maintain that i would * prefer * a phone without a removable battery . 
  the mechanisms to allow the battery to be removed take up considerable space , and that means that the battery has to be smaller so all that stuff can fit in . 
  and that means battery life is worse . 
  if i can last on a single charge more often , that 's better . 
  if i 'm going long enough that i 'm going to need more than one charge , i can carry an external battery pack .
