  superman : the animated series follows it , and they have some crossovers in the later seasons of batman . 
  i really was n't a huge superman fan before watching this , but it really convinced me that superman can actually be an interesting character . 
  and then there is justice league and jl : unlimited , also fantastic . 
  the great thing with the dcau is that if you take the whole thing it 's going to be way over your 100 episode limit , but any individual show in it is completely watchable on its own and comfortably stays under that . 
  so you can get into one show if you want , and ignore the others , or you can try all of them out and see which you enjoy . 
  on another note , i agree with you that dreamworks dragons is not fantastic , but i will say that i think the way the character of viggo grimborn in seasons 4 and 5 ( if you count the first netflix season as season 3 ) is one of the best-handled villains i 've ever seen . 
  the way he is , at first , introduced solely through whispers and built up to be this great opponent . 
  then when we see him , he really delivers and becomes a fantastic intellectual threat to our protagonist . 
  it 's all really well done . 
  he 's just the * perfect * example of a reoccurring bbeg in a story with multiple threads . 
  question : how does the white lotus gambit work with these rules ? 
  does n't iroh place the lotus in the centre of the board at the start ? 
  i 've never actually played hl2 because i 've tried getting through hl1 and find it just so dull in terms of narrative , and damn-near unplayable in terms of mechanics . 
  age of empires . 
  it was probably the pc game i played the most as a kid , but today it 's just honestly quite terrible . 
  i do n't enjoy aoe ii any more either , but for some reason some people do . 
  to me , the only empires games that have stood the test of time are age of mythology and aoe iii . 
  i am definitely * very * interested in that . 
  when do we hear the name of the rose tile ? 
  and if it 's not a white lotus , then what significance does said lotus have in the first place ? 
  iroh goes a ** long ** way out of his way to get his hands on a white lotus tile in the waterbending scroll , so the tile itself must have some significance , must n't it ? 
  my biggest concern though is that this ruleset seems to imply that the only legal starting move is in one of these ` gates ' . 
  but iroh clearly places something ( whether it be called the rose or the white lotus ) in the centre right off the bat . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  my feelings towards the four games today mirror yours , though i originally played them in the same order that they came out ( though on a much-delayed time period ) and at the time i enjoyed each of them . 
  the sultan 's theme from scheherazade , or scheherazade 's theme , or something else ? 
  hi sorry , but reddit does not allow link shorteners . 
  could you please change those links to point directly at whatever they link to ? 
   australia has a rough , pioneering spirit like america , i 'd imagine - great landscapes full of dangerous animals, 
  the danger of australia 's animals is grossly exaggerated online . 
  but even to the extent that it 's true , the animals are not the sort that are easily dealt with by guns . 
  spiders , snakes , and swooping birds are much more of a threat here than wolves and bears . 
  guns , when owned today , are mostly used for dealing with pest animals like wild boars , rather than for protection . 
  but to understand how people think of guns today , it 's important to understand some history . 
  in 1996 , australia suffered the latest in a string of mass shootings , the port arthur massacre . 
  as a result , the recently elected liberal ( our * conservative * party , do n't let the name fool you ) prime minister john howard pushed through some very strong gun control laws . 
  at the time , these were massively controversial . 
  it really * can not * be overstated just how much pushback there was over this . 
  but the laws went through , and millions of people 's guns were bought back from their owners by the government , and destroyed . 
  guns were ** not ** , it 's important to note , banned . 
  the law was simply changed so that only certain classes of weapons were allowed , and only if the user had a legitimate reason to own them . 
  genuine reasons include sport shooting , recreational hunting , and needing to protect your crop/livestock as a farmer . 
  they do * not * include self defence . 
  handguns are available only to sport shooters , and various types of non-semi-automatic weapons are available to different subsets of the other genuine reasons . 
  pump action and semi-automatic rifles are only allowed with a magazine capacity of up to 5 or 10 shots , respectively ( except for law enforcement ) . 
  there are other rules such as permits and waiting periods . 
  and over time it became * readily * apparent that these laws worked . 
  a mass shooting is defined as a public event where four or more people are killed by guns . 
  we have n't had a single one of these since port arthur . 
  firearm related homicides and suicides are similarly virtually unheard of . 
  as the other commenters said , we now live in a state where the vast majority of australians will never even * think * about firearms , outside of maybe playing call of duty , or watching the news . 
  we live in what feels to the average person like an extremely safe country . 
  contrast this with america , where it seems like we 're hearing about a large-scale mass-shooting every month . 
  and that 's just the ones that we * hear * about : i would n't be surprised to learn that there are a lot more that never make the news just because they only * just * get over that 4 deaths limit . 
  clearly , with all due respect , you guys * need * to do something to fix this , because your current lax gun laws simply do not work . 
  australia 's laws are not some authoritarian nightmare . 
  they are very reasonable and people who have a good reason to own a gun can get one quite easily for that purpose . 
  unfortunately , conservatives in your country have decided that anything other than `` everyone can get any gun whenever they want '' is an unacceptable infringement on a person 's freedom , and it 's made it impossible for you guys to enact meaningful , sensible gun law reform like australia 's conservatives did two decades ago . 
  ( incidentally , i think this probably could * only * be done if pushed by conservatives , in either country . 
  it would be untenable for a progressive party to be seen doing it for political reasons . ), 
  hmm , perhaps . 
  i always thought of ` resource ' as being more things like photoshop brushes , or the homebrewery , as well as things like the detect balance scale . 
  tools to help creating and evaluating homebrew . 
  was that wrong ? 
   far , far better than the dc film efforts recently, 
  are you talking about the recent dc live action films , or their recent animated film universe ? 
   young justice ( the latter three are on netflix ), 
  not here they are n't :(, 
  but also , young justice is n't a part of the dcau . 
   star wars : clone wars, 
  do you mean this , or do you mean star wars : ** the ** clone wars ( emphasis mine ) . 
  the difference is important , because they 're actually two completely different shows . 
  of course it does n't happen chronologically . 
  people do n't all notice that they were wrong about the same thing at the same time . 
  berenstein makes sense as a human name , as the - stein suffix is a common one , so people simply assume that 's what the name is . 
  it 's only at some arbitrary point that they actually look closely and realise they were wrong about it this whole time . 
  it would n't make sense for everyone to have this revelation simultaneously . 
   this is also a common trope in science fiction , where a character will be unknowingly transported to an almost identical parallel universe , and will start to notice unsettling discrepancies in the world . 
  fucking barry allen messing with the timeline again . 
  honestly i saw / r/mandelaeffect trending and thought it could be a cool place discussing why exactly people misremember things . 
  but nope , most of the people in there think that the explanation for the mandela effect is n't something rational like ` most of him was gold so you subconsciously just assumed his leg was too ' or ' - stein is a common name suffix so you assumed that was how it was spelt ' , it 's ` omg lik , time travel or multiple dimensions and shit ' . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  could have been an interesting subreddit . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  i have to say , predicting that a particular version will be the * second * last one is quite impressive . 
  i usually ca n't know how close something is to being done until i feel comfortable guessing that something is probably the last version . 
  but anyway , you 've got some text on the first page that 's bleeding into the third column and is thus unreadable . 
  these would probably benefit from some more flavour text about each patron , or at least a general one about genie patrons in general . 
  if these are meant to be warlock patrons , they should be getting :, 
  * a main flavourful defining feature at level 1, 
  * a mostly skill-based or defensive ability at level 6, 
  * a resistance at level ** 10 ** ( not 11 ), 
  * a powerful defining feature at level 14 . 
  your level 6 abilities for the efreet and marid break this rule , and * all * of your level 10 abilities ( if you were to move them from 11 back to 10 ) do as well . 
  i approved their comment , which is why you can see it . 
  but any comments they make are automatically put in the spam filter . 
  i typically want to see people at level 3 after at most 3 or 4 sessions , and i try to level up once every 2-6 sessions after that .
