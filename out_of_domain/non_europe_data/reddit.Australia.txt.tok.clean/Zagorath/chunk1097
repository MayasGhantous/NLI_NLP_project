   obviously i believe in that there was a change . 
  yeah , i made that last comment before i realised how insane many people on this subreddit are . 
  i thought it was for , you know , actually discussing the reasons so many people misremember things . 
  or for a complete direct link :, 
  the same as whatever type of armour it 's based on . 
  adamantine plate is ac 18 , adamantine chain shirts are 13 + min ( 2 , dex ) . 
  so , this sort of thing should not be a surprise to anyone . 
  samsung is a ** really ** scummy company . 
  they 've [ been caught and fined for astroturfing ] ( http://fortune.com/2013/10/24/samsung-fined-340000-for-astroturfing-in-taiwan/ ) before , and accused of it many more times . 
  remember how angry reddit got at unidan for gaining popularity through voting up his own submissions and downvoting others ? 
  samsung does exactly the same shit , except it 's not limited to reddit . 
  do n't trust * anyone * you hear giving positive feedback about samsung products online because there 's a good chance they 're being paid to do it . 
  they also have a history of doing * absolutely reprehensible * things to the press . 
  [ they flew some journalists out to another country to report on an event once ] ( http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/ ) . 
  said journalists agreed to participate in this after getting assurances that they 'd be there as independent reporters . 
  once they got there , [ samsung told them that they had to stay at the samsung booth and show off samsung products ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/03/samsung-tech-bloggers ) . 
  when the journalists refused , they were told samsung would cancel their hotel and return flights , leaving them stranded in a foreign country . 
  there 's another example where a reporter was not invited by samsung to an event , i think it was the announcement of one of the galaxy s or note phones , but the reporter then * did * get invited by a local telco to be their vip at the event , since samsung had given them enough invitations to give out to journalists and guests of their choosing . 
  samsung then went behind the backs of both the telco and this reporter and cancelled this reporter 's invitation to the event , leaving him waiting at home wondering where his ride was until he eventually managed to get a hold of someone at samsung 's pr who could explain what went on . 
  the answer : he occasionally swears on twitter . 
  unfortunately , he 's since taken down the video where he explains this , presumably to get back in samsung 's good graces , so i ca n't link to it . 
  and finally , they 've done just about * everything * they possibly could have wrong with these exploding note 7s . 
  they reacted too slowly , they rushed out the second wave of supposedly ` repaired ' phones clearly without having had enough time to properly diagnose and fix the problem , putting more people in danger . 
  and now they 're doing whatever they can to silence anyone from talking about the whole thing . 
  not many companies can truly be said to be capital g ` good ' , but a select few can definitely be said to be truly evil . 
  and samsung , or at least the division of it responsible for phones ( samsung being a chaebol with its tendrils in a wide variety of industries , each of which is run fairly independently of the others ) , really is up there . 
  nobody should be surprised when they do shit like this any more , and it really surprises me that they hold so much trust among so many people . 
  a human could get up to 20 at level 1 . 
  rolled three 6s , add +1 from racial bonus , and pick a feat that grants +1 . 
  you can see [ here ] ( http://anydice.com/program/f78 ) that in order to get the same probability as a crit on 1d20 , you 'd want to call a crit `` 16 or higher '' and a crit fail `` 5 or lower '' . 
  alternatively , you could say `` crits and crit fails become vastly less common '' . 
  with portents and with the lucky feat , i would substitute mentions of d20 with 3d6 . 
  instead of rolling d20s for their portents , they roll two * sets * of 3d6 and keep those totals in mind . 
  instead of rerolling a single d20 , they can reroll all 3d6 and choose either total . 
  but no mixing and matching between the two . 
  the harder ones to deal with are the halfling 's lucky and advantage . 
  i 'd probably say it 's the highest 3 of 5d6 , or the lowest 3 of 5d6 . 
  and with lucky i would probably say roll all 3d6 , then any of those that come up with 1 get rerolled . 
  but i do n't know how either of these affect the probability . 
  personally , i 'm more than happy just staying with 1d20 . 
  and your formatting was fine . 
  i was n't a big fan of season 4 in general . 
  i just did n't think kuvira was a particularly convincing villain , and i thought that while the * idea * of korra going through the trauma of recovering from her long-term physical and mental damage due to the mercury poisoning was a great one , it was n't actually very well handled in practice . 
  i just was n't as convinced by it as i would have hoped to have been . 
  i 'd probably agree with you were it not for that second story . 
  if flying people to a foreign country under false pretences and then threatening to leave them stranded there if they refuse to work for you is n't `` evil '' then i do n't know what is . 
  i believe it 's samsung . 
  [ this thread ] ( / r/android/comments / 58bz6b/samsung _ made_youtube_remove_video_of_gta_mod_that / ) in / r/android had a few people mentioning the streisand effect in relation to samsung 's fraudulent use of youtube 's takedown system in order to get videos parodying their exploding note 7 taken down . 
  [ here 's the r/streisandeffect thread on the topic ] ( / r/streisandeffect/comments / 58ebc3/samsung _ asks_youtube_to_take_down_gta_v_satire / ) , which is the subreddit 's top post of all time ( not that that says much , in a subreddit with 19 submissions ) . 
  this is exactly why , despite the fact that it comes with many of its own problems , i am a * staunch * supporter of australia 's compulsory voting laws . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you 've called it a c # chord , then it 's c # g # . 
  more conventionally , it 'd be db and ab . 
  but mixing the two in the same chord ? 
  but on a more serious note , i 'm curious , how do most people think it should be played ? 
  i dunno about that . 
  the points of difference you mentioned are certainly accurate , but to be honest i think you 've mostly * exhausted * that list . 
  we really are * very * similar cultures . 
  i grew up largely surrounded by brits ( at international schools in asia ) , and the cultural similarities between british and australians were noticeable , especially compared to americans or canadians . 
  we share a similar taste in humour ( this , i think , is a cultural similarity whose importance ** can not ** be overstated ) , a similar almost fanatical affinity for sport ( though our choices of league or afl differ quite a bit from their soccer ) , we tend to be a courteous people with respect to things like lines and non-aggressive driving ( i know australians might refute that latter point , but trust me , we really are * very * courteous in general on the roads compared to asians , and from what i 've read online americans as well ) , we share their taste for tea , and we generally do n't take ourselves very seriously . 
  to put it simply , if i asked you `` who does australia have the most cultural similarity with , apart from new zealand ? '', 
  the answer would be obvious . 
  you would n't even need to think about it . 
  sure we 're not * identical * , but i think you 're grossly exaggerating the differences . 
  $ python dndappfile_viewer . py, 
  file `` dndappfile_viewer . py '' , line 11, 
  def uprint ( * objects , sep = ' ' , end = ' \\ n ' , file = sys.stdout ) :, 
  syntaxerror : invalid syntax, 
  but more generally , this could * really * use some explanation for how to use it . 
  how exactly does this script find the files to use ? 
  what in the hells do the files actually represent ? 
  i notice it has ` fileloc ` . 
  is that meant to be changed to point to the location on disk at which i extracted a downloaded zip from github ? 
  if so , can it be a relative path ( ` ~ / directories/dndappfiles ` ) , or does it have to be absolute ( ` / home/my-user/directories / dndappfiles ` or ` / users/my-user/directories / dndappfiles ` ) ? 
  also , should this script work in python 2.7 ? 
  if not , could you make the changes necessary so that it does ? 
  that 's the version of python included already on most not-shit operating systems or is the default to download in most circumstances . 
  edit : i just tried running it in python 3 instead of python 2 . 
  when i use a relative path to the directory , i get the following :, 
  $ python3 dndappfile_viewer . py, 
  traceback ( most recent call last ) :, 
  file `` dndappfile_viewer . py '' , line 8 , in < module , 
  tree = et.parse ( fileloc ), 
  tree.parse ( source , parser ), 
  source = open ( source , `` rb '' ), 
  filenotfounderror : [ errno 2 ] no such file or directory : ' ~ / directories/dndappfiles ', 
  when i use an absolute path , i get this instead :, 
  $ python3 dndappfile_viewer . py, 
  traceback ( most recent call last ) :, 
  file `` dndappfile_viewer . py '' , line 8 , in < module , 
  tree = et.parse ( fileloc ), 
  tree.parse ( source , parser ), 
  source = open ( source , `` rb '' ), 
  isadirectoryerror : [ errno 21 ] is a directory : ' / home/my-user/directories / dndappfiles ', 
  at the * very * least , this code could use some error checking so that it returns a message my understandable by an audience that are n't programmers . 
  how is `` is a directory '' an error ? 
  should i be pointing this script at some specific file ? 
  if so , it * really * needs to tell me what file that is , because i am neither familiar with how this script works nor how the elementtree class in python works and is used in this script . 
  edit2 :, 
  okay , so i found out that you have to point it at only ** one ** of the xml files included .
