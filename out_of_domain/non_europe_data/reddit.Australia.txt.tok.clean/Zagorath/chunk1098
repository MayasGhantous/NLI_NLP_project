  that , imo , should be fixed to allow a hierarchy of multiple files . 
  even better would be if the first thing upon opening the application , the script prompted the user to * enter * a file/directory name to search . 
  so i could just enter ` . ` and have it search every directory recursively from the directory the script is located in for xml files , or alternatively i could enter ` items ` and it would only search items ( currently , magic , mundane , and valuable items , separately ) . 
  but in the meantime , it would , as i mentioned above , benefit from both more explanation on how to use it , and also a ** lot ** of error handling . 
  ** never ** assume a user is going to use your application correctly . 
  enter number of item or enter 0 to search again or x to see results again :, 
  at this stage , a note that hitting ` enter ' will return you to the keyword search mode would be helpful . 
  but if , on that ` enter number ' screen , the user enters something that is * not * a number ( as i did accidentally just now ) , it crashes . 
  ` int ( ) ` throws a ` valueerror ` if given a string that ca n't be coerced into an int . 
  some error handling to tell the user something along the lines of `` you have entered a value that is not a number , please enter a valid number or hit enter to return to search mode . '', 
  would be useful . 
  it was one of the earliest ones ( either the first or second ) , and to be honest it 's not very good . 
   reminds me of schools forcing people to build and pack ps4s for free or else they 'd lose course credits, 
  wait what ? 
  that 's literally what half of the comment threads on this post are about . 
  op left off the entire domain from their link . 
  wowza . 
  that 's a lot of explanation . 
  i feel like a comment this long about `` reddit 's formatting '' should probably have the term `` markdown '' mentioned somewhere . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  odd . 
  it should n't . 
  it does n't for me . 
  what are your dns settings ? 
  wow that * is * weird . 
  my firefox is doing it too , now that i try that . 
  so is safari . 
  only chrome seems not to of the browsers on my systems . 
  happens that way on both macos and linux . 
  i 've never even heard of honor phones before , so they ca n't be very good at it if that 's what they 're doing !, 
  but it would n't even make sense for people to have been astroturfing for nexus . 
  it was a brand produced by such a wide variety of manufacturers , including at one point samsung . 
  google was in general in charge of the whole thing , but not super intricately involved . 
  more recently , if you were to say * pixel * were astroturfing , that would definitely make more sense logically , as a venture that google is taking a very direct and public lead over . 
  personally though , the vast majority of comments i 've seen have been negative towards the pixel phones . 
  suspiciously so , in fact , and over such bizarrely nitpicky details that part of me wonders if at least some of this is n't fuelled at least in part by that same * negative * astroturfing . 
  the general attitude has turned more positive since the review embargo lifted and reviewers seem to be giving it largely positive feedback , but there are still a lot of comments loudly complaining . 
  not to mention , google is a company that engenders a * lot * of goodwill from a certain group of fans . 
  they 're a bit like apple in that way . 
  they have a lot of ` fanboys ' , if you will , who will say really good things about most things they do without anything more nefarious going on . 
  wow that 's ... just wow . 
  if you 're not careful , a well-placed * suggestion * can absolutely destroy virtually any non-combat encounter , and can even * significantly * aid in combat if used well . 
  they 're far from `` current generation '' , but in my opinion both ** age of mythology ** and ** age of empires 3 ** hold up * really * well with time . 
  both are available on steam , though my experience with aoe3 's multiplayer has been that you * need * to go through a third-party utility like gameranger or voobly : i 've never been able to connect to games with my friends over the game 's built-in multiplayer lobby . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/56rv1j/the_arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas/ ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/56rv1j/the_arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas/ ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  and the same also applies to weapons . 
  many ( but not all ) of them do n't specify exactly what type they should be , either letting it be any weapon at all or specifying something like ` any sword ' . 
  the mandela effect is about misremembering things . 
  that 's it , plain and simple . 
  any explanation about changing timelines or whatever is just insane . 
  i 'm sorry but it is . 
  there 's a lot of interesting discussion that could be had about * why * you remember things wrong , about what exactly about the way things actually are * lead * to that mistake , but talking about an explanation that makes less sense than santa claus completely removes that possibility . 
  out of curiosity , what do * you * think the mandela effect is ? 
  i 've been working on a mini-handbook for duelists . 
  my main inspiration for doing so was exactly your situation . 
  [ you can find it here ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/4kcj3fbal ) , and in particular , the third page is where the stuff about rapier and dagger is . 
  the handbook is n't entirely finished and ready to share yet , but the bit about mains-gauches is . 
  the idea was that to be effective with a main-gauche , you need currently to take a feat . 
  but if you 've taken a feat , the main-gauche becomes an inferior option to the frankly laughable notion of carrying two rapiers . 
  so i wanted to make main-gauche viable both with and without the cost of a feat . 
  without a feat , the main-gauche acts as a normal dagger except that it can not be thrown , and that it is able to be used with two-weapon fighting . 
  with a feat cost , you get a +2 bonus to ac against melee attacks and you get the same drawing and stowing benefits and the dual wielder feat . 
  the problem is that with that feat , rapier and dagger is a strictly inferior option to two rapiers , which does n't fit with the flavour . 
  the ideal solution is to make an alternative feat . 
  one that 's balanced compared to the ability to have two rapiers , but makes rapier and dagger a viable solution . 
  my solution to that has been a feat that does the following :, 
  * you gain a +2 bonus to ac against melee attacks while wielding a main-gauche in one hand and a finesse weapon in the other . 
  * you can draw or stow a main-gauche and another finesse weapon when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one . 
  along with the creation of the main-gauche weapon , which is basically a dagger without the thrown property , and with the special property that it can be used in two-weapon fighting if the other weapon is finesse . 
  1d8 +1 d4 is , as op says basically equivalent to 2d6 , so it should work just fine in terms of balance * without * the feat compared to not taking any feat . 
  the +2 ac bonus against melee attacks feels fairly well balanced against the +1 ac against * all * attacks * and * the ability to do 2d8 ( rather than capping at 2d6 ) with the existing feat . 
  maybe somewhat underpowered , but probably not too much . 
  so , up until coming across this subreddit when it trended yesterday , my * only * understanding of what the mandela effect was , was simply that it 's a lot of people misremembering things . 
  because , frankly , that 's all it * can * be ; the idea of everything in the world somehow magically changing makes no sense . 
  i 'm not entirely sure i understand your theory ; whether it is essentially a vaguely worded way of describing that fact , or whether it 's something that involves the same sort of weird magic that your collocutor is describing , only without this ` residue ' thing . 
   i 'm not sure which i 'd prefer , to be honest . 
  that , to me , is the sign of good mechanical homebrew , so i 'm really glad to hear you say that . 
  it means that someone can choose the one they like purely based on the one that better fits the flavour in their mind , rather than needing to sacrifice flavour for mechanics or vice versa . 
  it 's a complete coincidence , too , since i was trying specifically to balance it against dual wielder , and never really looked at any other feats . 
   these games are fantastic, 
  are they , though ? 
  honestly i really enjoyed playing them as a kid purely because it 's a lord of the rings rts , but if i were to try and objectively analyse the game , i 'd say they 're pretty terrible as rts games . 
  the economy system is one of the worst i 've seen in any rts . 
  it 's almost like they 'd rather it were a rtt with rts-like base building , but wanted * some * level of economic management in there and could n't be bothered putting in much more detailed combat strategy mechanics . 
  bannerlord is n't out yet . 
  it has n't even had a release date announced . 
  as much as i absolutely love mount & blade , comparing it to an rts is a little absurd . 
  on the combat map there is zero resource management , zero unit building , and only very limited more general strategic control over your units . 
  on the global map , there 's zero combat , zero strategic control of units , no * real * building , and quite a different style of resource gathering to what an rts would have . 
  they are both absolutely * fantastic * games , but they 're two * completely * different and unrelated genres with only some small amount of * very * superficial overlap . 
   please do n't recommend other star trek series , i 've tried getting into them , and never found the hook . 
  damn , that 's worrying . 
  i absolutely love tng for the same reasons you described , but i only did a full watch through after it got added to netflix a couple of months ago . 
  i 've been planning to start watching some of the other trek shows for the first time . 
  so it 's kinda sad to hear that they might not have that same awesome philosophy tng has . 
  it was youtube videos of those mods . 
  hi , thanks for your submission .
