  second , because of how extremely terrible one option is , a lot of people are far more passionate about making sure that does n't come to pass , and so more people are likely to want to post about it , leading to a higher portion of posts being about politics rather than other news . 
  i do n't agree at all . 
  the only reason two longswords makes sense to you is because it 's been a popular trope in fantasy media : you 're familiar with characters like ser arthur dayne dual wielding longswords . 
  in reality it 's a pretty absurd notion that only very rarely occurred . 
  just as absurd as two rapiers , tridents , or quarterstaves . 
  and to preemptively counter the obvious rebuttal , most fantasy takes place in a medieval knightly setting , where longswords are the type of weapon that 's popular in general . 
  you do n't see very much fantasy with even a single rapier , or a quarterstaff used as a primary weapon . 
  but more to the point , i can not possibly see why you would consider banning a player from doing that . 
  it 's * very * clearly meant to be within both the letter and spirit of the rules . 
  better than haydn 's imo . 
  both are equally awful , but at least beethoven is obvious about it . 
  he really just does n't care . 
  haydn 's is almost like `` i want to , but i just ca n't . '', 
  [ sleep cycle alarm clock ] ( https://www.sleepcycle.com/ ) does the same thing , but instead of assuming your cycles are ` about 90 minutes ' , it uses the phone 's accelerometer to work out what phase you 're in precisely .

   avocados are being promoted as an aspirational food . 
  if it 's still available on iview , one of the more recent episodes of gruen talked about this . 
  it was quite interesting . 
  probably the last or penultimate episode of this year 's season . 
  maybe third last in the worst case . 
  apparently the second season will be co-produced by netflix , so it will in fact be a netflix original series . 
  huh ? 
  of course it is . 
  both under the old definition ( where 1st world is us and allies , 2nd is ussr and allies , and 3rd is everyone else ) and under the more modern definition ( where it is synonymous with ` developing country ' ) . 
  i just want to point out that you should n't be using apostrophes to pluralise a word . 
  one viola , many violas . 
  one cello , many cellos ( or ` celli ' is also often heard ) . 
  one bass , many basses . 
  i would n't normally bother with the correction , but you made the mistake repeatedly and on literally every instance of these words , so i figured it would help . 
  edit : okay not quite literally every instance . 
  once in the op and once in one of the comments you used `` violas '' . 
  is the violist philosophically opposed to the first interpretation or something ? 
  i lean towards preferring option 2 , but option 1 is fine as well . 
  option 3 is too much imo . 
  i say this as a huge beethoven fan , but someone not particularly familiar with this piece in particular . 
  so take that as you will . 
  it 's shitty moderating because they should n't be removing non-spam submissions without providing a reason . 
  yeah it 's a bit weird . 
  they even call it a netflix original when they 've got nothing to do with it except that they bought the rights to show it in a particular country as it 's first airing in its home country . 
  shadow hunters , for example , is listed as a netflix original series , and i suspect that star trek : discovery will be when it comes out . 
   using two cutting swords of decent length was actually a thing that happened, 
  if by `` a thing that happened '' , you mean `` it did n't literally never happen at all '' , then you would be correct . 
  but it 's rare enough , especially in europe , that no reasonable person would come out saying that it 's a normal thing to do . 
  [ have a look at this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jznzyhnfsae ) , from one of youtube 's prominent sword experts . 
  and note that this video was one of the most * pro-dual-wielding * that i could find . 
  videos from lindy and skallagrim tended to be more negative . 
  note also that the idea is that his depiction of it in this video is pretty much exclusively about showing off . 
  [ here 's another video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1r-xzy-gb4 ) that describes dual wielding . 
  in this video he describes it as basically an option to aid in * defence * against multiple opponents -- and that 's something where two rapiers would certainly be just as effective at as two arming swords . 
  you ca n't attack with multiple weapons at a time , so using the second one to parry opens up some nice flexibility . 
   i do n't it that as [ sic ] within the spirit of the rules at all . 
  to be blunt , too bad . 
  you are wrong in this . 
  the rules for two-weapon fighting are very clear . 
  if there were any reason they did n't want two rapiers to work , it would have been worded differently . 
   it sounds as dumb to me as when players ask if they can use two shields . 
  shields have a specific rule saying you can only benefit from 1 , so that 's a complete non-sequitur . 
  frankly , d&d 's combat is not very realistic . 
  it never has been and it does n't try to be . 
  a lot about the game is n't . 
  a person can consistently ( over 96 % of the time ) survive a fall from 30 metres just because they * slightly * above average in constitution and have 6 levels in rogue ( edit : in real life , [ you are almost certain not to survive over 12 metres ] ( http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8106/how-far-would-you-need-to-fall-for-it-to-be-fatal ) ) . 
  how does that make sense ? 
  ( and of course , you know , * magic * , but i usually prefer not to bring that in to discussions of realism and logic because it 's part of the conceit of a fantasy setting . ), 
  it would be a really terrible dm that would tell a player they 're not allowed to use two rapiers . 
  i agree , this would be really damn useful . 
  working out what spells to take is hard enough as it is without needing to be constantly flipping back and forth between two different sections of the book . 
  it 's one of the many situations in the phb and other 5e books require you to move back and forth through the book to find the rules associated with a single idea . 
  another one is how infuriatingly often the index says `` see this other bit in the index '' , when it would have been * just as easy * to tell you where the thing you were looking for is located . 
  but fwiw , [ they 've already designed symbols for each class ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bbs5yw3.png ) . 
  if they did something like this , they 'd probably use those . 
  this is correct . 
  that said , youtube does also put claims on the scores themselves . 
  if you do a recording of your own of a clearly public domain piece like a mozart or beethoven , it 'll still get copyright claims from `` one or more music publishing rights collecting societies '' . 
  this happens quite literally every time . 
  thankfully , youtube usually removes the claim very quickly once you dispute it , but the fact that it 's there in the first place is insane . 
  one time , i had a claim on one of my videos from some shitty organisation called the harry fox agency . 
  the claim was for an entirely different piece by the same composer !, 
  in that case when i disputed it , they took a full 30 days ( the amount of time youtube gives them ) before they released the claim . 
   this route has restricted usage or includes private roads . 
  odd , i 've never seen that before . 
  which bit of the route is that referring to , do you know ? 
  who did it say was putting the claim on it ? 
  all of my recordings have had claims from the really ambiguous `` one or more music publishing rights collecting societies '' . 
  also , any chance for a link to the video ? 
  it 's such a lovely piece i would n't mind hearing a new version of it . 
  / u/the _ singular_anyone has also put out a rough draft of a second part to the stronghold building rules , [ traders and merchants , which can be found here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4y2jxb/wh _ strongholds_traders_merchants_finally_vendors / ) . 
  out of interest , have you seen les revenants ? 
  what 's it like ? 
  but from reviews i read of glitch back when i was watching it , while the premise is very similar , the tone of the two shows is quite different . 
  nah you 're completely right . 
  most recent aussie scripted tv i 've seen has felt rather lacking and cheap in its narrative . 
  like they 're afraid to take themselves too seriously , maybe ? 
  but we do have some * damn good * non fiction shows . 
  gruen and the checkout are both fantastic , and i know it catches a lot of flack , but q&a really is a show without equal in other western democracies . 
  hahaha . 
  not us per se . 
  we 've set automod to try and guess what you mean , so sometimes it will automatically flair for you , depending on how you worded your title . 
  anyway , my first thought is : should sparky sparky boom man really be a barbarian ? 
  my first thought would be to make him a monk .
