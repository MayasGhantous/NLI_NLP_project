  quite possibly a sun soul monk that does fire instead of radiant . 
   people are acting like they removed the primary or event secondary or tertiary use for a phone, 
  for me , it 's * at least * the secondary use for my phone , probably primary . 
  podcasts , audiobooks , and reddit combined make up probably 90 % of my phone usage . 
  2 of those 3 things require the headphone port . 
  bluetooth is not an option because it ( a ) uses more power on the phone , ( b ) requires charging the headphones far too frequently ( c ) requires more expensive headphones to have the same functionality , and ( d ) for some reason frequently cuts off the first word or two of every other sentence when listening to audiobooks . 
  that last one might have been specific to the bluetooth headphones i was using , but that was last year , so i do n't have high hopes that everything will work perfectly . 
  there 's also ( e ) makes switching from listening on my phone to my laptop to my desktop * insanely * difficult . 
  op 's comment from the / r/classicalmusic thread was amusing :, 
   chopin wrote no orchestral works worth mentioning . 
  and after 3 hours and significant numbers of downvotes :, 
  i upvoted just because it was hilarious . 
   https://github.com/copperdogma/dnd-phb-5e-index, 
  oh by the gods thank you !, 
  this is incredible !, 
  now if only their dmg index came in a formatted pdf like the phb one does . 
  you make it accurate as of when the phb was released . 
  then if you want , when you 're doing a new revision * anyway * ( as they do from time to time , to correct errors etc. 
  ) , also add in any new information necessary . 
  but considering the game has been out now for over 2 years and we still do n't have a single new class , i think it 's safe to say that it 's not really a huge concern anyway . 
  ( spells gained through a subclass or race are special cases which would not need to be indicated in this system . ), 
  hahaha . 
  i did n't notice that before . 
  no new classes . 
  those are n't classes ... 
   and when the press release is the source , like in one of your examples ? 
  yeah that one * really * bothered me . 
  who in the hells wants to read some boeing press release ? 
  let the editorial pick out the interesting parts of it and save us the effort . 
  edit : lol i 'm gon na leave that typo in . 
  not that i have anything against boeing , but i 'm sure their press releases are just as * boring * as i intended to convey . 
  ironically , it 'll only hasten the ban , as people become more irritated with the ads . 
   in the article, 
  there 's your mistake . 
  assuming people had read the article . 
  based on this video , i think grey intends to cut brady out of the equation entirely . 
  he had the cgp grey gear and lightbulb banner hanging from the walls of his throne room . 
  uh , might want to check your figures there . 
  $ 15k per video , one video every other month , would be $ 90k per year . 
  that 's less than # 74k , and that 's with the dollar currently at its highest point relative to the pound in over a decade . 
  probably still good in london . 
  i do n't know what 's considered good in london . 
  but still important to get your numbers right . 
  the only difference outside the realms is that maybe you can take the battleranger subclass without being a dwarf . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  but your table is claiming `` highest level reached '' , not `` current level '' . 
  and in the typical high-fantasy setting like the realms it 's even higher than in real-world history . 
  being an `` adventurer '' is a common acceptable career or pastime , in addition to things like military , town guard , etc. 
  a white tongue ? 
  that 's not a metaphor i 'm familiar with ( and neither is google -- who seems to only know of it as an actual medical issue ) . 
  what is a white tongue ?

  it 's 5 bars of exactly the same , followed by 2 bars of something slightly different but with the same problem . 
  then back to the first thing again .

  it 's an ancient game . 
  literally any modern mac will run it just fine . 
  if you want my opinion though , it 's kind of a crap game compared to age of mythology and age of empires iii . 
  no it is n't . 
   fun gameplay, 
  i thought origins had the * worst * gameplay of any game that i 've finished . 
  the story was great enough that i forced my way through the game , but i found the gameplay itself absolutely abysmal . 
  i 'd love to replay it just to get a different story , but i could n't even finish the expansion once i was done with the base game because i just got so sick of its mechanics . 
  i do n't really think that 's a good example of ludonarrative . 
  ludonarrative means that the game * mechanics * align with its story . 
  what you 're describing there is just ... well , narrative . 
  when you 're in a horror survivalist world and the game makes you feel like you really do need to conserve ammo because it 's so scarce and if you run out of ammo you 'll almost certainly die . 
  * that * is good ludonarrative . 
  and i believe tlou is good in that respect -- it 's just that you pointed to the wrong explanation for it . 
  whereas if it 's meant to be a survivalist world but ammo crates are fucking everywhere , that 's an example of ludonarrative dissonance . 
  it does n't run on modern versions of macos . 
  you either need bootcamp to run it in windows , or some other workaround . 
  and how did you do that ? 
  i 'm still rockin ' the last reasonably priced apple laptop to have a discrete graphics card * at all * . 
  i 'm so upset that they no longer sell non-retina 15 inch mbps . 
  i would have to pay over ** $ 3500 ** to get a discrete graphics card today because only the * very highest end * laptop has one . 
  and that 's * after * educational discount . 
   max low settings, 
  it 's a civ game . 
  30 fps is * more * than adequate . 
  hey / u/stolksdorf , do you have any idea why it would be that when i click the above homebrewery link , it displays one way , but when i view that link 's source and copy it into my own version ( to make an a4 printer friendly version ) :, 
  ( a ) i lose the indentation , and, 
  ( b ) half the pages seem to be randomly ignoring the first column, 
  but that 's the thing i do n't understand . 
  when i view yours , it looks fine . 
  but then i click the `` source '' button in the top right , which * should * show the source exactly as you wrote it ( though perhaps it 's parsing the \\ & nbsp ; when it should n't ) , it all goes into one line . 
  regarding b , i 'm not sure * why * it was happening , but fixing the few lines where you ended with a single space or no spaces , rather than the two necessary to force a line break ( a quick substitute of ` % s / ( \\ s ) [ ] ? \\ n / \\ 1 \\ n/g ` fixed that ) , along with fixing the indentation issue , seems to have stopped b from occurring . 
  incidentally , switching to a4 pages seems to be making all the letters instantly fit at the bottom of the page , which is nice . 
  anyway , [ here 's the result of my labour ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/r1zldkztkx ) . 
  a4 , printer friendly , and also contains letter headings to make it a little easier to quickly scan . 
  ( p.s. , i 'm not really sure i 'd call an html entity `` code '' . ), 
  $ 70.00 usd in australia . 
  that 's over ** $ 90 ** aud . 
  this is why i 'm a [ / r/patientgamer ] ( / r/patientgamers ) . 
  what are the features you consider basic that are n't in the game yet ? 
  i have n't bought it and wo n't be doing so for probably a couple of years yet ( i 'm * more than * happy with civ v ) , but i 'm curious about what the state of the game is so far .
