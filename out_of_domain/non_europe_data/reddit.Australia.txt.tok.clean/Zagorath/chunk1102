  you can easily remove it on subsequent paragraphs by wrapping those paragraphs in a < div  . 
  it works since the automatic indentation is * looking * for a paragraph tag that follows another paragraph tag . 
  and adding indentation can be done by adding \\ & nbsp ; five times ( or however many you want ) to the start of the paragraph . 
  a `` no break space '' means it gets rendered literally and does n't get sucked up by the markdown parser . 
  [ see the source of this for an example ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/bj4g-xajl ) . 
  you can get something that looks more elegant ( without the larger vertical gap between paragraphs ) , or that will consistently * automatically * do the formatting for you every time , by playing around with the css . 
  but this 'll work in a pinch . 
  wtf is a period ? 
  this is n't america . 
  just stop responding mate . 
  it 's not worth it . 
  ` do n't feed the trolls ' , as they say . 
  i do n't , mostly . 
  how perfectly cromulent of you . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  you mean ` e.g. ', 
  here , not ` i.e. ', 
  ` i.e. ', 
  effectively means ` that is ' , which indicates it 's referring to an * exhaustive * list . 
  unless liches and ancient dragons are the * only * creatures that get legendary actions ( i do n't actually know for certain , maybe they are -- in which case carry on as you were ) , ` i.e. ', 
  is incorrect here . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  to get * paragraphs * to display correctly on reddit , you need to hit * enter * two times . 
  pressing space twice and enter once will introduce a line break , which is n't the same thing and can cause formatting issues like you 've got here .

   which would n't happen under the electoral college as it is winner take all per state, 
  that 's what my suggestion changes . 
  each state elects at least 3 ec voters . 
  i 'm suggesting that these would be elected not as winner-takes all , but using stv . 
  already two states do n't use winner-takes all , so it would n't be totally unprecedented .

  so `` not woke '' is a dumber way of saying `` unenlightened '' ? 
  i think that by `` the firefly of dc tv '' they were more referring to the fact that it was a fantastic show that got cancelled way too early , rather than anything about relationships . 
  [ i reckon pocket casts would give them a pretty good run for their money . 
  completely agree . 
  the fact that i would have to pay over $ 3500 to get an apple laptop with a discrete graphics card today is just * infuriating * . 
  and that 's * after * applying a student discount . 
  my 2012 non-retina mbp is the last time apple made anything close to what i would consider a reasonable laptop for the high but not ultra-high end of the market . 
   if anything it 's made me glad i bought my macbook pro when i did ( 2012 retina ) , because they have n't released once since that 's made me regret not waiting another year . 
  ditto , except 2012 non-retina , because i do enough video editing and gaming that the discrete graphics card ( which today is only available in the very highest-end retina , which would cost me over $ 3500 to get -- which is insane ) that it came with is indispensable . 
  oh interesting , i was n't aware . 
  mine 's the 650 , so i 'd guess that 's probably what yours is too . 
  i have to agree . 
  today , there are really only two things that would cause me to consider my next laptop being a mac . 
  the exclusive macos software ( chiefly final cut pro , which is literally light years ahead of all of the competition for prosumer level video editing ) and the fact that 's it 's a unix-based operating system . 
  and with the latest version of windows apparently having a bash terminal ( my windows install on my desktop is n't updating properly so i ca n't figure out how to use bash with it , or how well it works ) , one of those two reasons might not be relevant any more . 
  it used to be that the hardware and build quality were * enormous * reasons . 
  and they 're still a factor -- i 'm yet to use any other trackpad that 's quite as good as apple 's , though other ones are a lot better today than 5 years ago -- but not nearly enough of a factor to justify the price tag given the ailing specs . 
  that 's not so much matt coleville 's description of alignments as * the very definition of what alignments are * . 
  it 's descriptive , not prescriptive . 
   he 'd never met a wizard who cast spells like that . 
   sorcerer , he corrected himself . 
  wizards have books . 
  sorcerers just have magic . 
  -- evans e.m. , '' * brimstone angels * '' , chapter 2 . 
  it 's in relation to someone seeing the protagonist ( a warlock , in actuality ) casting some spells ( * eldritch blast * , * fire bolt * , and some other less easily identified spells ) . 
  and then later on , the same character sees the protagonist talking with a devil , and he says :, 
   `` it looks like you have a pact with a fiend . 
  it looks like you 're not so much a sorcerer as ... as a warlock . '', 
  point being , you 're completely correct that in a setting like the realms , many people * would * easily recognise the difference between a wizard and a sorcerer , largely thanks to the spellbook . 
  the magic itself is less of a way to differentiate between sorcerers and warlocks , unless you happen to specifically know that only warlocks have access to * eldritch blast * ( someone who has specifically studied magic might know this , but the average person probably not ) , or some other type of thinking , but again the average person likely will know that if they see someone who has magic talking to devils , they 're probably a warlock not a sorcerer . 
  the oathbreaker in the dmg is a really poor choice for something to give someone who simply failed to uphold their oath , in my opinion . 
  if someone fails to uphold their oath , as far as i 'm concerned they simply lose their non-martial class abilities until they atone . 
  ` oathbreaker ' works best for a character who specifically * wants * to be evil . 
  whose oath in some way relates to evil . 
  it 's poorly named . 
  the way extra attack interacts ( or rather , * does n't * ) with readied actions and opportunity attacks is something that players at my table always get wrong . 
   the identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item 's properties . 
  alternatively , a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest , while being in physical contact with the item . 
  at the end of the rest , the character learns the item 's properties , as well as how, 
  to use them . 
  potions are an exception ; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does . 
  yeah , i 'm in aus . 
  when you 're on mobile , the site auto-detects that and ( unless they 've specifically requested the desktop version ) switches them to the mobile site . 
  could we get the opposite as well ? 
  i 'll frequently google for a past reddit thread , and for some reason m.reddit.com links are really common there . 
  it 'd be nice if it could detect that i 'm on a computer and give me the desktop version of the site . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  gods bloody damn it . 
  and i still ca n't find it anywhere . 
  on the beams tab of the keypad ( the third tab across ) , two of the buttons along the bottom are for feather-beams . 
   the best way to save on space is to do something about those monster stat blocks , cause the default 5e block is poorly designed ... have some experiments making your own block design, 
  strongly disagree . 
  the default 5e stat block is just fine . 
  but even if it has some minor issues with it , it 's what people are familiar with , so to make it easy for people to read , we should aim to emulate it . 
  was he appearing posthumously in this episode , or was it a different actor ? 
  they actually explicitly say that the thing that aged her body also aged her mind , if that helps . 
  well , not if a game was played today . 
  then it would be spring and autumn . 
  4s open doors !, 
  regarding 3 , there 's is actually ** no ** minimum word count . 
  3000 is just kind of a recommended minimum . 
  if your essay relies * really * heavily on material that does n't count as part of the word count , like a whole heap of maths equations , it 's totally feasible to have a really low word count . 
  she appeared in a couple of episodes at the beginning , and then left . 
  it 's not really a generalised america sub , it 's specifically for photos , like / r/britpics or / r/australiapics . 
  it 's just not fantastically named . 
  i 'm removing this because of rule 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented .
