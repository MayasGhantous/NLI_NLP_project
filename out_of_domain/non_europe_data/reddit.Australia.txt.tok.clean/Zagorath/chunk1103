  frankly i suspect that this is trolling , but if it 's not , that kri is so far from playable that it qualifies for rule 1 . 
  if you are sincere , post on the arcana forge megathread for advice . 
  as a general rule , avoid anything from d and wiki at all costs . 
  a character sheet would not be against the rules as far as i am concerned . 
  it would be classified as a resource . 
  that said , this is n't necessarily the * best * place for it . 
  / r/dndnext is likely to have a bigger audience . 
  what * is * against the rules , however , is posting content that is n't usable in its current form . 
  for example , asking a question about what 's allowed . 
  so i am removing this post . 
  in the future , this sort of question is best asked by sending a message to the subreddit 's moderators . 
   add double proficiency bonus to any checks using the skill ? 
  reads like it 's additive to the usual modifiers . 
  it should read something like the rogue expertise instead : `` your proficiency bonus is doubled for any checks using the chosen skill or tool '' . 
  i do n't agree . 
  5e rules are quite clear on the matter . 
  proficiency bonuses can be multiplied but you ca n't add it from multiple sources at once . 
  the wording op uses is completely fine . 
  i would be very interested to see that , but i do n't think there 's any need for a pm . 
  post it here so others can see . 
  if your reasons are sound , then you may convince many people to adopt your preference . 
   the importance and level of applicability of what he 's saying is grossly overstated , but i appreciate the insight it provides, 
  this is a good summary of all of grey 's videos imo . 
  and something very similar to it can be applied to other educational youtubers like crashcourse . 
  but do n't tell the people of this sub that . 
  you make some very good points and i think having a sort of ` compressed ' monster stat block would be a good idea , and could then point to the mm or the book 's appendices for the full stat block . 
  the shorter one would need to be sufficient to run the monster at its most basic , but might be lacking some of the more tactical and complicated features . 
   i have my own design i use for my adventures, 
  you do ? 
  [ i had a look at your profile history ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b1ala1t8isuhdhftz0nqa1lasnc/view ) , and i 'm not seeing it . 
  your braigar , for example , looks exactly like the standard msb , except with slightly different dressing . 
  the layout and general format is exactly the same . 
  make sure that the beams are all connected fully before you add the feathering . 
   it 's also very thematic , do n't you think ? 
  in fact , the first thing i thought when i read your initial question was `` no , because that does n't make sense '' . 
  how does being really dextrous make you good at physically holding someone and stopping them from moving ? 
  to me the balance considerations are secondary to that simple logic . 
  i 'd say if the robe has to be pulled over your head , that 's an action . 
  if it 's tied on and can simply be slipped off , that 's a free item interaction . 
   because robes that would give you a magical benefit should require attunement over a short rest, 
  you could already be attuned to it though . 
   might even be able to customize the touchbar from bootcamp , too !, 
  fat chance . 
  they do n't even have smooth scrolling on the touchpad despite that feature being available to os x/macos for a decade . 
  or $ 3,000 for the one they did n't mention in the keynote with the old form factor . 
  probably still last gen specs too , i 'm not sure . 
  when i got my first mac in ~ 2010 , it was a 13 inch macbook pro . 
  i think it was something like $ 1600 aud . 
  today , the cheapest mbp is $ 2000 and the specs are , relative to the time , worse . 
  that 's for the * old * form factor , with the thicker body ( and usb ports , magsafe , etc. 
  ) , that they never mentioned in the keynote . 
  $ 2200 for the cheapest thing that they announced . 
  with prices like that , i never would have bought my first mac and would n't be using one today . 
  i worry that apple is going to lose an enormous amount of potential customers by no longer supporting that entry level for users who want specs for things like video editing , photo editing , and a bit of gaming . 
  all of the new 15 inches have a discrete gpu . 
  they still sell some of the old 15 inches without gpus , but they also did n't get processor boosts i do n't think . 
  it 's $ 3600 aud in australia , despite the aussie dollar being * ever so slightly * ** stronger ** than the cad . 
  there are also melee attacks , melee weapon attacks , and attacks with a melee weapon , all of which mean something * slightly * different . 
  ** stlarning hrast ** wizards get a thesaurus !, 
  class and race names , too . 
  that way we would have a concrete way of differentiating between a barbarian who 's a part of a tribe of uncivilised people , and a barbarian who is a warrior that channels his rage to empower him in battle . 
  but no , both of those are spelt with a lower case ` b ' . 
  stop reporting comments that a critical of you . 
  they are clearly not in violation of any rules . 
  i 've never come up with a character concept that would n't benefit from at least 1 feat , and all of the characters i 've actually * played * have either used or wanted at least 2 . 
  i really like feats as they are . 
  the only thing i would have changed is the way they describe it . 
  have feats be included by default ( but work exactly as they do now ) , and mention that if a dm wants , she can exclude them as an option . 
  regarding saving throws , charisma saves are about maintaining your force of personality on the world . 
  they resist banishment type effects . 
  intelligent saves are about maintaining your mental capacities . 
  they resist mind flayer type mental attacks . 
   the dms who do n't get this are nearly always always long rests too often . 
  no , the game * designers * did n't * get * that most dms today are playing in a way that makes long rests more frequent than they were planning for . 
  yeah , if we * try * , it 's possible to get 6 -- 8 encounters in a day . 
  but that feels completely unnatural and ruins the narrative unless you 're playing a boring dungeon crawl . 
  not even lucky ? 
  these are n't * above * the function keys , they 're * replacing * them . 
  ( with the ability to switch back to them being function keys if desired -- but still as soft keys . ), 
  have you ever used a programme where regardless of keyboard layout , the same button on the keyboard would perform a certain function ? 
  ( very common in games , for example . 
  would n't want french people with their azerty to have to manually remap wasd to zqsd , or dvorak users with < aoe . ), 
  that 's a bit of a give away that the hardware is operating at a lower level than ascii , and that it is possible for software to directly know exactly which hardware key you 're pressing as a distinct entity from the character that key represents . 
  personally , i do n't . 
  like , i just put it in there , but never think of what it 's called . 
  but i also do n't do it very often . 
  whenever i can , i do smaller tasks just by adding an ` alias ` into my ` . bash_profile ` , and for bigger things i most often find python more useful . 
   i call the ` symbol `` backtick '' , without having a clue what it 's proper name is, 
  wait what ? 
  i thought backtick * was * its proper name . 
  i ca n't speak for azerty , but my experience with dvorak has been that the majority of recent games either read the hardware directly , and present on-screen prompts as if i were using qwerty ( for example , telling me to press w to go forward , but then i press the key that would normally type , and it goes forward ) , or they detect that i 'm using dvorak and automatically display prompts correctly . 
  only a few games , mostly older ones or ones from smaller developers , require me to either remap or temporarily switch my keyboard layout to qwerty in order to play properly . 
  also a no break space in latex , to mean `` approximately '' , and when writing formal logic as the negation symbol . 
  tom scott and matt gray . 
  they do a bunch of stuff together like citation needed and the park bench . 
  the idea is that it 's meant to be a new input device . 
  they 've just retained the ability to switch back to function keys as a fallback so it 'll still work with applications that have n't been designed with this specifically in mind . 
   charisma seems to be the primary spell casting ability score now which governs 3 full spell casting classes : paladin , sorcerer and the warlock, 
  you mean bard , sorcerer , and warlock , surely ? 
  paladin is a half caster .
