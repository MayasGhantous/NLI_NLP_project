  so charisma gets three and a half , while wisdom gets two and a half casters . 
  intelligence , meanwhile , gets one and two thirds . 
  two very lacklustre thirds . 
  it will probably not surprise you to know that python is what the pagebot is written in . 
  *** so *** good . 
  nobody here is being an arsehole or hating . 
  all of the criticism is respectfully presented . 
  you need to stop taking it so personally . 
  yeah that 's a better symbol to use when possible , but it 's not on the standard keyboard so the tilde is often more useful . 
  really ? 
  i just switched my keyboard layout to british . 
  it 's still doing a tilde for me . 
  my os has another option for `` british -- pc '' , in which case left of 1 is \\ , and shifting that is | . 
  what are the semantics of a tuple vs a list in python ? 
  how tightly does the ternary operator bind ? 
  i do n't know , but i 'm going to guess the answer is `` not very '' , and that your example is correct . 
  i would argue that even in that case , code of the above format would be bad design just because of ambiguity to the reader . 
  put some brackets in there to clarify things , even if it executes the same . 
  weirdly enough , you have * better * options to watch aussie sports if you 're * out of the country * than you do living here . 
  my parents can watch more of the broncos games living in ho chi minh city than i can here in brisbane . 
  not sure exactly what service they use , i think it 's called `` expat tv '' or something similar . 
  we 've already got netflix , stan , and presto . 
  we 've also got ( in a * slightly * different market , but somewhat related ) youtube red , and googling suggests there 's something called quickflix , but i 'm not sure what they do exactly . 
  then there 's things like abc iview and i think the other free-to-air channels have catch-up services . 
  i 'd say the amount of competition in the market is pretty good currently . 
  it 's just that none of them have a particularly fantastic range of content . 
  that 's the practical difference , not the semantic one . 
  huh , til . 
  also til : phishing 's etymology is related to the blue boxes , and by extension to the founding of apple . 
  in particular , practically , a tuple will of course be useable any time you have some data to wrap up in a list-like structure that will never change . 
  obviously , / u/secondsemblance 's example fits this . 
  but / u/overactor was claiming that `` that 's not what tuples are for '' because `` the semantics are completely off '' . 
  i want to know what the reason for that is . 
  so , first of all even if that 's true , it 's beside the point . 
  because yay for broncos fans , but definitely not all the other teams are so lucky . 
  i just used the broncos because that 's the example that personally matters to * me * . 
  but i do n't even think that 's true . 
  i do n't watch or try to watch every game . 
  but of the times i did try , i found that ( not counting finals season ) about half the time i would sit down to find channel 9 playing some reality show or something instead . 
  maybe that 's just down to bad luck in which ones i chose , but on the probability of it i 'm guessing not . 
  huh , i did n't know stravinsky ever saw a smalin video . 
  i 'm not surprised he 'd consider them miraculous , though . 
  not just disabling the basic suggested autoplay functionality , but also watching videos in a playlist . 
  i tend to throw all the videos from my subscriptions inbox into my watch later playlist so that they autoplay one after the other . 
  if i 'm busy doing something else at the same time i might just let the ad play . 
  but if i 'm not doing something else , or what i am doing is easily interrupted , i usually manually tell it to go to the next video well before the actual end of the video : once they start talking the credits or thanking their sponsors . 
  lol they deleted them ? 
  i know they were getting terrible feedback , but cancelling the whole show after just 2 episodes ? 
  that 's * insane * !, 
  have hank or john made a video talking about this yet ? 
  i 'm guessing they probably recorded before the event . 
  because overactor is saying that there is a * semantic * difference between the two . 
  something beyond the functional difference . 
  you are aware of what the word ` semantic ' means , i assume ? 
  i do n't know how to go about checking ahead of time where each game 's going to be played . 
  i just get a google now card each week telling me what time they 're playing , and if i 've got the spare time i switch on channel 9 . 
  not counting finals ( or origin , obviously ) , i 'd guess i tried to watch maybe 10 games , scattered throughout the year . 
  i think about 4 times i found reality shows or a movie on instead . 
  as i said , * maybe * i just happened to stumble upon literally the only 4 times the broncos were n't shown , but i think that unlikely . 
  and 60 % of games is very far from `` almost exclusively '' . 
  even 70 or 80 % would be hard pressed to describe that way . 
  but none of this goes against my initial actual argument that you have better options overseas . 
  so it 's kind of a moot point . 
  my parents * never * have to worry about whether the game they want to watch will be shown . 
  they can live stream * every * game they want to watch and never have to even * consider * the whims of channel 9 . 
  semantics refers to the underlying meaning behind how the thing should be used . 
  i think reading [ overactor 's definition ] ( / r/programmerhumor/comments / 59uaji/rme _ irl_meets_rprogrammerhumor / d9ci0vg ) of how the semantics of tuples are supposed to work kind of clears it up . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with it -- personally i do n't really know , i do n't use tuples very often -- but it 's useful for clarifying what a semantic definition is . 
  another example might be to look at google 's definition of what is and is not a ` constant ' :, 
   every constant is a static final field , but not all static final fields are constants . 
  before choosing constant case , consider whether the field really feels like a constant . 
  for example , if any of that instance 's observable state can change , it is almost certainly not a constant . 
  merely intending to never mutate the object is generally not enough . 
  that 's a semantic definition of what a constant is , only loosely related to the language 's syntax of what a ` static ' variable is . 
  from what i gathered , people were upset that they criticised the notion of environmental determinism , but they never gave proper explanations of * why * it 's so bad . 
  they just kinda said `` it 's bad because some people who believe in it also tied it to racism , and now we can never study how the environment influences cultures and their relative success again '' . 
  it was all really dismissive . 
  i 've only just looked at the first few questions so far , but i 'm already feeling that a lot of the questions were somewhat poorly worded . 
  `` another private location '' is really vague . 
  i feel like `` at one of the player 's homes '' would be a good option to have , because after `` at home '' ( which presumably means at the dm 's home ) , it 's probably the most obvious second choice . 
  `` my own personal setting '' is another vague one . 
  what if it 's a setting made by one of the players , or collaboratively made by the whole gaming group , or a setting someone else i know made but is n't properly published ? 
  edit :, 
  then you get to stuff about different types of preparation . 
  to be honest i found this hard to answer in general because i do n't compartmentalise everything that much . 
  but more importantly than that , i noticed you asked for a total prep time , and then asked to break it down . 
  is the total time question there as a sort of checksum ? 
  because if so , my answer is going to * look * incorrect . 
  but the thing is i do n't count worldbuilding as part of my main session prep . 
  building the world is something i enjoy doing in its own right and is n't really a part of session prep . 
   first , it 's just a different cable , not an adapter . 
  what cable does the iphone come with ?
