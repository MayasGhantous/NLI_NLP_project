  i do n't feel like watching the video itself , but based on the title , that 's not brisbane . 
  woodridge is in logan , according to wikipedia , which confirms what the video titles says . 
  hands down the single best episode of legends they 've ever done , in my opinion . 
  i 've been * really * negative on that show in the past , but i loved it this week . 
  your above comment said it was * in * brisbane . 
  that is what i was correcting . 
  logan is not brisbane any more than the gold coast is . 
  i do n't have a full album , but here are a few of my favourites ( all from the / r/dndgreentext [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) ) . 
  * [ an evil necromancer in an online solo game ] ( https://i.imgur.com/radm2.jpg ), 
  * [ the mechanic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mfjs5t8.png?1 ) ( star wars game -- unfortunately including this one in this list is a spoiler in itself . ), 
  * and arguably , depending on how you look at it [ demigods ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pnwyj ) ( warning , ** very ** long story ) . 
  honestly i feel exactly the opposite . 
  one of the most important features of an ide , to me , is suggesting methods and reminding you of their arguments . 
  that little pop up that tells you all the methods that start the way you 've started typing . 
  i ca n't for the life of me get intellij to make that window expand to describe the method and its arguments . 
  eclipse does what i want automatically . 
  literally every other feature i personally care about , they 're equal . 
  but this one is infuriating . 
  that 's referred to as `` muphry 's law '' . 
  no , that was n't a typo .

  i believe the idea is that in this family , the name is passed down through the matriarchal line . 
  someone in another thread said that there is historical precedent in japan to this . 
  i just tried that . 
  i guess it would be a decent workaround if it worked properly . 
  but it does n't . 
  i had to try multiple times to get it working . 
  but even if it did work perfectly , it 's still not as good as eclipse which just does it automatically for me . 
  nexus 4 , 5 , and 6 were all named after sizes . 
  coincidentally , each of them was * also * the 4th , 5th , and 6th nexus phones released , respectively . 
  i assumed they were talking about [ danse macabre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecozmtblrp0 ) . 
  i would avoid * force bolt * because that steps on * eldritch blast * 's toes . 
  maybe not , but you should definitely get that race condition checked out . 
  in underlying version numbers , microsoft actually skipped from 6 all the way to 10 . 
  windows vista was 6.0 . 
  windows `` 7 '' was actually version 6.1 . 
  windows 8 and 8.1 were 6.2 and 6.3 , respectively . 
  then when they skipped windows 9 and went to 10 , they decided to do the same thing with the version numbers . 
  since the 3 . x days , all the publicly announced names have been unrelated to their version numbers . 
  but in actual version numbers , they skipped from 6.3 ( windows 8.1 ) all the way to 10 . 
  vista was the first of the 6 . x line under the hood . 
  it 's not 100 % algorithmic . 
  they have some algorithm ( which we do n't precisely know ) that produces a bunch of possible trending subreddits . 
  from those , they * choose * a selection of subs to actually be trending . 
  it 's why there are often clear patterns in the trending subreddits for a day . 
  you know what * does * make a big difference for video editing ? 
  graphics cards . 
  and i ca n't buy an apple laptop with a discrete gpu for anywhere under * $ 3,500 * . 
  that is utterly insane , and it 's something that makes a significant difference to my use of the computer . 
  i 'll be hanging on to my 2012 non-retina mbp for as long as i possibly can , but after that i 'm honestly worried i 'll have to switch to something else . 
  australian, 
  aud, 
   what are you losing when spending the final panache point ? 
  surely by then you have no attacks remaining , so you might as well spend one more point ? 
  assuming they go with your suggestion to refresh at the * end * of your turn , having one panache point remaining means they can still make a single attack when their turn comes around . 
  unless i 'm misreading it ? 
  i agree with / u/seb _ veteran-sleeper that panache should be worded to say it refreshes at the end of your turn . 
  the current wording is a poor one . 
  but i would also say , i am really not a fan of the name '' *** panache *** '' . 
  panache refers to flamboyancy and recklessness . 
  it makes sense in the context of a swashbuckling rogue , but not so much when you 're talking about a fighter trained in precision and speed . 
  i think panache should be renamed . 
  i also think the wording `` equal to your base number of attacks plus 1 '' is not very appropriate . 
  what is `` base number of attacks '' ? 
  arguably , a character who is duel-wielding has 2 attacks at level 1 , and 3 and level 5 . 
  instead , you should word it something like, 
   upon selection of this archetype , you gain a number of special points -- called panache -- equal to 1 . 
  expending a panache point during combat reduces the number of attacks you may make when you take the attack action on your turn by the number of panache points spent . 
  panache may be spent at any time and does not consume an action , bonus action , or reaction unless specifically stated in the feature . 
   you regain any expended panache points at the end of each of your turns . 
   your maximum number of panache points increases by 1 at 5th level ( 2 ) , 11th level ( 3 ) , and 20th level ( 4 ) -- each time your extra attack ability increases the number of attacks you may make using the attack action on your turn . 
  alternatively ( and i 'm personally not a fan of this , but it would be a significant improvement over what you have currently ) , you could say `` you have a number of panache points equal to the number of attacks you can make when you take the attack action on your turn . '', 
  the other replies have already done a good job of pointing out the mechanical issues with this option , so all i 'll say is i agree with those . 
  going through these from top to bottom . 
  * the funny slurs in that first example certainly are odd , but it 's pretty clear what is meant . 
  the times it goes backward are never in the music itself , only to allow it to fit around notes . 
  still , very interesting to see . 
  * triplets that run through an entire piece are * normally * not shown after the first bar or two . 
  it would be more unusual to see a score for beethoven 's sonata no . 
  14 or schubert 's impromptu no . 
  2 that * did * include each and every triplet marking . 
  * the ` incorrectly ' joined voices are very curious . 
  if i were notating it i probably would have had them separate but joined by a tie , rather than joining the noteheads . 
  * playing the notes from right to left with that notation is very curious . 
  does anyone know how that passage is normally played ? 
  if i came across it , i probably would have played the b natural at the start of that bar as part of a grace note with the e. 
  * i 've often wished there were a ` half-dot ' , so to speak . 
  a way to tie a quaver to a demisemiquaver without actually doing that . 
  apparently brahms and bach were happy just using a normal dot and letting context fill things in . 
  quite clever really . 
  * the next two excerpts are quite an interesting way to go about things . 
  * as much as i appreciate making the harmonic context clear , i definitely would prefer to just see a g sharp rather than an f triple sharp . 
  double sharps are completely fine though .
