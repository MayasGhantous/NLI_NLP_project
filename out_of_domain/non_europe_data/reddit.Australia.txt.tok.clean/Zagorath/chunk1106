  that 's a really beautiful photo of the back of the chair in front of you . 
  not sure what the title has to do with that though . 
  to be honest i think the australian uber competitor ( i forget its name ) has the best solution . 
  a simple thumbs up and down rating system . 
  regan and thatcher , together , are almost single-handedly responsible for the entire modern economic climate wherein an extreme right-wing point of view is almost perceived as the * norm * in many western countries , and moderate , sensible economic plans are seen as * at best * left-leaning , and often are dismissed as extremist nanny-statism . 
  the two of them have had an absolutely * horrendous * impact on history . 
  uh mate , you ca n't link us to a file on your own hard drive . 
  the first thing that strikes me is that this is currently completely devoid of flavour . 
  it desperately needs a few paragraphs at the beginning describing to me what this class is like . 
  some art would also not go unappreciated . 
  but mechanically ,, 
  there is no such thing as a perform ( dance ) skill . 
  you 're looking for `` proficiency in performance . '', 
  prestige classes should not have `` hit points at 1st level '' because you can not choose them at first level . 
  darkvision should be worded in the same way as other places that you can gain darkvision , including describing what it actually means . 
  shadow attack is referring to the rogue 's sneak attack ability . 
  but there is no requirement that a character be a rogue . 
  how does this work if they are not a rogue ? 
  it should be worded mostly as an ability that can stand on its own , and if you want it to synergise with sneak attack in any way , or point out any ways in which it does * not * synergise , make that a small note at the end . 
  not the default assumption . 
  shadow jump has a typo on `` opportunity '' . 
  it also says attacks of opportunity '' rather than `` opportunity attacks '' . 
  it also allows you to get the shadow monk 's `` shadow step '' ability with far , * far * less investment in levels . 
  this is breaking one of the golden rules of homebrew : never outshine official material at that official material 's main feature . 
  shadow dance should probably say something about `` any creatures of your choosing that can see you '' , rather than `` non-allies '' . 
  referring to `` allies '' is a very odd and poorly worded choice , and making it creatures that can see you just makes sense for the ability . 
  also , it should be a charisma ( performance ) check . 
  they should be mesmorised `` until the end of your next turn '' or `` end of their next turn '' or something like that . 
  make it clear exactly when the ability ends . 
  shadow dance fails to mention at which level you gain it in the ability itself . 
  just having it in the table is insufficient . 
  casting * mirror image * up to five times per day is way too powerful . 
  neat ability , but this feels like a once per short rest kind of deal * at most * . 
  overall , i feel like this is too powerful . 
  i 'm getting some awful munchkiny vibes off of it . 
  it reminds me of why a lot of people had negative reactions to the idea of prestige classes in 5e . 
  it 's not unsalvageable though , i do n't think . 
  just needs some tweaking down in power level ( not sure exactly how best to achieve that ) . 
  that , plus the aforementioned wording corrections , flavour text , and art . 
  it also looks so out of place compared to their other images . 
  the new contact us image feels way more appropriate to their design . 
  actually it struck me that when grey was talking about being the same * but also unobtrusive * , scott 's very much * not * unobtrusive red shirts might be what he was thinking of . 
  in the discussion about the number of ads on a single video , you missed out one of the most obvious ones as far as impacting the user 's experience : the in-video sponsorships , like many creators have with audible or whatever . 
  you may have only intended to talk about ads that youtube put their , but these ads are far more obvious than the stuff off by the side or below the video is , so in my mind they count way more than those . 
  can confirm , grey , youtube red is available here in australia as well as the us . 
  new zealand has it as well . 
  wikipedia says mexico also has it , and that 's the entire extent of its availability . 
  huh , weird . 
  i do n't often see people cross-post things out of cc . 
  not in fantasy they are n't , 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  yes it does . 
  and it works just fine . 
  is there no such thing as a hypoallergenic bandaid ? 
  genuine question , as i have no idea . 
  it 's also been cloudy all day , so even if they waited a few hours it would n't have been sunlight . 
  according to the ads i 've watched 5 seconds of on youtube , your dirty underwear will tell you the answer . 
  i think that 's what it was , anyway . 
  you should definitely post stat blocks etc. 
  in / r/unearthedarcana . 
  stuff like that is much more appreciated over there and you can feel comfortable sharing individual bits at a time rather than * only * sharing the whole thing when it 's all done . 
  actually what you * really * want is to use ` style ` tags on the elements themselves , because that way they only things being styled are the things that have successfully downloaded . 
  no use downloading the inline css in the page 's head if your network goes down before the rest of the page loads . 
  different people have different reasons . 
  for some it 's the removal of ports like hdmi , the magsafe charger , and the old style usb . 
  for others , it 's the price . 
  you might say `` was n't that true for all macs ? '', 
  and the answer would be kinda . 
  in the past , most macs have been in that price range where you 're clearly paying a premium for the brand , but it 's also absolutely acceptable because of what you get for that premium ( a variety of things that vary from person to person , but some that i 've heard a lot are the apple trackpad , the comparative increased security , access to macos exclusive software like final cut , and synergy with their ios devices ) . 
  these new macs are a leap ahead of what they used to be in price , to the point where some people who were happy with the prices in the past no longer are quite so willing . 
  for example , i bought my macbook pro in 2012 for about $ 2,200 aud . 
  it 's a 15 inch non-retina with a discrete graphics card . 
  the cheapest mac laptop you can get today with discrete graphics is over $ 3,500 * after * applying an educational discount . 
  ** tl ; dr ** they 're even more expensive than before , and they have less variety in ports . 
  some of these abilities need a bit more flavour . 
  how does a charisma ( athletics ) check make sense ? 
  or charisma ( insight ) ? 
  there needs to be an in-universe explanation for how you 're able to do that . 
  primeval magic is just flat out too powerful . 
  much like when wotc made some sorcerer subclasses that gain extra spells , giving warlocks access to a substantially greater range of spells is a poor design decision . 
  primeval weaponry is fine , so long as it requires the weapon be * two handed * . 
  if that 's meant to be one handed , it 's giving far , * far * too much power . 
  with all resolve steps massively on the toes of dark one 's blessing . 
  yes , you get it 5 levels later , but you also gain temp hp on ** every ** attack , and you gain a * much * larger amount . 
  this is far , * far * too powerful . 
  i would probably make with all resolve function similarly to dark one 's blessing , in that it only procs when an enemy is brought to zero hp . 
  then , because it is admittedly a higher level ability , have it grant half damage in temp hp . 
  still far more than what dob gives you , but probably not so much as to be completely game breaking . 
  might be worth seeing if anyone else has thoughts about the right amount on that one though . 
  if you 're going to play civ ii , i would highly , ** highly ** recommend getting the remake/relaunch of it , civilization ii : test of time . 
  it has * identical * core gameplay , but with slightly updated graphics ( still very dated today ) , and a few completely unique optional gameplay modes , including extended -- which allows you to keep playing on alpha centauri once you reach there , instead of winning -- a fantasy mode -- based on norse mythology -- and a sci-fi mode . 
  no civ game sense then has done all of that . 
  alpha centauri and beyond earth do some similar stuff with the sci-fi , but there 's absolutely nothing that approaches it with the fantasy and the extended normal modes . 
  yes you are . 
  the rune scribe gets what is essentially an asi , but more flexible , and nearly every serious homebrew prc i 've seen has included one . 
  the ability itself is fine . 
  i 'm just not a fan of that way of * wording * it . 
  it 's a fairly clumsy sounding way of going about things and does n't fit in with the way things are worded in the phb . 
  the problem is that this ** is ** `` the exact same thing as another skill '' .
