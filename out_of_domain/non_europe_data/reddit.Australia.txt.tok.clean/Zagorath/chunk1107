  it 's just not buffed minorly , it 's buffed * hugely * . 
  getting temp hp on every attack is an * enormous * boon . 
  if you 're dealing out roughly as much damage as you 're receiving ( which , normally , you wo n't be -- normally you 'll receive ** less ** than you deal out ) , gaining temp hp equal to damage dealt means you end up taking * zero * damage . 
  if you reduce it to half , you 've now got the equivalent of resistance against all damage -- making you resist more than a raging barbarian which only gets physical resistances , and only while raging ; granted , the barbarian has more total hp and probably a higher ac , but the resistances are the same . 
  at 1/3 it 's the same problem , just reduced a little . 
  and remember , all that is assuming you end up taking * as much * as you give out . 
  the less damage you take , relative to how much you deal , the more powerful this effect becomes . 
  and most of the time , you 're taking less than you give out , especially as a warlock who will most of the time be sitting near the back . 
  i can say from my time as a warlock , i was probably receiving about 1/3 as much as i was giving out , which would make that 1/3 temp hp equate to total immunity from damage . 
  could you explain what it actually is ? 
  i 've seen all this controversy about it , but i have no idea what the feature is actually meant to be . 
  unfortunately i 'm still waiting for my new sim to arrive , so i have n't taken my pixel out of the box yet ... 
  remember , the first episode of the show told us that capes somehow ( in this universe ) help with aerodynamics . 
  she needs the cape to be able to fly properly . 
   wizard 's left out the asi from the rune scribe example that they presented, 
  no , they did not . 
  they simply gave it a slight variation of an asi which is in fact exactly as powerful , but also more flexible . 
   which really , a cape would n't help with, 
  yes it would because comic books . 
  i do n't know what it looked like before , but we ** do not ** require you to format things as greentext if you do n't want to . 
  the formatting options are there for people who * do * want to write as greentext . 
  normal prose is completely acceptable here . 
  you should be aware that * any * stories from roleplaying games are welcome here , regardless of writing style . 
  the styling options are there for those who choose to write in the greentext style , but they are not mandatory . 
  i was expecting something to do with isometric drawings . 
  common in architecture and in older rpgs ( both tabletop and computer ) . 
  same basic meaning as the isometries in maths . 
  it 's been a long time since i watched the episode of security now where he goes over it , but i think that because everything important is done client-side , it 's possible to verify the process . 
  i * believe * that your password blob is always decrypted locally , and you can verify by analysing your traffic that what gets sent to them is only the encrypted blob . 
  man i hate you right now . 
  nobody near me will be selling it until like ... the 16th at least . 
  i fucking hate that wizards gives things out early to special stores in the states but the rest of us are left out dry . 
  just release things everywhere at once ffs !, 
  this is the kind of thing that drives people to piracy . 
  does chapters do game books ? 
  i saw evans 's post about that but thought it was only about novels . 
  but speaking of evans , much to my annoyance none of my local book stores seem to sell the devil you know ... 
  nah i have no serious problem with him getting it before the 4/11 early release date . 
  i had a problem with there * being * an early release date . 
  they should release things worldwide at the same time so those of us who are fans of the game but not in the us are n't constantly fucking shafted . 
  time delays are an insanely common reason for piracy . 
  maybe you do n't get it because you 're american , but the rest of the world has to put up with this shit * so much * in television . 
  i would have hoped that the release of a book did n't also have to be like this . 
  what 'd you use for the face colour ? 
  actually you can get got in australia same day as the us ( or next day or something because time zones ) . 
  it 's just that you have to have foxtel ( cable tv ) which is insanely expensive if you want the package that includes got . 
  like $ 100 per month or something -- and you have to sign up for a minimum of a year , so you ca n't just pay for the two or three months got is on air . 
  a better analogy would be any of what i believe americans call ` network ' tv which yeah , we 're way behind on . 
  but no , it 's not a different thing . 
  it 's exactly the same thing on a smaller scale . 
  and in the age of the internet where everyone will be discussing it immediately after it comes out in the us , even a two week delay is unacceptable . 
  i think the ideal person to remake a franchise are those who are fans , but not * super * fans . 
  the kind of casual movie-goer who really enjoyed the thing the first time around -- more than the average joe -- but never got super in-depth with the lore . 
  look at abrams with the force awakens . 
  maybe he * was * one of those super-fans , but i kinda doubt it , i suspect he was just a regular fan . 
  and he made an amazing film . 
  but more importantly than that , as the current top comment implies , there are other elements that are important to making a good film , some of which are out of the director 's control . 
  i 'd say a good script is at least as important , if not more so , than the director 's faithfulness or lack thereof to the franchise . 
   for three , this delay helps local businesses, 
  then send it out to the local game stores here please . 
  but they do n't . 
  not one of my local stores ( in the third largest city in australia ) gets things early . 
  i do n't know if they * literally * do not make this option available here , or if their criteria are just too onerous that none of my local stores meet them . 
  but either way , i 'm left shafted because of it and that leaves me embittered towards wizards . 
  they need to make it much , * much * easier for stores outside the states to get these things early . 
  alternatively , keep the early game store exclusivity in the states and let the rest of the world get it normally at the same time . 
  because they only really seem to care about game stores over there anyway . 
  and look honestly , most of us are going to be pirating the book anyway . 
  a physical copy is great , but sometimes the digital one is more convenient . 
  so it 's nice to have both . 
  but piracy is the * only * option for a digital copy at the moment , so even legitimate purchasers are going to be doing it . 
  when i said `` this is the kind of thing '' , i was more referring to the general case , not with wizards specifically , that time delays in content drive people who would n't otherwise pirate to do so . 
  it 's perhaps a moot point in this case . 
  wait this game is on consoles ? 
  are n't the controls awkward ? 
  it does n't exist if it does n't exist in two places . 
   it matches the rest of the line, 
  that 's the biggest thing to me . 
  the other one just stands out so awkwardly . 
  if they made special limited edition printings of the other books with new covers in the style of the cthulhu one that 'd make sense , but i really ca n't understand how * anyone * would get the alternate cover as it stands .

  the youtube one is lower quality and seems to be slowed down slightly ( presumably to avoid automatic copyright detection ) . 
  question : if you park there at 6 pm , for one hour , it 's now 7 pm , at which point there is no limit to parking time . 
  does that mean you can effectively park at 6 pm for no limit ? 
  i 'm getting cloudflare errors trying to access it . 
  it 's actually just over a $ 7 discount , because you 're forgetting to add in tax . 
  us stores do n't include gst in their stated price . 
   hopefully amazon video follows soon after . 
  netflix needs some serious competition in australia . 
  we 've already got stan and presto as serious competitors . 
  plus , as related substitute products you 've got youtube red , abc iview , and the other free-to-air channels ' catch up services . 
  iview and red are really good , and i 'd guess those other alternatives are decent as well . 
  there 's also something called quickflix , but i dunno how good they are .

  the mods have discussed this amongst themselves in the past . 
  while we are not going to remove posts that do include `` peach '' , we all agree with this op that it is redundant and annoying . 
  i will certainly not be removing this post . 
  the simple fact is that everything shared on here is implicitly requesting feedback . 
  even if the creator thinks it 's the final version , it is n't necessarily perfect and if people can find errors with it or ways in which it could be improved , they should share that . 
  if someone * does n't * want honest critique , they should n't share it on here .
