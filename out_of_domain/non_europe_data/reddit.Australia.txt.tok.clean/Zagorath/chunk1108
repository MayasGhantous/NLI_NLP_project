  `` peach '' is the entire point of this subreddit and it does n't need to be added . 
  the purpose of this thread is to remind people that they do n't need to include peach in the title . 
  it 's like including `` 5e '' in the title . 
  completely unnecessary because every post in the subreddit is about that . 
  we are n't going to * remove * such posts at this time because it is n't per se * hurting * anyone , and we generally prefer to maintain a relatively light hand . 
  but that does n't mean it is n't worth having a little psa saying you * should n't * be doing it anyway . 
  this is completely firefox 's fault . 
  it ignores some of the crucial markup in formatting things on homebrewery . 
  there 's nothing op can do about that . 
  just use chrome . 
  it 's a better browser anyway , even ignoring this particular issue . 
  hey , when you make something in the homebrewery , could you share the link to that as well , even if you 've made your own pdf too ? 
  homebrewery is really much more convenient because people can take it and easily produce their own printer-friendly versions and stuff like that . 
   there is enough from each party to trigger a division, 
  that would be 2 . 
  ( see : [ senate standing orders 100 ( 1 ) ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/chamber_documents/senate_chamber_documents/standingorders/b00/b18#standing-order_c18-100 ) . ), 
  so , aside from the fact that * no * major party supports nuclear ( and i use `` major '' here in the broadest possible sense , to refer to every party with current representation or significant media attention ) power , there is also the fact that , in australia today , nuclear power is a more expensive option than going all-in on renewables . 
  this is n't true for every country , but for us it is , because we currently have * no * investment in nuclear . 
  we would need to build up the whole industry from scratch . 
  getting people who can teach the relevant information at each stage of the plant . 
  getting people who can design the plants , who can build them , who can maintain them , and who can run them . 
  we 'd need far more significant investment in getting the fuel to power them , and in places to store the waste product long-term . 
  in america or other countries that already have nuclear power , it 's a simple matter of scaling up what they already have quite a lot of . 
  but starting from scratch is a huge investment , and with renewables at where they are now , they 're the cheaper option going forward . 
  if we had started on nuclear two or three decades ago , that might have been a good idea , but not today .

   `` she seems less liberal than some of the other die hard liberals '' . 
  sounds silly does n't it ? 
  nope , sounds perfectly sensible . 
  turnbull is less of a die-hard liberal than abbott was , for example . 
  it 's a * little * more weird with labor because they 're essentially a centrist party and being `` die hard centrist '' does n't make a lot of sense , but even then there are ways of looking at it that are still sensible . 
  what 's the piece ? 
  umm , your link does n't include anything . 
  it goes to an empty imgur album . 
  i 'm removing this . 
  if you edit it to have a working link let me know so i can reapprove it . 
   thief rhymes with beef which is steak rhymes with jake, 
  hmm interesting , that 's a step further than i 've usually seen rhyming slang taken . 
  usually in this case a thief would either be a `` beef steak '' or just a `` steak '' , without the additional rhyme . 
  quite a clever little trick your player 's playing there . 
  this is n't a matter of opinion , it 's a matter of fact that has been studied by people much more knowledgeable than you or i. 
  read the report i linked . 
  now , if you have a recent source that claims the contrary i would be interested . 
  you 're right , both are in the same vein . 
  personally i find ` feedback wanted ' slightly less irritating because it is at least clear in its meaning and not some arcane reference most people wo n't understand . 
  peach also carries with it the slightly condescending implication that people would otherwise * not * be critiquing ` honestly ' , which other methods of soliciting feedback lack . 
  but in the general sense , everything should be assumed to be wanting feedback , and so for the most part this sort of title is undesirable . 
  yeah neither did i. 
  and neil patrick harris ( that is who it was , right ? ), 
  as count olaf seems a cool choice . 
   i do most of my work in the federal jurisdiction . 
  you would be amazed at the number of people who bring actions relying on the universal declaration of human rights . 
  that does n't seem entirely unreasonable to me . 
  we are signatories to it , after all . 
  the fact that we have n't enshrined all of its clauses in law is a failure of our politicians . 
  of course they ca n't possibly expect such a case to go anywhere , but the basic idea does n't seem unreasonable . 
  strictly speaking , a tautology is a logical statement that is always true . 
  it 's almost but not * quite * the same thing as redundancy . 
  the opposite of a tautology is a contradiction . 
  let 's encrypt has helped a lot , too . 
  i encrypted my personal site with some other free provider before let 's encrypt was available , and it was a lot of work to figure out . 
  if i had n't been determined to do it as a learning exercise i probably would n't have bothered . 
  but with let 's encrypt it 's almost literally just a single button press . 
  makes it so much easier for people to ensure their site is secure . 
  you use search . 
  either reddit 's built in search ( which allows you to search by flair ) or using google with `` site : reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana '' added in . 
  the rules in the mm for lyncanthropes and vampires are * terrible * they 're unplayably strong . 
  a good playable option for these sorts of things needs to be balanced against * not * taking that . 
  [ here 's the vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) which is frankly one of the * best * pieces of homebrew out there . 
  the advantage of a prestige class is , obviously , that you get to keep an enormous amount of the flavour associated with vampires , while also keeping balanced through a sense of progression as you level up . 
  for something with some vampiric flavour ( but slightly different ) while being lower-key and easier to add in , you could look at [ the vryloka race ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) , based on the race of the same name from heroes of shadow . 
   i 've always found that the left naturally lends itself better to authoritarianism, 
  an ironic claim , considering mainstream politics around the democratic world exists on a spectrum from what the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/ ) describes as `` left-libertarian '' to right-authoritarian . 
  yes , right-libertarians ( the group most often known as just `` libertarians '' ) do exist , but they 're relatively rare . 
  even rarer in democracies are the left-authoritarians . 
  how do executive orders interact with this though ? 
  johnson is very much not left-libertarian . 
  he wants lower taxes and less government spending , less government involvement in healthcare , * no * minimum wage , and has said he 's a fan of ayn rand , the notable * extreme * right-wing writer . 
  he might be described by hardcore libertarians as too far left , but that 's only because he 's slightly more moderate than their absolutely bonkers extremism . 
  by no measure is he a left libertarian . 
  that last bullet point you 've got there is essentially a dumbed down version of instant runoff voting , also known as the alternative vote or preferential voting . 
  it 's essentially the bare minimum you can do to have a not completely shit voting system . 
  that is , it 's not * great * but it 's leaps and bounds ahead of first past the post . 
  for a single-winner competition like the presidency , it 's basically the best you can get . 
  everyone votes [ 1 ] for their preferred candidate , [ 2 ] for their second favourite , etc. 
  ( numbering as many as they want ) . 
  if nobody gets a majority ( 50 % + 1 ) of votes , the * loser * has their votes all redistributed to their second preference . 
  if nobody still has a majority , the process repeats until someone wins . 
  it eliminates the spoiler effect ( see : nader in florida , 2000 ) and allows people to vote for their favourite candidate even if they know they have no chance of winning , which allows burgeoning third-parties to get a foothold . 
  left libertarian can mean a lot of things because the political compass is a rather broad generalisation , only slightly better than just using the words `` left '' and `` right '' and saying nothing more . 
  but in general it 's about being in favour of freedom socially , but regulation economically . 
  most left libertarians would , in addition to the things you describe , support universal healthcare , public education , and government-funded infrastructure improvements . 
  yes , but * mainstream * politics around the democratic world fits onto the line that would , on that graph , be described as roughly y = kx . 
  where k is positive and neither tiny nor huge . 
  stalin and mao certainly . 
  hitler was , despite the name of his party , fairly moderate on economic issues . 
  to quote the pc 's explanation :, 
   economically , hitler was well to the right of stalin . 
  post-war investigations led to a number of revelations about the cosy relationship between german corporations and the reich . 
   once in power , the nazis achieved rearmament through deficit spending .
