   they actively discouraged demand increases because they wanted infrastructure investment . 
  under the reich , corporations were largely left to govern themselves , with the incentive that if they kept prices under control , they would be rewarded with government contracts . 
  hardly a socialist economic agenda !, 
  mussolini i 'm not sure about . 
  i always got the impression he was fairly similar to hitler in this respect , but i ca n't find good sources that indicate how the italian economy was run during his regime . 
  it 's my observations of the real world . 
  compare the republican and democrat parties in the us , or conservative , labour , and lib-dem in the uk , or liberal-nationals , labor , and the greens in australia . 
  they do n't explicitly say it because their business is simply describing what the full compass is and attempting to place existing politicians on that graph . 
  but through observations we can see that most of the mainstream action happens along that y = kx line . 
  as for lying , i 'm not sure when i lied . 
  i made it quite clear what i was doing . 
  taking the pc 's concept and describing which area of their compass is largely considered `` mainstream '' . 
  you poorly interpreted what i said . 
  i ca n't be blamed for that . 
  edit : i just realised exactly * where * you went wrong . 
  you think i said that the pc said, 
   a spectrum from what the political compass describes as `` left-libertarian '' to right-authoritarian, 
  i did not . 
  i said that myself , referencing the pc 's idea of left-libertarian and right-authoritarian as part of my point . 
  which are the `` three great monarchies brought down through ... personal indulgences '' ? 
  far more than three european monarchies fell during queen mary 's life time . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  that was my first thought as well , but she did say * monarchies * , which would imply that the entire line was lost and the country became a republic . 
  even if she was counting the abdication crisis though , that 's still only one out of three . 
  yeah this could be great . 
  i have absolutely no interest in the modern stuff ( my opinion is : why are you playing d&d if you want modern ? 
  there are better systems for that . 
  ) , but if they 're doing weekly uas they can easily do more niche things without it meaning everyone else has to go a whole month without anything useful . 
  i 'm sure * everyone * has * something * niche that they 'd be interested in seeing that 's more likely to see the light of day with weekly releases than monthly . 
  my zip ties * came * in a plastic container with a screw-on lid . 
  not something as robust as what one would call a ` jar ' , but similar nonetheless . 
  eh , in my case the container they came in was literally cheaper than packages containing less ties . 
  i hardly ever actually use them . 
  aye , and that was my question . 
  how did her quote define ` great monarchy ' ? 
  it 's not exactly like there is a strict definition of what makes one monarchy ` great ' and another not . 
  if you 're after novels , probably the best place to start is the sundering series . 
  the sundering is the major event in the realms which explains the changes between 4th and 5th edition . 
  each book in the series focuses on a different set of characters and they 're more loosely related than a strict `` series '' . 
  there are novels dealing with drizzt , farideh , and elminster , as well as three that introduce new characters . 
  personally , i am a huge fan of erin m. evans ' brimstone angels series . 
  the third book in the sundering ( the adversary ) is also the third of the brimstone angels novels , though it 's designed as a decent entry-point if you want to * just * read the sundering without the other brimstone angels . 
  the novels themselves are good , but what 's really great is the detail they give to the realms ' interpretation of devils & the hells , tieflings , and of dragonborn . 
  the quotes from the phb for both the tiefling entry and the dragonborn one come from evans ' novels . 
  and they are all excellently narrated by dina pearlman on audible -- which is more than i can say for the narration of some other fr novels i 've listened to ( john pruden , who did the early elminster novels , pronounced `` fungi '' with a soft g , but `` sigil '' with a hard one . 
  wtf . ), 
  the final book in the brimstone angels series just came out last month . 
  i ca n't comment on its quality as i 've not been able to find it yet in bookstores ( i decided i wanted to read this last one on paper for posterity ) , but the rest of the series is certainly fantastic . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  according to another reply , the habsburgs . 
  forgive me , but is n't it actually \u04e8 ( n ^ ( 1/2 ) ) time ? 
  the number of eyes poked on each step is n ( n +1 ) / 2 , which would be \u04e8 ( n ^ ( 2 ) ) . 
  my intuition is that the inverse of that -- i.e. 
  the number of steps required to fill a given population -- would be n ^ ( 1/2 ) . 
  hey sorry , but this subreddit is for sharing stories about the game , not for requesting help getting in to the game . 
  try / r/dndnext for that . 
  i 'm removing this post from the subreddit . 
  neveretheless , role playing games are not board games . 
  it 's a game of imagination , primarily . 
  for running combat , having some physical tokens to represent location can be immensely helpful , but they are not essential . 
  i have , in the past , used a chess board and lego pieces en lieu of a battle mat , as well as simple rough sketches on plain paper . 
  and of course , ` theatre of the mind ' ( playing without * any * physical markers to represent location ) is entirely possible . 
  all this is explained quite well in the free resources available under the d&d basic rules . 
  you 'll get a much better explanation from reading through that than you could from me . 
  * [ player 's basic rules ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/basicrules_playerv3.4.pdf ), 
  * [ dungeon master 's basic rules ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/dmbasicrulesv.0.3.pdf ), 
  * printer friendly versions of both of the above are available if you search . 
  the starter set includes a physical copy of enough of the rules to get you started , as well as a really greater beginner adventure , your first set of dice , and some pre-made characters . 
  hope that helps !, 
  if not , / r/dndnext is there for you . 
  ah right !, 
  for some reason i was assuming the number of eyes lost at each step would be one more than the last . 
  of course that makes no sense !, 
  it has to double . 
  minor correction though , you 've got an off by one error ( on the constant factors ) , since the first step is only 1 eye . 
  you 're about 5 months ( minus five days ) early fellas . 
  ok i can see why you 'd call ellen degeneres ` wonder gal ' , but who 's the third chick ? 
  i would * comfortably * say sibelius , out of all the options that have been around for more than a month . 
  finale 's interface is utterly unintelligible . 
  it 's supposed to be quite flexible , but the learning curve is so steep that unless you 're really * really * determined to electronically engrave scores with highly unconventional techniques , i would strongly advise against it . 
  the free options are a huge struggle to produce something that does n't look a solutes terrible . 
  i can always tell when i 've been given a score from musescore because they look extremely amateurish . 
  but they do work , and probably are better options than finale . 
  that said , dorico has just come out recently . 
  i 've not had the chance to use it myself yet , but i very much look forward to it . 
  by all accounts , it 's basically sibelius but better . 
  my overall recommendation is probably dorico . 
     a select few local gaming stores if you 're in america, 
  ftfy more, 
  damn . 
  my local store in brissy does n't get them ... what city you in ? 
  it 's more than just `` the devil '' . 
  people literally * die * because of the change over . 
  rates of heart problems , traffic accidents , and suicides all spike when dst starts . 
  and for those who survive that , worker productivity is noticeably lower too ( due to lack of sleep ) . 
  british comedy panel shows are just incredible . 
  when you 've got a country that gold like the bubble and was it something i said can get cancelled after 1 season ( sorry , * series * ) just because everything 's already so saturated , you know you 're in a good place . 
  wizards of aus was the perfect example of what i personally * hate * about australian made tv shows . 
  star wars downunder was a similar example . 
  i enjoyed both of them , but they 're indicative of a wider problem , and i could never say i * loved * them .
