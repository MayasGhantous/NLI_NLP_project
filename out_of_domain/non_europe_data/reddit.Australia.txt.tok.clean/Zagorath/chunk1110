  we have a problem with taking ourselves too seriously . 
  we just ca n't do it . 
  everything 's deliberately making fun of itself or lampshading stereotypes . 
  they ca n't create a world that the audience can truly * believe * in and immerse themselves . 
  and that means that at best , the stuff we make will be * okay * , but never great . 
  you ca n't access iview from overseas , unfortunately , except when they specifically turn it on for special events ( like election coverage ) . 
  what 's the scenario in which more than six keys at once is necessary ? 
  with four modifiers ( control , option/alt , command/win/super , and shift ) you 've still got room for two normal keys at once . 
  i do n't think i 've ever had a keyboard shortcut want more than four keys at once . 
   however , your saves will be average . 
  if you 're going for a defensive build , high dex and con ( to easily get an ac of 18 at 1st level , with a shield ) , that 's two of your strong saves high . 
  as far as i 'm aware , that 's equal to the best anyone can do . 
  whoa !, 
  do n't listen to them . 
  she makes a roll if and * only * if the spell says `` make a { ranged | melee } spell attack '' . 
  if it does n't say that , she does n't roll anything ( except damage ) . 
  if it says `` the target must make a saving throw '' , then the target of the spell has to roll a saving throw against her spell save dc ( 8 + proficiency modifier + ability score modifier ) . 
  * some spells , like * fireball * or * suggestion * will * only * include a saving throw , and the player does n't roll anything . 
  * others , like * ray of frost * will * only * require an attack roll , in which case she rolls against their ac . 
  * some require no rolls at all , except for damage ; * magic missile * is an example of such a spell . 
  * and finally , some abilities will involve both an attack roll and a saving throw . 
  i ca n't think of any spells that do this ( though there might be some that i 've forgetting ) , but the wolf 's ** bite ** attack requires the wolf make an attack roll against the player 's ac , and if it hits , the player must make a saving throw or be knocked prone . 
   shield has never really recovered since , both as an organization , but as a show , either . 
  when they ca n't even write sentences that follow a sensible structure , it becomes very difficult to trust them . 
  but i have to say , the specific criticisms this article levels at gotham do ring true to me . 
  i 'm not sure i agree that their conclusion necessarily follows , but they bring up some good points . 
  at the very least , it 's better than anything the av club ever put out . 
  your company 's production line is running at 2 am ? 
  dst causes :, 
  * a spike in heart problems, 
  * a spike in traffic accidents, 
  * a spike in suicides, 
  * lower worker productivity, 
  * communications difficulties with other time zones, 
  on the positive side , it brings ... 
  * at the real time of 6 pm your clock says 7 pm, 
  basically , there is no rational argument in favour of it . 
  the dragonborn stuff starts getting heavier in the 3rd book i think , and then there 's a huge amount of it in the 5th ( which is set largely in the dragonborn city of djerad thymar ) . 
  when in gaming does it happen ? 
  the most i can think of is sprinting ( one key ) moving on a diagonal ( two keys ) , jumping ( one key ) and one other thing ( interacting , throwing a grenade , or whatever ; one key ) . 
  that 's the absolute * most * i can possibly think of doing , and it 's still got a buffer of 1 key before the usb maximum . 
  this looks perfectly good . 
  it comes across as mostly the same as existing races mechanically , just swapping out the core strong racial feature for a different one that 's more appropriate and really does a good job of fitting the flavour you 're after . 
  the at-will nature of ** bite ** * might * be too strong , but the fact that it 's single target unlike the dragonborn ( and does 1d6 less ) , and the way it 's worded means it is n't able to syngergise with features like sneak attack , extra attack , or divine smite makes me believe this is probably balanced just fine . 
  the restrained requirement also helps . 
  but for what it 's worth , dhampir have been shared here a great many times before . 
  you might want to take a look at some of them and see if you like any of them . 
  [ here 's one by coolgamertagbro ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3t630z/dhampir _ race_three_subraces / ) , a frequent submitter of pretty good content . 
  it 's probably the best thing we 've seen that 's explicitly called a `` dhampir '' . 
  [ here is another more recent dhampir submission ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 548vuf/the _ dhampir_revamped / ) . 
  but related , [ here is something someone submitted that they called a vampire race ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 472w9e/vampires _ as_a_race_and_not_a_class / ) . 
  and [ here is a vryloka race ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) replete with strong flavour text and art , based on the vryloka from past editions of d&d 's `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  they 're a vampire-like race with a strong individual lore associated with them that sets them apart from your generic ` half-vampire ' , while mechanically playing quite similarly . 
  made by yours truly . 
  [ ( available as a pdf here .

   the rules for turning a magic weapon into a pact weapon do n't explicitly remove this restriction . 
  they do n't need to . 
  the wording makes it clear that it is an alternative option entirely . 
  perhaps more pertinent , though , is that [ there has been an official clarification on the matter ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/rules-answers-april-2016 ) . 
  yes , you can choose a ranged weapon if you are bonding a magical weapon . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/daylight-savings-time-bad-health-effects-sleep-2016-3/?r=au&amp;ir=t ) . 
  plenty more out there with a basic google search . 
  when would this be ? 
  the way weapons work in dark cloud is one of the most interesting things about it . 
  weapons can break from over use if you do n't repair them . 
  if you treat them well though , in dark cloud it is the * weapons * that gain experience and level up , not the player . 
  you can put attachments on them like elemental affinities or damage increases . 
  these are temporary attachments , but if they are attached when the weapon levels up , they become permanent , and the attachment slots are freed up to attach more . 
  at a certain point , you can choose to deliberately break your weapon to take a percentage of its attributes and be able to place them on a new weapon . 
  each of the main characters uses a different type of weapon . 
  the primary protagonist uses swords , the next character uses slingshots , etc. 
  i 've never played dark chronicle either , but from what i 've heard it has no real relation to the first game in terms of story . 
  i should really go back and finish the first game though . 
  as a kid i was never able to beat the dark genie despite getting up to that point in multiple play-throughs ... 
  as a general rule , yes anything shared here is fair game . 
  that 's why people share stuff here !, 
  it might also be polite of you to reach out and specifically contact the people whose content you 're using . 
  not so much to obtain permission as to just let them know , because they may be interested to know where their stuff is getting used . 
  since you 've got an answer , and this post is technically in violation of the subreddit 's submission rules ( that submissions must be content that can actually be used ) , i am removing this post . 
  sure , but with the scag , if you * do n't * use the lore , you 're paying for a book of which you use something like 10 % of the total content . 
  volo 's is better , but if you do n't use the lore that 's still a substantial amount of wasted stuff . 
  if you 're a person who wants to entirely create your own lore ( which , personally , i am not . 
  i enjoy the included lore primarily as inspiration for my own , even if i do n't use it all myself . 
  it 's just that i can understand where people like matt are coming from . 
  ) , it 's very understandable that you would be annoyed at the direction wizards is heading . 
  simply saying `` oh , you do n't have to use the lore that 's there '' is a complete cop-out , because you 're paying for it either way , if you want the crunch . 
   to be fair , it was advertised as a book containing lore . 
  so if you bought it but do n't like the lore , you 're getting exactly what you were promised . 
  if the only books they 're releasing are in that format , you do n't have much option . 
  you still have * every * right to complain about it because you 're being affected by their choice : pay heaps for a book you only use a fraction of , or do n't get any of the new stuff . 
  i do n't really think there was anything wrong with the powers system in 4e . 
  it 's the equivalent of wizards , sorcerers , et al. 
  getting to choose from their massive lists of spells , or fighters , paladins , etc. 
  having their fighting styles . 
  the difference being that in 4e fighters had just as much choice as wizards , instead of being limited to only a tiny handful . 
  yeah , mystic is what they 're calling the class previous editions referred to as the psion . 
  they 've already released two previous versions of it in ua articles . 
  the first was only 5 levels , and the second got up to level 10 ( as well as making some changes to the first 5 levels ) . 
  we 've been anticipating a full 20 level version for some time now .
