  marking is one of the coolest things from 4e that i miss in 5e , and i quite like the way it 's being reintroduced . 
  hopefully this will also be accompanied by seasons 1 and 2 being available on netflix for those of us outside the us . 
  nah man , i got what you were going for there . 
  and according to the people * who actually get to make that determination * , neither has hillary . 
  honestly i woulda done the opposite . 
  speed up and try to race through * before * the train . 
  if you 've only got one function , why do you need * any * global variables ? 
  this also works for screen brightness , except unfortunately 1 full bar is the lowest it actually goes . 
  increasing in steps of a quarter works , but decreasing below 1 says the same until 0 . 
  because there is none , because voting third party in a country stuck with fptp is an objectively had decision . 
  i do n't know how it does things , but a hash of the file would be the ` correct ' way to detect duplicates . 
  file size will not always work , for example changing a simple typo like a comma that should be a full stop will not change file size . 
  it also wo n't download on a metered wifi connection , so tell it that your home network is one ( even if it is n't ) and you should be okay . 
  i do n't see anything that indicates that is what they meant . 
  they quite clearly say `` when you drag and drop a ** file ** '' . 
  ` blame ' does n't seem an entirely fair word to use here . 
  it 's a much better design . 
  mine work fine . 
  a-jays 5 . 
  this is ( one of the reasons ) why you should only swim at patrolled beaches , where the life savers are trained to recognise this kind of thing . 
  also , do n't put floaties on kids ' legs . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  plus one for copping to it though . 
  also , 3 ! = 6 . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is for sharing usable homebrew material . 
  it does n't need to be perfectly refined , but it does need to be in a state that someone can take and use . 
  this does not seem to be in that state , so i am removing it . 
  you might want to try [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5bm178/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) instead , which is a place for sharing incomplete ideas .

  trump 's victory is on * everyone * in america who did not vote clinton . 
  that * absolutely * includes people stupid enough to throw away their vote by voting for a third party . 
  like it or not , you guys are stuck with a first past the past voting system . 
  if you do n't vote accordingly , you have made a stupid mistake . 
  what you choose to accept has no bearing on the reality of your country 's voting system . 
  i 'm not american . 
  i thought `` your country '' and `` you guys '' made that quite clear . 
  i vote green every election . 
  but i live somewhere that that * does n't * make the worst candidate more likely to win . 
  but the fact that you did n't notice the obvious hints as to my nationality ( or rather -- my lack of an american one ) says quite a bit about your reading comprehension capabilities , which in turn says something interesting about your inability to cast a rational ballot . 
   the retarded 4-hour voting lines those guys seem to have, 
  seriously it 's crazy . 
  i had to wait like 3 minutes once and i thought that was a long line . 
  seeing the images of some american polling places is * insane * . 
  to be honest i agree with you . 
  i had never heard the term before our latest federal election , and i 'm not a fan . 
  it * does * sound like the sort of thing americans would come up with . 
  so , we gon na take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week ? 
  some of the most populated and democratic-leaning states are the ones with the least counted votes . 
  they 're already counted as d on the ec , but their popular vote is n't being registered yet . 
  that depends on what you mean by worse . 
  he 's been extremely against free trade in general ( despite overwhelming economic opinion being that it 's broadly a good thing ) , so someone against the tpp because of economic reasons will probably be happy . 
  i do n't know that he 's had much to say either way about other aspects of the tpp like the ip stuff or the isdses . 
  if you like civ 2 , i 'm sure civ 3 or 4 will work fine as well . 
  honestly i 'd be surprised if civ v could n't work even . 
  it 's not a super demanding game . 
  well he 's already made it quite clear that in general he 's very isolationist , and in particular he strongly dislikes china and has no respect for nato . 
  he seems to be okay with russia meddling in us domestic affairs though , at least when it 's favourable to him . 
  though trump himself has had little to say about australia that i 'm aware of , the abc was claiming that his campaign has said that he supports the current relationship between the two countries . 
  the thing is , civ v is not a very * graphics * intensive game . 
  it 's mostly hard on the processor . 
  and even a mediocre computer from 2016 is going to compete quite well against some higher end ( but not top-end ) computers from 6 years ago . 
  which is better , a 2.4 ghz core 2 duo or a 1.1 ghz ( boost up to 2.2 ghz ) skylake core m3 ? 
  i do n't know , but i think either is probably going to run civ v just fine , at least if the graphical settings are turned down . 
  ( and personally , i tend to run it on fairly low graphical settings even on my 2012 mbp , just because waiting to show the animations is much slower than just immediately getting to the next round . 
  it 's a better option for * aesthetics * even if your computer can handle them just fine . ), 
  the 2016 mb 's ssd is probably going to be a boon over the 2010 pro 's hdd , too . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  thanks . 
  hey , you should share this on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  it 's a really useful resource that would go well there . 
  your sentence was a little ambiguous , to be fair . 
  it could be blocked as `` 5 ( civilian drone ) fatalities '' , which is apparently what you intended . 
  but it could also be `` 5 civilian ( drone fatalities ) '' . 
  both are equally `` correct '' interpretations of what the above comment said . 
  people love to hate on php for some reason . 
  that 's literally all there is to that joke . 
  is this for their state elections only , or federal senators and representatives too ? 
  presumably this ca n't be changing the way their * presidential * electoral college votes will go in the future , can it ? 
  yup . 
  even if they * only * had icbm 's in moscow , 16,000 km can reach literally every even remotely significant landmass except new zealand and parts of antarctica . 
  from other parts of the country they can reach there . 
  ( also til : moscow is * really * conveniently located in an age of icbms , because its antipode is bang in the middle of the southern pacific ocean , meaning it 's within range of literally the most places it could possibly be . ), 
  nah it really is . 
  further north , or most of sea and you get 12 months of blistering heat and humidity . 
  europe and the us , even at their best , get way too cold in winter , as do parts of australia further south . 
  brisbane 's a * little * too cold in winter , but it 's pretty damn close to fuckin ' perfect weather . 
  i 'll admit i was too lazy to check the first time round , but since you answered i took a look myself . 
   the voting style will apply to races for u.s. senate , u.s. representative , governor , state senate and state representative . 
  so it looks like this will be for every state election and the federal congress representatives , but not president ( which would likely be infeasible to do unilaterally ) . 
  no , sometimes you just be a complete dick to strangers for no reason . 
  totally uncalled for man . 
  maybe it 's just because i come from a country that uses the westminster system of government , but i actually do n't entirely see the problem with the electoral college in this way . 
  in my country it 's entirely possible for the party that forms government to do so with a minority of the popular vote -- even after you account for the fact that we have irv .
