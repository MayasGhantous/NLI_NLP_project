  you just have to accept that you are n't voting directly for your leader ( us the prime minister , americans the president ) . 
  you 're voting for a representative who will end up choosing the leader . 
  the us has the unique quirk that the people who are being elected by the people are essentially nameless and have no function in the process of running the country after choosing the president , but other than that it 's a reasonable system . 
  the real problems that need to be fixed are voter disenfranchisement/suppression/low turnout rates , fptp , and congress vote gerrymandering . 
  the electoral college is a minor issue at best . 
  gerrymandering does n't work on presidential elections because each * state * is counted as a whole \\* . 
  it 's a big problem for house elections , but at state elections it does n't really even make sense as a concept . 
  \\* with the obvious exceptions of maine and nebraska . 
  hmm yeah that 's a good point actually . 
  maybe they could . 
  though perhaps there are federal rules that prevent them ? 
  otherwise , why would n't this have included that ? 
  just because it 's politically easier to get the yes vote if they exclude the president ? 
  res has a filter feature which will prevent you from seeing anything from there . 
  just hover over their name ( / r/the _ donald ) and hit the '' + filter '' button at the bottom . 
  hey !, 
  do n't you dare taint a fine and noble musical instrument with that brush !, 
  if you 're interested , / r/minorkey is a thing . 
  if you 're after sheet music , i 've got two different musicxml versions of it . 
  one for choir , one for saxophone quartet . 
  they 're fairly easy to arrange for piano . 
  i actually did it myself a few hours ago , before throwing them out without saving because i got bored of the idea . 
  and it looks like sibelius does n't start auto-saving until you 've manually saved once . 
  here are links to those pieces ( not on piano ) on musescore :,

  if anyone else wants to do something with them . 
  next week : ireland bans hot stoppers and switches back to fptp voting . 
  the way the abc coverage was telling it , we can blame ohio , pennsylvania , and wisconsin . 
  florida , you expect to be swingy , those other ones are traditional democratic strongholds that for some reason decided to go full retard this time around . 
  edit : probably best to clarify ( since i do n't know whether or not the american abc does news/election reporting ) i mean the australian broadcasting corporation was telling it that way . 
  sassy , or depressed ? 
  yeah my point is that that can happen quite easily even under better systems . 
  in the westminster system , the pm is ( in effect ) the guy who got just over 50 % of the votes in just over 50 % of the seats . 
  you could in theory have a pm with just barely over 25 % of the popular vote , while the other major contender got just under 75 % . 
  it 's certainly not a * good * thing ( and is why proportional systems like stv or mmp are even better ) , but imo compared to all the other problems with america 's electoral system , the electoral college is an extremely minor one . 
  they 've been hinting a big rules expansion ? 
  i 'm both intrigued and anxious about that ... 
  you would n't even need something as fancy as stv to do away with the `` 3rd parties are a wasted vote '' thing . 
  just the literal least they could do and switching to irv would be a massive improvement . 
  i have to say though , as an aussie i 'm more than a little jealous of your lower house election method . 
  stv is my preferred choice , and while we 've got it in our senate , it 's not quite as impactful . 
  though on the other hand , your upper house looks like an absolute clusterfuck of a method to elect things . 
  better than the house of lords across the way , but still bizarre . 
  also not a fan of direct election of head of state , though when it 's largely ceremonial as i 'm lead to believe it is in ireland , it 's not * quite * as bad as what the us has . 
  but again , compared to the glorious lower house thing you guys got going on , that 's a minor inconvenience . 
   voting for the president of ireland is irv rather than just fptp, 
  well of course , that goes without saying :p, 
  that 's interesting , but to be honest it sounds to me more like a ` problem ' with voters than with voting systems . 
  we 've got similar problems in australia , and america has made it * abundantly * clear that they do as well . 
  out of interest , what does `` college '' mean to the irish ? 
  in australia and the uk ( by my understanding ) it 's basically either the last couple of years of high school , or a residence at university ( think `` king 's college cambridge '' ) . 
  in the us it 's basically * synonymous * with `` university '' . 
  it does n't sound like that 's what you mean here , though i could be wrong . 
  i 've always been fascinated at how many different meanings the word has . 
  ah interesting . 
  is there a substantial quality of education difference , or is it all about the quality of paper the degree gets printed on ( so to speak ) ? 
  i just want to make clear i 'm not actually * defending * the ec , just saying that it 's not such a big deal . 
  even if you accept the premise of the argument you 're making ( which personally , i ** do not ** , states should , as far as i 'm concerned , have very little power or relevance relative to the federal government ) , it does n't actually hold up in practice . 
  [ if you remember grey 's original video on the topic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wc42hgla4k ) it points out quite clearly that the smaller states * do n't * get significantly protected in practice by the ec . 
  i got here from a * google now * link . 
  this post got * seriously * popular . 
  please tell me the episode is on today . 
  after yesterday i do n't know if i can take more disappointment . 
  ( though hearing young justice will be coming back was certainly fantastic news . ), 
  i figured that would be the case . 
  just did n't want to be more definitive in my claim without knowing 100 % . 
  voter * fraud * is and continues to be an imaginary boogeyman . 
  it happens in numbers so small that even the closest of races would not be swung by it . 
  voter * suppression * is a very real , but different , issue . 
  that 's where , for any number of reasons , people are prevented from getting to the polls to cast their vote . 
  ironically , voter fraud is often used as an excuse for it , for example voter id laws which disenfranchise people of lower incomes supposedly in an attempt to prevent fraud . 
  honestly ? 
  that 's an irrelevant question . 
  the united states already exists , and just because something was a good idea 200 or whatever years ago , does n't mean it is today . 
  range voting is * terrible * . 
  it devolves * immediately * to approval voting , except that an uninformed voter might have their vote count for less by not strategically voting . 
  the fact that one can express a preference puts irv ahead of approval in my books , but * anything * other than fptp is better than the horror that is range voting . 
   i think it was cpg gray [ sic ] as well who made a video about it, 
  you are aware that the thread we are currently on is * about * an updated version of exactly that video , right ? 
  [ here 's the original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wc42hgla4k ) . 
  it 's only open to strategic voting if you 're talking about a `` lesser of two evils '' choice . 
  if you , for example , technically approve of both trump and clinton in mostly equal portions ( either a lot to both , or very very little to both ) , but definitely know who of the two you would prefer . 
  an honest approval vote would see you either ticking both of them , or neither of them . 
  but you need to strategically vote to get one ahead . 
  the thing is though , in practical elections , it 's an unlikely scenario ; it requires you know ahead of time who the big players are going to be ( something that can become more difficult in countries that see more significant growth of third parties ) and that you approve of * both * or * neither * . 
  i still think that being able to explicitly express * preference * is an important feature , which is why my favourite single-winner system is irv ( though proportional systems beat single-winner any day -- and * necessarily * single-winner elections like presidencies are a redundancy in well-built democracies ) . 
  but i do n't think the specific issue with approval voting that you raised is a relevant one . 
  nope . 
  all i care about are the facts . 
  here are a handful of sources ( the first four being reliable unbiased ones , the latter ones arguably having some bias ) for you . 
  if you refuse to accept facts , that 's on you mate .

  man i love hearing the various rules different countries come up with for constitutional changes to be effected . 
  they 're fascinating .
