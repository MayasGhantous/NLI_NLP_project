  in the us they require a 2/3 vote in the federal congress ( of those present ; both houses separately must meet this requirement ) , and * then * it goes to the states , where three quarters of them must approve it . 
  in australia , where i 'm from , it requires an absolute majority ( i.e. , half +1 of all elected people , even if they 're not in the room ) of both the house of representatives and the senate , separately . 
  then , it goes to the people and the states . 
  to pass , it must achieve a majority of people around the nation * and * a majority of people in a majority of states . 
  a so-called `` double-majority '' . 
  that 's true , but greens favour clinton . 
   i just understand the point of fptp, 
  first past the post and the electoral college are two not technically related ideas . 
  fptp is * completely * *** indefensible *** . 
  it is an absolutely abhorrent blight on democracy . 
  there are some ( very , * very * weak , in my opinion , but they do exist nonetheless and can be debated reasonably ) reasons to defend the electoral college . 
  there are ** none ** for fptp . 
  none beyond ignorance and fear-mongering , at least . 
  the ec could exist even with other voting systems . 
  irv would work , as would stv . 
  indeed , the ec seems * perfectly * designed to be a state-by-state stv election . 
  i do n't know where you were looking , but i 've seen criticism of the ec on an occasional basis since around the time grey put out his * first * video on the topic 5 years ago , and i 've seen it come up very frequently over the past two weeks or so . 
  kind of . 
  stv is a multi-winner system where you select some n winners based on all the voters ' numbered preferences . 
  when n = 1 it devolves into irv . 
  but you do n't typically talk about stv in a single-winner system because it makes things unclear . 
  that was my point . 
   its pretty much all great, 
  someone obviously was n't around for the first two articles :p, 
  there are quite a few other less great ones though . 
  modern stuff , the `` variant rules '' , their first overhaul of the ranger ( with ambuscade ) . 
  probably more , but i ca n't remember all of them . 
  certainly though , a lot of great stuff has been in ua . 
  hear , hear . 
  just so you know , if you 're writing in prose like this , you do n't have to use the greentext syntax if you do n't want to . 
  ffs . 
  when will dms realise that * they do n't know better than wizards of the coast and the hundreds of playtesters for the game * and stop fucking nerfing players just because they do n't understand how it fucking works, 
  another popular go-to has been star-spangled banner transposed into a minor key . 
  true , good point !, 
  just a friendly reminder to people that if you 're looking for actual * good quality * stuff , head over to / r/unearthedarcana and / r/boh5e . 
  singular has also made [ a traders and merchants expansion ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4y2jxb/wh _ strongholds_traders_merchants_finally_vendors / ) to the base ruleset in that link . 
  this . 
  rolling for stats is great fun that can create some fantastic variety in characters that you 'll never get out of point buy . 
  but it needs some limits . 
  characters that are too weak or too strong should be rerolled or they 'll be unfun for either the player , or all the other players . 
   if their net modifier is negative, 
  i 'm even more lenient . 
  net modifiers before racials of between +2 and +5 are acceptable , barring exceptional circumstances . 
  you would be wrong . 
  the rules are very explicit : you ca n't stack proficiency from multiple sources . 
  it 's probably the single most-used skill in my group , except perhaps persuasion and deception . 
  it 's the key difference , and also the huge reason that approval voting for elections is a bad idea . 
  it 's a poor design decision , not a poor implementation of that design . 
  the way approval voting works with honest voters is you vote for every candidate you approve of . 
  anything else means you are not voting honestly , but instead strategically . 
  if there are 4 candidates , green , democrat , republican , and libertarian , and i only * truly * like the green candidate , the only * honest * vote is to vote green and no one else . 
  but , knowing that the democrats are a more moderate party with a higher chance of winning , and really * despising * the republicans , i 'm a smart voter , so i also tick democrat . 
  that was a dishonest , strategic vote . 
  yes , it means i did n't have to * not * vote green , which is great !, 
  but it also means that the voting system has failed to accurately represent my vote . 
  a vote for democrats and greens because i truly support both is represented no differently than a vote for the greens and democrats because i like the greens but know the democrats need to win to stop the republicans . 
  with preferential voting , i can truly make the distinction . 
  i can say `` i really like the greens , but if they do n't win , then the democrats are the next best option '' . 
  i can vote in a truly honest way and * still * get my desire to prevent a republican win to have increased likelihood . 
  yes it is . 
  it 's just proving more work than expected . 
  from the ad and the name i thought this would be about unfucking-up the dc cinematic universe . 
  it feels *** so *** good . 
  the place will probably quiet downs after a few days though . 
  i do n't think we have any official release date announced , but it 'll probably be a long time before the show gets to air again , and there wo n't be much to talk about until then . 
  what crazy people are saying it 's 18 \u00b0 is n't cold ? 
  you can also long press on a hyphen to get en or em dashes ( -- or -- ) , and on the full stop ( only on the symbols keyboard , not when the full stop is below the alphabet , unfortunately ) to get ellipsis ( ... ) . 
   what crazy ** people **, 
  regardless of the merits ( or , in this case , lack thereof ) of the criticism , it is ** not ** a requirement that someone be able to `` do better '' in order to provide criticism of someone else 's work . 
  it never has been , and that 's just not how criticism as a concept works . 
  not in film , not in literature , and not in photography . 
  right wrist , because i 'm not some abomination !, 
  watches go on the non-dominant hand . 
  i mean , sure , casting eb a lot is n't the * most * fun thing in the world , but you 're a warlock for the gods ' sake !, 
  they 're one of the most innately roleplay-rich classes there are !, 
  why did you form your pact ? 
  who was it with ? 
  what do they want out of it ? 
  what 's your relation with your patron like on a personal level ( cordial , businesslike , adversarial , etc. ) ? 
  what do the other players in your party think about this deal ( if they know of it at all ) ? 
  there 's * so much * that can grow out of a warlock 's pact . 
  besides , eb is no worse than a fighter 's `` i hit it with my sharp stick '' every turn . 
  and you 've still got two spells per short rest for fun times , and a few other cantrips to choose . 
  yeah i really feel like it 's incumbent on a dm to make sure that there 's a real cost to being a warlock . 
  even more so if it 's used as a multiclass . 
  not only does that cut down on dipping cheese , but that 's where most of the fun of the class comes from !, 
  ca n't run final cut pro on windows . 
  and while i have n't got it working on my ( windows ) desktop yet * at all * , i suspect that the recent bash inclusion in windows 10 is nowhere near as nice as being on an actual unix-like operating system . 
  mate that 's unaustralian . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ very ^ ^ ^ least ^ ^ ^ unqueenslandian, 
  pls . 
  we all know vita-brits are the superior cereal . 
  there are a bunch of earlier ones in there that i 've never heard of . 
  what 's an erector set , or a tinker toy , or lincoln logs ? 
  ( though from the name , i 'm guessing lincoln logs might 've been a particularly american toy ? ), 
  i 've never heard of raggedy ann or andy , but certainly that type of generic `` doll '' deserves to be in the list . 
  i do n't think they deserve individual separate places , though . 
  the game of life is a * really * weird choice imo , since it 's not really a `` game '' so much as just a vaguely interesting experiment in emergent properties . 
  when is the crossover ? 
  next week ?
