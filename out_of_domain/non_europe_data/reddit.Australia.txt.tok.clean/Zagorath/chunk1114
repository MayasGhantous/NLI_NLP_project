  oh i do n't watch trailers for spoiler reasons . 
  thanks . 
  so is [ insert political opinion here ] . 
  yeah i clicked on the links for the ones i did n't recognise . 
  there were a couple i did n't know by name but recognised when i saw the picture ( like `` radio flyer wagon '' ) and left out of the above comment . 
  those three look completely foreign to me . 
  oh right . 
  i 've never heard of that board game before . 
  i was thinking of [ john conway 's game of life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conway%27s_game_of_life ) . 
  it seems a bit unfortunate that it 's so america-centric . 
  it would be much better if the toys selected were ones that are iconic around the world -- and gods know there exist enough of those to fill out such a hof . 
  but it 's not enormously surprising in this kind of list . 
  i love this . 
  it reads so much like a trump speech . 
  the actual points it makes could be summarised in like two or three quick sentences , but it goes on and on repeating the same points . 
  i do n't know about computer science , but infs3202 is on the software engineering course list and it is mostly php . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  umm ... i 'm removing this comment . 
  in the future , could you use a more appropriate link when providing examples of how to do things ? 
  they 're trademarks , not copyrighted . 
   i 'm not 100 % sure they teach php . 
  things may have changed , but when i did it a few years ago they definitely did not . 
  it was all front end stuff . 
  the eu ( and also some of the specific countries within it -- especially germany ) is fucking moronic when it comes to technology . 
  they absolutely despise any company that dares to be successful in the tech industry , especially american companies . 
  they force websites to clutter themselves up with ugly banners , they force search engines to censor perfectly valid and accurate information , germany forced google to implement a whole new system allowing them to censor street view ( photos taken from a public location of publicly visible objects ) . 
  it goes on . 
  fuck the eu . 
  at least when it comes to technology . 
  what cog menu ? 
  hovering over it , the only button is a share button . 
  yeah i 'm asking if it 's possible to change it as a user . 
  i can suppress @here and @everyone for the whole server on a personal level , but i want to suppress them only for a single channel . 
  awesome , cheers . 
  you will need to make the document viewable by anyone with the link , at the moment no one can see it . 
  hit the `` share '' button in the top right , then in the top right of the pop-up that appears , hit `` get shareable link '' . 
  paste that link into your submission . 
  i think it 's important to start out by noting that combat in d&d is not realistic . 
  the advantages of using a weapon in two hands are already represented by the weapon 's higher damage die . 
  remember , hp is an abstraction and does * not * only mean `` how deep did the sword penetrate '' or something like that . 
  it also means `` how off balance was i put by an unexpectedly difficult parry '' , `` how well focussed on the battle am i '' , `` how much luck do i have '' , and much more . 
  when the weapon does more damage , that could be simply that you were faster and more accurate , and so your target was more threatened and had to suddenly leap out of the way , or overexert themselves to get their blade in the way to parry in time . 
  you 're absolutely right not to add the ac thing . 
  that would make it almost equivalent to the dual wielder feat , balance-wise , and fighting styles should have a much lesser impact than feats . 
  anyway , about this fighting style as it exists right now . 
  there are two significant impacts i can see something like this having . 
  the first is if someone multiclasses rogue . 
  they would then get to do 1d10 with sneak attack where previously they had the ability to do 1d8 , or have two attempts at 1d6 . 
  it 's a bit of a buff , but not an enormous one . 
  the second is that it makes dex fighters * way * more potent . 
  dex is already the master stat , being a source of ac , initiative , a major saving throw , some fairly useful skills , and a possible source of damage . 
  but most fighters want their strength to be good too , since strength has much better options for doing damage . 
  allowing them to * only * focus on dex means that they can ( a ) get their con up much more , earlier , buffing their health more than normal , or ( b ) get more feats than they otherwise would , without sacrificing damage or defensive output . 
  overall , this feels too strong to me . 
  but i 'm not completely sure . 
  i 'd be open to hearing what others have to say about it . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  ouch :(, 
  i * think * that this is at least partly based on user votes . 
  monopoly is * extremely * unpopular with the sorts of people who would vote in online polls ( the same sorts of people who * are * more likely to like rpgs , to some extent ) , so that could explain its absence . 
  cluedo is certainly a weird thing to not have there . 
  i 'm not super surprised that go is missing , since it 's apparently an american list . 
  pictionary , trivial pursuit , charades ( though this one might not come as an actual physical `` toy '' ? ), 
  and where 's wally are a couple of others that strike me as obviously missing . 
  but maybe those are n't as popular in the states . 
  but i definitely agree that their granularity is really quite off . 
  in addition to the dolls , mentioning a * specific * yo-yo brand and crayon brand is another weird little thing . 
  meanwhile , they 're generic about hula hoops , kites , dollhouses , and most of the other things . 
   most of the other feats that grant a bonus like this also give a seconday ( in fact the unearth arcana one gives +1 ac ) so i think having it also give +1 ac would be fine ( as long as you do n't have that stack with other feat bonuses to ac ) . 
  careful now !, 
  this is n't a feat , it 's a * fighting style * . 
  oh man , the lack of an ability to play back at 1.5 or 2 times speed on facebook is * maddening * . 
  this video is * so * low on information density ... 
  canz ~ ~ us ~ ~ might be willing to help . 
  california is , after all , one of the least crazy parts of the us . 
  the only thing that 'd be stopping them from helping is fear of retaliation from the us itself . 
  that 's a pretty big `` only thing '' though , so yeah . 
  also canz are hardly massive military powers . 
  so there 's that too . 
  the fact that maine has a system that allows its electoral college votes to not be a winner-takes-all system might work in the way you describe . 
  but the fact that it now uses irv probably wo n't . 
  in fact , it 's just the opposite , because it means their local representatives are able to face more viable competition , since third parties are no longer spoilers , even traditionally `` safe '' seats might become battlegrounds between the major safe party and independents/minor parties . 
  it 's a bit like seats like [ melbourne ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/melb/ ) and [ batman ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/batm/ ) \\* in australia , where the labor party was traditionally safe , but in recent elections it 's become a serious battle between labor and the greens . 
  the traditional `` major parties '' in australia are labor ( moderately progressive ) and the liberal/national coalition ( conservative ) . 
  the greens ( very progressive ) are able to successfully challenge in some seats thanks to irv . 
  even if we did n't have it nation-wide , those seats could still benefit . 
  \\* yes , it 's called batman . 
  pronounced with a short `` a '' though . 
  / \u0259 / in ipa , i * think *, 
  no i understand that . 
  but for federal senate and house races , it can work exactly the same way . 
  it would even work if they decided to apply it to presidential races . 
  that 's something that they can do because -- and * only * because -- of the abstraction the electoral college provides ; if the electoral college were removed in favour of direct/popular vote , the only way to do irv for the president would be if it were implemented nation-wide . 
  in fact , that * might * be why they decided it * wo n't * apply to presidential races . 
  ( the other reason i can think of is that more people would have been more likely to vote no on the proposition . ), 
   the issue is dead and no one will touch it, 
  thank fuck for that , too . 
  daylight saving is an abomination . 
  i fucking love these .
