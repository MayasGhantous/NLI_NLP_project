  they 're so good . 
  i 've definitely taken some of his advice into consideration in my own playing , especially with regard to [ tempo in the 1st movement of piano sonata no. 14 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80zmsda5q8q ) . 
  i take his pedalling suggestions into account too when i can , but most of the time i 'm on a digital piano where half pedalling is n't an option . 
  my local symphony orchestra often has the conductor give a talk about the repertoire to people who show up an hour or so before the concert starts . 
  if yours does something similar , i would * highly * recommend attending , because they can be really interesting . 
  not just about the pieces themselves , but you can learn about that specific recording 's choice of interpretation and why they did it how they did . 
   just was n't controversial, 
  obviously was at least a bit , since it only passed 52 -- 48 . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) explains it perfectly . 
  note that it could * only * be used for legislative bodies like the house of representatives . 
  indeed , cleese is describing what his party wanted to be implemented in the british house of commons ( which is the equivalent of america 's reps ) . 
  there are other systems that could be used . 
  cleese is describing [ stv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8xozjkozfi ) , but the other major one that 's not terrible is [ mmp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu ) . 
  stv is one * type * of proportional representation . 
  `` pr '' is just a * trait * that some voting systems have . 
  stv and mmp are the two most widely used pr systems . 
  australia uses irv in all federal house of representatives elections , and most of our state and local elections too . 
  we just do n't have write-ins . 
  but in theory , they could work exactly as they already do . 
  you can write a name in , put a number next to it , and it 'll be passed through the irv algorithm as normal . 
   with approval voting , the way to vote strategically is to only approve of your favorite candidate, 
  not quite . 
  you vote for your favourite candidate , * and * your least hated candidate that 's likely to win . 
  if you were a progressive in the 2000 presidential election for example , you would vote nader and gore . 
  even if you do n't * actually * like gore at all , you strategically vote for him anyway because you * really * do n't want bush to win . 
  it 's still strategic voting , but it never devolves to something as bad as fptp . 
  that 's called `` range voting '' and imo it 's a * terrible * idea . 
  it ends up devolving to approval voting ( a voting system where you say `` yes '' or `` no '' to every candidate ) because even if you do n't totally agree with them , you want your least hated candidate out of the major parties to win . 
   ranked choice is confusing , can cause ballot spoilage, 
  [ this is demonstrably false . 
  ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/informal_voting/summary.htm ) spoilt ballot rates in australia are incredibly low despite * everyone * being * required * to go to the polls ( which you would think would make spoilt ballot rates really high , by people who just do n't care to actually take the time to cast a proper ballot ) . 
  remember , this data includes both accidental and deliberate ballot spoilage . 
   and assumes that people do n't ever like two candidates equally, 
  true , and that 's a bit of a problem . 
  much worse , though , is the fact that with approval voting you have * no way * to express a preference . 
  if you * really * like the greens , and * hate * the democrats , but you ** really ** hate the republicans ( so you say on your ballot that you `` approve '' of the dems just to stop the repubs ) , that looks exactly the same as someone who actually likes dem and does n't mind grn . 
  no way to say `` this is my favourite '' . 
  if my honest opinion is :, 
  * green : 8, 
  * democrat : 5, 
  * republican : 3, 
  what do i gain from actually voting that way ? 
  i really want greens to win -- or at least do the best they possibly can because they 're by far my favourites -- so even though i do n't actually think of them as 10/10 , i put them as 10 . 
  i do n't like the democrats much , but i * really * do n't want the republicans to win , and i know that dem and rep are most likely to win . 
  so to increase the chance of dems beating rep , i put them at 10 and 1 , respectively . 
  i really , * really * hate libertarian economics , but they 've got some decent social policies even if they sometimes take them too far . 
  so i honestly think of them as 2/10 , but because of how much i do n't want them to have any chance of actually getting into power , i strategically vote them 1 . 
  a smart voter will , in range voting , only ever vote the minimum amount or the maximum amount for any candidate . 
  this makes it equivalent to approval voting ( where everyone gets `` yes '' or `` no '' ) . 
  but range voting is even worse than approval , because it can trap uneducated voters into voting honestly . 
  anyone who votes `` 8 '' for their favourite candidate essentially has their vote with 4/5s what my vote is worth . 
   that breed of dog is uncommon in asia, 
  when i saw other users commenting saying, 
   this breed of dog is not popular, 
  i thought they were using `` popular '' in the idiomatic sense of `` well-liked '' . 
  as in , saying that this is a breed of dog people do n't like ( implying they mistrust or are scared of it ) . 
  now that you 've pointed out they might have just meant it 's not very common , that makes a * lot * more sense to me . 
   somewhere in asia, 
  the language sounds to me like it * might * be vietnamese . 
  ( incidentally `` m\u00e8o '' , pronounced like english `` meow '' , means `` cat '' in vietnamese . ), 
  but the writing on the building looks like khmer . 
  so my best guess is somewhere near the border between vietnam and cambodia , possibly in a khmer minority village in vietnam , or a viet minority village in cambodia . 
   i really should have said 0-10 , though . 
  do n't know why i put it at 1-10 . 
  the exact numbers really make no difference . 
  you could make it an 8 -- 43 system and the effects would end up the same . 
  this is a mathematical truth , regardless of whether or not my points about strategic voting are correct . 
  the only thing that * does * make a difference is the size of the range , but only insofar as that allows me to express more minor differences . 
   if you do n't think of someone as a 10 , do n't put them as a 10 . 
  if they do n't have your full support , why act like they do ? 
  because even though i do n't like them , i ** really ** do n't like the other guys and i ** really ** do n't want the others guys to win . 
  it 's like with fptp . 
  you could say `` if you do n't like the democrats , why do you vote for them ? '', 
  the answer is because a vote for the greens is wasted , so i strategically cast my vote in such a way as it can have the most effect . 
  in range voting , that means always giving either the minimum or the maximum amount . 
  small scale simulations and/or elections where the results are of low significance are bound to behave differently because the consequences of them not getting the result they wanted do n't matter as much . 
  if you 're a nader supporter in 2000 , and you honestly think of gore as about a 5 or 6/10 , you probably * really * do n't want bush to win . 
  if you do n't give gore a 10 , you 're not doing the maximum amount you can to let bush win . 
  the consequences of that are far more serious to you than which restaurant you and your buddies eat at , or whatever other thing you vote on in small scale , so if you 're smart you vote strategically . 
  but again , this will * punish * people who * do n't * vote strategically , because those who do end up having their vote worth more . 
  imagine this extreme . 
  50 % of people are republican supporters and 50 % are democrat supporters . 
  both parties ' supporters equally support their own party , such that the average vote for each is 7.5 . 
  but the republicans all vote honestly , and the democrats all vote strategically . 
  the republicans ' final score is, 
  the democrats ' final score is, 
  the democrats * easily * win this election , despite the `` honest '' results being equal . 
   i still feel like this is better than the `` give 100 % of your support to one person '' system , because it at least allows you to say `` i like multiple people , and want them to win in this order '' . 
  in theory i agree . 
  i actually really do n't like approval voting at all . 
  if we could force everyone to vote honestly , ranked voting would be pretty great . 
  my preferred system ( for single-winner elections -- in general , proportional systems like stv and mmp are better ) is instant runoff voting . 
  you rank the candidates in the order you prefer them , numbering 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. 
  you ca n't express * degrees * of preference , but you can ( and * have to * ) express the * order * you prefer . 
  and because of the runoff system , in most cases strategic voting is impossible or difficult to accurately predict ( though in some edge cases strategic voting * can * be done ) . 
  i 'm not sure how familiar you are with irv , but [ here 's a video explaining it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y3je3b8hse ) . 
  it 's the system maine just implemented , and it 's what australia has used for most of its elections for decades . 
  if i suspect they 're not going to win anyway , because i 've seen which parties got the most representation in debates , media coverage , and which parties scored the best in opinion polls , i give my favourite candidate a vote to show support and to gain federal funding for reaching a minimum threshold . 
  but i vote for the major party that i least hate , because i do n't want the major party i most hate to win . 
  i suppose it * could * devolve to fptp if there are 3 or more candidates that are viewed as * equally * likely to win , but even then it would depend .
