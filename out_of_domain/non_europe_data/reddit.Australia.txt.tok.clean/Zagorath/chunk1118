  yeah do n't you just fucking hate that . 
  i 'm so sick of maccas and their bloody burgers !, 
  i wish there were existing blacklist-based adblockers that actually worked properly . 
  i 've tried using the blacklist functions in some existing ad blocking extensions , and they frankly just do not work at all . 
  it 's really annoying , because i believe blocking ads indiscriminately is morally wrong , but i want to block ads on sites that get overly obnoxious about it -- mainly autoplay video/audio ads on websites where the video is n't the main point of the site . 
  she was 13 when she arrived on earth , and she 's stated to have been here for 12 years . 
  like i said , i 've already tried existing options . 
  \u00b5block 's method is not only way too much of a kluge , i 've not found it to work reliably . 
  if it 's not netflix that ends up showing it , those of us outside the us are going to have no choice but to pirate it in order to watch , unless we want a week , month , or even half a year delay before we can watch . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  which brings us full circle back to the op . 
  clinton lost not because she convinced democrats to vote republican , but because she failed to convince democrats to vote at all . 
  when we have compulsory voting , that can not happen . 
   30 year old american here . 
  i 'm hijacking to say that you 're spot on . 
  however , 3rd party voters are constantly berated for throwing their vote away . 
  i always showed up and voted third party , and knew my candidate would n't get in . 
  the point was that i voted . 
  nope . 
  sorry , but in america a vote for a third party * is * a waste . 
  you might as well not have voted . 
  if you can get them to switch to a less shit voting system , then vote 3rd party all you like !, 
  but until then voting third party is helping the major party you dislike the most get into power . 
  it is objectively a bad decision . 
  it 's called the spoiler effect , and it 's a property that fptp suffers from and can not be avoided without changing voting systems . 
  and if you can honestly say you dislike them equally , then i feel really bad for you . 
  i 'd rate this as 5.75 on the fixed detect balance scale . 
  that makes it around the perfect level of balance . 
  nicely done . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  uh , just so you know , the previous responses are currently being made publicly visible . 
  you might want to turn that off . 
   we have a bunch of d&d content for you to playtest , discuss , and mull over . 
  we have enough material , in fact , that ** we will be releasing unearthed arcana multiple times a month for the next few months ** . ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/barbarian-primal-paths ), 
  emphasis mine . 
  so they have n't guaranteed every week , and nor have they specified precisely when they will stop . 
  [ this one here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) . 
  but i 've fixed it so that +1 asi is equal to +1 on the scale ( by dividing by 4 ) , just like the older [ musicus scale ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/edit ) , and like the detect balance scale was * originally * , before its creator annoyingly decided to arbitrarily change things . 
  yeah they 've kinda implied it will be weekly , but it looks like they 've given themselves an out in case they decide to take a week off here and there . 
  dude , spoilers ... 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana . 
  no , you get stuck with a binary choice because that is a natural inevitable consequence of the first past the post voting system . 
  because you 're only able to cast a vote for a single candidate , and the winner is simply the candidate who gets the * most * votes , rather than needing to actually obtain a * majority * , the only sane choice is to pool your votes with the candidate with whoever is most likely to win . 
  it 's not something that 's possible to avoid , and it means that voting for a third party is an objective mistake . 
  in australia , we do n't use fptp , we use instant runoff voting ( like maine will do from now on -- for all votes except the president ) for the house of representatives , and single transferable vote in the senate , so voting for minor parties is a viable option . 
   maybe things run differently in the state where you 're registered ? 
  our federal elections are also * run * federally by an independent body , so it does n't matter which state i 'm registered in . 
  it 's all the same . 
  it also means we do n't have the same sort of problems with gerrymandering or voters ' registrations being ` lost ' , and other problems like the us has with voter suppression . 
  the fact that individual states run the * federal * election for people in that state in america is just * bizarre * , frankly . 
  the breath weapon as it works for dragonborn is pretty much balanced equally to the spell progression , so you could offer a variant that loses the spellcasting progression and instead gains a dragonborn-like attack that does psychic damage on a failed int save . 
  it would , but i think that would be offset by the fact that the dragonborn attack is a line or cone aoe attack . 
  this would probably be single-target . 
  yeah but this would be an original . 
  they 'd most likely be able to give out distribution wherever they want . 
  that 's what i 'm banking on , anyway . 
  sibelius is super easy to use and produces really nice looking scores without effort . 
  finale is more flexible , but is just stupidly hard to use . 
  dorico is the new kid of the block . 
  i have n't used it myself , but from what i 've heard it 's as easy to use as sibelius , but somewhat more modern in its design , and has attempted to fix some long-standing problems sibelius has had . 
  sibelius is , for what it 's worth , basically on life support at this point . 
  avid fired its original development team and hired a cheaper one , and there have been no * significant * updates since then . 
  many people from that old team ended up working on dorico . 
  the free ones are , honestly , terrible . 
  they suffer from the ease of use of finale and a lack of flexibility worse than sibelius . 
  they also by default end up producing really ugly scores and require some tinkering to get things working . 
  i can * alway * tell when someone 's given me a score from musescore because they look awful . 
  that said , musescore is probably the best option if you do want something free . 
  but if you can find ... alternative ... ways to get a copy of sibelius or dorico , that would be the even better option . 
  you raise a good point , and two weeks ago i would have agreed with you . 
  but this latest election saw three traditionally `` safe states '' swing the other way -- and these three states decided the election -- demonstrating that it is * always * important to cast your vote in a strategic manner , because you never know when the rest of your state is going to go full crazy . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  [ how is this * not * a spoiler ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pfey2gb.png ) ? 
  besides , the implication of the title with the picture was obvious . 
   beethoven, 
   piano sonatas ops . 
  to provide a more easily understood reference , that 's sonata no . 
  21 , `` waldstein '' ; and sonata no . 
  i 'd also add symphony no . 
  6 to the list of beethoven symphonies , as a fantastic early example of programme music . 
  i 'm also struck by the lack of any tchaikovsky or rachmaninov in your list . 
  i 'd recommend the rach 's piano concerto no . 
  2 and his prelude in c sharp minor , op . 
  2 , and tchaikovsky 's romeo and juliet fantasy overture and swan lake -- probably in [ suite form ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6zjqx2qtik ) rather than the whole ballet . 
  press the `` submit a new link '' button in the sidebar . 
  pretty self-explanatory , really . 
  i do n't read any comics . 
  i hate their loose adherence to canon . 
  i * love * comic book characters , so i 'm a big fan of shows like young justice , the dcau , and the arrowverse . 
   maggie and alex are closer to being `` the new couple . '', 
  malex ? 
  not a fan of either of those tbh, 
  these errors do n't happen without mods .

  first was mac os . 
  then they moved to mac os x. 
  then after a while they dropped the `` mac '' to just be `` os x '' . 
  and now this year they 've decided to start calling it macos . 
  considering it 's been over a decade and a half since class mac os was replaced , i think it 's fairly easy to tell what people are talking about most of the time from context .
