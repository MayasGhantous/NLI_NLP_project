  the new branding uses a lower case m. 
  there 's actually a brief moment in suicide squad that uses a variation of elfman 's theme . 
  but i agree , it 's a shame bvs did n't use it just like it 's a shame zimmer did n't use williams ' theme for superman . 
  you 're right , but that is a problem of its own . 
  economics is really easy , and also immensely interesting and useful as a general interest subject -- something you can use in everyday conversations and internet debates -- way more than i was expecting before i took it . 
  is the fact that it 's a jug of red liquid significant somehow ? 
  if so it 's gone way over my head . 
  no , should it ? 
  ah right . 
  an ad on american tv ? 
  but yeah , i did n't recognise it because i 'm from somewhere other than the us . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  it feels to me like it 's friday already ... 
  i read most of a clash of kings that way just because i was too lazy to go upstairs and get the proper kindle . 
  oh right , mascot . 
  the only thing i was thinking of when i read the previous comment was that they meant to say `` advertisement '' , so it never clicked with me that the typo `` macost '' could be meant to say mascot ... 
  there 's also / r/dndnext/wiki / resourcelist , though it 's missing a few , particularly the more recent ones . 
  normally i 'd agree , but samsung has a history of stuff like this and we ca n't keep letting them get off by blaming it on a few incompetent workers . 
  they 've been caught astroturfing before and suspected of it many more times , which means you should be sceptical of any positive comments about them online . 
  and then there 's [ this story ] ( http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/ ) , which is frankly evil behaviour . 
  they essentially tried to * extort * some of their biggest fans into working for them by pretending they 'd be reporting news and then trying to force them to work as essentially booth babes . 
  what 's this in response to ? 
  remember when a famous astrophysicist said `` ai is dangerous and we should stop doing it '' and that was reported around the world ? 
  it 's not even in his broad subject area , let alone his particular area of expertise !, 
  and also was entirely based around gut feeling rather than any empirical data or mathematical/logical reasoning . 
  in case you 're interested , `` salt '' is a bit of random text generated and used in the password hashing process . 
  it 's stored alongside the hashed password in the database and used whenever you log in , to verify your account . 
  i wo n't go in to the technical details , but it means that if the database was ever leaked , you 'd probably still be safe from attacks unless someone specifically targeted * you * . 
  i do n't know the details of this problem , but i 'm guessing somehow the salt that was stored got corrupted into an invalid format . 
  the salt will usually have a couple of non-random characters at the beginning so you can tell what kind of hashing algorithm is being used . 
  if those non-random characters somehow got changed and they no longer match any of the proper options , an error like this is what you 'd expect . 
  resetting your password probably fixed it because the system generates a new salt completely when you do it , for added security . 
  regenerating it throws out the old corrupted salt so all you 've got is good stuff . 
  i do wonder how it happened to begin with , though . 
  most curious . 
  op 's picture is the `` surface '' , which presumably is referring to the top of the clouds , or at least a very short way in to them . 
   ome where around 20 % of the way from cloud-top to center ( on jupiter at least ) your body would naturally float , since your density would match the surrounding medium so you 'd be naturally buoyant . 
  ... you 'd die instantly from the crushing pressure, 
  could you explain this ? 
  are n't we naturally buoyant at a fairly reasonable depth in water on earth ? 
  why does the buoyancy in jupiter cause you to be crushed when the pressure needed for buoyancy in water does not ? 
  it certainly seems that way , but let 's not jump to conclusions about causation . 
  maybe being hotter causes you to be closer to the sun . 
  or maybe there 's a third factor that affects both . 
   who wants to wager that they are going to make a similar book specific to dragons and undead ? 
  i ca n't remember where i saw it , but they 've hinted that they will somewhere . 
  edit : it 's in the introduction to the book . 
  page 5 , column two . 
  wait , adam ruins everything is available as a podcast ? 
  i try to download the tv show of it when i can , but it 's not easy to find ... 
  anyway , apart from grey 's podcasts , i listen to fear the boot , critical success , and the official d&d podcast ( all d&d / roleplaying-based podcasts that are * about * the game , rather than being actual game play itself ) . 
  other than that , it 's a bunch of twit podcasts : this week in tech , windows weekly , macbreak weekly , this week in google , security now ! , and all about android . 
  all for various different aspects of tech news/information . 
  that 's a bit like saying `` the door to door salesman was trespassing because he did n't leave when i told him to , so what would happen if i stabbed him with a knife ? '', 
   there is no caster-level in 5e, 
  yes there is : for determining number of spell slots . 
  that 's the * only * thing it 's used for though , as far as i can remember . 
  they might not have called it `` caster level '' , i do n't remember , but that 's basically what it is . 
  oh awesome . 
  i 'll definitely check it out , thanks !, 
  it 's also way way * way * ** way ** *** way *** nicer on multiclassing than 4e was . 
  it basically was n't a thing in that edition except in name ( and hybrid classing , but that was also ... weird ... ) . 
   in my opinion you usually end up worse, 
  that 's kind of the point . 
  someone who specialises in one thing is supposed to be better . 
  but multiclassing lets you do a whole bunch of different things . 
  one primary design goal of 5e was to minimise the degree to which munchkining and min/maxing can swing how powerful a character is : to make * anything * be at least a `` viable '' option . 
  and that means making it so that multiclassing is a tradeoff between being super good and fitting the flavour you want/getting a wide range of abilities . 
  off the top of my head , i think paladin 5 , vard 6 , bladelock 5 would be pretty damn good if things worked that way . 
  could go all-in on strength and charisma , or even better dex and cha . 
  you ca n't use images , but you fan use emoticons like ''  '' . 
  additionally , it supports a wide range of unicode characters , including emoji , which can be inserted however you normally would insert them . 
  maybe you have a keyboard for it on your phone , maybe you copy and paste from emojipedia . 
  it 's an extremely common term in rpgs yo describe groups that wander around just killing things , without being interested in things like story , character development , and role playing . 
  out of interest , how have you set that up ? 
  i 've been tempted for a while to do it myself , but i was n't sure how to go about it . 
  can you both send and receive using your own domain , while having it all go through the gmail system ? 
  physical media is no different . 
  just because you buy some music on cd does n't mean you own the music and can so what you want with it legally . 
  sure , no one can take it away from you , but legally you only have a license to it . 
  someone politely corrects your grammar and your immediate response is to insult them ? 
  the dick in this situation is not bluedrache , i do n't think . 
  no , discord uses a different syntax ( and , imo , a much better one ) . 
  discord uses `` markdown '' , which is the same syntax used here on reddit , as well as on github , and is in general the most widely-used of these simple markup languages . 
  google + ( and by extension , youtube ) , skype , and apparently what 's app use this other annoying format . 
  it 's not markdown . 
  in markdown , italic is one pair of asterisks , bold in * two * pairs . 
  code snippets are a single backtick ( or four spaces at the beginning of the line ) . 
  what op described is the same markup language used by skype and google + ( slash youtube ) , which is slightly different , and makes * extremely * poor cross-compatibility . 
  you need to escape ( put a backslash before ) * all * of the back ticks , asterisks , underlines , and tildes if you want to get it to display correctly . 
  [ robert , scott , and kavinay have responded to this far better than i ever could ] ( https://www.quora.com/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-at-this-point-that-zack-snyder-just-doesnt-get-superman ) . 
  i 'll just add that it should n't matter which skills you take when . 
  raw any time you are given a skill selection to make , but you already have proficiency in all the options , you can choose * any * other skill . 
   if a character would gain the same proficiency from, 
  two different sources , he or she can choose a different, 
  proficiency of the same kind ( skill or tool ) instead . 
  just a tip , it 's probably not a good idea . 
  the thing that made qwerty useful back with old mechanical typewriters again makes it useful on small touchscreen phones . 
  by physically separating common letter pairs , the phone 's autocorrect is bale to more accurately predict what you wanted to say , and since the optimal method of typing on a phone is to quickly press in the general area of the words you wanted to type and let autocorrect do the rest for you , this makes qwerty ideal .
