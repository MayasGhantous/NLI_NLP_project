   the standard accent used by actors and announcers was `` southern english '' , an upper class british version that emulated the bbc . 
  the actual australian accent was acceptable only in low comedy, 
  i vaguely remember having heard this , or a slight variant of it where a little bit of australian peaks through , referred to as the abc accent , but i ca n't find any references that support this having ever been a standard term . 
  i 'm fairly sure it is , though to be honest if the person you replied to had n't pointed it out i never would have noticed . 
  i do n't really see why one would care about it , let alone care enough to make a comment about it . 
  does a grapple count as an attack for the purposes of maintaining barbarian 's rage ? 
  cheers, 
  nope , that 's not a rule . 
  never has been , and never will be . 
  this subreddit is about stories in roleplaying games . 
  the name represents the fact that many people like to share these stories as greentext , and d&d is the most popular rpg out there . 
  a lot of [ our best posts of all time ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) are written in prose or otherwise not greentext . 
   and i 've definitely seen mods tell people before that it was okay to post , as long as it was greentext style . 
  like literally how 99 % of the posts are written . 
  no , you have n't . 
  this subreddit only has one active mod , and i 've never said anything of the sort . 
   you should go rob the tutes . 
  i dunno , i 'd probably recommend against that . 
  breaking the law rarely works out on your favour . 
  not using blinkers correctly ( either putting them on only a few seconds before turning , or just not following the rules on a roundabout ) i 'd probably pretty high up there , too . 
  russian roulette , at least as i understand it , is way worse than a 1/6 chance . 
  assuming a game between two people , it 's a 50 % chance , since you take turns handing it back and forth until it goes boom . 
  works fine for me , too . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  i think there are some net neutrality concerns with amp , but personally i do n't care enough about it to have researched it , and i do n't personally have an opinion one way or the other . 
  i am so confused by this whole thing and have no idea what 's going on . 
  does that count as being hurt ? 
  if so , count me in . 
  awesome news !, 
  now the only question is where * will * it be ? 
  netflix is the obvious possibility , but are there any other likely contenders ? 
  [ golliwog 's cakewalk , by debussy ] ( https://youtu.be/tnkbhv5wsrw ) . 
  i really love the fact that a composer normally thought of as a very impressionist composer wrote a really upbeat ragtime piece . 
  the wagner quotations in the middle section are great fun , too . 
  rules as written are quite clear . 
  if you gain proficiency in the same skill multiple times , regardless of the source , you can then gain proficiency in anything . 
  now , whether they is what they * intended * ( i.e. , whether it 's rai ) is certainly up for debate . 
  but a strict raw argument has only one possible conclusion . 
  that gives a good argument for why it may not necessarily be the rule as intended , but it changes nothing about rules as written . 
  the written rule is not ambiguous . 
  the part mentioning skills from multiple sources just says multiple sources , and makes no judgement about the type of source . 
  i do n't have my phb handy right now , but i bet there is something in the context of that smite description that disambiguates things in a way that the context of the multiple skill sources does not . 
  i ca n't comment specifically on the ergodox , but i use my own variant of dvorak based off of programmer dvorak while i 'm coding . 
  i switch back to normal dvorak for every day tasks like web browsing and writing ( non-latex ) documents . 
  much like someone who speaks multiple languages can instinctively switch between the two of them based on context , i find myself naturally switching the way i type based on what task i 'm doing . 
  [ here is the layout i use ] ( http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/76c3309992a060beaddffcddb55752d7 ) . 
  my primary point of difference to * the * programmer 's dvorak is a sort of symmetry in using the different types of brackets . 
  normal brackets are made by the index finger moving up and inward , square brackets are the middle finger up and inward , and curly braces are the fourth ( ring ) finger moving up and slightly outward . 
  it also means the asterisk and plus signs are roughly in symmetry to one another . 
  you also get easy access to `` $ '' for languages that use that as variable indicators , and i 've put the numbers in the right order instead of that bizarre alteration programmer dvorak goes with . 
  i would probably be tempted to play the shawm ( ancestor of the modern oboe ) or the chalumeau ( ancestor of the modern clarinet ) . 
  or perhaps the duduk -- an instrument i guarantee you have heard but provably not heard of . 
  it 's `` that middle-eastern/exotic sounding woodwind instrument from movies and tv '' . 
  it 's used everywhere , but most notably gladiator and the remake of battlestar galactica , as well as a digitally altered version being the `` tsungi horn '' in the show avatar . 
  it 's also used a lot on game of thrones , particularly in danaerys 's storyline . 
  they 're all more or less period appropriate , and i just really like the idea of a woodwind instrument . 
  something you ca n't sing over makes it a bit more unorthodox compared to the usual lute or lyre . 
  two things worth looking at are the rune magic unearthed arcana article , and the rune system included in sword king 's thunder . 
  korea was a proxy war for the cold war . 
  i 've heard of it . 
  i 'm like 80 % sure it 's a us state . 
  no idea where it is or what 's significant about it . 
  i 'm assuming it 's one of the dozens of states that are , from an international perspective , irrelevant . 
  i 've always found it somewhat bizarre the huge number of really tiny states in america . 
  america 's 48 contiguous states are roughly the same in area to australia 's 6 states and two mainland territories , for some context . 
  copy and paste it . 
  sibelius does the work for you if you want them to sound the same at concert pitch . 
  i 've always thought that the consequences of being captured were way too harsh as it is . 
  i save scum to avoid it desperately because at that point i might as well start again . 
  that depends on whether you wrote it in concert pitch or not . 
  is the `` transposing score '' key pressed ? 
  tenor saxes are in b \u266d . 
  so a written c on the tenor will sound like a b \u266d on the piano . 
  it 's important when writing a score in sibelius to be aware of whether you 're writing in concert pitch or written pitch . 
  if the sheet you were given was * originally * for tenor , and you were writing it into sibelius as it was , you need to ensure that the `` transposing score '' button was pressed . 
  it should look like [ this ] ( http://www.sibeliusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/transposing-score.png ) , or [ this ] ( http://blogs.online.berklee.edu/tomrudolph/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sibelius7menu.png ) . 
  if you did that correctly , all you need to do is add an alto saxophone to the score and copy and paste from the tenor staff to the alto one . 
  if you * did n't * do it correctly , then you need to correct that . 
  click that button . 
  the whole score will now be out by one note . 
  first , fix the key signature ( shortcut key : k , from memory ) so that it displays correctly . 
  the key signature selector works on * concert * pitch , so choose a key signature which is two flatter than the one the tenor will be playing in ( if the tenor is playing in the key of d , select c ) . 
  next , select the whole thing and follow [ these instructions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twtmyzmrp4q ) to transpose it by interval of down one tone/major second . 
  if you follow those steps , i * think * it should display correctly , but you might want to double check that all the sharps and flats are still displaying correctly . 
  once that 's done , you can copy and paste just as if you did it correctly the first time . 
  psst , saxophones are woodwind , not brass . 
  but the way in which transposing instruments work is essential fundamental musical theory and if you do n't know it , you really should learn it . 
  whether you be a budding composer , a music student , a conductor/band leader , or anything else , it 's among the most fundamental bit of musical theory to learn . 
  tenor saxes , soprano saxes , most clarinets , and most trumpets are in b \u266d . 
  alto and baritone saxes and alto clarinets are in e \u266d . 
  modern horns and cors anglais are usually in f. though in early romantic music and earlier , brass instruments would regularly be in whatever key the piece is in , and clarinets could also be found in a and c. 
  most other common orchestral or band instruments are in c . a full list can be found [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_musical_instruments_by_transposition ) . 
  could be one of the states in australia that 's stuck using dst . 
  or maybe new zealand . 
  glad to have helped . 
  thanks for the gold !, 
  oh also i just noticed , it seems to say it happened 27 weeks ago . 
  probably northern hemisphere 's spring , then , assuming the screenshot was taken recently . 
  how does little hitler syndrome differ from a napoleon complex ?
