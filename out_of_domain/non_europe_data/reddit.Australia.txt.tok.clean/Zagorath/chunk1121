  when did that happen ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  who 's the exception ? 
  as an australian i can confirm , dollar coins are great . 
  so is not having a 1c coin . 
  now i just wish we 'd dump our 5c and maybe 10c coins ... 
  never change . 
   the style tolkien uses conveys a lot of information without much filler , especially in the hobbit, 
  not * especially * , * exclusively * . 
  the lord of the rings is a fantastic read , but it 's really sparse on usable information in a film . 
  a huge amount of descriptive text and background lore that ca n't be worked on to the screen in a way that increases running time . 
  the hobbit , on the other hand , packs an * enormous * amount of information into a * tiny * package , because it 's written with much less descriptive text and lore . 
  that , plus the stuff with the white council , the necromancer , and dol guldur , and making the hobbit into two mega-lengthed films , or two more ` conventional ' lengthed films becomes completely reasonable . 
  the three mega films we got was still stretching it , though . 
  every film had at least one sequence that should have been dramatically shorter . 
  escaping the goblin cave was just painfully long , and the whole barrel sequence was horrible in so many ways , but its length is one of them . 
  i agree with you completely . 
  the necromancer and white council stuff especially was * sorely * needed and the film would have been lacking without it . 
  it 's all hinted at quite obviously in the hobbit ( at least in editions subsequent to tolkien penning lord of the rings ) , and it 's necessary to tie the two film series together in a coherent manner . 
  it probably could have been done * better * than it was , but i get so annoyed when i see people saying they should n't have done it at all . 
  uq gives op bonuses for any foreign language ( maybe an extra bonus for asian ones , i do n't know , but i know my french was worth something ) and for maths c . but i do n't know exactly how it works . 
   she 's on board as a mental health professional to provide services to the crew , staff , and families . 
   her ability as an empath is handy but not why she 's on board . 
  i think her status as a member of the bridge crew would imply otherwise . 
  there 's no reason for the ship councillor to be on the bridge unless one of her primary roles is to provide insight into what people they communicate with are thinking . 
  based on how they described it , not * quite * . 
  that 's exchanging urls , which are text ( and usually ascii text , which is really simple ) . 
  it can be used to share links to images , but it 'd not sharing the image itself . 
  the above user seemed to be saying that they were converting the sounds themselves into images . 
  sending each pixel individually , presumably . 
  or at least , if they * have * been selected , they have n't yet been added to the moderator list . 
  you can see it in the sidebar . 
  mods are listed in the order they were added , and the bottom of the list is the_singular_anyone , who has been a mod for ages . 
  that would be pretty cool if the rules actually * were * the official rules . 
  but they are n't . 
  al adds in a whole heap of dumb shit on top of the official rules that makes it , imo , really lame unless it 's the * only * group you can find to game with . 
  core + 1 is the most obvious and non-contentious , but the artificial restrictions on which of the * official * races you can play with and their things with factions and alignments also strike me as anti-fun . 
  i also have to think that just as a consequence of the basic structure of organised play , it would have to be way less fun than running even the same pre-made adventures in a home game , since the dm is way less able to customise the experience to the group and the party . 
  that 's not something i 'd hold against al per se , but it is a reason that i think anyone who * can * play a non-al game would be better off doing it . 
  al should be used only when there is literally no other option ; it could even be used as a way to * find * a group to play with . 
  since the person you replied to has deleted their comment , i 'm going to go ahead and guess that they were asking about the sentinel feat ? 
  possibly in combination with polearm master ? 
  the problem is that people on mobile do n't see custom subreddit css , so they would still see the title . 
  the rule is ( or at least * should be * ) that you ca n't put spoilers in the title . 
  if titles of spoiler posts were blacked out , that would encourage people to put spoilers in the title more often , ironically meaning the change would mean * more * people would get spoiled accidentally . 
  if you see something with spoilers in the title , make sure you report it to the mods so they will remove it and prevent anyone else from being spoiled . 
  wow that was great . 
  i always thought he would have been one of those really hard arse grumpy style conductors , but he came across on this more like the kindly uncle . 
  i kinda like the way gish options exist today . 
  a fully half-half option would be nice in addition , but i like the idea that there are a few different options for `` mostly one thing , but with some of the other '' . 
  the ek and at are `` mostly up-front fighter '' and `` mostly sneaky rogue '' , respectively , but have the ability to use some magic to buff themselves , and then there 's the bladelock and bladesinger which are `` mostly blasting warlock '' and `` mostly versatile wizard '' , but with the ability to also get up there and swing a sword if they want to , as well . 
  sure , something that 's fully half and half would also be nice , but i like the versatility in options that the existing range of gish-like classes have . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  ## overall score 8/10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 8/10, 
  the formatting is fine , but it does seem a little ... off , somehow . 
  some of the art just does n't look quite right , though i ca n't really say why . 
  it 's mostly fine , though . 
  the wording is similar , nearly perfect , but a couple of things here and there that felt odd . 
  the use of `` themself '' , for example , is unorthodox at best , with the more conventional wording being `` themselves '' ( even as singular ) , or `` himself '' ( or `` herself '' ) to mention a specific gender . 
  there are also a few minor mistakes , like the use of the word `` dragonic '' as a language . 
  ### theme/creativity : 7/10, 
  the race is quite an interesting one in terms of its history and flavour . 
  a race created by dragons to represent their noble wisdom and force of will rather than their awesome strength is a cool idea . 
  unfortunately , i do feel that compared to the vayemniri of abeir-toril , this race is a little bit generic . 
  that 's bound to happen when all you have to go by is a few pages of racial information , compared to a race with years of history and a number of novels focussing on them , but it certainly was the impression i was left with after reading this . 
  a lot more attention to differentiating these scions from the vayemniri , and something about how the two races see each other , would have probably helped a lot . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9/10, 
  using detect balance ( fixed so that asis are +1 ) , this race ranges from 5 to about 6.5 . 
  the flight option this gets , i am choosing to rate at +2 , which feels about right to me , given that it allows wearing * any * armour while flying , but otherwise has the same restrictions flight normally comes with . 
  to be blunt , it ** is not ** a godlike ability , and people who choose to rate it as such ** are wrong ** . 
  this is certainly less valuable than the aarakocra 's flight , which is an official legal race and is generally pretty well balanced . 
  flight is very good , but it 's not game breaking . 
  all the options this race has are within the perfect sweet spot of balance . 
  the only problem with this race mechanically is that it has an immense amount of flexibility . 
  users can select basically any specific combination of features that they want , which somewhat defeats the purpose of d&d 's `` class + race '' design paradigm . 
  it 's not * too * bad , but there is an awful lot of flexibility here . 
  ### overview :, 
  pretty solid race , over all . 
  some minor tweaks to the wording and formatting would have improved it , and i 'm certainly curious to know more about the flavour of the race . 
  but over all , it 's definitely a good race . 
  the second brandenburg concerto ( well , the first two movements of it ) was one of my set pieces in high school music . 
  it 's really an absolutely fantastic piece . 
  probably my favourite baroque piece . 
  yeah i figured it was something like that . 
  thanks . 
  i think the potential for falling is the most interesting thing about the paladin . 
  facing a morally ambiguous situation and having to decide between the greater good even if it goes against your oath , and strictly adhering to your oath and letting some evil triumph is some of the greatest and most worthwhile roleplaying available in d&d . 
  the closest parallel , in my opinion , is the warlock . 
  it 's a little different because some people have argued warlocks keep some or all of their powers if their break their pact . 
  but i would argue otherwise , just because it makes the roleplay consequences more meaningful . 
  and like the paladin , the decision between following what your patron desires and doing what you think is right makes for some of the most interesting and engaging roleplaying opportunities . 
  is it `` fair '' ? 
  no , probably not . 
  but i think it 's worth it . 
  the classes all have some assumed flavour associated with them , and while i think it 's okay to discard of that flavour if you want , for the most part they come with really good flavour that 's worth listening to . 
  and especially for the paladin and warlock , the ability to potentially lose your powers if you do n't follow `` the rules '' is what makes them worth playing from a narrative perspective , and it is beholden on any good dm to give the player an opportunity to test themselves . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge .
