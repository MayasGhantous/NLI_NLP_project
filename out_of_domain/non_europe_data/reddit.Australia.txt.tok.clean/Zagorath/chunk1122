  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  you 're wrong about point ( a ) . 
  op 's prc fits perfectly into the normal spellcasting progression . 
  that 's the entire point of writing it like that . 
  it gains spell slots in exactly the same way a wizard multiclassing sorcerer does . 
  point ( b ) is a very interesting one , however , and is probably worth addressing as a community and deciding how to display things to allow higher level spells in prestige classes . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5e3xf1/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5e3xf1/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your posts or comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  hear , hear !, 
  sticky , please !, 
  even the animated series , which many consider the best incarnation of batman outside comics , and which * did * have bruce travelling the world training with different people , never had him meet ra 's until long after he had become the batman . 
  his main training in that iteration was with samurai in japan . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  also , you do n't need to tag it as 5e . 
  this subreddit is only for 5e or system neutral material , so it 's redundant . 
  no , the rules have always been 5e only . 
  we just do n't always bother pointing out when someone redundantly adds in that information . 
   it 's sick to think she 's still 12 something in her head ... 
  they actually had a throwaway line in the show that said her mind was aged up in just the same way as her body was . 
  it 's not much , but it 's something at least . 
  no , you can see it because i manually approved it . 
  i 've not been to tokyo , but i have a very hard time believing that it 's even in the same * league * as singapore for cleanliness . 
  that place is practically sterile . 
   i live in quebec, 
   and speak impeccable french . 
  does not compute . 
  source : what i 've heard french people say . 
  just so you know , the expression is * could n't * care less . 
  as in , you 're at the lowest possible level of caring .

  `` real '' is such a strong word . 
  it 's really more of a fun joke between the two countries . 
   when danish military go there , they leave a bottle of schnapps . 
  and when [ canadian ] military forces come there , they leave a bottle of canadian club and a sign saying , ` welcome to canada . ', 
  not exactly the south china sea , this . 
  ## overall score 6.67 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 5/10, 
  this entry starts out on a bad note , with some obvious formatting errors . 
  it seems to have been produced using the homebrewery , but the creator has erroneously used a level 1 heading in the place of the level 2 headings that are supposed to start a racial entry . 
  not only does this result in an overly-large heading , but it causes homebrewery to insert a massive and ugly drop-cap , made even worse by the fact that it also includes a quotation mark . 
  it also goes on to mix the use of level 2 and 3 headings , when a properly formatted race uses level 3 headings throughout . 
  the racial quote is also formatted incorrectly , being simple text . 
  the first line should be all caps , and the remainder of the quote should be italicised . 
  the source of the quote is also incorrectly formatted , using a hyphen and emboldening the author , instead of an em dash and normal text for the author . 
  it floats near the left of the column , instead of being right-aligned . 
  the word `` modron '' is inconsistently capitalised . 
  a race should generally * not * be capitalised except when it is the beginning of a sentence , but this document frequently ( though not always ) capitalises it as if it were a proper noun . 
  within the `` traits '' section , subsequent paragraphs are not , for some reason , being indented properly , making the text look much more cluttered than it otherwise should . 
  having a single small image is not enough to offset the fact that this is not a particularly pleasing document to look at . 
  it 's not * terrible * , but a full width banner would certainly help . 
  in contrast to the visuals , the wording and grammar used in this document is nearly flawless . 
  the only problem i noticed was the use of the word `` one '' instead of the number `` 1 '' when referring to the ability score increase . 
  ### theme/creativity : 6/10, 
  modrons are an interesting race . 
  the_singular_anyone demonstrated that to me [ when they shared a draft of a modron playable race ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlqkvjdjrjsdywvmc/view ) . 
  but this does not sell them to me at all . 
  if i saw this without * any * earlier context , or if i had gone into it before i saw singular 's copy , i would have rejected it out of hand as a lame idea . 
  this gives a fairly acceptable description of the race in an objective way , but does nothing to explain why they might be an interesting race to actually play . 
  it makes a brief attempt to give some context for a modron pc in some of the `` cogs of the great machine '' section , but ultimately it does not do enough . 
  the section about names does not even make an attempt to be worthwhile . 
  it literally just lists a bunch of possible names . 
  no context for where they come from , or how they would be used , or what they represent . 
  just a list . 
  one redeeming factor is the brief description of the modron language . 
  it brings a very interesting and unique idea for how these mechanical precise creatures might communicate . 
  it 's beautiful , in a way . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9/10, 
  here is where this race becomes worthwhile . 
  it is very well balanced in the sweet spot of power , with a wide variety of less powerful abilities and one pretty strong one . 
  expertise in a single skill is an interesting ability that rather makes sense for modron , from my point of view . 
  on a corrected detect balance scale , this is worth about +6.75 . 
  living construct , in this form , is worth about +2 . 
  +1 for not needing to breath , and +1 for the `` trance '' ability , the lack of need to eat , and immunity to disease . 
  ### overview :, 
  this is a race that strikes me as one where the flavour and formatting is there only because the author felt they were obligated to include them , but was really * only * interested in the mechanics . 
  while the abilities this race has been given are absolutely great , the formatting at flavour text is basically the bear minimum to be considered passable . 
  hear , hear !, 
  and like others have said , a second hand piano can be a fair bit more affordable for a much higher quality instrument . 
  that 's a better way to get a cheap introduction than buying a shitty little toy , and relative to other instruments it 's a much more viable option . 
  i 'd feel a bit uneasy about buying a second hand clarinet . 
  no problem with a second hand piano . 
  yeah , comment karma is superior . 
  not just d&d . that 's a pretty universal association . 
  avatar made the same connection , for example . 
   i do n't want the video to minimize to the corner from full screen when ... i press back . 
  what how could you not ?
