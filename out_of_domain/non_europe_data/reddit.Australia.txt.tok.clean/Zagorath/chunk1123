  that 's like , the most useful feature of the app . 
  one of the only things it actually does right . 
  it means you can go on browsing for the next video while you continue to watch the previous one . 
  if you do n't want to keep watching , just swipe it away . 
  plus there 's some original content . 
  the vast majority of it looks like utter crap , but there are one or two shows in there that seem like they might be worth watching . 
  i listen to most podcasts at between 2.0 and 2.6 x , with a couple that i 'll turn down as far as 1.6 if the content is highly technical or they have a guest that speaks really fast . 
  audiobooks 1x , always . 
  with videos , i watch most narrative content at 1x ( tv shows , sketch comedy , etc. 
  ) , but most `` talk at a camera '' / informative content at 1.5 or 2x , depending on the speaker . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5e3xf1/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) but outside events and [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5e3xf1/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  all of this is opinion , but you present it as though it is an objective fact . 
  in particular ,, 
   even if the legalisation of drugs increased the total harm in the world , that would be still be worth doing , because personal autonomy is the higher good . 
  is an * incredibly * contentious moral and political opinion , and you do n't get to just state it as an objective universal truth . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  it 's a really fantastic radio station , in all honesty . 
  a great mixture of old favourites and more modern experimental stuff . 
  one of the best places to go to listen to great music . 
  that 's a really interesting one . 
  what 's the infinitive of that in french ? 
  flirter ? 
  the new circles seem pretty cool , but the variant rule for animals seen is kinda meh . 
   there is plenty of homebrew out there that is far more balanced and polished than some of the ua . 
  see / r/boh5e for the best of it . 
  yeah , i feel like for someone to make the claim that they 've `` read many of the stories revolving around chosen '' , the sundering series is kinda a prerequisite , and farideh and havilar are not epic level in the adversary . 
  [ wizards officially stats farideh at level 12 ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/mm_faridehv2.pdf ) at the time of the * following * book , so she 's probably only around 10 or 11 at the time she was first made a chosen of asmodeus . 
  and it 's been a while since i read making of a mage and elminster in myth drannor , but i 'm pretty sure he was n't epic level at the time he was taken as mystra 's chosen ( though he certainly is by now ) . 
  edit : that said , it 's worth noting that the sundering could be argued to be an exception , since gods knew shit was about to go down , so they were creating chosen left right and centre . 
  it might not be the best time to consider what are the norms in who is chosen to be a chosen . 
  even so , `` the reason that chosen are powerful in the books is ... [ n ] ot because of any mechanics '' is still demonstrably wrong . 
  farideh 's soul sight and havilar 's summonable imp servants are clear mechanical boons given because they are chosen . 
  the infinitive of a verb is literally defined as the base form of the verb . 
  i.e. , the one that applies * without * any context . 
  rivers do n't split , they combine , except at the * very * edge near the ocean , when they might form a delta . 
  for the purposes of this , lakes are just another part of the river and do not make special exceptions . 
  i 'm also not sure why the big cities are placed where they are . 
  dig taruhr , especially , seems oddly placed . 
  why would they not be located slightly further east , next to a source of fresh water ? 
  it would also seem logical to me , though i ca n't say for sure this should * definitely * be the case , that the main road would make more sense if it passed through vammii , in an age where transportation is by foot or horse . 
   pc : `` i wildshape into a t rex ! '', 
   dm : `` um , your character has never even heard of a t rex before . '', 
   pc : `` i do n't care . 
  it 's a beast , it 's in the book , i can do it . '', 
  dm : `` no , you have n't seen it , therefore you ca n't do it . 
  that 's the rules in the book and at my table . '', 
  there . 
  conversation over . 
  no extra rules or clarification necessary . 
  no you have n't , dinosaurs have not been alive in this setting for millennia/don ' t exist . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   it 's forward . 
  as in , * progressive * ? 
  because that 's literally what the word means . 
  and that 's * definitely * a politically partisan idea . 
  and it 's listed on the side there as only $ 35 , so ... yeah ... even if your maths was right , your conclusions are bullshit . 
  a direct conversion would be just under $ 47 , and since australian prices include gst , it should be listed at $ 51.60 . 
  as much as $ 60 could probably be justified if we consider smaller economies of scale , and that the $ 35 might be a particularly cheap price for the thing . 
  but $ 90 ? 
  nah mate , you 're dreaming . 
  fuck whatever company that was . 
  they do n't deserve your money anyway . 
  i 'm removing this for your own safety .

  ## overall score 7.83 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 7/10, 
  the visual design of this document is not good . 
  like far too many homebrewery-made documents , the creator of this archetype has made the mistake of using a first-level heading when in fact the correct formatting would be to use a second or even third level heading . 
  this results in an overly large title and an awful drop cap to start off the entry . 
  having an image just vaguely sitting across the top is also not a good look . 
  it 's unprofessional and amateurish . 
  this should have been done as a proper banner image taking up the full width of the page , flush with the top , and with rips or fading effects to blend it into the page . 
  however , the picture itself is a very good one and fits the theme and the style very nicely . 
  it instantly gives the reader an idea of what they 're in for with this archetype . 
  the language used in this document is just fine , with no obvious grammatical errors . 
  there are , however , some ambiguities that one would have to clarify before using it . 
  showstopper says it lasts `` until your next turn '' . 
  this * probably * is intended to mean `` until the start of your next turn '' , but it could also be interpreted as meaning `` until the end of your next turn '' . 
  until the * end * of your next turn would probably be more appropriate , too . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9/10, 
  the idea behind this is a great one . 
  a fighter who primarily revolves around use of charisma and showmanship is a fantastic idea . 
  i 've had a player in the past who would have liked an option like this , and i myself find it rather intriguing . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 7.5 / 10, 
  these are a really nice set of abilities . 
  crowd pleaser is a really interesting design , giving proficiency in a particular skill , or if the user already has that , allowing the player to pick a proficiency from a set of other skills , instead of falling back to `` all other skills '' , as is the default otherwise . 
  very clever . 
  subclass abilities that key off of or otherwise interact with existing class abilities are always an interesting design choice , and showstopper is no exception . 
  the flavour and mechanics of it mesh so impeccably well , and it seems like it 's about the right strength for a 3rd level ability . 
  personally , i am ... unsure , at best , of unbearable ham . 
  i do n't particularly like the idea of fundamentally changing how saving throws work . 
  it would n't make sense to change all strength saving throws to dex ones , and it equally feels like a poor decision to change all wisdom saves to charisma . 
  it also is n't a * great * fit with the style of 7th level fighter archetype abilities , which tend to be more skill based . 
  cheap shot is pretty great mechanically , but the idea that it turns your attacks magical feels a little weird to me . 
  they 're clearly not meant to actually be imbued with * magic * per se . 
  perhaps simply saying that it can overcome resistance and immunity to nonmagical damage would work better , since that was clearly the intent . 
  thrilling spectacle and the stuff of legends are both fine abilities .
