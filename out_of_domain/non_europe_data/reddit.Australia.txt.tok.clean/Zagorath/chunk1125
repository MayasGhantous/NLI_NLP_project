  yeah the maths is definitely doable , but the calculation is n't intuitive or easy to remember . 
  i 'm not even confident my last comment had the correct calculation . 
  it 's easy to know how hot 20 degrees or 30 is in terms of weather , but give me the same in fahrenheit and i 'm completely lost . 
  the thing that bothers me is that they 're no longer making affordable ( i.e. 
  sub-2200 aud ) mac laptops that have a discrete graphics card to be able to power their one remaining professional app . 
  ( or their one remaining professional suite , if you count motion and compressor . ), 
  i miss the apple of 2012 ... great macs for relatively reasonable prices , and they were still committed to professional video , audio , * and photo * software . 
  i 'm not entirely sure . 
  i bought a 2012 non-retina 15 incher for about that cost ( aud ) , and i was devastated when they decided to cancel the 15-inch non-retina line , because getting a discrete graphics card in a mac laptop became prohibitively expensive that day . 
  when apple showed the slide in their latest presentation that * every one * of the new macs came with a discrete card , i was ecstatic . 
  but then i found out that was because the * entry level * one was some insane price . 
  $ 3,600 is just a stupid asking price for that , even with their fancy touch bar . 
  i have to say , hackintosh is incredibly tempting . 
  but one of the things i * loved * about apple previously , in my 2010 and 2012 mbps , is the build quality . 
  apple 's trackpad is literally * better * than a simple 3-button mouse for most tasks , and at least acceptable for those other tasks , where any other trackpad is simply awful . 
  other little things , like the magsafe charger , the keyboard backlight , even the laptop lid feels nicer than most other laptops i 've used . 
  it 'll be a shame to have to give all that up . 
  too am ? 
  i know the exchange rate has made a big difference , but it used to be that middle-range macs could be bought with discrete graphics cards . 
  hells , back in 2010 i got a discrete gpu on my higher-end non-bto ** 13 ** inch mbp . 
  after they got rid of the non-retina 15 inch mbps , only the very highest-end mbp had a dgpu . 
  currently , the cheapest mbp with a dgpu is 2400 usd . 
  that 's still more in usd than my 2012 one was in aud . 
  ( and even that is ignoring the fact that us prices are allowed to lie -- by ignoring gst . ), 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  nothing after revelations is even worth looking at if you care about the franchise . 
  i 'm really , really disappointed with how the assassin 's creed series has been handled . 
  [ this comment ] ( / r/games/comments / 1s7i7n/ubisoft _ surveying_people_on_what_they_want_for / cdus492 ) really summed up how i felt about it :, 
   what i wanted in assassins creed was a concise set of games , four or five games , with a focused story the ultimately led to a modern day game where desmond miles topples the templars . 
   but no . 
   now we have a platform for games rather then a cohesive set of narratives . 
  with ac 1 , 2 , and broho it felt like they could be leading up to that . 
  the story was fantastic , and with the way broho ended it seemed like it was really going somewhere . 
  then with revelations , we got some really cool backstory to desmond , as well as the other guy in the animus . 
  really great stuff , and it certainly could have been building towards something , but at the same time it felt mostly like an interlude . 
  especially the ezio part of the game . 
  still , the desmond part could have been a sort of calm before the storm . 
  now , i 've not played anything since revelations , but from what i 've heard from others , it seems they 've put the story on the backburner in a big way , and ac has turned into a platform to release yearly blockbuster games , not too dissimilar from call of duty . 
  they decided at some point to say `` fuck our fans , we do n't give a shit about telling a cohesive and engaging story , we 'll make it up as we go along because we can sell more units to morons who just want a new big shoot-em-up set in a historical setting every year . '',

  oh interesting . 
  the external track pad works well even on a hackintosh ? 
  yeah , it 's high school , not university . 
  your school should be providing textbooks ... 
   there are only 2 factors that determine your score . 
  your mental capability and how much you study, 
  there 's definitely more to it than that . 
  in some subjects ( particularly literature and many of the humanities ) the mood or predilection of the marker can have a significant impact on the grade as well . 
  hear , hear . 
  or not to am ? 
  it could also potentially by `` my sibling 's former roommate '' , or even `` my former roommate '' , since your father 's brother 's nephew could be you , your sibling , or your cousin . 
   oops i dont know how i made it all big , bold and beautiful , sorry, 
  the markup language reddit uses -- known as markdown -- converts lines starting with a '' # '' into < h1  ( top level headings ) tags in html . 
  if you want to start a line with a # * without * it turning it into a heading , prefix it with a back slash . 
  this `` escapes '' the character and causes the markdown parser to read the # as just a # character . 
  # hello, 
  becomes, 
  # hello, 
  but, 
  \\ # hello, 
  becomes, 
  \\ # hello, 
  i 've never even heard of this happening before . 
  schools normally just * give * you textbooks . 
  they belong to the school and you have to give them back at the end of the year ( or the end of the two years , in igcse or ib ) . 
  but you certainly should n't have to pay for them ... 
  why would it ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the fact that the first ability the core of this class gets relating to manipulation is at ** eleventh ** level . 
  being able to manipulate other creatures to their will is one of the most fundamental things about a vampire , and if you want to even * approach * that , you have to take one specific subclass . 
  that subclass has some other weird abilities tied to it . 
  it 's both an emphasis on the beguilingness of the vampire and also the fact that the can sometimes shapeshift ? 
  at its core , i think this is not a well designed class in terms of balance . 
  * everything * it does revolves around your blood dice , which are in * very * limited supply , with a maximum of 5 for the vast majority of play time , and even later on you get capped at 10 . 
  that means that anyone who plays this class is , frankly , not going to be able to do very much . 
  i do like the system of blood dice draining and recovery , however . 
  i just think basing the entire class around an * incredibly * limited resource is going to * seriously * stifle its playability . 
  even pure spellcasters get cantrips which scale quite substantially with level -- and have access to a very large number of spell slots , as they level up . 
  also not a fan of the naming . 
  it 's important for names to be instantly meaningful to people . 
  i 'm sure these names make perfect sense in latin , but i do n't speak latin , and neither do 99 % of players . 
  try to stick to sharp , meaningful names , wherever possible . 
  the vampire 's extreme reaction to sunlight is another one of their most iconic features . 
  probably the single most iconic thing about them , in fact , after the fact that they drink blood . 
  yet this vampire class has only vulnerability to radiant damage and the same penalties as a drow when in sunlight . 
  and for a couple of bookkeeping notes :, 
   ( or one other skill if you are already proficient ), 
  you do not need to specify this . 
  it 's already a rule that whenever a character gains proficiency in something they are already proficient in , they instead can choose proficiency in any other skill . 
  you should be using em dashes to provide asides/parenthetical text , not hyphens . 
  -- , not - . 
  the bit about blood dice in sanguineum maledicta should be moved to cruor tesserae . 
  you have currently * mentioned * blood dice before you * explain * them . 
  this is poor layout . 
  some flavour text to introduce the class would also not be amiss , and some artwork . 
  on page 3 , some text is currently bleeding into the third column . 
  in fact , the whole third column is filled with text that ca n't be read properly .
