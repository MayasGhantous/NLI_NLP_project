  that 's just my initial thoughts from a cursory read through of the class . 
  if you post future submissions that are a little more refined i might try to look in detail at some of the specifics . 
  cpp uses . h files too , does n't it ? 
  perhaps that 's where the spaces are coming from . 
  or at least some of them . 
  do any other languages use . h ? 
   somehow . 
  wallet cases . 
  they have slots specifically for cards to be stored alongside the phone . 
  super convenient . 
  to get things to display correctly on reddit , you need to leave a blank line between paragraphs . 
  otherwise it will display like this has above . 
  i 've never heard of that being the case , and i suspect it 's unlikely . 
  at no point in hominid history has australia * not * been an island , so reaching it required an immense effort . 
  so i suspect it 's unlikely that other species of hominid made the journey before * homo sapiens * did . 
  but i 'm not an expert or even a particularly highly researched layperson , so this is probably all bullshit . 
  even their own slogan is showing how fucking moronic they are . 
  ca n't write a single sentence without glaring grammatical errors ... 
   that was a sarcastic comment , i feel i need to point this out because modern politics makes it nearly impossible to tell the sarcastic from the serious . 
  you could have summarised all that with a simple '' / s '' .

  when you say it lets out some `` wild magic '' , i assume you mean that it forces a roll on the wild magic sorcerer 's wild magic surge table ? 
   sadly no one else did, 
  spacey did , too . 
  and as bad as the writing , directing , everything else was , the film is still lightyears ahead of the recent grimdark bullshit . 
   of course people here are going to think brisbane is better than other places, 
  that has n't been my experience . 
  this sub comes across crazy negative about the city . 
  young justice also did aqua man justice , so to speak . 
   getting better at swinging your weapon and staying balanced enough to swing again quickly after, 
  you 're not actually only swinging your weapon once every six seconds at first . 
  instead , your single `` attack '' is an abstraction of how effective you are at dealing `` damage '' ( hitpoints themselves also being an abstraction ) to your opponent . 
  multiattack is you getting far more effective and being able to land effective blows twice as often . 
  [ this roguish huckster archetype by / u/the _ singular_anyone might interest you ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlbfflbeq5azlwsuk/view ) . 
  the flavour associated with it is a little bit odd as written , but mechanically it 's a really nice fit for a rogue in the service of the gods . 
  it 's a simple common sense conclusion based on ( a ) basic understanding of how fights play out naturally ( i.e. , that one attempt at hitting your opponent every * six seconds * is a ridiculously long amount of time for some weapons ) , and ( b ) that combat in d&d is * extremely * abstract and any attempt to look at its mechanics literally is bound to fail for a plethora of reasons . 
  making `` an attack '' simply represents your character 's best efforts to attack their opponents over the course of that round . 
  with a rapier that might mean a dozen motions of beating , disengaging , feinting , and directly striking . 
  with a longbow it more likely is just a single attack per round unless you get really good ( i.e. , get the extra attack action ) . 
  i 've certainly never seen anything that explicitly states that you are literally only attempting to attack once every round . 
  the notion that that even * could * be the case is a little ridiculous , really .

  absolutely fantastic post . 
  but i do want to correct one minor error . 
  in bullet point one you say any complaint no matter how ridiculous will result in a fine . 
  this is not true . 
  if they complaint is sufficiently frivolous , they classify it not as a level 1 complaint , but as an `` enquiry '' . 
  specifically , according to [ their own website ] ( https://www.tio.com.au/about-us/policies-and-procedures/classification-and-escalation ) , it will be classed as an enquiry if the consumer `` is expressing a grievance but has not given the provider a chance to consider the matter , or is making the complaint for an unacceptable reason , for example only to annoy the provider '' . 
  now , i 've heard that they very rarely use this , but i 'm sure if your complaint is an obviously ridiculous and unfair one , they would .

   and implement four different solutions in code , in the worst case, 
  no you would n't . 
  you 'd need to implement two solutions . 
  check if i have the permission i need * right now * . 
  if i do , yay . 
  if not , either fall back gracefully or if that 's not possible , display a message saying you require that permission .

   between her and harrison ford i do n't think she is hurting for cash . 
  you could probably say this about any major hollywood actor , and yet we still see things like george clooney doing commercials for shitty coffee or samuel l jackson yelling at me to get in on some online sports betting company . 
  4e had a really good system for martial type characters , since instead of making a `` melee basic attack '' , they could use attacks that did cool things like cleaving from one enemy to another , or attacking and giving a shove with your shield . 
  turning basic fighters into boring `` i hit it with my sword '' robots is one of the worst things about 5e imo . 
  grappling actually only takes an attack -- not necessarily an entire attack action . 
  if you have multiattack , you can grapple with just * one * of those attacks . 
  not that there 's really any point to it . 
  grappling confers no advantage to you or your allies , nor does it put the grappled target at any * serious * disadvantage . 
  raw , all it does is make it so that they ca n't move . 
  so 90 % of the time , you 're better off just declaring `` i hit it with my stick '' . 
  fwiw though , in my comment above , i was referring to 4e 's at-will powers , not feats at all . 
  feats are basically irrelevant to this conversation insofar as it relates to the assertion that this is something 4e did better than 5e , and i do n't understand why / u/mrqueitsch brought it up . 
  straw manning , perhaps ?

  friendly small tip : use level 2 headings on homebrewery for races , classes , etc. 
  the level 1 heading exists if you 're printing out whole chapters of stuff . 
  more than normal collectibles because the diamond industry created an entire tradition out of it that basically everyone who gets married today follows without even questioning . 
  people who collect sports cards or whatever do so because they like sports cars . 
  people who buy a diamond engagement ring do it because `` that 's just what everyone does '' . 
  damn .

  whoa what the fuck dude spoilers !, 
   gillard had issues because she her majority was wafer thin, 
  she also faced some of the most ruthless post-fact attacks from the opposition throughout her term , and was constantly facing threat of being toppled by the same psychopath she ousted in the first place . 
  if you had asked someone in australia in 2007 if the situation we see today in 2016 could be possible , their would have been a resounding no . 
  all it takes is the right circumstances to change that . 
  the canadian system is fundamentally not too dissimilar to the australian one , and it could suffer the same problems if the wrong people got in power at the wrong time . 
  i ca n't speak for england but it 's common enough as to be unnotworthy , but far from a majority use , in australia . 
  your maths describing the extreme case is wrong because it 's ignoring proficiency ( which takes it from +5 to +11 ) and the barbarian capstone ( which takes it from +5 to +7 , before proficiency , or +13 with it ) .
