  things like advantage , lucky ( the feat or the halfling thing ) , bardic inspiration , and a bunch of other abilities can also impact the probabilities of winning . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  it 's not a requirement , but if you 're clearly writing in the * style * of a greentext post , then you should format it as such . 
   is it typical that every house rule posted on here addresses every single feat , class , race option combinations ? 
  no , but your example claimed to be the extreme case . 
  the strongest one could be versus the weakest . 
  i was pointing out where that was not in fact correct . 
  counting individual class features is probably not necessary or even a good idea for something like this , but at the * very * least , counting proficiency is a good idea . 
  raw ability checks are very rare , so cases where proficiency can not apply do not come up very often . 
  your example of a tug-o-war * might * be considered raw strength , but personally i would probably make it strength ( athletics ) , just like grappling . 
  thus , proficiency could apply . 
  mozart invented aleotoric music ? 
  ouch man , bad luck . 
  when i did mine , i got * exactly * the extract i did a practice run on the night before . 
  i was about to complain and say that does n't sound at all luke my experiences with msy , but then i read the bit that said this is only in nsw and vic . 
  apparently their qld branches know how to treat consumers properly . 
  no , short . 
  the word * sounds * exactly the same . 
  it 's just written differently . 
  your concern is appreciated , but unwarranted . 
  it 's a well-known fact on reddit that simpler , easier-to-consume content gets upvoted more . 
  images hosted on imgur are an order of magnitude easier to consume than lengthy self posts , google drive links , and the other common sorts of posts we get here , so it 's not at all surprising that this would be voted up more than other submissions . 
  and once something * starts * getting upvoted a little more than something else , that feeds back in , since more people see it , so more upvote , so more see it , etc. 
  as for `` guidance on how to use them in a balanced way '' , i 'm not really sure what you 're asking for . 
  they have a description of what the item does , and a rarity that should be associated with them . 
  beyond that , how they 're used is entirely dependent on the specific setting , campaign , and dm . 
  i 'm not sure what op could have provided . 
  but i do thank you for your concern , and if you see something suspicious in the future , please do let us know . 
  the idea of a player falling over randomly , or throwing their weapon across the room , is pretty goofy . 
  diving is the worst one as far as i 'm concerned . 
  if you want to talk about the flash or arrow , go to / r/cwarrow . 
  / r/arrow and / r/flashtv are shitholes and best avoided . 
  that 's the joke ... 
  that should actually be in parenthetical commas . 
   i would , of course , disagree . 
  true , but +1 damage on a d10 means that the average damage is going to be equivalent to a d12 weapon . 
  that makes using a versatile weapon somewhat more palatable , since you 're not trading off average case damage for the flexibility . 
  hands down the best one i 've listened to is [ critical success ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/category/podcasts/critical-success ) . 
  it seems to be podfaded now , and even in its heyday it was pretty infrequent . 
  but the quality is leaps and bounds ahead of the next best podcast . 
  speaking of next best , my favourite ongoing podcast is [ fear the boot ] ( http://www.feartheboot.com/ ) . 
  i resisted watching it for a long time because i did n't think something with that name could be any good . 
  but by the gods it 's amazing . 
  both of these podcasts cover general rpg topics and are great for either a dm or a player . 
  apparently he 's meant to be a decathlete . 
  it 's actually the girl that says `` sister '' , pointing to herself . 
  it makes little to no narrative sense . 
  building this guy up as a big bad guy with ties to oliver 's past , but then those ties being related to some dude we 've never seen before ... that 's just poor writing if it 's what 's actually happening .

  thanks dude !, 
  this is super helpful !, 
  i 'm totally going to email that address right now . 
  you have literally saved my life with this comment that 's sure to make your friend a lot of money . 
  no but seriously , this is the shittiest spam i 've ever seen . 
  i get normal links , but who creates a spam message on an online forum that requires the viewer to go to the effort of actually typing out an email to some super sketchy address in order to send money ? 
  not to mention 90 % of the comment is literally just lists of words about vaguely techy and/or money-related things . 
  any chance of linking to a less sketchy-looking image host , like imgur or reddit 's image host ? 
  if you want a serious answer , either octopuses or octopodes ( pronounced oc-toh-po-dees , or / \u0252k ` t\u0252p\u0252di\u02d0z / if you 're familiar with ipa ) are totally fine . 
  octopodes comes from the way the greek root of the word would have been pluralised . 
  octopuses is also fine , because english frequently pluralises based on ... well ... english rules , and octopus is no exception to that . 
  octopi is generally regarded as correct only in the sense that `` a lot of people use it that way without knowing it 's an error , therefore in some senses it * is * correct . '', 
  fun fact , in between 60 % and 70 % of cases where cyclists have a collision with cars , the car is the ** sole ** party at fault . 
  the number goes up even further when accounting for cases where the car is the * primary * party at fault , but the cyclist might have * some * fault .

  my rule for rolling is 4d6 drop lowest \u00d7 6 . 
  if the total modifier is not roughly between +2 and +5 before racial modifiers , allow/force a reroll ( force if too high , optionally allow if too low -- player can voluntarily take too weak a character if they want ) . 
  it means you get the best of both rolling and point buy . 
  it results in everyone being fairly evenly balanced so no one feels left out and no one can rule at everything . 
  but you also get some more varied characters , since not everyone gets that same `` one or two really strong '' , `` three or four mediocre '' , and `` one or two dump stats '' that people always default to with point buy . 
  instead , you might get someone who 's a bit of a jack of all trades , and one person who 's a complete glass canon . 
  most characters end up somewhere in between there , but the point is that you get more variety and more interesting characters . 
   there is a reason it 's not possible with the official rules for point buy, 
  and yet it is not only possible , but has a 57 % chance of happening using the official rolled stats , which i might add is the official * default * way of creating a character according to the 5e rule books . 
  ( that is , rolling at least one 16 , assuming you put your racial +2 in that , you nd up with an 18 . ), 
   i think it is extremely rare to find someone that honestly likes the insane gambling of rolled stats, 
  i have one player at my table who does . 
  he regularly ( but not * always * ) rolls for * everything * . 
  4d6 drop lowest , down the line . 
  rolls using a custom random race table i devised . 
  sometimes even rolls for class , though that 's mostly reserved for one-shots . 
  anyway , personally i * do * like rolling for stats . 
  i * do n't * have an ideal array in mind , and in fact the entire point of rolling for stats , in my eyes , is to avoid that . 
  when you use point buy , you invariably end up with the exact same distributions , plus or minus a tiny bit . 
  everyone has `` one or two really strong '' scores , `` three or four mediocre '' ones , and `` one or two dump stats '' . 
  it 's always exactly the same . 
  by rolling , you get more variety . 
  some people who are complete glass cannons , some who are a fully generalised jack of all trades . 
  and most are somewhere along the spectrum between those . 
  but it 's nice and varied instead of always the same thing . 
  of course , i do vary things slightly to -- as you put it -- iron out the randomness . 
  specifically , my rule for rolling is 4d6 drop lowest \u00d7 6 . 
  if the total modifier is not roughly between +2 and +5 before racial modifiers , allow/force a reroll ( force if too high , optionally allow if too low -- player can voluntarily take too weak a character if they want ) . 
  mechanically , this means you end up on average slightly weaker in terms of the total modifier than point buy or completely free rolling ( the standard array being a +5 ) , but you get the advantage of very frequently starting with a 16 or higher in your best stat .
