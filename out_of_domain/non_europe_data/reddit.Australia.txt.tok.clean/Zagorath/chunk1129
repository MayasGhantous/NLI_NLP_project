  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  his appearances on qi are also great , as are both of the short-lived panel shows he hosted , the bubble and is it something i said . 
  the online mini-series mitchell 's soapbox is worth a listen , too . 
  he 's got a great video about incorrectly used idioms that 's well worth a watch , especially for anyone that enjoyed this video . 
   `` chinese '' is n't a language , though ( although the creator of the map seems to think so ) . 
  no , i think the creator just thinks dialect is another word for language . 
  look at how , for example , thai , khmer , and vietnamese are all labelled `` local dialects '' . 
  to me , that 's an indication that they probably * do * recognise that there area number of distinct languages spoken in china . 
  they just used the wrong key . 
  anyone know why star wars would be trending half a week before rogue one comes out ? 
  i agree , but i would n't use the term `` crutch '' so much as `` device '' , because i think it really works well for the show , not against it . 
  there 's one that got pretty good feedback in / r/boh5e if you 're interested . 
  paging / u/spiketaildrake for right of reply . 
  you 're the [ representative for ryan ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/division_of_ryan ) ? 
  ok . how ? 
  this seems an incorrect ruling . 
  nobody in this chain is talking about rugby bats . 
  unfortunately the west indies are n't the cricketing giants they once were . 
  too many of their young sportsmen are going into other sports like baseball and basketball , and cricket is n't as popular as it used to be . 
  it 's the best game of the franchise imo . 
  aoe ii has aged * really * poorly . 
  the 2.5 d engine of age of kings makes it an awful pain to play in comparison . 
  but aom is a fully 3d engine that makes things much nicer to play . 
  they also fix some annoyances like how gates work , how heroes work in campaigns , and each faction is built in a much more diverse way , making for much more interesting variation between civs . 
  plus god powers and myth units add a whole new dimension of really interesting gameplay . 
  imo the worst thing is n't the new expansion , but the new units and balance alterations that were introduced to the existing factions at the same time . 
  giving more healing options to the greeks , a ranged unit to the norse , etc. , completely misses the point of how these factions were balanced in the original game . 
  they have tutorials you can go through for the basics , and then the campaign is designed to introduce more complex elements a little at a time . 
  should n't be too hard to pick up the basics , though to get really * good * it 's best if you have a friend who can coach on build orders and stuff . 
  just found out woolies at toowong is closing down in the new year . 
  that really sucks . 
  the coles nearby is an absolute cluster fuck . 
  terribly laid out , always way busier , and more than once i 've gone there looking for something only to find they did n't stock it , but woolies did . 
  doing past papers in literature and similar subjects is still really useful . 
  in some ways , it 's possibly * more * useful , since with the factual subjects you * can * do it the way mike described , whereas the only way to learn how to write a good literature paper is to do it and get feedback on what was good and not . 
  as for the mind reading thing , wow , that makes me * really * disappointed in whatever education system grey went through . 
  the ib literature curriculum , which i took , strongly emphasises the fact that individual interpretations of a text are all equally valid , so long as you can find evidence within the text to back them up . 
  you just ca n't get that horror situation where the teacher has ` their ' interpretation , and as a student you have to agree with that or get bad marks . 
  you mean a white elephant gift exchange ? 
   some school systems do actually try to assess students on their ability to independently interpret something . 
  usually either giving them a new text in the exam, 
  one of the ib literature papers is an unseen extract . 
  i remember mine was from kafka 's metamorphosis . 
  it 's useful to be able to , under pressure , read a text and provide an analysis of it . 
  there 's also a paper on a text that 's already been studied , which is a useful and important skill , since you can provide more insightful commentary on a particular question/extract if you 're able to place it into the greater context of the work . 
  the context of this thread is that i mentioned ib . 
  the healing-based monk is crazy . 
  there 's no way a * subclass * should have a better version of another class 's * core class feature * . 
  imagine if the eldritch knight , instead of having 1/3 casting progression , had 3/2 the spell levels of a wizard or sorcerer . 
   is lay on hands really a core class feature . 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  it 's not something gained as an option or a subclass . 
  that 's a core feature . 
  never mind moving stuff , i 'm in to the tele * pathy * . 
  reading minds , mentally striking them , manipulating them into doing things as though they always wanted to , etc. 
  see : star wars , miss martian/martian manhunter ( especially in the show young justice ) , professor xavier , mental battles between mages in eragon , and occlumency & legilimency in harry potter . 
  oh you !, 
  see [ / r/dndgreentext 's hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) for the best stories that have been shared to that subreddit . 
  philosopher 's stone and chamber of secrets are n't that large . 
  i could probably fit them into a couple of my shorts ' pockets . 
  ca n't be that she never died , because oliver was surprised to see her . 
  that 's because you 've put the soprano into voice 3 , not 1 . 
  fix that and it 'll display fine . 
  from 2005 or so until 2007 . 
  unfortunately my disk got scratched when i moved and no longer worked . 
  i bought a replacement , but it was published by ubisoft and did n't work online ( as i found out * after * i had bought it ) . 
  so i did n't play much from then until it went up oh steam . 
  as a side note , i miss the community from back in 2006 . 
  used to play really fun scenarios online all the time . 
  my favourite was an escape map where everyone was kronos . 
  the runners started hidden behind trojan gates and used both towers and sly passages . 
  that 's about all i remember . 
  these days i do n't see any of those fun scenarios . 
  it 's just normal random maps , which is nice , but does n't leave me coming back for more . 
  i play now just with friends . 
   i just have no interest in a batman universe with a legit joker running around and no batman . 
  the two go hand in hand for me, 
  to be honest , i wish he was n't coming back . 
  he was * amazing * when he appeared in seasons 1 and 2 , but the end of his story was a good end , and it did a good job of setting up the potential for a new future real joker . 
  but having a full on joker running around so long before batman is just plain * wrong * , and i 'm not looking forward to seeing him back . 
  i 've heard it said that this is something tolkien himself claimed , and that it was mostly is assuage criticism of him for the fact that he wrote something that was considered by many serious authors to be trite genre fiction . 
  and/or that it was him being modest about his own work , in a sort of `` oh , i 've made the language already , so i might as well create a book to put it in '' kind of way . 
  but this is just something i saw someone say on reddit once . 
  i 've seen no real evidence that it 's true . 
  edit : i wrote this thinking your claim was the same one that / u/gamerlefey made . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  [ here 's the comments from the last time this was submitted , if you 're interested . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2kwuop/the_tale_of_one_industrious_roguelong_story/ ), 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  pretty sure you mean it 's an educational information management system . 
   middle earth ( itself of course nothing more than an anglicisation of midgard ), 
  i do n't think that 's a fair assessment . 
  it 's more like tolkien 's idea of what an ancient/early medieval english creation myth/mythology might have been like if it had been their own mythology , rather than having it imported from the germanic and roman mythologies . 
  the four elements monk is widely regarded as just * generally * quite bad . 
  but even if it were n't ( for example , if you were to use / u/spiketaildrake 's [ rework of it ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 3tg6ak/way _ of_4_elements_remastered_by_uspiketaildrake / ) ) , it 's still not really an avatar-themed class . 
  it 's a monk first and foremost , and most of its work is always going to be the martial artistry of a monk . 
  being an elemental monk just gives you a few more options that you can throw around here or there . 
  it 's a slight flavouring of benderness without a strong mechanical backing to that flavour .
