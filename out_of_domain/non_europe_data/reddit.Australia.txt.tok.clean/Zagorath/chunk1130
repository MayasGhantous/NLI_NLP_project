  news is claiming they 'll likely use the same mechanism they currently use to block sites on interpol 's child porn block list . 
  i do n't know what that method is , but i 'd assume it 's somewhat more robust than dns blocking . 
  ## overall score 7/10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 7/10, 
  the wording is mostly technically fine , but in many ways feels somewhat awkward to me . 
  nothing easy to pin down , but it feels slightly ... * off * . 
  the only actual definite grammatical errors in this document i could find are the use of `` is '' instead of `` are '' in the penultimate sentence of arcane space-time correlation , and `` have '' instead of `` has '' in the first sentence of overload . 
  it 's visually okay , but not great . 
  the image looks as though it might have been squished , and the way in which it 's being cut off at the bottom and right edges , instead of being flush with the edge of the page , is not a great look . 
  as / u/leuku noted , the spacing between `` the forgotten one expanded spell list '' and the table is too small , as is the amount of space between the two columns of the table . 
  the placement of the credits so far down the page , over the image , is also weird . 
  or more precisely , the huge amount of negative space between overload and the credits looks awkward . 
  ### theme/creativity : 6/10, 
  the similarities between this and the great old one are obvious , but i think the forgotten one 's author has done a pretty good job of differentiating this from that . 
  rather than being some overwhelming force so far removed from the material plane as to be unknowable , this patron is simply one that has been lost to time . 
  an okay idea , but i 'm not sure if it 's really been capitalised upon . 
  the choice of spells seems a good fit , but the rest of the abilities do n't say `` ancient forgotten abilities '' to me . 
  mind over matter lacks * any * flavour text , which is a major mark against this patron , because the ability does n't make a lot of sense at all . 
  arcane space-time correlation is an ability that 's difficult to swallow , in terms of its flavour -- why would a warlock be able to change an ability targetting * wisdom * ( or really any stat other than dexterity and * maybe * strength ) to target their ac instead ? 
  -- but it at least tries to justify itself . 
  changing it so that you can use your charisma instead of a dexterity saving throw does n't make any sense , and the text does n't even attempt to justify it . 
  duel of minds is a ** great ** ability . 
  it 's the kind of ability that i really want to see in a psionics class . 
  but again , it 's not really an ability that feels tied to an ancient forgotten power . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 8/10, 
  mechanically , i do n't feel like there 's a lot to be said about this . 
  none of the spell options seem like dangerous ones to give a warlock , and the first three patron abilities are all fine , both in terms of fitting the profile for a warlock patron and they feel to me an appropriate level . 
  none of them except * perhaps * duel of minds stand out to me as really fantastic examples of warlock abilities . 
  they 're just kind of ... acceptable . 
  overload is the biggest mechanical problem with this patron . 
  spending an extra spell slot ( an extremely scarce resource for a warlock , particularly if they 've gone all 14 levels in it , rather than multiclassing ) to only increase the probability that your spell will succeed , rather than guarantee it , is a big ask . 
  this ability might have been better as a short rest , or possibly long rest , feature , instead . 
  ### overview :, 
  this is a ... passable ... warlock patron . 
  there 's not a lot more that can be said about it . 
  a few minor issues that can be directly pointed at , but for the most part it 's just not something that feels like it stands out in any particular way . 
  the worst thing about it , though , is that the flavour just does n't make sense . 
  the reasonable mechanics are this patron 's biggest redeeming factor , but they are not enough , in my opinion , to save the forgotten one from mediocrity . 
  and of course , the vast majority of creatures , including the game 's eponymous dragons , are things that nobody has or * can * have any trademark over . 
  if what you 're doing could be considered in any way `` generic fantasy '' , it 's almost certainly in the clear . 
  but we also really like tea ? 
  maybe he should go to france or something . 
  i have heard that . 
  there was an episode of gruen about it . 
  s08e01 , apparently . 
  you might be interested in that if you can find it . 
  does n't help that modern family , in this case , did it * way * better , with the double entendres , where this one was just random phrases that made no sense . 
  5683 does n't spell fart ... it 's not even close . 
  it 's such a simple basic thing to get right i do n't know how they messed it up . 
  not that it detracts in a major way from the episode , but still . 
  mostly the exceptions are when netflix owns international distribution rights and lists them as a netflix original , but it 's airing on a weekly basis in its home country . 
  shadow hunters , or whatever it 's called , is like this , and the new star trek shows probably will be as well . 
  the news i watched last night was claiming they would probably use the same system used to block sites on interpol 's child porn list . 
  i do n't know what system they use for that , but i 'd be shocked if it is n't more robust that simple dns blocking . 
  200 bike spots and 132 car parks for 1300 residents ? 
  that seems ... problematic ... 
  i love frostfall and realistic needs , but i would absolutely ** not ** recommend them for a first timer . 
  the realistic carrying thing sounds awful . 
  i 've got all my gear enchanted to increase carry capacity , i 'm wearing a backpack that adds +50 from some other mod , and in a stamina heavy character , because not being able to carry a bunch of stuff is a massive pain in the arse in skyrim .

  ah , that 's a fair point . 
  i must have missed that . 
  still , there are definitely cases that i still have problems with . 
  blight , for example , requires a constitution save , which is something where the accuracy should n't make any difference . 
  circle of death is the same , as is cloudkill , and many more . 
  dissonant whispers requires a wisdom saving throw to avoid its psychic damage , as does phantasmal killer and probably more , while spirit guardians requires a wisdom save to avoid radiant or necrotic damage , just to name the first few i noticed . 
  because of the vague wording of the ability , it 's arguable that phantasmal force could be a spell that requires an intelligence saving throw to avoid damage . 
  and , as i read through the spells to provide these examples , i 've noticed that even the strength-based ones tend to be described in such a way that it 's difficult to justify an increase in accuracy being the reason for disadvantage on the save . 
  arms of hadar , ensnaring strike , and wind wall , for example . 
  there are definitely enough spells , and with frequency at a low enough level of play , that these could be considered an issue in terms of flavour . 
  the only save i did n't notice anything for that did damage was charisma .
