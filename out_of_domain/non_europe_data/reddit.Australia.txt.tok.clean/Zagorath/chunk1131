  it 's bullshit . 
  your isp is n't supporting the sites you visit , and they need ad revenue to survive . 
  yeah that 's what i assumed was going on there . 
   i am a fan of both , but for different reasons . 
  despite the spaceships , i am not sure i would consider st abs sw the same genre , or even science fiction . 
  that would be because star wars is * not * science fiction . 
  nobody who knows what they 're talking about would even consider claiming that it is . 
  i 've heard a number of different possible genres for it . 
  science fantasy , space fantasy , space opera , etc. 
  but it most definitively is not scifi . 
   the eu seems to embody the values of trek 's federation, 
  i mean , maybe this is their stated goals , and perhaps they have this perception among americans , but it 's really not accurate . 
  they 're an immensely protectionist group that supports free trade only when it specifically benefits members , and they actively punish commercial successes , especially in the tech industry . 
  the eu absolutely despises technology and they go out of their way to pass stupid laws that make it worse for the consumer and for the companies that make the technology . 
  and that 's without getting in to their extremely conservative -- penally so -- monetary policies that have recently done more harm than good . 
  they 're probably a net good in the world , largely due to helping keep the peace in europe these past 70 years ( including the eu 's predecessors ) . 
  but they are a long , * long * way from the idealised future of humanity represented by the united federation of planets . 
  unrelated , i 'd be concerned about drawing * any * conclusions about the broader st fanbase based on a selection of students from a rural university . 
  intuition would have it that st would he quite strongly correlated with more progressive types , and your data does n't represent that . 
  but your data also claim that on average these students are conservative , which very much does * not * represent the more typical political leanings of students and young people in general . 
  so particularly when you claim the student sample could be said to represent the shows ' younger audiences , i think you 're treading on very thin ice , to put it mildly, 
  i think what you 've done here is really great for its own sake , and is very interesting . 
  i 'm just doubtful about some of the broader conclusions you 've tried to draw from it . 
  still o ( n ) in best case . 
  has to run through every value to check its correct . 
  more like the whole sport . 
  i did it in vietnam . 
  it was luke . 
  2012 i graduated . 
  are n't both of those substantially easier than maple leaf rag ? 
  i 've not looked closely at it , but i can easily play both of those , and mlr looks a little tougher . 
  if we 're on a / u/the _ singular_anyone love fest , i love basically everything you 've done , but the vampire is probably my absolute favourite bit of homebrew there 's been . 
  i do n't think conquest is necessarily villainous . 
  hard to justify treachery as anything but evil , but conquest can be righteous . 
  sounds a little like [ this story of a ` drunken fighter ' ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2178r7/the _ story_of_the_drunken_fighter / ) . 
  the most likely answer , of course , being `` wrong '' . 
  or sql ... you know , like basically every database system today runs on ? 
  or hold control ( windows , linux ) or command ( macos ) and click , if middle clicking is n't an option for you ( e.g. 
  if using laptop touchpad ) . 
  android does indeed have this option , at least on vanilla android 7.1.1 . 
  it 's in settings -  accessibility -  system . 
  near the bottom of the page . 
  system being a heading on the accessibility menu , not a separate page . 
  i set mine to a minute . 
  if i go too far , i hit back , which is set to 20 seconds . 
   does anyone have already a bootlegged version of this episode ? 
  i think you mean freebooted :p, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ really . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ correct ^ ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ word . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ wanted ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ reference . 
  the unexpected part is attractive women in wa outside of perth . 
  is there any use for the em dash * other * than parenthesis ? 
  walking on * any * road is a crime ? 
  that 's bloody absurd !, 
  in queensland it 's fine as long as you do n't cross the road within 20 m of a marked crossing . 
  wow wtf victoria . 
  between this and the dumb restrictions on where you can cycle , vicroads sounds like they just have no fucking clue what they 're doing , compared to queensland 's dtmr . 
  yeah that 's the one . 
  it 's just about the dumbest restriction you could come up with , is n't it . 
  all it does is dissuade people from taking up the activity , when by all rights we should be encouraging everyone to do it . 
  u and i , i can understand switching . 
  but why s and n ? 
  they 're already both home positions . 
  unless you 're using ` ls ` in a terminal on a regular basis , i ca n't see why it would be a problem . 
  ( and if that 's the case , may i recommend my solution : alias ` ll ` to ` ls - l ` and ` go ` to a ` cd ` followed by an ` ls ` . 
  saves so much effort , even if it were n't for dvorak 's awkwardness with the l key followed by s. ), 
  i do n't know , but it 's probably german . 
  really ? 
  both my old nexus 4 and my pixel are showing as compatible . 
  only $ 7.99 in aus . 
  that 's $ 5.76 us . 
  not getting ripped off feels great !, 
  this one is called `` classic '' , and the description says it is `` combining the best features from two of the most successful and beloved rct games in the series ' history -- rollercoaster tycoon and rollercoaster tycoon 2 '' . 
  with one of the expansion packs , you can even import maps from rct2 . 
  she 's also denise in boston legal . 
  i ca n't help you with handbooks . 
  unfortunately there is no * legal * way to buy the books digitally , and online retailers tend to be pretty crap about international shipping for d&d books . 
  but dice , i 've found to be really easy and cheap to buy through ebay . 
  in fact , ebay is probably the * cheapest * way to get dice . 
  you can use [ the free online rules ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules ) , which are pretty great , and some cheap ebay dice ( or even cheaper , a phone dice app , but physical dice are heaps more fun if you can get them ) , and put together a group of friends to play that way . 
  irl play is definitely * way * better if you 're able to do it . 
  roll20 is a decent substitute if you absolutely ca n't find a way to play in person , but if you can , try that . 
  ouch man . 
  because marxist and communist are a step beyond socialist . 
  they 're the extreme crazy left . 
  the left equivalent of the right 's libertarians and anarcho-capitalists . 
  the crazy nutters that the vast majority on either side of politics disagrees with . 
  the only canonical forgotten realms example ( and it 's important to specify a setting , as in some settings the phb/mm description you quoted may not even be true ) i am aware of , of a fiend acting in anything close to a non-evil way involves a * cambion * ( only a half-devil , rather than a full one ) being cursed by graz ` zt and temporarily losing his devilishness . 
  during this period he lost his fiendish magic , but he gained the ability to lie -- something devils normally can * never * do . 
  there may be other examples , but this is the only one i 've ever heard of . 
  the cambion in question got described during this period as `` a human in devil 's skin '' , or words to that effect . 
  for a full devil , i have read that telling a lie would `` unmake '' them . 
  it stands to reason that an effect that forced them to turn good might probably do the same . 
  they would simply cease to exist . 
  but that 's my own conjecture based on what i 've found of existing lore . 
  a devil becoming good is something that is much , ** much ** rarer than an angel falling , and even that is supposedly exceedingly rare in fr lore . 
  ninja edit : if this type of thing interests you at all , i would highly , * highly * recommend erin m. evans ' `` brimstone angels '' series of novels . 
  you 'll recognise the quotes at the beginning of the phb entries on tieflings and dragonborn as coming from this series , and the deuteragonist of the series is the cambion in question above . 
  it also deals with the nature of devils and their relations with the material plane quite substantially . 
   i think this sentence is supposed to be more a poetic description ... than a fact about the lore .
