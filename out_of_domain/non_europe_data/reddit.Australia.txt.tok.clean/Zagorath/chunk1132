  like many things , it depends on the setting ; but in the forgotten realms , it 's a very literal statement . 
  is there any setting-specific material on eludecia ? 
  does she exist in an actual world , with novels or adventures or something else bringing her into being , or is she just the result of theorycrafting ? 
  i 'm not really sure i see the difference , to be honest . 
  i 'm on mobile and ca n't watch that right now , but i recall an episode of the checkout where they said stores in general ( it was n't about steam or even digital goods specifically ) only have to offer refunds in the form the customer paid . 
  that means if the customer pays using steam credit , refunds can be made in steam credit . 
  if payment is in credit card , refunds are the same . 
  though customers are allowed to accept refunds in another format if they do n't mind . 
  so they 're essentially running the conversion from usd to aud twice ? 
  what the fuck , steam . 
  steam 's refund policies do n't fulfil their requirements under [ australian consumer law ] ( http://consumerlaw.gov.au/consumers-and-the-acl/ ) . 
  your real problem is that a huge portion of the population has the bizarre belief that the corporation 's ` freedom ' should be worth more than consumer 's protection . 
  hey sorry , but this was automatically removed by the reddit-wide spam filter because of the image host you linked to . 
  it 's actually a banned site on reddit . 
  i 've manually approved it now , but if you want to avoid your posts being filtered automatically in the future , avoid linking to quickmeme . 
  thanks , and merry christmas !, 
  which school ? 
  what 's the piece ? 
  # what do people think would be a reasonable way to make a class with two strong saves ? 
  obviously , the convention is to have one strong , one weak save , but i believe like any rule , this one is made to be broken -- so long as it 's done for very good flavour reasons ** and ** is carefully balanced with the stronger saves in mind . 
  obviously , for example , the ranger makes way more sense with dex and wis than its current design , as an example of the flavour . 
  but just swapping the saves out would be way overpowered . 
  ideally it would be nice to be able to alter its level one features to accommodate the stronger saves , but that may not be possible . 
  so my question is , what would be a sufficient mechanical offset to having strong saves ? 
  would dropping the hit die a level be enough ? 
  for example taking a class that would otherwise be a d10 , and making it a d8 ? 
  or maybe removing * all * skill proficiencies ? 
  or both ? 
  or would it have to be done by underpowering the first few levels of class abilities , maybe up until 5th level it 's noticeably underpowered in terms of class abilities . 
  thoughts ? 
  merry christmas , all . 
  merry christmas from / r/dndgreentext !, 
  if you 're interested in stories from roleplaying games , the best place to start would be with [ our hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  it 's got some of the best stories that have ever been shared there . 
  be forewarned , a couple of the ones listed as `` long '' are ** really ** long . 
  particularly `` stranded '' and `` demigods '' . 
  but trust me when i say that if you 're interested in the genre , these are * totally * worth it . 
  just treat them more like a short book : read a little bit at a time , rather than * needing * to binge the whole thing at once . 
  i ca n't speak for computer science , but my software engineering course lectures have all been recorded except one : csse2310 . 
  but i 've heard that even that gets recorded now . 
  why 's this thread not got a running scorecard ? 
  no stabbing butterflies or bunnies , but we do have magpies , which are a bird that 'll swoop at you completely unprovoked . 
  they can do some serious damage . 
   when is the deadline ? 
  the first , i believe . 
  laina , the woman behind overly attached girlfriend , leveraged her status as a meme into a moderately successful youtube channel . 
  the companies wo n't hire her not because * they * think she 's had plastic surgery , but because whoever would be * viewing * the work might think it . 
  thus whatever the product she 's morning for would be associated with plastic surgery . 
  the latter , of course , but i 'm not sure i see your point . 
  the included windows defender ( or whatever they 're calling it now ) is more than enough , as long as you are n't stupid in your browsing . 
  honestly , this is just rubbish . 
  i use it ( kubuntu , at the moment , but i 've used ubuntu and a bunch of other mostly debian-based distros ) regularly , and i love it , but it 's still not nearly as nice a general use experience as windows or macos . 
  it just feels clumsy to interact with . 
  i 've found in the last few years in easily measurable ways , it 's finally caught up . 
  i can install the os and then most common applications quite easily now . 
  but it lacks a certain polish still , and even as an advanced user i wish i could have the polish of windows with the flexibility and the * fully * unix environment that you get with linux . 
  macos gets a long way there , but the lack of flexibility can occasionally be irritating , particular when trying to run a web server . 
  i 've used both cinammon and mate , but not xfce . 
  my problem with them is that they 're missing simple features relating to how i want to interact with my desktop environment , without an easy way to add those back in , while * still * not being anywhere * near * as polished and nice to use was windows and macos -- the worst of both worlds . 
  being able to add it in is worth the clumsiness and lack of polish of kde ; this way , i at least get one of the things i 'm after . 
  i 've used gnome , mate , and cinnamon and ca n't stand any of them , for reasons i detailed in a reply to a different comment . 
  mint is possibly the worst of the lot . 
  my problem , perhaps , is that i am a power user , but i also want a nice experience when not `` power using '' , for lack of a better phrase . 
  not an impossible ask . 
  it is boxing day , after all . 
  seems fair that they 'd have the day off . 
  check / u/the _ singular_anyone 's submitted posts for an expansion to this base rule that adds more options . 
  actually i do n't think salt is a feasible option here . 
  it needs to be the same salt for each number . 
  for example if i have bob dole in my contacts , and so do you , and he uses the app , the app needs to return `` true '' for both of us when it searches our contacts for that user . 
  with a pseudorandomly generated salt , that would be impossible unless the salt was somehow generated once and communicated to all possible parties . 
  apple could get involved in that process , but at that point apple might as well just do the whole thing , which is unlikely to say the least . 
  1 day `` watch this video '', 
  it also means you get way more battery in the same amount of space . 
  the mechanism to allow the battery to be removable is really quite large . 
  besides , if you 're going to be carrying something around * anyway * , why not make it an external battery . 
  they can be even bigger and more convenient . 
  this mirrors my experience with the game nicely . 
  i actually quite liked the characters in it , and the lore is great , but for me it was the mechanics that were just unplayable after mass effect . 
  i forced my way through the first game , but got about one hour into the expansion ( awakening , i think ? ), 
  before giving it up entirely . 
  self defence does n't count as a genuine reason . 
  yeah but it 's mostly small creepy crawlies . 
  insects , arachnids , and snakes . 
  if you go up north crocodiles might be a problem , but in most of the country the dangerous animals are not the sort you can fend off with a gun like you could a bear or wolf in america . 
  res , because reddit is unusable without it . 
  hard to tell without something for scale , but it could also be that the ceiling of the tunnel is too low for a cyclist to comfortably fit through . 
  they did n't . 
  read [ this comment , and the thread below it ] ( / r/worldnews/comments / 5kr3h5/us _ sec_state_kerry_twostate_solution_is_the_only / dbqozg9 ) . 
  the comment you replied to was making fun of your grammatical error in the earlier comment . 
  you should have said `` spoken to * anyone * jewish . '', 
  i 've mostly heard italians referred to as wogs . 
  but it 's been in a `` that 's the term we used to use '' context . 
  nobody uses it anymore to my knowledge . 
  seppos , or sometimes septics , is still used to refer to americans , though . 
  when even america does the right thing , you know your government has gone full on fucking crazy . 
  what the fuck , turnbull government ... 
  a strawpoll is a terrible way to do this , because it 's a fptp vote . 
  should really use google spreadsheets and make it a checkbox question -- allow people to choose more than one option . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games .
