  you should try asking at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to ask questions about game ideas . 
  yeah no worries . 
  the issue comes if , for example , one day/time is everybody 's * second * favourite choice , but nobody 's * first * . 
  it 'll appear as if no one voted for it on strawpoll , but google sheets should make it the most popular . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i may look in to that . 
  does a window manager 's purview include the taskbar ? 
  i assume it would , and that it would include shortcuts like alt-tab , but it 'd be good to be sure . 
   my favorite panel show is qi , stephen fry hosts, 
  uhh ... got some bad news for you , buddy ... 
  nah but seriously , sandi toksvig is doing an ** amazing ** job of following on from fry . 
  some of my favourite episodes of all time have been the ones she hosts . 
  actually , he is , based on [ official sources ] ( https://imgur.com/q13jym0 ) , named not only `` doctor '' , but `` dr '' . 
  so not only is it incorrect to correct someone for naming the character `` doctor who '' , it is also incorrect to correct them for naming the show dr who '' . 
  i mention the latter part only because i have observed that the same types of people typically like to make both of these corrections . 
  i honestly watch most of his videos at 1.5 times speed . 
  they 're so long is the only way i can feel justified in watching the whole thing , and besides , is still completely intelligible . 
  has a composer ever written the ordinary and * all * possible propers ? 
  to be able to substitute in or out the ones need for any particular mass ? 
  on healing surges , matt described using a cigar to cauterise a wound . 
  that 's a * fantastic * example of how a healing surge works in 4e . 
  another great example is described [ in this article ] ( http://slushlush.com/2012/11/rules-of-engagement/ ) , using an excerpt from brimstone angels , by erin m. evans :, 
   he flew , one hand pressed against the deeper wound to his shoulder , one wing rapidly stiffening from the poison . 
  nemea and aornos might not be able to pursue , but the hellwasp would be winging after him -- and without aornos or nemea , he could n't count on an accidental ally . 
  he had to slow the hellwasp down . 
   he headed toward the chasm . 
   along the wall he spied a stretch where no soldiers patrolled -- just beyond a jut of broken bricks . 
  ** he pulled the straps of his armor tighter , making sure what was left of the leather pressed against his wounds to staunch the blood ** . 
  landing unevenly , he glanced back . 
  the hellwasp was closing . 
  the whole article is a really interesting read . 
  not super useful for players or dms , since it 's about how to translate d&d 's game mechanics into written prose for a reader , but it 's still really interesting to hear about . 
  you were fine the first time , mate . 
  if your army is large enough he should never spawn , or at least not spawn initially in a battle , if he 's at the bottom of the spawn order , which all your non-combat companions should be . 
   do n't search by now showing , instead search by cinema showtimes, 
  ah right , that 's where i went wrong . 
  thanks a heap !, 
  oddly , galaxy had the opposite problem . 
  it * did * appear in now showing , but not when looking for specific cinema showtimes -- for * any * of their cinemas . 
  other good things 5e brought forward from 4e are a much greater concern for balance among classes ( though not * as * much by far ) , a far less needlessly complex skill system , and the unmechanicalising of alignment and gods . 
  also , to generalise your point about cantrips , 5e bright forward 4e 's notion that everyone should always be able to do something useful . 
  no one should ever be stuck without any way to contribute , whether you be in combat or social situations . 
  no this is good news . 
  you 're getting the 1s over and done with early . 
  i heard the mods of that sub delete content from well-known or high karma users . 
  the biggest difference is that a 5e short rest is an hour . 
  4e encounter powers refreshed with just a 5 minute breather . 
  that means it 's very common -- expected , even -- that multiple encounters will take place between short rests in 5e , whereas in 4e it was just assumed that each encounter had a rest in between -- since that is nearly always true . 
  the other difference is that in 4e , every class \\* got an equal amount of at-will , encounter , and daily powers . 
  in 5e , most classes emphasise one of these . 
  you can refer to classes in 5e as `` long rest '' , `` short rest '' , or `` at will '' classes , to a large extent . 
  it 's not a perfect divide , but it 's pretty good . 
  most spellcasters and barbarians are long rest -- based , warlocks , fighters , and monks are short rest -- based , and rogues and to some extent fighters are at-will . 
  \\* with a few exceptions : notably the psionic classes that used power points to buff their at-wills , rather than encounters, 
  there was indeed . 
  unfortunately , its reception was less than stellar , and wizards seems to have decided it 's not an avenue worth exploring further just yet . 
  personally i put that down largely to their choice of the rune master as the example of a prestige class as a rather mediocre one . 
  the homebrew community has done a really good job of taking prestige classes and making good stuff out of them . 
  in fact , personally i think the very best bit of homebrew for ** all of 5e ** is the_singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
   also expressed all of your character 's out-of-combat abilities in terms of their five or six skills, 
  4e 's skills system was nearly identical to what 5e 's ended up being . 
  the only difference is that where 5e has a simple `` proficient or not '' system , 4e had `` trained or not , and maybe some static bonuses '' . 
  the actual number and nature of the skills was nearly identical . 
  i 'm sorry , no offence , but this is almost literally unreadable . 
  it 's basically impossible to parse your meaning out of this . 
  could you try proofreading your comments before submitting ? 
   you ca n't heal people by being inspiring ; you need magic , or really good medicine, 
  this fundamentally misunderstands what hit points are in d&d . they 're not a representation of how many times you 've been cut with a sword . 
  it 's an ** extremely ** abstract idea that encompasses the above , but also stamina , mental concentration , luck , and more . 
  that 's how healing by inspiration works -- which , by the way , even in 5e , can be done by bards ( to others ) , fighters ( to themselves ) , and anyone with the inspiring leader feat . 
  read this passage , from brimstone angels by erin m. evans , a book set in 4e forgotten realms , and which describes the application of a healing surge in fiction . 
  i 've emphasised the specific bit describing the character regaining hit points . 
   he flew , one hand pressed against the deeper wound to his shoulder , one wing rapidly stiffening from the poison . 
  nemea and aornos might not be able to pursue , but the hellwasp would be winging after him -- and without aornos or nemea , he could n't count on an accidental ally . 
  he had to slow the hellwasp down . 
   he headed toward the chasm . 
   along the wall he spied a stretch where no soldiers patrolled -- just beyond a jut of broken bricks . 
  ** he pulled the straps of his armor tighter , making sure what was left of the leather pressed against his wounds to staunch the blood ** . 
  landing unevenly , he glanced back . 
  the hellwasp was closing . 
  now , that just happened to be a 4e cambion npc , but it could equally have been an aarakocra ( to account for the fact that he flies ) fighter pc in 5e d&d taking the second wind bonus action . 
  matt 's description of a cigar pressed up against a wound to cauterise it is an equally good way of describing non-magic , non-medicinal healing . 
  or , if you 've got experience with endurance sports like long-distance running , have you ever felt like you could barely go on , you just had to stop , but you heard a loved one from the audience , or maybe just a stranger , shouting at you that `` you can do it ! '', 
  and to `` keep going , you 're almost there !, 
  '' , and with that you got a new surge of energy and managed to keep going ? 
  i know i have . 
  that 's non-magical healing , right there . 
  you 've never even * heard * of stockhausen ? 
  i mean , it 's one thing not to have listened to much of his stuff , or to like it ( i certainly do n't ) , but he 's probably one of the most well-known 20th century composers -- at least if you ignore the neoclassisists and neoromantics . 
  but i 'm with you on the other ones . 
  never heard of them . 
  mahler 's definitely got some very accessible stuff . 
  his 1st and 5th symphonies , for example ( especially the slow movements of each ) . 
  but for someone so famous , it often surprises me how hard it can be to swallow some of his music . 
  low 2 or high 3 definitely sounds right to me . 
  i 'm surprised to see copland so high up there . 
  we studied his el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico as on of our two set pieces for higher level music in high school , and it is * not * a simple piece ; nor is it particularly accessible . 
  it 's no berg , but it 's a lot more complex to listen to than the mozart jupiter symphony we also studied . 
  it was also the first time i had really been exposed to copland , and i do n't think any of my classmates had had an enormous amount of experience with his music before , either . 
  but anyway , i could wax poetic about nearly any aspect of classical ( or `` western art '' , as i prefer to refer to it ) music all you like , but i still unapologetically consider beethoven , rachmaninov , and tchaikovsky my favourite composers .
