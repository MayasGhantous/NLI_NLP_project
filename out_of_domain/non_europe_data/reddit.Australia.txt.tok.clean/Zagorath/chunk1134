  side note , wtf is indie rock doing there ? 
  that 's a completely unrelated genre . 
  might as well throw benny goodman in , too , while we 're at it . 
  ( not that i 'd disapprove of that , mind you . 
  i love me some jazz clarinet . ), 
  yeah , the fact that * everything * now targets ac was something that * really * threw me off when i first switched to 5e . 
  the idea that someone with really heavy metal armour can shrug off a * fire bolt * or a * ray of frost * just as easily as he can an arrow is utterly bizarre to me . 
  losing the different defensive stats is a * major * disadvantage in terms of 5e 's verisimilitude . 
  or even better , [ angry just today released a blog post entitled in with the old : transparency , design rationales , and monster building ] ( http://theangrygm.com/in-with-the-old-transparency-design-rationales-and-monster-building/ ) , about , broadly , the exact same topics as this video , but with a different approach . 
  there 's still an annoying amount of jpeg artifacting in that . 
  can we get one without that ? 
  you sure ? 
  i thought characters spawn in the order they appear in your followers list ( or whatever it 's called , on the party page ) . 
  companions are certainly at the top of this by default , but you can shift them down . 
  maybe it 's just selection bias , but it 's certainly * seemed * to me that they die less frequently when i put them at the bottom . 
  i do n't particularly notice who 's on the field at any given time , though . 
  oh for sure . 
  the fugue in the final movement is just stunning , and even the rest of the symphony is a long way from a simple nursery rhyme . 
  lovely bit of music . 
  but yeah , the 41st symphony , clarinet concerto , and requiem are among my favourite pieces of music , and that says a lot coming from someone who generally prefers the early-to-mid romantic stuff and does n't particularly like most of mozart 's work . 
  yeah for sure . 
  that 's * exactly * how healing is supposed to be in d&d . [ i was just having a conversation with someone who did n't seem to understand that in a different thread about the same video ] ( / r/mattcolville/comments / 5l1655/matts _ 4e_to_5e_video_is_up_lets_discuss / dbsse4n / ? context = 3 ) . 
  if you prefer writing in prose , keep going with that . 
  using greentext is n't actually a rule here . 
  hey sorry , but this subreddit is for sharing stories about the roleplaying games themselves . 
  to share your stories about the experience around it , maybe try / r/dndnext or / r/dnd instead . 
  damn , and a relevant username , too !, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   sounds like you 're really saying stockhausen is one of the most well among those who wrote what the lay public would not easily recognize as `` music '', 
  yeah , that 's really what i intended . 
  i did n't really want to list out all the possible subgenres so i used an admittedly poor shorthand for it . 
  the likes of p\u00e4rt and schoenberg i would exclude , but not stravinsky and copland . 
  personally , i find stockhausen particularly noteworthy mainly because he 's a popular butt of jokes . 
  that 's a * really * good description of how i feel listening to mahler , actually .

  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  that 's clearly the * intent * , but they still do n't quite manage to do that . 
  like i said , * fire bolt * and * ray of frost * really should n't target ac . 
  they 'd probably be more reasonable as targeting ( or using a save of ) dex and con , respectively . 
  or reflex and fortitude , to use 4e 's systems . 
  umm , that 's encouraging vote brigading , which is a ban-worthy offence on reddit . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  you say this is bad advice , and then recommend the heimlich , which [ is itself not a recommended procedure any longer ] ( https://www.accreditedfirstaid.com.au/2014/08/22/the-heimlich-manouevre-why-dont-we-use-it/ ) . 
  this is a fantastic write-up . 
  the only thing i would add is that prestige classes should never ** ever ** even come close to being `` better version of what you already were '' . 
  no `` archmage '' prestige class , for example . 
  actually they were introduced in phb2 , * long * before essentials , and in one of the closest books to a `` core '' that 4e had ( though as / u/starrynotions said , the notion of `` core '' in 4e makes much less sense than in 5e ) . 
   the difference is black and white, 
  pffft , that got a loud snort from me . 
  i have done something similar to op , but when i do it , we also roll for race . 
  the reason was just to increase the randomness , but it has the nice side effect of avoiding the problem you describe . 
  [ here 's the random race table we use in fr and other generic fantasy settings ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m38-n7l1a5xtmzar_qppfen0dtiycib_1ywkxo6j6bi/edit?usp=sharing ) . 
  rose is under irredeemable ? 
  as in the clarinet study guy ? 
  is his other stuff tough ? 
  i 've never listened to it . 
  and lutos\u0142awski is quite easy to swallow . 
  no idea why he 's under `` pain is pleasure '' . 
  certainly should be higher up than gods be damned * stockhausen * , anyway . 
  dragons are intelligent , but they 're also extremely arrogant , and are far more likely to want to talk and find out what these people who have dared enter their lair are after , before destroying them . 
  and even while fighting , they might very well enjoy playing with their prey . 
  look at smaug from the hobbit , or [ this description ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 2e682e/what _ makes_the_green_dragon_work_in_lost_mines_of / cjwhmus / ) of how to play venomfang from lost mines , for example . 
  i mean , if you want to play it that way , then fine . 
  but it * is * wrong , and it is fundamentally ignoring the fact that hit points are an abstraction . 
  trying to take d&d as simulationist is an approach that is * bound * to fail , and hit points are a * perfect * microcosm of that . 
  the exact description of hit points according to the rules is `` hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability , the will to live , and luck . '', 
  that 's pretty black and white . 
  you are , of course , free to change the rules in your own game , but you need to recognise that that is not how d&d is designed to be played , and it comes with the consequence of fundamentally altering how the fiction plays out -- in a way that , frankly , makes it far * less * believable ( why does killing one more orc make you suddenly able to take twice as many blows to the face as before ? ) . 
  / u/tylrias made a really good comment describing this further down the thread . 
  but even outside of the more fundamental problems with pretending hp is actually all about physical wellbeing , it has a * major * consequence of succumbing to the `` mundane fighters '' problem , where characters that are able to do magical things become heads and shoulders more interesting and worthwhile to play than more mundane non-magical characters , because they have all these different options for things that they can do , and you 're able to just dismiss any logical problems as `` it 's magic '' , whereas for non-magical characters , you try to restrict things to what you know explicitly is possible for an average person to do . 
  it 's a * huge * problem with d&d prior to 4e ( and on a personal level , is one of the two big reasons i would never even * consider * playing any editions prior to 4e today ) , and it 's something that 4e fixed , and 5e largely brought forward . 
  it removes this dumb pedestal that magic was on earlier , and is loosely related to the idea of linear warriors , quadratic wizards , which also was a big problem with earlier editions . 
  4e * completely * fixed this , and while 5e lost some of that , it 's still much better than older editions . 
  the point being , why should only magical characters be able to provide healing ?

  hi sorry , but i 'm removing this post . 
  this subreddit is for sharing * stories * about roleplaying games . 
  if you 're asking questions , you should head to / r/dndnext or / r/dnd . 
  i did this ages ago . 
  i hardly ever use facebook anyway , apart from messenger , and since that 's a separate app anyway i do n't lose anything . 
  your brother is right in this case , i 'm afraid . 
  watching the news , sydney had a better fireworks show at 9 for the kids than melbourne did at midnight . 
  not until just now . 
  melbourne should be same time as sydney , which is an hour and 4 minutes before my comment . 
  both states use dst , which queensland recognises is ridiculous and does n't use . 
  unless i 've had more to drink than i thought , and my reasoning had completely gone bonkers . 
  you 'd get a better reception if you posted this to / r/unearthedarcana , a subreddit dedicated to homebrew . 
  yeah that 's a fair point . 
  if you 're by yourself i suppose you got ta go with whatever you can , because your options are admittedly much more limited . 
  because i use facebook messenger * very * frequently . 
  it 's my most used form of communication , unless you count reddit . 
  plus , chat heads are an ** amazingly ** useful feature . 
  yeah i basically never use sms . 
  i have people 's phone numbers , but most people just prefer to use facebook in my circles . 
  much like , so i 've heard , people in south america like to use whats app . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge but outside events and the arcana forge all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  actually i think that would have to be the real problem . 
  the piece has * undoubtably * been electronicised countless times . 
  copied up , in its entirety , into sibelius and finale .
