  from those , if the piece itself is straightforward , it is trivial to count the total number of notes . 
  things just become more difficult when deciding how to count certain sections in a way that 's more nuanced than what the equivalent of a `` word count '' in microsoft word will give you . 
  yeah , it does . 
  i did a check before making that last comment . 
  i 've never gone looking for it or used it before , though . 
  i 've not seen it , and honestly i 'm glad , for the sole reason that it made some of the jokes in life 's too short quite a bit funnier , as davis references it expecting people to know it , bit is universally met with `` huh ? '', 
  or similar . 
  life 's too short . 
  it 's on netflix . 
  great little ( pun honestly not intended ) show . 
  very reminiscent of the office in its style of humour . 
  not surprising , considering it 's the brain child of ricky gervais and stephen merchant , just as the office was . 
  works fine in reddit is fun . 
  out of interest , do you happen to know how much rehearsal time the orchestra had for this ? 
  because the sound a little under-rehearsed . 
  not quite as in sync with each other as they probably should have been . 
  the trumpet solo right before the piano 's first entrance stood out the most to me , as did the clarinet 's initial glissando . 
  sleeping spores seems the most problematic ability here , to me . 
  that 's some really nitpicky maths you 're asking not only the player , but also the dm , to remember to constantly be in communication about . 
  if this were 4e , i 'd suggest making it proc on the bloodied condition , but unfortunately they threw that out in 5e ... so i really do n't know how to help you , except to say that if at all possible , i 'd urge you to find a way to make the player be able to know if it can be applied right now without needing to ask the dm . 
  there are already a few abilities that do require asking , so this would n't be the first , but those abilities are a pain in the arse to work with . 
  yeah that always happens for me with youtube videos . 
  not sure why , but at this point i 've just gotten used to it ... 
  it does n't have to be originally posted here , but we do need to be provided with a link to a time it has been submitted here . 
  i probably would have just let him do it . 
  all he really wanted was to do the same thing mechanically as everyone else , but narrate it in a cooler way . 
  it would n't grant him any extra bonuses or ability to do things he would n't otherwise be able to . 
  ok not really a question , but more of a brief comment not worthy of a proper submission , but did anyone else think the bor gullet in rogue one was reminiscent of a mind flayer ? 
  obviously not * exactly * the same , but it 's a tentacled mind-reading creature that also destroys your mind . 
  i 've googled around and was honestly surprised that i could n't find anyone else making the comparison , when it seemed so obvious . 
   pelor knows 5e is often simpler than some expect, 
  would n't oghma be a better god to invoke here ? 
  being a god of knowledge , and all ? 
  ( or whatever the equivalent god is in greyhawk -- pelor is basically the only gh god i know . ), 
  to my understanding queensland is the same as nsw in this respect . 
  hey sorry , but i 'm removing this submission . 
  this subreddit is for sharing * stories * about roleplaying games . 
  if you 're homebrewing stuff , i would suggest going to / r/unearthedarcana , assuming it 's d&d 5e , to get feedback . 
  you reroll 1d6 . 
  it 's one of the disadvantages of choosing 2d6 over 1d12 . 
  and yes . 
  the giant hp pool is one of the biggest advantages of playing a druid . 
  they 're the best tanks in the game . 
  i thought about that , but i ca n't think of a situation where :, 
  ( a ) wall running in a straight line a distance that they, 
  ( b ) could have jumped anyway and where, 
  ( c ) other aspects like the height of the jump do n't matter, 
  would be advantageous relative to just jumping . 
  10th level warlock abilities are normally defensive in nature . 
  the 6th level is sometimes also defensive ( but often in a less direct way ) , but sometimes more of a skill-based ability . 
  i would also like to know this . 
   debunked solar roadways idea, 
  [ you mean the one that 's actually going ahead ? 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2016/12/23/worlds-first-solar-road-opens-in-france-draws-criticism-for-high-cost/#7cfdc8985069 ), 
  ( not that i do n't also think it 's a dumb idea , but it * is * happening . ), 
  so what should you do ... 
  damn , where 's / u/convertstometric or / u/tometric when they 're needed ? 
  was it really the pagebot that malfunctioned , or was it * used * incorrectly ? 
  if you only want to page those in the house , replace the word `` here '' with the subreddit whose paging list you want to page . 
  so it would be '' + botsusernamehere / r/modelaustraliahr [ reasons ] '' . 
  huh . 
  was not expecting that . 
  i 'm a little confused by this . 
  why is your version of wil wheaton doing nothing but ** breaking ** * wheaton 's law * ? 
   how about a situation where there is no other side , but a hole against the wall 6 feet away . 
  now the precedent is that everyone can wall run to the hole instead of making a check to grab it . 
  i do n't follow . 
  why would wall running not mean they still have to make that check ? 
  certainly , i would say that they still do . 
   or , there is a ledge 10 feet away , but somewhat narrow , and would be a difficult long jump , but with wall running they basically just move the distance of the gap and walk to the ledge . 
  do you think wall running is some kind of magic ? 
  with the monk it might be , but not the way an average person does it . 
  the momentum they require to be able to keep up the wall run would make staying on the ledge just as hard for them as for a normal character . 
   or maybe the character got hit with dexterity damage , so they can jump the distance but struggle with balance , so wall running makes no sense but it 's established as being a flavorful long jump . 
  i do n't even understand your premise , here . 
  being damaged does n't make you less able to do * either * of these things . 
   or maybe the walls are angled glass , made to prevent climbing , but the rogue can run on it even though they ca n't climb it . 
  the only precedent that has been set is for vertical walls where the character is attempting to run in a horizontal direction . 
  anything else changes the situation . 
  which way is the glass tilted ? 
  to `` prevent climbing '' , presumably it 's tilted inward ( such that the cross section of the hallway is a [ regular trapezium ] ( http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/isosceles_trapezoid.jpg ) ) . 
  well in that case they clearly ca n't do it because the walls are not conducive to wall running . 
  like i said , i 've thought about it . 
  i ca n't think of any case where it would be a problem . 
  it really sounds like you 're * not * actually interested in seeing what the community here has to say , because the majority opinion is pretty clearly in favour of `` just let him do it '' . 
  but you 're ignoring all of that advice , and just responding to the people who agree with the opinion you came in with . 
  you 're not actually interested in the conversation : just in affirmation of your initial decision . 
  there 's a small but ** very ** vocal subset of people that do n't like him . 
  i think it 's at least in part because of his political opinions . 
  to summarise it , he 's pro equality and anti-hate , and this includes being against movements like `` gamer gate '' , which is a ** huge ** no-no for certain groups of people on the internet . 
  yeah i never really understood the whole gamer gate thing either . 
  from what i gathered , though , it was a movement that started out with a really good point , but a lot of people used the banner of gamer gate to share some extremely hateful points of view . 
  fwiw , my initial comment was kinda stating the opposite , though if you do n't already know what `` wheaton 's law '' is ( it 's `` do n't be a dick '' ) you may not have gotten that . 
   why would they make a check to run over a hole ? 
  the precedent is set that if the character can long jump the distance , they can wall run the distance . 
  why do they need to make a check to wall run into a hole if they do n't make a check to wall run ? 
  maybe i 'm misunderstanding the scenario you 're trying to paint here , but to my mind , they still need to be able to accurately get to the hole , just the same as if they jumped . 
  wall running for someone not trained ( not a 9th level monk ) is not a precision art . 
  all the wall running is doing is making it so you get across to the other side . 
   it literally makes you less able to keep your balance while running .
