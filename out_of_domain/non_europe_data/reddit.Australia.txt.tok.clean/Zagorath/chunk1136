  so would you fall over if you were doing normal running ? 
  again , the way i see it , this is not a problem . 
  wall running , if it is the same distance as you could jump anyway , is flavoured as nothing more than a jump where your feet happen to touch the wall a couple of times -- an entirely strength-based ability . 
  unless this supposed dex penalty is so sever that you literally would be incapable of running , in which case * either * method should fail . 
   the precedent being set is that the character can flavor their long jump however they want . 
  the wall makes no difference to the long jump , therefore it makes no difference to the wall run . 
  that 's the precedent . 
  that wall running is just reflavored long jumping . 
  if the character could n't wall run , but can long jump , you made the precedent that they can wall run . 
  because they are n't really wall running , but just describing their long jump . 
  yup . 
  basically correct . 
  that 's not a problem . 
  the problem is that that 's * not * what 's going on . 
  op is ignoring the responses that disagree outright with their decision , and responding only to those that already agree ( by saying `` yeah , you 're right '' ) , or to those that talk orthogonally to the point at hand . 
  op is acting under the * guise * of trying to `` get a variety of opinions and potentially broaden his understanding of the game '' , but not really interested in that at all . 
  if op expressed genuine interest in the opposite viewpoint , or tried to explain to people expressing that viewpoint why they nevertheless disagree , my comment would have been unnecessary . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  when rolling for stats ( which is the officially recommended system ) a 16 in your top stat is the norm . 
  i 'm with you on wesley . 
  he was an absolutely awful character , and i 'm glad that the writers decided to write him out of the show fairly early on . 
  but i just do n't understand why people hold that against wheaton himself . 
  he did n't write the part , and i know if * i * were on tng , no matter how bad the character , i 'd think that were a pretty damn cool thing to have done . 
  plus , imo most of the two or three small appearances he had after he was no longer a regular were actually pretty okay . 
  they were , not * that * long ago , one of the most liberal and related muslim nations . 
  unfortunately things have changed for the worse the last couple of decades . 
  does it say exactly where in finland he moved ? 
  maybe he 's somewhere in the \u00c5land islands . 
  and yes , i did just google `` finnish islands '' , thanks for asking . 
  could be worse . 
  at least the poor kid was n't killed for being a demon . 
  if they 're going to another material plane , i might suggest reading up on the differences between the two material planes in the forgotten realms as a place to get some inspiration . 
  you 're already familiar with toril . 
  it 's your stock standard generic medieval fantasy setting . 
  but [ abeir ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/abeir ) is its twin , and it 's a twisted world , forsaken by the gods and ruled over by tyrants like dragons and elementals . 
  i ca n't help you at all with the astral plane though . 
  honestly , i do n't really know . 
  the extent of my knowledge is that it started with some good points about ethics in journalism ( precisely what those points were i do n't recall ) , but then a lot of hateful , misogynistic people got involved in the movement and essentially took it over . 
   karajan gets a lot of shit sometimes, 
  he does ? 
  he 's always been my absolute favourite beethoven conductor , to be honest . 
  or at the very least top 3 . 
   luke also has a couple of serious personal flaws that make him unlikeable and that he has to overcome : he is immature and whiny . 
  he whines through the first two movies of the trilogy, 
  hmm ... sound like anyone else we know ? 
  yes , but if you look back up the thread , it 's about an `` island '' . 
  we 're talking about the mainland of afro-eurasia here . 
  well your current 6th level ability might fit better as a 10th level one , but i ca n't really help you much with the other ability , i 'm afraid . 
  you are . 
  what does n't make sense is that it 's marked `` solo ? '', 
  is it , or is it not ? 
  the score does n't seem to know , either . 
  you can include the type of thing that you 're creating in the title and our automod will do its best to pick the right flair . 
  alternatively , you can click the little `` flair '' button below the post and select the appropriate one from there . 
  a human 's terminal velocity is about 53 ms ^ ( -1 ) . 
  at 9.81 ms ^ ( -2 ) acceleration ( so yes , ignoring air resistance until terminal velocity is reached -- a very rough approximation at best ) , that 's around 6 seconds to reach terminal velocity , during which time you 've travelled s = ( 1/2 ) \\* 9.81 \\* 6 ^ ( 2 ) , or 177 m. that 's 580 ft. , if we 're forced to work in d&d distances . 
  that 's extremely rough maths . 
  the * real * figure is that it takes around ** 450 m ** and ** 12 seconds ** to reach terminal velocity . 
  but my main point is that even the most basic of application of physics , the rules in the phb get it wrong . 
  tl ; dr listen to the guy above . 
  he 's right . 
  actually , that 's correct . 
  if a feature requires `` an attack with a melee weapon '' , and you throw a sword at them ( or , more realistically , throw a dagger or spear at them ) , that feature * can * be used with a ranged attack . 
  the issue is that divine smite requires a `` melee weapon attack '' , which * is n't * the same as `` an attack with a melee weapon '' . 
  instead , it requires that the * attack itself * is melee . 
  the other consequence of the `` bonus action '' thing is that someone who multiclassed fighter for action surge * can * cast two spells that have a casting time of 1 action . 
  nope . 
  if it 's in the melee weapon table it is a melee weapon . 
  the rulings around this are all very complicated and quite finicky , but they make sense . 
   unless it 's at the end of the sentence . 
  right . 
  you see the problem here , yeah ? 
  not putting the space before the unit is generally considered bad style . 
  for the lazy , it 's 21/03/17 . 
  personally , my preferred way to play a `` ranger '' is to multiclass fighter and rogue . 
  sneak attack is an ability that feels quite `` rangery '' to me , especially if used in combination with a longbow . 
  gon na be honest , i do n't like bards . 
  the idea of singing or orating to create magic -- apart from charms , fright , etc. 
  -- is utterly absurd to me . 
  as a class they 've just never felt like they really make sense in the world . 
  i would n't ban them , but if i were going to ban * anything * in the phb , bards would he the first to go . 
  no other race , class , or feat even comes close . 
  that just makes it worse . 
  all the other casters have a source of magic that makes pretty good sense . 
  if the bard 's source is n't music or oration , then it just , what , * magically * appears ? 
  that 's terrible , and only serves to harden my resolve that they 're a dumb class . 
  a sorcerer 's magic comes from something in their bloodline , or a curse , or accident involving magic . 
  that 's fine ; it makes sense to me . 
  wizards get magic by detailed study if the innate nature of magic . 
  that 's also fine . 
  but bards ? 
  they do n't have an adequate explanation for the source of their magic . 
  the core class abilities are ones that i feel are kinda dumb , which does n't help , but they do at least make sense . 
  and probably half of their spell list also makes sense if you flavour it similar to the pied piper or something like that . 
  but then you add on stuff like * light * and * comprehend languages * , and frankly it falls apart . 
  and while it might be intended that they 're just tapping in to the same style of magic as wizards , that does n't gel well with the fact that they 're a charisma caster , and they can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus , in my mind . 
  bardic magic is this incredibly awkward hodgepodge of `` oh , they 're like wizards , tapping into the arcane '' and `` bending reality through music/performance '' , and to me that ruins the class . 
  and for 6 years , too . 
  wow . 
  say what you will about / u/wimmywam , but they 're a long-time active user of this subreddit and other australia-related subreddits .
