   if you 're writing in jazz/pop lead sheet style , just write it as a slash chord . 
  d/f # or d/a . 
  oh , that 's what those mean i always thought it was saying it 's ambiguous between these two chords !, 
  i 'm just curious , if you 're playing online , why ask in a city-specific subreddit ? 
  would n't it be better to post on lfg or r20 or something ? 
  yeah , korean lacks an `` er '' sound , and basically ( this is n't * quite * true , but pretty much is ) requires every syllable be at most `` consonant , vowel , consonant '' , no bleeding from one consonant into another ( i do n't know the technical linguistic term , but like what you do in `` consonant '' with the nt ) . 
  then it would be a completely different show , and you may as well ask what i 'd it were a superman show , or a yogi bear one . 
  they were explaining it for those of us who do n't call it that . 
  oh thanks . 
  i was also thinking slashdot . 
  plus , even when i read the first half of your comment , i was wondering `` what does escaping a full stop have to do with anything ? '', 
  i was under the impression that pagan is a very broad term , encompassing a wide range of beliefs , mostly non-judeo-christian beliefs found in europe after christianity had really taken hold . 
  i 've mostly seen it applied to the norse mythology . 
  but i 'm not sure that 's what op 's on about . 
  phone . 
  i rely heavily on autocorrect and prediction when typing on my phone , but sometimes it fails me without my noticing . 
  assignments return the value being assigned . 
  if it 's returning an integer , that means unless the value is exactly 0 , it will always be evaluated as `` true '' in a boolean evaluation . 
  damn , those are some very specific predictions . 
  14 hours `` did he call it right '' ? 
  it was accidentally misapplied here ( which has been corrected ) , but the `` epic '' flair is for really , really long stories shared in one big hit . 
  there are n't a lot of them , [ you can see the complete collection here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3aepic ) . 
  well it does , apparently , use the most upvoted posts of all time , so there 's something to be said for this . 
  in terms of balance , the best place to get non wotc published material that 's really well designed and balanced is at / r/boh5e . 
  in most cases it 's going to be higher quality than even wotc 's unearthed arcana articles . 
  not precisely , no . 
  we 've never seen anything that flirts with the boundaries of epic and long . 
  if it takes more than 10 minutes to read , that 's definitely epic . 
  huh ? 
  it works great for alarms . 
  it 's probably the thing i use it most for . 
   so for students that are finishing this may or before , the requirements for cas were 150 hours , with around 50 hours in each of the c , a , and s areas . 
  this has n't been true since * at the latest * exams for may 2011 . 
  the ranger has featured in at least 4 uas , to my knowledge . 
  the first was the spell-less ranger in modifying classes . 
  then they did the so-called `` ambuscade '' ranger , which was a complete ground-up rebuild of the concept of ranger -- they gave us the first 5 levels of that . 
  then they did an underdark subclass for the phb ranger in light , dark , underdark . 
  and then finally , the tweaked version of the phb ranger with both the phb subclasses and an underdark one , designed to be pretty much the same as the phb one , but balanced better . 
  well , this is certainly a surprise . 
  with no less than three possible expected options , they come out and throw something nobody ever expected at us . 
  very nicely played , wizards . 
   how are they better at magic items than a rich wizard ? 
  that 's like asking why is a wizard better at spells than an eldritch knight . 
  ** of course ** the artificer is going to be better than the wizard at the ** one thing it 's literally all about doing ** . 
  how much sleep are you getting ? 
  i 've turned off my alarms in my sleep a couple of times , but always as a result of getting far too little sleep . 
  lol, 
  pineapple is the ** god ** of fruits . 
  easily up there in my top three favourite fruits . 
  but it should ** never ** , under ** any ** circumstances , be mixed with things apart from other fruits . 
  pineapple pizza is an abomination that should be punishable by death . 
  and do n't even get me started on sweet and sour sauces . 
  somewhat annoying that even in metric mode it gives energy in calories , rather than kilojoules . 
  in general . 
  pineapple in things is an abomination , be it pizza , sweet and sour , or a cake . 
  the expression is low-hanging fruit , but i agree completely . 
  this is n't very clever or funny , it 's just taking a lazy and obvious pot-shot . 
  even if the target of said pot-shot deserves it , does n't make this good satire . 
  you say that like it 's someone we should already know ... 
  may i ask what 's wrong with [ this one ] ( http://www.world-of-songwriting.com/image-files/circle-of-fifths.jpg ) ? 
  it has the exact same amount of information , but presented in a * much * nicer way -- particularly in that its staves have a clef on them , which makes things much clearer . 
  there 's also been talk recently that soundcloud is struggling financially and may not be around for too much longer . 
  there are a couple of zebra crossings in the bottom right , and i think i see one just to the left and slightly above the base of that big tower . 
  and one a little right of the centre . 
  no , we love pineapple . 
  it just does n't belong in pizza or other cooked foods like cakes and sweet & sour . 
  doing that ruins both the pineapple and the pizza . 
  it 's like chocolate . 
  delicious on its own , but you put it in a pizza or a stir fry and suddenly holy fuck everything is awful . 
  the fact that pineapple goes well with other fruits is entirely unrelated to anything . 
  huh ? 
  yards are a distance . 
  we 're talking volumes . 
  50 ml , or 0.05 l , is a * tiny * amount . 
  if you meant a cubic yard and a half , the amounts we 're talking about are no where near that . 
  we 're like 4 orders of magnitude smaller . 
  a cubic yard is over 760 litres . 
  you 'll get better feedback on this at / r/unearthedarcana . 
  i know you 're just making a joke , but honestly my experience has been that insight is far and away the most useful skill on the game . 
  maybe deception and persuasion come close . 
  i definitely prefer a mouse where possible , but just today i did some work using my laptop 's touchpad and it turned out pretty good . 
  it 's a mac though , and in my experience they are the * only * trackpads that are any good . 
  if you 're stuck with a different trackpad things may or may not be so usable, 
  interesting . 
  i have quite literally never heard someone say that before . 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  any chance you could share the art as an image ? 
  maybe someone else could take a look . 
  or even just slightly under water sand . 
  we ca n't * know * it for certain , but it 's certainly a reasonable assumption . 
  the show is , at heart , a shakespearean tragedy , after all . 
  [ plus , it 's how the original house of cards ends , of course . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  what do you count as `` passed through '' ? 
  for example , if you left the airport and stayed in a hotel for one night , is that `` visited '' , or `` passed through '' ? 
  and if you stopped over in the airport but never left it , would you count that as `` passed through '' , or leave it blank ? 
  i ask only because i found this subreddit just now since it 's trending , and i wanted to make my own list . 
  yours is the most well-thought-out i found in a quick search , so i wanted to use the same set of rules . 
  yeah a simple flair with the type of map it is would make searching fairly easy .
