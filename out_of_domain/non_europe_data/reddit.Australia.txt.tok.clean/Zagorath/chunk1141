  i think the point is that of all the `` spells '' gandalf does , it 's quite clear that you * ca n't * say he definitively does n't use * prestidigitation * / * thaumaturgy * . 
  those , and maybe * light * , are by far his most-used spells . 
  he does n't do a lot of powerful magic , but he * does * use magic quite a bit for minor flavourful effects . 
  * totally *, 
  from the video , it looks like this glass is * never * opaque . 
  it goes from transparent ( lets through * all * light ) when unlocked , to translucent ( lets through only some light -- in this case , as a blur ) when locked . 
  not really that odd . 
  heavy armour is actually a lot more nimble than usually portrayed in fantasy . 
  i tried it just now , and she just told me `` i can search that for you '' . 
  i swear , google assistant seems to have gotten * less * useful in the past few weeks than it was when i first got it ... 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as this is your second warning , in the future submissions without flair may be removed . 
  you linked to the first draft . 
  [ here 's their second draft ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/psionics_and_mystic_v2.pdf ) , which improves in some areas , but is really quite terrible in others . 
  hopefully the upcoming third draft ( which should go all the way to level 20 ) will be better . 
  not a fan of * any * prerequisites ? 
  i mean , avoiding feat chains is one thing ( and i am all in favour of that -- no feat should have a prerequisite of another feat ) , but having a prerequisite of `` can cast spells '' already exists in the phb , as does `` stat \u2265 13 '' , and `` proficiency with a thing '' . 
  for the most part , these make sense . 
  being able to snipe your spells does n't make sense if you ca n't * cast * to begin with . 
  mastering shields does n't make sense if you can barely use one effectively first . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  the first two of these are apparently a not so uncommon fad in teaching these days , from what i 've heard . 
  to * some * extent , they can even be good things -- it 's well known , for example , that explaining something to someone else is one of the best ways of reinforcing your own learning . 
  but obviously it can go too far , and it sounds like in your students ' case it has . 
  anyway , i 'm not a teacher , but my parents and a few of my friends are , so i 'll try and provide the perspective as i 've observed it from them . 
  as far as teaching goes , it seems like a pretty difficult but rewarding gig . 
  you 'll generally be more likely to get students who want to be there ( rather than having to deal with the shits that only go to school because it 's the law , and have other behavioural problems ) and are willing to work harder , but that also comes with higher expectations on the teacher to produce great results . 
  it will of course depend on the school . 
  this may perhaps be the most important factor , really , and only you can make that judgement . 
  i 'm confused . 
  what exactly are we looking at here ? 
  all i 'm seeing is a really low resolution photo of what looks like amell in a suit , not appearing to be doing anything in particular . 
  it stands for `` id est '' , which means `` that is '' . 
  not quite the same as `` in effect '' , since `` i.e. '', 
  should be used when what comes before ** is ** what comes after , i.e. , when you 're restating the exact same thing in different terms . 
  yeah this is a pretty fundamental difference . 
  it seems utterly bizarre to me that so many people seem to be saying `` in essence '' has the same meaning as `` i.e. '', 
  i do n't use safari because , frankly , it 's a terrible user experience , but was n't there something released quite recently that showed that , for one device at least , the opposite was now true ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure that is what they 're saying . 
  it looks to me like it 's `` they heard about that one case which was frivolous and easy , and then assume all of them are like that '' . 
  that makes / u/uniquehash 's comment entirely relevant . 
  go home , zefram cochrane , you 're drunk .

  daylight saving is shit . 
  there are literally ** no ** real benefits . 
  that thing about ireland happened because dublin sits 53 \u00b0 north of the equator . 
  by contrast , melbourne only sits 37 \u00b0 south of it . 
  that means the daylight is * already * ludicrously long there in the summer . 
  in brisbane , daylight currently ends at 6:45 . 
  daylight saving , if we were dumb enough to go for it , would still be relatively early , even if you choose to put value on that . 
  which , by the way , you should n't . 
  all daylight saving does is add the * perception * of more daylight . 
  it means less daylight in the morning . 
  that has negative effects for people who , for example , do exercise in the mornings . 
  it can be * dangerous * to ride in the dark , especially at the speeds a bunch of cyclists often go at . 
  and if you 're not a cyclist , well , how much does it * really * affect you ? 
  electricity is a wonderful thing , and in these advanced modern times , we can do basically anything at night that we can do in the day . 
  but if it * really * matters , why not ask your employer to shift work hours an hour earlier ? 
  or offer flexible hours . 
  because it should n't be up to the government to officially mandate that we all collectively ** lie ** about time . 
  because that 's what daylight saving is . 
  government mandated lying . 
  and , by the way , if it really matters that much to you , why would you not ask that dst be in the * winter * ? 
  that 's when it 's `` needed '' the most . 
  why would you make the daylight last even longer at the time of year when it 's * already * lasting as long as it ever will , rather than trying to eke out more daylight at the time when it 's in short supply ? 
  the answer is because it 's not built on rational thought , and it 's a fucking retarded idea . 
  but more importantly than all that wishy washy stuff above , dst comes with no objective upsides , but some extremely serious objective negatives . 
  the few days after the switch over , there are enormous spikes in road accidents , heart problems , and suicides , and a noticeable decrease in worker efficiency . 
  the communication problems you describe -- tv is one that affects the most people directly , but it can also be seriously irritating for businesses communicating across time zones -- is entirely the fault of places that * do * engage in this outdated ( at best ) practice . 
  if you think it 's annoying that you ca n't tweet during qanda , complain to nsw and vic to get them to stop with the dst bullshit . 
  because it 's * their * fault for engaging in it , not ours for refusing . 
  dst can go suck it . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i 'd rather just * not * have it at all . 
  but if we 're going to do it , it needs to be a permanent shift of the eastern seaboard ( in its entirety ) to utc +11 . 
  the biggest problem with dst is related to the switch-over . 
  it 's bad for health , for the economy , and for communications . 
  there are some small problems related to the `` extra hour '' , and that 's why i oppose it at all , but compared to the problems of the switch , that 's insignificant . 
   why the fuck would you want more time in the sun ? 
  hear , hear !, 
  and , by the way , this argument is equally valid in brisbane and even often sydney . 
  except it is n't true . 
  some studies say it saves electricity ( less lighting , yay !, 
  ) , some say it costs more electricity ( oh no , people are in their homes with their air conditioning and consumer electronics more during the heat of the day ) . 
  but regardless of which of these studies you 're looking at , they agree on one thing : the amount saved is miniscule . 
  a couple of cents per household per year , or less . 
  cut the sarcasm , mate . 
  6 -- 2 is no more hard working than 9 -- 5 , and no one implied it was . 
  it 's the exact some amount of hours , just shifted earlier . 
  so , i 'm assuming everyone here hates that music as much as me ? 
  you dropped this : ), 
   art work is not to be used , unless created entirely by yourself . 
  this is to avoid legal issues and also to focus on that this is a writing competition . 
  that seems overly strict . 
  what about art that 's licensed cc-by , or cc0 , or is otherwise permissively licensed ? 
  the rules do n't say you ca n't do that ( as the rules of many similar competitions frequently do ) , so i would fully encourage everyone to do that !, 
  in fact , they say :,
