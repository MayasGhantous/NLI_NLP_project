  the accepted homebrew nomenclature is and has always been third caster . 
  it comes down to the rules as presented in the player 's handbook , most notably on page 164 . 
  it 's ** so much ** better . 
  i 'll add life 's too short to the list of recommendations . 
  if anyone else is wondering , like i was `` why now ? 
  '' , the reason is :, 
   today is martin luther king jr. . day in the united states to commemorate dr. king around his birthday . 
  the iconic civil rights movement leader would have turned 88 years old on sunday . 
  i love this iteration of scout . 
  it could make for a * really * cool multiclass with fighter ( maybe even the scout fighter ) for a really great highly mobile martial combat -- oriented character . 
  please remember to point out how out of place the mechanical servant is as a core class feature , and suggest it be made into an archetype \u00e0 la the beastmaster !, 
   i like that they included rogue in this ua , and essentially gave us a non-magical ranger in the same ua as the actual ranger stuff, 
  duh doi !, 
  that never even occurred to me . 
  i mean , the first thing i thought of when i saw the scout was that it 'd be the perfect choice for my fighter/rogue non-magical ranger concept to take . 
  but it never occurred to me that they may have made the conscious decision to put a ranger-like rogue alongside the ranger . 
  well spotted !, 
  ooh , neat idea !, 
  the problem is that it 's a really powerful ability , and one which may not fit well with many ( i might even argue * most * ) artificer character concepts . 
  if it were a minor mostly flavourful bonus , that would be one thing , but this is * more * powerful than the beast the phb beastmaster ranger gets by a long way . 
  so unless your artificer concept needs to have a mechanical companion , you 're stuck either making a major compromise on the flavour of your concept , or an * enormous * mechanical compromise by ignoring a huge class feature . 
  making it a subclass solves that entirely . 
  it lets people who want to have their character based around a significant mechanical companion have that ( as well as the rest of the base class features ) , while people who * do n't * want that are n't saddled with it . 
  as / u/the-magic-sword said , it also breaks one of the fundamental rules of class design , which is that each class has one or two main defining features ( barbarian 's rage , rogue 's sneak attack , paladin 's smite , etc. 
  ) , and a bunch of smaller ones . 
  the artificer currently gets wondrous invention , mechanical servant , and either the alchemy or the gun , all of which are very significant parts of its design , and it 's hard to pick out a defining one . 
  lord of the rings did it for me . 
  so , important questions : male or female ? 
  who 'd you romance ? 
  left handed with a quill ? 
  * daym * that 's some dedication . 
  i 'm left handed , but i taught myself to write ( very slowly ) with my right hand for the sole purpose of not smudging with quills and fountain pens , on the rare occasions i feel the need to write fancy-like . 
  eh , i doubt that 's a huge concern . 
  the artificer as a class concept does n't fit in all worlds . 
  perhaps most notably , as it 's the one wizards most strongly supports these days , it does n't fit in the forgotten realms . 
  it 's designed for magitek or magipunk worlds , like eberron . 
  a world where the artificer makes sense is probably also a world where the mechanical servant makes sense . 
  personally , my objections come from an individual * character * concept standpoint . 
  op mentioned it . 
  the more condensed defences system , as well as the idea of attacks `` targetting '' a different save , are a couple of things from 4e that i * really * wish 5e had adopted . 
  the game seriously loses out because so much stuff has to target ac when that does n't always make the best sense . 
   i killed ashley cause i hated how she sounded, 
  good . 
  racist bitch . 
  [ this was . 
  ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 266dd7/owning _ a_ballista / ), 
  edit : and if you did n't already know that , that makes [ this conversation ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 57bcgd/can _ some_one_explain_this_policy_to_me_really_not / d8qxjq9 / ? context = 4 ) so much more hilarious . 
  oh good , i 'm not going crazy . 
  i was just wondering the same thing . 
  i do n't see rests of any kind mentioned anywhere in ancient fortitude , despite clicking the link both from the article on their website and directly from / u/wybenga 's comment , and making sure to refresh the page . 
  [ here is the screenshot i just took ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehyt3uo.png ) . 
  nothing there about limitations . 
  it 's a really bizarre choice , admittedly , but there 's nothing particularly wrong about it . 
  you get karma from self posts now as well , so the image does n't help there . 
  besides , op has been on reddit 3 years and has a combined karma score less than 500 . 
  i highly doubt karma is one of their top priorities . 
  a necromantic sorcerer would be an awesome class for a vryloka to play , too !, 
  i 'm not american . 
  nah , you 're fine mate . 
  in the future , pages that get removed by automod can be submitted instead by linking to them inside of a self post or a `` text post '' , as some parts of the reddit ui call them ) . 
  but using the image is okay too . 
  a little unorthodox , but not breaking any rules . 
  i read people in the / r/dndnext thread claiming that , but i 've refreshed and clicked links from all different sources , and the image op linked looks exactly the same as the pdf i 'm getting off of wizards ' website . 
  yeah it looks like their servers are having problems propagating the changes , because that 's * definitely * not appearing on mine . 
   wotc still ai n't gon na give the ranger class a low/no-magic option, 
  they already have , in [ modifying classes ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/modifying-classes ) . 
  also , to a lesser extent , with the [ scout fighter ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/04_ua_classics_revisited.pdf ) . 
  and , [ as was noted by some ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 5ocbqu/ua _ ranger_and_rogue / dci8iot / ) in the / r/dndnext thread , the fact that the scout rogue is in this article is likely no coincidence . 
  it 's intended as a type of non-magical ranger . 
  not that that helps you with al. 
  i think al is pretty terrible overall . 
  i nice gateway drug , but nothing more , and not good for long-term play . 
  all three of these non-magical ranger-like options are illegal for al play , because they 're ua articles . 
   they 're built more to handle heat than cold, 
  more importantly , they 're built to handle heat * in a time without air conditioning * . 
  if it 's hot enough that opening some windows and turning on the fan is sufficient , a nice queenslander is perfect . 
  but if you really need that a/c because it 's so blisteringly hot , you 're just as out of luck as you would be in winter . 
  like i said , i made sure it was refreshing the page . 
  the issue is clearly at their end . 
  just tested it by loading it over https ( which means the isp * ca n't * cache it ) , and it 's still not loading any changes . 
  the problem has to be with the server serving up the pdf . 
  thanks mate . 
  i know how browsers work . 
  this is ( or was , i 'm on my phone right now and maybe it 's been fixed since ) a problem on their end . 
  i even tried it on a completely different browser , to be sure . 
  wotc 's cdn seems most likely to me . 
  ca n't be isp because i tried connecting over https as well and still has the problem . 
  but yeah , it 's showing up with the new version for me now , too . 
  only if you 're a straight white male . 
  during the airing of season one . 
  christmas break , probably . 
  i was on a plane home from a holiday with my parents , and i saw on the in-flight entertainment system a show called arrow , showing a guy wearing green . 
  now , at this point , the only dc i had seriously watched was young justice . 
  i 'd obviously seen some batman cartoons and justice league as a kid , and the nolan movies of course , but the only time i had seriously sat down and decided to watch a dc property was yj , which was also currently still airing at the time , i believe . 
  anyway , green arrow being such a pivotal character in that show , i thought it could be really cool to see a live action show about the guy . 
  i did n't start watching it until quite late in the flight , so i think i only got through 4 or 5 and a half episodes before i had to stop , but by that point i was hooked . 
  as soon as i got home i downloaded the rest , and i 've been watching every show in that universe ever since . 
   and thus even less tested, 
  actually , not really .
