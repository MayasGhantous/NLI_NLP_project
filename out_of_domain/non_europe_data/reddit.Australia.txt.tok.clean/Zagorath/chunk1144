  in most cases , probably equally untested , but in some rare cases , / r/unearthedarcana content may be * more * tested than the unearthed arcana articles . 
  yeah , maybe . 
  the way it 's set up now , it definitely looks like the subclasses are meant to provide a much greater percentage of the overall power of the artificer than they are in other classes , so perhaps some more buffs to those abilities would be in order . 
  oooh yeah , magical secrets could be an awesome ability for an artificer to have . 
  wish you 'd mentioned that before i did the survey !, 
   to pair ( for a pretty abysmal result tbh ) with repelling blast, 
  i found it to be an immensely effective pairing , actually . 
  that also explains why the l is silent . 
   if an enemy moves next to the player with the intention of attacking , can the player use their reaction to move away before being attacked ? 
  that 's what i thought at the time i made my last comment , but no . 
  you can only use it when the enemy * ends * their turn next to you . 
  that 's after they 've had the chance to make their attack . 
  you do n't happen to have the autoscroll extension installed , do you ? 
   and probably the most balanced news source in the country . 
  i 'm not british , but is this a controversial statement in the uk ? 
  i would put the bbc up there as possibly the most balanced tv news source in the * world * . 
  the only tv news that rivals it , from what i 've seen , is the abc , which is deliberately modelled after the beeb -- though in our case , it 's truly free , insofar as something paid for through general taxation can be said to be free . 
  i do n't know much about canada or new zealand 's national broadcasters , they might also be the sam calibre . 
  you have to own a tv set , and pay for the electricity to run it , obviously , but in australia tv is free . 
  the abc is funded through general taxation , so if you count that as not free , then i guess it 's not , but you 'd be paying for that even if you do n't own a tv . 
  that said , i 'm out of the country now and apparently this season of sherlock did n't show on free to air tv at all . 
  it aired on stan , which is a local netflix competitor . 
  so while there * is * tv for free , sherlock is n't on it . 
  sitcoms and procedurals ( police , doctors , etc. ), 
  are still largely single episodes . 
  they 'll usually have * some * larger continuity , but it 's often a background element just there to keep things from getting * too * same-y . 
  cue , not queue . 
  though i 'd be more inclined to just use the word `` foreshadowing '' , even if it did n't end up being that . 
   if one section does not line up with their experience with the drug ( in this case ) they will write off everything you have said, 
  i have heard that this is why the american anti-drug education programme , dare , failed . 
  the programme painted all drugs with the same extremely harsh brush , but students knew and had seen how relatively tame marijuana was , which lead them to disregard all the true stuff they were being taught about more dangerous drugs . 
  oh fuck yes . 
  i think gambling ads should go the way of the cigarette ad , but if that 's not on the table , having the commentators transition in to the sponsor like that is fucking disgusting . 
  well fuck me . 
  yeah i 've played the game before and always thought that it 's just really a game that does n't work if you 're not american . 
  far too many specific cultural references . 
  the whole game kinda fell flat . 
  in addition to this , you are very , ** very ** rarely going to be called out for using `` who '' when `` whom '' would be more appropriate . 
  if you 're in any doubt whatsoever about which to use , just go with `` who '' . 
  it 's not going to matter . 
  using `` who '' instead of `` whom '' is normal . 
  doing the reverse can come across as uneducated at best , and pretentious despite that at worst . 
   which only hurts the employee, 
  that 's exactly what at-will employment is * designed * to do . 
  no we did not . 
   ** article 4 ** -- the treaty does not recognise , dispute , nor establish territorial sovereignty claims ; no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force ;, 
  since we already had the claim * prior * to the signing of the treaty , and the treaty explicitly does not make claims invalid , australia 's antarctic claim is entirely valid , regardless of whether or not it is recognised . 
  most of the world does n't recognise taiwan as an independent nation , either , but that does n't make it any less of a fact that it * is * one . 
  hmm , looks like someone downvoted you ( you 're sitting at 1 now , after my upvote ) , so i guess you were right to be wary . 
  huh ? 
  it 's 24 crotchets per minute . 
  4 crotchets per bar . 
  that 's one crotchet every 2.5 seconds , or 10 seconds per bar . 
  more likely 2 beats per crotchet , since the melody is n't in triplets . 
  eastier for the violists to work out where their triplets fit around the quaver rhythm than it is for first and second violins to be given triplets and work out where their quavers and semiquavers fit in to that . 
  i love the actor , and the way he 's written/directed is so hilariously fun that it 's just so awesome . 
  but i ca n't help but think , every time he 's on screen , that he 's actually * really bad * at his job . 
  it kinda undermines him , to be honest . 
  i know it 's just because we often see him going up against characters that need to be alive at the end , so he * ca n't * be shown succeeding , but still . 
  more often often than not , he goes storming in making a big fuss , but his target does n't end up dead . 
  not nearly the effective killer on screen that his reputation is supposed to imply . 
  still awesome though and i thoroughly enjoy every moment he 's on screen . 
  oh , right . 
  that also makes sense . 
  the line we 're assuming is celli also has `` unis . 
  arco '' written above it , which is an instruction that also makes sense for strings , which lends further credence to the idea that this is , indeed , the strong section , just in case there was any lingering doubt . 
  the thing is , the violi are n't the ones that really matter . 
  they 're just filling out the harmony and providing some texture . 
  the melody and countermelody are in the violins . 
  and they are both playing rhythms with quavers and semiquavers . 
  if you were going to subdivide it to make things easier to follow , they 're the most important bit , and they 're the ones who it would he semantically correct to give the beat . 
  that makes it subdivisions of 2 or 4 , but the more you subdivide it , the harder it is to correctly feel the pulse ( which is still 24 * crotchets * per minute , not 48 quavers and definitely not 96 semiquavers ) , and going with 2 still makes it feel a very slow rhythm , while beating 4 at 96 makes it feel much faster . 
  so 2 is the logical choice . 
  yeah , he 's obviously * meant * to be good at his job , in-universe , and we can probably assume that he has heaps of hits that we do n't see and they go just fine . 
  it 's just funny that whenever he 's on screen , he 's failing . 
  red rooster is amazing , but it 's not fried chicken . 
  make sure you have the chips , they are to * die * for . 
  i 've never heard of chicken treat before , so ca n't comment . 
   the key is to spread it very thinly, 
  i mean , that 's a good way to give it to someone who 's never had it before ( also lather the toast in butter/margarine ) , but that 's not the typical australian way of eating it . 
  we most often like it slathered on good and thick . 
  well , you are , it seems . 
  i have had software incorrectly read it in the past , for some reason . 
  the steam in-game overlay , specifically . 
  the light was off , but it was treating caps-lock as on , and when i hit caps lock the light went on , but it treated it as off . 
  alt-tab out and everything else is working correctly . 
  alt-tab back in and now steam is using it correctly as well . 
  i 've had even weirder , where the os and most applications were reading it incorrectly , but * one specific application * read it wrong . 
  if i did that i 'd have music randomly start playing at annoying times . 
  that 's honestly * worse * than accidental all-caps . 
  fuck , i did n't notice what subreddit this was on at first and just about did a spit take . 
  you 're probably right , but i 'll just speak in defence of the cymbals . 
  they can be very effective at evoking a certain timbre , even at piano . 
  could also be something more exotic like a gong or unpitched bell . 
  but triangle is definitely the most likely . 
  i ca n't comment on the more recent slate of movies , but pirates of silicon valley , which came out in 1999 , is absolutely worth watching . 
   but be forewarned it 's generally considered one of the weaker mechanics, 
  what ? 
  everything i 've seen suggests that they were an awesome mechanic , just frequently poorly * utilised * .
