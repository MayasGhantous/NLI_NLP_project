  hey , just so you 're aware , i 'm re-flairing this as `` adventure '' . 
  the `` event '' tag is for submissions related to subreddit events , like officially-run competitions . 
  myers-briggs and hogwarts house might work that way , but your horoscope is literally just the month ( or year , if you prefer the chinese zodiac ) you were born in , so it 's useless for gauging self-perception . 
  i do n't know if that 's true or not , but i * do * know that the health benefits of cycling out way , on average , the dangers associated with it . 
  there 's always the possibility of you being the one who dies or gets in a serious accident , but that 's rare enough that , on average , regular cyclists live longer than non-cyclists . 
  yeah definitely leave them out . 
  they 're homebrew , the same as anything you 'd find at / r/unearthedarcana . 
  the only difference is that the people who made it happen to work at the same rather large company that makes the real thing . 
   in 5e , i ca n't think of a single instance where piercing over bludgeoning matters so just consider it all fluff, 
  there are a few , but not many . 
  skeletons are vulnerable to bludgeoning , and rakshasas are vulnerable to piercing attacks from magic weapons if the wielder is good . 
  probably a couple of other examples out there . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  the controls and mic that come with most earphones these days is almost universally on the * right * earbud 's cord . 
  that 's how i tell which is which . 
  yeah , this sub can be pretty terrible sometimes about enforcing the `` no spoilers in titles '' rule . 
   the exception that proves the rule, 
  you 're using that phrase wrong . 
  there 's no reason that a numerical representation of dates should be in the same order as when you say things . 
  the only thing that makes sense is to go from most significant to least significant , or vice versa . 
  you 're right , of course , and celebrating tau day is possible a lot earlier , too . 
  tai is terrible , because it has no simple relationship with the times that people actually use . 
  with utc , it 's just `` add x number of hours '' to find the time in your time zone . 
  tai is `` add x number of hours , and then subtract 37 seconds ( currently , will change over time , so you better keep track ) '' . 
  when they said `` preteen '' , i just interpreted as using that word 's etymological meaning , as in literally `` pre ten '' . 
   all you need is a light jacket, 
  that sounds like `` too cold '' to me . 
  shorts and a t-shirt or bust . 
  everyone 's responding to you as though you 've just done some coding involving time zones . 
  but here i was thinking you 'd returned from a holiday in new zealand or something ... 
   like make a martial mace, 
  you mean like the morningstar ? 
  or even the flail , if you reflavour it to remove the chain . 
  but anyway , you 've missed the point . 
  op is n't asking what new stuff you want them to make , but what stuff that 's been in ua before that you want improved versions of . 
  cheers !, 
  i understand why you would want that , but to be honest i do n't think it would be enormously helpful . 
  it 's far better to simply have subreddit rules in spoiler-sensitive subs to disallow titles that contain spoilers . 
  the reason is that without reading the title , * you do n't know * what the spoiler is . 
  it could be about the latest episode of the show , which you might think is fine if you 're up to date , but it could also be speculation or known facts about the * future * of whatever franchise , based on behind the scenes sneak peaks , trailers , etc. 
  if spoilers are allowed in the title itself , because they can be hidden from people who do n't want to see them , you might read the title thinking you 're fine , since you 're up to date , and end up being spoiled anyway . 
  the phrase requires that there be an implied statement that the exception * is * an exception . 
  for example , `` parking is permitted between the hours of 1800 and 0600 '' carries an implicit statement that parking is not permitted from 0600 to 1800 . 
  there is n't necessarily an implicit statement of the opposite when saying `` 4th of july '' . 
  if it were phrased as `` americans do use the ` nth of month ' format , when referring to the ' 4th of july ' '' , that would be an example of the exception proving the rule ... 
  and it 's at this point in my train of thought that i realised you 're right . 
  but i 'm leaving the rest of the comment in , to demonstrate my mistake . 
  does the french keyboard also have the apostrophe on the main keyboard ? 
  'cause they do the same thing . 
  how is this `` no spoiler '' ? 
  edit : mods fixed it . 
  it 's a future spoiler . 
  hy , would you mind cross-posting this to / r/unearthedarcana ? 
  it 's an awesome idea , and i 'd love to see what a wider audience thinks of it mechanically . 
  / r/threadkillers, 
   there is a liberal coalition majority in the senate, 
  not really . 
  not on social issues , anyway . 
  labor , greens , xenophon , and ( as much as i despise the party in general ) liberal democrats together hold 39 seats out of 76 ( including two current vacancies ) . 
  that 's a majority . 
  the real problem is a coalition majority in the * reps * , many of whom said they would refuse to support marriage equality even if the plebiscite was found to be in favour . 
  but the game 's not balanced around that , so it 's pointless . 
  it displays fine for me . 
  what browser and platform are you on ? 
  hmm , weird . 
  made sure it 's not zoomed in at all , and you do n't have any custom font-related settings ( including accessibility options ) ? 
   any undead that keep their memories and personality after death ( vampire ... ), 
  and yet she , through the red witch ( which may be an exarch , an avatar , or another aspect of the raven queen ) , is responsible for creating the vryloka , a race that sits in a weird grey area between living and vampiric undeath . 
  those in the second group , if they did n't * also * believe the arguments of the first group , would autonomously * choose * to get vaccinated anyway . 
  [ here is the comment thread from the last time this was submitted ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2178uv/the _ allbarbarian_journey / ) , if anyone is interested . 
  it was a * long * time ago , though , and did not receive an enormous amount of attention . 
  oh no worries . 
  as i said , it was a long time ago and the sub has grown a lot since then . 
  another thing you can do with consumption taxes is have them be relatively high , but also really * narrow * . 
  we obviously already exclude a lot of important basics , but we could add things like electricity , telecommunications services , and basic forms of transportation ( public transport , bikes , and low-end cars , and the goods & services needed to support those ) to the list of exclusions . 
  it 's worrying to me that i * usually * hear `` increase and broadening '' in the same sentence , when a fairer thing to do would be an increase and narrowing , in my eyes . 
  the fact that they protect whistle blowing on unions would also imply it 's * not * labor politicians ( assuming / u/algernop3 's premise is correct -- i have no idea one way or the other if it is ) who wrote these laws . 
  sure , i 'm open to that . 
  would you explain ? 
  you dropped one of these : ` \\ `, 
  it 's a variant subclass for paladins . 
  every paladin picks a subclass ( an `` oath '' ) at 3rd level , which gives them abilities at certain levels . 
  if you 're interested in d&d 5e , the [ basic rules ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules ) ( for both players and dms ) are available for free off of the wizards website , and some more races and classes etc. 
  are available ( in a less fancy format ) in the [ 5e srd ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd ) . 
  if you 're interested in homebrew stuff , / r/boh5e has a fantastic collection of some of the absolute best , highest quality stuff available . 
  just in case anyone is wondering , hu\u1ebf is pronounced like `` hway '' , as in the regular english word `` way '' with an `` h '' in front of it , and not like the term `` hue '' relating to colours . 
   i dunno what i 'm doing but i 'm dropping / / / / / all over the place, 
  you need to be using * back * slashes , ` \\ ` , not forward slashes , ` / ` . 
  the reason is that the backslash acts as an `` escape '' character . 
  it tells reddit to look at the character that comes after the slash , and treat it as * that character * , instead of being a part of the reddit syntax . 
  for example \\* there 's a backslash before these asterisks \\* , to make reddit draw the asterisks there , instead of making it italic . 
  \\  gets used for blockquotes normally , so by escaping it ( putting a backslash before it ) , you instead draw the '  ' literally . 
   mechanically speaking , the expanded crit belongs to the fighter class, 
  i think that 's reasonable feedback to give to someone making player-facing homebrew , but not monsters . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , any mechanic in the game is `` fair game '' ( so to speak ) for monster building , as long as it thematically makes sense for the monster , and keeps the balance appropriate . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  no you 're not .
