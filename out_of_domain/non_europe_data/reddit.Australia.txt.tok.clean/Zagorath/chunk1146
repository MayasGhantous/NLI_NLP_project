  ingress players are a fun bunch , on the whole , so this sort of over-the-top jokey portal title is quite common . 
  this is n't an argument !, 
  it 's just contradiction !, 
  and , more importantly , the ideology most often meant when just saying `` libertarian '' is right-libertarian . 
  that 's what leyonhjem is . 
  this is why the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) is such a great concept . 
  most mainstream `` left/right '' politics happens about the line y = x. 
  libertarians , in the sense the word is usually used , exist in the bottom right . 
  first of all , really ? 
  there 's gon na be an emoji movie ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  and sir patrick is going to be in it ? 
  second , the convention is actually to address someone by either their first name , or their full name , when knighted . 
  sir patrick , or sir patrick stewart . 
  but never sir stewart . 
  it 's on netflix . 
  much more convenient than a tv station . 
  i 'll be honest , i was surprised it was n't already in there , too . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  coherent , but it definitely still felt like a campaign speech rather than a presidential one . 
  like if someone with the exact some policies as trump , but less egotistical and a better public speaker , was running for office . 
  yeah it 's pretty amazing . 
  i first saw this when it was at ~ 700 upvotes , and i checked the subreddit 's / top , and it was already by far the highest upvoted thing / r/tng has ever had . 
  now it 's sitting at 22k , over 6 and two thirds times as many upvotes as the entire subscriber base of the subreddit . 
  in case you 're not already aware , there 's going to be another one later this year !, 
  part of the original timeline , too , not that jjverse crap . 
  if you 're outside america , it 'll be on netflix . 
  around june , i think ? 
  not sure who 's showing it in the us . 
   than he would enjoy the personal recognition and fame, 
  i think to make a fair comparison , we have to assume it 's not * him * he 's deciding whether or not to vote on , but one of * his * heroes . 
  he 'd probably still downvote , though . 
  i have n't listened to the rest of the podcast yet , but i did listen to that segment a few hours ago . 
  absolutely fantastic . 
  probably the best sage advice segment they 've had on the podcast . 
  but they did n't answer the one real question that i had . 
  can you twin spell * eldritch blast * if you 're under level 5 ? 
  * at this point * it 's impossible to target more than one person , even if later , it 's not ? 
  on a similar but slightly different note , can you twin spell something like * fly * , if you cast it with a 3rd level spell slot ? 
  it 's possible to target more than one person with it , but * only if you use a higher spell slot * , which is a very different concept to a spell like * fireball * or * sleep * , where no matter how you cast them , they * always * have the potential to affect more than one target . 
  you 're right that the mm ( not dmg , as far as i recall ) rules are absolutely ridiculous . 
  they 're intended to be a temporary curse placed upon a player , not a permanent part of player progression . 
  the [ vampire prestige class ] ( https://redd.it/49mnbi ) is not only the best way of playing a vampire in 5e , but it 's quite possibly the single best bit of homebrew available for the whole system . 
  it allows them to get the full experience of being a vampire , but in a balanced way , as it requires them to multiclass to get these powers , instead of progressing in their same class . 
  one level gets them mostly all the important fluff about vampirism , but more levels are needed for some of the more iconic * powerful * things vampires do . 
  another option might be to play a vryloka . 
  they 're a race that was created in 4e that 's very vampire-like , but not * quite * technically vampires . 
  you can find a pretty good 5e version of them [ here ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) , replete with enough lore about them to get a good feel for it as intended . 
  though you could always just reflavour it as a true vampire , if you wanted . 
  it has notes on the design and balance of the race on the final page . 
  there * is * a certain truth to the idea that music is a universal language . 
  it 's not a coincidence that complex musical tastes developed in virtually every culture around the world . 
  an appreciation for rhythm , at the very least , lies deep within human 's dna . 
  but obviously , it 's a massive oversimplification to the point of being a useless triviality . 
  in studying music , my classmates and my initial reaction to most new cultures ' music in studying world music was usually a fairly negative one . 
  when you 're brought up on western pop music , and 90 % of what you study is western art music , hindustani classical music , or gamelan , or western african music sounds very bizarre and foreign to you , and that makes it sound ` bad ' . 
  in most cases , an open mind and some more exposure can bring you to like any of these styles of music , and with study you can understand some of the cultural implications of it , but it 's certainly far from easily universally translatable . 
  for a * truly * universal language , you need mathematics , because that is a truly * univers * al form of communication . 
  it 's just very limited in what it can communicate . 
  there 's also the fact that these are the same types of people who complain about the idea of `` safe spaces '' when it 's not them . 
  the other is encouraging sexual assault . 
  not even just markdown . 
  it 's literally the entire internet , because html does n't recognise more than one space in a row , unless written using some sort of html entity like \\ & nbsp ; ( which , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; by the & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; way , reddit/markdown & nbsp ; also recognises ) . 
  html was designed with sensible rules for spacing in mind . 
  none of this double space bullshit . 
  some bb clarinets come with an extra key that allows them to reach a low eb , to get parity with the a clarinet 's low range . 
   ** unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit **, 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support or anything related to it . 
  additionally , this is a subreddit exclusively for 5e and system neutral content . 
  i 'm removing this post . 
  it 's astonishing to me that this is even possible . 
  the idea of allowing state governments to choose how the boundaries are drawn is asinine . 
  in australia we have an independent federal organisation responsible for everything relating to running elections , including drawing electorate boundaries . 
  there 's never been any serious talk about gerrymandering in our federal politics in my lifetime . 
  i do n't know about the other ones , but skyrim has [ a really good alternate intro mod ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/ ? ), 
  that gives you a bunch of other starting options , most of which are really quick to throw you into the main game , and which come with their own minor quests . 
  why is / r/startrekgifs trending , rather than / r/tng , which is the sub that had a post reach the front page yesterday ? 
  i ca n't even see anything in startrekgifs that got a particularly large amount of attention . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
   they do n't channel their patron 's powers, 
  canonically , in the forgotten realms , this is not true . 
  in any novel with a warlock character , they 're described very specifically as `` channeling '' their patron 's powers . 
  that 's the exact word used . 
  `` channel the powers of the hells '' is not an uncommon phrase . 
  i 'd also say , you 'd have to be a really fuckin ' desperate character at the time you made your pact to give up your soul in payment . 
  in a universe where you * know * the soul is real and eternal , it 's not something you 'll give up easily . 
  maybe if you did it to save the lives of your loved ones or village or something , but normally it 'd be stupid . 
  so the patron probably has some * other * motive for forming the pact . 
  maybe they ask for some favours occasionally ( this seems to be the most common ) , maybe they 're a collector and the warlock is a valuable part of whatever that collection is , maybe something else . 
  some people like collecting rare things . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that , if it 's what they want to do . 
  oh right . 
  i misread op 's post .
