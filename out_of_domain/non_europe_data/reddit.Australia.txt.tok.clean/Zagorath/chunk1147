  i thought they were * offering * someone $ 200 for it . 
  i hope it 's neither . 
  i * already * accidentally hit the edge of the screen way too often . 
  remove the bezels any further and things can only get worse . 
  from my point of view , this push towards bezelless designs is the new equivalent of the push towards paper-thin phones . 
  form being considered ahead of function . 
  i 've temporarily removed this post , for your safety . 
  you linked to the `` edit '' page , rather than the `` share '' page , which means anyone who accessed the link could have edited it . 
  change the link to the share page , and i 'll re-appove this . 
  cool , approved . 
  it should be visible now . 
  only worth getting rid of if a superior replacement is available . 
  wireless is a pain . 
  you get lower audio quality , audio drop-outs , and most importantly , you ca n't easily switch your earphones between multiple devices , and you have to worry about keeping * yet another thing * charged . 
  oh , and also since it 's wireless , no using them on aeroplanes during take-off and landing . 
  usb-c ( or apple 's lightning , in the case of iphones ) offers marginally better audio quality in theory , but that still relies on the earphones themselves being higher quality . 
  and outside of maybe the most extreme of audiophiles , 3.5 mm already offers easily sufficient audio quality , with a good pair of earphones . 
  usb-c also means no charging while listening . 
  if there was a sufficient replacement to 3.5 mm headphones , then by all means , we should embrace it . 
  but there is n't one right now . 
  the show puts forward a ** very ** strong message of equality and progressiveness . 
  virtually no one who watches it is going to be upset by this . 
  the wider comic book community , maybe , but not the show 's audience . 
  i 've seen other people say it 's weaker than just going with a * battlemaster * and having proficiency with firearms . 
  but i 've not verified that myself , because i do n't have any personal interest in gunslingers . 
  ninety nine thousand , nine hundred and ninety nine per cent of people ? 
  wow , that 's a ** lot ** . 
  in what language ? 
  according to google , they 're an npc in the dark souls universe . 
  mine ( fourth biggest uni in australia ) blocked it for on-campus residents . 
  i * think * that their official reason was something to do with having 17 year olds on campus . 
  anyway , they never made even the slightest attempt to stop anyone circumventing it , and they also had set up a peer-to-peer file transferring service for on-campus residents , for ... uhh ... sharing study resources and stuff ( so they said , with a knowing wink ) . 
  point being , in my case i 'm pretty sure its was doing what they were told by higher ups , but reluctantly , and with the minimum of effort needed to technically satisfy the requirements . 
   the hell half-baked school does that ? 
  one with an exclusivity clause in their contract with microsoft , perhaps ? 
  i dunno ... seems really shitty . 
  grey usually represents `` no/insufficient data '' , which , given where it is , seems to mostly make sense . 
  red , i 'm guessing , uses some number system other than the hindu-arabic system used in most of the world . 
  probably an older form of arabic numerals . 
   more accurate eta, 
  it 's * scary * how accurate google 's etas are . 
  i regularly find i have 40 + minute journeys where google is within about 2 minutes of the correct time . 
   double-tap-hold-and-swipe to zoom, 
  holy shit . 
  how did i not know this was a thing . 
  this is ** amazing !!, 
  i do n't think they 're that disparate . 
  i 'm in both groups . 
  i fucking hate smoking , and if i see someone doing it , my default response is to dislike that person . 
  doing it in public is especially disrespectful to all the other people around you . 
  but it 's a personal choice , and as much as i hate the action itself , i believe they should have the right to do it . 
  i feel exactly the same way about marijuana . 
  it should be legal , regulated , and taxed , but i do n't want anyone doing it around me . 
   we living with her economic screwup everyday in australia, 
  well , her and reagan . 
  but at least the majority of poms are ashamed about their '80s leader . 
  talk to most yanks and they 'll still think reagan was a great idea . 
  holy shit . 
  it works in chrome too . 
  how am i only just discovering this now, 
  / r/boh5e for sure . 
  it 's a sub where dedicated experienced reviewers look at homebrew submitted to them and give in-depth reviews about what it did well and what it did poorly , and why . 
  it 's a fairly wide variety of stuff , since it 's not a single creator or team of creators , and instead anyone can submit something , but it 'll only be accepted if it 's particularly high quality . 
   ## post requirements, 
  content must be 5th edition specific or system agnostic . 
  well , [ according to leonard bernstein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyy1gv8jhu ) , ** beethoven ** was a master of ** form ** . 
  and that 's probably largely true , but many of bernstein 's arguments are n't particularly well expressed , [ as explained in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjct5m8jzl4 ) . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5oaqfg/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5oaqfg/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  just so you 're aware , \\ & nbsp ; inserts a `` no break space '' . 
  this is useful for forcing it to put spaces in , yes , but its * main * & nbsp ; purpose is for putting a space between two words , but * forcing * it to keep those two words together , on the same line . 
  this can be really useful if you have a two-word proper noun or rule title , and you 'd prefer it be absolutely clear that these words go together . 
  for example , compare the above paragraph with the below copy of it . 
  at least on my screen , they 're displaying * slightly * differently , thanks to the above one including a no break space , where the lower one does not .

  edit : [ here 's a screenshot , in case it displays differently on other screens , and for on mobile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4oklmmr.png ) . 
  the difference lies at the end of the first line of both paragraphs . 
   since i removed it some months ago , i noticed that every single website i visit are defaulted to https mostly anyway , using both chrome and firefox, 
  i 'm fairly sure that this is precisely the * reason * some people may have said it 's no longer good . 
  not because it 's got bugs in it , or because the creators have gone malicious , but just because it 's a lot less useful today than it once was , since most major sites with https available these days will force secure access as a matter of course , since the computational cost of doing so is much lower now , relative to the computing power of servers and computers . 
  let 's encrypt has helped a lot more sites get ssl , but i doubt it 's doing much to make those sites * with * ssl to force an https redirect , which is what https everywhere does . 
  the extension ca n't force the server to set up a tls connection if it is n't configured to have that option , all it can do is force your browser to * ask * for tls if it 's available . 
  i was not aware of that change in chrome , however . 
  very interesting . 
  so the browser is now effectively doing on its own what https everywhere does ? 
   chrome will just flag the site as `` non-secured '', 
  oh right . 
  i was aware of that . 
  i read your comment as implying that chrome was itself forcing the connection to go over https where possible . 
  if you do n't think apple fans criticise apple , you have n't been hanging around very many apple fans lately -- especially right after announcements . 
  [ here are the comments from the last time this was submitted on this subreddit ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 3ck9pu/the _ bakers_daughter_xpost_from_rdnd / ) , in case anyone is interested . 
  what does realm works give you that a free system like [ dungeonomics ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 5l09ui/update _ dungeonomics_new_campaign_management / ) does n't ? 
  just curious , as currently i am using neither . 
  no worries . 
  it was a long time ago and the subreddit has grown since then . 
  uhh ... i did n't understand a word you just said .
