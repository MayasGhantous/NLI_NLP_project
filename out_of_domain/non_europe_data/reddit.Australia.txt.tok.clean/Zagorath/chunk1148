  you should add a flair to yourself , to make your comments more clearly created by one of the developers .

  we 've tried a bunch , but few of them stick . 
  in particular , we 've tried a bunch of things to get around two problems that are closely related :, 
  you can spend your entire turn sprinting in circles around an opponent and not provoke an opportunity attack , but somehow taking two steps back * does * . 
  flanking an enemy provides no inherent bonus . 
  we played for a long time that surrounding them grants advantage . 
  it 's a good rule , and makes more sense than * not * doing that , from a purely logical perspective . 
  but it did make advantage a little too easy to get -- and more importantly , it made it way too easy to cancel out disadvantage . 
  currently we 've playing it that flanking provides a static +2 bonus . 
  we also considered , but did n't end up running with , allowing ( dis ) advantage to stack , so flanking + something else would still be worthwhile . 
  also considered making flanking harder to do by removing the stupidity that is `` run in circles around monsters for free '' , but ultimately went with the less realistic option just to make combat run smoother . 
  for a long time , we fixed problem 1 by allowing a `` slide '' of five feet to not provoke oa . 
  if you move no more than 5 feet on your turn , even if you move out of reach of an enemy , you do n't provoke it . 
  i got rid of that rule mainly because one or two players were * constantly * getting confused by how it worked ( particularly in combination with the `` run in circles for free '' raw , which although we considered removing , we never actually did ) , no matter how many times we repeated it . 
  so currently the movement rules are by the book . 
  ooh , i ** really ** like healer 's kit dependency and slower natural healing . 
  definitely going to put those to my players to see if they like them . 
  i 'm not quite sure what your inspiration rule is . 
  are you saying you roll your initial d20 , and if you do n't like it , you can roll one more d20 and * add its total to the score * ? 
  or is it more like an `` after-the-fact advantage '' , in that you can choose to reroll and take the higher , like with the lucky feat ? 
  i 'm really more ambidextrous than left handed , by nature . 
  i 've tried doing some things that i naturally do left handed with my right hand , and after practising for a bit i can usually get okay at it . 
  but no , outside of a few select things that i do right handed : mousing , batting ( cricket and baseball , as well as golf clubs ) , and holding scissors , i never do anything with my right hand without very consciously deciding that 's what i want to do at a particular time . 
  how did victoria get public transport * so wrong * when seq did it * so well * ? 
  disengage allows you to move your * entire * movement for free . 
  it makes sense that that would require an action . 
  but moving just * barely * outside of the melee range of your attacker should not . 
  * especially * not in a world where you can already move * twice * your normal speed ( or three times , if a rogue ) and spend your entire turn literally sprinting circles around them , throwing all caution to the wind , and yet that somehow does n't provoke oa . 
  our houserule , which we gave up only because it was causing one player confusion , was effectively to allow you to spend your entire movement points to get the disengage action and have 5 ft. movement remaining . 
  yes it did , but nobody here is saying otherwise . 
  i just checked . 
  yes , that 's it . 
  i love the idea of bloodied , but personally i feel like it 's not worth using without lots of abilities that key off of it . 
  monsters that can only do things while bloodied ( or while not ) , extra player abilities that proc only when the target first becomes bloodied , etc. 
  your mark option is interesting , but it 's lacking one of the crucial aspects of marking from 4e and from wherever it was that we saw marking recently in 5e ( one of the recent uas , i think ? ) . 
  that is that it provides an incentive for the markee to only attack the marker , or for the marker to attack only the markee . 
  for example , if it caused the markee to grant the marker an oa when the marked character attacks anyone other than the marker , * that * would be a great feature . 
   shooting into combat / through creatures, 
  my group considered this rule , but we decided against it for a simple reason : it 's * trivially * abused . 
  let 's say you 're fighting against both x and y , but x is obscured by y. x 's ac is greater than or equal to y 's . 
  you can now easily get two opportunities to hit an opponent , rather than having to make a tough decision . 
  aim your attack at x. 
  if you hit them , great . 
  if you miss due to cover , however , you now hit y. 
  without this rule , in that same scenario , you have to decide : do i try for the harder shot against x , and take down the tougher bad guy first , but risk doing no damage at all , or do i go for the easy target first ? 
  with this rule , you go for the tougher guy every time , and get an extra chance at possibly hitting the weaker guy even if you miss the tough one . 
  your bonus actions rule just makes sense . 
  it seems bizarre to me that that 's not the official rule . 
  i can only assume it 's for the sake of `` simplicity '' , but they took it way too far . 
  i love your two-weapon fighting rule . 
  will be stealing it . 
  your darkvision rule is certainly very intriguing . 
  it would make low-light scenarios far more potent . 
  as it is , it 's basically possible to just ignore light most of the time , since so many players ' characters can ignore it . 
  making light a greater issue for the party is a really interesting option . 
  my only question is regarding drow and duegar . 
  they get bonuses to darkvision in exchange for some * very * severe penalties in sunlight . 
  do you let them maintain darkvision ( either their full advanced one , or let them get the smaller darkvision ) , or do you remove the sunlight penalty ? 
  or perhaps you keep the penalty ** and ** remove darkvision ( ** ouch !!, 
  yeah , these are different problems that need to be/can be dealt with in slightly different ways , so it 's important to clarify which is meant . 
  i did n't make the arrangement . 
  i just found it online and posted it on reddit . 
  not just dumb , shitty and reckless . 
  they put people -- their own customers -- in * danger * for the sake of profits . 
  this should not be forgiven or forgotten . 
  you should n't . 
  not after they put people in * danger * by rushing the turnaround on the second lot of notes and failing to do a proper safety inspection , all for a little more profit . 
  this mark makes almost no difference to balance , since it ( a ) only applies on opportunity attacks , and so very rarely comes up , and ( b ) costs a fighting style , which normally provide very significant bonuses . 
  i 've seen a lot of people complaining about how poorly twf scales . 
  this rule fixes that , nothing more . 
  i 'm confused . 
  how are these related ? 
   also do n't allow `` weapon master '' as it 's just noobtrap . 
  what if i want to play a human rogue with a longbow ? 
  i do the same , but only if the character has am obvious weak point ( like any humanoid does with their neck , but , say , a dragon does not ) , and not in combat , because in combat they are also having to watch out for other opponents and keep aware of their surroundings . 
  they 're usually put in brackets though , which imo is much better , since it makes it clear that they 're courtesy accidentals only . 
  though in some copies , i have seen brackets used for other things , like into indicate an editor 's addition ( around slurs , for example ) . 
  you do n't have to be in a party to see your stats ... 
  could you elaborate on the licensing issue ? 
  we can afford to have it , because the community is pretty respectful and , thus far , has n't taken advantage of it . 
  homebrewery uses two systems for its formatting . 
  markdown , and html . 
  markdown is what 's used on reddit , and it 's what most of homebrewery 's built in styling functions are based on . 
  ''  '' starts a blockquote , which homebrewery uses as those little ` asides ' . 
  '' * '' for bullet points , the rather complicated table syntax , etc. 
  but if you ca n't remember that , the menu options it has do it all for you . 
  but it also allows arbitrary html , which means you can customise everything * exactly * how you want it . 
  you can use their built-in `` add vertical space '' option , but then change the size of that space by adjusting the ` margin-top ` value . 
  you can place a picture * precisely * where you want it by doing something like the following , and then adjusting individual values :, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  z-index : -1 ;, 
  if you get given a `` share '' link , you can view its source by clicking a `` source '' button at the top , to allow you to read the text the creator used to get it looking how they did . 
  here 's one of mine that uses a few somewhat more advanced features , if you 're interested :, 
  yeah , any attempt to put politics onto a one dimensional line is bound to fail . 
  something like the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) is a much better system that can really describe most political positions fairly well . 
  oh , but no , there is no definitive guide that i 'm aware of . 
  yeah , i 've heard that before . 
  it does n't make any sense at all . 
  surely acid and lightning would be a navy blue dragon ?
