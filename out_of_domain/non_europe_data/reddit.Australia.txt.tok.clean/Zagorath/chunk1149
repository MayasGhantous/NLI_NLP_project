  should n't yellow be fire and poison ? 
  this is why i just use gsm : gender and sexual ( ity ) minority . 
  uhh , does n't grey prefer to keep his name secret ? 
  seems a little discourteous to place it out in the open like that . 
  oh fair enough . 
  youtube 's playing up for me so i have n't been able to watch it yet . 
  you just linked to the single most widely reviled source of homebrew out there , famous for being terrible quality overpowered shit . 
  oh interesting . 
  i did n't know it worked that way . 
  awesome . 
  eb is a * little * different to * hold person * and * fly * , but i guess it 's probably similar enough to apply the a similar ruling . 
  at the very least , i think we can all agree that tangled is the best disney movie of the second disney renaissance ( c.a. 
  2010 -- present ) . 
  you know you can edit comments , right ? 
  but anyway , yeah , that is the real name . 
  it was briefly on his wikipedia page before he asked that it remain removed . 
  but anyway , he 's a mod here , so if he does n't like it he can easily remove it . 
   subjectivity is schr\u00f6dinger 's factuality, 
  but that means there 's an objective truth , it just does n't come into being until after observation . 
  wait ... 
  i was going to say it 's like asking a heart surgeon to perform brain surgery , but i think your analogy is better . 
  we 're updating more regularly now !, 
  a couple of new things every month , with a requirement on reviewers to review at least one of them . 
  i do n't even understand why people would ever use hjkl . 
  it 's confusing as fuck !, 
  arrow keys make so much more sense : they 're arrows that point in the direction you 're going to move . 
  having to memorise which of these letters matches the direction you want to go is incredibly unintuitive . 
  bad design . 
  using other shortcuts like number + gg to get to the right line number , and ' \\ ^ ' & ' $ ' to get to the start and end of lines also dramatically reduces time needed to get to the right spot . 
  would n't even have to be just for yourself !, 
  you could use the card to open things up for everyone !, 
  depends on the world . 
  is it a world where the average character , or at least the average ` adventurer ' ( whatever meaning that word takes in your setting ) , can be expected to know about medusae etc. ? 
  if it is , then that 's not metagaming . 
  if not , then it probably is , unless the character happens to be fashion obsessed . 
  that means that in faer\u00fbn , it definitely would not be metagaming , because creepy crawlies are so common and known about there that a kid who grew up in some small tymantheran town knows trolls are weak against fire , medusae freeze you solid unless you look at them in reflection , etc. 
  in my own setting , these things are not as well known or as common , so it would be much more out of character for someone to prepare expecting that kind of thing . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  definitely agree . 
  this is something that should * really * just be a fighter subclass . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   anyway , i actually know the real reason we called ourselves unearthed arcana . 
  it 's a callback to the original 2e unearthed arcana books, 
  wait really ? 
  i always thought we had named ourselves after the 5e series of articles specifically . 
  huh . 
  the more you know . 
  basically everything by / u/the _ singular_anyone . 
  the vampire you mentioned is imo his greatest work , but also way up there are :, 
  * his [ stronghold rules ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 3zn9ut/fortresses _ temples_strongholds_by_uthe_singular / ) , and [ the expansion to them ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4y2jxb/wh _ strongholds_traders_merchants_finally_vendors / ) . 
  * [ ancient dragon warlock patron ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4chsk6/the _ ancient_dragon_warlock_pact_make_a_big / ), 
  * [ the huckster divine rogue archetype ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4b25t8/the _ huckster_a_roguish_archetype_for_the_false / ), 
  * [ modron player race ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4m0a93/wh _ modrons_playable_monodrones_duodrones_and / ) , not so much because it 's good * per se * , but because it convinced me that modrons are n't a really really dumb concept . 
  and , if you 'll allow me the opportunity to plug something of my own , [ the vryloka ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) is what i consider a faithful and balanced recreation of one of my favourite 4e races . 
  i have a soft spot for it , too , but i feel they 're just a little too overtuned for regular games . 
  happy ( lunar ) new year ? 
  you 're absolutely right about everything up until and including the last question mark in this comment . 
  but to me , that 's just an argument for why we need to seriously increase research into the area . 
  to try and work out ways to better tell the difference between these things . 
  but also , there 's the problem of public perception . 
  far too many people seem to think it * is * `` just in your head '' , and they assume that because it 's * possible * that someone with depression might superficially appear the same as someone `` going through a rough time '' , that therefore depression is n't something to be taken seriously . 
  or worse , that it 's a sign of weakness , since when * i * went through tough times , i came out perfectly okay . 
  getting more people to take mental health seriously , and to recognise that it can be just as debilitating as , if not more so than , physical disabilities , is an important goal , and if that means some people are a little over-diagnosed , i think it 's a worthwhile price to pay . 
  better someone without depression be treated unnecessarily than someone with it be made fun of and ignored , and possibly end up suicidal . 
   i 'm not surprised this was reported by buzzfeed, 
  you know buzzfeed uses the clickbaity bullshit list articles they 're famous for as a way to fund serious journalism , right ? 
  are you drunk ? 
  obama did n't run against hillary in 2012 , and even in 2008 they never ran against each other in the presidential race . 
  seriously . 
  why does he think he or other people driving to work have any more right to use the road than some soccer mum taking her kids to school ? 
  stuff them all . 
  use the bus yourself if you 're worried about traffic levels , or ride a bike . 
  korea has the highest suicide rates in the oecd , and japan is n't far behind . 
  so no , not a perfect world by a long shot . 
  it is a bad feat , but as long as a player takes it * knowing * that , surely that should be their choice ? 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  [ here 's the story in question , when it was shared on this subreddit , for anyone who has n't seen it . 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21795a/not _ greentext_but_a_classic_eric_and_the_gazebo / ) it was actually the fourth ever submission to the subreddit ; a true classic . 
  back down again . 
  that 's a good point . 
  taking away darkvision is probably fine , since it 's designed to be a relatively minor feature in terms of how wizards balances races , but a cantrip , even a mostly flavour one like * thaumaturgy * is quite substantial . 
   regardless it takes the cake for worst adaptation and waste of potential ever, 
  i 'm not a big fan of the dragon ball franchise , and i 've never seen its live action movie , so i ca n't comment from personal experience , but from people who are fans of both dbz and avatar , i 've heard that dbz was probably the worse of the two adaptations . . 
  cirque du freak is one of only two movies based on books that i loved in their original form that i have n't seen , precisely because i absolutely love the novels so much , and i 've heard how terrible the movie was . 
  i just could n't bear to put myself through that . 
  not many people will have heard of this , i think , but i thought the movie version of * tomorrow , when the war began * was absolutely atrocious . 
  one of my favourite series of books ( though the follow-up series , the ellie chronicles , was mediocre at best ) , but the movie left me * so * disappointed . 
  according to the comments in / r/lotr , this is only based on the * first * movie , and the first seven chapters of the book . 
  iirc , legolas was n't in the first movie , which ended right after the rescue by the eagles . 
  this sounds great !, 
  i currently use the great suspender , but something that allows me to keep background tabs with their content visible , while still reducing resource use , sounds fantastic !, 
  we 'll see how effective this actually is , though ... 
   therefore north korea is not a communist dictatorship, 
  north korea is actually just straight-up dictatorship , now . 
  [ they dropped the pretense of communism a few years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_north_korea#2009_songun_constitution ) . 
  america 's one of the worst cultures among developed nations , but worldwide ? 
  i dunno , i 'd definitely rather be there than some places ... a guy was arrested for having a pro-atheism blog in indonesia a few years back , and that 's without even starting on the middle-east or war-torn regions of africa . 
  i also ca n't help but feel that they 're still being quite heavily inspired by the show . 
  arya , sansa , bran , jon , catelyn , and tyrion all look far more like their actors than i might expect for this type of work . 
  probably not deliberate .
