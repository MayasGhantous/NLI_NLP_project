  it 's just hard to separate these things . 
  just look at the book covers for the later harry potter novels , for example . 
  i 'm fairly sure it 's been said that they were * trying * to remain consistent with rowling 's original vision , but looking at them , they 're undeniably more like radcliffe than the boy on the philosopher 's stone cover . 
  i 'm just pleased that everyone here is spelling doughnut the * proper * way . 
  ( read the above with over-the-top r.p. ), 
   the pledge was made on monday , in conjunction with an announcement that the 1am lockout - scheduled to be rolled out on february 1 - would be scrapped . 
  well , i guess that one good thing ... 
  sure , but how do you think those values came to be in the religion in the first place ? 
  they 're a basic part of human instinct that developed as a way to encourage social behaviour in early humans . 
  i think it mainly because the joker should n't be around before batman is . 
  also , to a lesser extent , because it kinda defeats the whole point of the `` cult of jerome '' that the show so brilliantly set up when jerome died last time . 
  what 's a `` deathless pact '' ? 
  is that meant to be `` undying pact '' ? 
  mystic is just left of centre , artificer is right of the bard , which is just right of centre . 
  favoured soul was a sorcerer subclass . 
  you 'll find it left of the cleric and above the paladin . 
  but debit cards should work online just the same as credit cards do ... 
  oh right . 
  yes they are . 
  the artificer was released very recently as a standalone class . 
  there was also an artificer subclass of wizard released as i think the first or second ever ua , but it was n't very good . 
  mystic is the new psion , and it 's had two revisions so far , with another one expected before the end of february . 
  yeah macos is no more restrictive than windows . 
  it 's better in some ways , thanks to the underlying unix kernel . 
  yeah , personally in my world i interpret * revivify * as not technically a resurrection spell , but instead bringing the player back from the brink of death . 
  back from a point where they are otherwise guaranteed to die . 
  thay means any restrictions that would otherwise apply to resurrection magic do n't apply to * revivify * . 
  the photo is almost definitely facing either north or south , but unfortunately without knowing whether it was taken in the morning or the afternoon , we ca n't know which . 
  getting angry at china over their ludicrous claims to sea that clearly belongs to vietnam , the phillipines , malaysia , etc. 
  is another good thing . 
  but we 'll see if anything practical actually comes of that , or if it 's all posturing . 
  still , i 'll be surprised if outside of those two things , there 's anything positive to come of this . 
  i think one reason many companies use dmgs is to provide an alias to the application folder , to make it easier for people who could n't work out how to do that otherwise . 
  unfortunate , but necessary . 
  hi sorry , but i 'm removing this submission . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is for 5e homebrew content . 
  you may wish to try / r/dndhomebrew instead . 
  it 's possible they do n't have the new interface yet . 
  i got it a couple of months ago , but then it went back to the old system , and now a couple of days ago i 've gone back to the new one . 
  google is probably a/b testing with it . 
  i have two problems with it myself . 
  it gives a separate notification for each * comment * , rather than one for each thread you 're subscribed to . 
  clicking the notification navigates you to a separate page with the video that comment thread is on , and the comment thread itself at the top , instead of simply popping up over the page you 're currently on . 
  this means you ca n't keep watching the video you 're on while typing a reply to a comment on a different one . 
  just a note , you can still get the old notification system by going to any google site * other * than youtube . 
  it 's a bit annoying and counter-intuitive to have to go to google.com in order to reply to notifications on youtube , but for now that 's the best option . 
  the page you 've linked there seems to only have comments from one 's own videos , which makes it useless when what people are wanting to do is reply to replies to their comments all across youtube . 
   someone in a game attacked a sleeping drow and , when he survived said `` no he 's dead because i hit him in the head . '', 
  assuming they 're not under any particular time pressure ( e.g. , in a combat encounter ) , and there 's no weird effects like magic at play , i would say yes , you * did * kill him . 
  because why not ? 
  hit points , critical hits , etc. , are all mechanical abstractions to reflect all the complexities of a fight . 
  when one target is lying down and you can successfully sneak up in place and with no time pressure land the perfect blow , why not let them succeed ? 
  i 'd be less inclined to rule that way with a hammer blow to the head than i would with a knife cut across the throat , but still ... 
  anyway , that 's only an answer to this one particular scenario . 
  in the general sense , `` yes , and '' is about what the player * attempts * . 
  if the dice declare that they fail in their actions , then they fail , and the dm should n't be obligated to pretend they succeeded . 
  there are people who * do n't * do this ? 
  i feel bad when i have to roll 6d6 because i 've only got 5d6 , so have to roll one more ... 
  it was edited to say `` this was sarcasm '' 4 minutes before you left your comment ( though i 'm guessing you loaded this page before then ) . 
  but yeah , prior to the edit , this was a prime example of poe 's law in action . 
  and on your cakeday , too !, 
  outside of america it definitely is overpriced . 
  in australia , for example , even once you account for currency conversion and add in gst ( which i 'm not even sure they 're actually paying , but we 'll give them the benefit of the doubt ) , we 're still paying over $ 100 too much , on the cheapest model . 
  and support , and updates . 
  then go fucking get one . 
  you 're ( presumably ) an adult , with your own money . 
  there 's nothing stopping you . 
  but those of us who want an upper-mid-priced/ranged smartphone without crapware stuffing it , and with software support for more than one year literally have no option for that at the moment . 
  another option , if you ca n't find a jumbo d20 , would be to use some other sort of fancy die . 
  if their normal dice are all opaque , then a translucent die might stand out , for example . 
   and if they were sneaking around a sleeping human , i would make them make a stealth check against a lower dc ( in this case , i would say 10 or 11 ), 
  why not just treat it as disadvantage : -5 to passive perception . 
  thinking realistically , it 's a bit absurd that you could walk around someone that 's asleep , as an average person , and wake them up as much as half the time . 
   do n't ever tell the players what they have to do, 
  that said , ** do ** make sure they are making decisions with every bit of knowledge their characters would have . 
  if they 're trying to do something that 's obviously stupid , remind them , before allowing them to actually do it , of precisely why it would be a stupid idea . 
  if they want to go ahead anyway , so be it . 
  it 's easy for players to forget or not hear information given to them by the dm that would be really obvious to the characters . 
  my nexus 4 was supported for 2 years , and nexus 5s were dropped one year later . 
  it 's 3-2-1 backup . 
  3 copies , at least 2 different media ( hard drive , optical , solid state , etc. 
  ) , and at least 1 off-site . 
  only if you 've got all of that can you * truly * say it 's safe . 
  i was actually really disappointed with the search feature at first . 
  i took a trip to sri lanka and had a bunch of photos of monkeys , many of which are * really * clear and close up . 
  but a search for `` monkey '' , which was the very first thing i tried , since i knew how good google photos ' search was supposed to be , and that the typical example was animals like dogs , shows exactly nothing . 
  `` no results . 
  try a synonym or more general keyword . '', 
  and unfortunately , it comes with no way to manually tag things . 
  no way to help the system to learn to identify things over time , like we 've had for * years * with the local face-recognition features of dams like aperture . 
  i 've since discovered that it works most of the time for most other things i try , but that initial test of it failed , so that 's left a bad taste in my mouth . 
  eh , mothers ' and fathers ' days are stupid commercial bullshit anyway . 
  not like christmas which started as a proper holiday and businesses commercialised it , but full on cynically created commercial days . 
  not that i 'm actually in favour of changing to that date . 
  i really do n't give a shit either way . 
  i 've never even been in the country on 26-01 since i was , like , 9 . 
  my only point is that it overlapping with mother 's day once every 7 years is not a good argument against it . 
  even site-wide banned links are usually manually approvable by mods , though . 
  source : i have a ** lot ** of people trying to link to quickmeme on my subreddit . 
   damage should be thought of in injuries,
