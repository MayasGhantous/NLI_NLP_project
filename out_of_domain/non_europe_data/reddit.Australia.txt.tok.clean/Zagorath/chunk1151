  actually , no . 
  hp is incredibly abstract , and it represents many things besides just how many times and in what way you 've been hit . 
  if a pc with 40 hp at full health takes 4 points of damage , they probably * did n't * actually get hit at all . 
  rather than all the dots , just insert a column break .

  calling it a `` sport '' is a bit of a stretch though , imo . 
  being a fun/cool activity that can also be done competitively does n't make it a sport .

  you did n't like httyd2 ? 
  ouch . 
  i 'd say it 's my favourite animated franchise still currently being made . 
  the first two season of the tv show are n't fantastic , but they 're not terrible either , and the latter three seasons ( the netflix ones ) introduce one of the most well-utilised villains i 've seen in * any * tv show for a long time . 
  what 's the pixar httyd ? 
  in fact , the * only * films where i 'm aware that claim is true are antz and the fish one . 
  * maybe * the `` zoo animals in the wild '' one . 
  i do n't actually remember which of those is the popular one because i liked * neither * . 
  you said that every dreamworks film had a more respected pixar counterpart . 
  what 's the counterpart to how to train your dragon ? 
  interesting . 
  what sort of content is in tiers 4 and 5 ?

  really great show .

  ## overall score 9/10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 9/10, 
  the wording of many mechanical features was very terse . 
  this is not , itself , a bad thing , and it gets the point across effectively . 
  however , it makes the wording dramatically different from similar features that already exist in the game . 
  this was most notable in the general alchemical effects table , where it was clear the creator intended to compress as much information into as small a space as possible . 
  the artwork , when used , looks lovely , and the choice to include little icons representing the elements was a very nice touch . 
  however , the art was rather sparse for such a comprehensive document . 
  some images representing specific recipes or bombs might have improved things somewhat . 
  the fact that this was able to be squeezed down into just two pages is quite a remarkable feat , but it certainly feels as though it was an effort to achieve . 
  the text directly surrounding images feels very cramped , and would benefit from a little more room to breathe . 
  allowing a third page would also allow for more space for the artwork , as mentioned above . 
  there are also some small typos , such as `` instant rope can be snapped with a ** with a ** dc 20 strength check . '', 
  ( emphasis mine . ), 
  ### theme/creativity : 9/10, 
  these alchemy rules come with some very interesting and creative options for alchemists . 
  the basic ruleset is pretty comprehensive , and the list of items detailed in this supplement , while not exhaustive , are pretty extensive , and the ruleset feels like it is well placed for more extensions to be added in , if needed . 
  each of the abilities , in addition to their mechanical effects , are accompanied with sound flavourful explanations , and even a good amount of not strictly necessary descriptive text . 
  i particularly liked the description of * melt powder * as a powder which `` shimmers like tiny rubies even in darkness . '', 
  one thing i would have liked to have seen , which was absent , was a description of each of the ingredients included in the common and special ingredient tables , as well as descriptions of what qualities one could expect alternate ingredients with the same components to possess . 
  as it is , the ingredients have no real flavour to them , and exist purely to serve the mechanical function of restricting what you can make to a probabilistic function of how much time you spend foraging . 
  some rules for * buying * ingredients would also have been appreciated -- how easily can merchants for different ingredients be found , and how much would you expect to pay ? 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9/10, 
  the effects of alchemical bombs are very well designed . 
  the ability to increase the cost ( in terms of time to make and ingredients ) in order to add multiple effects , or enhance existing ones ( in range or damage dice ) is a very clever mechanic , and the way some of these interact with one another is nicely designed . 
  there are some minor problems with it , however . 
  the one that most strikingly stands out is that earth and water combine to cause `` any damage-dealing effects [ to ] continue to deal 1 damage each until an action is used to remove the gel '' . 
  this is problematic , since `` any damage-dealing effects '' is not a well-defined phrase . 
  is it intended only to be effects from these alchemical bombs ? 
  if so , it would have been better if it had specified . 
  as it is currently , it could be interpreted to mean that if the target is targeted by a sword strike before the gel is removed , it will continue to deal damage . 
  additionally , while the cold , acid , fire , and * maybe * lightning bombs make sense to -- excuse the pun -- * gel * with this ability , the shrapnel combining in this way makes a lot less sense . 
  the * snappowder * is lacking a description of how far away its crackles can be heard , but this was perhaps the only true * error * i noticed in the mechanical effects of the document . 
  ### overview :, 
  this is an absolutely fantastic supplement that i feel captures extremely well the feeling many players who wish to play a character that relies on alchemy would desire . 
  if my setting were a higher tech one , i would begin including this supplement immediately , it 's that good . 
  even so , i may consider trying to find a way to work it in . 
  whoops , forgot to tag the creator :,

  could be worse . 
  could be a store dedicated to british power cables , or a store making nothing but d4s . 
  ok that was a fantastic read , but wow tog , your title is hilarious . 
  it reads like something subreddit simulator might come up with !, 
  asynchronous warfare is what you do every time you play a game of civilisation .

  i think comparing the lord of the rings novel -  films to the hobbit novel -  films is an unfair comparison . 
  the hobbit films were undoubtably stretched out more than they should have been , but not by nearly as much as this simplistic comparison would imply . 
  lord of the rings is an * incredibly * wordy novel . 
  an awful lot of pages are dedicated to things that have no or very little impact on the films ' running time . 
  by contrast , the hobbit as a novel is * crazy * dense . 
  very little visual description compared to lotr , and actions are described in far fewer words . 
  it is out of sheer * necessity * , inevitable that the hobbit should have a lower score in words per second than the lord of the rings . 
  it 's actually kinda crazy just * how quickly * the hobbit moves as a novel . 
  so many big set pieces occur in the book that might only take a few hundred words or less , but which require a decent chunk of time on screen to do justice . 
  the hobbit films also made the ( imo very important ) decision to include material from the appendices to the lord of the rings . 
  stuff with the white council and gandalf 's trip to dol guldur , which is hinted at in the original book , but never actually shown . 
  it would n't have translated very well to the screen to leave that out . 
  do n't get me wrong , the hobbit definitely stretched itself thinner than it should have been .
