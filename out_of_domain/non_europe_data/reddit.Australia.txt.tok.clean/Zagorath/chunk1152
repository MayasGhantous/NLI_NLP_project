  i would particularly point to the escape from the goblin cave in the first film , the escape from the elves in the barrels , and the escape from erebor ( the whole scene with the melting gold statue ) , as being scenes that all went on * at least * twice as long as they should have . 
  even watching those scenes in the cinema for the first time , i was just thinking ... when is this going to end ... i 'm a bit bored of this ... the barrel scene was particularly painful , for defeating the point of the equivalent scene in the book . 
  as a side note , purely out of interest , it would be interesting to see a more accurate representation of the hobbit . 
  according to the attached article , it divided the original book 's word count squarely in three , and assumed the running time of the second and third movies were exactly the same as the first , since the article came out before those films did . 
  at the very least , i wish that the lord of the rings could have included * the scouring of the shire * . 
  they teased it in lothl\u00f3rien with the mirror of galadriel , and it would have been the perfect culmination of the hobbits ' character arcs , especially merry and pippin 's . 
  and obviously , to do * scouring * justice , merry and pippin would have needed a bit more in the way of character development and a definitive arc earlier on in the films . 
  you do realise dividing one non-negative number by another can * never * result in a negative number , right ? 
  the hunchback of notre dame has the disney version and no less than [ five ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_hunchback_of_notre-dame#films ) other films with exactly the same title , and a bunch more that follow the same plot with different titles . 
  of those , the 1939 is by far the most highly regarded . 
  tom bombadil 's absence did n't hurt the movies too much , but like the other guy said , * the scouring * is * crucial * to demonstrating how the hobbits , especially merry and pippin , developed over the course of their journey . 
  by leaving it out , their character arcs are incomplete . 
  lovely looking map design , but `` world map '' ? 
  that 's either a * tiny * world , or some really fucking massive mountains and an ** enormous ** volcano . 
  [ the caldera of that volcano alone is the size of germany , austria , and poland combined , with a little room left over ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crecf7a.jpg ) , assuming a planet the size of earth . 
  that 's done by resizing your map so the top edge and bottom edge nearly ( but not quite ) reach the top and bottom edge of a world map . 
  it would work really nicely as a region map though . 
  i made a `` world map '' using the same tutorial as you , but wound up with the same problem , so i decided to shrink mine down and just leave the rest of the world unmapped for now . 
  mechanically there 's nothing wrong with allowing something like this , but in terms of flavour it does n't make a lot of sense . 
  the longbow is * already * a weapon in the game , and it uses dex . 
  yes , a longbow requires a great deal of strength to use , but it 's a minimum threshold , and does n't really aid accuracy or damage . 
  that 's why dex is used . 
  if you want to allow it , then it 's fine . 
  it wo n't harm the balance of your game very much if at all . 
  but it really does n't make sense . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  yeah , the only thing that tipped me off was the fact that there is no 30th month . 
  weight-based traps probably need more than just 45 n to activate , assuming its ability to push is the same as its ability to lift . 
  but it could conceivably activate tripwires . 
  personally , i would say yes , so long as it 's not a fine motor skill . 
  but i do n't think the rules are entirely clear on the matter . 
  so it 's up to a dm to make the call for their table . 
  yeah , that 's a really good point . 
  calculating exactly how much force would be imparted is ... difficult , since it depends on the way the object and the ground react upon impact . 
  but if we assume the trigger depression plus the object being dropped 's deformation is equivalent to a stopping distance of 0.1 & nbsp ; m , and the height dropped from is 2.5 & nbsp ; m ( about 8 ' 2 '' , which seems reasonable to me for a dungeon , enough room for the tallest of people to swing a weapon about ) , and the object is the maximum 9 & nbsp ; kg , the average impact force will be over 2200 & nbsp ; n , or the equivalent of over ** 490 & nbsp ; lbs ** .

  my group uses pc vs pc social rolls in two senses . 
  one is deception vs. insight . 
  we use this exactly like they would play out on npcs . 
  if pc 1 's deception roll is higher , pc 2 is unable to tell that they are lying , and believes that , as far as they can tell , the pc 1 's statement is truthful ( or at least pc 1 believes it is true ) . 
  the other sense is persuasion , intimidation , etc. 
  in this case , we treat it kinda like the legal concept of `` persuasive precedent '' ( as opposed to a true `` precedent '' , which is binding ) . 
  that is , if you roll persuasion against me , the higher you roll , the more value i will place on your point of view . 
  but ultimately , i still make the decision based on my own character and their motivations . 
  i assume , from the way you 've written your post , that you 're already proficient in dvorak ? 
  i ask only because if you are * not * , i would * highly * recommend against rearranging the keyboard . 
  if you are already capable though , then go ahead . 
  also worth considering is the nibs on u and h ( qwerty f and j ) . 
  if you rearrange an initially qwerty keyboard , you 'll be missing those . 
   maybe only gearheads can appreciate it ? 
  honestly , yes , i think . 
  from what i heard , the people involved in the project really love the franchise . 
  they loved cars and the idea of the so-called `` great american road trip '' . 
  it was a passion project for them . 
  but huge numbers of people who do n't care very much about cars ( including myself ) just find very little redeemable about cars . 
  probably also did n't hurt that it was an absolute goldmine for merchandising . 
  sure , but he 's also not a film animation expert . 
  he 's a video game designer . 
  he * ca n't * be the next walt disney , because he does something completely different to disney . 
  might as well call him the next nicola tesla or the next steve jobs . 
  all of them were visionaries , but all in different industries . 
  that 's not a knock on miyamoto at all . 
  his work is legendary . 
  but he does n't qualify for successor to disney . 
   the highest individual tax rate in the us is 32.6 % and that 's for someone making over $ 400,000 a year . 
  all you had to do was look that up . 
  i do n't know about the other guy , but [ i did look it up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_tax_in_the_united_states#marginal_tax_rates_for_2017 ) , and the figure i 'm seeing is 39.6 % . 
  that 's marginal , of course , but i figure that 's what everyone 's talking about here anyway . 
  [ and here 's an irs pdf ] ( https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-16-55.pdf ) with the same data , in case you do n't trust wikipedia . 
  edit : there 's also the fact that the us has this uniquely bizarre ( read : shit ) system where you pay federal income tax , but then also have to pay state and possibly even local income taxes on top of that . 
  so the real figure may be much higher than 40 % . 
   something that replicates the katana ( functionally similar to the scimitar , but with the ability to wield one in two hands ), 
  the katana works perfectly in 5e as a longsword . 
  ninja edit : i agree with you that most of this is not , strictly speaking , necessary . 
  but as / u/mournagain says , it 's a relatively useful thing to have if running an asian themed campaign , to just ignore the phb table and look at this one instead . 
   and druids use a different mechanism for spell casting, 
  please do elaborate . 
  i 'm curious . 
  oh man i loved summoner as a kid !, 
  and there was a sequel ? 
  is it good ? 
  is its narrative/cast related to the originals ? 
  also the original is available on pc . 
  both gog and steam . 
  and , since it 's so old , it could run on a literal potato , so you do n't need a decent computer to run it . 
   why do we even call chinese new year anymore with so many asian races celebrating it as well . 
  honestly , i really do n't think we should . 
  i say lunar new year , which is its more proper name in english , and i try to point out when my friends call it chinese new year that that 's a touch offensive . 
  lunar new year is one of the biggest holidays in most of eastern asia . 
  it 's their equivalent of our new year , christmas , and easter rolled into one . 
  i lived in vietnam for a while , and i 'm there ( here ? ), 
  right now . 
  it 's definitely their biggest holiday of the year . 
  locally it 's referred to as `` tet '' . 
  people typically go home to their parents ' house and spend the week with family . 
  businesses across the country are closed down for the week , or operating on severely limited hours . 
  instead of exchanging gifts as we do at chrissy , they give money in little red envelopes . 
  for middle class children , this adds up to some * serious * money from their entire extended family . 
  i also lived in korea for a little while .
