  there it 's `` sol nal '' , and it 's probably their second biggest holiday , after the harvest festival * chuseok * . 
  i know it 's also celebrated in malaysia and singapore , but i could n't say how important it is for them or what they call it . 
  probably a hoax of some sort , but kinda funny anyway . 
   why would winning a simple plurality in a state give you all the electoral votes ? 
  an interesting idea , you 've alluded to here . 
  i wonder what the presidency would look like ( this year , and other years as far back as at least 2000 ) if every state were required to distribute their ec votes proportionally to the vote in that state . 
  no `` one to the outright winner and the rest proportional '' , no `` allot them by district '' , just a simple pure proportional allocation based on the state-wide vote . 
  oddly , i was working with 20 pounds for some reason . 
  not entirely sure where i got that from , but it was n't * quite * a nasa . 
  still , with the rest of the assumptions the same , we can get over 980 & nbsp ; n. 220 & nbsp ; lbs . 
  i was at international house for my first two years . 
  i loved it in the first year . 
  great opportunities to make friends and participate in sporting and social activities . 
  the location is super convenient , and of course not needing to worry about cooking or cleaning is a real help in getting a foothold . 
  in my second year it started getting tedious . 
  mediocre food at extremely rigid times is something you can only put up with for so long . 
  but ih had the advantage of letting students stay in residence from february to november . 
  without that luxury , and if you do n't have anywhere else you could store stuff ( relatives or friends who could lend you some storage space ? 
  ) , that could be very awkward . 
  not strictly a mix . 
  a devil getting it on with a human begets a cambion , not a tiefling . 
  tieflings ' origin is more like a dragon sorcerer 's . 
  just some vague notion of your ancestors being tainted by devils somehow . 
  because of this , tieflings * always * begets tieflings . 
  a half tiefling , half human is just a tiefling . 
  their blood runs strong , as it were . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't know of any canonical examples of that happening . 
  probably one of those areas where a dm has to make a ruling of their own . 
  personally , i would rule that the character * looks * like a half-orc -- tiefling cross , with a half-orc 's facial structure and build , but a tiefling 's eyes , horns , tail , and tint . 
  but that they have all the same stats as a normal tiefling , mostly for simplicity 's sake . 
  besides , it 's not like regular tieflings keep much in common with humans , anyway . 
  it 's worth noting that in 5e you really * do n't * need a healer if you do n't want one . 
  but if you do , as a group , really want a healer , other options where an atheist makes sense are the bard and druid . 
  the other question is , does this guy 's character not * believe * in gods ? 
  despite the fact that he lives in a world where gods are actually real and actually intervene in the world ( unlike , say , our own world , where atheism makes sense due to the absence of evidence for a god ) ? 
  or does he simply choose not to * worship * any god ? 
  the expression is actually `` hear , hear '' . 
  it derives from `` hear him , hear him '' , which is definitely somewhat counterintuitive if you 've only ever heard it used in the modern form . 
  but yes indeed . 
  hear , hear !, 
  and remember it 's not just supergirl the character , but the show had a fairly major arc which was a thinly veiled analogy for the immigration debate involving literal aliens living on earth . 
   more than half the women who voted , voted for him, 
  is there actual data on this ? 
  we know that out of the * entire * voting population , more than half voted for hillary , not trump , and i would be absolutely * shocked * if the relative percentage of women voting for trump was higher than the percentage of men . 
  passed 350 & nbsp ; k just a moment ago . 
  that 's a good point . 
  because the us is a de facto two-party system , i forgot that it is not a de jure one . 
  i should have said a majority of the two-party preferred results . 
  but you need to calm down and not be so damn rude . 
  an algorithm produces a list of some unknown number of `` trending '' subreddits , based on some unknown variables ( likely including subscriber growth , page hits , etc. ) . 
  the admins then manually choose 5 trending subreddits from this algorithmically generated list . 
  they * frequently * do it to create a deliberate narrative . 
  sometimes ( like today ) that narrative is political , sometimes it 's just funny . 
  while there 's less immediate need for this , since no one else elected trump , here are some links for other countries . 
  * [ australia ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/senators_and_members/guidelines_for_contacting_senators_and_members ) . 
  enter your post code , and then click the name of your representative or senator to get their phone number or parliamentary po box . 
  some also have a `` connect '' tab with email addresses , social media , etc. 
  * [ canada ] ( http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/compilations/houseofcommons/memberbypostalcode.aspx?menu=hoc ) . 
  enter postal code , and it takes you straight to your mp , giving telephone , email address , and postal address for both their local constituency and at parliament . 
  it also tells you their preferred contact language . 
  * [ new zealand ] ( https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/contact-an-mp/ ) is a little tricky , since you have both local members and party list mps , but your parliament 's website does a good job of explaining how to contact them . 
  * [ united kingdom ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/ ) . 
  enter your post code , and it should take you straight to a page with your mp that will have email , phone , address , and social media contact details . 
  in the general sense , regardless of where you are , ** phone is the best method of communication ** , since it requires a staffer be there to receive it at the exact time of call . 
  it ca n't be avoided . 
  a posted letter is next best , since the physical volume of mail received is noteworthy , and they can see the address from which it was posted as some confirmation that you are indeed in their electorate . 
  email and social media are worth less , but not * entirely * worthless . 
   filmed by a 12 year old with an ipod touch 1st generation, 
  man , that must have been * really * challenging , considering ipod touches did n't even get cameras until 4th gen !, 
  that would certainly explain why the movie ended up how it did ... 
  i mean , that 's also the start of a new hope , which has more parallels in its plot than just that . 
  star wars opens with good guy rebels trying to deliver something important to their rebellion , but right before being caught by the evil empire , they send the mcguffin away , where it is found by our hero , who ( after the events described in your comment ) leaves home with the mcguffin and an old wize man who is part of an ancient extinct order , to go and rescue the princess from the empire and then join the rebellion . 
  i mean , i 'm in a thread discussing a high fantasy novel so , yeah , that 's kinda a given . 
  but the reason i know this is because i owned a 3rd gen touch . 
   but hey , who cares about 600,000 unrepresented people right ? 
  yeah it 's a bit ridiculous . 
  dc has a higher population than two states , and yet vermont and wyoming have * three * congresspeople . 
  but i mean , it could be worse . 
  you could be puerto rico . 
  at least you guys can vote for the president . 
  they do n't even have that luxury . 
  america should take a page from australia 's handbook , and give some ( albeit smaller ) senatorial representation to districts and territories , as well as representatives . 
  one senator and one representative each . 
  both you and / u/darklordzoltan may be interested in [ this story ] ( http://i.imgur.com/csaix.jpg ) from the / r/dndgreentext [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  everything i wrote there works equally for eragon and star wars . 
  not wot , which was my point . 
  damn that was fast . 
  in terms of cartography , i do n't see any obvious errors . 
  the forested area is really large , but that 's not necessarily a problem . 
  you could * maybe * do with slightly more roughed up coastlines , but at this scale i think the level you 've got is mostly fine . 
  i really want to know the conversation/storyline that lead to you needing to ask this question . 
  i ca n't imagine it being anything less than amazing . 
  i found tilting my screen back and reading it at a greater angle made it easier to read . 
  your username is blasphemy .
