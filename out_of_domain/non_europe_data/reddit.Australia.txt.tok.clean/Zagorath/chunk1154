  if you see something that you think is incomplete , or a request , it would be immensely helpful if you were to hit the `` report '' button . 
  we as mods eventually get around to seeing every post and checking it , though we do n't spend an enormous amount of time looking over everything . 
  hitting the report button means we will get to it sooner , and we 'll look a little more closely at it . 
  on a more specific note , looking at our moderation logs , there 's only been one post that 's been removed in the past 48 hours because of incompleteness , so if there are any other posts still up that you think should have been removed , please let us know so we can see where you 're coming from with that . 
  our basic rule is that things need to be in a mostly complete , playable state . 
  not perfectly balanced or refined , but it must be broadly complete . 
  this class has no features defined after the 2nd level , and even the features it has are not written up in a clear way . 
  if you post it on the arcana forge thread , you 'll be able to get feedback on how to get it into a workable state , so that it can be posted here as a submission . 
  it really is . 
  my group has come up with a heap of rules and alterations to spells with the intent of making it harder for casters to just use magic as a catch-all solution to every possible obstacle outside of combat . 
  it seems pretty bland and uninteresting , imo . 
  it 's just a club , but you can use it at a very short range instead of only melee . 
  and only once per day . 
  to make it more interesting , it should do * something * of interest . 
  some minor effect of some sort that makes it worthwhile . 
  what have you based the balance of * devivify * on ? 
  it 'd be easier to help with balance advice if we know where you got the numbers from . 
  without comparing to anything in particular , * devivify * seems like a * really * powerful spell . 
  if ( as the name suggests ) you 're balancing against * revivify * , it 's important to note that resurrection spells are kinda special , since they have a non-trivial material cost associated with them . 
  * mass inflict wounds * should probably say `` each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere of a point within range '' or something like that . 
  look to * fireball * or * mass cure wounds * for the appropriate wording . 
  in terms of balance , i 'd be tempted to say it should be as close as possible to the same relationship with * inflict wounds * as * mass cure wounds * has with * cure wounds * . 
  i 'd say 6d10 , so it stays as the same die type , for example ( with roughly the same average roll as the current form has ) . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  yeah that 's a lot more interesting . 
  yes it is , but i would n't try to use that to infer anything about americans or american culture . 
  it 's the result of their marriage legislation being comparatively vague , and their courts being much more politically empowered ( by convention , if not by legal power ) . 
   i made a similar comment on facebook recently . 
  along the lines of `` we ca n't go mocking americans considering what our country elects in '' . 
  it got shot down to hell . 
  yes . 
  and rightly so . 
  pauline hanson is the worst we 've got currently , but ( a ) she has far , ** far ** less power than trump does , being only 3 out of 76 senators , as opposed to controlling the entire executive ( of a country with an executive that is far more empowered than our own ) , and ( b ) she is a much lower level of crazy than trump is . 
  she 's his equal in immigration-related policies , and not much else . 
  not nearly the same level of utter disregard for fact that trump has shown . 
  considering a lightning rod is going to be transferring as much as 5 & nbsp ; gj , my recommendation would be to consult a proper trained electrician to find out how best to proceed . 
  wow that was a great read , thanks for sharing !, 
  very well written , and extremely well argued . 
  out of interest , what method did you use for rounding the ev votes in the penultimate column of the tables ? 
  yup . 
  this is the game where it went from a really cool historical fiction game with a slowly building present day story , which could have culminated in a really cool game set entirely ( or maybe just with its third act entirely ) in the present day , to a bland , yearly blockbuster title with no care about anything but making just enough technical improvements to keep people buying it annually . 
  ac iii turned the franchise into historical , single-player call of duty . 
   we had a one day a week for politics . 
  when was this ? 
  i certainly do n't ever remember this being the case . 
  i 'm sorry , who is '' * they * '' ? 
  i never saw anything about specific days for politics . 
  the problem is that both of those words are far more broad , as they include a number of pacific islands , including micronesia , polynesia , and new guinea . 
  and by some definitions , they ( australasia especially ) can even include most of the rest of indonesia . 
   i 've been subbed for a while now , and i 'm thoroughly convinced that a large percent of the people that post there do n't actually want anybody to change their view , given how stubbornly they cling to them, 
  yeah . 
  i was subscribed right from the very beginning , and it was amazing back then . 
  but it * very * quickly devolved into exactly what you described . 
  i stuck around for a while after that , but eventually i just got sick of it and unsubbed . 
  the * best-case scenario * will still involve the sub coming off as incredibly biased , because reality is biased -- and never more so than concerning trump . 
  if there were an / r/obama _ watch , or even an / r/w _ bush_watch , it would not be ( in the best case scenario ) nearly as biased . 
  [ fixed link for desktop users ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level ) . 
  anyway , i do n't think that list is a very good one . 
  as it says , it 's based more on the languages spoken than the actual ethnic diversity . 
  that 's problematic , since here in australia , for example , we have some great ethnic diversity , but the vast majority of second and third generations speak english , and thus we end up looking like one of the * least * diverse countries in the world . 
   cultural fractionalization is approximated by a measure of similarity between languages , varying from 1 = the population speaks two or more unrelated languages to 0 = the entire population speaks the same language . 
  this index of cultural diversity is biased towards linguistic variations as opposed to genetic diversity and other variations, 
  that said , i would certainly agree with your basic premise that the us is not the most diverse country in the world . 
  there seems to be a dearth of research that uses a reasonable metric for diversity of a country , but [ at least one report ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-17/australia-second-most-multicultural-country/2339884 ) puts australia near the top , but seems to fail to have a nice succinct list containing all the other countries . 
  even so , i find it very hard to believe that a reasonable metric would put the us as far down as 85 . 
  not 1 , for sure , but top ~ 20 at least . 
  you made something called `` crazy cat lady '' and shared it on the internet , and never even bothered to add a picture of an adorable ( or otherwise -- as if there were such a thing ) cat ? 
  for shame , sir !, 
  bach used the motif b \u266d , a , c , b ( or , using the german system , b , a , c , h ) in quite a few of his compositions . 
  a musical signature , if you will . 
  a few other composers used that same motif , in reference to the master . 
  there 's also the dsch motif , which stands for dmitri shostakovich . 
  s as a phonetic equivalent to `` es '' , or e \u266d . 
  but how does one become addicted to something that 's as bad as smoking ? 
  in this day and age , when we know just how * incredibly * bad it is for you , plus the fact that it 's no longer socially the `` cool '' thing to do , and the fact that unlike some other drugs , you have to * get addicted * to it before you start `` enjoying '' it . 
  people who are n't yet addicted almost universally find the smell awful . 
  what sorta panel ? 
   to people who know their christianity , the joke does n't work, 
  also to people who have simply had this specific fact pointed out to them before :p, 
  yeah , but surely nobody can see them as * positives * ? 
  how do you take up something that has nothing but negatives ( until * after * you 've gotten addicted ) , even if those negatives are not terrible in your opinion ? 
  i 'm guessing people thought you were talking about gotham the show , rather than gotham the eponymous city ? 
  it 's informational and has high production values , but it 's not about gaming in the slightest . 
  i 'm not sure it 's the best comparison . 
  not to mention how ... just ... bizarre it is sometimes . 
  you were right the first time with the s. 
  you know there 's never been a terrorist attack on american soil caused by a national of one of the banned countries , right ? 
  unfortunately , that 's just not true . 
  sort this very thread by `` controversial '' and you 'll see . 
  trump 's hateful rhetoric might not have the support of the majority , but it is not an insignificant threat , either . 
  yeah it is . 
  both are fine ( and mean the same thing -- it 's * not * like practise ) . 
  though admittedly in australia we generally prefer the c spelling . 
  but we 've already missed the eugenics wars by two decades . 
  uhh , why did you copy and paste the german reddit comment responses bar into your comment ? 
  dude went to brisbane , not townsville . 
  assuming that the upcoming season is the last one ( and dear god , i hope it is ) , and that they either follow the plot from the uk version or appear to follow it and then subvert it at the last moment , believe me , they absolutely * will * top this . 
  and young justice is coming back !, 
  the dcau is fucking fantastic . 
  batman : the animated series is , as far as i 'm concerned , * the * *** definitive *** batman telling .
