  superman tas ( which i only actually watched last year for the first time ) is what got me genuinely interested in superman as a character . 
  and justice league is of course amazing . 
  i do n't know if you 've seen it , but young justice is another animated show which has all the right pieces . 
  it 's an ensemble piece like justice league , but it has overarching stories and character arcs , instead of being a bunch of standalone or two-to-three part episodes . 
  it got two full seasons which wrapped up nicely before being cancelled , but they recently announced it would be coming back ( but no further details ) . 
  it ca n't possibly be anything but . 
  ok intrigued , it 's really worth a watch . 
  the show has a very different tone to the us one ( it puts up a facade of everything being right and proper , while the us show is very open about the dark gritty plot ) , but it 's every bit as good . 
  it 's only three seasons of three or four ( i forget which ) episodes . 
  i wo n't say how it ends , so that you can experience it yourself ( whether you watch the uk version or wait for the us one to come out ) . 
  one thing i will say is that the broad strokes of the ending should be obvious if you can tell where the show gets its inspiration from ( and neither show is particularly coy about the inspiration , though the uk one makes it * slightly * clearer ) . 
  around season four , i saw someone say that the shakespearean tragedy comes in 5 acts . 
  my hope is that that 's what this show is doing as well . 
  i honestly felt that the last two seasons were largely filler , so i really hope they end it this year , but like you i fear they 'll drag it out . 
  ysk that [ the heimlich manoeuvre is not recommended by physicians ] ( https://www.accreditedfirstaid.com.au/2014/08/22/the-heimlich-manouevre-why-dont-we-use-it/ ) . 
   the risks of the hm appear to outweigh the benefit - especially when there is a more effective way of dislodging the object with less risk of causing harm in the process . 
  reported injuries sustained as a direct result of the hm include gastric rupture , lacerated liver , fractured xiphoid process/sternum , aspiration of stomach contents and other serious complications ( see references below ) . 
  use back blows and chest thrusts instead . 
  wow , what happened in that second sample ? 
  [ here 's my 3 korean samples ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lp70xib.png ) . 
  there has been one adventure . 
  it 's actually the piece with the highest score . 
  you probably missed it because its title does n't seem like the title of an adventure . 
  [ here ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 3tfppn/army _ of_the_damned_by_uspiketaildrake / ), 
  i 'm curious as to how this interacts with the spell preparation rules . 
  it seems like it could easily be a cheap way to get around the limit on number of spells prepared , if it 's just allowed to ignore them . 
  i would propose something like allowing the lead wizard to prepare spells even if they require spell slots higher than the wizard can cast on their own , and then require that a wizard have the spell prepared in order to lead a circle in casting that spell . 
  if i were to put a level cap on this , i 'd be tempted to make it level 5 , to match both the maximum spell slot half casters can cast normally , and the maximum slot warlocks get with their normal casting . 
  just seems kinda elegant that way . 
  and while i agree with you that for balance reasons something like this is extremely useful , like op said in [ this comment ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5rby5s/wheel _ of_time_magic_linking_in_5e / dd670ao / ) , it 's a pretty cool epic story that 's made possible by * not * restricting things . 
  i ca n't think of an entirely convincing way to restrict things to keep it balanced , * and * make it possible for the same mechanics to enable that sort of epic lore . 
  the best way i can think of is simply having casters be relatively rare in the setting -- or at least casters capable of casting with slots higher than level 1 or 2 , because at that point it becomes infeasible to do anything special with them . 
  if the number of people required is greater than about 4 or 5 , the party usually is n't going to be able to muster that . 
  one small thing that might help keep things in check just a little would be to restrict the maximum spell slot * expended * in the process to level 5 . 
  that way four casters with 5th level spell slots could still cast a level 7 spell , etc. , but you could n't get a normal-ish party with two casters casting eight level spells when they should only have access to 7th , etc. 
  also needed to be tied to your god damn google account , instead of your phone number . 
  using your phone number as id for non phone things is bullshit . 
  it 's why i 'll never use whatsapp or any other similar apps . 
  when you have multiple devices -- many of which are n't even connected to the phone network -- using a phone number as id makes no fucking sense . 
  yup . 
  they also kept under-18s out * entirely * for gods-be-damned * ages * . 
  they lifted it a few months before i turned 18 , but it was so long after they had first made the product that any hype there was for it was long gone , so i could n't convince anyone to give it a go . 
   it 's whatsapp but not super ugly, 
  it also uses your facebook account as your id , rather than your phone number . 
  the latter is a total dealbreaker for me because it makes no fucking sense . 
   apart from proper standalone pc client, 
  i ca n't even begin to imagine how this is ** not ** a * complete * deal breaker for most people . 
  it certainly is for me ... and it 's not something that whatsapp can possibly fix without completely changing their model , because they made the idiotic decision to use your * phone number * as your account id . 
   allo is device based , not account based, 
  this is exactly the fucking problem . 
  it was a dumb decision on google 's part . 
  it is n't an excuse for not having a web client , because it is itself the problem . 
  use your google account as your id , not your fucking phone number . 
  a lot of people have speculated that they 're doing it because they do n't want to go anywhere near an antitrust violation . 
  it 's certainly a feasible explanation , but not a particularly satisfying one for those of us who would really like allo if it fixed a few small problems . 
  yeah got ta be honest , i do n't get the sms obsession either . 
  i send maybe a dozen or so a year . 
  facebook messenger is where i do 90 % of my chat . 
  what makes allo dead in the water for me and my circle of friends is that it does n't have a web client . 
  and that ca n't be properly fixed because the devs made the idiotic decision to use your phone number rather than your google account as your allo id . 
  i really * want * to be able to use allo . 
  the assistant could have been really handy for my group . 
  rather than one person looking up film times and then relaying them to the group , it all could have been done through assistant . 
  on the occasions when we do some of our roleplaying through chat rather than in person , telling assistant to `` roll a d20 '' would be really handy ( assuming it works like that in group chat -- i know the pixel assistant is capable of responding to that command , but i do n't know if allo 's is ) , letting others see the result easily . 
   google assistant is gimmicky imo , so not a selling point to me, 
  it so ** was ** a selling point for me . 
  arrange to see a movie with friends all in-line , instead of having one person look up times and relay to the rest of the group ? 
  yes please !, 
  roll a d20 between player and dm where everyone can publicly see the result ? 
  thanks !, 
  but without being able to use it on my computer , any selling points are moot . 
  tying allo to your phone number was the biggest mistake they made in my opinion . 
  yeah . 
  i do n't expect or want expandable ram in a laptop , but it 's not going anywhere in conventional tower desktops , and those are n't going anywhere soon . 
  i do n't , but that 's because allo has * other * problems with it that mean i ca n't really use allo . 
  i really * want * to be able to use it , mainly * for * the assistant . 
  why not both ? 
  you 're absolutely right that the term `` country '' is a little vague . 
  most brits will tell you that england , scotland , wales , and northern ireland are all `` countries '' . 
  most non-brits i 've talked to vehemently deny that being the case -- they 're more like glorified states ( states in the sense that america or australia uses it , not in the sense of nation-state ) . 
  does n't change the fact that the european union is unambiguously * not * a country , a nation , or a state . 
  a nice write-up , i 'd say . 
  the only thing i disagree with is the sorcerer . 
  i thought it was a really interesting class , and i 'd probably be far quicker to play a sorcerer than a wizard specifically because of metamagic . 
  wild magic is also really really cool in my opinion . 
  i 'm glad to see you liked the warlock so much . 
  it 's my absolute favourite class purely for its * incredible * amount of flavour . 
  i 'm not a big fan of the great old one patron , since it skirts around what i see as the entire point of playing a warlock -- having to make a pact and stick to it , even if your patron demands you do something you 'd rather not . 
  but the other two phb patrons are great . 
  the warlock and paladin are two of the coolest classes , in my opinion , just because they both have this perfect built-in narrative hook that makes them a really engaging and interesting concept , while also mechanically being some of the best options out there . 
  since you said you 're only just getting in to 5e , you may not be aware of all the content there is for it . 
  the sword coast adventurer 's guide is the first place to look for extra archetypes . 
  there 's one more barbarian archetype ( battlerager ) as well as more options at each level for the totem warrior . 
  a new cleric domain : arcana . 
  a new fighter archetype : purple dragon knight , with the recommendation that you rename it bannerett , if you 're not in the realms . 
  the monk gets two . 
  way of the long death and way of the sun soul . 
  paladins get the oath of the crown . 
  rogues get swashbuckler and mastermind . 
  warlocks add the undying patron .
