  and wizards add the bladesinger . 
  after that , the only other new archetypes have been beta/playtest material . 
  wizards of the coast releases a series of articles called unearthed arcana , which is for material that is n't necessary completely balanced , which they are releasing to the public for free in order to get feedback about the balance , with the hope of taking the best of it , tweaking it , and releasing it officially in the future . 
  the swashbuckler rogue and storm sorcerer i mentioned above from the scag were originally released in an unearthed arcana article . 
  i notice you saw one of the ranger articles , but you did n't say which . 
  there have been a few different attempts at ranger . 
  did yours have a feature at level 1 called [ `` ambuscade '' ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/dx_0907_ua_rangeroptions.pdf ) ? 
  or did it look [ mostly like the phb , but with better rules for the beastmaster 's beast ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/ua_revisedranger.pdf ) improving over time ? 
  the latter is the most recent , and most people tend to think of it as the best option out there for rangers currently , with the ambuscade ranger generally being regarded as very overpowered . 
  [ here is the complete archive of unearthed arcana articles ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana ) . 
  the most recent ones will be the most interesting to you , since they have been going through every class in the phb adding more archetypes for them . 
  also possibly of interest is [ the mystic ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/psionics_and_mystic_v2.pdf ) , which is what they 're calling the psion in this edition . 
  the latest version of it only goes up to level 10 , but we 're expecting a third update of it to come some time in the next few weeks , probably going all the way to level 20 . 
  also of interest may be [ prestige classes and the runic mage ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) . 
  unfortunately , in the feedback for this , the idea of prestige classes was not well received , so it 's unlikely that this will be seeing daylight again any time soon . 
  but since you mentioned rune mages , i thought it was worth mentioning . 
  for content other than subclasses , you can also see the [ elemental evil player 's companion ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ee_playerscompanion.pdf ) , which has a few more races and spells that have been officially released . 
  the rules do n't support that because the main combat rules are not about that scenario . 
  they 're about the situation in which two groups of creatures are tactically fighting each other . 
  sneaking up on a single opponent outside of combat , where you can carefully place your attack such that it hits a critical part of the target and instantly kills them does n't mess with that basic part of d&d 's combat system , and it makes perfect logical sense . 
  never mind that . 
  i want to see them boycott * reddit * . 
  it has ( [ as a * corporation * ] ( / r/blog/comments / 5r43td/an _ open_letter_to_the_reddit_community / ) , not just the majority of its users ) been vocally against the policies and rhetoric of hate pushed by the trump administration . 
  you want to boycott people who disagree with your hateful opinion ? 
  as a side note , does anyone else think that a private subreddit should be automatically excluded from being a trending subreddit ? 
  hatemongering or not , the fact that anyone ca n't just go in and view the subreddit should make it ineligible . 
   what would actually happen is that bob spends 10-20 seconds carefully positioning his dagger above krusk 's eye socket , and then plunges it into his face . 
  it does n't matter if krusk has 200 or more hitpoints at this juncture , because a living entity is dead . 
  yup , precisely . 
  as long as they are outside combat , so they can afford to spend that time lining the shot up perfectly ( and do n't have to worry about defending themselves from attacks from others ) , if they can successfully sneak up on something , it 's an insta-kill . 
  though i do n't allow this for creatures without an obvious weak point . 
  any humanoid or \u2264 medium-sized beast can be dealt with in this way , but i would n't allow it on dragons or other monstrous creatures that are a little bit ... meatier , just because , as far as i 'm concerned , they would n't be able to find such an easy obvious weakness , like a humanoid has with their neck or eye socket . 
   or , you know , add allo 's messaging protocols to hangouts , allowing you to do both, 
  would that let you use assistant ? 
  because that 's literally the only reason i * want * to use allo . 
  some of the other stuff would be nice , but i mainly want to have a bot to help with arranging times to go to the movies in group chats , and a dice roller bot for chat-based roleplaying . 
   i am of the opinion that if the sorc is fine ` as is ' then why is it that all the other post seems to home in on it ? 
  if the sorc was fine , it would n't be so contentious a topic . 
  huh ? 
  that does n't follow . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  it seems to me that people would criticise that point most specifically because people are * very * satisfied with the sorcerer as-is . 
  anyway , before i go any further , i will say that seeing [ op 's second comment on the matter ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 5rekfm/some _ thoughts_on_5e_classes_implementation / dd6pgnx / ) somewhat changed my opinion . 
  i definitely think that something as op described in that comment would be * really * interesting , if it could be done right . 
   i do feel that we need atleast one more meta-magic choice . . maybe at 5th or 6th level . 
  i like this idea , but i would also say that we 'd probably need more options to choose from if they were going to do that . 
  otherwise , it would mean you end up choosing all but 3 of the total options , which would only exacerbate the problem you go on to describe next , since when you 're essentially choosing 3 options * not * to take , and there are a handful of obvious duds , pretty much everyone is going to end up with the same selection . 
   there are obvious answers as to which meta-magics to choose and this is a problem imo pointing to poor game design, 
  yes and no . 
  in general , obvious `` correct '' choices are problematic . 
  but even before looking at metamagic specifically , there are some other `` obvious '' choices in the game . 
  any warlock except * maybe * bladelocks has the `` correct '' choice to take agonising blast . 
  rangers have the `` obvious '' choice of the * hunter 's mark * spell . 
  looking at metamagic now , i can easily see four choices that are `` optimal '' in nearly all circumstances . 
  careful spell gives you the equivalent of the evocation wizard 's sculpt spell , which is useful for any sorcerer who 's going to be using aoe damage spells . 
  empowered spell gives you significantly increased damage , especially on your higher level spells that involve a lot of dice . 
  quickened spell allows you to effectively cast two spells in a turn , * dramatically * increasing your damage output ( even if at least one of those spells has to be a cantrip ) . 
  and twinned spell lets you target two people where normally you could only target one . 
  useful for both some damage spells and for utility buffs . 
  more situationally , extended spell could be useful . 
  instead of casting a spell that lasts 1 minute -- enough to last one encounter , usually -- it can last all day . 
  and heightened spell is an option i would have included in the previous bunch , except that it 's so expensive in terms of metamagic points . 
  it 's * super * useful . 
  i 'll also add that in my campaign setting , where magic is outlawed , subtle spell is * incredibly * useful . 
  also useful for anyone who needs to remain stealthy for whatever reason in more conventional settings . 
  that leaves distant spell as the only * true * dud for me , with distant spell and subtle spell as the only duds in most situations . 
  anyway , i like that we 're having this conversation . 
  your points about wild magic are certainly valid , and while i 've never seen the sorlock multiclass myself in person , i can appreciate why many would see it as immensely powerful . 
  yeah for real . 
  i think other sorcerer is pretty great already , but that description sounds so much more awesome . 
  i 'm not completely sure it could be done well , but if it could it would rock !, 
  personally i think metamagic is a perfect name for the ability . 
  it 's magic that affects other magic . 
  literally meta magic . 
  but i think you 're absolutely right about them often preferring tradition over what they think makes the most sense . 
  not just in naming abilities , but also in choosing how mechanics work . 
  for example , [ warlocks using charisma ] ( https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/810215324784193536 ) ( though personally i do prefer it working that way for flavour reasons ) . 
  probably other examples out there too . 
   this means that the ` countries ' of the united kingdom ( perhaps other than england , depending on how one slices it ) lack the fundamental status of states . 
  in this way , the countries of the uk have less basis for autonomy than a state member of a federated state, 
  ironically , england actually , in a way , has * less * power over the union than scotland does . 
  scotland has its devolved parliament which can rule on certain issues specific to scotland . 
  but there are also many seats within the uk house of commons from electorates in scotland . 
  the commons is the * only * body that can rule on national issues to england , in addition to being the uk 's unifying body . 
  it 's really quite an amusing relationship they have . 
   silence + invisibility now auto-kills, 
  first of all , that 's an impossible combination for one character , due to both spells requiring concentration . 
  but even if two characters get involved , it 's only an auto-kill if the target is asleep or otherwise completely unable to move , * and * it 's done outside of combat . 
   conjuration specialists with the keen mind feat can now conjure working spellbooks to copy from if they glimpsed it out the corner of their eye once . 
  nope . 
  why would they be able to ? 
  even if you decide that spellbooks are non-magical ( i would rule that they * are * magical , if only in a minor way ) , seeing the outside of a book does not mean you can recreate the entire internal contents of it . 
   cast enlarge on the cornerstone of a castle and the whole place collapses , killing everyone inside, 
  if it 's a poorly-built castle , sure , why not ? 
  that 's a really clever use !, 
  it 's not even a reading between the lines . 
  the spell literally just says it makes things bigger . 
  if it is a well-built castle , i 'd say the stone gets forced to pop out of its space , and nothing else particularly happens . 
   stone shape suddenly becomes the iron maiden ... of doom, 
  you 've still got to get your victim into the iron maiden , and making the thing using that spell sounds exactly like a correct reading of the spell .
