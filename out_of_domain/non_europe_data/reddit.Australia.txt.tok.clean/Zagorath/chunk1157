  sounds fine . 
   polymorph a whale into a snail , teleport to a dragon , toss it into the dragon 's mouth , collect free ( albeit gore-covered ) hoard . 
  first you 've got to find a whale , find a dragon , successfully teleport to that dragon , hope the dragon is asleep , hope the dragon has a worthwhile hoard , manage to open the dragon 's mouth and throw the snail in without waking it up , all within an hour . 
  and even after all that , if you somehow succeed ( there are multiple stages in there in which a dm could easily and very reasonably prevent success , if they do n't want it to work ) , it 'll only work if the dm decides to allow it to work . 
  could easily say that a dragon 's stomach is strong enough to withstand it . 
  they 're magical beings of immense power , after all . 
  but anyway , all these examples you 've given , save the first one and * maybe * the second one , are completely orthogonal to the point at hand . 
  they 're people using existing specific abilities in the game and asking the dm to rule on them in a particular way , which might or might not work . 
  the insta-kill thing is entirely different , for reasons that have already been explained . 
  and if you ca n't get your head around the explanation , then that 's not my problem . 
  go ahead and keep playing your game the way you are . 
  it 's such a rare situational rule that even if you are playing it in a bizarre and unrealistic way , it 's not going to ruin much . 
  it 's about `` the right boycott '' , which seems to be a subreddit for right-wing ( or , to be honest , more likely alt-right wing ) people to organise boycotts of companies that disagree with their opinion . 
  the name was kinda ambiguous though . 
  at first i thought it might be a subreddit for left-leaning people to boycott right-leaning companies . 
  tl ; dr : / r/therightboycott is a boycott * by * the right , not * of * the right . 
  i do n't call every opinion i disagree with hateful . 
  i absolutely despise libertarian ideology , for example , but it is certainly not , at its core , a hateful one . 
  hateful is a term reserved for ideologies and policies which espouse hate . 
  trump 's administration certainly fits that bill . 
  the same thing happened a week or so ago when a guy with greek heritage went on a wild drive in inner melbourne , australia . 
  before the explanation came out , a lot of people were blaming it on islam , claiming they heard him shout `` allahu akbar '' , etc. 
  turned out to be a domestic violence response gone wrong . 
  i 'll preface this by saying we have n't been playing in our new world for very long , so the rules are not set in stone as we continue to work them out . 
  a big part of the solution we came up with , though , was to make magic -- especially of the arcane sort -- rather socially unacceptable . 
  some of the mechanics and history of the world are essentially a justification for this being the case . 
  the bits for divine magic essentially provide the dm a carte blanche to say `` nope , you do n't get to cast that spell right now '' , with the understanding that we as a group trust each other not to abuse that , and that * most * of the time , any player is going to be able to use any spell they have access to , only disallowing if the dm thinks it goes against their oath or their god . 
  [ here are our general alterations to how magic works ] ( http://pastebin.com/yxj6fylf ) . 
  and [ here are our alterations to specific spells ] ( http://pastebin.com/m8t7riws ) . 
  not all of the changes we 're making are in there yet , because one player who was responsible for suggesting quite a few changes has not yet entered his suggestions to our wiki , but most of them should be . 
  oh right . 
  i must have misread it . 
  still , that still means only three real duds . 
  right , but the only one of your scenarios which even comes * close * to relying on a house-rule is the first one . 
  the rest of them are either the most obvious or the least harmful interpretations of currently unspecified or vague rulings . 
  that 's why your entire comment was basically a waste of time . 
  edit : and , if you think about it , even the first scenario is * really * a ruling on an unspecified scenario , so even that does n't make for a strong argument . 
  the only difference there is that it 's not necessarily the `` least harmful '' interpretation . 
  have you seen misfits ? 
  i only watched the first two seasons of it , but the touch of time travel involved in that was , i thought , really good . 
  hey , i do n't know if you 're aware of it , but there 's a new subreddit called / r/dndmaps that you might enjoy cross-posting to . 
  yeah it 's a really young one . 
  i think it was in the trending subreddits a few days ago or something . 
  yeah i 'm totally okay with disallowing stuff for flavour reasons . 
  but personally , assuming i 'm okay with the flavour , i would be okay with basically anything from / r/boh5e , as well as most things that seemed to get decent feedback on / r/unearthedarcana , because you can trust those to be pretty much as good as official material . 
  good place to start would be [ the / r/dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  not every story there is actually greentext but they 're all absolutely fantastic . 
  the greentext ones are the ones with a bunch of lines that are coloured green and begin with ''  '' . 
  sir bearington , the virgin wife , los tiburon , mr bones ' wild ride , and the concubine and the literal assassin are the greentext stories from the `` short stories '' section . 
  yeah that 's basically it . 
  it 's a really common storytelling format for roleplaying stories . 
  check [ this comment further down the thread ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 5ridlj/what _ are_your_favorite_dd_greentext_stories / dd7ow5g / ) for a link to find a bunch of examples . 
   # error establishing a database connection, 
  oh good , it 's not just me . 
  yeah , i think we must have . 
  it was working a couple of hours ago for me . 
  personally , when i use `` good question '' , it 's because i think the question is one which raises some interesting points . 
  a question which takes , as its assumptions , some ideas that i had not considered before , but of which i can see the merit . 
   what 's a roundabout, 
  is this a real question ? 
  i was really embarrassed by tony abbott when he was our prime minister . 
  he was so incredibly un-primeministerial in his behaviour in * so * many ways . 
  but holy fucking shit . 
  trump is on an entire different level ; nay , he 's not even playing the same * game * as abbott was . 
  it 's really quite astonishing . 
  parliamentary systems are really fantastic . 
  even aside from the `` you can replace a leader the moment you realise they 're a fucking moron '' and the `` parliament chooses the head of government rather than directly from the election '' aspects , it 's ** really ** useful to have the executive chosen from within the legislative . 
  america has this really strong notion ( in theory ... trump seems not to care about it quite so much ) of separation of powers , which is a pretty cool idea in theory , but can lead to a horrible deadlock where government is incapable of functioning properly , if the legislature is being run by a different party to the executive . 
  obama was a great president , but he would have been an even better prime minister , because so much of what he * wanted * to do was prevent by congress . 
  a politically neutral governor-general who can step in if things get * really * out of hand is pretty nice , too . 
  ( although , as australia saw in 1975 , it can be abused if the gg does n't properly adhere to convention , and the westminster system relies pretty heavily on convention ... and i 'm not exactly sure that 's feasible in america 's political climate . 
  swings and roundabouts , i guess . ), 
  has anything come out about how those other calls went ? 
  you can also force it to look for exactly a certain word or phrase ( no synonyms or having the same words in a different order ) by putting `` those words in double quotes '' . 
  and you can look for stuff 9n a particular website by adding ` site : reddit.com ` or whatever site you want , to the search . 
  these are not legitimate risks to worry a out . 
  a well made electronic system can be just as robust in these respects as the current voting system . 
  the only * real * dealbreaker to electronic voting is the threat of infection on a voter 's computer , which unfortunately can not really be helped . 
  is mod approving * any * soft-banned site grounds for a banning of the sub ? 
  because i regularly approve ( self ) posts with links to that image macro hosting site that was banned a while back for spurious reasons . 
  i forget its name right now . 
  meme-something , i think . 
  i always figured that was totally fine , since the reason we were told ( by mods of large subreddits -- not by the admins ) for the ban was vote manipulation , and in my case they 're all within self posts used for punctuating a point . 
  i had no idea it might be against the rules to press `` approve '' on something that has only been soft banned . 
  well the most obvious answer would be the [ call to the cows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd3gertnaai ) from rossini 's `` william tell '' . 
  if you enjoy that , i would recommend checking out more from william tell . 
  in particular , the [ overture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xobe69wdskq ) is really well known and enjoyable . 
  william tell is an opera , which is basically the classical music equivalent of a musical . 
  the overture , in both operas and musicals , typically presents a bunch of the themes that will be used throughout the rest of the work . 
  in the case of william tell , the overture is in 4 parts . 
  you 'll hear the call to the cows in part 3 . 
  you 'll also hear part 4 , which is another highly recognisable piece , famous for being associated with cavalry charges . 
  if you enjoy the william tell overture , i would also recommend giving a go to offenbach 's [ orpheus in the underworld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=venw5_gtooi ) , which ends in the famous can-can . 
  over all though , this piece bears more in common with the * first half * of the william tell , so if you did n't enjoy that bit , you might want to give this a miss . 
  back to things directly similar to grieg 's morning mood , you might enjoy the [ second movement of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  7 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mghxmasindk ) . 
  and if you enjoy that , go ahead and try out the rest of the symphony . 
  if you enjoy * that * , try out the rest of beethoven 's symphonies . 
  3 , 5 , 6 , and of course 9 are generally regarded as the best . 
  you might particularly enjoy [ the sixth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbfa86btd34 ) , which is subtitled `` pastoral '' and has a lot of really nice calming melodies .
