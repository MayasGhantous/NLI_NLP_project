  perhaps more than any of beethoven 's other symphonies , the sixth is best enjoyed in its entirety ( though certainly , if you can , * any * of them is best listened to as a complete whole , it 's just that the 6th tells a fairly definitive story , which you can tell if you read the five movement 's subtitles , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._6_ ( beethoven \\ ) #form ) ) . 
  [ here is a thread ] ( / r/classicalresources/comments / 13g73q/themes _ soothingrelaxing / ) on the fantastic subreddit / r/classicalresources , which contains a list of a bunch more `` soothing/relaxing '' pieces . 
  there might be some other posts on that subreddit with themes that you enjoy . 
  classical music is a * huge * field , and this is only a really small selection of pieces selected from a small slice of moods . 
  you 've got a fantastic journey ahead of you if you 're interested in continuing on . 
  i ca n't say i 'm not a little jealous of that !, 
  it 's easy to construct some artificial scenario like that if you want . 
  what 's to stop someone in person from looking over ? 
  sure , you 're not * supposed * to , but i 've never heard of that being enforced . 
  or if you ca n't be there next to them , then from asking for a photo of the ballot . 
  you do n't get to start out by criticising your collocutor for `` trying to be edgy '' ( which i personally find rather ironic , since that statement itself comes across as trying to be edgy ) , and then try to get out of it on top by saying `` but that 's also just my opinion . '', 
  or just a flat fee . 
  or , as george lucas so cleverly did , get the rights to all merchandising . 
  then i 'm a little confused about how this honey pot worked . 
  they soft-banned a site , so why is mods approving it on their sub a problem ? 
  do it !, 
  it 's never been easier to get in to the hobby !, 
  go down to your local game store ( or just search on an online store that sells games ) and grab a copy of the d&d starter set . 
  that gives you one basic rule book , some premade characters , a premade adventure which is * really * easy to run , and a set of dice . 
  find 3 -- 5 friends who are interested , grab some snack food , and away you go !, 
  a slightly more complete version of the [ d&d basic rules can be found for free online ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules ) , both for players and for dms . 
  once you 've played for a little while and decided you like the game , the player 's handbook , monster manual , and dungeon master 's guide can be picked up pretty easily . 
  that makes a lot of sense . 
  very clever . 
  i ca n't comment on pr people , but personally i do n't think i 've heard politicians use the phrase `` great question '' except in response to dorothy dixers . 
  normally when they 're asked a question by the opposition they do n't tend to say `` great question '' . 
  but i might just be misremembering . 
  you should n't use wikipedia as a source in school because you should n't use * any * tertiary resource as a source . 
  it can be a good launching point , but wikipedia cites its own sources , and you should read and understand those , before citing * them * as your source . 
  in fact , i think it has a significant * disadvantage * . 
  since all the common letters are clumped up next to each other -- all the vowels especially , but also many of the consonants -- it 's much harder to type in the optimal way , which , for smartphones , is * not * about accuracy of your fingers , but instead to smash away in the general direction , and rely on autocorrection algorithms . 
  it 's this reliance on autocorrect that also means the advantage of apostrophes being more prominently placed is completely moot . 
  season 1 , by far . 
  guardian has been an awful subplot , i was sadly underwhelmed by the way m'gann was revealed/characterised , cat was such a fantastic part of the show . 
  but perhaps most importantly , i just felt like season 1 was really focussed on supergirl and kara as a character herself , while season 2 has focussed a little too much on her relationships ( not necessarily of the romantic sort ) with the other characters around her , which has n't worked as well as i would have liked . 
  yeah i have to agree with basically everything you 've said here . 
  i actually * do * enjoy the mon-el stuff . 
  i 'm intrigued to know exactly why the people on the alien planet deliberately let him go , i think that 's quite interesting . 
  but everything else , about it being unfocussed , about plot lines just disappearing or fizzling out , was really spot on . 
  that 's it !, 
  haha . 
  your flair on mobile just said `` quickmeme '' , but i just had a look on desktop . 
  did you actually have something to do with quickmeme 's banning ? 
  no this is actually a far , ** far ** worse option than rolling and having bounds on legal rolls . 
  it means the randomness is quite literally `` which characters are the best and which are the worst '' , whereas if everyone rolls , but has a reroll if they are too strong/too weak , it 's about randomness of the distribution of scores , but everyone is more or less equally strong . 
  `` you 're fired '' is a reference to trump 's reality tv days , where that was essentially his catch phrase . 
  it also makes sense if you think of it as being `` fired '' as allies of the us . 
  '' ** total . 
  ** 6 encounters , 4800 xp '' seems to be bleeding onto the third column for me , at the very end . 
  nah , this is a cheap imitation of the real thing . 
  note the second underscore . 
  oh come on mate . 
  now you 're not even trying to appear sincere . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  you should also probably be aware that , in the general sense , it 's best to just * assume * anything found on dandwiki is terrible . 
  most of it is . 
  if you want good homebrew , look for it directly on this subreddit , and check for stuff that has received a lot of positive feedback , or look on / r/boh5e . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  you can include the type of thing that you 're creating in the title and our automod will do its best to pick the right flair . 
  alternatively , you can click the little `` flair '' button below the post and select the appropriate one from there . 
  any decent mobile app should have something equivalent to this , as well . 
   many of the same issues as ms office documents, 
  worse , actually , since office disables macros by default and asks you to manually enable them . 
  pdfs have scripting capabilities that ca n't really be turned off easily . 
   it 's because it opens in an external app, 
  when was the last time this was true ? 
  three or four years ago ? 
  all good browsers can open pdfs in a tab these days . 
  the biggest advantage of images is that on reddit especially , you can view it in-line just by clicking the little preview button . 
  when you enlarge a photo , you know how it gets kinda blurry ? 
  the technical name for that blur is `` artefacts '' . 
  this dude 's an absolute nutter . 
  i have him res tagged as just '' [ lol ] ( / r/linux/comments / 4qqpep/linux _ is_now_the_2 / d4v9ims ) '', 
  two obscure references ? 
  the game of life is something almost * everyone * who 's been programming or in programming communities for a while will have heard of . 
  and sugar gliders are hardly some really weird obscure animal ... maybe obscure if you do n't speak english natively . 
  oh for sure . 
  i would definitely prefer a pdf to an image . 
  i was simply pointing out that , theoretically , pdfs are less secure than word documents ( with the unstated but implied observation that word documents are , in turn , less secure than images ) . 
  the best method would be to have the submission link be an image , since more people will click that way , and then have a pdf link in the comments . 
  i 've said for a long time that the ib programme would be greatly improved if students could choose to ignore ** any ** one group entirely , and make it up with a second subject from another group . 
  let people who just really do n't want to do a second language not be forced to do it . 
  the fact that currently the * only * group people are allowed to opt out of is the arts is frankly insulting . 
  not to mention it 's the only group people are not allowed to do two of , and the fact that if you want to do two from anywhere else , it automatically means it * has * to be the arts that you drop . 
  want to do biology and chemistry , to help get in to medicine ? 
  well sorry , but you 're not allowed to take music any more . 
  want further maths ( which means also doing hl maths ) ? 
  nope , no drama for you . 
  what 's that , you 'd rather drop second language french ? 
  nope , sorry . 
  i still think the waterborne adventures is one of the best uas we 've had , and i thought this was the general consensus . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that it 's had * two * pieces from it released officially ( and with only minor tweaks ) . 
  more recent options might be more mechanically powerful , but i 've felt that most of them have been much less thematically interesting . 
  i never saw the survey when it was posted , so i 'm curious , is this `` most loved '' and `` most hated '' stuff about flavour , mechanics , or both ? 
  i 'd argue that the most useful data would include both * separately * , rather than combined . 
  for example , i 'm sure the bard is a perfectly fine class mechanically , but it is , imo , the flat out worst class there is in terms of flavour . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how the divisiveness that your survey found for the bard would change if it 's explicitly asking about how people feel about its * mechanics * , and then separately asking about its flavour .
