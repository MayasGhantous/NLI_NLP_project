  where you see a problem , i see * fantastic * design . 
  most fantasy worlds typically see a majority human population , but in other editions of d&d ( and even in 5e , if you only allow the so-called `` default '' human ) , humans are surprisingly rare , because they are mechanically pretty uninteresting , as well as thematically not too great . 
  making them a strong mechanical choice , as well as allowing for the extra thematics that having a feat at level 1 allows people to feel like they 're losing less by playing a human . 
  indeed , like they 're * gaining * something by playing human . 
  and that makes the average adventuring party somewhat more closely resemble what you might * expect * an adventuring party to look like , in a human-dominated world . 
  that seems like a dumb convention to me ... 
  i 've always written commit messages in the past perfect tense . 
   what did this commit do ? 
   [ it ] fixed [ an ] issue with [ the ] fan . 
  reads much more nicely and makes much more sense than using imperative ... 
   i also do n't understand why rogues are the defacto `` best '' in any given area . 
  this is what really bothers me . 
  the idea that , no matter how hard a wizard tries , he can * never * be as good at arcana as a rogue who chooses to specialise in the same . 
  ditto with a cleric in religion vs a rogue , etc. 
  the indro kfc is right next to a red rooster , which is clearly the superior option anyway . 
   tieflings often have tells like horns or a tail . 
  aasimar also often have tells , like angel wings or a slight glow, 
  tieflings in 5e 's forgotten realms ( and the default assumption by which the race is built ) * almost universally * have both horns and a tail . 
  only the few tieflings whose bloodline was * first * created more recently than asmodeus 's apotheosis ( at the start of 4th edition d&d ) can possibly be any different than that . 
  tieflings based on the 5e phb ( as opposed to the various unearthed arcanas that have come up with variant tieflings ) are all * really * obviously tieflings , since a tail and horns are pretty hard to hide , as are their solid coloured eyes . 
  i know what you 're getting at when you say aasimar are like the reverse of tieflings . 
  it seems like it * should * be that way . 
  but unfortunately unless it 's wings , angels do n't have the same kind of really identifiable traits as devils , which makes it harder for aasimar to mirror tieflings * visually * like they do in abilities . 
  i rather like the idea of them having a soft glow , though . 
  i might just steal that . 
   but that 's exactly what multiclassing is for . 
  devoting your study to one thing , to the detriment of another, 
  well , sorta . 
  if you consider expanding your breadth of knowledge at the expense of your depth in one area to be `` devoting your study to one thing '' . 
  because that 's really what multiclassing is . 
  sacrificing depth in the area of your main class 's specialty for the breadth ( including neat synergies of abilities ) of having abilities from another class . 
  a wizard * is * a specialist in the arcane , just like a cleric is a specialist in religion . 
  rogues are experts in precision in combat , first and foremost , with expertise in abilities as a secondary attribute . 
  a wizard or cleric should not have to forego increasing their ability at spellcasting to gain sneak attack , just to also be able to be as good at arcana/religion as a rogue is . 
  the very notion that it 's * impossible * for a wizard to beat a rogue in arcana unless he also decides he wants to be able to sneak attack is kinda ludicrous . 
   if you descended from a sea-celestial , you do n't just have `` eyes like an ocean '' in the metaphorical sense ; if someone looks closely , they 'll see that your irises undulate like waves , and they are deeply green-blue , easy to get lost in . 
  if your ancestor is related to fire , your hair is n't described are firey just because it 's got the right tone ; it has all the nuances of an inferno , flutters like flames in the wind . 
  if you 're related to a love deity , your body fits the beauty ideal of your society ( which could vary a lot ) too perfectly . 
  maybe a woman has unnaturally red lips , a man has muscles that are just too well-defined to be natural . 
   and all of these features could be even more obvious when you 're using magical abilities . 
  eyes shine like small suns , tattoos are aglow with starlight , your black skin shines like obsidian , your hair literally burns with fire , snow swirls around you even in the middle of summer . 
  oh boy i just ** love ** this idea !, 
  a couple of really cool ideas there !, 
   they 're taking about the imperative mood, 
  / u/vgambit was n't . 
  `` a commit does a thing '' is not an imperative , it 's indicative . 
  that 's what / u/weepitywop was pointing out . 
  the sentence / u/vgambit used is not an argument in favour of using the imperative for commit messages . 
  `` bright moon '' lol , nice name , 
  if they wanted it to be a single flat wall , without any ambiguity , why would they not just have said `` you can shape a single flat rectangle of area 1,000 square feet . '', 
  that would have been so much clearer . 
  if you 're not allowed to put angles between each of the 10 panels , why would they describe it as though there are 10 separate panels ? 
   we need a nolan chart , people !, 
  better to use the political compass . 
  it portrays more or less the same information , but in an unbiased way . 
  the nolan chart is some god-awful libertarian propaganda . 
   both get nothing, 
  this seems ... unlikely . 
  stv does not suffer the spoiler effect . 
  it 's more probable that whichever of them gets slightly fewer votes would pass them on to the other . 
  having lived in east and south-east asia for a substantial portion of my life , can confirm . 
  asians can be * super * racist . 
  not against white people , normally , which is why you probably wo n't notice it if you 're there for a few weeks as a tourist , but against ethnic minorities and to a lesser extent south asians and other `` darker '' people . 
  i just wan na point out that buzzfeed uses their infamous clickbaity bullshit listacles as a way to fund serious journalism . 
  hmm , good point . 
  every weapon except clubs , and maybe other club-like weapons ( maces , warhammers , etc. 
  ) , anyway . 
  i would tend to agree with / u/matsif . 
  just allow it if that 's what you want to do . 
  but personally , i take exception to the idea that oberyn martell would be a fighter . 
  personally , i think he 's a damn perfect example of a monk . 
  he 's really hard to hit , despite no armour . 
  clearly his wisdom is helping there , because dex alone is n't enough to help him that much . 
  and he fights with a huge amount of movement and showiness . 
  he might not culturally fit what we think of as the east asian monk , but he fits the mechanics perfectly . 
  and it 's characters like him who make me think that the sort of person that claim `` monks do n't make sense in d&d '' are ridiculous . 
  i think this might be a slight case of the xy problem , in so much as i think the question op really * meant * to ask was should it be in the ogl ? 
  with that assumption , neither your answer nor / u/ct _ phoenix 's actually help to answer the question , which is an interesting one . 
  why , if you 're releasing the content as free to * use * , would you not also just throw it out to the ogl for people to use ? 
  limiting the amount of phb/mm/dmg content in the ogl makes sense . 
  it encourages people to buy those books . 
  but when people can already play using this content for free , that reasoning is n't there . 
  now there 's a good answer to the question !, 
  out of interest , does anyone know when settlers of catan became really popular in english ? 
  i need to know if i was accidentally a hipster or not . 
  i first played it with a german friend around 2005/6 . 
  at the time , i had never heard of it before , and i do n't * think * i ever heard of it again for another four or five years , but that could just be because i 've never really been a huge board gamer . 
  anyway , thanks for sharing !, 
  pretty great video . 
  i 'm just gon na pretend you 're actually grey and that we finally got the greatest video ** of all time ** that we 've been anticipating for so long . 
  am i wrong in assuming that everything in the basic rules is also in the srd ? 
  maybe i am , it 's been a while since i 've looked very closely at either document , but i thought the srd was a superset of the basic rules . 
  captain planet is clearly fey though , not fiend . 
  * wall of water * is in volo 's ? 
  what page ? 
  are there other spells in it i might have missed ? 
  and you can make that even more once you reach level 5 , thanks to the way eb scales . 
  or , alternatively , push * two * guys back that far . 
  it 's also not really a paradox , but just a case of people looking at the problem wrong . 
   as some others have said , lol and overwatch posts often do n't make sense to people unfamiliar with the game ,,
