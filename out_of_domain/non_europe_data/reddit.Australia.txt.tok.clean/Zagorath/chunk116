   we 're defiantly not rich, 
  we refuse to be rich !, 
  i dunno about other alcohols but i 've certainly seen it said that one glass of red wine a day is good for you . 
  no it 's between the first half of season one and the second half of season one . 
  they 're calling them books one and two , but technically it 's one season . 
  [ no , it 's not .

  ca n't we celebrate my friend 's birthday , who was actually born on december 25th ? 
  imagine if op 's mum needed 100 copies ... 
  wait , your friend is a biochemist -- who * does n't * believe in evolution ? 
  * sigh *, 
  actually , we 're not overpopulated . 
  the carrying capacity of humans is most often estimated to be from 10 -- 15 billion , with extremes ranging from 1 billion to 1 trillion . 
  our problem is resource distribution , not total resource use . 
  change which letter you double and it 's a musical instrument . 
  yep, 
  no he 's still wrong . 
  `` recently deleted '', 
  ooh !, 
  what the british call `` courgettes '' we call zucchinis . 
  i dunno where the yanks sit on that one . 
  primary school ? 
  i did this up until the last 3 years of secondary school , and even then some subjects would do that kind of stuff ( usually a movie related to the subject ) . 
  anyone know what the fair dealing laws in australia cover ? 
  e ^ 2 = p ^ 2 . 
  c ^ 2 + m ^ 2 . 
  in real life [ arrows bend and wobble a lot ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co102jz8sfm ) . 
  so yeah ... `` straight as an arrow '' . 
  our `` illegal '' immigrants . 
  nobody outside australia , perhaps . 
  anyone who follows aussie politics even in passing has heard of nauru . 
  take a hint from the australian green party . 
  brilliant legitimate party with significant representation in the senate and they won their first ever seat in the reps at our last election . 
  [ beethoven piano sonata no . 
  14 `` moonlight '' , movement 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80zmsda5q8q ) . 
  so sad , but so beautiful . 
  a lovely funeral march ( at least according to [ andras schiff ] ( http://download.guardian.co.uk/sys-audio/arts/culture/2006/11/22/03_14csharpmin.mp3 ) , who i 'm inclined to agree with ) . 
  wow thanks . 
  i 've a huge beethoven fan , but i 've never heard of this piece before ( probably because of my disinterest in vocal music , for the most part ) , but i quite like this . 
  [ links ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzcfydwf48c ) for the [ lazy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgd4rs-o3ws ) . 
  but i do n't think that 's lame at all , they 're great pieces of music , both of them . 
  any particular movement for winter , or the whole thing ? 
  i have to say , i think if i were a violinist the four seasons in their entirety would be a great pick for last piece to play , particularly if you started with spring and end with winter ( as i believe was the intention , but i 'm not sure ) . 
  a beautiful piece . 
  i absolutely love the tension in those falling notes , and the response from the orchestra . 
  great version , by the way , i love bernstein !, 
  also really nice , if you do n't already know about it ( though not nearly as amazing as the concerto , imo ) , is mozart 's clarinet quintet ( the first and second movements are really similar to the first and second movements of the concerto , particularly the [ second movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jgdihmgdk0 ) ) . 
  i 've never heard of walton before , but i love the viola -- it 's a sadly underrated instrument . 
  have you a favourite version of this on youtube ? 
  at the moment i 'm waiting for the first complete version that came up when i did a search to load . 
  an interesting question , but i 'm inclined to think not . 
  while the velocity is greater at the equator , the rate at which the angle from the centre of the earth to a given point in spaces changes should be the same . 
  each shot was 8 seconds , but how many shots total did you end up taking ? 
  edit : and what time did you start/finish ? 
  honestly the best thing would be to ask him if he can share the original image . 
  it 's easy for people to crop and resize their own versions from there . 
  i had my screen 's colours inverted ( for better reading in the dark ) , and oh god this picture is even scarier like that . 
   gillard wanted to vote against palestinians ' membership but the rest of her party wants to vote for it . 
  i was wondering what australia 's position on that was . 
  the only list of votes i saw was that of the countries which opposed it , and i was glad to see we were n't in there . 
  how did australia end up voting ? 
  did we abstain or vote yes ? 
  words sometimes have different connotations . 
  it 's amazing . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's simply not true . 
  for whatever reason they 've decided that for korra each season will consist of two books . 
  as an australian the british ones are my * second * favourite . 
  they 're brilliant , they stay in the wall absolutely perfectly . 
  the problem is they 're so fucking huge . 
  and from what i 've seen they seem to * always * have the ground , even on products that in many other places would n't . 
  for that reason i prefer the australian plug , which is smaller and the ground is optional , but sticks in place equally well . 
  well yeah , of course , but that 's kinda my point . 
  the british plug is the only one i 've seen where if the product does n't need a ground , you still have to have the plug . 
  most others do n't . 
  the '' \\ ^ '' for making things superscript works differently to other markup on reddit . 
  you need to either write \\ ^ ( text here ) , or put the \\ ^ symbol \\ ^ before \\ ^ every \\ ^ word .

  yeah , cats are definitely not friendly . 
  except when they 're begging for food , or to be let outside . 
  valve 's like a cat in that the internet loves it , but i ca n't really see any links after that . 
  now , what 's an animal that never comes in groups of more than 2 ? 
  they just call them `` avatars '' i think . 
  really original . 
  i 'm a really light steam user . 
  most of my games are non-steam , and the best features for me are talking with friends while gaming and taking in-game screenshots with a centralised organisation of all my captures . 
  make sure you know steam 's shortcut for taking screenshots if this is something that even slightly interests you . 
  i 'd agree with mr yolo about not buying anything on steam until you 're comfortable with the system and how everything works . 
  tf2 is an awesome game , heaps of people play it , and it 's completely free unless you want to buy random items that are , for the most part , cosmetic . 
  once ( if ) you do decide to fork over your credit card details , i would always recommend not buying any game for full price . 
  wait until it 's on sale , unless it 's * brand new * and you really want to play it straight away . 
  steam regularly has sales on heaps of games , so keep a look out . 
  edit : i got portal for free because they were giving it away one weekend . 
  they often have free-to-play weekends on games where you can play the game for the weekend but not `` own '' it , which is a great way to get introduced to new games . 
  this particular case with portal was actually you get to `` own '' it if you download it during that weekend . 
  note : i use `` own '' loosely -- you never really own digital content in the same way you own physical things . 
  probably not , really . 
  i mainly game on pc , on my gaming desktop . 
  when i 'm travelling i bring my laptop , which is a mac , with me , so i pick games that run on that . 
  most games for computer that have a mac edition give you both in one , so paying extra is n't a worry for me personally .
