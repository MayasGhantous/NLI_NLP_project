  seriously . 
  i just went to the lol subreddit and read [ the top comment in a post about something called a `` female support sub '' ] ( / r/leagueoflegends/comments / 5ses5q/til _ unicorns_of_love_have_a_female_support_sub / ddervvv ) . 
  it 's like she 's speaking an entirely different language . 
   since last year summer split, 
   they never were training with the team , or never got in the gaming house for example, 
   the entire 5th paragraph, 
   tldr : not gon na play lcs , main job : uol designer, 
  huh ? 
  hey mate , you seem to have forgotten to include an actual link . 
  i 've removed this post for now . 
  if you edit the link in , let me know so i can approve it . 
  considering how many times i 've seen angry comments from people claiming that if you 're driving 100 in a 100 zone ( but when the majority of traffic is travelling at 110 ) , or travelling at 105 in a 110 zone , clearly a lot of people ** do not ** consider the fact that a speed limit is legally a * maximum * to be relevant . 
  so many people ( including on here and in / r/brisbane ) argue very strongly that it 's really a * target * speed . 
  edit : see below for examples of said angry comments . 
  i 'm still a learner , but the advice my parents have given me was to target two or three ks under the speed limit in built up areas . 
  you 'll fluctuate up and down a little , but even when it 's at its peak , you 'll still be under the limit . 
  seems to work for them . 
  only time my dad has ever gotten a speed limit , after driving for 4 decades , was the result of driving in a foreign country and not realising the speed limit had changed . 
  if by `` get out of the way '' you mean `` stay in the left lane '' , then fine . 
  anyone on a road with speed limit \u2265 90 ( e.g. , any highway ) should n't be in the right lane unless overtaking anyway . 
  but if , as seems to be the case from a lot of the angry comments i 've seen in the past , you want me to get off the road , or pull over , or some shit like that , then nope . 
  i 'm gon na continue to use the road in a legal fashion as i am entitled to do . 
   guessing you speed up when they try and get around you as well . 
  what a fucking moronic guess . 
  you would be wrong . 
   you could argue that gaia was an archfey, 
  indeed , i would . 
  great old ones , at least from what i inferred from the phb and the way people tend to talk about them on this subreddit , are more of a lovecraftian horror . 
  a power so great we ca n't really even comprehend it , and it probably does n't really care about us so much . 
  the fact that the above does n't apply to gaia , plus the fey 's common association with nature , makes it seem more like that that 's what she is . 
   plus i bet i could google `` 5e spell list by class '' or something and find a document that 's been better-organized to print out !, 
  this is annoyingly difficult , because wizards keeps forcing the closure of third party resources that help fix the problems created by their design decisions, 
   you might get some grouchiness thrown at you about 4e, 
  honestly , i have n't seen much of that lately . 
  i think that time and distance has given people some perspective . 
  there were a ** lot ** of good things it did , many of which were brought forward into 5e , even if people do n't always recognise it . 
  this post is a great example , imo . 
  the way powers were listed along with the class , instead of having to flip to an entirely different section , is a great example of classes being relatively `` self-contained '' . 
   the phoenix got the old favoured souls healing when casting a certain spell, 
  the thing i found interesting about this was that the specific wording of it -- `` when you ** expend a spell slot ** to cast a spell ... '' ( emphasis mine ) -- means that even if casting the spell fails for some reason ( e.g. 
  you delayed casting it , an then lost concentration , or you were counterspelled ) , you still get the health . 
  probably varies by state , but i looked it up when making that comment . 
  in queensland it 's 90 . 
  eh , we also have by far the best laws in the country for cyclists . 
  nsw and even victoria ( which is * supposedly * a really cyclist friendly place ) have less cyclist friendly laws in place . 
  and that 's why i stay 2 -- 3 below , rather than 5 -- 6 . 
  for what it 's worth , it would n't be totally ignorant to have him do that , as a korean , if they did want to go the route of `` this guy is our korean character and we 'll take every opportunity to show his korean-ness '' . 
  obviously that 's not a good route to go , but if they did . 
  korea shares quite a lot of culture with north eastern china . 
  they 've got ( or historically had , to be slightly more precise ) that same confucianist belief system , and until * very * recently , a knowledge of chinese writing was considered an important sign of high education . 
  a ( stereotypically ) korean character quoting an ancient chinese proverb seems pretty believable to me . 
  they did have that one episode that tried to sorta indirectly address the issue , by having riker get romantic with a member of an androgenous society with a strong taboo against showing any gender . 
  admittedly , said character did choose to be female , not male , so it was n't quite the same thing , but the analogy could n't have been much clearer . 
  was original sulu explicitly straight ? 
  i 'm currently only a few episodes in to my first full watch-through of tos , but so far his sexuality has n't been touched upon . 
  no , but i will from now on . 
  thanks !, 
  i could be wrong ( i 'm no linguist ) but i believe this is due to aussie english being overwhelmingly non-rhotic . 
  though to be honest , i 'm having a hard time even imagining how a rhotic accent would pronounce sauce and source differently . 
  other examples i can kinda wrap my head around ( letter being either letta or letterrr , for example ) , but i 'd love to hear a recording of someone with a rhotic accent say sorcerer , source , and sauce . 
  less than half of australia has it , actually . 
  western australia , queensland , and the northern territory are all smart enough to recognise what a dumb idea it is . 
  regarding the afternoon run , i agree with you . 
  i prefer running just before dinner . 
  but dst makes that worse , too . 
  you obviously want it to be as cool as possible when you do it . 
  with dst a 6 o'clock run is * actually * 5 o'clock , so you 're essentially stuck running an hour earlier than you otherwise would be . 
  no thanks . 
  heart attacks , traffic accidents , suicides , and lower worker/economic productivity . 
  it also makes inter-state and international communication more complicated than necessary , which is a pain for both businesses and individuals . 
  and for all this , it has literally no real benefits . 
  yes , but that carries the very obvious implication thay daylight saving is a good idea . 
  just because they do n't explicitly say that in as many words does n't mean that 's not what they 're expecting readers to take away from it . 
  southern state arrogance , please . 
  queenslanders are smart enough to say no to that shit , and south australians are not . 
  something , something , three logicians walk into a bar , something something . 
  oh , thanks for that . 
  very interesting . 
  got ta be honest , i can barely hear the difference even then . 
  the more open vowel is way more noticeable to my ear than the rhoticity ( side note : [ `` rhotacism '' means something different to rhoticity , which is the property of a rhotic consonant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhoticism ) ) , although listening side-by-side , both are noticeable . 
  but unlike , say , the pronunciation of `` waterr '' vs. `` watah '' , i do n't think i 'd ever notice the difference in average speech . 
  indeed . 
  they say it 's when the ratings come in for the second episode that you can truly start declaring a show an early success/failure . 
  and of course , even then , a show can improve or lose ratings faster than normal . 
  assuming you guys are talking about the american office , the opening minutes of the show turned me off entirely . 
  a shot for shot remake of an incredible masterpiece of british comedy ? 
  no thanks . 
  money is n't the only concern . 
  they have * different * functionality , but not necessarily one is clearly * better * than the other . 
  take a look at videos of both in action . 
  try a free trial , if either/both has/have them available . 
  see which one has a workflow that gels for you . 
  i would highly recommend matt colville 's video about fantasy grounds as a place to start looking at that . 
  the application bundle architecture is one of the most genius , but understated , design features of macos . 
  there 's also the comedy one , and pirates of silicon valley . 
   divine magic alone makes this a very powerful archetype since it deals with the sorcerer 's main weakness, 
  while i agree with / u/magicmanfk that the * main * weakness of the sorcerer is the lack of spells they are allowed , i also agree that allowing sorcerers access to the * entire * cleric spell list is a bit much . 
  personally i would have preferred it to be like the last draft , but instead of just giving them the spells of a particular domain , they gave the sorcerer * access * to those spells if they want to choose them . 
  oh good , i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who made that mistake ... 
  check out / r/unearthedarcana and sort by the adventure flair .
