  i 've always thought the american names were rather strange . 
  an eighth note ? 
  an eighth of what ? 
  a bar ? 
  only if you 're in 4/4 . 
  most of the time i 've found a sextuplet sounds better when thought of as two groups of three ( if they 're semiquaver sextuplets , remember that three of the semiquavers will take as much time as one normal quaver ) , but i suspect you 're right that * sometimes * a sextuplet could be grouped the other way , while triplets never could . 
   light + darkvision = blindness combo ? 
  is that a thing in pathfinder ? 
  wtf . 
  i was getting a 3 later than this time in my first year , but eventually worked my way up to a 5 . 
  though in my case , it was only after i realised this that i started tutoring . 
  how much study are you doing for maths ? 
  because it really will need to be a couple of hours every night . 
  it 's not easy . 
  and trust me when i say that if you 're going into engineering , you 'll need it . 
  frankly , if , even after working really hard at it , you ca n't pass hl maths , you 're probably not going to be able to do engineering at a university level . 
  that shit is * tough * . 
  my university , and probably some others , offers a first year course which is the equivalent of maths hl , for people who did n't do it before entering . 
  but they also do list maths hl ( or equivalent ) as a requirement for entry . 
  but the thing is , you really would be better off going in with that knowledge . 
  a six month course trying to jam in all the knowledge you need is going to be tougher than having two years in a high school environment . 
  no shit . 
  thanks . 
  and who decided a `` whole note '' was to be what it is ? 
  my not call the minum a whole note , and the semi-breve a double note ? 
  or a crotchet a whole note . 
  it is , after all , usually one whole beat . 
  yeah that sounds pretty bizarre to me . 
  if their darkvision is that poorly able to adapt , surely they would be penalised even in normal sunlight . 
  i can understand something like that for the seriously dark-oriented races like drop and duergar , but for races that are out in the daylight as much as they are underground it seems like an unnecessary and poorly thought out penalty . 
  if you want some serious nova , you can combine smite spells with divine smite into one attack . 
  you have to declare the spell beforehand , and then you can choose to use ds upon hitting . 
  the issue is n't that it 's a `` paper aeroplane '' , it 's that it 's very specifically the exact same paper aeroplane that sparrow used , except coloured differently . 
  same rotation , same silhouette , even the same folds . 
  [ seen here , best viewed in res . 
  not that it 's really a * huge * issue . 
  sparrow is no longer in business , and i ca n't actually find that image anywhere on your page . 
  not sure why reddit chose it as the thumbnail . 
  i just thought it was a strange curiosity . 
  well , yes and no . 
  you 're right that ** no ** * one * weather event , even as extreme as this , can be attributed directly to climate change . 
  however , it 's also pretty obvious to anyone with the perceptive talents of a toddler that this type of event is more * common * now than it was , say , 15 years ago . 
  and because of this , it 's not * totally * unreasonable to say that we might not be experiencing this weather event if climate change were n't occurring . 
  moppsy is n't the one trying to make other people feel bad about themselves , or preaching their opinion as though everyone should feel the same way about it . 
  the word `` its '' is already possessive ; you do n't need to add an apostrophe . 
  the problem with that suggestion is that this bot is * most * useful in response to individuals to * do n't * want it . 
  if someone is writing is 18th century units , the bot converts it to a more modern format , but the person who 's stuck in the 18th century does n't * want * to be corrected . 
  so the bot gets downvoted , and its utility is lost . 
  that 's a terrible idea and completely defeats the purpose of the thing ... 
  also , it should n't be showing up when standard units are mentioned , only when imperial or us units are . 
  after all , its entire point is to convert from imperial/us to si . 
  that 's pretty lame of you . 
  the bot is incredibly useful , considering the vast majority of the world has moved beyond 18th century measuring systems . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  both the fact that he was black and the fact that he owned a gym seem irrelevant and unnecessary to me . 
  probably also the fact that he 's in atlanta was n't necessary , except insofar as it implies he 's living a long way away from where you are . 
   seriously though , what is n't min-maxing in your mind ? 
  roll a die every turn . 
  have a table corresponding to every option available . 
  do whatever the die says . 
  or at least , that 's what i assume it is . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` spell '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  the mummy dude 's rags no longer work ? 
  thank the gods . 
  he was such a stupid character to introduce into this show . 
  i love these !, 
  really cool ideas . 
  some of them seem a little weak or situational , but that 's definitely better than them being too strong in my opinion . 
  in fact , i would say that the variant options probably * should * be weaker than the official ones , since you 're basically trading off raw power for versatility . 
  plus , anything that makes * true strike * and * blade ward * remotely viable options is a win to me . 
   read plenty of classes on the wiki, 
  on which wiki ? 
  really best to stay away from there . 
  the homebrew stuff on that site is infamously terrible . 
  people make stuff and throw it up there without giving any care for balance , and because of the format , it 's less likely that people will give ( or that creators will respond to ) constructive criticism . 
  so bad stuff stays bad , and good creators who * want * criticism tend to stay away . 
  it 's an annoying thing that the mods of this subreddit do with the css . 
  they change bold text ( surrounded with two asterisks ) to normal weight , but coloured red . 
  yeah i know . 
  the joke was that , since they seem to consider even the slightest amount of strategic thinking to be `` min/maxing '' , the only way to satisfy them and not be min/maxing was to randomly choose all your actions . 
  actually australia 's greens are arguably one of the most sensible parties out there . 
  with the exception of their stance on gmos , they pretty much always try for an evidence-based solution to problems . 
  they 're also the main party standing up for civil liberties , especially as they relate to technology and the internet , being against things like internet filters and metadata retention laws . 
  they 're essentially our third major party , albeit by quite a wide margin , and with that comes a degree of moderation not seen in the completely marginal greens parties of places like america or the uk . 
  wow , so apparently a lot of people really hate rainer ? 
  i think he 's great . 
  andy was better , and i do hope that rainer is n't going to be `` end game '' , but as a temporary distraction , he 's great . 
  and way better than dylan . 
  dylan was fucking awful . 
  man i really love the timbre of that . 
  it works really nicely for the part . 
  shame the intonation is pretty bad . 
  you just made me snort . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  seriously , that thumbnail is brilliant . 
  speak for yourself , mate . 
  it 's been huge ( yooj ? ), 
  news in australia the last week or so , and really just from a general interest perspective , on would have to be * incredibly * out of touch to not realise how significant the whole thing is . 
  as a side note , just as i was typing this , someone sent me a link to [ this picture , entitled `` map of countries trump has rankled in his first two weeks ] ( http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/156937808170 ) . 
  it certainly goes to show that there are a ** lot ** of people outside the us who do * give a fuck * about the actions of the most powerful man in the world .
