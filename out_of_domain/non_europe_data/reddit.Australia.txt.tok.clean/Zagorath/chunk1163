  wow . 
  that looks like it 's being blown * way * out of proportion . 
  i honestly really respect the mods for what they 're doing there . 
  it 's not how i run my subreddit ( i downvote distasteful stuff all the time , but i 've only ever * removed * spam and totally off-topic stuff ) , but i completely respect what the mods are doing . 
  the people getting their knickers in a twist really need to get some fucking perspective on things . 
  and clearer product lines . 
  when he got back to apple , one of the first things he did was cut their computer product line down to portables and desktops , one high end , and one low end of each . 
  right now , they 've got the macbook , the macbook air , the macbook pro with touchbar , and the macbook pro without it , and it 's not entirely clear exactly how they 're meant to be placed in comparison to one another . 
  it seems to me that things started going in the wrong direction when they had a 13 inch with retina and a 15 inch without retina at the same time . 
  they eventually cut one of those ( imo the * wrong * one ) and made the product line clearer again , but they 've gone back to a state of cloudiness very similar to that of the mid '90s , if not quite that bad . 
  as i learnt very recently , during a conversation about `` what 's the most well-known monty python sketch '' , four yorkshiremen actually * is n't * a python sketch . 
  it has john cleese and graham chapman , but was n't a part of python , and lacked idle and palin . 
  i thought four yorkshiremen was a clear winner for that conversation , so was disappointed when i found out it did n't even qualify . 
  what ? 
  taiwan has n't been officially recognised by any western country ( unless you count the holy see ) since the 1970s . 
  edit : not that i think that 's how it should be . 
  being more open about recognising taiwan is one of the only positive things trump has done since his election , in my opinion . 
  well , yes , that did seem to be the consensus . 
  i would have strongly argued that four yorkshiremen is more famous , had to been python , though . 
  you do realise you just replied to a comment acknowledging that fact , right ? 
  yup . 
  pure carbon dioxide gas has a density of about 2 & nbsp ; kg/m ^ ( 3 ) . 
  diamonds have a density of over 3500 . 
  so to make a diamond , * even from pure co_2 * , would need 1500 times the volume of air of the diamond you intend to create . 
  or , for a 1 & nbsp ; cm ^ ( 3 ) diamond , 1.5 & nbsp ; l. 
  adjust for a 400 ppm occurence of co_2 in the air , and you 'll need about 3700 & nbsp ; l for one tiny diamond . 
  and even then it 'll need to be cut , because crude diamonds are n't worth much . 
  these are all back of the envelope calculations and i 've probably made mistakes somewhere , but they go to show how infeasible this is . 
  edit : actually , now that i think about it , if the above calculations are correct , this is * very * feasible . 
  i do n't know the spell in question or its range , but 3700 & nbsp ; l is not all that big . 
  a standard 25 & nbsp ; m school swimming pool has a volume of nearly 10 times that , [ according to this page ] ( http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2005/jeffreygilbert.shtml ) . 
  edit again : wait , just realised i never accounted for the fact that carbon dioxide also includes the dioxide . 
  ca n't be arsed to do any more calculations though . 
  also a ua for modern armour . 
  plus the modern weapons in the dmg . 
  it was in previous editions , but for some reason wizards of the coast has renamed it this time around . 
  this * is * the new psion class . 
  i think they 're combining psion , as well as some other psionic-based classes , into a single class with different subclasses this time around . 
  but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  hey , reddit 's formatting requires that you put a blank line in between paragraphs . 
  otherwise they appear as a single long run-on block of text . 
  that 's rather interesting . 
  have you tried submitting it to / r/unearthedarcana to get proper feedback on it ? 
  which refresh on short rests , and which are at the highest level . 
  that means that , in a standard adventuring day , at level 7 , a warlock can cast six 4th level spells . 
  everyone else can cast * one * . 
  definitely more interested in pacts and invocations . 
  so far , there has n't been a * single * patron outside of the player 's handbook that interests me in the slightest ( except for one or two homebrew ones ) , so i do n't have a lot of faith in the idea that more patrons is worthwhile . 
  but i agree , we 'll * probably * just see some patrons . 
  maybe a pact or two , but no invocations .

  oooh , these are great !, 
  might just use some of them myself . 
  they also have their kryptonite , but unlike superman , theirs is extremely readily available . 
  green martians could n't put that to use against them , since they have the same weakness . 
  in `` choke '' , you 've mentioned something called `` special exhaustion '' . 
  presumably this is meant to be temporary exhaustion ? 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5r0l58/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5r0l58/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  this one is useful not so much to change what actually * happens * , as it is to just * prove * bill morrow 's recent statements are as ludicrously wrong as we all know they are . 
  that makes it much more interesting than the typical change.org petition , in that it has a very high chance of succeeding on its goal . 
  all it truly needs to succeed is to get a lot of signatures , whereas * most * need to effect change to be considered successful . 
  i think the fact that they come with benefits * and penalties * is what makes all of these , except the teleporting one , so incredibly interesting . 
  that last one especially is brilliant for this . 
  this is n't super uncommon . 
  in australia 's recent history , we had prime ministers kevin rudd , who was much loved by the public , but absolutely * despised * by the other parliamentarians who had to work with him , and julia gillard , who was not popular with the public , but was extremely popular amongst her party . 
  edit : i do n't think it 's entirely a coincidence that the women in both of these cases are unpopular with the public while popular with those who know them , but nor do i think that is the sole factor at play . 
  the real one was banned ? 
  i could have sworn i saw a v_maet comment just a day or two ago . 
  so , what 's the question ? 
  what do you need help with ? 
  you should note that your map appears to be pre-spellplague ( i.e. , really , * really * out of date -- the spellplague happened in 1385 & nbsp ; dr. current d&d takes place in around 1487 & nbsp ; dr. ) . 
  unther , in eastern faer\u00fbn , is no longer in existence . 
  it has been replaced by tymanther , the home of the dragonborn . 
  there have probably been other changes in that 100 year span . 
   he would be taking on another famous ` persona ' at some point, 
  were those his exact words ? 
  because `` taking on '' can mean either `` adopting '' or `` fighting '' . 
  they do have a search feature , though ? 
  it 's under the discover tab . 
  21 days ? 
  i just wish i knew whether the `` you have listened for '' stat was the amount of time actually spent listening , or the amount of content listened to . 
  when you 're listening at speeds  2x , those numbers become * substantially * different . 
  i 'm guessing it 's the former , which would mean i 've listened to 71 days of content since march 2015 . 
  i think it 's quite a clever mechanic . 
  currently you 're only using it for choking , correct ? 
  i 'd be hesitant to expand that to other options , but as it is right now it 's great . 
  the first atomic detonation actually did n't happen until july 1945 . 
  it 's really quite astonishing how the whole thing came together as quickly as it did .
