  getting little boy and fat man out required them to work as quickly as they possibly could ; there were no nuclear weapons stockpiles until after the war . 
  mainly writing this for general interest purposes , and to correct one very , ** very ** minor detail of your comment . 
  your point is still valid . 
  oh , that would make sense , i suppose . 
  but he did specifically say * podcasts * , rather than episodes , so i just assumed he meant what the comment said . 
   sometimes , it 's the least you can do !, 
   not really [ here are ways you could do way more ] . 
  you see the ridiculousness of this statement , i assume ? 
  the first successful atomic bomb * test * was in july 1945 . 
  then little boy and fat man were used to end the war in august . 
  is that assuming a radius of 1 au ? 
  because the dylan sphere in * relics * seemed a good deal smaller than that , to me . 
  though it 's arguable that 's just because trek never visually portrays distances well . 
  also i assume you meant 2.8 \\* 10 ^ ( 17 ) & nbsp ; km ^ ( 2 ) ? 
  the implied words are `` as a '' , actually . 
  surely the mathematician in you should hate this option even more ? 
  it takes the average from about half the maximum to about three quarters of it , buffing everyone hugely . 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  but yes , firefox ignores some of the syntax needed by homebrewery . 
  you will need to use chrome . 
  it 's a much , much better browser over all anyway . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you may want to try asking in the arcana forge megathread . 
  as a general rule though , the only real way to make something from 5e available in pathfinder is to take the same themes of it and build it mechanically from scratch . 
  they are two completely different games , and content is ** not ** cross-compatible . 
   the sad part is it 's my first language, 
  well , to be fair , if you 're not esl , chances are you do n't see the word esl very often . 
  so it 's an understandable mistake . 
   music that was clearly spat out of finale with no second thoughts, 
  could be worse . 
  could be musescore . 
  that damn thing produces such fucking ugly music i do n't understand how people can possibly use it . 
  but indeed , this is one reason i love sibelius . 
  the magnetic layout features mean even with no effort whatsoever , the engraving is passable . 
  you have to work hard to make a bad score with it . 
  i believe dorico is much the same , though i have n't had the chance to use it myself yet .

  so platypodes are the same as octopodes , in this sense ? 
  you 're confusing being a douche to someone because you think you can get away with it , with being a douche specifically because the person is a woman . 
  both are shitty , but they 're not the same . 
  a better analogy would have been if you were a 160 & nbsp ; cm scrawny dude . 
  the first amendment also grants technology companies the right to adjust their algorithms to decrease the prevalence of misinformation , if they so desire . 
  that 's what tim cook is suggesting they do . 
  in terms of formatting , it would look a lot nicer if you had the image stretch from one edge of the page to the other , \\* and added tears and stains to the edge . 
  it 's really easy to do in photoshop with the brushes in [ our subreddit 's homebrew resources ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3uwxx9/resources _ open_to_the_community / ) . 
  the thing is , because if facebook 's size and ubiquity , most people probably have people as `` friends '' whose political opinions they disagree with . 
  the `` racist uncle '' stereotype , for example . 
  facebook could show you everything all your `` friends '' post in reverse chronological order , like twitter does . 
  it would undoubtedly be the simplest method . 
  but if people were being inundated with their racist uncle 's bullshit opinions all the time , they 'd associate facebook with that and get sick of the platform . 
  so it 's in facebook 's interest to figure out what makes people angry and not show them that . 
  i would suggest just stating that a shuriken ( side note : you repeatedly spelt it incorrectly throughout this document ) is a reskinned dart , and the katana a reskinned * longsword * . 
  currently , your shurikens are basically a slightly nerfed version of the shuriken , and your katana is a nerfed scimitar . 
  katana as scimitar does n't make a lot of sense . 
  both in reality and in common fiction , they are not a weapon that was dual-wielded . 
  they * were * a fairly large weapon that would normally be wielded two handed , but which could also be used in one hand . 
  if you do want it to resemble the scimitar in its mechanics , perhaps the [ wakizashi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wakizashi ) would be a more appropriate japanese name ? 
  or even better , the [ ninjat\u014d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ninjat\u014d ) is the weapon most associated with ninjas , and makes a lot of sense being dual-wielded . 
  and shuriken as darts is a no-brainer , really . 
  in general , it 's best to avoid making anything homebrew if you can . 
  when you 've got weapons that are so perfectly described by existing mechanics with slightly different flavour , there 's really no good reason * not * to do that . 
  you 'll also need to specify that the ninjat\u014d and shuriken are counted as monk weapons . 
  ( though i 'd be wary about doing that if you do keep the katana , and make it the equivalent of a longsword , since no monk weapon currently can do 1d8 . ), 
  if they 're not monk weapons , they become very poor options very quickly . 
  simply being proficient with them is n't really enough . 
  a lot of these list `` prerequisites '' that do n't really make sense . 
  disciple of devils , fiendish lust , scion of sorrow , etc. 
  these should probably be explained somewhere . 
  you also need to double check your level maths . 
  disciple of asmodeus requires you be level 14 before taking it , but has rules for up to 8 levels . 
  it 's impossible to take more than 7 levels before you reach the level cap . 
  graz ` zt has the same problem , and thrall of pale night ca n't actually take more than 4 levels , but has 8 spelt out , etc. 
  it would also help ** a lot ** if you could spend a little time on the formatting . 
  it 's really , really difficult to read this as it is , compared to something produced through the homebrewery . 
   i increased the damage of the katana to 1d8, 
  no existing monk weapon can do 1d8 damage , and it does n't make any sense for this to be different , since it should be similar to the scimitar . 
  just put a little sidebar saying ninjato uses the scimitar stats , and shuriken uses the dart stats . 
  no need to write the specific stats out yourself . 
   what are you talking about two handed ? 
  i never gave it that property, 
  you did n't , but i was describing the katana as i believe it would best be statted : as a longsword . 
  a 1d8 weapon in one hand , or 1d10 weapon in two hands . 
   i am kind of confused by what you said about `` make it the equivalent of a longsword '' was this a typo ? 
  no , it was my response to * if * you decided to disregard my advice to change katana to ninjato , * and * my advice that if you keep the katana but stat it similarly to the scimitar , like you did in the original document . 
  since you 've changed the name to ninjato , you can freely ignore that bit . 
  perhaps i was a little unclear in my previous comment , since i was trying to explain what i think you should do , but also what i would suggest you do if you ignore previous recommendations , which got fairly convoluted . 
  to summarise my actual recommendations :, 
  * make shuriken and ninjato monk weapons . 
  * say `` shuriken = dart '' and `` ninjato = scimitar '' in a sidebar, 
  everything else i said was basically just hedging my bets or explaining my reasoning , and if you do that , you can ignore the rest . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  ah , right . 
  well , i 'd be rather hesitant to put feats as a prerequisite to a prestige class , personally . 
  it goes against the design philosophy of 5e pretty heavily , and brings things back to the god-awful kluge that was 3 . x. 
  that said , if you do leave them in , i would write the prerequisite bullet point as `` the ______ feat '' , to make it totally clear what 's going on . 
  i do indeed mean base damage . 
  i saw two or three over the past month , all of which were filtered by the spam filter before i got to them .
