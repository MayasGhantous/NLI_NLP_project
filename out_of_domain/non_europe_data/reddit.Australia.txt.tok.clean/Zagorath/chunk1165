  just in the last hour , i 've seen two that were uncaught by the spam filter . 
  there certainly does seem to be a sense that they 're picking up pace based on comments on / r/spam , too . 
  that looks lovely . 
  psst , you forgot a flair !, 
  i 've added it for you this time , but we ca n't be playing favourites too much :p, 
  is n't quenya the more complete language ? 
  on an unrelated note , i do think it 's a little bit of a shame that klingon gets the most attention of the artistic conlangs . 
  sure , it might have a more complete vocabulary , but it 's so much harder for the average english speaker to pronounce correctly than quenya or sindarin . 
  plus tengwar is such a pretty looking script ... 
  in universe , sindarin was the one you 're more likely to encounter in middle-earth . 
  quenya was kind if the equivalent of latin in medieval italy , to sindarin 's medieval italian . 
  used for high art and formality and such . 
  but most conlang conversations i 've seen seemed to suggest quenya was the better language to learn , with more resources available , and the one for which tolkien had more compete notes . 
  i ca n't attest to it personally . 
  i 've never gone much further than to try and learn to read tengwar . 
  and i never even properly finished that . 
  tiger is a popular option in south east asia . 
  wait , he mentioned that ? 
  i must have missed that moment . 
  and i guess i now know one of the other players at my table watches matt 's videos . 
  because we had a one shot just like that right after i got a copy of volo 's . 
  the first half of it was demonstrating regular goblin life . 
  it was the night of some big feast and there was celebration and games ( wherein people tested their strength and stealth and what have you -- so as to actually get some gameplay in ) . 
  then , the tribe leader announced that he had located some treasure and wanted some goblins to go retrieve it . 
  so we did , and fought some wild creatures along the way to get it . 
  we eventually get there , where we find a party of human adventurers . 
  the dm 's intent , you see , was for us to die as the random no named fodder adventurers kill hundreds of in their lifetime without thought . 
  a clever reversal of tropes to make you think . 
  unfortunately , players being players , we managed to cause an explosion using a bomb or some gunpowder that was at the scene , or something ( truth be told i do n't remember exactly how it happened ) , killing one of the adventurers . 
  the others picked up their dead body and carried him home through a portal , and we returned to our camp heroes . 
  well , those of us who survived . 
  my character did n't , and there were other deaths there too . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use [ the arcana forge thread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5r0l58/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in [ the arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5r0l58/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  good stories certainly do generate discussions on dndgreentext . 
  so do controversial ones . 
  there are 5 posts with over 20 comments on the front page right now . 
  and many , * many * of the posts in the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) gained significant traction . 
  i find it noteworthy that this bill essentially states that people who would rather not be a republic at all should therefore get no say in the type of republic we become , if we do become one . 
  that seems rather undemocratic to me . 
  would it not be better to do something similar to the new zealand flag referendum ? 
  allow a vote for the type of republic first ( preferably using instant-runoff ) , and then have that go head to head with the current system in a separate election . 
  for something as important as this ( as opposed to the relative triviality of changing a flag ) , it seems like things should be done with the utmost rigour . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` spell '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as this is your second warning , in the future failure to flair your posts may result in their removal . 
  reddit 's formatting requires that you add a blank space in between each paragraph . 
  otherwise they display as a single big block of text .

  so it 's a family purely based on history , rather than being a class of writing systems based purely on their properties ? 
  but in relation to your comments on popular usage , i 'm not sure it is all about mysteriousness . 
  without being too specific , i 'd say they have to be alphabetic , with relatively simple discrete shapes , e.g. 
  capable of being carved with ease . 
  norse runes and tolkien 's cirth both fit that description . 
  anyway , thanks for the help . 
  yup . 
  i used the spell exactly once with my warlock ; in the first session . 
  promptly got knocked unconscious . 
  i swapped it out for something else the moment i levelled up . 
  if it were 60 or 90 feet , it might have been worthwhile . 
  or even 30 feet for the initial casting , but up to 90 before it 'll break away , it would allow you to get up close before using it , and then get back to safety afterwards . 
   pretty strong for a sorcerer too , since they can quicken spells to use on their bonus action and still deal the automatic 1d12 lightning damage, 
  unfortunately , they can only quicken the initial casting of the spell , raw . 
  they still have to spend an action to deal the extra damage each turn . 
  as of the time of this comment , it actually * does * seem to have subsided . 
  i checked two pages , and did n't see any spam . 
  most of it seemed to be porn -- shared on actual porn subreddits . 
  if you prepare a spell , then you have that spell prepared and can cast it at any time that you have a spell slot of the appropriate size remaining . 
  tell that to the ancient egyptians . 
  anyone know what martial art they 're doing ? 
  is it taekwondo ? 
   swashbuckler rouge, 
  well , he certainly is [ * rouge * ] ( https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1150&amp;bih=652&amp;q=rouge&amp;btng=search+images&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=deniz+akdeniz&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g3g-m1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=11669l11669l0l11929l1l1l0l0l0l0l118l118l0.1l1l0&amp;gws_rd=ssl ) . 
  ah yes , i see what you mean . 
  that 's quite clever . 
   unless their body temperature is colder than ambient, 
  well , dogs apparently have [ a typical body temperature of about 39 & nbsp ; \u00b0 c ] ( http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/what-is-a-dogs-normal-body-temperature/ ) . 
  so , when the weather outside is in the mid 40s , yes , their body temperature * is * colder than ambient . 
  hear , hear . 
  that post was ridiculous . 
  it took me a moment to realise you meant that * you 're * barefoot , and not the dog . 
  which got me thinking . 
  little doggy boots !, 
  for going for walks even if the pavement is too hot for bare feet . 
  riding 3 abreast is n't legal , but the rest of it is . 
  have you made sure google 's location settings are on ? 
  and are you sure that you 've never lied on a response ? 
  have you made sure google 's location settings are on ? 
  for example , if you go to [ this page ] ( https://www.google.com.vn/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.google.com/maps/timeline&amp;ved=0ahukewiv9iaur4rsahvfjzqkhrdhcu0qfggfmae&amp;usg=afqjcng2o4v1kt0ehmwmjtajd6kl1pikag&amp;sig2=0vzoxzj3jhy-o1kajv0mdg ) , do you see useful data ? 
  please . 
  google is n't going to sell their database to anyone . 
  it 's incredibly valuable to them if it 's exclusive , and valuable to their reputation that they keep users safe . 
  all they do is let advertisers show their ads to people who fit a particular demographic . 
  nah , i really do n't understand the hate they get myself . 
  the price is n't great , but i 've found the service is fantastic . 
  the people who implemented the oyster system originally set up their back end in a more expandable way than the translink system .
