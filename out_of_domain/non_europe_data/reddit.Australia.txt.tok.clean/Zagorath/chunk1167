  good point . 
  i have contributed me idea . 
  * leave it the fuck alone . 
  a license plate is the worst possible idea . 
  where in the hells are we meant to mount that ? 
  a simple tattoo type thing is n't a terrible idea , but i mainly just do n't see the * benefit * that could be had from it . 
  the theft recovery thing is pretty interesting , but i 'd that 's the only thing gained i do n't think making it mandatory is a good idea . 
  mine does n't do what the `` steps to reproduce '' says . 
  the trusted voice thing stays switched on . 
  mine just occasionally pops up a message when i say `` ok google '' while the screen is off that it 's unabke to verify my voice , please unlock the thing first . 
  my fingerprint scanner also sometimes ( but not usually at the same time as the above ) fails . 
  when i scan it , it pops up a message saying that for extra security they want my pin . 
  and it 's not just when the device is restarted . 
  do you hate yourself ? 
  rip dothehustle , you will be missed . 
  however , this is the n ^ th ( i dunno specific number ) death of a parliamentarian we 've had in under a year !, 
  i demand an inquiry into the safety of parliament house !, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  did you browse that website using safari ? 
  sorry , but this post is being removed due to not including a flair . 
  if you add an appropriate flair to it , reply to this comment and it may be reinstated . 
  you 've got some weird layout here . 
  the title of `` one with existence itself '' is appearing at the bottom of the first column , while the text for it is in the second column . 
  you can force things onto the second column by using the `` column break '' syntax . 
  it 's the first item in the `` editor '' menu , or alternatively copy and paste the following :, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  with a title of `` drunk guy steals airplane '' , i do n't think this was unexpected at all ... 
  post truth is the idea that people just do n't seem to even care about the lying . 
  the fact that someone who has been blatantly caught out telling outright lies ( as opposed to exaggerations , cases where they can excuse it as a change of circumstances , etc. ), 
  can still get elected , even when their opponent is no where near as bad . 
  that 's what people mean when they say we 're in a post-truth age . 
   you will have data overall throttled at peak congestion once you pass 22gb . 
  only throttled once you reach ludicrous amounts of data in a month , and even then only throttled during peak times ? 
  that 's sounds like an absolutely wonderful deal !, 
  holy fuck that is expensive . 
  $ 125 for your phone plan ? 
  fuck that noise . 
  yeah i 'm enjoying paying less than $ 20 per month in australia . 
  i get no where near unlimited , but i also ca n't see why i 'd need it . 
  i 'm on wifi most of the day , and the only things i do away from wifi are reddit , maps , and light browsing . 
  are people sitting in a park watching netflix or something ? 
  yes , it is . 
   imho , the stereotypical `` annoying vegan '' is grossly over represented on the internet compared to reality , probably by a factor of 10, 
  not in my experience . 
  the last race i was at had a stretch where a bunch of vegans/vegetarians were demonstrating trying to somehow convince the runners to give up meat . 
  i also have a friend who 's vegetarian , not vegan , but he 's pretty militant about it , taking any opportunity he can to try and get others to join him . 
  when he was at college , he started a large ( and thankfully failed ) campaign trying to force * everyone * to take up meatless mondays by having the college only serve vegetarian meals on that day . 
  a report came out a year or two ago stating that for australia , nuclear energy would now be more expensive than investing into renewables . 
  it 's easy for other countries like the states because they 've already got everything they need , they just need to scale up . 
  but if australia was to start using nuclear energy , we 'd have to start from scratch . 
  that means designing , building , and maintaining power plants , and training up people who can do each of those things ( since we have none today ) . 
  obtaining and refining the raw materials needed to run the plant . 
  figuring out where to store all the waste products . 
  if we had done it 20 + years ago , nuclear would probably have been a good idea . 
  but today , it 'd be cheaper to invest in renewables , because the technology has already come along enough to be more worthwhile .

  i just watched the clip of the coal in parliament on abc 's insiders programme . 
  it seemed from that clip that the speaker told him to get rid of the prop immediately . 
  sounds like pretty fair treatment , to me . 
   superior address bar, 
  lol , what mate ? 
  the address bar is the ** biggest ** reason to use chrome over safari . 
  i 've got chrome set so i just type `` r apple '' and it 'll take me to / r/apple , because of the omnibar 's search functionality . 
  no need to click or find the right option . 
  it just goes there . 
  ( i have `` r '' set up as a keyword for https://reddit.com/r/%s , incidentally . ), 
  if i wanted , i could * also * type `` reddit apple '' , and it displays [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0r8ik1o.png ) . 
  i can click on one to have it take me to that page , if i want . 
  safari 's , on the other hand , is incredibly laggy as well as feature poor , and i often find myself pressing enter to navigate , waiting , and finding that nothing has happened , so i have to select the address bar again and hit enter again . 
  most of your other points , i agree with ( * especially * battery life -- i always switch to safari if i know i 'm going to need to be away from a charger for a long time . 
  and i would * love * to have pip available if possible . ) . 
  a couple i find highly dubious ( the utility of the `` share '' button seems particularly dubious compared to a simple cmd-l , cmd-c , cmd-tab , cmd-v ) . 
  but the one about the address bar is just plain * wrong * . 
  chrome 's omnibar is the best in the business by an enormous margin . 
  hi , your comment was automatically removed for using a link shortener . 
  link shorteners are banned reddit-wide , because they mean users ca n't know what they 're going to see before they click on it . 
  make sure you link * directly * to the material you 're trying to share in the future . 
  but anyway , i 'm not entirely sure what this post is meant to be . 
  are you just sharing your plan for your next session ? 
  that would probably be more appropriate at / r/dnd or / r/dungeonsanddragons . 
  this subreddit is for sharing homebrew material , not stories or session plans . 
  the closest to that we normally allow is properly created adventures or modules , which this does n't seem to be . 
  so i 'm removing this post . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  i 'm on only 86 since i bought it . 
  probably had a couple hundred before that . 
  bannerlord confirmed release date 14/02/2017 !, 
  if you 're asking for that , you clearly do n't understand the most basic purpose of the bot . 
  i 'm curious , what is `` convenient '' ( i assume you use it sarcastically , but in that case it would imply that someone at one time thought it a good idea ) of a nautical mile being ~ 1.85 & nbsp ; km ? 
  could you point to a comment where it was used ? 
  maybe then we could explain precisely what 's going on .
