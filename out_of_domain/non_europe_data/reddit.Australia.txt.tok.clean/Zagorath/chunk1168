  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hi , this post is being removed . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is for sharing and receiving critique on homebrew material . 
  your question would be better addressed to / r/dndnext . 
  thanks . 
  i do n't know which one they linked , but there have been a variety of attempts at lycanthropic prestige classes . 
  it seems like a pretty good idea in theory . 
  after all , [ the prestige class vampire ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/boh5e/comments/49mnbi/vampire_prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone/ ) worked * beautifully * , and this * should * be more or less the same basic approach . 
  * should n't it ? 
  personally though , i 've never been nearly as happy with any of the lycanthrope options that have been presented before as i was with the vampire . 
  here are a couple of the previous ones that i found with a quick search :, 
  that 's an almost dictionary definition of what being passive aggressive is . 
  this has already been submitted . 
  to prevent duplicate threads , i am removing this submission . 
  thanks . 
  i absolutely love the raven queen . 
  it 's the first and so far only patron outside of the player 's handbook that i really like the theme of . 
  and the mechanics are there to back it up really nicely . 
  that raven can be used in some very interesting ways . 
  and there are some * really * interesting invocations in there , too . 
  the new * eldritch blast * - based ones for patron specific options are * really * nice . 
  i really like that they 've now given us license to freely use patrons as a prerequisite . 
  it 's really late and i 'm too tired to go through it more , but from the description , it looks like we 're finally getting the generalist wizard many people have been craving ? 
  awesome !, 
  aww man i would have * loved * if they had done that . 
  anything that puts us one step closer to vrylokas being in 5e is a good thing as far as i 'm concerned . 
   yes but she specifically hates anything about artificially extending life . 
  what was the lifespan of vrylokas , again ? 
  the southern states are sick . 
  sick and wrong . 
  why would they say either , when soft drink is clearly the correct name ? 
  why are so many shows doing weirder than normal things with their schedules this year ? 
  gotham and brooklyn 99 both came back from chrissy for 2 -- 3 episodes , before going on a ludicrously long break . 
  modern family had one late episode before chrissy , came back after it for 2 episodes , and then had a month break before seeming to come back to normal . 
  it 's all just so much * weirder * than normal ... 
  rmit has a campus in vietnam . 
  vietnam is communist . 
  rmit is communist propaganda . 
  checkmate , liberals . 
   what 's the fucking point of arguing about something which by it 's very nature ca n't be proven or disprove, 
  the idea that there * is * a god can not be proven or disproven . 
  but specific religions * can * . 
  any interpretation of the christian bible that is anything other than really heavy metaphor/allegory , for example , is plain factually wrong . 
  young earth creationism being the most obvious egregious example of an easily disproved non-metaphorical interpretation , but the exodus and noah 's arc are a couple of other stories that can ( if taken literally ) very easily be proven false , for example . 
  yeah i honestly love self serve machines . 
  almost never have to wait , can go through without needing to have that awful fake friendly conversation , and can even keep listening to my podcast while going through . 
  i do have * serious * worries about the future of economics though , as it relates to employment . 
  automation is , i worry , going to result in far , * far * more jobs being lost than new jobs can be created in new industries . 
  but there 's no sense trying to halt progress . 
  it just ca n't be done . 
  ask the luddites . 
   in this case its not creating jobs just so people can have them , it 's the opposite , they took them away because they thought they could save a bit of money and speed people through the checkouts quicker, 
  you 're sounding an awful lot like the original luddites here , mate . 
  and quite clearly , they were on the wrong side of history . 
  it 's all so fantastic . 
  one of my absolute favourite video game soundtracks . 
  but my favourite would have to be the music associated with the ice queen . 
  [ broken promise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4axw3ogwwa ) , for example , but most of all [ the music box version of it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa58erg_k00 ) . 
  there 's just something so beautifully tragic about the piece . 
  it so perfectly punctuates what i think is the best-written villain in the game . 
  edit : [ nolune village ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bdfqyvmnmm ) and the [ main title ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gj3qhyqca4 ) are pretty high up there too , just for being the ones that * most * make me think `` yeah , this is dark cloud ! '', 
  no part of the game could ever feel more iconic to me than nolune village itself . 
   as you 've stated ( but for some reason chosen to ignore in your argument ), 
  huh ? 
  it 's op 's first anticipated counterargument , and the rebuttal to it was quite simple . 
  it makes gunslinger strictly better than anything else , since you can be better while the gun works , and then switch to equal to others once it fails . 
   if you ever have to add something to page 2 , i 'll understand your pain when you have to update all toc entries and all page skips . 
  i 've never used it myself , but i 'm pretty sure homebrewery has a way of inserting page numbers by reference , for automatic tables of contents . 
  what other problems do you have with how it handles paging ? 
  calling a pepsi or some off brand cola `` coke '' is like calling all facial tissues kleenex . 
  calling a lemonade ( like sprite ) or orange flavoured soft drink ( like fanta ) `` coke '' is like calling * toilet paper * kleenex . 
  according to the map someone else posted , it 's only really called pop in any significant amounts in the far , * far * west of the state . 
  around yates and wayne counties . 
  and it 's a fairly sharp line . 
  that said , i do n't live in the us , let alone new york , so i ca n't speak to the accuracy of the map . 
  stories about tabletop roleplaying games . 
  especially , but not exclusively , in the `` greentext '' format . 
  check out our [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) to see some of the best examples . 
  circumflex , not umlaut . 
  but yeah , scag has a more complete list of forgotten realms gods than the fairly pared-down list in the phb . 
  i 'm pretty sure the scag does have a complete list of extant gods in the forgotten realms . 
  it gets very , very close , anyway . 
  a lot of the gods that have ever existed ( ones in the `` deity '' category on the fr wiki ) are now dead in canon . 
  that said , i 'm not sure exactly what happened to enlil at the end of the devil you know , but i * believe * he 's still alive and still god , so he would be one example of a god not in the scag who is alive . 
   misfire being a troupe in the inspiration material, 
  do you mean `` trope '' ? 
  anyway , you raise some very , very good counterarguments here . 
  the penultimate and third paragraphs are particularly interesting . 
  there 's something particularly interesting about a gun failing at a dramatic moment . 
  that said , i 'm not sure a simple `` random chance to fail '' is a very good method to achieve that . 
  since you mentioned wild magic , i wonder if the gun failure mechanic could somehow function similar to that . 
  or , not * similar * , per se , but i 'm imagining a mechanic where it 's much more likely to fail in moments the dm decides are dramatic , like they can choose when to have a wild surge happen . 
  i would dispute your last bullet point , however . 
  op had a very good refutation of that idea , and i think that refutation makes it entirely clear that this `` flexibility '' is in fact a manifestation of the mechanic being too powerful . 
  the gun is strictly better than a crossbow , until it fails . 
  at which point the character can stop and fix it before continuing -- resulting in a long-term balance of equal to the crossbow -- or immediately switch to crossbow , making their long-term balance better than the crossbow 's . 
  that 's not tactical options , it 's bad balance . 
  alright , the conversation from here on down is not constructive . 
  i 'm removing it . 
  for what it 's worth , i think the first comment captain left was a very worthwhile one .
