  yes , ab/eb is an incredibly powerful combination and is usually considered expected . 
  but there are some other very interesting other options that can be taken instead if you 're willing to give up that damage . 
  crimson is red ,, 
  violet 's like blue ,, 
  precision should n't matter ,, 
  in this poem to you . 
  i 've never been beaten with either , so i really do n't know for sure which is meant to be the worse in this analogy . 
  the four by two has a lot more mass behind it , so it 's hitting with more energy . 
  but it 's also got a larger surface area , so the pain will be spread out over a wider area . 
  it might also be harder to swing it with the same speed -- not sure . 
  the cane , on the other hand , is lighter , but is gon na really sting since the pain is on a smaller area . 
  i agree with your actual point , by the way . 
  the analogy you used was just funny to me . 
  / r/australia has made me happy with the relative vote counts on your comment and grumble 's . 
  crunchies are the clear superior option . 
  peanut paste is bad on sandwiches , and it 's even worse in knock-off smarties/m & ms. 
  but the new cheddar is * so much better * than the old one !, 
  they did improved chicken flavours ? 
  that must not have lasted long . 
  i was overseas before the flavour switch hit stores in my area , and by the time i got back the only chicken i was seeing was the original . 
  what you 're getting at here is something called the [ etymological fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_fallacy ) . 
  i loved them as a kid . 
  tried them recently-ish and they were god-awful . 
  like stale bread with salt . 
  chocolate what now ? 
  never heard of them . 
  even googling that only turns up chocolate rum ball recipes ... 
  cheezels and twisties are australian ? 
  wtf ?? 
  i could have sworn i 've at least seen twisties here in sea . 
  you call it cutting corners , i call it providing a better customer experience . 
  and yes , they 're asking that the police and courts do their fucking job by catching and prosecuting thieves . 
  people breaking the law should n't be allowed to get away with it just because the company they 're stealing from has self-checkouts . 
  that 's a ludicrous notion . 
  what you 're referring to is called tremolo , and the markings for that are usually much thicker than what op is seeing , and they go at the bottom/top of the stem ( furthest away from the notehead ) , [ like so ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/tremolo_notation.svg ) , not in between two notes of a chord . 
  it can also be placed * between * two notes in the horizontal sense , [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/tremolo_notation_two_notes.svg ) , to indicate rapidly switching between the notes . 
  the latter is relatively common in piano music . 
  a lot of orchestral reductions will use it to simulate long held fortissimo chords . 
  you can see it a few times in [ this liszt arrangement of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 ] ( http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/9/99/imslp01056-beethoven-liszt_symphony-5.pdf ) for piano . 
  for something native to piano , the same effect is used in [ the first movement of beethoven 's path\u00e9tique sonata ] ( http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/ee/imslp243128-pmlp01410-beethoven__ludwig_van-werke_breitkopf_kalmus_band_20_b131_op_13_scan.pdf ) , to spectacular effect . 
  single note/chordal tremolo is rarer in piano music . 
  most often , you 'll find it simply as a shorthand way of representing quavers over and over again . 
  for example , [ schubert 's erlk\u00f6nig ] ( http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/imslp15041-schubertd328_erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf ) . 
  it shows triplet quavers in the first bar , but just has dotted crotchets ( implying that they 're dotted * triplet * crotchets ) with a single tremolo line on them after that . 
  tremolo is what it 's called . 
  it 's pretty common in piano reductions of orchestral music , but it does also occasionally appear in original piano music . 
  [ beethoven 's path\u00e9tique sonata ] ( http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/ee/imslp243128-pmlp01410-beethoven__ludwig_van-werke_breitkopf_kalmus_band_20_b131_op_13_scan.pdf ) and [ schubert 's erlk\u00f6nig ] ( http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/imslp15041-schubertd328_erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf ) , for example . 
  not nearly as common as it is for string and percussion , or even wind , parts , though . 
   honestly i 'm peeved it got any invocations while the undying warlock ( scag patron ) ... got none, 
  yeah , i find it really odd that an officially published option is being ignored while beta material in other ua articles is getting attention . 
  it 's especially painful , imo , because i really , really do n't like either the undying light or seeker . 
  too vague . 
  warlock patrons should be specific entities , not abstract concepts . 
  i did n't see exactly how she was setting it up , but i do n't think they were playing full games . 
  more like deliberately setting up certain scenarios to allow lex to practise . 
  like people drill specific techniques in any sport , or practise scales and arpeggios in music . 
  but maybe she was setting them up into an impossible position , like with pawns in the back row . 
  like i said , i did n't see closely enough . 
  in general i agree . 
  you would n't want an asmodeus patron or a glasya one ( i 've seen someone who tried to make one for each of the archdevils and some other major beings , and they were pretty underwhelming to me ) . 
  but the raven queen * is * a really specific entity with a really strange background . 
  in a way she might seem like an undying , but she does n't really like the creation of intelligent undead ( with the * possible * exception -- depending on how you count it -- of her own creations , the vryloka ) . 
  being this weird sort of entity that stands out from everything else has always kind of struck me as the raven queen 's * thing * . 
  but yeah , leave the abstract stuff to the sorcerers . 
  or paladins even . 
  you ca n't `` make a pact '' with light . 
  incidentally , i 'm not a fan of the hexblade either , for similar reasons ( but not identical -- at least magical swords are tangible ) . 
  i do n't particularly like the idea of a magical talking sword giving power to someone else to use . 
  haha , i 'm the exact opposite . 
  i really hope that she * does * end up being a villain . 
  someone who was really close originally could make an incredibly powerful villain . 
  but i do n't think they will do it . 
  the way she 's being portrayed so far just does n't feel to me like someone who 's being set up for a fall . 
  you 're right , but they 're both forms of tremolo . 
  i explained in a little more detail in [ a different comment ] ( / r/piano/comments / 5tzs25/what _ do_the_dashes_on_the_last_three_notes_of_the / ddqknx1?context = 2 ) , replying to the person you replied to initially . 
  more like 8/10 rather than 5/10 imo . 
   none of the undying invocations would be usable in adventurer 's league unless they reprinted undying as well, 
  if so , that 's a completely bullshit excuse . 
  fuck the adventurer 's league and it 's bullshit restrictions on what you can play . 
  that 's not the normal d&d experience , it 's their artificially weirdly closed off one , and it 's not what they should be considering when making new material , * especially * not ua stuff which those guys ca n't use anyway . 
  but anyway , i do n't see why they could n't reprint the undying as well if they really had to bend over to accommodate adventurer 's league . 
  they 've reprinted material before . 
  the deep gnomes exist in both ee and scag , and there 's a spell that 's in ee and volo 's guide . 
  it 's not even a matter of `` not being super-strict about phb +1 '' . 
  that 's literally not a rule that * exists * anywhere other than the damn adventurer 's league . 
  it 's infuriating to me that they would provide all the rest of us a subpar experience solely to accommodate the ridiculous restrictions they 've decided to create for one particular tiny subgenre of the game . 
  all they need to do is ignore that dumb rule in designing content , and all the problems you described instantly disappear . 
   if i 'm one of the designers for 5e , i do n't want to have to look through all of these things for each and every new option i create :, 
  at the moment , if it 's player-facing content , you 're only having to look at phb , dmg , scag , volo 's , and ee . 
  backgrounds are essentially a non-issue , and magic items are at dm 's discretion regardless , so the adventure books do n't matter . 
  and anyway , so you do n't want to have to look through existing material ? 
  too bad . 
  that 's literally * your job * if you 're designing material for the game . 
  make sure it 's balanced with existing material . 
  you need to be looking at existing material anyway to make sure it 's balanced ( unless they 're deliberately only * balancing * for that phb +1 rule , which would be an enormous error of judgement ) . 
  adding in some * specific * hooks to the previously existing material is n't going to hurt that much i would n't think . 
  the hard part is finding * unexpected * synergies , not balancing expected ones . 
  normal players should n't have the material they 're presented with suffer just to kow-tow to some dumb rule for a tiny minority of gamers who unfortunately ca n't find a home/online game to play in . 
  hmm , i do n't know .
