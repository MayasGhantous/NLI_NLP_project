  how would i tell ? 
  i 'd have assumed the vpn software would be responsible for managing that . 
   we 're a republic though so the states decide the president . 
  you say that as though these are related concepts . 
  they 're not . 
  america is a republic , and the states currently decide the president . 
  but these are two unrelated properties america has . 
  you may as well have said `` our biggest export is machinery and computers , so the states decide the president '' . 
  one does not follow from the other . 
  this one seems surprisingly clever . 
  many of the comments look relevant to the post at hand , but are probably actually using some method to pick phrases from highly upvoted comments on the same post . 
  but it is mate . 
  it 's got a stronger , cheesier flavour . 
  the old one was basically plain biscuit . 
   and has some effect on the content produced for non al games, 
  this is what really pisses me off about it . 
  well , that and the fact that al players are * constantly * bringing it up in online conversations . 
  if they just let the al folks do their thing , while making content primarily for the rest of us , it would n't be a problem . 
  but there 's definitely a sense that they do n't give a fuck about the rest of us compared to their ` special ' child . 
  i do n't really know how to explain it more clearly . 
  i want to use the vpn to route my traffic . 
  openvpn does n't have a mac client that i could find . 
  the programme i 'm using seemed to be recommended on openvpn 's website . 
  my main goal is to use the media server 's internet connection to bypass isp filtering on my computer . 
  the media server will be acting as the openvpn server . 
  if possible , i 'll also want to use the vpn to download files from the server to my computer . 
  but that 's a secondary less important goal . 
  no it 's not . 
   the configuration file ... being incorrect, 
  well , yes . 
  that 's obviously the problem . 
  but is it the server or the client 's file that 's wrong ? 
  and how would i go about fixing it ? 
  currently the configuration files for both are as close to default as possible , with only the few changes made as described in the guide linked in the op , and one change regarding ` redirect-gateway ` , which actually made the problem worse . 
  without the redirect-gateway bit , it seemed as though i could connect to the vpn , but my internet browsing was not going through it . 
  with redirect-gateway , i can still connect to the vpn , but when i do , my client 's internet completely stops working . 
  as for port forwards , i 've currently only forwarded through to udp port 1194 , which is the one the guide said needed forwarding . 
   if you got through that , you probably agree that our constitution needs to change . 
  huh ? 
  what ? 
  that definitely was n't my take away . 
  i just thought i was learning some vaguely interesting stuff . 
   you may have noticed that this detailed summary neglects to mention indigenous people who lived on , worked on , and cared for the land we now know as australia for over 40,000 years before the white men who wrote the constitution had even arrived . 
  well , sure . 
  but it also did n't actually mention white settlers , or more recent asian immigrants . 
  and nor should it . 
  the constitution should n't be recognising * anyone * more than anyone else . 
  that link unfortunately does n't contain sufficient information to actually follow , so i tried the [ second ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxxdpfbxcri ) and [ third ] ( http://www.wikihow.com/enable-ip-routing ) ( using both the second and third methods ) google results instead , but unfortunately , no success . 
  as far as i 'm aware , tunnelbick is a standard openvpn client . 
  it takes the same configuration file as the official openvpn does , for example . 
  i suspect the problem here lies with the windows server . 
  a commenter in [ my / r/openvpn thread ] ( / r/openvpn/comments / 5u2umz/this _ computers_apparent_public_ip_address_was / ) suggests it has to do with the server not routing packets properly , but i ca n't figure out how to check if that 's the problem , and if so how to fix it .

  uhh , just in case you did n't know , within christian mythology , the `` immaculate conception '' was the idea that mary was born without sin , and * not * the idea of mary becoming pregnant with jesus while still being a virgin . 
   she 's effectively being punished because of her dad 's politics, 
  if she is being punished , it 's not just for her dad 's politics , it 's also for being involved with and * supporting * her dad 's politics . 
  it would n't exactly be hard for her to say `` i do not support any of my dad 's hateful policies , and wish to remain independent of him . '', 
  but she 's not . 
  she 's choosing to embrace it .

  your image link does n't seem to work . 
  just comes up with `` your ip or ip range is blocked from accessing 4chan '' , despite that not being the case since every other page works . 
   as an australian , it pains me to recommend this change , but the d&d books use american english , so ` honorless ' would be correct . 
  nah stuff that bullshit . 
  spell the damn word properly . 
   the car road, 
  no , just the road . 
  the one cyclists are legally allowed to ride on , and where car drivers are legally required to pass with at least one metre between the tip of their mirror and the edge of the bike 's handlebar . 
   car-tracks i think they 're called roads, 
  you 're right . 
  they are called roads , and not car-tracks . 
  that 's appropriate , since bikes are just as entitled to ride on them as cars are . 
   the outrage is at cyclists riding like idiots and hitting people in a park in kangaroo point, 
  hitting people who have strayed * onto a bike path * . 
  not to say that cyclists going through at crazy high speeds is okay . 
  the cyclists are absolutely at fault here . 
  but * so are the pedestrians * . 
  because they should not be walking on a bike path . 
  cyclists get a bad rap because of dickheads like you who make sweeping generalisations based on a few bad eggs , and yet for some reason do n't make the same sweeping generalisations about car drivers ( here 's a hint : way more deaths and injuries are caused as a result of bad driving than bad riding ) or pedestrians ( another hint : at least part of the blame in the scenario you described * is the pedestrians ' * -- should n't be walking on a dedicated bike path ) . 
  absolutely , that is a problem that should ideally be fixed . 
  and some mention of that solution is being made . 
  but op 's main point here is to shit on cyclists , make no mistake . 
  as a side note , a better analogy would be if it was an area * not * marked by a zebra crossing , but pedestrians were frequently crossing there anyway ( a [ desire line ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desire_path ) ) . 
  you 'd want the council to do something about that . 
  perhaps a pedestrian overpass , for example . 
  and even if they did n't , they would surely then count as property . 
  so the answer would * still * be yes .

  it must be sad to have absolutely no passions in life . 
  no activity that you really enjoy doing for its own sake , that drives you to try to do the best you can at it . 
  because that 's quite honestly the only explanation i can see for this shitty attitude you 've got .
