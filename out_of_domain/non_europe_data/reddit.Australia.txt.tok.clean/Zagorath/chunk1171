  either you have no passion for anything , so you ca n't understand anyone else having it and assume they must be self-righteous arses , or even worse , you 're jealous of the fact that they have something they enjoy , while you lack that , so you manifest your jealousy as anger . 
  either way , i really do pity you . 
  edit : i guess that , or a total lack of empathetic capability . 
  either way , pretty sad . 
  out of interest , how common are roundabouts in croatia ? 
  i saw a study in australia ( where roundabouts are seen quite commonly ) that showed they were in fact * more safe * than a regular four-way intersection . 
  and i 've anecdotally heard that the same is true in the uk . 
  it 's also a rule on this subreddit that all homebrew must be tagged as such , so any conceptual reasons aside , that 's one reason it would have to be tagged . 
  yeah it is . 
  minor correction , since you keep writing `` gb '' throughout this thread . 
  gb means giga * bits * , and is an entirely different unit to gb , which is giga * bytes * . 
  since you 're talking about amounts of data downloaded through your isp , you almost certainly mean gb . 
  if you were talking about download * speeds * , gb ( or mb/kb , to be more realistic ) would be appropriate . 
  [ so , i found that study i was talking about before ] ( http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/safety/roundabouts/benefits.htm ) . 
  turns out it was n't about australia , but about america . 
  specifically , washington state . 
  ( i misremembered , since the url said `` wa.gov '' , and i was probably thinking of western australia . ), 
  the tl ; dr is that roundabouts reduce * overall collisions * by a little , injuries by a lot , and nearly eliminate fatalities entirely . 
  [ this study , by monash university in australia ] ( http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/216519/muarc007.pdf ) had similar results . 
  [ and this study with data from many countries ] ( http://library.ite.org/pub/e1d0d4c8-2354-d714-5194-e24d1ee803c4 ) had some interesting things to say . 
  it says that in the uk , the way roundabouts are designed causes them to have a much higher rate of accident than roundabouts in other countries . 
  it does still , however , make the point that roundabouts are safer than cross intersections in numerous ways . 
  no croatia , unfortunately , though . 
  mostly just anzuk , central , western , and northern europe . 
  yeah the pic did n't spoil it for me . 
  i thought that was the dad . 
  we do n't learn the narrator is the girl 's mum until half way through the block of text anyway . 
  what spoiled the ending for me was the fact that the name of the user who posted it was `` faith in humanity '' . 
  i personally have n't noticed too much of a stereotype for their personalities either positive or negative . 
  the only thing i can consistently say about skaters is that they never land a trick . 
  whenever i walk past people skating i always watch , and * at best * i see one out of ten attempts succeed . 
  it 's really quite humorous . 
  `` whoever '' , actually . 
  you would say `` he wrote this '' , not `` him wrote this '' . 
  `` he '' is to `` him '' as `` who '' is to `` whom '' . 
   but it 's still considered a shared path, 
  is it ? 
  i do n't know the area particularly well . 
  shared paths are the ones marked [ like this ] ( https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/assets/images/road-rules-bicycle-shared-path-sign.png ) . 
  if the sign looks [ more like this ] ( https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/assets/images/road-rules-bicycle-separated-path-sign.png ) ( as , for example , the bicentennial does ) , then it is * not * a shared path . 
  just because there is n't a physical barrier between them , does n't make it a shared path . 
  as i said , i do n't know for certain which it is there , but the fact that everyone , including you , is referring to it as a `` bike lane '' , indicates to me that it is in fact probably a dedicated * bike lane * . 
  cyclists still have an obligation not to ride recklessly , and probably take most of the blame here . 
  but if a pedestrian is on the bike path , they certainly take a not inconsiderate amount of the blame . 
  even more so if a parent is letting their small child wander so close to it . 
  as for the thing about pedestrians having no way to cross it , that 's irrelevant . 
  pedestrians are already legally allowed to cross bike paths , so long as they do so quickly . 
  would a gif of a rat going through a maze count as `` like us '' ? 
  because really , this is just the same sort of thing as that . 
  it does n't belong here . 
  these already exist . 
  they 're called multireddits . 
  [ and there 's even already a subreddit for sharing multireddits . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/multihub/ ), 
  [ that 's not a roundabout . 
  * this * is a roundabout .

  i loved frostfall when i played with it . 
  but honestly , if it 's your first time , i would say go as light on the mods as possible . 
  i probably would n't ~ ~ okay ~ ~ play with anything other than skyui . 
  interesting npcs is a pretty easy one to swallow , too . 
  i would n't recommend it for a first timer , but if you 're really going to use game-altering mods on your first time , it would be one of the first i 'd add . 
  frostfall alters the game really considerably and i would stay away from it as a first timer if i were you . 
  edit : damn autocorrect . 
  oh i dunno , maybe he does n't want his feed littered up with the absolute lowest quality uninteresting crap like this . 
  there 's also moonlight , appassionata , and hammerklavier . 
  shame he never wrote any others though . 
  should have been, 
   no , ** originally ** anti-gun , but has ** used ** them before . 
  not sure about originally . 
  might be something that means `` extremely '' , but i ca n't think of the word it could be . 
  i thought arrow paced itself really well in seasons 1 and 2 . 
  this season has felt really poor though , imo . 
   there do n't seem to be multiple material planes -- now all of the `` normal '' worlds are just part of the same material plane . 
  there 's no `` prime material '' anymore , looks like, 
  forgotten realms has two main material planes . 
  abeir and toril . 
  toril being the normal world , and abeir being a twisted place forsaken by the gods and where normal magic does n't work . 
  the two planes colliding is what resulted in the spellplague and therefore 4th edition . 
  their sundering was the start of 5th . 
  i ca n't find anything that would suggest these are no longer considered separate planes . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure the word `` plane '' has been used to describe them in ashes of the tyrant and the devil you know , the latter of which is , as far as i 'm aware , the only time abeir has been directly visited . 
   some boys have different gifts . 
   \\* sneaky look at the camera \\*, 
  i did a literal sulu-like `` oh myyy '' at that . 
  wow . 
   high interest loans from international shell corporations that you own, 
  that , or paying enormous licensing fees to use your own ip , since technically that shell corporation owns the ip . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey , i 'm pretty sure that pdf of the boef is n't legal . 
  the book is a properly published one , so i 'm fairly sure linking to a scanned pdf of it is piracy . 
  i 'm removing this submission until you edit out that link . 
  once it 's gone , let me know and i 'll approve the post again . 
  the rivers on ocrolon and thagon are impossible . 
  rivers have to run downhill , which makes it impossible for them to go from one coast to the other . 
  the what now ? 
  every subreddit should have an underscored and not-underscored version , imo . 
  that 's a really cool set of rules . 
  yeah definitely both . 
  blinkers should be on early enough that anyone no matter how close can sufficiently react .
