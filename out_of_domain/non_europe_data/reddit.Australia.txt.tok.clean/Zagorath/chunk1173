  edit : and so , it seems , would [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soft_drink ) . 
  i can find nothing it says there which would imply non-carbonated drinks would be considered soft drinks . 
  indeed , the `` terminology '' section specifically describes the term soft drink as synonymous with `` carbonated beverage '' , `` fizzy drink '' , or `` soda '' . 
  and 3rd and 6th . 
  ha , that 's hilarious . 
  on australia a 3 hour drive would definitely be considered a short one . 
  the same is true here in vietnam , but that 's also because traffic is so bad you do n't actually get very far in three hours ... 
  i can understand disliking l and d . but why c and m ? 
  c for century , m for millennia . 
  ( okay really it stands for the roots of those words , but it 's still pretty simple and related to common modern english terms . ), 
  traffic circles are just a specific subtype of roundabout , according to the [ wikipedia article on roundabouts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundabout#traffic_circles ) . 
  but more importantly , the term `` traffic circle '' literally does not exist in the english language outside of america . 
  wikipedia says it of the united kingdom , but i can also confirm that the term is never used in australia either . 
  the seventh level ability is still too combat focussed , unlike most existing fighter archetypes , which get skill-based abilities at that level . 
  not similar at all , but my favourite tone poem is without a doubt [ sibelius 's finlandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosat6u4e-8 ) . 
  [ scheherazade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lex0yte_0 ) in an amazing piece , but not really a symphonic/tone * poem * . 
  it 's more of a suite with a number of discrete movements . 
  it 's just that it happens to be played attacca . 
  more than 3 , since dc also has their [ animated film universe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dc_animated_movie_universe ) ( not to be confused with the now-defunct [ dcau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dc_animated_universe ) , which was from the '90s and ' 00s , and had such shows as batman the animated series , superman the animated series , and justice league ) , and of course the comic books . 
  and , with young justice having been announced to be coming back , that 's another version of the flash, 
  shoulda known they were lying when they said tieflings are demonic . 
  everyone knows they 're diabolic !, 
  hi , this subreddit is for sharing d&d or roleplaying game-related stories . 
  if you 're looking for a group to play with , try / r/lfg or / r/dnd . 
  this submission is being removed . 
  the credits ( and maybe some other stuff , not sure ) seem to be bleeding on to the third column , and are thus unreadable . 
  i do n't have the time to look at this right now , but i absolutely detest the bard class in 5e . 
  the idea of a bard as a generic magic user is completely dumb in my opinion . 
  inspiration and jack of all trades are cool features , but bards casting * comprehend languages * , * detect thoughts * , or * greater invisibility * is just ridiculous . 
  so i really look forward to looking through this when i get the chance . 
  it sounds from your description like your vision of the bard might be more similar to mine than the phb is . 
  has it got things like charming people , putting them to sleep , etc. ? 
  \u00c0 la everyone 's favourite bard , the pied piper ? 
  just use the ` whois ` command in your terminal . 
  ( assuming you use a not-shit operating system on your computer . ), 
  hells yeah they are !, 
  i do n't mind who narrates it , but i 'd be much more likely to read it if it were an audiobook than otherwise . 
  i do n't own a kindle ( and reading on lcd screens is awful ) , and physical books are obscenely expensive in terms of shipping costs , so if it is n't available locally it 's just not worth it . 
  this is really interesting and well written , and it raises some very good points . 
  but it is not without its faults . 
  your example does n't have a flavour that makes sense to me , and i think that could potentially be a flaw of the mechanics first approach . 
  why would an incorporeal being * not * have some form of damage resistance ? 
  why would the incorporeal being be able to attack others as normal ? 
  why would someone with this ability currently * not * just always stay incorporeal ? 
  does being charmed into moving count as willing ? 
  if not , why not ? 
  also , from a mechanics perspective , this specific ability comes with the problem that it allows you to get through too-thick walls . 
  if it 's 35 feet thick and you dash , you can get 30 feet through it . 
  that puts the nearest free space on the other side of it , do you get shunted there . 
  free extra movement !, 
  instead , it should push you to the nearest safe space back along the path you took . 
  but that 's a problem specifically with the way this example was written , rather than necessarily demonstrating a potential flaw of your design paradigm . 
  ffs people , ** do n't feed the trolls ** . 
  downvote , report ( `` keep comments civil '' is a rule on this subreddit ) , and move on . 
  replying to this comment so it gets seen . 
  the people i 'm really addressing is everyone lower down in the thread . 
  true , but very , very few , and they probably look a little different than the standard tiefling presented in the player 's handbook . 
  these are pretty great . 
  only a minor wording change , i would suggest changing, 
   use your reaction to cast this spell against it instead of making a melee attack . 
  in * arcane lance * to, 
   use your reaction to cast this spell against it instead of making a melee weapon attack . 
  plane shift is homebrew made by people who just happen to work for the sake company that produces d&d . it 's not ua or on the sake level as it . 
  i was . 
  no worries !, 
  if you 're interested , the word for `` linguistic origin '' is etymology . 
  / r/etymology is a cool subreddit . 
  actually , in this case , either `` a ua '' or `` an ua '' could be correct . 
  some people read `` ua '' as `` you eh '' , and some people mentally expand it as `` unearthed arcana '' . 
  which is unfortunate , i think . 
  the post that made it trending was a blatant lie on the part of its poster . 
  they claimed lego was planning on making a d&d set , when it 's just a petition on lego 's website to make that happen . 
  and even with that , it 's highly unlikely , since lego and d&d 's parent company , hasbro , are competitors . 
  i love the fact that one of my favourite subreddits is trending , but i hate that the reason was essentially a lie . 
  infernal tieflings can be red , but are actually more commonly flesh toned , maybe with a more pinkish tone than normal . 
  the tiefling as described in the player 's handbook is entirely infernal . 
  this helps to keep things relatively standardised , making it easier for newcomers to understand . 
  it also fits in with the lore of the forgotten realms , which in 5e is the default setting . 
  long ago , immediately after 3.5 e ended ( there was a 100 year time-skip before 4e -- these events happened near the beginning of the time-skip ) , * all tieflings * were transformed into infernal tieflings , thanks to a ritual that helped the archdevil asmodeus become a god . 
  this is why the vast majority of tieflings are assumed to be infernal . 
  only new bloodlines that started since that time can be abyssal , fey , etc. 
  i 'm not familiar enough with these other types to be able to say anything about what they look like . 
  i know that prior to asmodeus 's apotheosis , tieflings were far more varied in looks , and would often be basically human , but with one or two unusual traits . 
  might be horns , funny colour , cloven hooves for feet , funny eyes , tail , etc. 
  but what specific bloodlines result in which of those traits , i do n't know . 
  to the non-americans in this thread who might be interested , there also exists :, 
  * / r/mhoc ( model house of commons , for the uk ), 
  actually , 8 is quite literally the objective correct answer . 
  not because it 's the * best * ; op did n't ask what 's the * best * . 
  the 8th is the * greatest * though , in the most literal sense of the word . 
  haha , ouch . 
  which did you end up going with ? 
  i was lucky enough with my thesis to have the letter j start most of my initialisms . 
  nice and unambiguous . 
  also helped that mine are generally referred to as `` the j ... '' , rather than `` a '' . 
  still , if it leads to growth in the subreddit , and/or more people taking up the game , that 's probably ultimately a good thing , right ? 
  the british isles includes great britain , ireland , the isle of man , and all the other small islands in the area . 
  ireland does n't like that being said , but it 's true . 
  the only reason the constituent ` nations ' of the uk are considered separate countries is to stroke their egos following devolution . 
  no one would reasonably look at their relationships today and call them a country .
