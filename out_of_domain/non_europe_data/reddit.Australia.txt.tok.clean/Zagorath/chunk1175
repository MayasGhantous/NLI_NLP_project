  since most of the photo is about the sky , tilting up to show only one third of the frame as ground would have looked a lot nicer , i think . 
  alternatively , it might have been nice to see with only one third sky , but to make that look nice would probably also require upping the exposure compensation . 
  edit : zooming/cropping in to make the buildings on the skyline a little more pronounced might also have improved the photo . 
  i 'd try from near the edge of the buildings across to the right edge of the brightest part of the sun 's rays in the second photo , and play around with it from there . 
  the rule of thirds is a pretty good way to make much nicer looking photos without having to have a really good camera , or learn about more complicated composition techniques . 
  basically , you just imagine lines across the photo [ splitting it into thirds ] ( https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-rule-of-thirds-1-1.jpg ) , and you put interesting parts of the photo along those lines , especially at the intersections , instead of in the middle . 
  super simple way to liven up even the simplest snapshots . 
  i hold neither story sacred . 
  i just call it uluru because the people who * do * hold one story sacred , and have for thousands of years call it that . 
  some of the people who really do n't give two shits about it , and have only know of it for under 150 years call it by a different name , and i think that 's absurd . 
  why would you * not * choose to respect one group of people , if it also does n't come at the cost of disrespecting someone else ? 
  people who were n't even born when that name switch happened ( assuming you got the date correct ) will be legally able to drive this year . 
  people who could n't talk yet at the time can now legally drink . 
  people who were too young to remember anything from when ayer 's rock was its official name can even drink if they go on holiday to america . 
  and there is n't much chance of the name switching back . 
  hardly anyone of university age today calls it ayer 's rock . 
  so no , i do n't think it 's `` just a fad '' . 
  it 's a change that 's here to stay , whether you like it or not . 
  yeah , i had no idea it was that shape . 
  i thought it was a little more egg-shaped . 
  you do n't need to be able to play properly to be able to get something accurate enough to pitch it . 
  just stick a reed on it , do n't cover any holes , and blow into it . 
  the note should be a written g . if your tuner hovers around an f , then it 's a b flat clarinet . 
  if it says g , it 's a c clarinet . 
  if it says e , then it 's an a clarinet , etc. 
  could you explain where on the sword coast this is ? 
  i thought i knew the area * fairly * well , and i do n't recognise any of this . 
   his hourly wage would be up to ~ $ 12 / hr, 
  difficult to say . 
  without the dm 's guild , he 'd have to host it himself somehow , including some sort of payment system . 
  that means either extra monetary cost to have someone else or some third party system do that for him , or extra cost in terms of his time to manage the systems himself . 
  then , there 's the fact that the dm 's guild undoubtably makes * some * difference ( however small ) to the number of sales . 
  both in terms of exposure and thanks to people already having accounts set up making them more willing to pay . 
  exactly how much impact all that would have , i do n't know . 
  it would depend on a number of factors . 
  it 's also probably still better to roll it yourself , rather than the dm 's guild . 
  but not by a factor of 2 . 
  huh . 
  this is a stereotype with which i was * not * familiar . 
  is the canadian-bear relationship like the new zealander-sheep ( or welshman-sheep ) relationship , then ? 
  well , i suppose as long as you 're open with yourself about the reasons , that 's better than nothing . 
   unless they took , and understood , a philosophy class, 
  specifically , epistemology , or theory of knowledge/tok . 
  but in this case , i really do n't think that 's as important as a decent understanding of science and the scientific method . 
  tok tries not to make judgements about different ways of knowing being inherently better than others , which can leave some people taking away that faith can be a worthwhile way to make judgements about such things . 
  without a solid scientific grounding to base it off of , epistemology is worthless in making judgements about the safety of medical treatments . 
  other areas of philosophy could be worth it for genuine ethical grounds of objection , but i am not aware of any ethical objections to vaccines . 
  it 's not just us . 
  the characters do it , too . 
  in most cartoons i 've seen ( and presumably comic books , too ) , sidekicks/friends/allies usually call out to the superhero by their superhero name . 
  but most of the live action shows seem to have the friends call out things like `` kara !, 
  '' , `` oliver !, 
  '' , `` barry !, 
  '' , etc. 
  i think at least part of the reason * we * do it is that the * characters * do it . 
  i 'm pretty sure man bags are nearly universally laughed at , not just in australia . 
  i 've most often seen them made fun of on american tv or american-dominated websites . 
  but i do n't think it 's a very serious hate . 
  just light-hearted ribbing , mostly . 
  relevant username . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   player characters who turn into vampires, 
  unless you plan on doing this very briefly , as a curse that they try to get rid of asap , i would highly recommend ignoring the mm instructions for vampires . 
  instead , [ use this prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
  it 's more well balanced and works properly for player characters in a normal campaign . 
  the problem , at least in my opinion , with any race-based system for it ( and even more so for a * subrace * based system ) is that there is a * lot * that defines vampires . 
  if a player is going to be a vampire , they 're going to want it to * feel * like a vampire . 
  that means that a balanced race is going to feel underwhelming , because there 's no way you can get the charming , the raw strength , the shapeshifting , the blood drinking , all the weaknesses , etc. 
  in to a race or subrace , without getting way too cluttered and powerful for a race . 
  i 've seen a bunch of attempts on / r/unearthedarcana to make dhampir races , and i made [ my own conversion of the vampire-like vryloka ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) from 4e 's heroes of shadow , but they get away with being vampire-like without calling themselves * true * vampires , so they can be both mechanically balanced and thematically satisfying . 
  but trying to make something as a race or subrace and call it a full vampire , imo , bound to fail . 
  fuck me that colour is gorgeous . 
  what time was it ? 
   making the prcs short and heaviliy roleplay based makes them just flavorful, 
  yup , fully agree . 
  it 's super important that they have a really heavy theme , and they not outshine existing material in any way . 
  that means no `` archmage '' prestige class or anything similar to it . 
  it ca n't just be `` this other class , but better '' . 
  but smaller 5-level dips are an amazing well of potential content for things that do n't make a lot of sense as a full 20 level class , but do make sense as specialisations that add a lot of roleplay potential and a fair amount of mechanical variety that are undertaken by already experienced adventurers . 
  i actually think the rune scribe was a pretty decent example of something that fits the prestige class design space . 
  i also think something like an alchemist or bomb-maker could fit in here quite well . 
  i might also argue that some of the more recent archetypes released might also be better as prcs . 
  in particular , the arcane archer seems like it might be doable in this way , although we 'd have to see how it was done before knowing for sure how effective it is . 
  and what i consider the best piece of homebrew material made for 5th edition just so happens to be a prestige class , the [ vampire ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) by the_singular_anyone . 
  / u/qalarvalar is correct . 
  we require new submissions to come with new content that can be used . 
  head to the arcana forge megathread to ask for help with an idea . 
  this post is being removed . 
  i mean , we 've already had some uas that went quite heavily into their design rationale . 
  we learnt what they consider important to the designs of each class and their subclasses in modifying classes , and we learnt a fair bit about feat design in their weapon feat ua . 
  both vampires and werewolves/lycanthropy have been designed by the homebrew community as prestige classes in the past . 
  the vampire one is * so * good ( as in well-made , not as in overpowered ) , honestly , i 'd be really worried about wizards doing one themselves , because if there was an official one , i ca n't help but think it would probably * not * be as good , and that would be a real shame . 
  i 'd welcome their attempt at lycanthropy though . 
  there has n't really been a single knock-out success in making lycanthropy yet , despite numerous attempts . 
   channels spells into strikes in a way that is n't like smite, 
  i feel like the smite spells ( not the divine smite class feature ) handle this in a pretty good way . 
  you cast them , and then you have until your next turn to land a hit in order to make use of the spell -- provided you can maintain concentration . 
  not a typo . 
  a mistake . 
  one does n't typo the exact same mistake three times in a single post .
