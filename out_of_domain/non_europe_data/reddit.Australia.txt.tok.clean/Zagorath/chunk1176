  that the brisbane city council is illegitimate because it 's actually a business registered in america . 
  [ here 's the thread with the hilariously bizarre theory ] ( / r/brisbane/comments / 1fl6tq/brisbane _ city_council_is_it_a_corporation / ) . 
  yeah it is , but is n't it just hilarious ? 
  / u/jrad27 's comments in that thread were particularly entertaining . 
  was this episode meant to come out last week ? 
  it 's come out a week * after * valentine 's day , whereas last week it would have been while the holiday was in the zeitgeist . 
  checking their user profile , they seem to have fled the country . 
  so i 'm gon na say no . 
   npcs : not really a monster but thinking about it i have noticed that most of my villains and bad guys i have faced myself and run over my time of dnd had been a variety of simple humanoids, 
  so much this . 
  incidentally , this , plus the fact that even some other iconic * monsters * like orcs and goblins count as `` humanoid '' , is why i think giving the ranger access to `` humanoids '' as a favoured enemy ( especially in the new variant where its damage is increased against them ) , rather than selecting two subtypes of humanoid , is ludicrous . 
  they 're just the ultimate enemy type . 
  so incredibly flexible , interesting , and ubiquitous . 
  cheers mate !, 
  the latest official unearthed arcana article can be found [ here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5vd5d5/unearthed _ arcana_21022017_mass_combat / ) . 
  please keep discussions of it to that thread , and to the relevant threads on / r/dndnext . 
  hey thanks for submitting this , but we 've had a change of rules . 
  from now on , in order to try to keep everything more contained and not have half a dozen threads about the same article , we 're instituting a rule that ua articles all be discussed in a single official thread . 
  you can find that thread [ here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5vd5d5/unearthed _ arcana_21022017_mass_combat / ) . 
  cheers . 
  i know we 're getting to this late , but `` no edition warring '' is our only real rule on this subreddit . 
  this comment has been removed . 
  hear , hear !, 
  as i said last week in a thread started by you , fuck the adventurer 's league and it 's bullshit restrictions on what you can play . 
  that 's not the normal d&d experience , it 's their artificially weirdly closed off one , and it 's not what they should be considering when making new material , especially not ua stuff which those guys ca n't use anyway . 
   i honestly do not care how they restrict al , until it affects what new content wotc will be releasing for everyone to use, 
  that is exactly how i feel . 
  let the al folks run things however the hells they choose . 
  but if that means that officially released content , or even more so * unearthed arcana * content ( which the al is n't even * allowed * to use ) gets affected , then fuck that noise . 
  what this rule will do is make every option outside of the phb much , much weaker than phb material . 
  if phb patrons can choose another book with cool invocations or pacts , then those patrons become much , much better than , for example , the undying patron in the scag , because to play an undying is to forgo any possibility of those better options . 
  and that 's even if they * do n't * have patron-specific invocations . 
  if they * do * , the problem becomes exacerbated . 
  `` earth '' could be meant here in the sense of `` water , earth , fire , air '' , in which case `` lava '' could be considered an object inheriting from both earth and fire , in a sense . 
  of course , that would require a language with multiple inheritance . 
  you mean `` would have '' , or possibly `` would 've '' there , not `` would of '' . 
  you should really take a look at the lazarus browser extension . 
  it sits out of the way 99 % of the time , but that one time that you 've typed a heap of stuff before losing it all in a browser crash , accidental refresh , etc. , it 's an absolute ** life saver ** . 
  my biggest bit of feedback was regarding the nature of the hexblade . 
  essentially , i think it 's a really bad concept . 
  it might work nicely mechanically , but the flavour is just really , * really * lacking in so many ways . 
  i left a comment which paraphrased the below :, 
  my problems with it are that first of all it 's just a weapon that 's supposedly giving you these powers . 
  it does n't make a lot of sense , in my mind , for an intelligent weapon to be able to grant a player character the powers of a warlock . 
  * maybe * at lower levels there could be some justification for it ( though even then , i think it is a poor fit ) , but the weapon granting a player the ability to cast * finger of death * , or make your shadow split away from you . 
  but that 's a little subjective . 
  what 's a lot more just plain problematic about it is the fact that a player who gets their power from a magical weapon is probably going to want to * wield * that weapon . 
  thematically that 's what makes sense . 
  to quote / u/flametitan in the / r/dndnext thread :, 
   my biggest problem with the hexblade is that in some ways what you expect from its patron is not actually what you get . 
  if you draw power from a magic sword , it 's reasonable to assume you 'll either possess the sword or at least find it at some point in the adventure . 
  the actual patron is designed under the assumption that no , you do n't actually get to use the weapon you draw power from , but it 'll give you different weapons to take advantage of . 
  and related to this and to my first point , even if you * do n't * get to wield the weapon , the idea that it 's * possible * for a magic weapon to grant you specific powers even over great distances , seems to me like utter nonsense . 
  i generally prefer my patrons to be extraplanar , because those are the sorts of beings for whom it makes sense to be able to `` grant '' someone else some power . 
  cheers mate !, 
  it 's not grammar nazing ( naziing ? 
  i dunno how you 'd write that -- and yes , i 'm aware of the irony ) , it 's just a friendly reminder of how to write that phrase , since the way it 's often spoken can sound a little ambiguous and it 's an easy mistake to make the first time . 
   ranger revised humanoids are actually already listed as a favourite enemy option , without the need to choose two types , according to raw, 
  yup . 
  that 's the problem . 
  it 's far , far too powerful compared to the other options , and should be changed back to the two subtypes . 
  fundamentally , i think that the otherworldly patron should be * otherworldly * . 
  extraplanar , specifically . 
  i do n't think even the most powerful beings of the material realm should be able to be warlock patrons . 
  the way i conceptualise it , it just does n't make sense for one being to channel power to another being , when both are from the material plane . 
  but even if it did , i feel like a weapon that happens to be able to think is generally still not a great fit . 
  it 's no dragon or lich , for example . 
  it ca n't really do anything on its own , even if it can have thoughts . 
  how could it possibly have the ability to channel the amounts of energy a high level warlock uses ? 
  that 's where the bit about * maybe * low levels it could make sense if you look at it the right way , but still never at high levels . 
   maybe an ancient dragon was imprisoned in the weapon, 
  well , if that were the case , then it should be an ancient dragon patron , because that 's what the pact was with . 
  the fact that it 's currently trapped inside of a weapon is incidental . 
  my last warlock 's patron was a devil trapped inside of a book . 
  that should n't have been a `` tome patron '' , because that 's ludicrous . 
  it 's just a fiend patron . 
  with the tome pact . 
  but i have to stress , i do n't like the idea of a dragon patron * anyway * , because they 're not an otherworldly being . 
  they 're just really really powerful material plane beings . 
   you just are n't being creative at all, 
  fuck off mate . 
  finger of death is from the warlock spell list . 
  any warlock can cast it . 
  i just used it as an example of a high level spell that i do n't think it makes sense for a sword with thoughts to be able to grant . 
  i 'd still feel a lot more comfortable about this if it were done without sudo . 
  in my mind there is , but it 's far from pleasant ... 
  wait ... uhhh , msn !, 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  come on boys , we 're back to msn . 
  do n't think of the computer side of things . 
  think about what sudo might mean in the analogy . 
  i tried to buy a game from them and they flat out refused to accept my purchase . 
  i was overseas at the time , and they claimed they do n't sell to the country i was in . 
  that 's bullshit in this day and age . 
  and even if it were a fair excuse , the reason i wanted to buy from there rather than waiting until i got home was because they displayed the us price . 
  the aussie price was way higher . 
  yeah . 
  i did n't see the lego movie in cinemas , but i liked it enough when i did see it that i might 've gone to see the lego batman movie in cinemas . 
  but if it comes out a month later they can fuck off . 
  i certainly wo n't be watching that in any legal manner .
