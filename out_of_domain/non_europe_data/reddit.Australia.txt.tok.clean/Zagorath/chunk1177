  finger of death was just a randomly selected high level spell for the purposes of demonstration . 
  literally any other option is just as bad . 
  first of all , awwwww . 
  second of all , dat name tho . 
   rich bishop, 
  brilliant . 
  aside from the neo-nazis , i reckon some of these could be people who rightfully have a hatred of the country israel , and unfairly want to take that out on jewish people in general . 
  they 're unable to separate the two in their minds . 
  this probably wo n't help , but you could try pointing out that there actually is an acronym pronounced squirrel , but it 's sqrl . 
  it 's not like instagram has * ever * been the place to go to for quality content , anyway . 
  it 's always been the non-photographer 's flickr . 
  there are variants of poker , such as casino hold 'em , which are designed to be played against the house . 
  yeah . 
  not exactly common , but it definitely is a phrase that gets used occasionally . 
  you would n't say `` make 'em say yowsa '' . 
  it 's just a thing someone might say in reaction to something . 
  it 's not so much about attraction as amazement . 
  probably a decent synonym would be `` holy shit '' . 
  yeah , it 's definitely a ruling that i ignore . 
  it does n't make a whole lot of sense to me . 
  i agree . 
  i think having sunday be worth more than saturday is ridiculous . 
  it would have been better to increase rates on saturday to match sunday , but imo having them both be equal makes sense . 
  was expecting copland . 
  was not disappointed . 
  the only radio stations i listen to are advertising free . 
  [ abc classic fm ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/ ) , for example , is a great classical music station with a fantastic variety of old favourites , new works , and lesser known pieces from the common practice period . 
  it 's available without region-locks worldwide online . 
   i asked if it was a d12 of dmg , he said the predictable, 
  what prompted you to ask that , and what was `` the predictable '' ? 
  what 's wrong with the term spell slot ? 
  i mean , i know a lot of people do n't like the * concept * of them , but the name , to me , makes perfect sense for describing what it does . 
  it 's worth remembering , though , that 4e tried to fix the problems d&d had with nomenclature . 
  it was ( very unfairly , imo ) harshly criticised by many people for doing exactly that . 
  `` it makes it too much like wow '' , they said . 
  people only have themselves to blame for d&d going back to ambiguous `` natural language '' descriptions . 
  `` dungeon levels '' is n't a term in d&d , though the difference between character levels and spell levels is pretty damn frustrating . 
  / r/prorevenge trending because of a clearly fake but oh so satisfying nonetheless story . 
  [ here ] ( / r/prorevenge/comments / 5vg8dj/a _ woman_let_her_dog_shit_on_the_airport_floor_so / ) . 
  how much is it going to cost the end user ? 
  it 's a great idea and i support it in theory , but if it ends up being almost as expensive as flying , like current train options are , then it 's going to sit unused , and be a very expensive niche tourist attraction . 
  independent ? 
  have you left the greens ? 
   no it does n't . 
  why are you asking ? 
   and did he call that baby a whore ? 
  a `` media whore '' , which is a very different thing ... 
   1d8 and a minor effect . 
  but anyway , i 'm not interested in acting out some fictional conversation . 
  why do n't you just answer the question ? 
  so , why did you ask the question to begin with , if your player knew the answer , and did n't ( as far as everything you 've answered so far ) give any reason to suspect otherwise . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you should also be aware that / r/unearthedarcana is not affiliated with the unearthed arcana series of articles published by wizards of the coast . 
  this is a subreddit for * homebrew * material . 
  you can find some nicely formatted compilations of all the unearthed arcana articles on this subreddit or on / r/dndnext , however . 
  search for `` codex '' . 
  here are a few from the abrsm grade 5 pieces in the current syllabus . 
  * [ allegretto grazioso : 3rd movt from sonata in f minor , op . 
  brahms ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsc_ks-32eq ), 
  * [ romanze : 2nd movt from concerto no . 
  3 in bb , stamitz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g5rdr9-2wk ), 
  * [ exercise in c klos\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmokyxzbara ), 
  [ here is a pdf of the complete current syllabus ] ( http://gb.abrsm.org/fileadmin/user_upload/syllabuses/clarinet0514.pdf ) . 
  if you 're planning on taking the exam , i 'd highly recommend buying a copy of the book . 
  it comes with the first three pieces from each group , including accompaniment parts , as well as a cd with recordings of the whole piece , and of just the accompaniment for you to play along with . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  ah , interesting . 
  steps 1 and 2 were fairly obvious , but i was wondering how he stayed balanced . 
  did n't think of step 3 . 
  i feel like it 's too little , too late . 
  plus , if this does n't come with the ability to use your google account as your identification , rather than phone number ( which was a * ludicrously dumb * decision in the first place ) , it 's still pretty much useless in my opinion . 
  needs to be usable on desktop * first and foremost * , rather than being tied to a mobile device . 
  can we maybe not expand myki interstate ? 
  i 've heard nothing but made things about it from victorians . 
  the gocard system , on the other hand , is fantastic . 
  complaints about public transport in seq are not rare , but they 're focussed on infrastructure , timetabling , and prices . 
  the payment system is near flawless . 
   as a reminder of best practices , please ensure that your passwords are distinct across websites ( not reused ), 
  to this end , if you are not using a password manager , ** you are doing it wrong ** . 
  i personally use lastpass because it has a website that can be used to access it on computers without needing to install any special software , and because its security model has been vetted by someone i trust . 
  but keepass , onepassword , or other password vaults are also worth looking at as well . 
  just so long as you 're using a password vault to generate and store long , pseudorandom passwords . 
   writing down passwords, 
  honestly not such a terrible thing . 
  physical security tends to be easier to ensure than digital security . 
  how often do people get hacked thanks to a little booklet being found with all their passwords in it , compared to getting hacked because of using the same password everywhere , or social engineering , or bad server-side practices ? 
  anyway , using a password vault like lastpass is highly recommended in the security industry , and it 's basically the equivalent of writing down passwords . 
  not that enforcing changing passwords is a good idea . 
  fuck anyone who does that . 
  it leads to endless frustrating for users , endless needless work for it support , and users select weak passwords like `` mypassword '' and `` mypassword1 '' , and just alternating between those . 
  that 's no use to anyone . 
  i do n't know which password manager you 're referring to , but the github list linked above has `` 1password . com ( not affected ) '' . 
  so while they may have been a cloudflare customer , they apparently did * not * have plaintext passwords recovered . 
  1password is the only password manager that i recognise listed in the github . 
  and anyway , lastpass ( which is the one i personally use and would recommend to others ) has a model that means that even when vulnerabilities similar to this one are discovered , it generally does n't result in anything being exposed .
