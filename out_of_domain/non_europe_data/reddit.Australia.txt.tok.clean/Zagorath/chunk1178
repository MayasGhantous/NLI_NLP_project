  i 'm not entirely sure why , but i 'm guessing reddit does n't like weebly links . 
  anyway , i 'm not going to manually approve it , because the link is just to the site 's home page . 
  there 's nothing to see at it . 
  if you edit the link to point to an actual post with the monsters in it , then let me know , and i can approve the post . 
  hey , this is still just a link to the blog feed . 
  edit the link to be a ** permalink ** to the post you 're talking about and it can be approved . 
  that seems rather problematic to me . 
  if you change your master password for any reason , your password on every single site you use with it has to be changed simultaneously . 
  i 'm not familiar with how it works , but i 'm also not sure how it would work with 2fa , if it 's possible to use it at all . 
  there 's also some small risk that if two or more of the generated passwords are leaked ( and an even smaller risk if just one of the generated passwords is leaked ) , [ the master password could be obtained much more easily than brute force ] ( http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/11472/34137 ) , and therefore every other password exposed . 
  completely pseudo-random passwords do n't have this flaw . 
  the only way to crack any given site is to either find the master password through brute force , or to crack the user 's password from that specific site through traditional means . 
  but still , it 's a pretty good method to use , and vastly , * vastly * superior to any method that involves a person trying to remember passwords on a site-by-site basis . 
  definitely a worthwhile system . 
   only recently learnt an opossum is different to our possum and is way creepier looking, 
  and also they so frequently call their opossums just `` possums '' . 
  that 's infuriatingly confusing . 
  theirs are not just creepy looking , but from what i 've seen of them , they 're rather aggressive and creepy behaving . 
  john from sydney had the most brilliant comment in the comments thread of that article . 
   if you 're making no exception say even for realtives , why are you excepting your husband , given that fathers are perhaps the greatest risk ? 
  and the reply from one katie was also great . 
   i agree with your comment john , the statistics would suggest that fathers are one of the most likely groups to be the perpetrator of the abuse so why is her husband somehow exempt ? 
   ... also ... 
   what is she going to do about male teachers ? 
   men have to do something really bad to be crippled by guilt . 
  all women have to do is eat a piece of cake , raise their voice or allow their kids to play with an ipad, 
  holy fuck that makes me so fucking mad . 
  so fucking mad i need a word way stronger than fucking to emphasise it , but i literally do not have the vocabulary to express my anger . 
  my dad is n't the perfect father . 
  no one is . 
  but he 's so damn close as far as i 'm concerned he might as well be . 
  at the very least , he 's never done anything especially bad as far as raising me is concerned . 
  but he 's * constantly * down on himself . 
  it hurts me to see how down on himself he is , sometimes . 
  so no , men ** do not ** have to do something really bad to be crippled by guilt . 
  men are people with real fucking emotions just as much as women are . 
   i have n't checked them out because , obviously , i have my own, 
  from what you 've described in the videos , i actually do n't think yours and walrocks are necessarily at odds with one another . 
  they do slightly different things both related to strongholds . 
  but that 's just me guessing based on the fairly few hints you 've given . 
  it 's possible i 'm misinterpreting what yours does . 
  this is a myth . 
  a bizarrely common one , but a myth nonetheless . 
  [ here 's a really detailed explanation of many reasons it 's a myth ] ( / r/askhistorians/comments / 18531f/hello _ historians_who_can_tell_me_more_about / c8bv2dw / ) , and here 's a [ video of one of reddit 's favourite weapons/medieval martial arts experts also suggesting it 's not true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xlt7tm-lts ) . 
  yeah it comes out of britain . 
  but it can be found worldwide . 
  i did my abrsm exams in vietnam , for example . 
  abrsm exams go from grade 1 ( easiest ) to 8 ( hardest normal grade ) . 
  to go higher than grade 5 on performance , you 're required to also take a grade 5 theory exam . 
  practical exams involve a few aspects . 
  your prepared pieces are one piece from each of lists a , b , and c. list b is often romantic era pieces , and frequently lyrical . 
  i did a transcription of rachmaninov 's vocalise for my grade 6 exam , for example . 
  list c is unaccompanied and often consists of technical studies . 
  i 'm not sure exactly how i 'd categorise group a. 
  you also have to do a variety of scales and arpeggios , including chromatic scales and dominant/diminished seventh arpeggios . 
  then there is a requirement to do some sight reading , after about a minute to prepare . 
  and there 's some aural/oral stuff . 
  listening to the examiner play something and clapping back the rhythm , sight * singing * simple passages , etc. 
  abrsm obviously is n't the only exam board out there , though . 
  most will probably be vaguely similar though . 
  australia 's ameb has a similar 8 grade scale , as does trinity college . 
  it 's just that abrsm is what i 'm most familiar with , and as far as i can tell it 's the most widely spread . 
  i tried googling for exam boards in a few other countries , and many of the results that came back were discussion forums asking about abrsm in that country . 
  not that i 've noticed . 
  some orchestras or bands might expect a certain level of playing ability , but i do n't think they 'll necessarily require you have taken a specific exam . 
  it 's mostly just a personal milestone , and a way of having a little more structure to your learning . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what it is you 're trying to say here . 
  but if you wrote down a hashed version of your password , that would be utterly useless . 
  the point of a hash is that it 's a one-way function . 
  writing down a hash of your password leaves you with no way to actually remember or recover your own password . 
  which , if the reason you 're writing it down is to help you remember it when needed , completely defeats the purpose . 
  well , it sorta is . 
  it 's essentially a big encrypted ( ** not ** hashed ) note pad with a list of websites , usernames , and passwords . 
  the key is that encryption can be reversed ( under a key based on your master password ) , whereas hashing can not . 
  blame the irish for those other two . 
  each of them keys off of the stronger or two stats . 
  will is based on your intelligence or wisdom , whichever is higher , for example . 
  they 're also static defences like ac , rather than rolled saving throws . 
  because it does n't make sense that , no matter how hard he tries , the barbarian ( a class fundamentally based around brute strength ) can not be as good at grappling as a rogue who chooses to be a grappler . 
  it 's not about what the rogue us sacrificing to get there , that 's irrelevant . 
  the problem is that the barbarian literally can not beat the rogue no matter what choices he makes . 
  yeah , but it 's also not very realistic that someone spending their entire turn to sprint in circles around an opponent would * not * provoke an opportunity attack . 
  and it 's not realistic or fun that you ca n't just take a couple of quick steps backwards to get out of range without provoking an opportunity attack . 
  and it 's not realistic or fun that flanking an opponent provides no bonus ( and that , with the optional rule , flanking becomes too easy to get , and it 's thus not a great idea to use the flanking optional rules ) . 
  1 ) almost true in this case . 
  but remember we 're just sussing grappling as a stand in for the larger problem , i used it as my example because it 's what you were going with earlier in the conversation . 
  only almost because the rogue still has the higher modifier . 
  he is an inherently `` better '' grappler . 
  but in the many other situations , it 's not even almost true . 
  the wizard has absolutely zero recourse for the rogue being bettered than him at arcana . 
  the cleric has no way to eke back his logical advantage when it comes to religion . 
  that 's the point . 
  expertise somehow makes it so that a rogue can choose to be the ** best ** at something . 
  he can become better at something than most other people are capable of no matter how they try . 
  2 ) no , it does n't matter . 
  for the reasons pretty clearly explained above and in the previous comment . 
  the rogue has flexibility . 
  he gets to say `` do i want to be the best thief , or would i rather outshine our wizard with his arcana ? '', 
  not many other characters have that option . 
  do you happen to know the reason for this change ?
