  a stream so small that no regional or continental map would bother including it . 
  bifurcation rivers significant enough to appear on a country map , except at a delta , are rare enough as to be unheard of . 
  he has to keep soil under him , i think . 
  sorta the reverse of the jar of dirt captain jack sparrow had in the second or third pirates film , to protect him from the dude that could n't step on land . 
  umm , humanoid is generally used in scifi and fantasy to mean any race that walks upright , has a recognisable face structure , etc. 
  humans are humanoid , but so are orcs , elves , klingons , and vulcans . 
  literally just google something like `` facts of the exodus '' . 
  and click on any result not run by a church . 
  here 's an entry from the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_exodus ) . 
  it 's pretty widely established that the israelites were never enslaved by egypt in any significant numbers . 
   the historicity of the story continues to attract popular attention , but the archeological evidence does not support the historicity of the book of exodus . 
  and, 
   there is no indication that the israelites ever lived in ancient egypt , the sinai peninsula shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium bce , and even kadesh-barnea , where the israelites are said to have spent 38 years , was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the israelite monarchy . 
  thanks for the effort bot , but the link above is already non-mobile . 
  it was edited like 10 seconds after it was originally submitted . 
  nah , this spell is fine . 
  * gust * is just really really weak ( in addition to being a bit more flexible with the other bullet points and the range of the spell ) . 
  just compare its effects and damage to * shocking grasp * . 
  very reasonable . 
  hey , just because something is aimed at children does n't mean it ca n't have value for adults too !, 
  i am so fucking confused right now . 
  is this a song ? 
  people actually use nano ? 
  it feels so clumsy and weak compared to vim . 
  * not * believing something for which there is no evidence is ignorant ? 
  fucking hell we really are in a post fact age . 
  i find a lot of the bots that pop up really useful . 
  the tometric bot is absolutely invaluable for the vast majority of the world not stuck in the 18th century , and the one that fixes mobile links is really useful frequently . 
  more niche bots like the xkcd and youtube ones are also great . 
  this particular bot is an especially nice one , because it 's comparatively out of the way . 
  it does n't need to be seen to be useful , so it can just sit at the bottom of a thread where only people who scroll all the way down see it . 
  not just cheap webhosts , but popular other software as well . 
  mediawiki runs off of php , and up until the latest version drupal was entirely php . 
  ( and is still php for logic , just no longer templates or info files . ), 
  personally i would say stay way , way away from node . 
  but i have an intense hatred of javascript . 
  it 's just such an ugly horrible language to work with . 
  so i might be biased against it ... 
   a very good language makes it hard to do it wrong, 
  i find it hard to consider c not a good language , but it certainly fails this test . 
   why tell the stories using anime ? 
  it 's cheaper and easier to tell certain stories this way than to cast actors and build the fantastic sets, 
  sure , but there 's just something about anime * in particular * that makes me absolutely hate it in a way i do n't hate the higher quality western animation stuff . 
  it 's really hard to pinpoint exactly what it is , but the massive overreactions characters always seem to have is definitely a big part of it . 
  both the animation and the voice acting do these bizarre it 's like the entire medium is incapable of doing subtlety . 
  this has been true in my experience with the action adventures that make made their way to '90s / ' 00s kids ' programming in the west like pok\u00e9mon and dragonball , but it 's also true of stuff that seems pretty well regarded by adults like attack on titan , and even slice-of-life anime ( a genre which i would have thought would be the perfect place to find subtlety ) like clannad . 
  you get that a little in western animation , especially in stuff aimed at younger audiences ( the first half of the first season of avatar was pretty bad for this ) , but i 've not noticed it nearly as much in more mature shows . 
  there 's also something in the animation style -- not the art style per se , but the way things move -- of a lot ( not all , but a high portion of anime i 've seen than of western animation ) that feels low quality . 
  i 'd almost prefer less high quality art with better motion , to be honest . 
  yeah multiplayer ones would be really tough . 
  i 've never been able to play the damn game without crazy unplayable lag . 
  plus , where 's the fun in slogging through the combat without the overworld politics and army building ? 
  the latest official unearthed arcana article , traps revisited , can be found [ here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5wibvb/unearthed _ arcana_28022017_traps_revisited / ) . 
  please keep discussions of it to that thread , and to the relevant threads on / r/dndnext . 
   a player, 
  ca n't just say , `` i use thieves ' tools to disable it . '', 
  that 's too murky . 
  the player instead should, 
  describe something like , `` i use my thieves ' tools, 
  to examine the lock and attempt to disable the, 
  poison needle inside it . '', 
  i dunno , those both seem pretty much the same to me . 
  sure , one of them used more words , but it 's the type of words someone might use on an essay if they wanted to pad for length , rather than actually providing substance . 
  a better example might have been with a pressure plate , saying something like `` i use my thieves ' tools to prop up the corners of the plate so that when it 's stepped on it does n't drop down and activate the trap '' , or something like that . 
  just saying `` i use my thieves ' tools to stop the bad thing from happening '' is no better than saying `` i use my thieves ' tools '' in my opinion . 
  ( and , incidentally , it 's for that reason that i would probably be perfectly okay with just letting a player say `` i use my thieves ' tools '' . 
  seems unfair to require a rogue player to know precisely how a real rogue would disable each type of trap . ), 
   aaarrrggghh i hate that i ca n't just save it as a goddamn pdf, 
  hit the `` get pdf '' button in the top right , and then use your operating system 's `` print to pdf '' functionality , or similar . 
  ( if your os does n't have one of those , get a better one . 
  :p macos has had it since at least snow leopard , and windows finally added it in with windows 10 . 
  there are also third party tools that can add this functionality in if you really need to go that route . ), 
  i do n't think they have any servers near me . 
  or at least last time i looked there were n't any playing a game i was interested in . 
  suspension of disbelief is frequently needed with hp , but i do n't think this is such a case . 
  like brainpower said below , it could quote reasonably amputate a person which , without medical attention , could lead to bleeding out very quickly and dying . 
  even with medical attention , if it 's too slow or not the right quality , it could get infected and kill you that way . 
  i mean , that 's nice and all , but we 're talking about moses and the exodus , not jesus . 
  it is indeed well established that jesus probably existed ( without all the ridiculous magic stuff , of course ) . 
  that 's just not a relevant fact to this conversation . 
   left votes being split between labor and greens is what gives the lnp a chance . 
  uhh , you realise neither irv nor stv suffer the spoiler effect , right ? 
  wait , oppo is related to oneplus ? 
  and there i was thinking they were some weird chinese manufacturer of low end shit ... 
  anyone the dm wants to can roll a death saving throw . 
  maybe it 's just because i grew up knowing about the pouch thing , or because the reason for it is relatively obvious , but i definitely think the square poo thing is more amazing . 
  aww yeah i love shifty jelly !, 
  do n't use pocket weather 'cause i do n't really care about the weather enough to pay for it , but pocketcasts is probably my most or second-most ( after reddit is fun ) used app . 
  plus their changelogs are always both so entertaining and informative . 
   it 's like podcasting , but instead of about 10 % of australians using podcasting , 93 % of australians use the radio . 
  and how many of those 93 % are doing it solely for music ? 
  because discounting those people is the only way to make a fair comparison to podcasting , which is most often about talking entertainment and news programming . 
  besides , 10 % is a huge amount . 
  you would n't discount a 10 % market share for a phone or computer company as insignificant . 
  that 's over 2.4 million people . 
  honestly i would be wary of any source book which intends to include homebrew mechanics , especially in such large quantities ( ** 10 ** oaths and ** 10 ** domains ) , and * especially * from someone who has done nothing to show their quality , or that they are capable of designing mechanically sound and creatively interesting new player options . 
  it 's hard enough to come with creative and interesting new player options , let alone ones that are also balanced without getting extensive feedback from a broad community of users ( \u00e0 la / r/unearthedarcana ) . 
  if this were purely setting and flavour material , that would be one thing . 
  but they 're making ridiculous amounts of new mechanics without any real indication that they can do that well . 
  i would recommend avoiding this kickstarter , and maybe pick it up when and if it comes out , if it proves to be decent quality .
