  i actually agree with you regarding the lore wizard though . 
  it 's far too powerful . 
  i do n't think it 's * possible * to `` educate your way out of this trap '' , because i do n't think it 's entirely a lack of education that causes the problem . 
  there are many advantages of taking a single leg trip over a multi-leg one , even if the former may take longer . 
  the biggest of these is convenience . 
  you get on , take your seat , and do n't have to think or worry about anything until you 're at your destination . 
  it 's ease of mind . 
  you also have the advantage of knowing that you 've got your seat . 
  if you have to change , even if * on average * you only have to wait a certain amount of time , it could be as much as double the average even if the timetable is stuck to strictly . 
  if the second bus is late , full , or does n't come * at all * ( which are all legitimate concerns , and even in cases where they 're rare , people generally consider a negative of a certain magnitude to be more significant than a positive of an equal magnitude -- another fairly well studied phenomenon ) , the wait could be even longer than that .

  the clarinet 's non-classical hey-day was during the big band era , with notable performers including benny goodman and artie shaw . 
  goodman 's most well-known number is probably [ sing , sing , sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2s1i_ien6a ) , which is an awesome load of fun , but has a comparatively low amount of clarinet in it , for a piece by a band lead by a clarinetist . 
  it 's almost more of a drum showcase than clarinet . 
  shaw 's most well known numbers are probably [ begin the beguine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcxvxe_yep4 ) , [ nightmare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w59fzowyis ) , and [ his concerto for clarinet and jazz orchestra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkxz1za4jge ) , which is ( in ) famous for ending on a crazy rise up to the c above `` top '' c. 
  there 's also , of course , george gershwin 's [ rhapsody in blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ph0autuu ) , which is more of a piano concerto , but has that famous opening on clarinet , and a couple of other little clarinet solos throughout . 
  plus there 's an arrangement floating around for [ clarinet and concert band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64_vxtos8yg ) . 
  that 's certainly not all there is . 
  not even close . 
  but hopefully it 's a good start . 
  hi sorry , but this post violates submission rule 1 , and as such is being removed . 
  if you want help finding the source of something , try using the subreddit 's search function , or asking on the arcana forge megathread . 
  as a fellow lefty , i feel ashamed for saying this , but this would have worked much better if you were using your right hand . 
  it 's hard to actually see what 's being written . 
  i really liked this composition though . 
  loved some of your other works too , from the related videos . 
  the arrangement of waltzing matilda was absolutely lovely , and while i was n't a huge fan of tra $ h ma $ h , i could n't help but laugh at the pot shot at eric whitacre . 
  some of the lyrical combinations were funny too . 
  i feel like i 've seen the facebook post -- based one before somewhere . 
  did it go viral a while back ? 
  two questions : do you have any orchestral music ? 
  any performances coming up soon at qpac ?

  do n't take a level . 
  that 'll slow your progression of new higher level cleric spells . 
  just grab magic initiate and choose druid and the spell * goodberry * . 
   the media has been more than happy to lie about trump for the past 19 months, 
  no , the media has called him out on his bullshit for the past 19 months .

  anyway , [ here 's a chart that shows the same information as that twitter link ] ( http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/federal-employment-at-record-lows-as-a-share-of-employment-populationyet ) , except it only starts in 1950 rather than 1940 . 
  same downward trend .

  how easy is easy ? 
  f\u00fcr elise is pretty easy and imo a good candidate for practising memorisation . 
  you can start off with just the refrain , which is satisfying enough on its own , before moving on to the b and c sections . 
  it might be too easy for your liking though , i 'm not sure . 
  flair is a tagging system , to allow for easier sorting and searching of content . 
  we have `` spell '' , `` class '' , `` race '' , etc. 
  on this subreddit . 
  you can set it by clicking the little `` flair '' button that appears under your post , choosing the one you want , and then hitting save . 
  as always on reddit , it 's important to read the rules before posting . 
  these can be found in the sidebar of most subreddits , or by clicking a link to a dedicated rules page linked to in the sidebar . 
  if you just want audio ( rather than , say , picking up the specific notes in midi or a similar note-by-note format ) , you ca n't go past audacity . 
  it 's free ( both as in beer and speech ) , and it 's one of the highest quality pieces of free software out there . 
  it 's just audio recording and editing , not a music sequencer or daw , but if that 's what you 're after it 's the best thing available without paying for the expensive adobe stuff .

  useless arsehole is probably a good researcher , which is what brings in grants and gets universities better rankings . 
  here are a few of lindybeige 's videos that i would recommend checking out , for rpg players . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with him all the time . 
  in fact , i might actually say i disagree more often than i agree with him on rpg matters , but they 're interesting and mostly well reasoned anyway . 
  * [ fumbles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wenxydrbcq8 ) . 
  * [ what does die rolling represent ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf8uu4pqefk ), 
  * [ a point about escalation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ye_dage-4 ), 
  * [ in which lloyd fails to understand what `` abstraction '' means in the context of initiative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7isbnd4wu ), 
  * [ dungeon ceilings -- a flaw in design ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkjawdvx5_q ), 
  as a side note , i would really strongly disagree with matt 's recommendation of that kickstarter . 
  check the comments in [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5wlana/a_kickstarter_for_a_deities_and_demigods_style/ ) for more detailed explanation , but it comes down to them making an amount of new * mechanical * homebrew content that makes it very difficult to believe the flavour will be worthwhile , and without any demonstration that their skills in creating balanced content is up to snuff . 
  in fact , what little they have already released for preview leaves a very poor impression of their ability to create good quality stuff . 
  i do n't know about the p&g , but red rooster * certainly * has the better chips . 
  by such a huge margin it 's not even a contest . 
  like usain bolt racing against my little sister .

  i 'm not entirely convinced that red rooster * is n't * a money laundering front , because as you imply , they always seem to be empty . 
  but i do n't even care if they are , because their food is so great , and never having to wait in line is an additional bonus . 
  i mostly get them from the city , but i get them at indro occasionally too and do n't have any particular problem with them . 
  people are upset with the lore wizard not because of the concept , but because the implementation is way too powerful .

  the intent now seems to be that each elemental origin is its * own * origin . 
  tempest , sea , stone , phoenix ( to put them in the order aang learnt the elements ) . 
  the first being in scag and waterborne adventures , and the latter three being in the recent sorcerer ua . 
  i do agree with getting extra spells though . 
  at the moment the sorcerer has fewer spells available to it at any one time than a cleric or druid , by an enormous margin . 
  the cleric and druid * also * have the advantage of greater flexibility , since they can choose spells on a day-by-day basis . 
  so the prepared casters get more options both in the short-term and the long-term . 
  adding a few more spells to the sorcerer would help alleviate this problem a little , as well as make them much more strongly thematic . 
  was one of these perhaps inspired by [ lloyd of lindybeige ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cd6szbtlzm ) ? 
  why not both ?
