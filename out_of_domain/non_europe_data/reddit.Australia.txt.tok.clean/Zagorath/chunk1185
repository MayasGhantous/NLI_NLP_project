  much , ** much ** easier to work with , much cheaper , and has all the features you could need for small scale productions . 
  does n't matter . 
  those are the rules and have always been the rules . 
  most of the time it makes for a massive improvement to the quality of the subreddit , rather than editorialised titles so dramatic you do n't know how trustworthy they are . 
  frankly , linking directly to the legislation is n't very useful anyway , because it 's not something that people can easily read and understand . 
  much better would have been to link to some news article reporting on it . 
  this would have allowed for a more informative headline , as well as the content being easier to understand . 
  here are a few articles i found with a quick search :,

  i looked for one from them , but the latest i found was [ the one where they announced the appeal was going to be lodged ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-30/racial-descrimintation-cindy-prior-appeal-qut-students-18c/8080618 ) . 
   as it is simply a milky way with peanuts, 
  snickers have caramel in them as well as the nuts . 
  it 's more like a mars bar with nuts than a milky way . 
  i actually never even bothered looking at the mechanics of the hexblade , because the flavour of it was just so incredibly dumb . 
  i assume you have n't changed any of the mechanics at all ? 
  i really , really like the flavour you 've got here . 
  it makes a lot more sense than `` talking sword gives out powers to random people who are n't even wielding it '' . 
  it 's really down to how they get their power . 
  a warlock forms a pact directly with an entity . 
  it involves directly ` talking ' with the patron and coming to an agreement . 
  that patron * could * be a god , but is more often a devil or fey . 
  clerics are granted powers by their god as a reward for their devotion and belief . 
  it 's a more hands-off relationship . 
  it turns out that there are indeed differences . 
  the [ american version ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-boq9yccbhze/vchmhoj3lvi/aaaaaaaaoco/itfvhajv-es/s640/american-milky-way.jpg ) is more like a [ mars bar ] ( http://www.englishteastore.com/media/catalog/product/cache/6/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/f/c/fcnd_mar_mar_-00_mars-bar-2014.jpg ) than the version of the [ milky way ] ( http://www.junkfoodtaster.com/wp-content/uploads/03604_3-1024x576.jpg ) found in the rest of the world .

  that 's part of the reason why i very specifically put in that last paragraph . 
  his real name is zachary king , and his [ youtube account is finalcutking ] ( https://youtube.com/finalcutking ) . 
  unfortunately he has n't uploaded in ages . 
  probably too busy with the advertising work he 's doing . 
  [ for example ] ( https://youtu.be/gakfxqdzyw0 ) . 
  yeah i definitely do n't remember it either . 
  does n't help that there are about half a dozen different answers in this thread as to what it is . 
  religious education ? 
  mobile library ? 
  health education ? 
  dental van ? 
  which is it ? 
  i agree that the ensemble cast has not been handled well . 
  guardian is , in my opinion , the absolute worst of this . 
  in an effort to make james relevant to the plot , they forced him into becoming this other character , and it really , really did n't work . 
  i will say that i find some of what you 've said about mon-el ... interesting , coming right after an episode in which he was so clearly the only one in the * right * from the very beginning of the episode . 
  he was the only one * not * behaving irrationally . 
  supergirl is n't the only show suffering from poorly done ensemble casts , though . 
  arrow threw 5 new team members at us this year , all of whom ( with the possible exception of black canary 2.0 ) have been used absolutely terribly and made no sense in the story . 
  they 've thankfully written off two of those , but the ones left still feel out if place . 
  flash has handled things a little better , but it has also added in new super powered characters . 
  i think there might just be something in the water over at cw lately . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  interesting . 
  what age did you have that ? 
  i left the country half way through year 5 and never saw any vans like this before then . 
  there 's a little `` flair '' button under the post that you can press , and then select the appropriate flair , and hit `` save '' . 
  alternatively , if the title includes enough information for the automod to figure out what flair you want , such as '' [ subclass ] '' , or `` school of '' , it will automatically do its best to apply the right flair . 
  the problem with trying to run a murder mystery in d&d , especially one as relatively simple as the board game cluedo , is that there are a heap of spells already in the game that can completely sidestep mysteries . 
  spells like * zone of truth * , * speak with dead * , * detect thoughts * , etc. 
  that 's not to say that cluedo * could n't * be incorporated into a session of d&d , just that it 's going to be tricky , because you 're going to need a way to get around many of the magic spells that can completely short circuit a mystery . 
  playing piano and single-reed woodwind , i do n't really have any choice in the matter . 
  there 's only one way to play the instrument . 
  i do n't play guitar , but it 's definitely more natural for me to hold one the way a righty would . 
  that probably comes from fiddling around with orchestral strings , though . 
  mainly cello .

  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge , but all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions .

  agonising and repelling blasts are both mechanically fantastic options , and repelling blast can be used in a lot of really fun ways . 
  those are definitely the two i would prioritise out of the list you gave . 
  mask of many faces is also really fun , and book of ancient secrets can open up a lot of interesting options . 
  definitely recommend this . 
  the lost mines of phandelver is an excellently written adventure that makes it super easy for new dms and players to go through . 
  you can use the premade characters , with premade backstories that tie in to the adventure , but you can equally create your own characters if you would prefer . 
  the premade characters are an excellent option for people who do n't want to spend the time making a character , or people who are new to rpgs in general , but someone who likes making their own characters and is coming from another rpg might prefer to use the basic rules ( or the phb ) to make their own character . 
  either way works perfectly fine . 
  yeah , greg weisman said that he never understood the need for it . 
  why should speed need a special force from which to draw its power , and not super strength or shape shifting ? 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  best of luck . 
  i 've got this copied and pasted from a while ago . 
   not trying to nitpick , but you once answered that the speed force does not exist on earth 16 . 
  in the dc universe the speed force has been known to bring speedsters through alternate dimensions . 
  the speed force exists on all alternate earths . 
  how is earth-16 exempt ? 
  where does the flash draw his speed from ? 
   i guess i just do n't understand the `` speed-force '' concept . 
   where does superboy `` draw his strength from ? '', 
  where does miss martian `` draw her shape-shifting ability from ? '', 
  why does kid flash or any flash require some external source for speed - as opposed to giving credit to the lab accident that first turned jay garrick into the golden age flash , the recreation of that accident under laboratory conditions that granted speed to the current flash and the nearly-botched attempt to re-recreate the accident that gave kid flash his powers ? 
   they 're mutates .
