  well , no one except actual radical far leftists , not the moderate but extremely vocal left of r/aus . 
  what people want is equal opportunity . 
  that everyone should have a fair chance at succeeding on their own terms , and not start at a massive disadvantage compared to someone wealthier , whiter , or maler than they are . 
  that 's pretty reasonable . 
  and for people who fail to succeed even in those circumstances to still be able to have a life , even if it has fewer luxuries than others . 
  left wing politics is fundamentally about treating people with respect , which right wing politics overwhelmingly does not . 
  what 's that in real units ? 
  not sure exactly when . 
  before 2010 , definitely , and i 'm pretty sure it was after 2007 . 
  i had the opportunity to go a second time when i was in hk on a school trip in late 2010 , but turned it down on account of how disappointing it was the first time . 
  i just tried to check out my subreddits by going to the mobile site from my computer . 
  on the one hand , very pleasantly surprised that reddit is * finally * redirecting desktop users to the desktop site , if they get a mobile link . 
  on the other hand , annoyed at the fact that i ca n't test this easily any more ... 
  that 's a pretty serious flaw on the part of reddit , but i 'm also really confused about how this came to be from your end . 
  what editor do you use that does n't have a `` crop to custom ratio '' option ? 
   1 . the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another . 
  so , uhh , nope . 
  try again . 
   unless you made this to be bad,

  i do n't entirely disagree with you , but i will point out that an iq of 85 is only one standard deviation away from the norm . 
  slightly more than one in six people should be * less * intelligent than that . 
  enough that they 're not exactly smart , but probably not so dumb that you 're going to immediately notice it , either . 
   it 's banned, 
  it 's actually gone private , which is very different . 
  but still , very interesting . 
  i did n't realise that . 
   to say it 's ethical your just lying to yourself, 
  there 's nothing unethical about it . 
  hey , / r/boh5e critic here . 
  note that i 'm just a critic , not a mod . 
  i review things and sometimes help suggest which things we should review , but it 's not ultimately my call , and i do n't run the technical side of things . 
  we work slowly . 
  we 've always worked rather slowly . 
  this latest batch ( the batch from february ) has been a fairly tricky one to do . 
  rule of law is * huge * , and large races has a lot of implications . 
  i would n't be surprised if march gets skipped entirely in order to give february more time . 
  i have n't heard anything from the mod team about this -- in fact , i have n't been in communication with them about * anything * since we selected february 's picks . 
  so i do n't know for sure what 's up . 
  if your dm allows you to be a lore master ( they * should n't * , because it 's * broken * ly powerful , but if they do ) , that is clearly the best choice for someone whose aim is to become the best they can at all the different schools . 
  ## overall score 7.83 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 7/10, 
  the art choices are quite inconsistent in style , ranging from rough monochromatic sketches to near photo-realistic creations . 
  the art is also poorly blended in , with simple images planted straight into the document . 
  none of the ripping and staining that 's seen in the art of the player 's handbook and other official releases . 
  one of the images is clearly meant to be a `` full-page '' artwork , but stops a centimetre or two from the top of the page . 
  having art at all is certainly not a bad thing , and i 'm glad for it . 
  it helps to visualise what these characters are meant to be like . 
  but the inconsistent style and poor blending lends a certain air of amateurishness to the work as a whole . 
  i 'm also not convinced by the oll 's art ; it looks like a kindly wise forest creature , like what i imagine firbolgs to be , not what a half-ogre is going to be like . 
  inconsistency of dialect is an interesting choice . 
  `` grey '' is spelt in the global fashion , but `` color '' in the american one . 
  it 's not a huge problem , but it does throw me off a little . 
  to the creator , my advice would be : if you 're not american , just go with the standard spellings of them . 
  no need to try and force yourself to write in an american way . 
  if you * do * prefer to use american spelling ( yuk ) , make sure to go all the way . 
  the document has a few minor grammatical errors in it as well . 
  hyphens ( '' - '' ) are used when em dashes ( '' -- '' ) should have been -- i noticed this particularly in the half-ogre 's description text . 
  onlings used `` bogeyman '' when clearly the plural was intended . 
  it capitalises race names quite consistently , when races should be treated like any other noun . 
  they are capitalised only when they start a sentence . 
  * umbraturgy * has a bit in its description about `` non-instantaneous effects '' . 
  unlike * prestidigitation * and * thaumaturgy * , this does n't * have * any instantaneous effects , so this bit of wording is unnecessary . 
  ### theme/creativity : 8.5 / 10, 
  for having the sheer guts to come up with a consistent , overarching set of rules to apply to large races , i am really tempted to give this a straight up 10 for creativity . 
  unfortunately , a few minor issues prevent me from doing so . 
  in terms of the large race stuff itself , they all come from areas where changes were made from the core rules on large races . 
  the changes regarding mounts and pushing weights . 
  i 'll discuss them more when i get to mechanics , but for creativity these seem like unnecessary changes , and quite possibly simply errors or oversights . 
  if those were fixed , i would indeed give this a perfect 10 on the large race template side of things . 
  the races themselves are of less interest to me personally , but what is given for them is well written with engaging descriptive text and abilities that feel like they do a good job of reinforcing that . 
  they do , however , lack a racial quote or any more meaningful text description . 
  perhaps these are meant to be more like the monstrous races of volo 's guide , but those lack * any * description at all , and get straight into mechanics . 
  a racial entry should have a quote and more detail on the lore of each of the races . 
  as it is , each race gets only a paragraph or a handful of paragraphs to let the reader know what they 're about . 
  how do they fit in to civilised society ? 
  into their own society ( both the ogre and the other parent , in the case of half-ogres ) ? 
  there 's a lot that could be said that has n't been . 
  consider this score a 9.5 for the large race template , and a 7.5 for the large races themselves . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 8/10, 
  #### large race mechanics, 
  the most important part of this , obviously , is the mechanic for having a character be large . 
  using the detect balance scale , i would rate the `` large '' size presented in this article worth 2.75 . 
  that breaks down as follows :, 
  feature | score, 
  advantage on strength skill checks and saving throws | 2, 
  weapons deal extra 1d4 damage | 0.5, 
  unarmed strike 2 | 0.25, 
  taking up 10 by 10 feet | -- 0.25, 
  increased carry capacity * but not push , drag , or lift capacity * | 0.25, 
  increased grappling capacity | 0.5, 
  difficulty handling small items | -- 0.25, 
  require large mounts | 0 ( see below ), 
  requires additional food , weapons and armour less easy to obtain | -- 0.25, 
  note that there are some significant differences from the way large races are expected to handle according to the existing rules . 
  normally , push , drag , and lift capacity is twice that of carrying capacity , but these rules say they are the same . 
  using the rules from the player 's handbook here would have added 0.25 to the score . 
  mounts are normally required to be one size * larger * than you , and so a large creature would require a huge mount , but these rules imply that a large creature can ride a large mount . 
  i suspect this is an oversight on the author 's part , but it must be reviewed as it is presented , and thus i must criticise it for this change . 
  it seems unnecessary , and slightly increases the power level of large races .
