   no serious gamer or designer would admit to playing it or liking it and whatever it did was considered bad, 
  interesting to learn . 
  one of my favourite games as a kid [ had a little easter egg about d&d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_lzgo7pmzk ) . 
  as a game it was definitely a product of the '90s ( though it came out in 2000 ) . 
  that , plus the immense popularity of planescape and baldur 's gate , made me think d&d was much more influential on the video game industry back then than it is now . 
   advantage means you roll 2d20 and take the highest , instead of just +5 which is what it amounts to statistically . 
  why not just +5 ? 
  because keeping track of many bonuses is tedious and rolling dice is fun, 
  that 's probably 90 % of the reason for it . 
  but the maths plays out * slightly * differently to that . 
  +5 is a best case scenario . 
  advantage is about equivalent to a +5 if the target on the die roll is an 11 . 
  if the roll needed is higher than that , the bonus due to advantage is equivalent to much less . 
  so advantage ends up becoming something that makes you way better at easy or moderate stuff , and only a little better at really hard stuff . 
  an interesting system , in my opinion . 
  a two hour stopover is barely enough time to get to the new gate and get through the extra security in some airports . 
  14 hours is long , but i would hardly say it 's long enough that i would n't know what to do with myself in that time . 
  i 'd assume not to scale . 
  if it * were * to scale , the longest one is as long as 7 -- 10 of the houses , which is totally possible for modern day ships , or for the renaissance period , but is highly unlikely in the early-to-middle medieval period that most d&d is assumed to take place in . 
  it 's most likely that the ship is n't meant to be as big compared to the buildings as it appears . 
  during combat , you always assume they 're looking around in every direction with enough frequency that someone standing behind them would see them . 
  ( this is what / u/schnutzel is referring to . ), 
  out of combat there are no specific rules for this . 
  just play it however you think is most logical . 
  for taking 20 , i would highly recommend reading [ this article ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) . 
  the tl ; dr ( but seriously , ** do ** read it , it 's great ) is that if it is ( a ) possible to succeed , and ( b ) there is no consequence for failure ( consequence could be damage , getting caught by guards , or a bunch of other things depending on context ) , then you should just let them autosucceed . 
  do n't call for a roll . 
   i 'm sure somewhere in history of dnd there has been dragonborn with a tail though, 
  dragonborn were only introduced in 4e , and they did n't have tails there either . 
  pre-4e had the `` dragonborn of bahamut '' which , despite the name , were a completely different race unrelated to the dragonborn , which come from abeir . 
  but the dobs did n't have tails either normally . 
  you had to transfer your bags during a stopover ? 
  i would disallow the eberron stuff and the artificer . 
  not for power level reasons , but because the flavour does n't fit in my world . 
  everything else i 'd take on a case by case basis , but i 'd probably allow most of it . 
   people being luddites, 
  i would argue quite the opposite , in fact . 
  the reason i brought it up was your comment about people 's `` utopian ( read : unachievable ) ideals '' . 
  i find it interesting that there 's this massive backlash currently against immigrants and refugees all over the western world , for `` stealing our jobs '' , when so far , technology ( which is what i believe is far more likely to have substantial impacts on employment in the future , and is already having at least some effect ) and the companies involved in automation are largely lauded for their efforts . 
  there certainly * have * been labour shake ups in the past , but there 's never before been the technology to almost arbitrarily * decide * which types of jobs we can replace by deciding which ones to focus on . 
  that 's what ai is capable of doing , to some extent . 
  it 's a problem a lot of people in the tech industry are very seriously worried about . 
  [ this youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-s557xqu ) does a relatively good job of summarising the issue in a way that 's accessible to laypeople , and it more or less reflects the way i 've been thinking about the problem for a while . 
   that caught me by surprise . 
  would not have pegged you as a greens supporter . 
  good for you . 
  you should have seen the conversations in the greens party room when jeff was in model parliament . 
   where 's wally ? 
  [ oh barry !,

  well in that case literally everything ever was unexpected . 
  the helmet belonging to a trapped person was , the way i viewed it , part of the set up . 
  if something unexpected is going to happen , it has to be after the situation has been set up , much later in the video/gif .

  someone needs to get some erin m. evans into them . 
  ( a ) op is saying this problem * does n't * show up in homebrewery . 
  ( b ) you have * absolute * control in it , if you want it . 
  full html and css capabilities . 
  it just does things manually for you if you 'd rather not take that . 
  plus , photoshop produces a result that does n't have selectable text , which is * infuriating * for the reader . 
  have you tried [ these fonts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/4loka0/fixed_versions_of_solberas_fonts/ ) ? 
  they claim to be `` fixed '' . 
  other than that , i ca n't help you . 
  i 'm removing this post though , because we 're not a tech support forum . 
  you 'll need to contact either the creators of the font , or maybe the creator of homebrewery . 
  they 're the ones that can help you . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions .

  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  yes , that would be absolutely appropriate . 
  but since this post itself does not contain anything useful , i 'm removing it . 
  remember to apply an appropriate flair to your post once it goes up !, 
  i actually misread it at first myself . 
  the problem came when * exporting * a pdf * from * the homebrewery . 
  it displays fine when viewing through the homebrewery 's `` share '' button . 
  i would say this is probably due to a flaw in the font either on op 's computer , or the one being employed by homebrewery during the export process . 
  not really sure . 
  the simplest way is to right click on it within the google drive interface , and click `` get shareable link '' .

  the citation they give is cgp grey via wikimedia commons . 
  anyone know where that is ? 
  googling it only turned up three * different * images which seem to be from the same road trip on wikimedia commons , one more picture on the romanian wiki * pedia * , and a pic on the commons of grey 's face ( whoops ... was not expecting to find that ... ) . 
  even a reverse image search of this image only seems to point back to that article . 
  i 'm just curious . 
  i see the flickr link that could be where they got it , but is it up on the commons anywhere ? 
  since that 's where they 've cited it from . 
  it 's a tagging system . 
  makes searching for things easier . 
  every post on the subreddit needs to have the appropriate flair or be removed .
