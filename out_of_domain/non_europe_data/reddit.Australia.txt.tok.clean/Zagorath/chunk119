  damn ... do they do a generation a year ? 
  yeah , you know , like mathematics . 
  why americans drop the s in maths is absolutely beyond me . 
  correction , they call it maths everywhere other than america ( and * maybe * canada ) . 
  correction : maths is correct anywhere other than the us ( and maybe canada ) . 
  i agree that america is incredibly sue-happy , but in this case it is definitely warranted . 
  the employer legitimately risked that person 's * life * , just so they would n't be liable . 
  i love this about / r/youngjustice . 
  granted , i 've only followed them while the show 's been on hiatus , it may degenerate when the show 's running , i would n't know . 
  very true . 
  i 've never even heard of rico reeds , i 've used vandoren since i started . 
  what exactly is so bad about them , out of curiosity ? 
  what do you think age brackets should be ? 
  it always annoys me when i see 18 grouped the same as 16/17 . 
  18 years old is an adult , and should ( imo ) always be grouped as the lower extreme f whatever age group it 's in , whether it be 18 -- 20 , 18 -- 21 , 18 -- 25 , or something else . 
  it always annoys me when people say this . 
  yes , if your survey is meant in any way to be official then you should have this . 
  if it 's purely for interest , or even `` worse '' ( for lack of a better word ) or high school , then any further confusion is going to make the surveyor 's job harder than it needs to be . 
  yeah , i lost interest in it after obama 's , and then completely lost all respect for it when the eu got it . 
  all except your last points are very good , valid points . 
  but i 'm sorry , the agricultural subsides imposed by the eu are absolutely horrible . 
  sure it might mean a few large european farming companies get to keep a large profit , but dumping in international markets , not to mention simply the inability of foreign -- more efficient -- primary producers to compete on a fair playing field is detrimental not only to those countries but to the global economy . 
  i do n't know what economics classes are like in the eu , but certainly any other curricula will mention the eu subsidies as an example of the negative effects of subsidies/tariffs/quotas , and it can also come up in relation to comparative advantage ( and how they are not following it by subsidising the production of a good for which they have a very high opportunity cost . 
  at the saigon international airport there are a bunch of taxi companies allowed in , but the main ones that people actually use in the city ( and the ones that can be relied upon not to cheat you ) are n't allowed in . 
  your first experience entering hcmc once you exit the airport is being ripped off by shitty taxi companies because the good ones are n't allowed in and shitty ones that ( presumably ) bought licenses are . 
  tip , if you ever visit ho chi minh city and enter via air , walk out of the airport and grab a mai lin , vinasun , or vinataxi , they ( usually ) provide great service and they wo n't rip you off . 
  yeah that makes sense to me . 
  of course , there could be particular reasons in some cases to choose other groupings , but more often than not its probably arbitrarily chosen , and that 's the case where i think your suggestion makes sense . 
  my mum called my gameboy advanced sp a `` playboy '' . 
  many times . 
  i take exception to the, 
   i 've been playing games since the nes so considering your first console was the ps2 i 'd say a lot more than you, 
  bit . 
  the rest of the comment was incredibly apt , but that bit was unnecessary and not at all correct . 
  just because you 've been doing something longer does n't mean you actually know more about it . 
  i suppose you could call this an `` argument from authority '' fallacy . 
  honesty i 've never heard of fallacies outside of logical fallacies . 
  i guess i get lazy and figured the word logical did n't matter . 
  then i guess that makes you [ one of today 's 10,000 ] ( http://xkcd.com/1053/ ) . 
  honestly , i really like lok , but it does n't even come close to meeting the level of the last airbender . 
  still , lok 's good enough that i 'm going to abstain here , because i do n't know which to vote for . 
  edit : actually , i 've decided i 'm going to vote for young justice just because it seems to be having problems with not getting as much attention as it deserves . 
  more votes can only help it . 
  ah , this is awesome !, 
  and they did the full version of bol\u00e9ro , too , rather than one of the shortened ones !, 
  i just wish they had used a better interpretation/recording of the piece , this one is n't the best . 
  definitely gon na check out some more of their music , though !, 
  i 've honestly never been able to work it out . 
  i assume it 's because the legit ones have n't bought licenses to allow them in , but even that is bizarre to me . 
  the legit ones could easily afford to , so maybe it 's some political thing ( corruption is * everywhere * here ) . 
  it would n't surprise me if someone 's greasing palms to keep the legit taxis out . 
  awesome !, 
  i hope you enjoy it !, 
  vietnam 's an amazing place !, 
  i would just say that it could be really daunting . 
  to follow that advise you 'll have to walk out through full-on saigon traffic , so if you 're not an experienced traveller it might be best if you can get some other arrangements . 
  i 'd like chips with that please . 
  til, 
  thanks, 
   terrible at grammar and are syntax, 
  this guy 's telling the truth . 
  in australia it 's actually incredibly normal for people to stay with their parents during university . 
  this is n't a new thing , either . 
  the older one . 
  it 's ok if the age difference is 6 days or less . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ up, 
  [ that simply ] ( http://www.dailywritingtips.com/can-you-start-sentences-with-%e2%80%9cand%e2%80%9d-and-%e2%80%9cbut%e2%80%9d/ ) [ is n't ] ( http://www.legalwritingpro.com/articles/f49-five-grammar-myths.php ) [ true ] ( http://www.writing-skills.com/resources/e-bulletin/october-2011/hit-or-myth-you-cant-start-a-sentence-with-and-or-but ) ( not to mention if it were , you would be in violation of it ) . 
  i get wikipedia 1 , bbc 2 , / r/atheism 3 , [atheists.org ] ( http://atheists.org/ ) 4 , 5 is `` news for atheism , and it singles out an article from telegraph.co.uk , and finally op 's link is 6th . 
  no idea why i 'm getting bbc and telegraph , though . 
  i 'm not british , and i 've never even been to britain . 
  i also never visit either of these websites except when linked there by friends . 
  even in incognito mode you will still get different results to me . 
  google uses all sorts of different stuff , there is no `` standard '' google search anymore . 
  yeah , i do n't necessarily think programming should be taught in primary school , but discrete maths ( not discreet , though i imagine many people wish maths was discreet ) should be more widely taught . 
  that is n't really what he said . 
  ignore the last sentence of naiyo 's first comment and it just shows attitudes changing to a more sane and healthy one . 
  no laws really need to be involved . 
  out of interest , if you 're that concerned about the ` tracking ' , have you considered using duck duck go ? 
  i 'm personally not worried about that kinda stuff , but if i were i reckon duck duck go would be an awesome solution . 
  he deleted his comment . 
  what did it say ? 
  did you get the red wine from classical music ? 
  nearly every classical composer i tried had red wine . 
  it is in dvorak . 
  maybe he 's a dvorak typist ? 
  ( edit : not to mention it could be autocorrect , after all , `` ny '' is n't a word , and both b and m are next to n in qwerty . 
  in fact , that 's probably the more likely explanation . ), 
  well no , there 's a good chance the blue curtains were just blue curtains . 
  remember , what we read into it is still a valid point even if the author did n't do it with that intention . 
  so even of the curtains were actually just blue we can infer other things from it and not be wrong . 
  i hear this all the time but i 've never had a teacher do that . 
  if you can back up your claim it 's fair game . 
  edit : fuck , it rhymed . 
  i should be a poet . 
  now kiss, 
  i think this is the best assessment given on this page . 
  some others get really close ( / u/tripsoro in particular ) , but you * really * hit the nail on the head . 
  of course , it 's interesting that we 're talking about pathos and linking to sonata no . 
  8 , when the picture shows precisely that sonata , specifically the second set of ideas of the exposition ( if you ignore the grave section , which is itself a set of thematic material and not simply an `` introduction '' ) . 
  only if you ignore the grave section , which is often passed off as an `` introduction '' , but it is n't .
