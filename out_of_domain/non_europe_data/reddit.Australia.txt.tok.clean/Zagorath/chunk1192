  i just had a session where i could * really * have used some of this stuff . 
  i just chose one from the lingering injuries table in the dmg that felt sorta fitting instead . 
  i love most of the elemental ones , but i 'm not a fan of the fire one , and i do n't really understand the reasoning behind the force one . 
  the physical ones are bloody awesome . 
  my suggestion would be to treat force the same as physical , personally . 
  you say this is too much bookkeeping , i say the raw encourages unrealistic and annoying yo-yoing . 
   poison penalty vastly outscales hp growth, 
  the penalty is twice your level . 
  the minimum most characters should be gaining is three per level , and that 's if they 're a d6 hit die character with a -- 1 con mod . 
  anyone with a better con mod and/or hit die ( which , in my experience , is somewhere around 90 % of characters ) will have hp growth outscale the penalty . 
  true , but as far as rules are concerned , we need to describe the average case . 
  rolling for hp has an average case of 0.5 less than taking the average ( which is why it 's objectively the wrong decision to make , if you 've got the option ) , so even in the d6 -- 1 case , you 're still better than 2 , sitting at 2.5 . 
  a lot of things could happen . 
  they could very reasonably choose to retire after that . 
  if they do keep going , they might or might not decide to take on a name , for any number of reasons . 
  maybe they decide to form an adventuring company and need a name with which to market themselves , but maybe they just see another threat that they jointly want to face . 
  bit late in the year to still have your happy new year signs up , do n't you think ? 
  even if they 're up in reference to tet rather than the solar new year . 
  what does n't work for me is the more ensemble-based cast this season compared to last . 
  james olsen and winn superheroing together , kara 's sister and the cop 's whole bland relationship . 
  and i 'm really not sure what the main plot even is at this point . 
  the show as a whole , i still quite enjoy . 
  regarding only the last 6 episodes or so it 's probably my favourite show in the arrowverse . 
  flash might beat it ; worst case it 's a close second . 
  but i 've just been really bored by the other shows by comparison . 
  legends has always been and always will be trash , and arrow has had the same unfocussedness as supergirl , but to the n ^ th level and with less interesting stories for its main character . 
  kara is still such a great character and she really holds the whole thing together in my opinion , but just barely . 
  up the top left in gold writing on a red background . 
  it seems to say chuc mung nam moi , which is vietnamese for happy new year . 
  they use it both for the gregorian calendar and for tet , which is their name for the lunar new year . 
   d&d psionics has been more `` crystals and hyperbolic self-help books '' than `` i can kill you with my brain '' for a long time , and wotc seems to think people prefer it that way . 
  i 'm still in the process of reading through this latest iteration , but from the previous two drafts i definitely got the impression that it 's more the latter than the former . 
  and 4e 's psion was ** very ** heavily the latter , with basically none of the weird mystical vibe . 
  it was just straight up m'gann m'orzz / j'onn j'onzz . 
   the defining class identity in this iteration seems to be that mystics are weirdos with psychic powers , instead of being otherwise average folk . 
  well i hope you mention that in the feedback survey next week . 
  i probably will . 
  but one voice alone ca n't sway them . 
   i do n't remember 4e too well , but i remember psi-forged and lots of weirdness about crystals, 
  the only psionics class i looked at was the psion itself , and it did n't have any stuff like that , from what i remember . 
  the psiforged , as far as i can tell , is a race like the warforged but psionicly adept . 
  they 're an eberron race , and in eberron you kinda * have * to accept that kind of weirdness . 
  plus , as weird and `` out there '' as living crystals might be , they 're not exactly the same as the pseudo-buddhist eastern mysticism stuff most of your criticism revolves around . 
  the shardmind race is another example . 
  they have some really cool but exotic background to them , but it feels very deeply rooted in d&d style fantasy , rather than real-world eastern mysticism ( or western perceptions thereof ) . 
   also , as cool as martian manhunter is , i really prefer my psions to be more like carrie , river tam , charlie , or even tetsuo, 
  eh , to each his own . 
  i do n't know any of those other characters , but the martians , particularly as portrayed in the young justice tv show , are pretty much the ** perfect ** example of what i want out of psionics . 
  though assuming the powers are similar , i see no reason that both could n't be possible given the same mechanics and options to choose from . 
  i 've been thinking along these lines for a while . 
  the reason cartoons like young justice and avatar can be so great at showing super powers/magic in action , while most live action tv shows just ultimately fail to be as exciting , is due to the relative cost . 
  good action in a cartoon costs the same as good mundane scenes ( i say * good * mundane scenes , to differentiate it from the * bad * mundane scenes seen in a lot of anime , where people stop moving at all most of the time during these scenes ) , but in live action shows , the mundane stuff is much cheaper , and the action -- even when it is done -- tends to be much less interesting or engaging . 
  the action by necessity feels less like we 're really watching these characters with superpowers fight how they would fight . 
  more people should pay attention to the unix philosophy . 
  not all of this is applicable to bots in a chatroom , but a lot of it is . 
  make each program do one thing well . 
  to do a new job , build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new `` features '' . 
  expect the output of every program to become the input to another , as yet unknown , program . 
  do n't clutter output with extraneous information . 
  avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats . 
  do n't insist on interactive input . 
  design and build software , even operating systems , to be tried early , ideally within weeks . 
  do n't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them . 
  use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task , even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you 've finished using them . 
  or , more succinctly ( and more broadly applicable ) :, 
   * write programs that do one thing and do it well . 
   * write programs to work together . 
   * write programs to handle text streams , because that is a universal interface .

   duel wielder is ** not ** worth it unless you already have 20 dex . 
  duel wielded allows you to go from a d6 to a d8 , which is +1 damage on average . 
  increasing your dex modifier by 1 also gives you +1 damage , but additionally increases your a.c. , dex ability checks and saving throws , and your initiative . 
  it also gets you a +1 ** to hit ** , which means that the amortised increase in damage by taking the asi is actually more than just +1 per attack .

   why is the word mistress , shortened to `` mrs. '' ... the word missus , shortened to `` ms. '' , is the title of a married woman, 
  this is not correct . 
  at least not how i 've heard it used . 
  `` mrs '' is pronounced `` missus '' , while `` ms '' is `` miss '' , or sometimes `` mizz '' .

  prestige classes are explained in [ this unearthed arcana article ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) . 
  they 're a separate class that you multiclass into like any other class , except they have higher minimum requirements , and they do n't last for a full 20 levels , so you ca n't start in them . 
  they usually represent some specialist character concept that could conceivably be taken by a wide range of characters ( so it does n't make sense as a subclass ) , but which also come with some substantial effort on the part of the character ( so feats , backgrounds , etc. 
  are insufficient to get them and stay balanced ) . 
  the best example of a prestige class i 've seen is probably [ the vampire prc ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) , by the_singular_anyone . 
   i grew up thinking that miss and ms. were different . 
  miss meant `` unmarried '' and ms. was for people who did n't want marital status to be in their title . 
  i grew up using `` miss '' or `` ms. '' for unmarried women ( in both cases , pronounced miss ) , but `` ms. '' ( in this case pronounced mizz ) for unspecified . 
   or witness serious harm come to someone or something you care about, 
  neat , but this would benefit from more detailed explanation . 
  something like, 
   or witness serious harm come to someone or something you care about , such as seeing a party member drop to zero hp,
