   in general most pcs will be facing a majority of monsters/creatures with natural weapons . 
  which ignore the resistance, 
  huh ? 
  it specifically says that only * magical * weapons ignore the immunity . 
  if you 're going up against orcs with their greataxes , goblins with their scimitars , wolves with their bites , or giant wasps with their stinger , all of that is something that your werewolf option is going to be immune to . 
  you 're only going to be ignoring the resistance if you 're going up against enemy spellcasters , or enemies with weapons powerful enough that the dm decides it should be enchanted , like a high level blackguard for example . 
   does no one know the actual rules on lycanthropy in 5e ? 
  oh no , i 'm fully aware of it . 
  it 's specifically because of this that i am * not * comparing to it . 
  it 's a terrible terrible option that should never be used for players . 
  or at least if it is used , only as a very temporary curse that is removed as quickly as possible . 
  same with the raw vampire option . 
  that 's why the homebrew community has come up with much better alternatives for both . 
  indeed , that 's what it * seemed * you were trying to do here . 
  unfortunately , what you have come up with is still brokenly powerful . 
  as i said , once i got to the point where it was at a 9 on the detect balance scale , i stopped counting any further . 
  but i would n't be surprised if it 's nearly double some of the phb races in power . 
  if you want someone to be able to play a werewolf in a fairly balanced way , look to that prestige class i linked you before , and let them use * only * the level 0 stuff . 
  that 's pretty heavy on the * curse * aspect of lycanthropy . 
  and there 's room to expand if you want to . 
  read the entries . 
  even bite , claw , and sting type attacks are described as `` melee ** weapon ** attacks '' . 
  the errata makes things clearer , but it did n't actually change the rules at all . 
  i do n't like it because it 's got this ugly weird asymmetry to it in the controller . 
  seems uncomfortable to hold . 
   how much of that is skill , and how much of that is biology, 
  as much as i love the image of bruce using psionics being part of the reason for batman 's awesomeness , i honestly think that in the dc universe , for the martians , * all * of it is biology . 
  skill and training can be used to increase their power , but having the power at all ( and also to some degree the amount of raw power they have ) is determined by biology . 
  i do n't necessarily think the origins should be the same in d&d . i actually am not sure whether i prefer it be about training like wizardry that anyone can do given enough effort and a good teacher , or for it to be a natural in-built thing some people happen to have like sorcerers , or if they need to gain it through an accident , also like sorcerers . 
  the main thing i * am * sure of is that i like the way the powers * present * themselves in dc 's martians . 
   taking a cut of profits from selling on their store is kinda reasonable , even if 50 % is a little steep, 
  the apple app store and the google play take a 30 % cut , and they give developers a far better deal than the dungeon master 's guild does . 
  for one thing , they are the best platforms for distributing the type of content they host . 
  the dm 's guild has worse content than what 's available elsewhere and does n't encourage improving that content . 
  it does n't have a system for automatically pushing updates . 
  they have n't given out really great robust tools for helping to * create * content in the first place ( like the android studio ) . 
  and , possibly most importantly , they do n't help with exposure by having useful curated categories of high quality stuff regularly updated . 
  for doing far less than the most popular mobile device app stores do , and while being worse than the competition ( like / r/ua ) for consumers , the dm 's guild has the gall to ask for a much larger cut of profits . 
  it 's more than just `` a little steep '' , in my opinion . 
   there 's nothing wrong with psionics being a flavor of magic, 
  yes , there is . 
  psionics is its own completely unique thing . 
  there are some aspects of * this * mystic that blur the lines a little too much ( / u/anathemys had a great comment in a different thread that details precisely why ) , but a well-crafted psionic class should make it very clear in both mechanics and flavour ; ** psionics is completely distinct from magic ** . 
  this is at the core of what psionics ** is ** , and changing that is to fundamentally misunderstand what makes psionics cool . 
  you mean the best apart from 5e , surely ? 
   since we 're discussing the design ethos of 5e , it was excluded from the comparison, 
  i thought so ; i was just making sure . 
  thanks for you submission , but it has been removed . 
  / r/dndgreentext is for sharing roleplaying * stories * shared through the medium of text . 
  gameplay advice or ideas would be more appropriately shared at / r/dnd . 
   nothing should be able to kill you without any overt sign it is doing so, 
  personally , the way i would always run psionics , and the way i think wizards should describe it in the same way , is that there are no really big grand gestures like those required by magic . 
  instead , psionics requires an intense ( albeit brief , in the case of some psionic abilities , like the basic ~ ~ cantrips ~ ~ talents ) focus , which would be visible to a close observer , but not as obvious as the big hand waves of a spell with a somatic component . 
  i 'd maybe require an investigation check with dc 15 or so to be able to discern the source of a psionic ability , whereas you can instantly know where magic is coming from unless it 's * subtle * . 
  that 's not what the rules say * at the moment * , but it 's how i 'd play it , and i think that 's ideal . 
   nope , they 're using magic !, 
  quote : `` psionics is a special form of magic use , distinct from spellcasting . '', 
  that 's not how it 's been in previous drafts or in previous editions . 
  they really need to change that back before official release . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  aww , this is adorable !, 
  i love it !,

  link ? 
  it 's important to note that not following a trope is different to subverting it . 
  trope subversion is where you set something up to appear as though you 're going to follow the trope , and then not doing it -- especially if you do the exact opposite . 
  for example , in my world , gnomes are like harry potter goblins . 
  serious and bureaucratic . 
  i did this is provide a more adequate differentiation from halflings than the phb gnomes . 
  but this is ** not ** subverting a trope , because there was no set up . 
  it 's just something that happens to be different . 
  trope subversion can be a powerful and interesting element when used properly . 
  but unless you 're doing a deliberately meta comedy campaign , you probably want to keep trope subverting fairly limited , or it 'll lose its punch . 
  do it consciously to surprise your players -- to subvert their expectations -- and not just for the sake of changing things . 
  4 football codes ? 
  more like 2 plus some stragglers . 
  how big are union or soccer compared to league and afl ? 
  got ta be tiny . 
  no fucking way soccer beats league or cricket . 
  if be surprised if it 's even more popular than union , outside of the world cup . 
  4e definitely did n't change what psionics is . 
  if anything , it went in the opposite direction , making the source by which clerics and paladins get their power ( the divine ) distinct from the source by which wizards and sorcerers do ( the arcane ) , rather than just lumping then all into `` magic '' . 
  unfortunately , this latest draft did quite specifically claim psionics is a type of magic , albeit one that does n't involve spells . 
  i definitely intend to tell them to correct this is the survey next week . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  is n't it syntactic ambiguity in this case ? 
   mystic does not sound like a psionic class, 
  agreed . 
  i 'm not a fan of the name . 
  i do n't think it 's a * huge * issue ( a rose by any other name , and all that ) , but it 's not ideal . 
   the soul blade and the wu jen just do n't fit in, 
  i 'm undecided on the soul blade , but agree completely that the wu jen does n't belong . 
  psionics is completely distinct from magic , and having a psionic class casting fire balls is completely off . 
   when i think of psionic powers i think of mind control and telekenesis , not summoning elementals or walls of thunder, 
   it 's a pretty recognized trop that people using psionics powers have to use hand gestures or some visible signal that they 're using their powers, 
  is it ? 
  for some types of powers perhaps , but when i think of a psion using telepathic powers -- mind reading , attacking their mind , etc.
