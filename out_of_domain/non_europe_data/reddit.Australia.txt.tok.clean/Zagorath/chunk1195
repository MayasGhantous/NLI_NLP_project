  -- the biggest sign i imagine is an intense focus washing over the psion 's face , or * maybe * at ** most ** them reaching up and touching their temple with one hand ( the professor x manoeuvre ) . 
   right now , psionics is in this awkward place of being magic but not spells, 
  this is part of the problem . 
  psionics should n't be in that place , because it should n't be magic . 
  it 's something completely different to magic . 
  it has been in all the previous drafts of the 5e mystic , and it has been in other editions . 
  i do n't know why it was changed in this edition , but it needs to be changed * back * before the final release . 
  i would urge everyone to point out this poor judgement call when the survey comes out , and ask that they fix it . 
  ** psionics is not magic ** . 
   monsters could have resistance to psionics , or spels , or both, 
  they already can . 
  resistance or immunity to psychic damage already exist . 
  10 creatures are immune to it entirely , and 1 is resistant . 
  that said , they could quite easily add in counterpsionics and anything else necessary -- including addenda to other creatures to give them psionic resistance similar to `` magic resistance '' -- as part of whatever source book they finally release psionics in , if they want to . 
   do they ever change size ? 
  yes , sorta . 
  m'gann is ( ** huge spoilers ** for young justice here ) actually a white martian who has simply transformed into and is pretending to be a green martian , and white martians are a lot larger than green . 
  think the difference in size between goliaths and humans in d&d . 
  there 's also one occasion where m'gann goes into really deep water , and the pressure from it shrinks her . 
  when she * leaves * the water , she stays shrunk , until someone points out that she 's smaller than normal , and she uses her shapeshifting to grow back to normal size . 
  in the young justice tv show ( but not , as far as i 'm aware , in all other iterations of dc lore ) , beast boy is also created thanks to a martian blood transfusion , so his transforming comes from the same place . 
  he transforms into creatures as small as chickens and as large as whales . 
  transforming actually is n't a part of my ideal psionics either . 
  neither is conjuring physical items ( something that was possible with the 4e `` shaper '' subclass ) . 
  but it * is * something that i 've seen associated with psionics in the past , so i 'm sorta okay with it existing in the 5e psionic class , just so long as it 's part of an optional power you can * choose * , rather than being a main class feature . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hardly . 
  they 're mostly repeating the same concerns people have expressed numerous times before and have been pretty handily refuted already in comments and podcasts . 
  someone linked to a comment by an economist arguing against humans need not apply , who was claiming that the automation we 're likely to see over the next decades is * not * on an unprecedented scale , which is so obviously false it 's just not even * worth * responding to . 
  heaps of people repeating the same tired arguments against americapox . 
  there was one moron who claimed `` first past the post '' is the wrong word to use to describe a plurality voting system , as though that is n't by far the most widely used term to describe it ... and then used that to claim that grey has no understanding of voting systems . 
  that was rather amusing to read . 
  i find his information absolutely great , but his style incredibly grating . 
  the overly dramatic readings , which work as a dm , just do n't work nearly as well in an informational video , imo . 
  given their username , i have to assume it 's satire . 
  what you 're doing here is very similar to what you did in a thread recently regarding the abc . 
  you 're committing a balance fallacy . 
  simply put , both sides of an argument do not always have equal merit , and in that case , they do not necessarily deserve equal public attention . 
  let 's try this , mate . 
  if someone was going around claiming 2 +2 = 5 , would you agree that they deserve to have just as much air time and media exposure as someone saying 2 +2 = 4 ? 
  if so , then the discussion ends there . 
  you are so far removed from reality that there can be no more conversation . 
  if not , then you 've already proven your previous comment wrong . 
  from there , it 's just a matter of quibbling over degrees of precisely which arguments are deserving of how much merit . 
  well damn . 
  i 've been playing them wrong all along !, 
   the first wants an elven stealth mage who can shoot with a bow as well . 
   we ended up with a wizard, 
   i was thinking about ranger as well but that seems too little magey to me, 
  huh ? 
  ranger was * too * magey , so you went with wizard instead ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  for the battlemage , ask him what flavour he 's interested in . 
  does he want to be devoted to a cause ? 
  a devout worshiper of some particular god ? 
  tempest or war cleric . 
  an extremely skilled warrior who uses magic to enhance his abilities ? 
  eldritch knight fighter . 
  a mage who has also learnt to elegantly wield a sword , almost as though dancing ? 
  yes , you * could * reflavour any of these to more accurately fit what he wants , while getting the mechanics he wants . 
  but really , the classes are built with particular themes in mind , and the themes reinforce mechanics * so well * , that you 're losing some of what makes them great if you do . 
  if it 's your first time , i would ** highly ** recommend * against * moving class features around . 
  learning how to do that well is difficult , and the classes as designed work really well . 
  this extends to the changes you 're suggesting for the orc . 
  really ? 
  i find that very odd , since it 's pretty clearly just taking actual english words and jumbling them up in funny ways . 
  there are parts of it where you can almost think they actually * are * speaking english . 
  the technical term for it is an `` escape character '' . 
  not terribly worded . 
  that was all my error . 
  ah yes , my bad . 
  someone reported it and on my quick scan in response to that , it looked light on mechanical terms , so i just assumed it was n't a fleshed out mechanic . 
  i wo n't reinstate it though , because after 9 hours , thanks to how reddit 's algorithms work , even if i did , no one would see it . 
  you 're best off reposting it . 
  you 're definitely not alone . 
  it would cheapen death in general , take away emotional impact and character development that happened as a result of this particular death , and require introducing a new element to the story that the producers have said in no uncertain terms they do n't understand or enjoy , which could only mean that if they do it , it 's not because it 's what they see as best for the show , but because they 're pandering to the audience . 
  so i definitely really hope wally 's stays dead for good . 
  it stole half their name !, 
  why would they possibly * not * hate them ? 
  nah but seriously , i did n't even know this was a thing . 
  i ca n't help you . 
  it was n't even that much of a lie . 
  the fireflies * had * found other patients with her condition , and * had * tried to use them to find a general cure . 
  they had failed . 
  joel had every reason to believe that they were trying in vain and that her death would be meaningless . 
  he lied to ellie , but it came from a place of personal truth , and even the facts were partially true . 
  did you find and listen to the tapes as joel was making his was through the hospital ? 
  they make it pretty clear that they 'd tried and failed in the past to find a cure from immune patients . 
  the doctors still had hope that ellie might be their answer , but you ca n't blame joel for being doubtful after finding that information . 
  of course , the fact that the tapes are bonus collectible items , and not a main part of the story , suggests that joel would have done what he did anyway . 
  not everybody 's joel will have found out about that , after all . 
  but if he * did * find them , his decision is a lot less morally ambiguous . 
  ninja edit : [ here 's one of the tapes on the wiki . 
  ] ( http://thelastofus.wikia.com/wiki/surgeon's_recorder ), 
  something something / r/unearthedarcana something ? 
  openoffice ( or libreoffice , which seems to be what the foss guys prefer these days ) only has the basics . 
  word processor , spreadsheet , presentation , plus some tools to aid creating specific parts of those , like a basic graphics editor , an equations editor , and a chart creator .
