  no note taking tool . 
  is that a fourth draft of the base rules , or of the expansion you released at one point ? 
  also , does n't having it on the dm 's guild mean you 're not allowed to host it elsewhere ? 
  i thought that was in their terms of service ? 
  not that i 'm gon na go dobbing you in , i do n't care for the guild or its dumb rules anyway . 
  our fish and chips are better than what passes for that in england , even if they did invent it . 
  it 's well known in australia for being `` the place we ship our asylum seekers '' . 
  i think part of the problem is that grey has a mix of educational videos and what i like to call video persuasive essays . 
  his videos on electoral systems and borders are educational facts presented in an accessible way . 
  some of his more recent videos like americapox and humans need not apply are persuasive essays where grey has an opinion and presents it with well-researched backed up claims -- but they are still fundamentally persuasive essays . 
  so , this might seem like an even dumber question than op 's , but what does `` germanic '' actually mean ? 
  like , intuitively it would mean people from the area now called germany , but it 's applied to a lot of tribes where that seems at least somewhat counter to that idea . 
  the [ goths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goths#/media/file:germanic_tribes_ ( 750bc-1ad \\ ) . png ) , who started in scandinavia and migrated south as widespread as france and poland . 
  the [ teutons ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/cimbrians_and_teutons_invasions.svg ) , who started in denmark and migrated as far south as northern italy and as far west as portugal ( which in itself absolutely * fascinates * me ; how a whole culture can migrate like that -- down and back -- while staying classified as a single culture ) . 
  and the franks , who ended up giving their name to france , a country in some ways * defined * by * not * being germanic . 
  sorry , it 's just a weird question that 's bugged me for some time . 
  how is death meaningless , let alone a * running joke * ? 
  we have so far had * zero * characters come back from true death , and only once ( that i can remember ) had a death fake-out -- and even that lasted at most like one episode , and not even over a * midseason * break , let alone over a season . 
  wally * ca n't * come back because despite your claims , it * would * cheapen both his specific death and death on the show in general . 
  ** best ** case scenario ( for those who want him back ) is he comes back after many years in show-time and at least half a season in real time . 
  it 'd be unfaithful to the show to do otherwise . 
  that might be true in this case . 
  but i have seen people -- including maet here -- use this same argument in cases where it * is * a matter of fact . 
  it 's most infamous when it comes to climate change or the ( lack of ) health risks of vaccines . 
  as for this specific case , i do think there are strong reasons that one could argue there * is * a truth to it . 
  that allowing one group of people a right that in no way infringes on or even aids the infringement of anyone else 's rights or privileges is an objectively good thing and no reasonable argument can refute it . 
  the only arguments against it come from a place of pure hate . 
  quite different from opinions on things such as economic policy , capital punishment , or abortions , where genuine philosophical and moral opinions can come in to play . 
  no , it 's detect balance . 
  i just hate the fact that the guy randomly multiplied stuff by 4 . 
  the numbers are so much harder to work with that way . 
  so i fixed that . 
  musicus has no quarter points . 
  not my fault the guy refuses to budge . 
  he started out with a pretty sensible system -- +1 for an asi like musicus , but with fixes where that system stumbled -- and borked it all up on a `` testing '' basis , then when it proved as moronic as expected decided to keep it that way anyway . 
  i figure people can work out from context what 's going on . 
  +1 for an asi makes it pretty clear . 
   or linux, 
  so long as you 're not using ubuntu , which has had ads in it for much longer than windows has . 
  ( incidentally , even ubuntu variants like kubuntu -- which is my flavour of preference -- * do n't * have ads . 
  just ubuntu itself . ), 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  okay i absolutely love this . 
  but unfortunately it does n't belong here on / r/dndgreentext , so i 'm removing it . 
  this place is for sharing stories about roleplaying games . 
  try submitting to / r/dnd and / r/dndnext instead . 
  if you have n't already purchased sibelius , it might be worth looking at dorico as a possible alternative . 
  i have no idea what the sound library situation is like for them ( i have n't actually tried it yet ) , but development on sibelius has largely stagnated , whereas dorico is the new kid on the block getting regular substantial updates . 
  in terms of user experience in notation it seems to be a strictly better option than sibelius . 
  anyway , if you 've got the 30 + gb library that comes with sibelius , the sounds are easily good enough to compose with . 
  not brilliant for playing back as a * performance * , but good enough that if you have the ideal sound in your head , sibelius will give you a good enough idea of whether or not your composition matches it . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  no need to escape them on this subreddit .

  it 's got some amazon stuff built right in . 
  [ here 's an article detailing what the user needs to do to remove it . 
  ] ( http://lifehacker.com/5953180/how-to-remove-amazon-ads-from-ubuntu-1210 ) the screenshot is the most pertinent bit . 
  both the circled part ( which is all advertising ) , and the amazon logo in the sidebar -- which is there by default . 
   if you do n't use ubuntu - what 's your flavor ? 
    even ubuntu variants like kubuntu -- which is my flavour of preference, 
  i do n't notice any glaring issues with balance , but here is a more appropriately formatted version of it . 
  i also fixed up some of your grammar since it seems as though english is n't your first language . 
  you can feel free to click the `` source '' button and copy-paste that all across to your version if you want . 
  oh okay , fair enough . 
  some of the errors you were making are common of esl students , especially those who speak languages that do n't use articles , like slavic languages and to some extent nordic . 
  sorry for assuming . 
  anyway , i did n't notice the legendary actions the first time . 
  i 've added those and the description into the document now . 
  i feel like spam should stay highly visible , but other than that , the reddit-wide rules should be less prominent than subreddit specific ones . 
  i do n't think i 've ever had a case where one of the other site-wide rules was broken on my subreddits . 
   australia produces vast quantities of fantasy literature, 
  it does ? 
  how interesting . 
  all of the fiction from aussie authors that i 've read has been action/adventure type stuff , with a little soft sci-fi thrown in for good measure . 
  stuff like matthew reilly 's ancient wonders series and john marsden 's tomorrow series . 
  who 're some good aussie fantasy writers ? 
  edit : wait , is garth nix australian ? 
  it just occurred to me that he might be . 
  i read some of his stuff when i was younger . 
  looks like you also got a nat 1 on perception . 
   if you genuinely believe that a microwave by itself is capable of spying on someone , then you are objectively retarded . 
  it 's been well understood by anyone with a modicum of sense for a * long * time that trump and his * team * are either objectively retarded or ( more likely ) manipulative liars on a scale far ** far ** exceeding even the worst of other politicians , and that his * supporters * are in the former camp . 
  trump 's team actually came out with a statement claiming to have been spied upon by obama using a microwave . 
  this is just more evidence supporting the above . 
  that 's how it 's political . 
  pure speculation here , but i wonder if it 's because `` niger '' , in english , is pronounced with a soft g ( and that the e acts as a `` magic e '' ) . 
  add the extra g to demonstrate that it 's pronounced with a hard g. 
   what 's interesting is that n * gger was n't initially derogatory . 
  it simply meant black person . 
  i thought that was kinda obvious ? 
  it became thought of as derogatory because how can a word being used most often to describe slaves * not * become derogatory ? 
  are they playing beethoven 's symphony no . 
  [ all those concert as ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ruprqpk.png ) . 
  plus the open strings in the first violin and contrabass . 
  damn , controversial comment apparently , just for speaking your mind , if the downvotes are anything to go by . 
  i fully agree . 
  actually , i 'd go further . 
  i find aoe ii utterly unplayable . 
  the pathfinding is awful , trying to find units that get stuck behind trees or buildings is a pain , trying to get units to target something ( like gold ) that 's located behind trees or buildings is even worse , and the needlessly complicated set of buildings and upgrades is just a pain to work with . 
  the peak for the franchise was age of mythology .
