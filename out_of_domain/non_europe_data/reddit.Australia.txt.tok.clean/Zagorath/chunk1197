  aoe iii was a small step down from that , but still way , way better than aoe ii . 
  can i defer ? 
  probably mount & blade : bannerlord . 
  if i had to pick a game that 's out today though , it 'd be age of mythology . 
  best rts game ever made . 
   submissions must by [ sic ] ** stories ** that relate in some way to tabletop role playing games, 
  ( and yes , i did just '' [ sic ] '' myself . 
  will fix that asap . ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/about/rules also makes it fairly clear . 
  yeah once you did n't respond for a few hours i went ahead and tried submitting it to those subs myself . 
  / r/dnd removed it with automod ( which i found kinda ironic , since the general quality of content over there is kinda terrible ) and / r/dndnext 's mods silently removed it after a few minutes . 
  nothing worse than silent moderation of non-botted spam , in my opinion . 
  / r/dndmemes seemed pretty receptive , though . 
   and devs are too reluctant to improve the core system, 
  yeah i found this pretty frustrating to be honest . 
  i suggested [ a fix to their automatic stats allocation algorithm ] ( https://github.com/habitrpg/habitica/issues/8172#issuecomment-256334437 ) , and even gave them near-complete code to use to do it . 
  their reasoning was basically `` we do n't want to use a better algorithm because we like the worse algorithm '' . 
  apparently / u/lefnire ( top mod on this subreddit , and one of the founders ) left them a while back . 
  i kinda suspect that 's when they stopped being so interested in truly improving the service . 
   personally , i 've found a good concept tends to build itself, 
  eh , i can see it going either way . 
  when i build a character , i usually do it pretty divorced from the mechanics . 
  i have a backstory , character motivations , personality , and a reason to go adventuring , but i do n't usually come up with a character in a way that points to certain mechanics . 
  ( edit : or if i do , it 's only * some * of those mechanics , and i might not have an idea what to do outside of that one particular decision . ), 
  for example , say i 'm building a warlock . 
  i 'll have a detailed explanation of who the pact is with , why i 'm forming the pact , what the patron wants to get out of it , as well as what my character was like before forming the pact . 
  but none of that points to which spells or invocations i should take , what feats might work , etc. 
  now , personally , i usually pick that stuff for myself anyway , but i could easily see someone who has that same specific idea for a character that i had asking a forum for advice . 
  not that you should have been downvoted for asking for that information -- small details might be useful to point to some choices over others . 
  but i can see how it could be considered irrelevant . 
  i 've never liked the stormwind fallacy . 
  not because it 's * wrong * , per se , but because it carries the implicit assumption that a character that 's unoptimised for roleplay reasons is doing it wrong , or at least that characters that are both optimised and have character behind them are somehow `` better '' . 
  they 're not . 
  and if you come up with character concept * first * , sometimes certain options that fall naturally out of that are going to be suboptimal . 
  and that 's * fine * . 
  anyway magic , what prompts you to share this years old copypasta now ? 
  i really hate rogues . 
  too much damn stabbing . 
  and rangers . 
  too many arrows . 
   iron is part of the cellular structure of all organic matter , so they should have advantage attacking a bear with shocking grasp, 
  well , no , because the spell very specifically says '' ** wearing armour ** made of metal '' . 
  has to be * worn * , and has to be * armour * . 
  so it 's not rules lawyering , it 's just being dumb . 
  ( like all the others . ), 
   take this r/dnd thread and follow it down for this weird powergaming witch hunt, 
  well , the player in question there is asking to eat their cake and have it too . 
  you want to play a dwarf , you get a slower speed . 
  that 's one of the downsides of being a dwarf . 
  this comment said it best :, 
   he wants to have the number 1 set of racial stats no matter what race he is playing as . 
  that 's the definition of power gaming . 
  and it 's not the healthy sort of power gaming . 
  it 's not working within the rules to create a concept that is both mechanically powerful and thematically interesting , it 's wanting to play the absolute most optimised possible character and flavour be damned . 
  actually , no , it 's worse than flavour be damned . 
  it 's trying to * pretend * to be interested in flavour , while actually just wanting to keep the optimal options . 
   you simply ca n't justify `` oh i want to be a 25 speed race but have the 35 speed race 's stats because roleplaying . '', 
  powergame all you want man , but do n't pretend you 're just trying to open up your roleplaying options while you 're doing it . 
   who cares about the fun dwarf monk concept ? 
  clearly they do, 
  no , clearly they * do n't * , because they 're not willing to take the drawbacks of being a short stocky race , which includes being a little slower . 
  my problem is n't uniqueness ( if anything , i have the opposite problem -- they 're * nearly * identical , but remembering the small differences between them is a pain -- either go all the way into uniqueness or keep the changes minimal , like maybe * just * the unique fortress units ) , it 's the number of different buildings you have to go through to do stuff . 
  blacksmith , university , market , monastery , plus the individual buildings like barracks , mills , and watch towers . 
  it 's a pain having to go through each building to find the one upgrade i want . 
  also having to deal with how farms work is an enormous pain . 
  that 's just needless busywork . 
   roleplaying is making decisions based on what your character would do , and having a back story/set of goals that push your character forward, 
  that 's all you needed to say . 
  that 's an almost dictionary-accurate definition . 
  the rest of it is fluff . 
  nice to have , and certainly can improve the experience , but not necessary . 
   choosing between a cool concept flavor wise and strong mechanics should n't be a choice , you should be able to have both . 
  no , you should n't . 
  not always , anyway . 
  a halfling barbarian simply * should n't * be as effective as a goliath one . 
  ditto for the goliath thief . 
  sometimes , the most interesting option is a suboptimal one , and that needs to be represented in mechanics as well as in flavour . 
  dwarven monk is somewhat playing against type , but if the mechanics do n't reflect that , then what 's the point ? 
  it 's taking what could be a cool concept and making it bland and generic . 
   not that i think taking your kid to work is evil , but it certainly should be approved by the employer first, 
  sounds fine , but uber is n't an employer . 
  they 've carefully set up how their business runs so that they * are n't * considered employers , which allows them to shirk the responsibilities they would have if they were an employer . 
  found this [ on stack exchange ] ( http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66831/origin-of-make-ends-meet ) :, 
   i have found several versions of its origin : you get to choose !, 
  none is confirmed . 
  the origin is from sailing ships with lots of masts . 
  some were attached by ropes that moved . 
  some were hung with ropes that were permanent . 
  when the lower ropes broke , the captain would tell the men to pull the ropes together , splice them to get the ends to meeet again , pull and tug on the canvas , so that the masts would be productive for sailing again . 
  make ends meet - budget tightly - the metaphor was originally to do with wearing a shorter ( tighter ) belt presumably because you have been frugal , and are eating less , your belt would more easily fasten . 
  it 's old enough that it has centuries ago become an idiom , a turn of phrase that we do n't usually stop to think about at all , though we understand immediately that to make ends meet is to have enough money to live on . 
  the oldest example i can find is from thomas fuller 's the history of the worthies of england of about 1661 : `` worldly wealth he cared not for , desiring only to make both ends meet ; and as for that little that lapped over he gave it to pious uses '' , but the fact that fuller is making a little joke using it suggests he already knew of it as a set phrase . 
  where it comes from is hard to be sure about . 
  it 's often said that it 's from bookkeeping , in which the total at the bottom ( `` end '' ) of the column of income must at least match that at the bottom of the expenditure column if one is not to be living beyond one 's income . 
  the phrase is also known in the form to make both ends of the year meet , which might strengthen that connection if we think of the usual end-of-year accounting , except that that form is n't the original one and was n't recorded until tobias smollett used it in roderick random in 1748 . 
   i would go with 1 or 2 . 
  but yeah , apparently has nothing to do with meat . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` prestige '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  based on the fact that it only has 5 levels and gets no saving throw proficiencies , i 'm assuming it 's a prestige class . 
  but since it 's also lacking multiclass requirements ( such as minimum level and stats ) , i might be overpresumptuous .
