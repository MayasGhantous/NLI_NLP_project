  and that 's fine ; not everyone can be expected to know all the jargon in every technical field . 
  i hope i 've cleared things up now . 
  and , by the way , i 'll just point out that i never called * you * a moron . 
  i said your specific ** idea ** was moronic . 
  that 's a * huge * difference . 
  you , on the other hand , are attacking me directly . 
  and that 's just not on . 
  really ? 
  you do n't ? 
  to start with , neither of the others have big fancy trailers , or their own unique domain with `` dnd '' in the name . 
  both of the others make it very clear that this is d&d working * with * these tools . 
  it says `` dungeons & dragons ** on ** roll20 '' ( emphasis mine ) . 
  the fantasy grounds one does n't even put d&d in the title . 
  instead , the * description * says `` d&d content ... pre-loaded into fantasy grounds as optional add-ons '' . 
  that 's pretty clear . 
  and neither of them , * anywhere * in the announcement , use the dragon ampersand . 
  they both make it extremely clear : `` this is a third party utility that you can now access d&d content in ! '', 
   you specifically did direct your comments at me, 
  no , i directed my comments at your * statements * . 
  i was arguing against what you * said * , not against you as a person . 
   ** the comment ** you replied to is just laughably ignorant, 
  with, 
   it seems to me that ** if you had so little experience ** with the internet as to assume you do n't need to authenticate for paid-for things , you would n't also get bent out of shape about who you were authenticating against, 
  very different . 
  mine was pointing out the specific claim that you made which was wrong . 
   you 're attempting to shift the goalposts to terminology, 
  no goalpost shifting . 
  my entire point was that you claimed quite clearly that twitch was not `` a separate service '' from beyond . 
  it * is * a separate service . 
   your view would reframe the whole thing as ' i do not want d&d tools if the company also runs a streaming service ' . 
  to call this a straw man is to do a disservice to straw men . 
  my view is that i do not want d&d tools which require me to log in to a streaming service that i do n't already use . 
  twitch is a pretty niche website compared to , say , google or facebook . 
  i do n't have an account ( that i can use ) , and i do n't think anyone in my d&d group does either . 
  if it required google , i would n't be complaining . 
  if it was owned by twitch ( which is owned by amazon -- so why are n't they using that ? ), 
  but used its own unique log in , i would n't be complaining . 
  because i use and like and trust google . 
  none of those words apply to twitch for me . 
  and i do n't like having to make an account on twitch to use an ultimately unrelated service , especially one that is primarily being marketed as a d&d product . 
  there 's a * huge * difference between attacking someone 's * arguments * and attacking them as a * person * , ba . 
  only one of us is engaging in the latter . 
  and i wo n't . 
  what 's most annoying , though , is that i have no proper way to even * tell them * that i 'm not signing up , since even the * forum * requires logging in with twitch to use . 
  that 's why i 'm asking the kind people of reddit who * do * feel happy to log in with twitch to leave a comment on behalf of me and all the other people who do n't . 
   if it said `` login with facebook '' `` login with google '' `` login with hotmail '', 
  if it were google , i would sign up happily in a heartbeat . 
  if it were facebook , i 'd probably grunge about it for a few minutes before signing up . 
  ^ ( if it were hotmail i 'd laugh and roll my eyes , before trying to figure out what my old hotmail address was . ), 
  why ? 
  because i use these all the time . 
  i know them and am comfortable with them . 
  twitch is a service i never use , and i honestly do n't even * like * . 
  and because of that , i do n't like the idea of needing an account on this completely unrelated service in order to be able to use a d&d product . 
  i 'm a bit iffy about facebook because i do n't particularly trust them with information if i can avoid it , but like most people , i find it hard to completely avoid it anyway . 
  if it 's an account i have and use already * anyway * , then i do n't mind integrating other stuff with it . 
  but having a third party account to connect to a service , when i do n't use the third party thing itself , is a pain that i do n't want to deal with . 
  it 's a bait and switch because most people have never heard of curse before and will have no idea that they 're owned by twitch . 
  but more importantly , this is being marketed primarily as a d&d product . 
  not as a twitch product that 's allowed to use d&d ip . 
  that sets it a long way apart from the roll20 and fantasy grounds integrations , which were advertised to us as * integrations * . 
  as for the google stuff , see my reply to the other guy . 
  because it * was * . 
  it was a very simple and clear statement that was so completely far from the truth . 
  may as well have said `` 2 +2 = 5 '' , it was that bizarre . 
  it was only that one specific statement that i took aim at . 
  not * him * , and not anything else he said . 
  the difference between that and very specifically taking aim at another * person * is enormous and , philosophically , * very * important . 
  maybe i went too far in my specific wording , and for that i apologise , but it does n't change the fact that he attacked * me * , i attacked his * claims * . 
   victoria makes motorcyclists pay a motorcycle levy to improve initiatives promoting rider safety . 
  why not for bikes ? 
  simple . 
  more cyclists is a good thing . 
  it means a healthier populous , less pollution , less traffic for those who do drive , less wear on roads , etc. 
  cycling is also a good option for people who ca n't afford the costs associated with a car . 
  a levy on cyclists would make it harder for people to cycle . 
  that would reduce the number of cyclists on the road , decreasing both the public and personal good done by having more cyclists . 
  but more than that , it would be really hard to do . 
  motorbikes already need to have a number plate , have and carry a license , etc. 
  cyclists do n't do these things , and it would be stupid to try and impose these things because , again , it would reduce the number of cyclists on the road . 
  and without this system in place , any levy would be unenforceable . 
  so it ends up being a terrible idea in theory , and even if you did implement it , it would be impossible to enforce . 
  i saw / r/drizzy in the trending subreddits and thought `` oh , this is relevant today , it 's been raining on and off all day here ! '', 
  then i realised the subreddit was not about weather , and i was disappointed . 
  then i realised the word i was thinking of was drizz ** l ** y ... 
  yeah i have to agree . 
  the episode wanted to paint j'onn as being in the wrong , and alex in the right , when clearly it should have been the other way around . 
   we do n't really need this sub now as much as we did last year do we ? 
  maybe not * as * much , but this place is still much , * much * better than the other subs , so we definitely still need it . 
  thanks so much for providing it , and keeping it sane !, 
  my one word of criticism , though , relates to the episode discussion threads . 
  they become cluttered up very early with long rambly comments that seem just to be a blow-by-blow of what happened in the episode , with minimal effort commentary . 
  i 'd rather that kind of stuff stayed in the low-effort subs , and we kept the discussion threads on this sub for actual * discussion * . 
  more of [ this ] ( / r/cwarrow/comments / 5zfwd0/the _ flash_s3e16_into_the_speed_force_episode / deydj49 / ) and [ this ] ( / r/cwarrow/comments / 5zfwd0/the _ flash_s3e16_into_the_speed_force_episode / dey545p / ) , less of [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cwarrow/comments/5zfwd0/the_flash_s3e16_into_the_speed_force_episode/dexsitd/ ) and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cwarrow/comments/5zfwd0/the_flash_s3e16_into_the_speed_force_episode/dexsgux/ ) , basically . 
   the play-by-plays happen in other subs but they just make more than 1 post about it, 
  yeah , but they also happen in a live watching thread , not a post-episode discussion thread like we have here . 
  i specifically avoid those threads too because i do n't care to see someone 's play-by-play -- i 've already just seen the episode too . 
  but i guess if you find them useful for your excellent discussion comments , then they 're a net good . 
  does n't work in macos with chrome . 
  so must be firefox + macos .
