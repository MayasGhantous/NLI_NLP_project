  the grave is a set of thematic material of its own that reappears throughout the movement . 
  that said , i 'd still say `` second group '' is probably the best way to refer to the material in the picture . 
  but in this case op 's picture is neither nsfw nor nsfl , it 's a perfectly safe picture . 
  i 'm amazed at the internet community 's apparent obsession with zimmer . 
  compared to all those that you mentioned he 's absolutely nothing . 
  his scores are interesting , but hardly what you 'd call fantastic in the way williams is . 
  zimmer 's best and most memorable score , pirates of the caribbean , is one that he did n't even write the themes to !, 
  i want to pick a favourite , but i just ca n't . 
  debussy and satie were particularly funny , but also seemed really accurate . 
  holst made me sad , because it 's unfortunate but true . 
  beethoven was accurate along the same lines as debussy and satie , but more literal . 
  it was also not quite as funny . 
  i must say i do n't understand the mozart one 's reference , unless it 's a meta-effect about this entire thread . 
  do i detect some hostility towards rachmaninov ? 
  ah , right . 
  he was saying the book makes the generalisations , not mozart does , right ? 
  cheers, 
  yeah , but something about that one seemed particularly pointed , i ca n't explain why . 
  yeah , it is unorthodox . 
  i 'm currently working on this exact piece ( nearly finished with the first movement , second movement i 've done already , barely done anything on the third yet ) , and i do n't know whether i prefer repeating from the beginning or from the first allegro . 
  the composer 's manuscript is lost , but the first edition we have puts the repeat sign at the allegro , which is why that 's the common practice . 
  andras schiff gives a really good justification of it [ in this lecture ] ( http://download.guardian.co.uk/sys-audio/arts/culture/2006/11/09/pathetique.mp3 ) ( he also prefers to repeat from the beginning ) . 
  ( he 's actually done [ one on every beethoven sonata ] ( http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) , if you 're interested . ), 
  your idea of `` an announcement '' is certainly an interesting one , thanks for that . 
  the feeling is mutual ( at least on my part ! ), 
  haha i loved the mahler one !, 
  i thought that was hilarious . 
  in fact , it probably should have gone up there with debussy and satie , i just somehow missed it !, 
  oh damn , not again ... second time i 've made this exact mistake on this subreddit ... 
  so sorry ma'am . 
  just a tip for future reference , the wording you 're looking for is `` 5 percentage points '' higher . 
  [ yep , it 's public domain ] ( http://imslp.org/wiki/the_tale_of_tsar_saltan_ ( opera ) _ ( rimsky-korsakov , _ nikolay ) ) . 
  i would title it `` flight of the bumblebee in bb for bb clarinet by __ '' . 
  use your real name if you want , but if you 'd rather stay private use a pseudonym . 
  yes , pdf is the best file format , and if you want to make it greet available to as many people as possible submit it as an `` arrangement or transcription '' on imslp . 
  you could also use scribd or some other site . 
  just search `` pdf hosts '' . 
  edit : the link does n't work .

  that said , nothing beats a good [ celeste ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsx9ndwbd_w ) !, 
  yeah i agree . 
  i think he may have been referring to the weird little wave she does after the first rock as she sets up for the second shot . 
  it looked strange , but personally i had no problems with it . 
  the actual footwork and her arm movements in the attacks are fine . 
  this is n't nsfw in any way , shape , or form . 
  i got my first phone at 13 . 
  i 'm 18 now and i 'm just about to get my second phone . 
  the first was a sony ericson `` j '' series . 
  they 're as dumb as they can possibly get . 
  you should be using an antivirus . 
  grab microsoft security essentials . 
  it 's free , works well , and keeps out of your way . 
  it even has a pretty decent interface , to boot !, 
  no because 9gag , as in , 9 people gag . 
  a coupla suggestions :, 
  * make it clear where the concert would take place . 
  at the moment i ca n't even tell for certain the country , though i assume uk because if pounds . 
  pre-post edit : ok i found it in the corner there , but i 'd still recommend editing it in to the description . 
  i ca n't be the only one too stupid to miss it . 
  * try to arrange a high quality recording of it and offer digital copies to backers . 
  many people who might otherwise be interested may not back because they ca n't get anything out of it for themselves . 
  ( maybe make it a stretch goal : say that you will do this if the project makes # 500 or something . ), 
  * related , perhaps post a recording of any precious conducting these same conductor 's have done , i its available . 
  people are hesitant to back projects without evidence the result will be good . 
  by the way , i 'm really curious how # 300 is going to be enough to pay for all the logistics , especially venue hire and music , but i guess you 've probably done the research already . 
  i 'm guessing all musicians must be volunteers . 
  best of luck with this , nonetheless !, 
  nope , it 's not irony . 
  in fact , it 's the opposite of irony . 
  oooh !, 
  i also ( used to ) live in korea ( \ubd80\uc0b0 ) . 
  it seems as though op is going to deduce from the results that people who use computers more are more likely to use glasses , but without any factoring in * why * they need glasses i ca n't see how this works . 
  i suppose a simple 2-prop z test where h ^ 1 : p ^ 1  p ^ 2 ( and h ^ 0 : p ^ 1 = p ^ 2 , obviously ) could account for that . 
  i mean , if the number of people using computers a lot who need glasses is significantly greater than the number of people who * do n't * use computers a lot need glasses it 's probably fairly safe to assume it 's * because of * the computer use . 
  depends on how large and how varied the sample size is , of course . 
  \\* note : all those superscripts really should be subscript, 
  huh ? 
  that seems like a gross overestimate . 
  the conversion to kilogrammes is 2.2 , right ? 
  that means you 're claiming the average weight of humans today is about 81kg , which i find really hard to believe ... 
  to be fair , the un 's voice is only,
