  i got banned for my comment . 
  everyone here is talking about cricket as the culprit . 
  have you guys even read the article ? 
  it quite clearly lays the fault at the feet of the adele concert , which wrecked the grass and meant it had to be re-turfed . 
  cricket was n't mentioned * once * . 
   and as much fun as this was , all it was was a way for them to tie a neat bow and fix their relationship drama for two shows, 
  fixing the relationship drama that was largely * put there * to be fixed by this episode . 
  they would n't have even needed to fix it in this episode if they had just not put it there . 
  anyway , i thought the amount of singing was fine . 
  three original songs \\* , plus moon river at the start . 
  that 's an average of one every 10 minutes , which is fine . 
  too much more and it 'd start getting overly cheesy . 
  \\* at least , as far as i could tell . 
  the gangster dads ' song and the super friend song i 'm assuming were original , and the running home to you one i * thought * might have been a real existing song , but googling the lyrics came up with nothing except references to this episode . 
  i 'll ask you the same question i asked / u/audigex , but got no answer . 
  where 's the hate ? 
  i looked through the comments on the front page and saw a lot of constructive criticism and a little unjustified ( in the sense that there was no provided justification , not in the sense that it was undeserved ) praise . 
  exactly * zero * unconstructive criticism . 
  tanya i think i vaguely understand , and adelaide street i get . 
  but i have * no * idea what `` asian prostitute '' is meant to be referring to . 
  i had completely forgotten about that . 
  i hope the dude 's okay ... 
  it 's difficult to judge abilities in the abstract . 
  giving them sneak attack is a bad idea because it 's ripped straight from an existing class . 
  it 's okay if you have something similar , but if it 's exactly the same without the finesse restriction , that 's not okay . 
  most of the other abilities seem like they could probably be okay in principle if they are carefully written up and adjusted to be level appropriate for a prestige class . 
  but without seeing exactly how that was done , i ca n't say for sure . 
  you may also like to take a look at [ this prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) for more inspiration on how to design it . 
  it 's not only the best example of a prestige class the homebrew community has come up with , it 's quite possibly one of the best pieces of homebrew out there full stop . 
  backspace to go back * needed * to go . 
  i 'm sure some tiny number of people used it intentionally . 
  far , ** far ** more frequently , people who thought they were typing but had accidentally not selected/deselected the text box ended up getting accidentally sent back through their history and losing whatever progress they * had * made filling in text boxes on the current page . 
  i have no problems , per se , with them removing this current feature , either . 
  i 've never used it , and i ca n't even understand why one * would * use it . 
  what 's the use case for closing all tabs but the current one ? 
  and even if that is something you want , there are plethora other ways of doing it . 
  selecting a range of tabs and ctrl/cmd-w has been mentioned in this thread as an alternative , as has dragging the tab into its own window and closing the old window . 
  but it 's also a * harmless * feature . 
  no one 's going to invoke it by accident . 
  so i would n't strongly argue that they 've made the * right * decision by removing that feature , either . 
  i 'm pretty neutral on this one . 
  keep it in an incognito window . 
  close the whole window with * one * click . 
  much more convenient . 
  or , if you 'd rather keep it in your browser history , keep it in a secondary normal window and close that . 
  either way , this feature is a suboptimal way of achieving what you want . 
  it 's not lenient or malformed syntax . 
  markdown is n't html . 
  the syntax for markdown requires * two * tokens in order to parse as italic . 
  if one is escaped , the other does n't need to be not because of an html-like leniency towards poor syntax , but because without a matching pair markdown does n't treat it as a syntactical token . 
  that said , putting in a backslash on the second underscore_still is n't a bad idea , just in case you have another one somewhere in the paragraph . 
  huh fair enough . 
  still two original songs then as far as i can tell . 
  oh right . 
  yeah , that use case makes sense . 
  to be honest , i forgot all about the `` close tabs to the right '' option . 
  i still do n't really see a significant valid use case for `` close all other tabs '' though . 
   so instead of limiting metamagic to sorcerers , we have created a system where metamagic options are available to all arcane casters, 
  what have you given sorcerers to compensate for this ? 
  yeah , with no history of publicly posting stuff for review ( e.g. , on / r/unearthedarcana ) , there 's absolutely no way i 'd be willing to trust any of this , especially with such a large quantity of new player options .

  wait , you actually * spin * off walls ? 
  it 's not just a pure reflection about the norm of the wall and your angle of incidence ? 
  how have i never noticed this, 
  rules as written , thrown weapons have to be drawn before they can be thrown , and drawing them * does n't * come as part of the attack . 
  this is in contrast to ammunition-based ranged weapons like bows and crossbows , where drawing the ammunition is included as part of the action . 
  you can draw one weapon for free each turn , so you could already be holding two , throw both of them , and then draw and throw a third . 
  if you 've prepared in advance , you could also set it up so that you 're * already * holding more than two . 
  like having three darts in your off hand , plus one in your throwing hand . 
  might not be as feasible to do this with axes as it is with darts , though . 
  personally , i 've never had it come up . 
  but as a dm , i would probably be willing to lift the restriction if a player asked me to , and let thrown weapons work the same way ammunition weapons do . 
  it lets them get their cool character concept in , and i really ca n't see it messing with balance at all . 
  that would be a house rule though , and not part of rules as written * or * intended .

  you a blue bagger ? 
  i ca n't agree . 
  unless you and i have a specific pre agreed reason that i would share my location with you , i 'm * always * going to decline . 
  it 's the default position , to me . 
  how would a purely reflexive response like that cause any rational person to suspect something amiss ? 
   the census considers people born in the middle east as white, 
  i do n't know what crazy country you live in , but mine certainly does n't . 
  i do n't really know how it started , but there 's recently been a meme on the subreddit of photos of adelaide street . 
  go back through the history a week or so and there are probably a dozen or so posts about it . 
  this thread might help : / r/brisbane/comments / 60f3rd/out _ of_the_loop_adelaide_street /, 
  ah , right . 
  that kinda explains it . 
  you linked to a really , really old version of / u/the _ singular_anyone 's stronghold building rules . 
  [ here is a more recent one ] ( http://walrock-homebrew.blogspot.com.au/2017/03/worldbuilding-option-fortresses-temples.html ) . 
  also , [ here is an expansion to that ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 5uphft/wh _ strongholds_traders_merchants_expanded / ) with traders and merchants . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !,
