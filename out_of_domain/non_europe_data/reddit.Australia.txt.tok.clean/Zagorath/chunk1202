  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support either . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  looks like we have to update our automod config . 
  our bad . 
  but yeah , in the future , if the flair does n't get applied automatically for any reason , always remember to do it manually . 
  i do n't know about series , but definitely the strongest one this season , and very high up there for the whole show . 
  absolutely fantastic episode . 
  definitely best this season , and one of the top 10 at least for the whole show . 
  i 'm still not sold on prometheus 's motivations as a villain , but i am * finally * sold on him as a villain in the broader sense . 
  he feels genuinely threatening and powerful , and not like some lame grimdark weirdo like he 's always felt to me in the past . 
  but this made him * incredibly * real . 
  the flashbacks were possibly the best in terms of being integrated to the story since season 2 , and made an awesome story in their own right . 
  really great . 
  my biggest criticism with the episode is probably felicity 's technobabble at the end . 
  i mean , it 's always really terrible , but for some reason this one stood out to me as particularly bad . 
  maybe because it happened so close to the end of the episode ? 
  like constantine , perhaps , but without another universe to come along and save it . 
  they 've established too many other superheroes and villains for it to be able to squeeze in to the arrowverse . 
  is this show bad ? 
  eh , maybe . 
  but it 's head and shoulders ahead of the absolutely fucking terrible piece of crap that is legends of tomorrow . 
  good point . 
  not sure why i did n't think of that ... 
  i suspect it 's still unlikely since dc seems not to want to let the arrowverse have anything more than really vague hints at bateman 's existence . 
  but maybe they 're loosening up on that . 
  look at the key signatures . 
  does n't look like a valid composition . 
  the first complete system we can see has the solo part in b flat ( or gm , i ca n't be bothered analysing which ) , and the piano part in f ( or dm ) . 
  the second system has , without any clear cue to change anything unusual , the solo part and the right hand of piano in bb , and the left hand of the piano in c. 
  the first system would be possible if the solo part is an instrument in g ( hard to think of which it would be , there need to be three of them mostly in the alto to soprano range -- maybe three alto flutes ) , but outside of some * really * weird 20th century rule breaking , the second system is simply not possible . 
  my best guess is it 's been mostly randomly made especially for the show . 
  edit : four . 
  you 'd need at least four instruments to play the solo part . 
  could you explain your choice of title ? 
   there 's no `` co '' about the responsibility that 's taken on . 
  a co-signer is on the hook to the same degree that `` signer '' is . 
  that is precisely what `` co - '' means , so ... yeah . 
  count me in on this as well . 
  the lore you should know segments are fantastic , and sage advice segments in the podcast are infinitely more valuable than the written articles ( which tend just to be `` here 's the rules from the book , restated because you could n't be bothered to read them the first time '' ) with the in-depth explanations of * why * they did things how they did . 
  the stuff on upcoming books is nice but i can take it or leave it . 
  the interviews with random people i 've mostly never heard of before are dull and skippable . 
  i think it 's probably worth noting that australia has done a much , * much * better job of integrating cultures than america . 
  for the most part , people identify as just `` australian '' , regardless of where they 're from . 
  you 're much less likely to hear someone identify themselves as `` italian-australian '' than you would `` italian-american '' , especially if they 're third gen or younger . 
  this is less true for asians than europeans , but there 's still much more of a feeling that one 's identity is australian more so than ____ - australian . 
  as for the `` treaded badly '' bit , i believe this was historically true . 
  i 've never seen any modern day signs of it myself , but i 've heard that there were some negative feelings towards italians in the '50s and '60s or so . 
  umm . 
  sea lions are a real thing , you know . 
  make it a `` pull '' sign for even greater effect , since the design of the door is such that they 're going to have a hard time figuring out how to grab it in order to pull . 
  it 's got an incredible amount of built-in flavour with the patron . 
  who is the patron ? 
  why did you form a pact with them ? 
  why did * they * form a pact with * you * ? 
  how does everyone around you feel about you making this deal , including other party members , random npcs , etc. ? 
  there 's just such an incredible amount of background detail required to properly play a warlock , and it 's what makes them so great . 
  plus , mechanically , they 're one of the most flexible in terms of how you build them . 
  you choose cantrips , spells , a pact , a patron , and invocations ( in addition to the obvious ones everyone gets , like stats and feats ) . 
  so many different , discrete * types * of choices to make that are all meaningful and impact how you play . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` adventure '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  this would * greatly * benefit from a table of contents . 
  [ i redid it with one included if anyone wants it . 
  ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/h13_pcfhx ), 
  horn in f transposes one key * sharper * . 
  the horn 's g is concert c ( and horn 's c is concert f ) . 
  what we 're seeing in the first system here is one key * flatter * . 
  so it 's an instrument pitched in g , like the alto flute . 
  and it needs to be at least 4 parts , not just two . 
  but then the piano changes so its right hand is in the same key as the solo part . 
  which throws off * any * rational explanation . 
   it 's been awhile since i played saxophone ( bflat ), 
  tenor , i assume ? 
  or possibly soprano ? 
  but anyway , yeah , my main instrument is clarinet ( bb ) , but i also dabble in sax ( alto -- eb ) . 
  remembering that my parts are always two keys * sharper * is basically the only way i can remember which way things transpose in other keys . 
  and again , it ca n't be a duet . 
  the solo part * frequently * has three parts at once , and there are a couple of moments that seem to have four notes at once . 
  so best case scenario , it 's a quartet + piano . 
  but even then , the way it 's notated does n't make a whole lot of sense , which leaves me to believe it 's most likely just made up . 
  huh . 
  well . 
  that 's a thing , i guess . 
  someone else posted a picture of the table of contents . 
  apparently it includes a creature called a `` sea lion '' , which has been in d&d in the past and is * not * necessarily the same as the real animal related to seals . 
  could you post a photo of the included artwork of a sea lion if there is one , and if not , just give us an idea of whether it 's an [ actual sea lion ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/california_sea_lion_in_la_jolla_%2870568%29.jpg/250px-california_sea_lion_in_la_jolla_%2870568%29.jpg ) or a [ fantasy sea lion ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/d%26dsea_lion.jpg/200px-d%26dsea_lion.jpg ) ? 
  i had the same problem . 
  but i went and made my own copy of the document , so i could add a table of contents to the top . 
  while i was at it , i figured i 'd also format it to use the standard a4 page size . 
  that seems to have fixed the problem for me . 
  every page is displaying correctly in all views . 
  [ here 's a link to the copy ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/h13_pcfhx ) . 
  out of interest , / u/stolksdorf , are you familiar with the problem dminyadms was having ? 
  it displays * fine * in the share mode , but goes weird when clicking get pdf . 
  [ here 's a screenshot of the problem ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jl9bgvg.png ) , and even changing the paper size [ does n't work ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sunmxrf.png ) . 
  you should n't allow strength intimidation if they 're trying to talk to the person and make them scared . 
  strength ( intimidation ) rolls are for if they 're doing something to * show * how physically threatening they are . 
  imagine the barbarian snapping a guard 's spear in two using nothing but his hands , and that scaring the guard into letting him in to the city . 
  that sort of thing . 
   you know how 50 % of house episodes involve a disease or issue that would 've been found immediately if the doctors made a full examination of the patient 's body , but instead it 's repeatedly missed because they use these super high tech machines like the mri and pet scan ? 
  huh ?
