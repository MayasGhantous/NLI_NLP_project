   i have to repost with a screenshot because naturalcrit was having some wonky formatting issuses . 
  it really was n't . 
  you just put in a column break where one did n't make sense . 
  you just needed to remove the column break , and add some blank vertical space , and it would have worked fine . 
  this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of thing . 
  there 's / r/supergirl for stuff about supergirl but not the show , and probably other stuff for justice league related stuff . 
  this sub is for stuff about the supergirl tv show that 's part of the arrowverse . 
   it put the title on one side with the text on the other, 
  that 's what the blank vertical space fixes . 
  if you change it to this :, 
  possess more deadly or permanently detrimental spell scrolls . 
   * medium construct , unaligned *, 
   - ** hit points ** 84 ( 13d8 +26 ), 
   - ** speed ** 0ft. , fly 30ft . 
  it should display fine . 
  at least , it does for me . 
  or , alternatively ,, 
  possess more deadly or permanently detrimental spell scrolls . 
   * medium construct , unaligned *, 
   - ** hit points ** 84 ( 13d8 +26 ), 
   - ** speed ** 0ft. , fly 30ft . 
  should also work . 
  note that you ca n't just hit enter a bunch of times , because markdown and html * both * ignore extraneous whitespace . 
  instead , you need to either explicitly put a bunch of blank space in ( the first example ) , or tell it `` i want a line here with nothing in it except a pace , and i want a bunch of those lines '' , like in the second example . 
  you 've got `` another point buy system '' , but not `` another rolling system '' . 
  my system is `` 4d6 drop lowest , one array '' ( which is what i answered in the poll ) , but with a normalising factor : if your stats are too good you have to reroll , if they 're too bad , you 're allowed to reroll . 
  generally , if your total modifier is less than +2 or more than +5 , rerolls occur , but with a little leeway depending on precisely how they 're distributed . 
   there are a lot of very very powerful options, 
  and also a lot of ridiculously underpowered options , too . 
  nobody would ever want to play an orc rather than the phb 's half-orc ( and just reskin it as a full orc , if that 's what you want ) , which is clearly superior . 
  it means you can still have that fun of potentially getting an 18 , and the risk of getting a 6 or lower , but that your * overall * stats are going to be fairly balanced . 
  so one player might get an 18 , a 6 , and some scores between 10 and 15 , while another player gets one 14 , two 10s , and the rest are 12 . 
  there 's a lot of variety possible , but it means that nobody feels left out because they got shitty scores while someone else got an 18 and two 16s . 
  so , should those of us outside america call it `` minnesoft drink '' ? 
  my system is `` 4d6 drop lowest , one array '' ( which is what i answered in the poll ) , but with a normalising factor : if your stats are too good you have to reroll , if they 're too bad , you 're allowed to reroll .

  it gets you the best of both worlds . 
  every player is roughly equally powerful like point buy , and you get both the fun and the unpredictable distribution of stats from rolling . 
  i do now . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find a high quality image of it , but my favourite title sheet has to be [ beethoven 's autograph score for his third symphony ] ( https://virginiaburges.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/beethoven-eroica-_title.jpg ) . 
  it 's not the prettiest , perhaps , but it * definitely * has the coolest story behind it . 
  that 's actually quite an interesting idea . 
  but i think if i were to do it , i 'd probably say take the middle from 3d20 . 
  you 'd see a lot of 9s -- 12s , a few 5 -- 8s and 13 -- 16s , and a small number of 17 + or 4 -- . 
  it 'd make for a much lower powered campaign than 4d6d1 , which itself is a lower powered campaign than 2d20d1 . 
  2d20d1 is going to make for some absolute super-powered heroes , while 4d6d1 could be described as generating your typical heroic adventure , and 3d20-middle1 gives you a campaign where people feel mostly grounded but highly varied -- so more people who are very good at one thing and very bad at another -- as opposed to 3d6 , which gives mostly grounded with low variation -- and everyone 's pretty equal with only rare exceptions . 
  fixed array leads to boring characters . 
  everyone has one of maybe two different distributions . 
  when you randomise it , but follow these guidelines , everyone ends up roughly equally powerful ( and , incidentally , roughly equal to the standard array as well , since it has a +5 overall score ) , but * different * . 
  one person might be highly specialised in one thing and flat otherwise , one person might be strong in two areas but have a particularly bad weakness , and another might be a jack of all trades . 
  that 's just not a variety i ever see in point buy . 
  point buy is always `` one or two 16s ( after racial modifiers ) , and something approximating standard array other than that '' . 
   then do point buy, 
  that 's what i was referring to . 
  i just used the terminology from your previous comment . 
   add more points if you want, 
  does n't help . 
  i 'm not after a higher power level , just more interesting characters . 
   do n't do random if you have guidelines that remove the randomness, 
  first of all , do n't tell me what to do . 
  second of all , actually * read * and try to * comprehend * what i 'm saying . 
  randomness has benefits , which i quite clearly laid out in the previous comment . 
  but it also has drawbacks , if unchecked ; it can lead to some characters vastly outshining others and taking away their fun . 
  by rolling randomly within a certain range , you get the benefits of both , and the drawbacks of neither . 
   it sounds like you should just come up with a list of fixed arrays that are all equal, 
  i 've considered this in the past . 
  i came up with a random table ranging from 15 , 15 , 15 , 8 , 8 , 8 ( or whatever the valid point buy with three 15s is ) , to 12 , 12 , 12 , 10 , 10 , 10 ( again , or whatever the nearest to that with point buy is ) , with a total of 6 different options . 
  i think the standard array lay at around 3 or 4 . 
  it achieves mostly the same effect as what i was going for , with a couple of drawbacks . 
  firstly , and most importantly , rolling 1d6 to decide which array you get is way , way less fun than going through the 4d6d1 process . 
  also important is the possibility of getting a score less than 8 or more than 15 , which is not possible using point buy , and therefore does n't come up in a table of a bunch of point buy options . 
  and yes , you could come up with rules in point buy to allow for that , but it would be a lot of work , and especially allowing values * less than 8 * would require a complete overhaul of the point buy system . 
  and that seems like a whole lot more effort than it 's worth just to approximate the features already easily built in to a simple bounded roll system . 
   i 'm simply suggesting alternatives to doing random and ironing out the randomness, 
  that 's exactly the problem . 
  you 're telling me i should be doing something which completely defeats the purpose . 
  you 're also telling me i do n't want what i explicitly do want . 
  if you do n't have that random element , you get samey characters . 
  that 's been my experience , and it 's what makes sense logically . 
  even if you 're not a min/maxer , there 's a certain degree of feeling like it 's necessary to build a character in this way if you 're point buying . 
  if you roll for it , that feeling goes away completely , and you can just play a cool character . 
  it feels like the character has evolved organically , rather than being one you explicitly created to be perfectly good at the specific things you want . 
  that 's the primary benefit of rolling : it 's less gamist , and is more suitable for the high immersion style of game where you really get in to a character 's head , which is the type of game i prefer . 
  point buy is fine , but it 's more ideal if you 're dungeon crawling or less invested in the * character * of your pc . 
   you are getting upset , downvoting me, 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  or at least , if it 's not you , it 's people who agree with you , and it does n't make much difference to me which that is , just like if i were to tell you it 's not me downvoting you , i 'm sure you would n't care much for that excuse . 
  especially when my comments are doing nothing more than stating my opinion and why i believe it is superior , where as you are repeatedly attacking me by claiming to know my own thoughts better than i do . 
  bottom line , and frankly i 'm not going to continue this conversation any further because i 'm basically making the same point over and over again , i like random generation because it makes characters feel more varied and interesting , but i also like balanced games , and so the randomness needs to be reined in a little . 
  that does n't , despite your protestations , make point buy an adequate ( let alone superior ) solution to my problem . 
  ninja edit : huh . 
  at the time i started typing this comment , all my above comments were in the negative , while yours were all positive or at 0 . 
  now only the first one of mine is negative , and many of yours are . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  also consider looking at / r/dndhomebrew to see if your request has an answer there . 
  best of luck . 
   not sure how to add footers for homebrewery, 
  add that to the bottom of the page , right before the ` \\ page ` command .
