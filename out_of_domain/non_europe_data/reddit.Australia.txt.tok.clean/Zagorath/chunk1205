  unfortunately there 's no way ( that i know of ) to have an automatic footer that gets applied to every page . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` resource '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   legal, 
  sure . 
   i love the ff , as if they might accidentally play the canon in pp . 
  amusingly , in the second volley he asks for ffff . 
  i 'm not sure that you can really change * the volume of a canon , petyr mate . 
  but thanks for letting us know . 
  i do love that tchaikovsky was like `` okay orchestra , i know ff means very loud , but i now want you guys playing as loud as you can ( fff ) '' , and then a little while later he 's like `` okay , i know you 're going as loud as you can , but i need you to be ** even louder ** ( ffff ) '' . 
   also the fact he gave it pitch is interesting rather that the ` x ' percussion note . 
  not really . 
  look at all the other unpitched percussion . 
  the bass drum , the snare , the bells . 
  they 're notated in the same way . 
  it 's just a style of writing . 
  might have been before someone had the idea to write using a single line staff , or using the x notehead . 
  edit : stupid autocorrect changed `` change '' to `` cary '' . 
  wtf, 
  because rolling within bounds gets you the best of both worlds . 
  the disadvantage of pure rolling is that some characters can outshine others , leaving the weaker ones feeling inadequate and purposeless . 
  the disadvantage of point buy is that it feels gamist , encourages min/maxing , and results in basically two different stat distributions : one or two 16s ( after racials ) and something approximating the standard array otherwise . 
  i 've never seen someone who is a true jack of all trades , master of none ; i 've never seen someone who 's maxed out in three stats but incompetent at the other three . 
  it also has the disadvantage of never getting scores less than 8 or more than 15 . 
  so you can ** never ** have someone who 's * really * bad at something and particularly good at something else . 
  hedging like this lets you get rid of the disadvantages of both systems , while keeping the advantages . 
  you get the excitement of rolling your stats . 
  the character gets to feel more organic and less an artificial creation . 
  you see more variety in characters ' stat distributions . 
  all this , while still having every character be on roughly the same power level . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  what is a single-world joiner ? 
  what , are save attempts probabilistic ? 
  like , if you join a game and your team is behind , the server randomly decides if it counts as a save attempt or not ? 
  why does n't it just always count as a save attempt ? 
   as long as a ) you do n't mess up the cap, 
  this is the problem . 
  it 's worth getting angry at people for showboating precisely because of the chance that they end up losing the cap . 
  i have two main problems with these . 
  the first is the rhyming . 
  it 's pretty bad . 
  a lot of these are `` weak '' or `` syllabic '' rhymes , whereas the best riddles use perfect , oblique , or imperfect rhymes . 
  ( i 'm using the terminology from [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhyme#types_of_rhyme ) , fwiw . ), 
  weak and syllabic rhymes just do n't sound very good . 
  `` jealous '' and `` fabulous '' do n't work well , and neither do `` usable '' and `` valuable '' . 
  on the other hand , `` ways '' and `` praises '' is pretty nice , and so is `` world '' and `` unheard '' . 
  the second is that they 're very literal . 
  the best rhymes use turns of phrase , figures of speech , and cultural references ( though , cultural references are difficult to make good riddles out of for a fantasy game , because they will frequently be something that has no reason to exist in the fantasy setting ) . 
  some of yours do have one of these aspects , but they also contain a huge amount of literal information that makes them completely clear . 
  for example :, 
   i fly but i am not a bird like it may seem, 
   i can not see unless i scream, 
  oh , it 's clearly a bat . 
  no need to read on . 
  which means i never get to your cultural reference `` and i have been misnamed by one who takes blood away '' . 
  it 's the same with a lot of them . 
  there are one or two lines which make it really obvious from a literal perspective , instead of having to rely on the riddle as a whole and figuring out what the turns of phrase are referring to . 
  in a way , you could say that they 're * too * easy . 
  and they are , but that is n't really the crux of the problem , it 's the * reason * that they 're so easy that makes them subpar riddles . 
   toad or frog, 
  has to be toad . 
  that 's what the first line is about . 
  frogs are cute , toads are n't . 
  i went back through my history looking for a thread from ages ago that i remember having a really , really good idea for how this solution could be solved . 
  imagine my surprise when [ it was posted by the person i was going to share it with ] ( / r/modsupport/comments / 58qk44/reports _ how_they_could_be_useful_again / ) . 
  anyway , i still think you came up with a really good idea . 
  but i think stein 's counter-proposal would be an incredibly problematic one , and frankly i 'd rather see no change to how the system works than see that idea implemented . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  yeah , super weird . 
  sounds interesting , but could n't that be problematic ? 
  i 'd much rather just * not play * than be shunted in to a game where i 've got 100 + ping . 
  there 's a reason i never play on anything other than diameter right now , despite * wanting * to play the game even when there 's no one online . 
  very neat . 
  that seems like it would solve the problem . 
   they 've removed all the context of what he was saying, 
  eh , what he said is still pretty terrible in context . 
  he 's essentially saying `` i would join a political party with abhorrent policies if it meant i can get ahead , because i care nothing about morals or how my actions might affect others , and only about personal advancement . '', 
  so it 's essentially a runoff voting system ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  though if you wanted , you could do the whole thing in one go by using instant-runoff voting . 
  you lose some of the sense of suspense by doing it that way , but it could be interesting to hold an irv vote at the start , and then going on to do a round-by-round runoff vote . 
  then , at the very end , reveal who won the round-by-round vote , and who won the irv vote together , to be able to compare the two . 
  see how things changed from the first vote , to the last . 
  edit : oh , just read down the thread . 
  you * vote * for your * least * favourite ? 
  that seems an odd way to go about it . 
  to be honest i 'd prefer the runoff system . 
  everyone * votes * for their * favourite * , and then the one that gets the * least * votes is eliminated in the next round . 
   a list of the episodes , where you can choose your least favourite, 
  that 's the part that weirds me out . 
  seems counter intuitive . 
  i 'd prefer if it was voting for your favourite , and eliminating the one that gets the fewest votes at every stage . 
  nah , brackets are a bad idea . 
  they can result in episodes prematurely being eliminated which should have been in until right near the end . 
  imagine the best and second best episodes are in the same bracket at the start . 
  the second best episode is eliminated * straight away * . 
  when it should have been alive in the final round . 
  this is especially bad in something like this , where you can expect a growing audience with each round . 
  so something that might have won if more people saw it and voted , will instead lose because it was eliminated early on when the audience was small . 
   i 'm surprised you have n't already had them enabled,
