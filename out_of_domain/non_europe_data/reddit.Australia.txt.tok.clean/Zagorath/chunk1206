  sorry for the necro ( came here from google after searching for the same question ) , but why are you surprised that they were n't enabled ? 
  are n't the tips pointing out obvious stuff , so there 's no reason for someone with even moderate experience to enable them ? 
  petty sarcasm and ridiculous criticisms ? 
  they provided you with a very detailed explanation of the problems with this class which must have taken a long time for them to create , needing to read through all of your content , compare it to existing material , and then write it up in a cogent manner . 
  and they did it in a respectful and polite manner . 
  be willing to accept constructive criticism or do n't participate in this forum . 
  consider this an official warning . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  edit : to the person who reported my comment for being `` the wrong flair '' , please do explain . 
  what should it have been instead ? 
  first off , if you want help from this community , you 'll need to make sure anything on the dm 's guild is pwyw . 
  we do n't allow content behind a paywall . 
  as for editing the images , you 'll need to do that in photoshop . 
  gimp might also work , but is in general much more awkward to work with . 
  grab the brushes from the subreddit 's resources list ( see the sidebar ) and play around with those , brushing away the rip-like sections and painting the stains on top . 
  they usually call it film photography , but yeah , it 's still a thing . 
  more niche now than in , say , the '80s , but there are definitely people who still like it . 
  it 's a bit like records for music . 
  i do n't know about onedrive or dropbox . 
  whatever you use will need to be able to serve images like a web server does . 
  i.e. , you 'll need to be able to access a page that ends in '' . png '' and shows nothing but the image itself on a blank background . 
  i usually upload my images to imgur for this reason , although you may need to resize them if you want to use imgur , since it has a fairly low maximum file size for png files with a transparency layer . 
  the homebrewery has an option to save as a pdf . 
  so if you 've got some pdf-editing software , you might be able to edit your saved images into it with that . 
  it saves using your browser 's built-in print to pdf drivers , and many people have found that for whatever reason it does n't look as good when saved out to pdf as it does when displayed directly in the browser . 
  mostly due to fonts not displaying correctly . 
  this might or might not happen to you , i 'm not sure what causes it . 
  side note , you should also be aware of the relatively new rule requiring that titles be useful and descriptive . 
  because of how new it is i 'm not going to remove your post here , but may do in the future , so make sure at the least your titles describe what it is you 're sharing , and possibly also the specific type of feedback you 're after . 
   the dpt laws are aimed at multinationals with global revenue of more than $ 1 billion and australian revenue of greater than $ 25 million . 
  they will be hit with a 40 per cent tax on all profits - that is 10 per cent higher than the 30 per cent company tax rate . 
   it aims to ensure that the tax paid by global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in australia and prevents the diversion of profits offshore through contrived arrangements . 
  hmm . 
  the way smh is describing this , i 'm a little confused about how this can be particularly effective . 
  if google australia licenses ip from google singapore , which is structured as a different company , it does n't matter if google australia is taxed an extra 10 percent on their profit . 
  they 're still minimising how much profit they actually record in australia , and it 's a separate company so how are they counting the global revenue connected to the australian company . 
  from the way it 's being reported as a groundbreaking way to force multinationals to pay tax in australia , i 'm guessing the new law actually * does * solve these problems . 
  i just wish the article explained how they achieved this . 
  watch your tone . 
  there 's no reason to assume malicious intent like this . 
  / u/poligill did a good job of explaining why what op is doing here is completely fine . 
   and therefore very difficult to want to discern the beats, 
  i do n't think that was just because of the arrangements themselves . 
  the performance of them was substandard . 
  would have been better to write them up in sibelius and export the audio from that . 
  out of interest , what do you think the trick is ? 
  because i 'm normally pretty good at picking out the real intention behind a study , after having participated in quite a few psychology studies , but in this case i 'm completely lost . 
  pm if you 'd rather not spoil it for others . 
  this comment is being removed .

  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   i 'm not sure why you need to bring this attitude . 
  frankly , i think the same could be said for * both * of you here . 
  you could have replied with a kind request to lay off the personal attacks and watch his tone . 
  instead you responded in the incredibly aggressive way that you did . 
  personally , i 'm going to overlook the tone issues from both you and / u/tryft here , because apart from that , there 's some useful and constructive conversation happening . 
  i just think both of you guys need to take a step back and remember the human . 
  thanks for expressing your concern , but this post is fine . 
  it 's not a rule 6 violation because op did n't find it on here . 
  it 's not a credit violation because op linked to the original source and never claimed it was their own creation . 
  while the primary purpose of this subreddit is to share original creations , we 're really a place for sharing * and evaluating * ** any ** homebrew content . 
  / r/dndnext and / r/dnd are primarily for discussing and evaluating official material , in addition to various non-mechanical conversations . 
  to that end , this type of post belongs here far more than it does there . 
  we post ua articles , but we also occasionally get stuff like this one where people are posting stuff they do n't know the origin of , and we also get ( and allow ) stuff from places like dandwiki , all of which is allowed . 
  it 's right there at the top of the sidebar :, 
   unearthed arcana aims to be a catalog for homebrew rules , weapons , scenarios , monsters , or anything else you can think of . 
  we 're a catalogue first and foremost , and that means that even stuff found elsewhere has a place here . 
   first and final warning, 
  comes across as needlessly aggressive , and a little petty . 
  and when that 's the first line of the comment , it sets a tone for the whole comment where points that could otherwise have been read innocuously , like the quip you mentioned , instead take on an argumentative tone . 
  it would be one thing if it had come after a chain of repeated insults aimed at you . 
  but as the very first thing you say when joining the conversation , it feels like a huge escalation that did n't need to happen . 
  i actually think that as a * platform * it 's way better than steam . 
  steam has gotten a little better recently , since they stopped doing those over-the-top stupid sales with teams based on who buys the most stuff , etc. , but steam still feels somehow more like i 'm a tool in their commercial system , rather than just a person trying to play a game . 
  the trading cards , the profile levels , etc. , all just feel really artificial and , well , icky . 
  i just wan na be able to buy a game and play it . 
  i do n't want any of that other stuff , and i do n't like it * being * there . 
  the only problem with origin is its relative lack of games and people compared to steam . 
   / r/auslegal is non-lawyers happy to give bad online legal advice . 
  from a quick glance , i 'm not 100 % convinced that it 's not just sockpuppet accounts of / r/auslaw users making fun of what you just described . 
  a sort of auslawcirclejerk , as it were . 
  i mean , [ this thread ] ( / r/auslegal/comments / 62272x/my _ friend_and_i_saw_this_on_an_australian_reddit / ) and [ this one ] ( / r/auslegal/comments / 620qlt/kicked _ out_of_class_for_wearing_a_shirt_with_a / ) are too hilarious to believe they could be sincere . 
   the ui is a pain to navigate, 
  i actually think the ui is much nicer than steam 's . 
  big pictures of your games sit front and centre , rather than some cluttered boring information taking prominence , with your games relegated to a simple list off to the side . 
  [ this ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a4f_gbzkixc/maxresdefault.jpg ) is so much better than [ this ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v98/dalis/steam01.jpg ) . 
  i ca n't say i 've experienced any of the other problems myself , so i ca n't comment on them . 
  without knowing what the title is about yet , [ this comes to mind ] ( https://68.media.tumblr.com/28ba14d467c2cf2d44427d20e5b2c3b3/tumblr_nd8ya3y7ys1qk24apo1_500.gif ) . 
  also , god damn these episodes are * huge * . 
  why are n't they compressed to a more reasonable level ? 
  i 've been downloading it since before the reddit thread went up , and i 've only just passed half way . 
  length is n't the problem . 
  i ** love ** the length . 
  the file size is too large . 
  these episodes are more than twice the size of my other similar-length podcasts . 
  streaming forces you to listen at 1x audio , which is a * painful * experience when you 're used to 2x . 
  fwiw , i just got another podcast downloaded , which is 1 minute shorter than this episode , and is 47.9 mb .
