  this episode is 144 mb . 
  that 's a full * three times * the size , for little appreciable audio quality increase . 
  you can only have one flair on a post , unfortunately . 
  in this case , * subclass * makes the most sense , so i 'm going to set it to that . 
  both patrons and pacts would be classed as subclasses for warlocks , and since invocations are only for warlocks , that kinda almost counts too . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  to me , the biggest problem with horse riding is that it seems to exist * entirely * for gambling . 
  like , if you banned gambling on the ponies , the entire industry would die basically overnight . 
  olympic style horse riding would still exist , and i think * that 's * totally fine , but the melbourne cup style horse racing is closer to pokies than sport , to me . 
  as for esports , no , they 're not sports . 
  claiming they are is ridiculous . 
  but then , i also think the people who talk about chess or poker as sports are ridiculous . 
  they 're totally worthwhile activities where people compete intensely against each other , win big prizes , and have heaps of spectators . 
  all that , they share with sports . 
  but that does n't make them a sport , because it 's not a primarily physical activity . 
   a peasant bitten by a vampire could turn into a vampire , right ? 
  the flavour justification is usually that lower level people are physically and mentally not strong enough to become their own vampire . 
  instead , if they were turned , they 'd be a spawn under the control of their patron vampire . 
  well , duh ... but that 's kinda a pointless statement . 
  oh , if we took away all the balls , soccer would disappear . 
  well , no shit . 
  but gambling is n't an inherent part of horse racing . 
  there 's no rational reason that it should n't be able to exist without gambling . 
  football ( no matter what specific sport you think of when i say that ) certainly could stand on its own without gambling . 
  i do n't think horse racing could . 
  you skip the scouring of the shire i mean , i can understand skipping a lot of the other many endings lord of the rings has , but the scouring is almost the entire * point * . 
  it 's the resolution to all the character development the hobbits ( especially , but not only , merry and pippin ) went through throughout the rest of the novel . 
  it shows you how they 've changed and grown thanks to their experiences with the rohirrim , gondorians , or in mordor . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  is it really that obviously something an aussie would say ? 
  i do n't actually follow the sport very closely ( as you can probably tell -- i detest it ) , but i 've always thought the melbourne cup was one of , if not * the * biggest horse racing events there are . 
  like mentioning it is the equivalent of mentioning the superbowl , the ashes , or the fifa world cup final . 
  anyway , i do n't care one way or the other about gambling opportunities . 
  i 'm angry about how few ads i 'm seeing about it . 
  i 'm sick of the gambling ads only being cut-aways every 5 minutes while i watch the footy . 
  i want a full-time sportsbet rep on the commentator team . 
  and more youtube prerolls for betting companies too , please . 
  i find it hilarious that the simple english wikipedia uses `` change '' instead of `` edit '' . 
   hermes and hephaestus , which are the greek counterparts to mercury and vulcan, 
  why the comparison to their roman counterparts ? 
  surely the greek ones are the * more * well known ones , except for * maybe * neptune/poseidon and mars/ares . 
  the greek mythology is the one that gets most taught in primary schools and shared via video games and pop culture . 
  yeah . 
  i learnt quite a bit of it in primary school . 
  i think it 's the only mythology that got covered in normal classes , really . 
  i disagree entirely . 
  the physical activity is what differentiates sports from non-sport games . 
  otherwise , you would have to include chess , poker , debate competitions , and many more obviously * not * sporting activities under the umbrella of sport . 
  the problem is n't the file format , it 's the bitrate . 
  i do n't know what rate this show is encoded at , but it 's clearly much higher than it needs to be . 
  grey could probably halve the bitrate and still have great quality audio . 
   if it takes a significant amount of time and effort to be competitive, 
  the problem with this is that it adds in a heap of things that are n't sports . 
  poker , chess , bridge , debate , even trivia all require effort to be able to compete at a high level . 
  not to mention , defining it in terms of time spent would seem to be concentrating on the sport at a professional level , which is not where most sport happens . 
  lots of people run or cycle for leisure -- lots more people than compete in those sports . 
  the same is true of sports like soccer . 
  defining `` sport '' in terms of competition does n't * per se * invalidate these people 's recreational sport , but it does * implicitly * minimise them . 
  i just ... what ? 
  it 's by ** far ** the worst . 
  legends ' best barely passes arrow 's worst , and that 's saying something . 
  it 's a show that does n't even make an * attempt * to be good . 
  the writing team constantly fucks up the most * basic * facts to do with history which , in a * show about time travelling * they should absolutely ** not ** be doing . 
  this has gotten even * worse * in season 2 than it was in season 1 . 
  the dialogue characters are given is absolutely cringe-worthy , and the delivery rarely improves things . 
  it 's episode ii levels of bad . 
  the characters constantly fuck up the timeline -- way worse than barry ever has -- and yet the consequences of this are * never * explored , and they also somehow never impact any of the other shows , either . 
  so the show ends up feeling entirely free of consequence , because we know that nothing they do is actually going to matter in the long run . 
  the katana episode was pretty great , though . 
  and i do agree that the villain team up is pretty cool , and the stuff with reverse flash is * great * . 
  i do n't think the villains have been * set up * well -- their explanation for why all these villains have teamed up is n't a convincing one to me -- but if i ignore that and just look at the villains themselves , i like what they 're doing . 
  edit : damn it guys , downvotes for well reasoned statements of opinion are * not * cool on this subreddit . 
  the entire reason for this subreddit is to get away from that kind of petty bullshit seen on the other show subreddits . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as this is your second warning , any future unflaired submissions may be removed . 
   this was honestly done in 4e and it was pretty subpar, 
  eh , i thought it was pretty great . 
  i saw a lot of people saying it was n't very good , but by my calculations it seemed pretty much on par with the rogue . 
   i 'd recommend going for a 5 level prestige class, 
  while i think a full class * could * work , i agree with you that a prestige class is the best option for a vampire . 
   honestly i 'd say just make a racial template, 
  now there i have to completely disagree . 
  even a full vampire race ( such as [ this one ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) approximates -- it 's a 5e adaptation of 4e 's vryloka , not * quite * the same as a vampire , but most of the flavour and mechanics match up well enough that you can reflavour a vryloka as a vampire ) is unable to encompass everything that makes a vampire , a vampire . 
  you need the weaknesses to light , water , religious symbols , etc. , you need the blood drinking , the charming , the shapechanging . 
  it 's too much for a full race , let alone a racial template , which by necessity must be * less * feature packed than a full race , since it has to balance along with the base race 's features .

  so , mechanically , you need some amount of scaling . 
  a prestige class represents that * perfectly * , and a full class could work as well , if it was well made . 
  thematically , it works perfectly fine as well . 
  just like a sorcerer has the in-built power all along , but must concentrate on honing their abilities to channel it -- represented by taking levels in the sorcerer class -- so too must a vampire take levels in their prestige class to become a more powerful vampire . 
  get the basic weaknesses and maybe some minor flavour benefits for free , and the rest of it as you level .

  oh right . 
  by the time i saw your comment i had already forgotten what grey 's suggestions were :\\, 
  sorry for the rambly comment , in that case . 
  athletics is one particular sport/subset of sports .
