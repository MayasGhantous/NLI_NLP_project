  a lot of sports are not athletics events , but all athletics events are sports . 
  esports are neither . 
   anyway , the us acknowledges the esports . 
  nba teams are investing on league of legends teams ( but i think that has more to do with the potential revenues to be had than their actual recognition of it ) . 
  news outlets are talking about it . 
  so esports as a sport is getting some attention . 
  i do n't think there 's anything wrong with acknowledging that they * exist * , or recognising them with media coverage , legal status ( including for visas ) , etc. 
  the problem lies only in calling them a `` sport '' . 
  which clearly most people do not , otherwise there would be no need for the `` e '' prefix . 
   while debate and trivia are n't sports ( calling them competitions make much more sense ) , poker and chess are considered, 
  i 've always found this kind of ridiculous . 
  personally , i do * not * consider poker and chess sports . 
  i know a lot of people do , but i can just find no way to justify this , just like i can find no way to justify asia and europe being separate continents , even though most people do hold that belief . 
  it makes it much easier to define what a sport is . 
  it has to involve using some significant physical skill . 
  early 20s . 
  and just because a lot of people watch something , does n't make it any more of a sport . 
  millions of people watch election coverage , and the academy awards , and things like that . 
  but they 're not sports . 
  because sports are about physical activity . 
  you can add google and wiktionary to that list . 
  so , basically , * all * the major reputable dictionaries define sports in terms of physical exertion , making / u/hannasanarion 's claim a blatant lie . 
  chess does n't even straddle the line . 
  it just straight up is n't a sport . 
  to me , darts and pool straddle the line . 
  to the person who reported this post for not being true , you should be aware that truth is neither required nor particularly * desired * on this subreddit . 
  good stories are all the matter . 
  flair is useful for archival and searching the subreddit . 
  you can add a flair by either clicking the little `` flair '' button below your post , or making a comment with '' [ flair ] '' in it , as a top-level comment . 
  for example , if the comment just read :, 
   [ mechanic ], 
  or , alternatively , your title can include relevant information . 
  for example , if your title says `` college of '' , it will automatically get the flair `` subclass '' . 
  it 's really happening , but they 've already said that they 've got an out . 
  the top 10 or so voted names will be given to some committee which will hand pick the name . 
  as opposed to the original boat , where it was kinda implied that the internet 's name would be * the * name . 
  they did also say that even if it 's not an official part of the name though , it could be embraced as a mascot . 
  people dressed up in a giant foam foot , etc. 
  the lycanthrope and vampire rules presented in the monster manual are * terrible * and should never be used for serious player concepts . 
  they exist as temporary curses that the player will be getting rid of asap . 
  what we are discussing here is vampires as a * player concept * . 
  and that needs to be balanced . 
  a racial template would need to be done more like the revenant one in an unearthed arcana article . 
  so too would a full race , a prestige class , or a full class . 
  no , it should n't . 
  just like you give * players * the ability to have some last dramatic words after the rules say they have `` died '' , so too should npcs have that opportunity . 
  it 's not taking away the players ' power , because the character is already effectively dead and beyond the point healing magic can cure them . 
  you 're just giving them the opportunity to say one last thing . 
  it 's the reason i view * revivify * as not technically a resurrection spell , but instead a spell that brings people back from a state where they are so close to dead that no less powerful magic can save them . 
  riddle 1 has a typo : `` i am have a spine '', 
   ca n't really say that fighters second wind is n't magical, 
  umm , yes i can . 
  second wind is in no way magical . 
  second wind is 5e 's answer to what 4e called a `` healing surge '' . 
  [ read this ] ( http://slushlush.com/2012/11/rules-of-engagement/ ) to see what a healing surge might play out like in the fiction . 
  no need for magic involvement at all . 
  i ca n't find it for certain , unfortunately , but [ i 've had success with one as large as 5 mb ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mdfc7he.png ) . 
  last time i tried to upload an image with a transparent background i just tried a bunch of times until i got one that worked . 
  i 've also had images large enough to take up [ full height -- half width ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jda5cel.png ) and [ full width taking up about a third of a page vertically ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r76u77n.png ) that fit in under 2 mb , so the limit is high enough to work with . 
  from googling , some other good options you might be able to use include deviantart and smugmug . 
  i have n't used them myself though , so i ca n't say for certain . 
  i believe they also involve sharing the images with a public profile tied to all your other images , and with comments etc. , which makes using them as a host for images to be used in a document a little awkward , but it could still work . 
  the problem is n't that they screw things up , it 's that they never seem to try to avoid screwing up , and even worse , they never do anything to * fix * the problems once they 're created . 
  they happily waltz up to heaps of characters throughout history and interfere with their lives and let them find out about the future and advanced technology . 
  it 's also that * despite * all this , there never seem to be any * consequences * . 
  all of their meddling and changing the past never actually result in anything changing . 
  when the flash time travels , they make a point of showing how it has consequences even in ways that might be completely unexpected . 
  when the legends do it , literally * nothing * changes . 
  maybe , sort of . 
  the problem is that that definition excludes things like darts and bowling , which admittedly i consider borderline , but i * would * call sports . 
  but i dunno , maybe they should n't be counted either ? 
  i would highly recommend [ this vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
  it gets you all of the vampire flavour you could want , while being well balanced and giving a good sense of progression . 
  it 's one of the very best pieces of homebrew that has * ever * been created for this game . 
  as for your example itself , i wo n't go through the whole thing , but i will say that it does n't seem promising judging by the first few levels . 
  charm person up to 5 times per day , without being at the expense of anything else ? 
  two bonus asis , like the fighter ? 
  hidden strength is just a crazy feature . 
  the sunlight damage is decent , but 20 is pretty huge . 
  that will straight up * kill * most 1st level players . 
  it also gives no provision for covering up by wearing a heavy cloak , or things like that . 
  the subclasses each also give crazy abilities . 
  increasing to a d10 and gaining * permanent * resistance to all physical attacks plus necrotic even the barbarian -- the ultimate master of shrugging off attacks -- only gets that benefit while raging . 
  or alternatively , the option to charm person an * unlimited * amount , along with even * more * spellcasting , in addition to having a non-standard ( and significantly better than normal ) spell save dc . 
  in terms of flavour , it also has problems . 
  why did you say they do n't need to sleep ? 
  vampires have always needed to sleep . 
  that 's what the coffin is for !, 
  there 's not a single mention of a requirement to drink blood , or benefits/drawbacks for doing/not doing it . 
  it 's also * really * badly laid out . 
  none of the abilities base class abilities tell you what level they 're at , you have to look at the table for that . 
  you keep saying `` hit dices '' . 
  dice is already plural . 
  the only time * you 're * using dice is when it 's meant in the * singular * !, 
  the singular form of `` dice '' is `` die '' . 
  i have no idea how hit dice mastery and masteries are supposed to work , because the wording is so opaque . 
  look , i really think you 'd be better served just using / u/the _ singular_anyone 's prestige class . 
  but if you * really * want to make a full class work , it 's not necessarily * impossible * . 
  you 're going to have to work * really * hard to reign in the power of this one , improve some of the flavour problems , and tidy up the language . 
  some art would also really help .
