  it 's not only the best option for playing a vampire , it 's one of the best bits of homebrew for 5e out there in general . 
  if you 'd prefer a race , my recommendation is [ this one ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) . 
  vryloka are not * quite * the same thing as vampires , but most of the mechanics should match up still , and the flavour is mostly the same . 
  it 's a far more compelling race to play both in terms of lore and mechanics than the zendikar one . 
  macos , but based on a conversation i had a week or so ago , i thought chrome always brings along its own font renderer , including its own choice of emoji . 
  i actually got two texts from uq , from two different numbers ( not sure what that was about ... ) , but not until about an hour after kozimix 's comment went up . 
  and this comment chain is about australia . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  fuck me that was a good episode . 
  some really powerful stuff there . 
  i think it 's the best episode this season , and one of the best in a * long * time . 
  yeah that 's the same order i would use . 
  i thought 3 was a * serious * miss , but all three of the others were pretty good . 
   4 stories in 20 minutes is too much, 
  one of the strongest episodes of avatar had a format nearly identical to this episode . 
  tales of ba sing se actually did * six * different stories in its 20 minute run time , with some being classic well-regarded comedy , and others being really touching and heart felt . 
  it 's definitely a format that can work . 
   not sure what your comment indicated , whether you never liked the `` character '' or never liked the character 's use in the show . 
  honestly , i think a lot of people on this subreddit have a hard time differentiating the two . 
  they see him as an unlikeable guy , and therefore they just want him out of the show . 
  missing the fact that , as a character , he works really well to expose some of haley 's flaws , and his ridicule-ableness makes for great comedy . 
  over 60 % of people want neither boost nor bomb timers . 
  over 55 % of people want neither pup nor bomb timers , and over 55 % want neither pup nor boost timers . 
  that sounds like a pretty huge landslide to me . 
  as of this writing , 449 people have voted and over 60 % of them want neither boost nor bomb timers . 
  over 55 % of people want neither pup nor bomb timers , and over 55 % want neither pup nor boost timers . 
  that 's a pretty damn solid `` no '' to me . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  the problem with timers is n't that it allows people to know when something is going to spawn so they can take advantage of it , it 's that it takes away the * skill * of working out when something is going to spawn , so you can take advantage of it . 
  nah , legally , they have every right to do this . 
  the codex would almost certainly have failed the fair use test , and there are really no other provisions of copyright law he could rely upon . 
  really frustrating though , because i did n't have a copy of it saved myself . 
  i 'll add myself to the list of people who would like a copy if one is available anywhere . 
  legally , it 's a legit takedown regardless of whether it 's in beyond or not . 
  it 's wizards ' ip , and they can do whatever they want with it , and tell other people how not to use it . 
  morally , i do n't think beyond makes any difference one way or another . 
  it 's content they 've put out there * for free * for the world to see . 
  all this did was take freely available stuff and put it all together in one nice package . 
   wizards is generally pretty cool about using their properties for free , fan purposes, 
  no they 're not . 
  they 've been * extremely * litigious about taking down anything that could even possibly step on their toes . 
  taking down every free fan-made service they can find , without even offering their own alternatives to them . 
  they have no obligation to send takedowns for this kind of thing . 
  the codex was in violation of copyright not trademark law , and it is only trademarks that can lose their legal status if not enforced .

  imo [ this take on the same idea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-fd8twn8lw ) is much more effective . 
  it has more fugue-like qualities . 
  i really like the look of this app . 
  some small feedback . 
  in the pc create/edit form , the name , playername , alignment , race , and class forms do n't automatically start with a capital letter . 
  the same problem exists in the campaign edit form , on the campaign * name * field ( but the description field * does n't * have this problem ) . 
  i really like the fact that class levels automatically switch to the numerical keyboard ( not enough apps make intelligent use of the keyboard api , in my opinion ) , but it 's disappointing that ac , hit points , and speed do n't do the same thing . 
  from a ui perspective , it seems like there should be a `` save '' button or something ; sure , just hitting back automatically saves , but it 's a little awkward and unintuitive . 
  the same problem exists when creating a new campaign . 
  there are three main things stopping me from buying the paid version right now , though . 
  one is no screenshots demonstrating how adding your own monsters works . 
  the second is that i ca n't figure out any way to keep track of the most important thing : damage and hit points as they change during an encounter . 
  at a minimum , a `` add damage/add healing '' button that lets you enter a number . 
  but even better would be if it could actually roll damage based on the abilities in a monster 's statblock . 
  the third , and least significant of these , is the comparative lack of useful information on the `` encounter '' page ; all it shows you is their name and initiative count . 
  it would be super useful if it also had their hp and ac . 
  there are a few other things i 'd suggest , but i 've probably already overstayed my welcome , so i 'll leave it there . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try submitting to / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to share gaming advice . 
  sorry , but this post is being removed . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is a subreddit for 5e material only . 
  what you 've done here is great , but it should be shared on a more appropriate subreddit , like a system-neutral one or a sotdl-specific one . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  rivers do n't split , they * combine * , except when forming a delta right near the coast . 
  small streams can sometimes split , but they are generally too small to mark on a map , and even this is rare enough to be particularly noteworthy when it happens . 
  note that for the purposes of defining a `` split '' , a lake counts as just another part of the river . 
  so a lake will generally only have one outlet . 
  the splits at kjolr , peter 's fort , south of eren 's peak , and east of aramore all make little sense . 
  rivers also take the lowest path they can . 
  for a bog to form , it will usually need to be lower than the areas that surround it . 
  that makes it seem a little unusual that the river is completely circumnavigating the bog , rather than going * through * it . 
  you 've got an area called dead deamers gulf , but it 's not a gulf . 
  not sure if that was intentional or not . 
  that 's about all the problems i can spot with it . 
  hope it helps . 
  it 's probably worth being aware that * fireball * and * lighting bolt * are kept restricted to wizards , sorcerers , and a few subclasses for balance reasons . 
  they 're 3rd level spells balanced as though they were more like 4th or 5th level spells , designed as an intentional part of the balance of those classes . 
   they 're a blast, 
  i think it 's the combination of chromaticism + fugue which can make it sound a bit off . 
   i see it less as `` do n't remove skill from tagpro ! '', 
  and more as `` do n't remove one particular skill i already have ! '', 
  for me it 's * definitely * the former . 
  i 'm not very good at timing personally , but i still see using timers as cheating , and learning to remember the time when something gets picked up as an important skill . 
   i am curious what you would classify what i called a gulf thought, 
  so , to start with , a gulf is essentially a really big bay . 
  for example , [ the gulf of mexico ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-media.venngage.com/784792-702c4258d696ecce9afcb081ef65a7c1.jpeg ) is marked by the florida peninsula and southern mexico , or [ the gulf of carpentaria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/gulf_of_carpentaria_map.png/220px-gulf_of_carpentaria_map.png ) is surrounded by cape york peninsula and the northern territory . 
  what you 've got there might not necessarily have a name . 
  the islands nearby might be an archipelago . 
  if the area is tropical or subtropical , it seems likely that there could be a coral reef that would form there , which could lead to the area being called an [ atoll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atoll ) . 
  it would be a really big atoll , but not unprecedented -- about the same size as the largest in real life . 
   would this make it more probable of having more outlets, 
  probably * less * likely , actually , i think . 
  but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  generally , though , exceptions and weird behaviour are more likely to occur on a small scale .
