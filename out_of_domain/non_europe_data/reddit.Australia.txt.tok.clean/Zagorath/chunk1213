  if the css you 're working on sits on top of something else you do n't have control over , re-implementing may not be an option . 
  reddit mods have to deal with this all the time , for example , because we ca n't change reddit 's css , only implement a custom subreddit css over the top of it . 
  i liked the first season of it a lot , but i thought the second season was pretty meh at best . 
  i really hated the punisher plot . 
  that concept was done * way * better in the dcau 's batman tas episode `` judgment day '' . 
  i like the dark grittiness . 
  it works for these characters quite well . 
  i can easily imagine a batman show done in the same style . 
  it 's not the only style that works , and it absolutely would n't work for a captain america or superman show/movie ( \\* * coughcough * \\* * mos * \\* * cough * \\* ) , but for these characters it is one option that works . 
  but i 've always enjoyed this kind of dark , brutal , story . 
  stories which are more challenging are just * so * effective , to me , much more than easy lighthearted shows . 
  go to the opposite end of the spectrum and you 've got legends of tomorrow , which is just * abysmal * . 
  as for feeling disconnected with the mcu , i do wish that the movies would incorporate at least a few elements introduced by the shows , but the relationship works in the other direction quite well . 
  none of these shows could exist * at all * without the avengers . 
  it is the destruction within the streets of new york caused by those characters in their quest to save the world that resulted in the types of street level thuggery that our defenders fight against . 
  she 's definitely better this season than she was in the middle seasons , but i think her role in season 1 was the best . 
  i 've found it difficult to believe her journey from corporate it support to world-renowned mega-hacker ( especially with the show 's increasingly terrible tech lingo ) . 
  so if lawful good paladin jack dogooder goes from a country with laws similar to our own , to a country with laws where killing those you defeat in battle slowly and painfully is required by law , he goes from lawful good to chaotic good , all of a sudden ? 
  defining the lawful/chaotic spectrum in terms of laws of the land makes no sense , and is a terrible idea . 
  there 's nothing chaotic about palpatine . 
  he 's an almost perfect example of a lawful evil character . 
  working within the structures of a legal hierarchy in order to further his own gain . 
  he 's only a skin tan away from being a devil , for the gods ' sakes !, 
  it 's quite well known that he 's one of the best fighter pilots in the galaxy . 
  plus , assuming you 're talking about episode iv , when he 's fighting the rebels as they try to destroy the death star , you could probably just say `` force shenanigans '' . 
  probably felt the presence of his son and/or felt that the death star 's destruction was imminent . 
  even if he did n't consciously recognise that was the reason , he probably felt the force telling him he had to be out there . 
  it 's shown quite readily in the prequel trilogy , and that was based on a line from obi-wan in episode iv to luke saying `` he was the best star pilot in the galaxy , and a cunning warrior . 
  i understand that you 've become quite a good pilot yourself . '', 
  not much reviewing to be done on a featureless political map . 
  yeah the coastlines would benefit from a bit of work , but your updated version is pretty close to finished i 'd say . 
  some small islands dotted around would help . 
  without features though , there 's not much else to say . 
  rivers , grassland , desert , mountains , etc. , and how they 're placed relative to one another . 
   people still cling to the past , though , and do n't realize there are better competitive games out there now , like overwatch, 
  i do n't really play either game , but how can you compare overwatch to lol ? 
  are n't they two completely different types of game ? 
  moba vs fps ( or might be over-the-shoulder shooter ) . 
  it 's like recommending someone who enjoys civ to play overwatch . 
  or at * least * like saying to go from civ to age of empires . 
  was n't testing the death star ordered by someone else ? 
  tarkin if you 're talking about episode iv , and that other dude who was in charge in rogue one . 
   then gotten all my information from the red letter media reviews, 
  they 're honestly really , * really * terrible reviews . 
  they 're alright from an entertainment point of view , but he goes way too far in criticising the prequels . 
  the acting was bad , the writing was worse . 
  but the overall * concept * of them was solid . 
  he criticises them for a number of things which are n't really even * bad * , so much as just neutral , and even a couple of good things they do get called out as negatives . 
   and one of them was not our actual position, 
  well , one of them * was * our actual position . 
  just , you know , not very * much * , relative to the surrounding stars , and even less relative to the centre of the galaxy . 
  it annoys me that the federation star on that has eight points . 
  i tried ( repeatedly ) to change it to seven , but it kept getting reverted on me . 
  i have no idea where to post that , or how to best design 5x5 seven-pointed star . 
  but i 've tried both what it currently is and [ this design ] ( https://www.pixilart.net/art/federation-star-36aa5203f15fca9 ) ( that one was made in conjunction with some mates so it would get finished before being reverted ) . 
  neither is ideal and i 'm sure someone else could come up with a better one , but at least both have the right number of points . 
  my uni 's exams are 10 -- 24 june , and the other unis around me are more or less the same time period . 
  are others different ? 
  it 's one of those lines , like `` luke , i am your father '' that never actually happened , but gets across the same * meaning * as what was actually said , while also clearly informing others in the conversation about the context , which makes it more shareable , and thus more likely to be a successful meme ( `` meme '' used here in the traditional sense as dawkins meant it ) . 
  it gets spread so much that people , with their fallible memories , end up misremembering the original context . 
  this would probably * kill * diameter . 
  at peak we 've got maybe 20 people on normally . 
  i usually think of it as the sort of damage we often see in science fiction and non-explicitly-magical fantasy , in the form of `` generic powerful beams '' . 
  i think [ iron man 's blasts ] ( https://youtu.be/finpwdn4gny?t=1m18s ) are basically a perfect example of * eldritch blast * in its most generic form . 
  of course , eldritch blast is a * perfect * candidate for reflavouring . 
  if i 'm playing a fiendlock , i like to describe it as smelling like sulphur and brimstone , and looking like a white hot flame, 
  captain cold 's gun in the flash/legends of tomorrow seems to switch at will between freezing in targets solid and `` generic energy beam '' , depending on what serves the narrative best . 
  when it 's * not * actually freezing people , i 'd say its behaviour is more like what i would call force damage than the cold damage it would be doing if the show were consistent . 
  [ vaatu 's giant beam attacks in the legend of korra ] ( https://youtu.be/kavk2pmxaoi?t=1m37s ) are another good example of what i think of as force . 
  also the spells that we see in harry potter that do n't have an explicit effect , or which just kinda generically `` cause damage '' . 
  for example , [ the misfiring of * expelliarmus * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hndsxsnde5e ) that we see so often just kinda knocking the target back ( instead of , you know , * disarming * them ) , but also whatever the hell sirius was doing from 2:16 to 2:26 . 
  i know that . 
  i was just pointing out ( mostly as a way to subtly poke fun at the people you were responding to ) that we are , in fact , moving , as our solar system orbits the galactic centre . 
  ninja edit : incidentally , i just did the calculation . 
  we travelled about 0.3 light years in 40 years , relative to the galactic centre . 
  as i explained in the other thread , ** reality does not change ** . 
  you are misremembering the line , that 's all . 
  your username seems painfully appropriate in this subreddit . 
   false memories what you refer to is confabulation, 
  with a false premise like this , even sound logic can lead to a false conclusion . 
  the truth is that human memory is in fact extremely poor , and you do n't need to be suffering a psychiatric condition to misremember things . 
  there have been dozens of studies into different areas of this , resulting in a [ multitude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eyewitness_memory ) [ of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misattribution_of_memory ) [ different ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconstructive_memory ) [ ways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_memory ) [ in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/source-monitoring_error ) [ which ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misinformation_effect ) [ a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weapon_focus ) [ false ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memory_conformity ) [ memory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repressed_memory ) can be formed or exhibit itself . 
  everything from [ mothers forgetting important medical information about their infants by the time they 're 8 ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895435688901308 ) to how [ there is no correlation between * believing * you have a good memory objectively , and actually having a good memory ( or between believing you have a bad memory and actually having a bad one ) , in healthy people ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607860701797281 ) , to [ how jurors in a trial will , unless given substantial reason not to , trust eyewitness testimony more than they should ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/law/1/4/909/ ) . 
  so , was i wasting my time pulling up all those references , then ? 
  i 'm guessing i probably was ... 
   le does n't mean you are always following the law or keeping your word unless you 're a demon, 
  le does n't mean shit if you 're a demon , because demons are chaotic evil . 
  * devils * are the lawful evil , always keep your word ( but in the strictest , most beneficial way for you ) , form pacts with mortals types . 
  there 's the little star in the southern cross ( which is what pandas was referring to ) . 
  then there 's the federation star , which has seven points ( though some people , irritatingly , keep changing it to eight on this flag ) , and sits under the union jack . 
  it 's completely unrelated to the sc . 
  that flag has one too many points in the federation star though . 
  yeah i ' v been fighting with a bunch of people over that , too . 
  i sent out a bunch of pms to the culprits the last time i cleaned it up , so i 'm hoping it 'll stick around a little longer this time . 
  this is a subreddit for sharing homebrew content , not asking for ideas about minis . 
  try / r/dnd for that . 
  i 'm removing this post . 
  me , i 'd use a circle cut out of paper probably . 
  maybe a circle moulded out of air-dry clay . 
  air dry clay is actually really bloody useful .
