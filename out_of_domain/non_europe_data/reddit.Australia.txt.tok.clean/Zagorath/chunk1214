  do n't have to be a modeller , just carve out a 1 , 2 , or 3 inch circle and write what it is on top . 
  they 're supposed to be the wisest in the galaxy . 
  they 're supposed to be able to feel the force . 
  and yet an extremely powerful sith lord manages to get in to the galactic senate and even become its [ dictator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_dictator ) , all without them having * any * idea . 
  they also have an overly strict code . 
  their rules against love are what * really * drove anakin to the dark side . 
  it 's also very arguable that they were being unfair on anakin by not making him a jedi master . 
  we unfortunately do n't ( in canon ) have enough evidence to definitively say one way or another , but anakin clearly believed he was good enough to be on the council , and it certainly seems obi-wan did as well . 
  they held him back out of fear -- ironically , considering fear is an emotion they explicitly outlaw -- of what he is like , and of what he might become . 
   he 's mostly motivated by his feelings for padme , proving himself , and gaining more power, 
  further up the thread , i argued that i do n't think anakin was cg . 
  so on that front , you and i agree . 
  but i ca n't agree with your reasoning here . 
  these things you describe here could * easily * plant him in chaotic territory , to me . 
  you 're saying he 's motivated by self-interest , and the interests of others only where it is * really * his self-interest . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're referring to / u/cunningallusionment or / u/palazard95 here , so i 'll provide the explanation just in case . 
  hopefully someone will find it useful , anyway . 
  they do a very good job of justifying it logically . 
  they do a less good job of demonstrating it * emotionally * . 
  that 's down to mediocre acting and terrible script writing . 
  but the * ideas * behind the prequels are actually really , really good . 
  they just needed a better screenwriter , director , and actors . 
  his turn against the jedi comes for a number of reasons . 
  the main one is love . 
  love is , at this point in time , outlawed by the jedi . 
  in fact , the jedi outlaw * any * emotion , pretty much . 
  anakin loved padme enormously ( seriously , listen to john williams ' `` across the stars '' and tell me it is n't the most beautiful thing -- you just have to kind of imagine the writing and acting of their relationship had been a better fit ) , but his relationship was forbidden by the jedi council , an organisation he had immense respect for . 
  add to this the seeming lack of respect the council showed him . 
  in his eyes , he was every bit good enough to join the council and become a jedi master . 
  there 's at least some evidence to suggest he 's probably right about that . 
  but they refused him the promotion . 
  the reason for their refusal ? 
  fear . 
  they were afraid of him being too powerful . 
  ironic that the council , who is so adamantly against emotions like fear , should refuse to promote one of their own because of this very emotion . 
  also ironic that their refusal to promote him forms part of the reason he went to the dark side . 
  the final reason anakin turned to the dark side relates closely to both the first and second . 
  he wanted to save padme 's life , and the life of his unborn child . 
  he was having premonitions of their death . 
  he had had premonitions of his mother 's death not long before he discovered that she had been taken by sand people and died as a result , so his fear of losing another loved one seemed very founded . 
  and yet his concerns were * dismissed * by the jedi council . 
  you should n't be afraid of losing someone because you should n't be loving someone , they said . 
  this fear you 're experiencing is part of the reason we wo n't promote you to jedi master . 
  when you look at the prequels in broad strokes like this , they become great . 
  the problem lied entirely in the details . 
  where the original got both the details and the concept right , the prequels ( likely thanks to george lucas having too much direct control ) failed on the details , but were every bit as good if you ignore the specific way things happened . 
  the way anakin fell to the dark side was absolutely masterfully conceived , but executed with the finesse of a six year old riding a bicycle for the first time . 
  yeah , i popped in here * very * briefly back when the sub trended , but i was chased away very quickly by the conspiracists . 
  came back a little more confidently this time , but i doubt i 'll be here to stay . 
  the stress of dealing with this level of irrationality is just too tough . 
   currently , it is not strictly illegal to record private phone conversations without consent in victoria , queensland or the northern territory . 
   in the act , nsw , south australia , tasmania and western australia , the rules are much stricter .

  wow , this might be the * only * time that auto-inserted url shit is actually useful . 
  i 'd have been going to grab it anyway . 
  also :, 
   even if you were involved in a conversation that was legally recorded , it 's still illegal [ in queensland ] to communicate the conversation or publish it without the permission of the other people involved in the conversation ( with some exceptions ) . 
  using queensland because that 's what happened to pop up for me when i googled . 
  definitely check the law in your state . 
  this sub is dedicated to discussing the mandela effect . 
  that a lot of people here choose to believe in irrational explanations for it , rather than trying to seek out the interesting reality , is not my fault . 
  i 'm here mainly because i think the potential real explanations could be very interesting , and that 's the conversation i want to be having . 
  ( and , you 'll note , that 's what my first comment in this thread was . ), 
  it 's hard to have that conversation when you have to wade through all the bullshit pseudoscience . 
  charging cables are more useful for at the airport itself . 
  and a long one can be good because it means you can plug in and then stand a little distance away from the wall , instead of being crowded around where everyone else is crowded . 
   you say insert outrageous claim here and i say `` someone else says you are full of shit '' ( badass credible citation ) . 
  here 's the problem with this statement . 
  my claim is not the outrageous one , yours is . 
  you 're claiming that the past literally changes . 
  that notion would overhaul ** everything ** science understands about time and entropy . 
  my claim is modest by comparison . 
  people forget things sometimes . 
  that does n't , in and of itself , necessarily mean you 're wrong . 
  but it does mean you 'll need * substantial * evidence to back it up . 
  and your source does not really back up your claim . 
  your source backs up part of the * premise * your claim is based on , but not the conclusion . 
  yes , there has been research into witness credibility . 
  absent any other evidence ( which neither you , nor i -- to this point in the conversation -- have provided ) , the only other mitigating factors are one 's belief in the scientific method . 
  and that leaves me to believe that the truth might in the worst case be stretched , but not completely broken . 
  you did not provide evidence that the research was biased in any way , and all the study did was demonstrate that if an eyewitness is confident in what they believe , other people are more likely to believe that witness , regardless of whether or not the eyewitness is * correct * . 
  the researchers suggested that if the jury is told about this phenomenon , they might be less likely to bring an incorrect verdict on the back of a falsely confident witness . 
  that all seems reasonable to me . 
  since you are making a positive claim without evidence , it would be perfectly valid for me to dismiss said claim without evidence . 
  but , since i 've already prepared the evidence in a conversation with someone else , i 'll copy and paste it here . 
  there has been extensive research into everything from [ mothers forgetting important medical information about their infants by the time they 're 8 ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895435688901308 ) to how [ there is no correlation between * believing * you have a good memory objectively , and actually having a good memory ( or between believing you have a bad memory and actually having a bad one ) , in healthy people ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607860701797281 ) , to [ how jurors in a trial will , unless given substantial reason not to , trust eyewitness testimony more than they should ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/law/1/4/909/ ) . 
  only one of these studies is related to courts , but all of them point to memory not being as good as we think . 
  so the `` biased research '' argument carries little weight . 
  whoops . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  i completely forgot about this . 
  anyway , starting with prestige classes . 
  3 . x had a problem where mechanics were strongly emphasised over roleplay . 
  there were tiny niche options for absolutely everything conceivable , and often options that did the same thing in terms of flavour , but just * better * in mechanics . 
  it was a powergamer 's ** dream ** , and prestige classes were kinda the epitome of that . 
  in 5e , they have changed * significantly * . 
  [ wizards of the coast put one out in their unearthed arcana beta material ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) . 
  basically , in 5e , prestige classes are meant to be concepts that require completely some specific roleplay requirement before you can achieve it . 
  seeking out a particular master who can teach you , discovering a complicated ritual , or in the case of vampires , getting bitten . 
  like many things in the game , you need to get over preconceived notions about how things work , because they work * very * differently in 5e , even if they share a name and might share some similarities .
