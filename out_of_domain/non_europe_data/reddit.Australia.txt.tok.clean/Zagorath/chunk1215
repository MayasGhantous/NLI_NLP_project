  ( see also : everything about sneak attack ; opportunity attacks . ), 
  instead , look at what they are in * this * edition , and take them on their own merits , as if nothing previous had existed . 
  the healing restriction of being undead is the most substantial one , but it 's not nearly as impassible as you seem to think . 
  healing potions and hit dice on a long rest have been easily enough at my table for an undead ( revenant ) character . 
  there also exists a bard feature , the healer master feat that turns healers ' kits into things that actually heal , and i recall at least one other thing which came up at my table at our last session , but which i have forgotten . 
  the main point , though , is that it 's not nearly as big a hindrance as you think . 
  and this brings the additional problem that there is no * consequence * for not feeding . 
  yes , they can regain some hit points if they * do * feed , but normally there would be some * penalty * for not doing so . 
  you have a first level feature which enables your player to summon a cr 5 creature . 
  in fact , not just one cr 5 creature , ** unlimited ** cr 5 creatures !, 
  you have a second level feature which allows * virtually unlimited * use of a first level spell . 
  * charm person * might not be as powerful as * suggestion * , but it is still undoubtedly an insanely abusable spell in the wrong hands . 
  just because you have n't seen it used , does n't mean it ca n't be . 
  perhaps the dms at your table were overly strict on roleplay-related stuff . 
  perhaps the players were less creative . 
  it also does * not * require concentration , so you can have many going at once . 
  you could use all five at once !, 
  charm a king and all his senior advisors !, 
  vampires in lore have always needed sleep . 
  yes , a long rest would still be required by your version , but my complaint here is one of flavour , not mechanics . 
  i 'm fine with classes/races not needing sleep . 
  i 'm not fine with * vampires * not needing it . 
  dracula needed sleep . 
  darren shan & mr crepsley needed sleep , serana & the volkihar vampires need sleep , the vampires in buffy the vampire slayer and true blood need sleep . 
  the d&d vampires do n't specifically say they need sleep , but they do say that they need to `` rest by day '' at `` its coffin , crypt , or grave site '' . 
  i feel that , in this case , `` rest '' is * implied * to mean sleep ; it does n't say otherwise , after all . 
  a restriction that would be even more penalising than simply needing to sleep . 
  ( the workaround they provide for this feels both cheap and cheesy , and would be doubly so if the player were lugging around some of that earth * all the time * , rather than doing what most d&d vampires apparently do , and setting up multiple * permanent * resting places . ), 
  the only significant vampire lore i could find in my search that * did n't * require sleep is freaking * twilight * . 
  as for the art , feel free to borrow art you 've found in other places . 
  just make sure you give them appropriate credit . 
  try and use creative commons or other permissively licensed material if you can , but we do n't strictly * require * that here . 
  most of our creators are not artists !, 
  [ here is a very quick search ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1150&amp;bih=652&amp;q=vampire&amp;btng=search+images&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=deniz+akdeniz&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=dlhhwmd_jyyx8qx3_pwobq#q=vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=sur:fmc&amp;tbm=isch&amp;* ) of stuff that has been * explicitly * marked available for reuse by the uploaders . 
  and you can probably find a lot more if you search sites like deviantart , and ask creators around there . 
  but i 'm mainly drawn back to how insanely powerful this is . 
  5 free charms . 
  unlimited super powerful minions . 
  a bunch of super powerful subclass options . 
  there 's just far , far too much going on , too early . 
  that 's a pretty shitty attitude to take , considering how large the rainbow road is . 
   consider that the cdc found that , between nov 2000 to oct 2004 , paracetamol ( acetaminophen/tylenol in the us ) was responsible for 41 % of acute liver failure cases in the us . 
  interesting stat , but how many of these were due to incorrect usage of the drug ? 
  panadol is a great medicine when used carefully , but it 's also well-known for being exceptionally dangerous in high dosage . 
  the other option would be a hiatus over the university exam period . 
  you 'd get the best of both worlds . 
  a comfortable length season with sufficient preparation , as well as maximum capitalisation on the current state of the community . 
  official statement on the matter is basically [ `` eh ? 
  ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/k6vhxtbgcxqqu/giphy.gif ) probably ? '', 
  really , it 's up to your dm , but there 's no good reason * not * to allow it . 
  raw , extra attack and coordinated attack stack as someotherrandom suggests . 
  what i suspect is rai , and definitely how i would rule it if it came up at my table , is that coordinated attack and extra attack interact in the way various different ac calculating formula interact : player chooses which one to use at any given time . 
  they can use either extra attack or coordinated attack on any turn , but not both . 
  well fuck me . 
  i always knew there were similarities , but literally just swap out maori for aboriginal and jandals for thongs , and you 've literally just described australia . 
  did n't realise it was quite * that * similar . 
  to op , i 'm just going to clarify , * yes * , we call * everything * you call sweets `` lollies '' . 
  what you call `` lollies '' are `` lolli * pops * '' to us . 
  that 's one i 've seen trip up brits before . 
  i 'm not a kiwi , but i reckon i 've got good odds that one would back me up on this . 
  make sure you know the rules to rugby union . 
   i just realized . 
  from my point of view the jedi are evil . 
  hahaha . 
  the problem with that line is not and never was the meaning behind it . 
  it 's actually * incredibly * profound . 
  the problem is that it 's basically the ultimate example of * not * following `` show , do n't tell '' . 
  so do n't beat yourself up too bad for agreeing with annie on that one . 
  just maybe paraphrase him rather than directly quoting :p, 
  each individual time is a 50/50 chance , sure . 
  but the chance at the outset of that happening is less than 1 % . 
  it 's certainly * possible * ( i wonder how many people play m&b with that particular tweak ? 
  enough to make it probable that a fair few people have experienced a streak like this ? ), 
  that something like that would occur . 
  but i do still wonder if maybe the m&b tweak guys have got their coding wrong somehow , or maybe an update caused a bug or something . 
   swimmers vs. togs, 
  you put the aussie one first on all the others , so i have to assume that 's what you 're doing here too . 
  the preferred term in australia differs quite a lot by region , but in queensland where i 'm from , togs is the most common word . 
   baby seal ( i think ) vs. fluffy ( frothed milk drink for children at a cafe ), 
  never heard of either of those in my life . 
  the reason i asked is that in my mind there 's a very big difference between the effects that could come with proper usage of a drug , and possible effects of improper usage . 
  if i 'm deciding what i should take for my condition , i know i can trust myself to take it properly , report any other medicines i might be taking , etc. , so i feel fairly safely that i 'm not going to suffer effects from improper usage . 
  so i 'd mostly discount those from my decision . 
  yeah i was expecting to wake up to a new article . 
  have there been any tweets or other statements that there wo n't be one this week ? 
  yeah , but why would you * ever * use nano when vim is * just as easy * for the small things , if not * easier * , once you 're more than vaguely familiar with it . 
  after i had used vim for like 40 minutes i knew i 'd never use another command line text editor again . 
  turns out that [ yes , there is going to be one later today !, 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/wizards_dnd/status/848982575989354496 ), 
   there is also a ua that was released a while ago about creating new classes, 
  are you sure you were n't thinking of the [ modifying classes ua ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/modifying-classes ) ? 
  that 's the only similar one i can think of . 
  there 's also the [ feats ua ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/dnd/ua-feats-v1.pdf ) , which in addition to providing a bunch of new feats , has some discussion about what makes a good feat versus a bad one . 
  everything about submarines is fucking terrifying . 
  even worse if you consider it during war or the cold war . 
  crazy deep under the ocean ? 
  check . 
  closed in a tight some with the same people for months ? 
  yup . 
  who knows what sort of bizarre scary creatures are outside ?
