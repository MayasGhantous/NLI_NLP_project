  i dunno , maybe your campaigns are much more combat heavy than mine . 
  i tend to focus on roleplay and story . 
  but combat does happen , and it 's frequently near deadly , and yet still despite that , my party 's undead cleric is able to survive mostly thanks to hit dice alone . 
  you do n't need to add in an enormous amount of extra healing to make them viable . 
  buffy vampires do in fact seem to need to sleep , at least from my research . 
  i watched some of shadow hunters , but it was terrible teenage shite so i stopped after a handful of episodes . 
  i do n't recall them specifically * not * needing sleep though , and googling just now i could n't find an answer as to whether they need to . 
  but anyway , i used the word `` significant '' for a reason . 
  i do n't care if some shitty netflix show 's vampires need sleep or not , when the most famous and culturally significant incarnations of the beasts do . 
  the 5e `` long rest '' mechanic does not require sleep . 
  but this does not mean that , with the `` natural language '' approach 5e takes , that every non-mechanical mention of the word `` rest '' necessarily is not about sleep . 
  the vampire 's description in the monster manual is not clear on this front , and thus can not be used one way or the other to determine whether vampires need to sleep . 
  and really , why are you even * trying * to bring real-world diseases into this ? 
  vampires in mythology have * nothing * to do with real diseases . 
  but since you did , neither [ clinical vampirism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clinical_vampirism ) nor [ porphyria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porphyria ) have anything to do with sleep . 
  so even if you were going to try and use something from the real world to justify your argument , it would n't help . 
   as for charms , i wonder ... how often did your wizard level 1 cast his cr 5 creatures to his aid ? 
  huh ? 
  the charm thing and the cr 5 creature are not the same problem . 
  being able to summon a vampire spawn under your control is a problem that is entirely separate from the virtually unlimited use of a first level spell . 
  but regarding the charm thing , the problem is that * charm person * is quite a powerful spell . 
  it 's not * suggestion * , and it 's * certainly * not * dominate person * , but it 's not a shitty useless spell like * feather fall * , either . 
  the biggest thing it lets you do is lie to someone far more convincingly . 
  if you want them to act as though a certain thing is true when it is n't , being your friendly acquaintance is going to help with that a * lot * . 
  granting free use like this is ridiculous . 
  if you are n't going to be bothered to listen to feedback , frankly you are not welcome on this subreddit . 
  because taking feedback and improving your work is what we are about at / r/unearthedarcana . 
  you 're * certainly * not welcome here if you 're going to be making unfounded assumptions about the people trying to help you , or acting all high and mighty as though you know everything about this game . 
  you are free to do whatever you want in your home games . 
  but if you 're sharing homebrew with the world , you need to expect it to be treated as homebrew available for the world . 
  that means it has to be balanced in and of itself , and not dependent on the specific circumstances of your home game . 
  what you have here is not even close to that . 
  mate , i 'd * really * appreciate if you came back and gave this at least a really brief review . 
  maybe some more people pointing out the problems with this class would help the guy see the flaws in his work . 
  in most situations , that 's going to be enough . 
  you can literally never get lost . 
  you always know what way you need to end up , even if you ca n't go by the most direct route . 
  the only place where that restriction is going to make any substantial * difference * is in a maze , or a maze-like structure ( such as a dungeon complex ) . 
   it 's the same damage as chromatic orb except with a massive upside of the possibility of it jumping to a second target . 
  same damage , with the downside of not * choosing * your damage type , and the upside of a ~ 25.78 % \\* chance of hitting a second target . 
  it 's hard to say whether or not that would be properly balanced , but probably not . 
  if something has damage * resistance * to only one or two types , * chaos bolt * is almost always going to enable you to bypass that resistance , since you can choose between three . 
  on the other hand , if you 're trying to target a damage * vulnerability * , you 're most often * not * going to be able to succeed on it like you would with * chromatic orb * . 
  it seems to me that that makes * chaos bolt * clearly the superior choice if it was 3d8 . 
  so , what if instead , it were made 3d6 ? 
  get rid of psychic ( kinda never made sense anyway ) and either thunder or force ( i initially was going to say thunder , because to me it makes the second least amount of sense , but then i checked * chromatic orb * , which has thunder but not force ) damage options . 
  with 3d6 you 've got a 30 % chance of jumping , but you 're also doing only 10.5 damage on average , compared to 13.5 ( max 18 compared to 24 ) . 
  if we assume a 70 % chance of hitting , with 3d6 your expected damage output ( assuming the first attack hits , and ignoring crits ) is 15.24 . 
  with 3d8 it 's at 17.78 -- higher , but the percentage gap closes because of the reduced chance of jumping . 
  with 2d8 , you get only 9.86 damage on average , however , which is pretty pitiful really . \u2020, 
  so , personally , after doing that maths , it 's pretty clear that 3d8 is crazy good . 
  you 'd be doing almost a third as much again as compared to * chromatic orb * . 
  even 3d6 is going to be superior to * chromatic orb * 's 13.5 output , but you pay for this a little with the fairly high chance of doing much less than that ( it 's going to be a very swingy spell ) , and the reduced control over the damage * type * . 
  crits are worth taking into account however . 
  with this , crits are going to be * super * effective , since on 3d6 a crit all but * guarantees * a jump ( 98.5 % chance of a jump with 6d6 ) . 
  the calculation on a crit is much harder to do , especially for a spell like this , so i 'm not going to , but suffice it to say that even with 3d6 ( rather than 3d8 ) , it 's clearly a better option than * chromatic orb * , unless you place a very high value on choosing your damage type . 
  another option would be to do 2d8 + spellcasting modifier . 
  if we assume that 's going to be +3 at first level , your expected damage each time you use the spell becomes 13.15 , only slightly less than * chromatic orb * . 
  i think that might be the best option of all . 
  and of course , as your modifier increases over time , the damage of this spell will also increase . 
  when your modifier is +5 , the expected value of your damage is 15.34 . 
  very high , but should n't be happening until at * least * 4th level , but in many cases 8th level , when you have access to * much * stronger options anyway . 
  consider also that * chromatic orb * scales using 1d8 , while * chaos bolt * only scales with 1d6 . 
  another option is to ignore the values of the dice for a jump , and to use a coin toss ( like 4e apparently did ) . 
  with that , you get 14.28 damage . 
  equivalently , if the total damage rolled is even , jump , if it 's odd , do n't . 
  or , if you add in radiant as a damage option , and one more for a wildcard , and use 2d10 , you get 11.83 . 
  quite a bit weaker than * chromatic orb * , but in a range that might make it more acceptable than 2d8 did . 
  the question then becomes whether to scale it with 1d8 or 1d10 . 
  here 's the above , in a table sorted by damage :, 
  damage type | expected value of damage, 
  chromatic orb ( 3d8 , no rerolls ) | 13.5, 
  2d8 using coin toss for jumps | 14.28, 
  \\* specifically , with 3d8 you have a 1 -- ( 7/8 ) ( 6/8 ) chance of jumping . 
  then i assumed a 3/4 chance of hitting . 
  the chance of jumping with a successful hit drops to as low as 17.19 % if you assume a 1/2 chance of hitting . 
  the chance of a double is 1 -- ( 5/6 ) ( 4/6 ) , or 4/9 . 
  add to that the chance of * hitting * as 7/10 , and you get 14/45 . 
  you do an average of 10.5 damage each time you hit . 
  the chance of a double is 1 -- ( 7/8 ) ( 6/8 ) , or 11/32 . 
  add to that the chance of hitting as 7/10 , and you get 77/320 . 
  you do an average of 13.5 damage each time you hit . 
  you 're now doing 12 damage on average each time you hit . 
  2d8 with coin toss jumps :, 
  0.5 chance of a jump , and 0.7 chance of a hit , gives 0.35 chance of a jump that hits . 
  is it ? 
  i just vaguely remember reading an angry dm article where he mentioned it was around 70 -- 75 % . 
  i added my formulae in there so you can redo the calculations yourself if you want . 
  70 % , which is what i used , means you 'll hit if you roll a 7 or more . 
  66 % is either hit on an 8 ( if you round to the * nearest * integer ) or 7 ( if you round * up * , since a near miss is still a miss ) . 
  in truth , calculating hit chance precisely seems like it 'd be fairly difficult . 
  you 've got ta figure out what the stats of a player are at any given point , what different monsters they 'd be facing and with what frequency , as well as what their acs are . 
  it 's not really something you can know . 
  i redid the calculations after realising i had made a * different * mistake , but forgot to do this bit correctly the second time around ... all of those ( 7/8 ) should be ( 7/8 ) \\* ( 6/7 ) , and similar with the 5/6 . 
  give me a moment and i 'll edit in the correct value . 
  edit :, 
  this is in response to your deleted comment :, 
  for 3d6 to have one double , the first roll we can ignore . 
  the second roll ca n't be the same as the first , so it has 5/6 chance of not being a double . 
  the third ca n't match either of the previous two , so it has a 4/6 chance of * not * being a double .
