  more likely is level 8 , at which point you 've got access to level 3 and 4 spells , including * fireball * . 
  even level 4 is only one level away from third level spells . 
   hand of radiance : really standard damage cantrip, 
  not standard at all . 
  it 's an aoe affecting all enemies within reach of you . 
  otherwise , i pretty much agree with you across the board . 
  you might want to x-post this to / r/despirepath . 
  it 's a larger subreddit . 
  i liked the * idea * of olicity . 
  i was a fan of it during season 2 and early 3 . 
  to me , the problem was with how it was handled . 
  and it was handled truly * awfully * . 
  this season has , on the whole , been a lot stronger than seasons 3.5 and 4 were , so i have cautious hope that this might be done well . 
  very , * very * cautious hope . 
  part of the reason , imo , that this season has improved over the last one is because of a comparative * lack * of the romance stuff . 
  basically , * if * they handle this well , i 'll be really glad . 
  but i doubt they will . 
  my group also rolls for stats and so most of the time characters have an 18 , but they also most often take a feat instead . 
  in fact , a big part of the reason i * like * rolling is that it allows you to feel comfortable taking a feat earlier . 
  that , plus the fact that with point buy characters it is * impossible * to reach 20 at level 4 leaves me stating that it 's relatively uncommon to reach 20 that early . 
  huh ? 
  gotham is n't back until the 24th . 
  i 'm guessing the sewers are like dragon age 's fade ? 
  if you see [ this comment , where i did the maths ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 63anvj/unearthed _ arcana_03042017_starter_spells / dfsv6qz / ) , you 'll see that 2d10 is actually rather underpowered even without dropping the die as it jumps . 
  oh right . 
  so it 's not that it 's dull , it 's that it 's hard ? 
   you did include chance to hit , but at 70 %, 
  what value would you have preferred ? 
  70 % means you need to roll a 7 or higher to succeed . 
  at level one , with +3 ability score and +2 prof , that means an ac of 12 , which seems about right to me . 
  and for what it 's worth , i did n't take into account how this would scale with higher spell slots * at all * . 
  this was purely an analysis of first level spells . 
  not many 1st level spells with a 1st level spell slot can compete with cantrips at level 11 , and many suffer even when compared to 5th level cantrips . 
  ( for example , 2d10 competes rather well with 3d8 , and easily beats 1d12 . ), 
  one thing i like about the option of using a coin toss for jumping is that it means you can switch to using 1d8 for scaling , which brings it a little more in line with where it seems like it should be , because in this case using an extra d8 does n't cause an * enormous * increase in the damage output . 
  the way the thing is written officially , the chance to jump results in a measly 0.84 extra damage per use on average . 
  so i definitely agree with you that it 's just way too weak . 
  but using the coin toss method , a first level version of the spell does an extra 5.28 damage per use , which makes it stronger than * chromatic orb * , which as far as i know , nobody considers an especially weak spell . 
  doing it this way , even if you scaled using 1d6 , it would still be stronger than co on a 2nd level slot , and probably also on a 3rd level one . 
  very nice map . 
  this is , imo , the sort of map that the new version of inkarnate is designed to do , and it does them very well . 
  much more zoomed in looks at a relatively small area . 
  it does n't do well with continents any more , but it does this sort of thing * beautifully * , and you 've taken perfect advantage of that . 
  i really like your delta and lower river , particularly everything north of frendor . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  gotham ca n't be `` the best ... show on tv '' if it 's not on tv for almost another month !, 
  ( also not in contention , because it wo n't be back for ** ages ** , even though it is ** clearly ** the winner , is young justice . ), 
   in any case even if they require you to have the alchemist 's supplies , remember that spell components are not expended unless the spell specifically say so , it 's just one time cost . 
  yeah that 's fine . 
  for me it 's a flavour thing . 
  i think it 's kinda dumb to create a healing potion out of nowhere using a magic wand . 
  i like the idea of flavouring it as just really quickly working with the alchemist 's supplies . 
  hey , your link currently does n't work . 
  i 'm removing this post , but i 'll put it back up once you fix the link and let me know it 's fixed . 
  also remember to flair your post !, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  yup , working now , cheers . 
  my recommendation is [ the vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) at / r/boh5e . 
  it lets their vampiric powers increase over time by them investing levels in it , rather than in their normal class . 
  you can give them the basic benefits and flaws from child of the night immediately , and let them get more vampire powers asthma choose , by levelling up . 
  if you 're not familiar with / r/boh5e , it 's a highly curated subreddit with a selection of only the very best homebrew out there . 
  and this vampire is among the best there is even within that group . 
  i would go so far as to say it 's possibly the best homebrew there is in the game . 
  edit : lol stupid phone autocorrect . 
  give them more asthma !, 
  no , `` more vampire powers * as they * choose , that should say . 
   the `` recount '' will just be a button click . 
  now if only the counting software they used were open source . 
  but apparently asking them to make it so makes you a vexatious litigant . 
  wait , demon shaft ? 
  you mean there 's something left to do * after * killing the dark genie ? 
  i have n't played since i was a kid and i never managed to beat the damn guy , but i always thought i was * this * close to finishing the whole game . 
   the only way to really create a ww is by making it a class . 
  anything else and will probably be too powerful, 
  well , the other ( and perhaps even more obvious ) option would be a prestige class . 
   should this be used as a class or a prestige class ? 
  what you 've presented us is a good start for a full class . 
  but if you want it to be a full class , you 'll need to make another 9 levels before you can consider it `` complete '' . 
  because while prestige classes have the luxury of being shorter than 20 levels , if it 's a full class , it needs to go the whole way . 
  personally , i think it works better as a prestige class in both concept and execution . 
  you can allow it to be played from the beginning if you * really * want , but as a concept it makes more sense being a shorter specialisation rather than a full 1 -- 20 progression . 
  is n't 3 what they 've already had ? 
  at least if you count adventures ( which personally , honestly , i do n't ) . 
  one early in the year , one late , plus a source book ( scag two years ago , volo 's last year ) late in the year . 
  no no , i agree with you there . 
  presenting it in this form for now is fine . 
  i was mainly worried that op would leave it like that , which would be wrong . 
  skt and cos were 2016 , oota and pota were 2015 . 
  you can also get flair by including information in your title that allows automod to flair it for you , like `` race '' if it 's a race , or `` school of '' if it 's a subclass . 
  or , if you leave a comment with the name of the flair in square brackets , like [ race ] , it 'll also autoflair for you . 
  yeah i really like that little bit of design . 
  for what it 's worth , [ i was not speaking hypothetically ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 29t8hs/the _ aec_moves_to_have_mjec_declared_a_vexatious / ) . 
  edit : i should clarify though , i made a mistake when i said he was asking for it to be made open source . 
  he was merely asking that the source code be publicly visible . 
  not quite the same thing . 
  you can find a comment elswhere in this thread where i explain the maths of a * bunch * of other options and how they compare to * chromatic orb * . 
  i 'm only discussing how they work with 1st level spell slots , so not how they scale , but i think it 's quite useful for comparing how it 'll scale as well . 
  the main thing is that currently it 's way , * way * worse than chromatic orb in terms of damage output . 
  changing it to either + cha damage , or to jump with a probability of 1/2 instead of 1/8 , makes it much more reasonably balanced .
