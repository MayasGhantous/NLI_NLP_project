  * in a minor key * . 
   no matter how many [ expert musician ] videos one watches , the video ca n't say `` no you 're [ doing the technique ] wrong . '', 
  they can only demonstrate the right way . 
  they ca n't see you play and suggest [ how to improve your technique ], 
  this is honestly super important and applicable for anyone learning * any * instrument , * especially * for the first year or so ( and even after then , if you want to be * good * , rather than passable ) . 
  having a real teacher , even one that 's not much better than mediocre , is still going to be so much more useful than the best online resources in the world . 
  fuck that 's a good deal . 
  everyone is saying you need to practise , and they 're not wrong . 
  but it 's also important to remember : practice * does not * make perfect . 
  perfect practice makes perfect . 
  a teacher can help you learn how to practise properly , in addition to learning the fundamentals and correcting any errors that might pop up . 
  i had a proper out loud belly laugh at that . 
   the wording stating that you choose a spell `` you have prepared '' means that by raw interpretation the investiture option is useless to warlocks without multiclassing, 
  i 'm torn on whether or not this is correct , to be honest . 
  it 's how i 'm choosing to interpret investiture for now at my table ( as dm ) , just to err on the safe side , but at heart i do n't think it 's necessarily true . 
  * glyph of warding * 's *** spell glyph *** option says `` you can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower '' , i.e. , it 's basically the same restriction on prepared spells . 
  but it 's on the bard 's spell list , and bards do n't prepare spells . 
  now , * maybe * bards have the same restriction on that spell as people are arguing warlocks ( or the other many ways of getting * ceremony * without being a cleric ) should have with * ceremony * , but i 'm a little doubtful about that . 
  anyway , i 'd be really interested to see an official clarification on the matter . 
   the wording on investiture is pretty clear , you have to have the spell prepared,

   i honestly expcted the door to slam shut on his leg , causing a compound fracture, 
  wow dude , you are * sharp * . 
  careful , you could puncture the hull of an empire-class fire nation battle ship , leaving thousands to drown at sea . 
  because ... you 're so sharp . 
  i am completely with you on apple , grey , as far as being only in the last couple of years starting to agree with the neigh sayers . 
  literally all i want from them is for them to just keep making the 2012 macbook pro 15 inch , non retina , but update the internal specs over time . 
  not particularly high expectations . 
  but everything they 've done to the mac line since then has made me less and less interested in making my next laptop a mac . 
  i love the fact that it 's a robust user-friendly operating system ( unlike linux ) with a unix underpinning ( unlike windows ) . 
  i love so much of the apple-exclusive software , most notably finalcut pro . 
  i love having the `` dvorak-qwerty \u2318 '' keyboard layout letting me use \u2318 c in the same way as on qwerty , but type normally on dvorak . 
  plus the way the operating system interacts with apple 's amazing touchpad . 
  but i also want a reasonably priced computer with high end specs . 
  i know the apple haters think this is a laughable assertion , but the difference between the specs on my 2012 non-retina mbp and what you 'd get for the same price * today * ( adjusting for spec inflation in the 4.5 years since ) is ridiculous . 
  they 're nowhere near as good today as they used to be . 
  i got mine for ~ $ 2200 aud . 
  to get a laptop with a discrete graphics card today is all the way up at $ 3600 . 
  that 's * not * a typo . 
  regarding the mac pro , i 'm assuming this was recorded before the recent announcement that they * are * indeed working on a new mac pro that 's aimed at actually pleasing the professionals in a way the `` trash can '' does n't ? 
  it seemed not to be aware of that announcement , anyway . 
  i just hope they take the same attitude towards mac * book * pros in the next couple of years . 
   having to cough up 500 dollars or more a semester, 
  holy shit ouch . 
  i am so glad that in my degree the most a textbook has ever been is `` recommended '' , except in a couple of cases where it 's readily available online anyway . 
  do n't get used to it . 
  i had the main video show up in my feed , but it was under a different title than the one i got in a notification and here on reddit . 
  it also appeared * more recently * in my feed than the footnotes . 
  not sure if that 's what was happening to you though . 
  a little while ago youtube preroll ads were showing me a thumbs up/down button to rate the * ads * , presumably as part of their decision making process . 
  i really liked that because there are some ads that i get that are so painfully terrible , it 's nice to be able to do something that says `` yes , this is terrible '' . 
  it never seemed to change anything in terms of what ads i saw , though . 
  wait , so if i watch an ad all the way through that makes the ad more likely to show up not just for me , but for others ? 
  damn , sometimes i leave the * worst * ads to play all the way through while muted just because i hate them so much i want the advertiser to have to pay , since i already knew about the `` the do n't pay if you skip it '' part . 
  guess i should stop doing that . 
  oh , so when creators state their ad rates , they 're * not * looking at the value the adsense interface states ? 
  that explains * so much * . 
  i had always wondered why the rate my adsense says is so much higher than what i hear most creators talk about . 
  i had always put it down to an oddity due to the * tiny * size of my channel . 
  sort of like how outliers ca n't get normalised in a small sample size when doing a statistical analysis of data . 
  did n't realise i was n't looking at the same number they were . 
  i ca n't remember what / u/mjec 's reasons for the foi request were , but personally i mainly think the source should be publicly visible on principle . 
  software used in the running of our elections should be available to the public precisely because it 's involved in the running of elections , even if it does n't `` matter '' from a pragmatic standpoint . 
  in case you 're serious , brady haran is another youtube creator . 
  he makes videos on the [ numberphile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile ) , [ sixty symbols ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols ) , and [ objectivity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uctwkon9qmt5ylvgqt1tvjkg ) channels ( among others ) , as well as being the owner of [ computerphile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/computerphile ) . 
  he also cohosts the [ hello internet podcast ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/hellointernetpodcast ) with grey , which you should definitely check out if you 're a fan of either of them . 
  as someone who always goes to the * bottom * of my feed first , so that i can watch the chronologically , this is * infuriating * . 
  he needs to go back and edit anyway , since the footnotes videos link back to the main one . 
  it was actually really terrible , because real overlay ads appear at 10 seconds in , and he did that gag at 5 seconds . 
  i 've always found it odd that you consider them worse than prerolls . 
  as a viewer , i would prefer an overlay ad to a preroll * any * day . 
   i keep getting the same skippable ads over and over and i frequently skip them because they are annoying me or i am clearly not the intended demographic, 
  oh fucking gods yes . 
  `` you need a website , why do n't you do it yourself . '', 
  thanks for the tip . 
  unfortunately , ** your product is not doing it yourself ** . 
  also `` let 's suppose that you 're writing a really important email to a colleague . '', 
  okay , let 's . 
  it 's written well , because i am not in fifth grade . 
  thanks . 
  supposing over . 
  sorry ... those two ads i just see * so * much , and they 're so fucking annoying . 
  before seeing this video , i sometimes muted and watched them the whole way through , just to make them pay money because i want them wasting their money ( plus to give the creator of the video on which the ad appears to get a share ) . 
  i wo n't be doing that anymore , since now i know that ad watch time is part of the ad auction algorithm . 
  well , it was literally 100 % out . 
  that 's pretty much the opposite of `` perfect '' timing . 
  i do n't make a conscious effort to do it , but i 've ended up in a multi-os life too . 
  mac laptop , but occasionally boot it into windows for gaming . 
  windows/linux desktop , depending on what i need at the time , android phone . 
   it does little more than keeping 1st level clerics from casting the spell, 
  i believe that 's kinda the point . 
  certainly * chromatic orb * , another 1st level spell with a non-consumed material component , seems to only have it either ( a ) for history 's sake or ( b ) to keep 1st level characters from using it . 
  same with * identify * . 
  in terms of flavour , i think it makes a lot of sense for * chromatic orb * not to consume the element , since the diamond itself acts as a sort of specialised focus . 
  similarly , * leomund 's secret chest * makes sense not to expend the component .
