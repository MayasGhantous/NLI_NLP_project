  a lot of other ones are a bit harder to understand though , including * ceremony * . 
  i 'm not talking about youtub red in any way . 
  i 'm talking about how the ad auction system works . 
  ( unless we could get the bot to link to top of the last month , or even better , to link to the current stickied posts . ), 
   you 're pretty much just spamming `` here , check out the biggest dramas in these subs ! '', 
  eh , it kinda depends on the subreddit . 
  unearthedarcana is opting itself out because its `` top posts '' are jokes and completely unrepresentative of the normal content . 
  but dndgreentext and boh5e are both staying in , because their tops are pretty decent examples of what you can expect to find . 
  not necessarily the true best of the best , but at least solid quality , representative stuff . 
   the money is given back to you in the same form you bought it in ie back on your credit card if you paid with that , cash back if you bought in cash , or back on your gift card in your case, 
  this is all that 's required * by law * , but they are allowed to * offer * it in a different form if they want , and you 're allowed to accept it . 
  for example , it 's not illegal for them to offer you a gift card if you paid for something in cash . 
  be careful if you do though , because if you accept a gift card when returning something that you paid for in cash , you ca n't trade it back up to cash . 
  not really applicable in this case , but worth knowing to be an educated consumer anyway . 
  i agree with / u/heardtherewasgirls . 
  it 's a really easy course if you 've already got programming experience in general , let alone with python specifically . 
  take it for a fairly easy 7 if you want to ; otherwise , give it a miss . 
  this is most definitively * not * true , as demonstrated by the fact that many , many people have backed ( or `` bought '' , as you put it ) things on kickstarter , but never received the product they supposedly paid for , because the product ended up not being created . 
  it very clearly * is * some form of low-key investment in the company , and not the purchase of a product . 
  i 've always found the way the hand rests in ab and db most comfortable . 
  especially for triads , where the middle finger sits down on white while 1 and 5 sit on black notes . 
  going over his history , it seems that apparently [ the data entry and export is part of the same system as the one used to count votes ] ( / r/australia/comments / 4ovjum/a _ three_word_slogan / d4gcprb / ? context = 3 ) . 
  so not having the software available means that , while we might be able to check that the results were correct based on the exported votes , we do n't have a way to check that votes are being exported correctly based on the physical ballots cast .

  yeah that too . 
  i also quite like two lower black keys and a white key , such as c #m second inversion . 
  that just feels like a really natural hand position .

  i do n't particularly like this , to be honest , because i think it misses the point of the marriage effects in the * ceremony * spell . 
  * ceremony * 's marriage effects are n't caused by the marriage itself , they 're blessings from the officiant to provide the couple with good luck on their wedding day . 
  allowing them this sort of weird insight into each other permanently really just does n't make any sense .

  i do n't hate it . 
  i do n't even understand why people * would * hate it . 
  literally all it does is change from a 5 point rating system to a 2 point one for how you rate something , and from a 5 point system to a percentage one for how they recommend things . 
  the star recommendations previously were not actual ratings , but recommendations , and so now they 're showing how much they recommend things to you as a percentage instead of a star rating one . 
  [ youtube showed their data a long time ago on how people use 5 star rating systems ] ( https://youtube.googleblog.com/2009/09/five-stars-dominate-ratings.html ) . 
  a lot of 5 star ratings , quite a few 1 star , and shit all in between . 
  people just do n't use 5 star systems when they 're rating something , they use a simple `` good '' or `` bad '' one . 
  netflix is just making a change reflecting what google learnt in 2009 . 
   i do n't care for star rating systems when it 's left to the general public . 
  people have different reference points for what is supposed to be five stars . 
  this is one huge problem i have with uber . 
  if i did n't know about how their system works behind the scenes , and i were an uber user ( i 'm not -- i actually do n't have a need for any taxi-like service , so i do n't use uber or its competitors ) , i would probably rate most drivers 4 stars , because that 's my `` it was good '' baseline . 
  i give out 4 stars very easily , but i 'm extremely harsh on 5 stars . 
  with uber , a 4 star is a failing grade . 
  if a driver got all 4 stars , they 'd be kicked out of the system . 
  4 stars is * good * , it should n't function like that . 
  this is the real problem . 
  everyone 's getting all outraged over the switch from a 5 star system for both your own ratings and your recommendations , to a thumbs up/down for your ratings and percentage for recommendations . 
  * that * change is literally nothing but a good thing . 
  but their algorithm for recommendations is now , and has always been , utter crap . 
  and * that 's * worth getting angry about . 
   up or down is not a descriptive enough value for me to decide if i want to watch it, 
  well good news !, 
  they now give you a full 100 point system for deciding whether or not they think you 'll like something . 
  it used to be only a 10 point system ( 5 stars with half stars ) , so if you like granularity , you 've now got it !, 
  thumbs up or down [ is what the data suggests people usually use in online rating systems ] ( https://youtube.googleblog.com/2009/09/five-stars-dominate-ratings.html ) , even if they 're given 5 stars to work with . 
   now they do n't even tell you what percentage liked it before watching it, 
  so , just like before ? 
  they give you a recommendation of how much their algorithms think you 'll like it . 
  the algorithms are * far * from perfect , but the type of information you 're being shown now is * exactly the same * as the type of information they used to tell you . 
  all this anger everyone seems to have over the change to how they present the information makes literally no sense . 
  get angry about the bad algorithm , not about how the results of the algorithm are presented . 
  i spent so much time trying to find it to download it back around 2010/11 . 
  season 3 onwards the video quality of my download was so crap i just gave up on it . 
  will be awesome to finally revisit and finish the show !, 
  you ca n't [ have a trebutchet made out of pvc in your backyard ] ( / r/auslaw/comments / 266dd7/owning _ a_ballista / ) . 
  i would recommend making the deck used one that is easily compatible with a real deck of cards . 
  that means making it so that there are 13 options , which can be translated to 2 -- 10 , jack , queen , king , and ace . 
  unless one of these is supposed to come up much less frequently than the others ( in which case it can be the joker ) , it 'd be easier if you removed one of the options . 
  does n't really matter which . 
   for people who used the five star system properly , the predictions were highly accurate , * weirdly * accurate , even,
