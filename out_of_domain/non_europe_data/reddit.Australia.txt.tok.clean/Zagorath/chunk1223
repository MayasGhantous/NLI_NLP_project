  eh , that was definitely never my experience . 
  netflix 's recommendations have always been pretty poor for me , telling me i 'd like stuff that 's i 've already told them i rate 1 star . 
   if it would be recommendations it would be nice . 
  that would mean imho that 2-3 star ratings previously would be 30-40 % recommendations and 4-5 start would be 70-90 % . 
  but i have a lot of shows that were 1-2 stars previously are now 90 % recommended . 
  i agree that this is really dumb . 
  but for me at least , it 's exactly the same as it used to be . 
  i 've been `` recommended '' shows that i 've already tried to shop away with 1 star ratings for a long time . 
  your understanding of the old system is wrong . 
  different people would see different ratings for the same show , equate it has always been trying to recommend shows it thinks you would like . 
  and , in my experience , it has always done a poor job of this . 
  i 've been recommended shows that i 've already rated 1 star for ages . 
  worse , actually , since at least on that show there were very real signs that the relationship went both ways . 
  the characters actually did love each other , even if it was poorly written . 
  in this show , the entire point is that ed does n't feel the same way . 
  he is n't even attracted to the same gender as penguin . 
  i mean both of those . 
  i do n't know of anything homebrewery specific , but it uses a combination of markdown and general html/css . 
  most of the time , stuff you would want to do can be done through the menus . 
  you ca n't get a title format the same as the phb that i know of ( unless you can find the font online somewhere and use css to manually use it ) , but you can get a different title format by using the menu to go phb -  cover page . 
  the nap , or non-aggression principle , is a concept in libertarian and ancap ( or anarcho-capitalist ) circles which basically says that you should n't use `` aggression '' for any purposes other than defense against other people 's aggression . 
  on its own , it sounds reasonable , but the people who usually talk about it are on the * crazy * end of the political spectrum , and tend to think of taxation as literal theft at gunpoint and therefore morally unethical and philosophically illegitimate . 
  they 're the sort of people who use phrases like `` am i being detained '' , if you 're familiar with that stereotype . 
  i do n't know this alex jones guy , but i 'm guessing he 's one of these crazy ancap types . 
  but what you just posted a photo of is clearly not a tram . 
  it , like the brisbane metro , clearly runs on wheels that go on a paved surface , and not on dedicated train-like tracks . 
  no , but i can draw seven perpendicular lines . 
  yeah , i figured it was that kind of thing . 
  amusingly , we have our own far-right-wing radio host in australia by the name of al * an * jones . 
  although i do n't think he goes in for the conspiracy theories so much as just far-right + racist ideas . 
   the idea is that the neophite is a joker , then then ace through king is the remaining 13, 
  you should have a little sidebar explaining that , then . 
   what are your thoughts on balance / flavor ? 
  the table should say `` stack the deck improvement '' at levels 3 and 5 , not just `` stack the deck '' . 
  see the monk 's `` unarmored movement improvement '' at level 9 for an example . 
  you used `` loose '' when you meant `` lose '' in the prereqs . 
  i also noticed you said `` tounges '' instead of `` tongues '' . 
  there might be some other typos i did n't notice , so i 'd recommend copying and pasting into a word processor and doing a spelling and grammar check , as well as carefully reading over everything to make sure you got everything right . 
  every time you mention a spell , it should be in italics and * not * capitalised , unless it begins a sentence or with a proper noun . 
  ( so , '' * tasha 's hideous laughter * '' , '' * dissonant whispers * '' , etc. ), 
  currently , you 're really inconsistent with this . 
  sometimes you do it correctly , sometimes you capitalise the first word unnecessarily , sometimes you capitalise multiple words unnecessarily . 
  at least once , you failed to italicise it , and put it in quotes instead ( ` the `` light '' cantrip ' ) . 
  the fate points entry should make a specific reference to the class table to state that you have a number of points mentioned in the table . 
  look at the entry for `` sorcery points '' in the sorcerer class for an example . 
   each card provides an that can be taken advantage of, 
   rearrange the fate, 
  this seems like an extremely weak ability . 
  putting one card back into a deck of 54 cards is still going to have crazy low odds of showing up , and a cost of 2 points for it seems too much . 
  plus , not having an asi or asi-like ability at fourth level is * highly * unusual . 
  now , as for the cards themselves . 
  they could really use some flavour text describing them . 
  what is each of these cards literally , and what do they represent within the world ? 
  that would help me judge whether or not the specific abilities given to each card are a good representation of what 's on the card . 
  in terms of overall balance of the cards , i think it 's probably pretty good . 
  it 's difficult to discuss the balance of something like this , i think , without seeing it in practice . 
  but the fact that the major effects all require expending a spell slot to take advantage of them means i 'd say it 's probably pretty good , with a nice progression as you level up and gain access to more and higher level spell slots . 
  i just think the flavour is dumb . 
  i do n't like the idea of bards as arcane magicians . 
  bardic inspiration is a great ability , and a few of the spells on the bard 's spell list make sense , but a lot of them just do n't , * at all * , fit my idea of what a bard should be . 
  and magical secrets is just about the * worst * possible ability you could give a bard as far as flavour that makes sense , in my view . 
  what i want to see bards do is cast spells that can be explained within lore as coming as a result of musical charms . 
  mostly sleep and persuasive effects , as well as buffs to the party and nerfs to enemies as a result of being inspiring or distracting . 
  basically , if you could n't imagine the pied piper or a similar character being able to do it , i probably do n't want * any * bard being able to do it . 
  4e 's bard was a * fantastic * design and if 5e 's bard felt the same as it , i would have no problem with them . 
   i think the whole music as a casting focus turns people off to it, 
  yup , this is my problem . 
  i just do n't like the range of spellcasting bards have . 
  i do n't mind them casting spells in theory , but i want all their spells to be ones that can be flavoured as purely the result of magically-laced music or speech . 
  putting people to sleep , persuading them to do stuff , inspiring allies , frightening foes . 
  that sort of thing . 
  not * dancing lights * , * thunderwave * , * shatter * , or * sending * , to name just one spell from each of the first few spell levels . 
  and i absolutely * detest * magical secrets as a bardic ability . 
  instead , spells like * vicious mockery * , * sleep * , * enthrall * , and * fear * are great spells for the bard . 
  healing i 'm kinda iffy on , but generally okay with when considering that hp is abstract : confidence and will to go on are parts of it . 
   [ aragorn ] also ... heals, 
  in fairness , aragorn 's healing is just about the most ranger-like healing you could * possibly * get , and not at all what you would expect of a bard . 
  edit : not to mention , you bring up the point that d&d rangers are defined by animal companions and/or magic , but the obvious response to this is that this is itself one of the biggest and most common criticisms of the thematic design of classes in 5e . 
  many people prefer spellless rangers , or at least to reflavour the existing ranger 's spells as non-magical or not explicitly magical abilities . 
  my personal preferred way to play a `` ranger '' in d&d is to multiclass fighter and rogue , with the outlander background . 
   none of your `` bards '' ever do as such, 
  he did mention the ainulindal\u00eb : the creation of the e\u00e4 as presented in the silmarillion , in which it was created through the literal songs of the god-like figures known as the valar . 
  nah , give me the weather two or three weeks ago . 
  that was perfect . 
  this week it 's taken a turn for the worse . 
  it 's already starting to feel like the awful cold of winter in the evenings . 
  divine smite , the class feature , does not require concentration . 
  but there are a bunch of smite spells , such as * searing smite * , which require concentration . 
  not having the right name bothers me a little . 
  but not having her be a * psychiatrist * / therapist / * mental * health professional bothers me a ** lot ** . 
  the idea of her attempting to treat him , all the while being sucked into his world by his manipulations is * so * important to their dynamic . 
  even * suicide squad * , which pissed all over what 's important about the harley/joker dynamic by making them genuinely in love with each other , understood what harley 's origin has to be . 
   i am not including the suicide squad movie because i havent seen it, 
  you made the right choice there . 
  that said , one thing it does right is that it has the correct origin story for harley . 
  she tries to treat him , he ends up `` treating '' her . 
  on the other hand , if you squint at it the right way , you can kinda see where op comes from . 
  in some versions ( i think batman : the animated series is one ) she specifically tries to get put on the joker 's case because she thinks that if she could cure him , it would be amazing for her career . 
  that could also , in theory , be tied to making a great story for her to publish as a novel or similar . 
  i do n't understand .
