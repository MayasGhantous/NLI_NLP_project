  is there something wrong with growing chardonnay in california ? 
  i enjoy making fun of americans doing silly oh-so-american things as much as the next guy , but i can honestly see nothing wrong with this case . 
  there 's a huge and important difference with tas though , and that 's that she was a licensed and trained therapist , who also happened to want the glory that would come with successfully treating an untreatable patient . 
  for someone with ** no ** prior history in the mental health profession , it would n't really make any sense . 
   from both i miss the 5 foot step or the shift , and flanking, 
  fuck yes . 
  i fucking hate the lack of these in 5e . 
  i 've tried so many different methods of bringing them back , and none of them leave me satisfied . 
  it really comes down to the decision to allow a character to literally run circles around an opponent without provoking an opportunity attack . 
  because of this , flanking is too easy to get compared to 3 . x/4 , and thus rewarding it too much is somewhat inadvisable . 
  but * not * rewarding it is unsatisfactory as well , because * it makes fucking sense * . 
  you surround a guy , you take him down more easily . 
  i 've currently arrived at the compromise of having flanking provide a +2 bonus ( instead of advantage ) , and only on enemies that are the same size category as you or smaller . 
  the inability to take literally like , two steps backwards , without provoking an opportunity attack is similarly annoying , but i have n't found any satisfying way to fix it . 
  i tried just saying to my group `` you can spend all of your movement for the turn to move 5 feet away from an opponent '' , but i repeatedly had players misunderstanding how that works , so i ended up just going back to raw . 
  annoying . 
  the fact that it 's the * one * example everyone always points to kind of proves the point , really . 
  so much of the art is beautiful that when there 's one example that 's terrible , it stands out like a sore thumb . 
  the problem i always had was that i could never remember whether a cation was positive , or a cathode was positive . 
  ditto for anions and anodes , with negativity . 
  most of the mnemonics i 've seen to help remember which one is which do n't help with this problem , because cation and cathode have the same prefix . 
  that 's the ultimate `` it 's not a bug , it 's a feature '' claim . 
  if sydney and melbourne were 4 states between them , brisbane would have to have 1 all of its own , and you could probably get a second for the rest of south-east queensland . 
  maybe with a little help from northern nsw . 
  do n't know what moron thought it would be a good idea to make alice the capital of the state , though . 
  we 're not america with their dumb nonsensical tiny state capitals out in the middle of nowhere . 
  the national capital is a slightly different matter for historical reasons , needing to be a compromise between the different states . 
  if we were doing it today , when state identity is far less significant than it was in the 1910s , i doubt canberra would have been necessary , and we probably would have just gone with sydney . 
  fair point . 
  but that 's another reason that the national capital 's selection differs substantially from the state capitals ' . 
  if we were selecting our capital today ? 
  not likely . 
  who are you calling a subrace !, 
  i 'm not a subrace , i 'm a domrace !, 
   i can use the right half of the keyboard on the left half, 
  huh ? 
  could you explain what you mean by this ? 
   copy the color under the cursor in hex, 
  :o do want, 
   i can slugify text with it, 
  but ... why ? 
  out of interest , do you know if autohotkey can be used to :, 
  create a situation on windows that functions similarly to macos 's `` dvorak-qwerty \u2318 '' layout , where it 's dvorak for normal typing , but switches to qwerty while the command ( or in the case of windows , ctrl ) key is held , to make common keyboard shortcuts like \u2318 c , \u2318 v , etc. 
  work the same as on qwerty ? 
  enable [ macos-like alt key functionality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/option_key#alternative_keyboard_input ) ? 
  also is there an ahk equivalent for linux ( debian / ( k ) ubuntu , specifically ) ? 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as this is your second warning , any future unflaired submissions may be removed . 
  backgrounds are formed in a very simple way . 
  ** two ** skill proficiencies , ** two ** languages or two tools or one language and one tool proficiency , a minor roleplay feature , and some equipment . 
  the minor roleplay feature is usually either a group relationship ( such as with a guild or faction ) or a local reputation ( such as with a town or towns ) . 
  there are a couple of minor variations from this , such as the urchin 's ability to navigate around a city with ease , or the charlatan 's ability to forge documents . 
  the biggest variation is the knight 's retainers , and even they are specifically described as performing `` mundane tasks for you '' , and not being useful in a mechanical way . 
  giving proficiency in weapons and armour is * right out * . 
  and features with strong mechanical components are too . 
  blacksmithing and alchemy are probably okay abilities , but could use some rewording to make it clear that it still requires spending a full 8 hours working , just like the standard crafting . 
  alchemic knowledge , wealthy , haggling , healer , and hippocratic oath are all * far * too mechanical . 
  for wealthy , just include a bunch of gold in the background 's equipment . 
  law practice grants * way * too much money . 
  it should really be in the range of 1-10 gp , because that 's more in line with how much people can be expected to make in a day . 
   the northside . 
  flat ... trains are good , buses are not . 
  you what mate ? 
  the entire range from ashgrove to aspley begs to differ on the `` flat '' side of things . 
  ( as do my legs after cycling from st. lucia to stafford heights . ), 
  and maybe it 's just my luck with where i 've been headed , but i 've had nothing but good experiences with the locations of bus routes and their frequency on the north side . 
  i do n't spend an awful lot of time northside these days , but the locations i 've headed to with any amount of frequency have all been within a couple hundred metres of the nearest bus stop with a buz route . 
  nearest train stations are always much further away . 
   when you talk about the trains/buses being good/bad , are you talking about the rarity of the stations/stops ( i.e. 
  how hard it is to be within walking distance ) , their frequency , their comfort/quality , or all 3 ? 
  i honestly do n't know where the guy 's coming from when he says northside busses are bad and trains are good . 
  presumably he means either frequency of timetabling or of stations ( comfort/quality of the busses/trains themselves are pretty uniform across the entire seq ) , but it does not line up with my experience at all . 
  i 've had perfectly fine experiences with busses on the north side , and never had the need for a train station up there . 
  so , what , it 's a digital currency that does n't work using blockchain ? 
  how does it work , then ? 
  well i reckon the double charge of `` pay for delivery + pay a higher price per pizza if delivered '' is pretty unreasonable . 
  should be either a flat fee per pizza , or a simple percentage added to the bill . 
  way more than 20 % better . 
  a +4 on something that you were previously getting a 10 in is a 40 % increase . 
  it 's only 20 % better if you were previously getting exactly 20 . 
  yeah . 
  that means up to +4 , or an increase ( if you were otherwise going to get 10 ) of 40 % . 
  the percentage decreases if what you were getting anyway is higher , and increases if you were going to get lower . 
  if you 're going to use the average , it should be 25 % then . 
  urgh , needlessly complicated skill rules . 
  double urgh , `` you 're not allowed to try this because you 're not proficient '' . 
   but some people like the added rules and realism . 
  op did n't release their fumble table , but in my experience most fumble tables are a ** long ** way away from `` added realism '' . 
  literally * any * chance of doing damage to yourself , except * maybe * for when using a flail , completely destroys any sense of realism . 
  ditto any chance of hurting your allies , except for ranged attacks going in to a melee . 
  weapon breaks are * possible * but far less likely than any fumble table i 've ever seen which includes them -- in 6 years of sport fencing i 've seen maybe two or three breaks happen , and sporting foils are much flimsier blades than * anything * on the d&d weapon list , even the pole weapons or rapier . 
  dropping your weapon is much more likely , but again it 's less common than anything i 've ever seen put into rules in a game . 
  i 'm sure lindybeige has a video on the topic that 's worth watching . 
   i personally would prefer that if you are not proficient , but have tools ... you can try with disadvantage . 
  if you dont have tools , you ca n't try ( even if you are proficient ) , otherwise things go as normal . 
  if it 's the rare check that makes sense to require tools ( picking a lock is literally the only example i can think of right now -- there might be others , but they 're exceedingly rare ) , then you already * do * require tools to do it . 
  if you 're not proficient , you have the disadvantage of not added your proficiency modifier . 
  it makes no sense to double penalise by also adding the disadvantage mechanic on top of that . 
  proficiency * already represents that difference in capability * . 
  not a triple urgh .
