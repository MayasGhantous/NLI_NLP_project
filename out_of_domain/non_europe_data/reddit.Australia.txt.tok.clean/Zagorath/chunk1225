  each section gets its own separate urgh count . 
  the first two are annoying , and get urghs . 
  the last one is super annoying , so it gets a double urgh . 
  my thought was that you were thinking of it as a 20 percentage * point * increase in the probability of you succeeding , which is what that +4 represents . 
  ninja edit : wait , you were n't the same guy i originally replied to . 
  anyway , that 's where i think * they * got the 20 % from . 
  but does n't the spoiler tag do that ? 
  zimmer 's stuff is some of the most dull , generic crap in contemporary film music literature , so if would n't surprise me if something sounded similar . 
  yes , but not for the reason the other commenters are saying ( its length is kinda a bullshit excuse when you consider how much is the `` spell list '' ) . 
  the problem is that it 's good at * everything * . 
  the one i 'm dming for gets free temp hp ** every round ** making him almost as beefy as a barbarian ( except for having less total hp ) . 
  he has better ability to heal others than anyone except a life cleric ( can even heal undead , which all those spells most people get ca n't ) . 
  he can get his movement speed up to like 90 feet quite easily and sustain it for a surprisingly long time . 
  he deals decent damage . 
  and he has the ability to be * incredibly * effective in social situations . 
  they 're just way , * way * more versatile than anyone else . 
  makes it hard to throw challenges at the party . 
  i have literally * never * experienced being dropped prone before . 
  maybe if you were fighting in the woods with roots and stuff to contend with , but on an artificial surface or even just a dirt path , that 's virtually impossible . 
  disadvantage might make sense , depending on how it 's flavoured , but still suffers the problem other people have mentioned of being more penalising to higher level fighters , and making spellcasting more powerful than it already is . 
  it shouldnt display in letter mode if op changed it to a4 . 
  it just displays what the css op entered tells it to . 
  i could set it to landscape a5 folded in half along the longer axis and it should still , in theory , display as that for you . 
  ah , the reason this is n't working properly is simply that it 's a little inconsistent . 
  css is a painful tool to work with , so the homebrewery 's creator has his work cut out for him . 
  as this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , i am removing it . 
  consider posting this question in the arcana forge megathread instead . 
  but as for myself , yes , i do read the flavour . 
  most importantly , if i am not at least a little bit interested in the flavour , i wo n't ever bother reading the mechanics of it . 
  even maths has its axioms : its assumptions which are * required * to be assumed in order for the rest of maths to work . 
  does it irk anyone else that this copypasta is ` signed ' linus torvalds , when in the text of it , it 's quite clearly * not * being written from linus 's point of view . 
   ** one guy ** , linus torvalds , used gcc to make his operating system ... ** he ** named it ` linux ' ... why does n't he call it gnu/linux ? 
  because he wrote it , with more help from ** his ** friends , not you . 
  you named your stuff , i named my stuff -- including the software i wrote using gcc -- and linus named his stuff . 
  the proper name is linux because linus torvalds says so . 
  linus has spoken . 
  accept his authority . 
  even if you accept that maybe he 's a weirdo who talks about himself in the third person , the bit about how the narrator of this copypasta `` named my stuff '' , as a separate claim from linus naming his stuff , is kinda hard to get past . 
  brilliant copypasta other than that , though . 
  linux is * already * a mainstream operating system . 
  android alone overtook windows as most used operating system browsing the web last week , not to mention all the servers running it , plus the small number of desktop users . 
  linux will never be a mainstream * desktop * operating system would be a valid claim , however . 
  haha yeah same . 
  i went there to vote on a different category , and saw this as well . 
  i had no idea there was a podcast !, 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge , but all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hi , this post is being removed for being in violation of post requirement 1 . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  yeah , but germany is fucking retarded when it comes to technology . 
  yeah , it does . 
  so ... why is a comment saying nothing more than those words relevant ? 
  it 's only 10:15 pm est. 
  even earlier in central or western time . 
  wait , dst is * still * on ? 
  what the fuck , southern states summer ended 41 days ago !, 
  sounds like you handled it fine to me . 
  i just ca n't understand why someone would overthrow the burger master . 
  what will people eat then !, 
  from actually reading their own article , it feels largely made up to me . 
  they basically said `` we do n't really know , but there 's like , uhh , speculation she may have been fired from on-air roles '' . 
  the only direct quote they 've got from either the abc or exelby is the abc saying this :, 
   natasha exelby is a casual contributor , not a staff member . 
  she has been booked for occasional on-air shifts when needed , and also does other occasional shifts for the abc news channel . 
   contributors work out their shifts with managers on a per needs basis . 
  details of individuals ' shifts are confidential to them and not something the abc publicly comments on . 
  i have n't seen any computer game that makes magic feel anywhere near as satisfying as a good old fashioned rpg can . 
  socially-oriented spells , especially , are awkward at best in a pre-programmed environment , and only a real human gm can make them feel right . 
  my recommendation is d&d 5e , but really anything from the crazy overly-mechanical nitpicky 3 . x , to the incredibly free-flowing mechanics-light fate will be leaps and bounds better than the very * best * computer game . 
  in essence means `` this is essentially true , but may not be entirely accurate '' , whereas that is means `` this is another way of restating exactly what i said before '' . 
  so , * so * many people do . 
  and it is infuriating . 
  you 'll first need a podcatcher . 
  if you 're on ios , a really basic podcatcher is made by apple : just search for the `` podcasts '' app on the app store . 
  if you 're on android , you 'll have to find an option from someone else ( some guides i found online suggest google play music has podcasting functionality built in , but i tried it myself and it did n't have it ) , [ stitcher ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stitcher.app&amp;hl=en ) is supposed to be a good app for beginners . 
  stitcher also seems to have an ios app , if you 'd prefer that . 
  i personally use pocket casts , which i would * highly * recommend , but it does have small one-time cost associated with it , so it 's probably not the best choice for someone unsure if they 'll like podcasts . 
  from there , whichever app you go with , it should have a search option . 
  search for the podcast you want , hit subscribe , and start downloading episodes to listen . 
   the best battered fish, 
  well there 's your problem . 
  battered fish ? 
  unaustralian , mate !, 
  i 'm guessing they 're not calling them lightsabers for trademark reasons , but it annoys me that they 're calling them `` dueling sabres '' . 
  made me think it was a hema ( historical weapon ) or sport fencing sabre . 
  i feel lead on . 
  they should 've called them laser swords or something like that , to make it entirely clear that it 's a science-fantasy-inspired weapon , rather than historical . 
   since i hold the liberal position that free markets are inherently good but some regulation is needed to deal with externalities, 
  the problem is that libertarians ** vehemently ** disagree with you on this . 
  they refuse to accept the fact that the free market * does n't * deal appropriately with externalities . 
  they 're further right than the republican party in america is . 
  they 're probably also further `` bottom '' ( assuming you 're referring to the political compass method of describing political positions ) than most liberals are , refusing to accept , for example , the evidence that gun control actually works . 
  they * ca n't * go mainstream , because their positions are so extreme on both fronts that no one but the most extreme libertarians can find much ground to even begin a conversation . 
  and because they 're a purely ideological ( rather than evidence-based ) political position , compromise and coalition building is not an option . 
   the two generally accepted axis of government are libertarian/authoritarian and liberal ( left ) / conservative ( right ) . 
  libertarian means you tend to be against government coercion of its citizens , authoritarian means you tend to support government coercion of its citizens . 
  yes , but when people talk about `` libertarians '' , they are nearly universally referring to what the political compass would call a right-libertarian . 
  typically a ** very ** far right libertarian . 
   axis paradigms of ideology are trash,
