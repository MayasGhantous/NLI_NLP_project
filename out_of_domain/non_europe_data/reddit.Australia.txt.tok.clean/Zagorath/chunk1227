  unlike many other countries , we do n't have an existing nuclear base that just needs to be expanded ; instead , we 'd have to build * everything * up from scratch . 
  it turns out that it 's more economical for us now to invest heavily in renewables . 
  huh ? 
  [ here 's the report ] ( http://www.co2crc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lcoe_executive_summary.pdf ) . 
  i thought it was pretty obvious that `` work '' had to be the correct word , since it was clearly about works in the context of intellectual property , on account of the title * starting * with `` copyright infringement '' ... 
  they lump us in to oceania because that 's where we * are * . 
  it 's not a weird or controversial decision . 
  australia-as-continent has n't been the norm for a long time . 
  would n't that definition result in a large bias towards diagnoses of people who think visually rather than people who subvocalise ? 
  looking only at warlocks , this has some interesting features that jump out at me . 
  * at level 1 , currently , a warlock can cast 1 spell per short rest , or 3 per standard adventuring day . 
  yours can cast 2 per day . 
  * in between levels 2 and 10 , they can cast 2 per short rest , or 6 per day . 
  your warlocks get 4 per day for levels 2-3 and 5 per day for 4-10 . 
  * between 10 and 16 , not counting mystic arcanum , they get 9 per day , whereas yours get only 6 . 
  * and for the last few levels , they get 12 per day and yours get 7 . 
  however , that is all assuming the `` standard adventuring day '' of two short rests per day . 
  and , of course , many people have commented over time that the sad is terribly unrepresentative of how the game plays out in reality under any circumstances other than the most lame old-fashioned dungeon crawl . 
  and so in reality , the warlock ends up getting very few spells . 
  under this system , they end up doing slightly better than in the phb in reality . 
  * at level 1 , a warlock will probably get 1 or 2 per day . 
  * from 2-10 , they 'll probably get 2 or 4 per day . 
  yours get 4 , up to 5 at level four . 
  * between 10 and 16 , they get 3 or 6 , and yours get 6 . 
  * form 17 + they get 4 or 8 and yours get 7 . 
  but it 's not all an improvement . 
  warlocks will be hit ** way ** harder than other classes by the `` falling to zero energy '' rules . 
  considering they * already * feel less capable magically than other classes , this is a big problem . 
  warlocks will also be much less able to use magic items and be more hurt by the `` new enemy types '' . 
  to get away from warlocks a little , i would say there 's a substantial problem with this line :, 
   players are now able to simply roleplay being tired , instead of resorting to the far too frequent , metagaming-type responses referring to spell slots, 
  simply put , no . 
  you 're wrong . 
  this simply changes their potential metagaming from spell slots to energy points . 
  that 's no better . 
  players who would roleplay out being tired still will , but players who would not have no reason to start because of this system . 
   as even a non-magical fighter risks mindbreaking if they weilds [ sic ] their magic sword wihtout [ sic ] care . 
  if a magic weapon costs energy simply to wield , you 've ended up nerfing fighters and barbarians * substantially * . 
  if it costs even * one * point per attack , a 5th level fighter will last a measly * two turns * before he 's out of energy . 
  even if you say one point per * turn * , he 'll last just four turns . 
  fighters absolutely do * not * need a nerf . 
  they fall behind wizards et al. 
  enough already . 
  it also ends up turning the eldritch knight and arcane trickster even * more * useless than they used to be . 
   in addition , cantrips or cantrip like effects ( free to cast , but obviously magical effects , such as channel divinity options , a warlocks mystic arcanum , or swapping the targets of a hunters mark spell ) will cost no energy . 
  huh ? 
  '' * cantrip like effects ... such as channel divinity ... a warlocks * [ sic ] * mystic arcanum * '' ? 
  these are not cantrip-like at all . 
  the defining feature of a cantrip is that you can cast it as many times as you want . 
  mystic arcanum is once per spell level per day . 
  channel divinity has a limitation per short rest . 
  they are nothing like cantrips . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` compendium '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  some people 's `` thoughts '' come in the form of words . 
  in their mind , it 's almost as though they are talking to themselves . 
  this is referred to as `` subvocalisation '' . 
  other people `` think '' in terms of images and shapes . 
  when they 're thinking about something , their mind 's eye actually sees that thing , rather than thinking about the word which names the thing . 
  ( amusingly , both of these categories usually have * no idea * that the other exists . 
  they believe that the way they think is the only way anyone possibly could , and it 's only in conversations like this one where they have any reason to learn otherwise . ), 
  i 'm wondering how your definition of syn\u00e6sthesia would account for this latter case . 
  if someone has an association between a chord and a colour , a subvocaliser would * obviously * not have syn\u00e6sthesia , but someone whose thoughts are visual would be much , * much * harder to distinguish , if indeed it 's possible at all . 
  the bard has a really strong theme that has rather niche appeal . 
  like the warlock , it calls strongly to some people . 
  but to most other people , the idea of [ a guy who sings and also casts spells | making a pact with a devil which is the source of their magic ] is much less appealing . 
  i ca n't say for certain what offended people , but my first guess would be that it 's your choice of wording . 
  you said `` not one * obvious * way '' . 
  that 's not really true . 
  there 's one obvious option for evaluating the winner in a ranked choice situation , as well as a couple of other feasible ones . 
  what there * is n't * is a * perfect * method . 
  using the instant-runoff system is the * obvious * choice because it 's by far the most widely used system around the world , including but not limited to australia 's house of representatives ; the us state of maine 's senate , house , and state legislature ; and irish presidential elections . 
  and that 's without getting in to countries which use single transferable vote , of which irv is essentially a special case . 
  it 's not a perfect option , because it does n't guarantee a condorcet winner , and it can in some cases have a `` dictator '' ( at least if i 'm understanding arrow 's impossibility theorem 's description of a dictator correctly ) . 
  but just because it is n't theoretically perfect , does n't mean it is n't the * obvious * choice . 
   and they say print media is dead . 
  no , but its audience very nearly is . 
   i 'm rather confused as to where you 're getting the numbers from with regard to the warlock spells per day . 
  warlocks in the phb get a certain number of spells per * short rest * , not long rest , like other classes . 
  the game is balanced around what wotc calls the `` standard adventuring day '' , which includes 2 short rests each day . 
  so that 's where i got the phb warlock spells per day . 
  for yours , i was assuming they get all of their points back on a long rest , just like the other classes , since you did not specify otherwise . 
  based on that , i was assuming the number that you gave , plus two ( i used +1 for my calculations under level 4 ) , to account for getting one point back on a short rest , and two short rests per day . 
  basically , if you said they get 3 energy points , i assumed they would have a total of 5 per day . 
  three to start with , plus one after the first short rest , plus one more after the second short rest . 
  in my second section , where i was describing what * actually * happens most often , i assumed either zero or one short rest per day , and used that as my calculation for both your warlock and the phb one . 
   i 've been debating making warlock spell energy costs percentile , and simply giving them as many points as standard casters , would you say this fixes the issue ? 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know what you mean by this , so i do n't know if it would work . 
  that 's true , but not really relevant . 
  the speed force has n't been touched on in yj because it does n't * exist * in the young justice universe . 
   this means that , since a warlock normally regains all of his or her spell slots during a short rest , he or she would with this system also regain all of his or her spell points during a short rest, 
  i would suggest you should probably be specific in stating that , because it is absolutely ** not ** clear currently . 
  but regardless , doing that would make warlocks *** waaay *** too powerful . 
  that would result in a 5th level warlock being able to cast * fireball * ** nine ** times in one standard adventuring day . 
  crazy . 
  an interesting idea . 
  but unfortunately i do n't think it would really help a lot . 
  their comparatively limited number of spells means they 'll be more tempted to use them all up . 
  you 'd also have the problem that if , for example , their spells take up 33 % and they have 12 points , normally they can cast three spells , costing them 4 each . 
  but if they were to lose just * one * point , and go down to 11 , they can now only cast two spells . 
  they 'll have 3 points remaining that they just ca n't use at all .
