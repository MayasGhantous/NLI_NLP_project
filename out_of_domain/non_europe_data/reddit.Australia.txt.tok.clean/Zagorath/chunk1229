  best of luck . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  that sort of technique is virtually impossible without the right brushes . 
  luckily , if you look in the subreddit resources ( see the sidebar ) we 've collated the various brushes and other resources you would need to make images that look good using photoshop . 
  export them out as png files , upload them somewhere that is able to host pngs with their alpha channel intact ( imgur is good , but only if the total size of your file is under about 5 mb ) . 
  then link them into the homebrewery . 
  this is really well made , and very useful . 
  i had never thought of the ` < br  ` option repeatedly for large breaks between paragraphs . 
  usually , i would use multiple paragraphs containing only ` & nbsp ; ` for that . 
  both techniques are useful and have a different effect . 
  yours results in the next paragraph appearing as the first in a section : no indentation . 
  mine treats it as the second or subsequent paragraph of a section , and indents it slightly accordingly . 
  of course , the same effect as yours can be achieved using the included `` vertical spacing '' option ( under editor -  vertical spacing ) . 
  changing the value of ` margin-top ` to match your needs . 
  it 's also worth noting that in markdown , which is the primary markup language homebrewery uses , a line ending in two spaces inserts a ` < br  ` element . 
  so for your second page example , it would work a lot more elegantly if instead of writing it out as a big paragraph with ` < br  ` written all over it , you instead wrote it up using that method . 
  view the source for [ this example ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/hjjgzn6pe ) , and notice how it displays exactly the same as yours , but the code is a little more easy to work with . 
  the underlines thing is another thing i had absolutely never thought of . 
  and oh my fucking gods , i had ** no idea ** html was able to do blending modes !, 
  that is so incredibly useful !, 
  in 90 % of cases it 's probably not the best choice : editing in photoshop with the right brushes is likely to achieve a better result . 
  but holy fuck in that 10 % of cases this is bloody ** perfect ** . 
  one other thing worth keeping in mind is that one of the absolute * best * features of homebrewery is that it allows you to use pretty much any html or css option you want . 
  that means if you ca n't figure out a simple way to get it to do what you desire using the tools in the site 's menu , you can almost certainly fiddle with things on there until you can find an option that shows things how you intended . 
  it makes it an incredibly powerful and flexible tool that we are ** so ** lucky to have . 
  / u/stolksdorf really can not be commended * enough * for his work on this . 
  i notice you put spaces in there to make it display properly on reddit . 
  just a tip , you can put text like this in between backticks ( & nbsp ;\\ ` text here \\ ` & nbsp  , and it will display as a `` code '' block , which causes it to be displayed literally . 
  i loved the psion in 4e . 
  really strong flavour and it made a lot of sense , while being well balanced . 
  the 5e mystic playtest is just awful . 
  it 's magic now , but not spells . 
  it 's psionic , but also you can do elemental shit , teleporting , and other clearly not psionic stuff . 
  it 's capable of being the best or nearly the best at nearly any area of the game , be it mobility , damage , social interactions , healing , or resisting damage , and switch between which one it 's good at with a simple bonus action . 
  it 's just so terribly made compared to the 4e one . 
  i ** want ** to love it . 
  but ... i just ca n't ... 
  i hate bards in 5e * so much * . 
  the whole bards-as-spellcasters is just so dumb . 
  if their spells could all be flavoured as magically laced speech/singing , it 'd be fine . 
  give them * sleep * , * suggestion * , * vicious mockery * , and maybe even * healing word * , since hp is an abstraction which includes confidence and will to continue . 
  but for the gods ' sake do n't give them * thunderwave * , * dancing lights * , * invisibility * , or * dispel magic * . 
  and magical secrets is the dumbest feature for a hard you could * possibly * come up with . 
  i just hate 5e 's bard so much . 
  no , what he 's saying is very much the current canon . 
  it 's mostly from the last two books by erin m. evans ( * ashes of the tyrant * and * the devil you know * , the fifth and sixth novels in the brimstone angels series , respectfully ) , which are largely set in the vayemniri city of djerad thymar ( forgive my spelling , i 'm on phone so ca n't easily double check it , and i listened to the books rather than reading , so have not seen it written ) . 
  these books are set in 1486 and 1487 dr , and they coincide with the events of out of the abyss and storm king 's thunder . 
  dragonborn of the forgotten realms came to toril ( the main world in which play happens ) from the twin world of abeir during the spellplague . 
  the people of toril started calling them dragonborn because they physically resemble dragons . 
  but the vayemniri do n't like being called by that name , because back in abeir they were enslaved by dragons , and as a result they understandably have a hatred of them . 
  incidentally , they also have a hatred of * any * relationship which resembles that of subordination , which is why dragonborn clerics are incredibly rare . 
  they begrudgingly mostly accept others calling them dragonborn , because everyone does , and explaining all of this to every person they meet becomes tedious , and even when they do not everyone cares enough to change . 
   additionally , vayemniri can have colors even dragons do n't and their resistance/breath weapon type is n't actually tied to their color . 
  a yellow vayemniri might have cold breath and cold resistance . 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  i somehow got the impression that vayemniri skin was all kind of muddied and blurred together , rather than having the distinct colour ranges dragons can have . 
  but it seems you are indeed correct . 
   the scales a dragonborn wore were scarlet , gold , rust , ocher , bronze , or brown in hue , though they in fact bore little correlation to a dragonborn 's breath weapon and the scale colors of true dragons . 
  as a side note , great to meet another evans fan in here . 
  this is the first i 'm seeing of it . 
  i mostly try to avoid future news about shows , so i only see it if it floats to the top of this sub at a time when i 'm on reddit . 
  i made a pact with a devil and now i have to walk the line between living up to my side of the bargain and staying true to my humanity , or i 'll lose my soul ( both literally and figuratively ) . 
  nope . 
  4e 's bards were perfect . 
  you could n't imagine the pied piper or a satyr casting that , so no , it does n't make sense . 
  it 's a little more borderline than some of the other ridiculous spells the bard gets given , but it 's still not one that makes sense . 
  i do n't care what they have `` always '' been ( and by the way , they * have n't * always had the sorts of ridiculous flavour 5e gives them , anyway -- the powers 4e gave bards make perfect sense with the context of what a bard is ) , i care about what makes internal sense and what fits the archetype . 
  the archetypical bard is the pied piper , and their magic is all about charms and stuff like that . 
  the bard as a generic spell caster just does n't make sense . 
  wizards get magic through intense study , and thus they use intelligence . 
  sorcerers get magic as an innate part of themselves , and thus use charisma . 
  bards , what ? 
  their magic , supposedly , comes from their force of personality , and it does n't make sense that they 'd be able to use that to cast * fireball * or * dispel magic * or whatever . 
  i know people on this forum love the bard , but i just can not possibly understand why . 
  and instead of trying to actually explain the reason , people downvote me or give bullshit excuses like `` that 's how it always was '' . 
  what i love most about this is that when you point out how stupid the bard 's flavour is , none of its fans can really even attempt to provide a logical explanation . 
  oh , well if that 's it then it 's just dumb . 
  did n't enlil die at the end of the devil you know ? 
  or at least lose his godhood or something ? 
   do any of you still eat there ? 
  yeah for sure . 
  it 's by far my favourite fast food place . 
  i prefer their roast chicken over kfc 's fried , and i 'm not really a fan of burgers ( especially of the fast food variety ) so maccas and hungry jack 's are out . 
  plus , their chips are to * die * for . 
  whenever i 'm in the city i usually pop down to the red rooster in the myer centre just to grab some chips because they 're so fucking good . 
  so yeah , i love it and i 'm glad they 're still in business . 
  but i have to agree with you , i have no idea * how * they 're in business . 
  the myer centre one especially always seems so much more empty than everyone around it , so i wonder how it 's able to afford the rent in what has to be a crazy expensive place . 
  the conspiracy theory going around that they 're a front for money laundering or something seems like it might not be the * most * crazy of ideas anyone has ever had . 
  ah right , i see . 
  yeah , a globally established ranking is definitely a useful thing to be able to have . 
  and irv * does * spit that out : just take the reverse of the order in which candidates were eliminated . 
  but yeah , it 's not the best system to use if a ranked list is what you want . 
  it 's better than fptp of course ( what is n't ) , but yeah , not great . 
  i 'd be more likely to roll my eyes and say something like karshoji tiamesh under my breath . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  indecision , as they say , is a decision of its own .
