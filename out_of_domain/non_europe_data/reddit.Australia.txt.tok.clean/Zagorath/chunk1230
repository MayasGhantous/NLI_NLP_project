  when a superior option is presented and explained , and their reaction is `` meh '' , that 's the same result as if they said `` not a chance in hell '' . 
  the improvement does n't get incorporated . 
  but in my last comment when i said their reasoning was `` we do n't want to use a better one because we like the worse one '' , i was specifically referring to this comment :, 
   i do n't care for perfect proportionality at all times . 
  i 'm looking at it at a level based timeframe , not lifetime . 
  which is essentially the same sort of argument you see people use sometimes in favour of fptp as a voting system for political elections , rather than moving to the * objectively superior * systems like irv , stv , or mmp . 
  is this a technical question about how to do something in sibelius , or an artistic question about how to score for violin ? 
  it sounds to me like the latter . 
  i 'd recommend watching [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/xc5p6ad2wue ) on scoring for unaccompanied violin . 
  the same channel has similar videos for a bunch of other string combinations , including violin and piano , if that interests you . 
  when you say `` part chicken meals '' , is that like what you get if you order the `` classic quarter '' or a `` half chicken and chips '' ? 
  if so , that 's literally all i ever order from them . 
  you can also look outside the phb to see that the realms are clearly the default setting . 
  every published adventure except curse of strahd is in the realms , with only some brief notes in some of them for how to run it in other worlds . 
  additionally , the rules supplements ( sword coast adventurer 's guide and volo 's guide to monsters ) are both forgotten realms specific content . 
   based on other literature related to the subject , it seems to be agreed upon by all parties, 
  right , then please share the relevant literature . 
  apa style preferred . 
  they serve fish and chips ? 
  just ... why ? 
  i misread this as, 
   you 're that parent who makes your eat glue , are n't you ? 
  and was * very * weirded out . 
  how is that ipad connected to the internet ? 
  because if it 's on the same wifi connection as your own computer , as far as your isp is concerned it 's the same connection . 
  thus depends on the seedbox and how it 's set up . 
  i 'm using my parents ' media pc as my overseas seedbox , but i had no luck getting it to work as a vpn , and not for lack of trying . 
  this is true for most sites these days , but not all . 
  especially on smaller and less reputable companies ' websites , ssl/tls still is n't as ubiquitous as we 'd like it to be . 
  a vpn would also make it so that any traffic that might otherwise be unmetred will be counted . 
  for example , when i was living on campus at university , all government websites ( including abc iview ) and all google websites ( including youtube ) did n't count towards the 5 gb/month ( when i was first there ) or 20 gb/month ( towards the end ) limit . 
  at that point , a vpn would substantially increase the amount of data used . 
  ** sly . 
  ** this means either something has to be going wrong in the gif , ** or the subject of the gif appears to be doing one thing but instead does another **, 
  emphasis mine, 
  no , i understood the joke . 
  i was simply pointing out that the joke may not actually * work * . 
   i thought being the day of theological resurrection, 
  is n't easter sunday the day of jesus 's resurrection , in christian mythology ? 
  was n't when this was posted . 
   and it was n't because of territorial ambitions or resources , it was idealogical, 
  it was actually * kinda * based on territorial reasons , but in the opposite direction . 
  they were afraid that a unified democratic korea would give the west too much power in the region , and might even cause them to threaten pushing further north into china . 
  at least that 's how i was taught it when living in korea . 
  the difference is specifically that china tries to use these bases as a justification for [ claiming the entire south china sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_china_sea#/media/file:south_china_sea_claims_map.jpg ) , an area it quite clearly has * no * legal basis to claim , including resource rights . 
   enthusiasm in the region for lining up against china behind the us is pretty non-existent other than in one or two rather dumb allies, 
  make no mistake , the entire region * hates * china . 
  both for its historical attempts at dominating the region , and for its current bogus claims to the south china sea . 
  if they do n't openly act against china , it is primarily out of * fear * of retribution , not any actual agreement or alliance with the chinese . 
   china wo n't start it they will be defending territory they see as theirs, 
  what they `` see as theirs '' is irrelevant . 
  they claim territory which under international law -- and according to simple basic logic -- clearly is * not * theirs . 
  if they strike out in an attempt to defend that territory , they * are * the aggressors . 
  switzerland profiteered off of that war . 
  they were quite happy to sell the nazis supplies which aided their war effort , and buy their gold to provide the nazis with more funds . 
  make no mistake , switzerland 's infamous `` neutrality '' was absolutely not a moral good , and it 's not something we should be aiming to replicate . 
  no , not my government . 
  my government is number one best government . 
  i could never possibly say any bad thing about them . 
  they are perfect and know what is best . 
   double space after each line , then hit enter, 
  no , hit enter twice . 
  double space followed by enter does n't start a new paragraph , it only inserts a line break , which is ugly and semantically incorrect on most subreddits , but on * this * one it has the double effect of also resulting in an incorrect display of the greentext format . 
  inserting line breaks displays as follows :, 
   text, 
   more text, 
   yet more, 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  your spell slots are * way * out . 
  you 've got completely dead levels at 11 , 13 , and 19 . 
  you 're giving an asi at 18 that should instead be at 19 . 
  you state that spells known is in the class table , but there is no such column . 
  you also have the entire spellcasting section twice , with slightly different information in each . 
  that 's all found from an extremely quick cursory glance aiming to find common and glaring errors . 
  these are also all pretty easily fixed . 
  but it says nothing about the quality or lack thereof of the rest of the class . 
  they 're all shit . 
  i do n't know how they compare to other countries ' soaps because i 've never seen them , but i assume they 're probably pretty much the same level of shit . 
  i do n't have a device with terminal access handy , but would n't ` ifconfig | grep - i `` gateway '' ` be simpler and achieve the same thing ? 
  still less bizarre/dramatic than the guy who ate a flameskull after he killed it . 
  if it were visible in the sky from brisbane , that would be by far their best * success * ever . 
  it took me until my third reading of that title to parse it as the day of a new cycling jersey , rather than new jersey day , a day honouring the us state . 
  you 're correct , but from context it 's clear they did n't really mean strand , they meant `` clump '' or something like that . 
  consider also cross posting to / r/imaginaryclerics !, 
  this is great . 
  you need to hit enter twice to get paragraphs to display properly on separate lines . 
  i wonder , are you familiar with the `` scout '' roguish ( that 's how you spell it , by the way ) archetype [ from wizards ' unearthed arcana articles ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2017_01_ua_rangerrogue_0117jcmm.pdf ) ? 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` adventure '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as a side note , you 've called this `` guide to '' riddles , but i 'm currently not seeing any real guide to how one can go about creating riddles . 
  this would be an * invaluable * resource if you could provide it . 
  is a chapter 3 on the way ? 
  i have n't read through them properly yet , but the rhymes were all really good . 
  quite a few that were n't `` perfect '' rhymes , but you clearly know how to form a good rhyming structure -- some types of near rhymes work better for a riddle than others , and you 've used the right types . 
   natural 1s and 20s are only special on attack rolls, 
  and on death saving throws . 
  possibly all saving throws too , i forget . 
  but yeah , they * definitely * do n't do anything special for ability checks . 
   one of the most spectacular failures of the romantics , imo, 
  what , like , all of them ? 
  i think a lot of great music out there has at least a broad programme , if not one as detailed as the fantastique .
