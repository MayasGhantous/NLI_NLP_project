  things like the movement titles in beethoven 's symphony no . 
  6 , or the general knowledge that tchaikovsky 's 1812 was about that war . 
  pieces like mussorgsky 's pictures at an exhibition and rimsky-korsakov 's scheherazade are also * greatly * enhanced by their programmes . 
  not to mention that there is a great deal of romantic era music out there * without * a programme at all . 
  personally , i 've always liked symphonie fantasique knowing just the movement titles , without a more detailed programme . 
  i really should give this a listen some time . 
  i only know it as the answer to the joke `` what 's the longest viola joke ? '', 
  yup . 
  oh , if you do make a guide , i would recommend adding a section not just on how to * make * a riddle , but discussing the various ways in which a riddle can be * used * . 
  for example , that prevailing wisdom suggests not making them a complete roadblock to progressing with the main story/quest . 
  ( and various different ways to get around this , while still including riddles : for example , using the riddle only to gain extra optional rewards , or offering the riddle as an easy way through the quest , but with another option if the answer ca n't be found . ), 
  a quick scan of the monster manual suggests that the most common one is deep speech , but even that 's probably at best about half of all aberrations . 
  just so you know , username mentions only work if you mention at most three people . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  reddit search is better now than it used to be , but still not great . 
  it has one ** huge ** advantage over reddit , especially for this subreddit , which is that you can search by flair , but other than that it 's still not great . 
  speaking as an individual , i think this is a great idea . 
  it would be awesome to have a single place one can go to see all of the most up-to-date versions of everything submitted here , sorted in a slightly more useful way than our current flair system . 
  but speaking as a moderator , we just do n't see this as at all feasible . 
  we get dozens of submissions each day , and that 's only increasing as we grow . 
  sorting each of those into there right category , including enough useful information in this almanac to make it a useful or worthwhile source , making sure that updated versions are * updated * , rather than including the newer copy as a second entry , etc. 
  it 's a ** lot ** of work , and would probably require * at least * one person working full time on that task , but probably three to five . 
  and that 's before you even start getting into the issue of archiving the subreddit 's entire existing history . 
  that would be an enormous undertaking and would require a lot of people working on it . 
  there 's also the question of exactly how this would be sorted . 
  sure , a section with all the fighter subclasses , another with all the warlock ones , etc. 
  is a good idea . 
  but your example of the 10 different samurais raises another issue : what if there are multiple attempts at the same concept , which go about it in a different way ? 
  maybe there are some fighter archetypes , some barbarian paths , and some full classes , all of which describe a samurai . 
  in the sorting system suggested above , these would be split up . 
  so a good almanac would probably need to have an entirely separate section where different takes on the same idea get grouped together , * in addition * to the aforementioned section . 
  and that compounds the work even further . 
  so while i think it is a fantastic idea , and i wish we could do it , we as moderators just do not see this as feasible . 
  what problem do you have with sneak attack , aside from perhaps that its name is absolutely terrible at representing what it does ? 
  which is great , until someone comes along with a * counterspell * or dispel magic and makes your nonmagical abilities stop working . 
  it also has the problem that `` i do one ability once , and another twice , and now for some reason i ca n't do any of my abilities again today ? '', 
  in 5e , nonmagical abilities that do n't have a particular flavour reason that they would `` take it out of you '' ( e.g. 
  rage , second wind ) are generally unlimited use . 
  a ranger is someone you expect to be able to keep going all day . 
  advantage , or just an ally near the target . 
  or , if you 're a swashbuckler , be in a one-on-one situation . 
  it 's * all * about the flavour . 
  most rogues can only get the damage bonus when they 're able to land a particularly precise blow , such as when the opponent is distracted by another foe , or when they 're otherwise at a significant advantage . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !,

  on reddit , you need to hit enter twice for it to create a new paragraph . 
  personally , i do n't have an opinion on him as a dm . 
  he 's probably great , but i do n't enjoy watching other people 's games at all , so it 's hard for me to comment . 
  as a dm advice guy , i find that he has good ( not necessarily * great * , but at least good ) content , but terrible presentation . 
  the dramatic voices and stuff he does probably enhance his players ' and viewers ' experience on critical role , but they 're immensely distracting in his informational videos, 
  [ age of empires ii ] ( http://www.gamemusicthemes.com/sheetmusic/personalcomputer/ageofempiresii/index.html ) is my favourite video game piece that i play regularly . 
  really , really simple , and instantly recognisable to most people . 
  it 's a lesser-known one , but i also really enjoy a variety of the themes from [ dark cloud ] ( http://ichigos.com/sheets/183 ) , particularly matataki village and music box . 
  hey , sorry , but reddit does n't allow link shorteners like tinyurl . 
  people ca n't know what they 're linking to before they click , so they 're potentially dangerous . 
  could you please edit this comment to include a direct link to whatever it 's meant to be , and then let me know that it has been edited so that i can approve it and make it visible to others ? 
  cheers . 
   my players only speak english and bad english . 
  your players speak danish ? 
  hahaha . 
  he 's not wrong , but using the `` report '' button for that is amusing . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinglabs.nfcalarm ) or [ this ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wroclawstudio.puzzlealarmclock&amp;hl=en ) might help . 
  i have n't gotten around to trying them out myself yet , but if you put a qr code or nfc tag in the bathroom , and have an alarm that makes you scan/tap that before it 'll turn off , that should in theory help a lot . 
  for me there are two key differences . 
  the first is that dogs are carnivores . 
  the animals we usually eat are herbivorous . 
  this is better for health as it means lower levels of toxic chemicals . 
  biomagnification means dogs and other carnivores are simply less safe to eat . 
  the other is , at least relative to the korean way of eating dogs , a matter of ethics . 
  i 'm not under any delusions that cows and chickens are being treated especially nicely , but the standard way of killing dogs in korea is absolutely abhorrent . 
  they tie them up and whip them to death , in order to get the adrenaline going , which supposedly improves the taste . 
  if i was gon na roll a wizard , i might swap wither cha or wis for dex or con . 
  get the ac or health bonus for a little survivability . 
  play as either an incredibly book smart but street dumb stereotypical nerd ( low wis ) or an autistic savant ( low cha ) .

  is `` neptune 's beard '' supposed to be a swear ? 
  i always assumed it was just a minor explanation , like saying `` god damn it '' . 
  your first two and penultimate paragraphs pretty much perfectly summarise why i did n't like him at the time , and still do n't now . 
  i do n't know what it is , but his cockiness is not at all endearing like it is with some other characters . 
  i think maybe it 's because he seems to feel genuinely much better than he 's treated ( when he actually * is n't * ) , whereas with other characters it feels more like they 're playing tough or trying to big themselves up for their own sake . 
  i dunno , it 's hard to explain . 
  the ads that are worth blocking will be blocked by this . 
  standard banner ads are a relatively insignificant size in comparison to most modern websites . 
  it 's when they 're got big fancy animations or autoplay videos that the bandwidth savings become significant , and this would block that . 
  annoyingly , ublock does n't have an option to allow through unobtrusive ads , because its devs are that shitty `` all ads are bad and must be blocked '' types . 
   on a ten point scale , a 7 is like a c. 
  huh ? 
  a c is barely a pass . 
  7/10 is a solid b under the systems i 've usually worked with . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i have n't used lettered grades since years 10 -- 11 in high school . 
  my last two years of school , plus all of university , have used a grading system of 1 -- 7 , where 4 is a pass . 
  but back when i had a lettered system , it was a * 85 % , a 75 % , b 65 % , c ( the lowest grade considered a pass ) 55 % .
