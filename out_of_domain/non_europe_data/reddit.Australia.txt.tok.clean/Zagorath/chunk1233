  dvorak being nearly completely different makes the code switching ( to borrow a term from linguistics ) easier . 
   buy a keyboard with native support, 
  no , absolutely ** do n't ** do that . 
  one of the best advantages of learning dvorak is the fact that you 're forcing yourself to learn completely through touch typing -- looking at the keyboard is n't an option . 
  we have nesquik here in australia too . 
  or at least , we did when i was a kid -- i do n't think i 've seen it recently . 
  it 's really very , * very * different . 
  you do n't mix it through as thoroughly usually ( personally , i actually do n't mix it at all ) . 
  milo is less sweet , and has a certain crunch to it , even when mixed in . 
  nesquik is closer to just making chocolate milk . 
  it 's also nice to eat on its own , whereas unmixed nesquik is horrible . 
   phone numbers do n't begin with 0, 
  you what mate ? 
  everywhere i 've lived they literally * always * begin with 0 . 
  unless you include the country code , i guess , but seeing as it 's 10 digits , that does n't seem to be the case . 
   it 's certainly in the dc animated universe , given how damien interacts with deathstroke, 
  huh ? 
  i do n't remember the dcau having damien * at all * . 
  come to think of it , i do n't remember deathstroke being in it either . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing written stories from roleplaying games , and so it is being removed . 
  comics would be more appropriate at / r/dndmemes or / r/dnd . 
  when i 'm unable to read physical books , i find audiobooks are a great way to get a good story in with a lot less effort . 
  audible 's a great service that you can use to find pretty much any book you could possibly desire . 
  pm me for a referral code that can get you * two * free books ( most referrals/free signups only get one ) for your first month , if you 're interested . 
  podcasts are also great , and many good ones have been mentioned below . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  downvote , report , and move on -- silently . 
   there is supposed to be one red marker for each train station ( if you have an example where it 's not let me know and we will fix it ) . 
  / u/beastjim included a screenshot with their post . 
  unfortunately it was in the form of a link with no text in it , so it 's unclickable . 
  if you have res ( which , if you 're on reddit more than four minutes in your lifetime , you * should * ) , its inline display is the only way to get at the picture . 
  [ here is an easy , clickable link to jim 's screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/njjxgwn.png ) . 
  it normally would n't , but that came right after a push from trending , so we left it in . 
   what 's your definition of the best keyboard layout ? 
  primarily comfort in typing , especially for long periods . 
  secondarily , typing speed . 
  i have never found the keyboard shortcuts argument compelling in the least . 
  first , because macos has a keyboard layout called `` dvorak & nbsp ; -- & nbsp ; qwerty & nbsp ; \u2318 '' which completely solves the problem , and second , because the shortcuts are honestly not that bad anyway and even when i 'm on windows or linux i 've never found it to be too much of a problem . 
  it 's another one of those theoretical improvements that just does n't pan out in practice . 
  hmm ? 
  could you explain what you mean by that ? 
  stv already , as designed , takes into account the ability to select an arbitrary number of victors . 
  i 'm curious about what specifically is being changed by making top three votes all count as a vote 1 , and why that rather than normal stv ? 
  what happens if the vote that 's * actually * first preference gets eliminated , does it go to the one they put 2 , resulting in one person essentially voting twice for the same person ?

  really ? 
  why ? 
  that seems really strange and unnecessary , when stv is already such an incredibly robust and well-tested method .

  wait what ? 
  but why . 
  why a silent k , and why use an ar for something pronounced ur ? 
  it 's not like the latin alphabet is its original script , * we can transliterate it however we want * , so why choose a way that literally everyone is going to get wrong ? 
  if you 're interested in learning to play the moonlight sonata ( or , honestly , any beethoven sonata ) , i would * highly * recommend checking out andras schiff 's excellent lecture on the piece . 
  he has some great advice on interpretation that is well worth listening to . 
  well , it 's for voice , which automatically makes it inferior to all but the most trite of orchestral compositions . 
  the name for these numbers is `` antiprime '' numbers ( or , more technically , `` highly composite '' numbers , but antiprime is cooler ) . 
  2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , etc. 
  they each have more factors than any number less than them . 
  very interesting that these are indeed numbers used a lot in real life . 
  we talk about `` a dozen '' , and we used to use 12 inches to the foot as a measurement . 
  we use 60 seconds/minutes in a minute/hour , and 24 hours in a day . 
  one of the oldest number systems was base 60 . 
  we use 360 degrees in a circle ( unless we 're woke enough to prefer radians ) . 
  of course , to the modern mathematical understanding , choice of base is relatively unimportant . 
  we have a thorough understanding of rational numbers so fractions and decimals are absolutely no obstacle . 
  far more important is the ability to convert between different units , which is why metric/si is so incredibly superior . 
  but in an age where using non-integer amounts is more difficult for most people , and where converting units is less necessary ( i doubt many medieval people were calculating the power output of an ox based on how much energy it expends over how much time , and getting the energy based on the weight of a thing and how far it was moved ) , older systems work well enough . 
  the best of both worlds would probably be a base-12 consistent system . 
  1728 m ( expressed in base 12 as 1000 m ) to a kilometre , 1728 g to a kilogramme and 1728 kg to a tonne , etc. 
  but we do n't have that unfortunately . 
   i expect the k is not completely silent , but maybe blends into the g somehow, 
  then why write it with the apostrophe / \u02bbokina , which most people are going to interpret as a glottal stop ? 
  do what korean transliterators did with ' \u3131 ' and transliterate it as just ` g ' or ` k ' , depending on the specific transliteration method . 
   similarly , i expect that neither `` ur '' nor `` ar '' are perfect , and they simply went with the one that would get the average person saying something that is as close as possible, 
  but everyone here , including the original article , is saying that `` ur '' is how the average english speaker should try to say it , not `` ar '' . 
  if `` ar '' was the best way of doing it , these pronunciation guides would not be necessary . 
  as someone who reads ( but does not properly speak ) korean , i understand fully the frustration of transliteration . 
  korean transliteration methods are absolutely awful . 
  but they do they best they can with a language that just functions so differently from our own . 
  based on this one specific word , however , it seems like the transliteration is almost actively making things worse . 
  that 's a good point . 
  the bit that i left out , i had misinterpreted as referring to maintaining the etymology of the word in its language , which i did n't see as relevant . 
  now that i see what you really meant , yeah , that 's a pretty decent idea . 
  the counterargument would be : ipa . 
  a transliteration into the latin alphabet should , in my opinion , be about getting a pronunciation that the average speaker of a latin alphabet using language will be as correct as possible in . 
  if that means sacrificing some small differences ( as opposed to exaggerating the differences by a much greater magnitude ) , then that 's the path that i think they should take . 
  to preserve the true pronunciation , ipa should be used instead .
