  or maybe it 's pain ? 
  or heat ? 
  or balance ? 
  definitely one of them . 
  point being , the `` five senses '' are really not much more valid than the tongue taste map . 
  the only difference being that these senses do actually _ exist _ , they 're just not an exhaustive list . 
   the death of a parent, 
  til my 57-year-old father is not an adult . 
  but anyway , as far as i 'm concerned , adulthood starts when you turn 18 . 
  that 's when the law considers you of age , and as far as i 'm concerned any other definition is just no true scotsmanning . 
  sure , the occasional high schooler might be included in that , but that just means some high schoolers are adults . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  yeah , this is definitely appropriate . 
  the title given to the photo brings up a good point , though . 
  while the sign itself is n't gatekeeping , it carries the implication ( and if you were to go to the church , you would probably find the same ) that they claim ** one particular interpretation ** of the * incredibly * self-contradictory and non-specific writings on the teachings of jesus is what 's required to be a `` real christian '' . 
  [ here 's the quiz ] ( https://www.women.com/emily/quiz-if-you-can-get-a-10-slash-15-on-this-quiz-you-must-be-catholic ) if anyone is interested . 
  i 'm not catholic -- i 'm not even christian -- and i was raised in a pretty areligious household , but i still got 100 % . 
  i made two or three educated guesses , and one or two complete guesses , but that 's still a comfortable 10/15 . 
  edit : wait , never mind . 
  the quiz lies to you . 
  it says you got 100 % as long as you got at least 10/15 . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  yeah i agree completely . 
  who needs economists ? 
  our politicians and monetary institutions can just wing it and the economy will be fine . 
  what benefit does society get from understanding the human mind or how humans interact ? 
  clearly psychology and sociology are a complete waste of time . 
  history ? 
  nah , all that stuff from hundreds of years ago could never possibly be relevant again . 
  geography ? 
  who needs to know anything about the locations , demographics , or cultures outside of our own ? 
  that 's a complete waste of time trying to understand it . 
  social `` sciences '' ? 
  ha , more like social `` lie-ences '' , amirite ? 
   and boy did bing want me to use an nsfw pic for this, 
  that 's what you get for using bing . 
  it 's literally good for nothing else . 
  literally any place could do zimmer justice . 
  there 's just not much justice to be had from him . 
  i had my gocard top up * twice * on saturday . 
  in one day . 
  fucking airport train is just stupidly fucking expensive . 
   though i agree a disturbing number of drivers do n't understand them, 
  i wish they would put * half * as much effort into enforcing the roundabout blinker laws as they do enforcing the speed limit . 
  i 've had a mixed experience with that . 
  movie world and dreamworld are leagues better than disney land in hong kong , but they absolutely pale in comparison to lotte world in seoul . 
  or at least they did when i was last at each of them . 
   i guarantee for the other 364 days of the year that the thought of rememberance will have never crossed their mind, 
  let 's be kind here . 
  it 's 363 days . 
  there 's also remembrance day . 
  i 've found that code completion/recommendation in intellij is just awful in general . 
  it 's the one thing i prefer about eclipse , and it 's also perhaps one of the most important features . 
  i 'm most excited for gotham coming back , but that 's got more to do with the length of its absence than the quality of any of the shows . 
  i 'm guessing that means something different where you 're from ? 
  because [ i would absolutely not want to be wearing pastels ] ( https://www.artsupplies.co.uk/img_item/inscribe_pastel.jpg ) . 
  someone 's clearly never seen an australian anti-smoking ad . 
  maybe things are different in switzerland , but [ where i 'm from in australia , as well as in new zealand and the uk , it 's not even close ] ( http://www.executivestyle.com.au/finding-fault-when-cyclists-and-motorists-collide-ghwwze ) . 
  drivers are at fault in the * vast * majority of cases , not cyclists . 
  cyclists are not even at fault in a majority of cyclist-pedestrian collisions , it turns out . 
  it 's 1/2 mv ^ ( 2 ) . 
   `` cyclist at fault '' might be the largest single category of car-bike collision, 
  perhaps in switzerland this is true . 
  i do n't know or have data on it . 
  [ but it 's enormously far from being true in most anglophonic countries ] ( http://www.executivestyle.com.au/finding-fault-when-cyclists-and-motorists-collide-ghwwze ) . 
  the self-contradictory part kinda speaks for itself . 
  it 's extremely well known that the bible contains hundreds of contradictory passages . 
  there was a really good graph that helped visualise the contradictions that floated around a few years ago . 
  i could have perhaps been a bit clearer with what i meant when i said non-specific . 
  what i was referring to was the idea that , even where there are * not * contradictions , which passages of the bible are still relevant today and should be followed by modern christians is not well specified . 
  there are so , * so * many passages of the bible that christians of all denominations just flat out ignore , mostly because it 's inconvenient to follow them . 
  [ here 's a pretty good list ] ( http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf ) . 
  take whichever ones you want . 
  since you 're on a mac rather than ios device , some of these are unnecessary . 
  option - = gives \u2260 , and option-shift - = ( i.e. , option - + ) gives \u00b1 . 
  the option keys are a mixture of intuitive and not-so-intuitive . 
  intuitive ones :, 
  option plus | gives, 
  shift - | --, 
  <  ( but without the shift ) | \u2264 \u2265, 
  s | \u00df, 
  without shift ) | \u00a1, 
  plus all of the dead key options ( and a few not dead key options ) for accents like \u00e9 , \u00fc , \u00ee , \u00e8 , \u00e7 , and \u00f1, 
  less intuitive ones that i personally remember because they 're useful, 
  option plus | gives, 
  and of course k for ( but that one only displays on apple devices ) . 
  this is true according to the 5e rule set , but is * not * true according to the lore of the forgotten realms , which is the default setting for most of the published adventures , including pota . 
  the relationship between the paladin 's oath and their god is ... unclear , at best ... but paladins do still get their power from a god in the realms . 
  do you `` need '' to ? 
  it 's not a rule that you have to . 
  but i would strongly argue that you * should * . 
  your patron is an important part of the flavour of a warlock , and if you are playing a warlock , having the patron play a major role in your character 's story is kind of essential . 
  any good dm will help facilitate this by having your patron interact with you somehow throughout the campaign , possibly even giving you a minor story arc revolving around it . 
  unfortunately the adventurer 's league is kinda terrible at this , because dms have to run premade adventures and have very little leeway to customise the adventure to the needs of the players , so you 'll always have a substandard experience . 
  i 'd highly encourage you to find a home game as soon as possible . 
   might be the use of \u00e6 ... which are n't really used in english, 
  the others definitely are n't , but this ligature does occasionally get used in english -- mostly british english and its closer relatives . 
  though it frequently will be written without the ligature , such as `` encyclopaedia '' rather than `` encyclop\u00e6dia '' , just because the symbol is n't on most keyboards . 
  they had better fucking support the world , too .
