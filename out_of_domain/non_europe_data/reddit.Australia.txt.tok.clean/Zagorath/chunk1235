  people wo n't jump through hoops with a vpn or whatever to watch the show semi-legally . 
  if they ca n't watch it on the same day as america , for the same price as america , we 're just gon na see it get torrented to buggery . 
  operating system should really be a checkbox option , not a radio button . 
  and linux should probably not be just `` ubuntu '' and `` arch linux '' . 
  at the * very * least , ubuntu should have been replaced with debian-based , to include ubuntu , all the ubuntu derivatives ( such as mint , xubuntu , or kubuntu -- my own preferred distro ) , as well as debian itself , and the handful of debian-based non-ubuntu-based distros out there . 
  currently , out of * all * that , only ubuntu is supported . 
  so right now , anyone who either : ( a ) uses multiple operating systems or ( b ) uses one of dozens of popular linux distros ( or ( c ) both ) is forced to use the `` other '' option , which is a sign of poor survey design . 
   right . 
  but does n't that also lock down installing software that would otherwise be fine ? 
  so , the default state of macos for the last four or so years ? 
  there 's absolutely ** no ** way that deal is exclusive . 
  for starters , what possible reason would netflix have for agreeing to it ? 
  but more to the point , look at how many dreamworks shows and movies are on netflix , let alone directly * produced * by them . 
  and that 's disney 's primary competitor , way more than dc ever could be . 
  for me the biggest question , apart from price , is what else will be on there ? 
  i 'm really hoping they 'll get the full archive of old dc shows , running all the way back to bruce timm 's dc animated universe . 
  it 'd be great to be able to watch those without torrenting . 
  i 'd also really like to see their more recent animated film universe movies , because i have n't seen any of those yet . 
  i 'm assuming you just copied and pasted the shift-option-k one ? 
  i ca n't see it right now because i 'm on my phone , which is android . 
  it 's the apple logo if you 're on an apple device . 
  on my kubuntu desktop yesterday i found it displayed a `` t '' inside angle brackets ( or , more probably , single guillemets ) and google suggested some linux distros use that character to display tux the penguin . 
   and i do n't need to be christian to notice all the people with ash on their forehead on the first day of lent every year . 
  that 's a thing in the us ? 
  i also live in a christian majority nation , but i have never seen that kind of thing . 
  though i think most aussies are largely xino . 
  they probably believe in the abrahammic god and his more moderate teachings , but rarely go to church or confession or participate in religious ceremonies . 
  i have n't got any data to back that assumption up though . 
  i honestly do n't even know precisely when ash wednesday/lent is . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's somewhere around march . 
  all i really know is that it starts with ash wednesday and i think it ends with something about pancakes . 
  but in general , yeah i agree . 
  simply living in a majority christian nation is enough to get to 10 in this quiz . 
  you absorb it through a sort of cultural osmosis . 
  this post is being removed . 
  see / u/phylea 's comment for why . 
  yeah the app is pretty frustrating actually . 
  it sends a totally unreasonable amount of notifications , with no way to customise how notifications work , and you ca n't add reactions to comments ( ffs , facebook messenger lets you do that on both mobile and desktop ) . 
   do n't go overboard with innovation and try to make it become the next snapchat like facebook messenger is, 
  urgh this . 
  six weeks ago i absolutely * loved * facebook messenger . 
  it was the perfect application for chat among friends and groups of friends . 
  not in competition with discord , because discord is more for anonymous online conversations around a particular topic , not chats with friends . 
  now they 've added this stupid fucking `` days '' thing that leaves a notification up that ca n't be gotten rid of , and there 's no way to turn it off . 
  for real though , why is there a separate subreddit for this ? 
  it 's not like there are two seasons running simultaneously and there needs to be separation to prevent people from getting confused ( though even * then * , some simple flair would probably solve the problem ) . 
  edit : this is * not * a rhetorical question . 
  i really would like to know the reasoning . 
  huh , that seems pretty petty . 
  has he abused modding powers in the past or something ? 
   dvorak users are ten times more likely to be using linux than the average population !, 
  part of this might be sample bias . 
  the correct statement is that dvorak using * redditors * are ten times more likely to use linux . 
  i suspect reddit users are substantially more likely to use linux than the standard population , which accounts for some of the difference . 
  though i also would n't be surprised if dvorak users are indeed more likely to use linux . 
  yup really . 
  long press lets you copy or , if it 's your own comment , edit or delete . 
  chuck and community only managed to get their 5 and 6 seasons , respectively , thanks to * massive * groundswells of support from fans , and with the concession of enormous distracting product placements . 
  community managed to use the product placements nicely and incorporate it into their story , but it was still an ad that should n't have had to be there . 
  and even then , chuck was treated poorly , getting only a half season for its final season , and being forced to write seasons 3 and 4 as if they would be finishing at the halfway point before extending to a full season midway through production . 
  ** and even then ** chuck 's final season had some cringeworthily bad effects , because of how much their budget got cut . 
  those scenes on the train in the antipenultimate episode had effects on the level that * i * could almost achieve , given a couple hundred bucks for props , lighting , etc. 
  hey , so the spoilertv.com post that announced the show was cancelled has now been updated to say that at some point the remaining episodes * will * be aired . 
  have you heard anything about this ? 
  oh , if you meant the characters , the reason is much simpler . 
  our main characters were friends with him long before they found out he was the son of the toyman . 
  there was already that preexisting relationship and built up trust . 
   there 's a few really obscure dc villains that could have been funny . 
  there 's a dude named sportsmaster who is , just , like really good at sports . 
  i think that 's selling him a little short on both fronts . 
  he might once have been obscure , but he was a major villain in the show young justice , so he 's not so obscure anymore . 
  and he 's a gadget-based villain . 
  kind of like if batman was a bad guy , and instead of being bat-themed , he was sports-themed . 
  exploding discuses , fencing swords , that kind of thing . 
  it seems to be mostly matt mercer stuff . 
  does he tone it down a little in this ? 
  from his videos on his main channel that i 've seen , i 've found the content pretty good , but the delivery way too over-the-top for an informational video . 
  whoa , i am * not * a fan of 100 . 
  it * might * be okay if the dm rolled for effects and only made it apparent what happened after the player did something to make it take effect ( though even then , most effects would result in an instantaneous description , so they 'd know this is a high likelihood ) . 
  but if the player rolls themselves , it 's just crazy strong . 
  it 's basically a free use of the * wish * spell , without the consequences . 
  is that ... special , on american airlines ? 
  i mostly fly on ultra budget airlines these days , but when i fly on `` normal '' airlines i 've always found that even in economy , you get free drinks . 
  yeah ... we 're gon na need a source -- and a reputable one , at that -- before we believe this claim . 
  it 's a little outlandish , really . 
   where do you think facebook gets its money from ? 
  uhh , it 's called advertising , mate . 
  it 's a multi-billion dollar industry , and facebook is * really * good at it . 
  regardless of what is or is not a desire path in the abstract , this subreddit 's definition is quite clear :, 
   ensure your path is an apparent disregard for designated paths . 
  and by that definition , this post is definitely * not * a desire path . 
  no diplomacy ? 
  you 've got ta get lords on your side to be able to convince your liege to give you territory . 
  if you start your own faction , you need to keep all your vassals happy or they 'll leave you for someone else . 
  you 're trying to take over calradia because historically it was a single kingdom and all the lords ultimately want to reunify it . 
  your cassus belli is the same as the one used to start the korean and vietnamese wars in real life . 
   if they are talking at all during combat ( which seems to be taking up time ) remind them that a combat turn should not exceed 6 second . 
  this includes their actions and anything they are saying . 
  obviously , they will take longer than 6 seconds to plan some things out , but if they are communicating , they would be unable to communicate anything that would take them longer than 6 seconds to say . 
  the problem with this sentiment is that it assumes all strategic communication happening at the table in combat would also be happening in that moment in character .
