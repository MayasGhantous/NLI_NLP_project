  but it would n't . 
  your characters are spending a lot more time with each other than actually gets roleplayed out , eating meals , travelling , resting , etc. , which frequently get skipped over in play . 
  what this means is that the characters are * necessarily * conversing about * something * with each other that the players are n't actually roleplaying explicitly . 
  and , because they 're adventuring together and facing a lot of combats together , some of that conversation is probably going to be discussing their abilities and possible strategies for using them in synergy . 
  when players talk strategy in combat , * this * is what 's coming to light . 
  the characters are n't * currently * discussing what they should do , they 're just playing out what they think would be best based on conversations that never explicitly happened at the table . 
  the problem with this sentiment is that it assumes all strategic communication happening at the table in combat would also be happening in that moment in character .

  i never looked before , but looking just now , it seems you guys do n't support tls/ssl ? 
  i do n't know why op was getting a significant security * error * , because i do n't get that in either chrome or firefox , but it definitely * is * secure , especially since it 's handling log ins , if there 's no ability to use https , let alone * automatically * using https . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  also consider looking at / r/dndhomebrew to see if your request has an answer there . 
  best of luck . 
   this has n't happened because it would be a lot of effort that would yield little else but negative criticism about something whose importance is marginal at best while requiring considerably more effort to fix . 
  this . 
  it would be like someone setting out to deconstruct all the technical computer jargon in modern tv shows ranging from csi to arrow . 
  you 'd gain absolutely nothing for your effort . 
  yup , those links are staying blue . 
  actually the ones in egypt are usually pretty well tied down . 
  it 's those damn mesoamerican ones you got ta watch out for . 
  urgh these episodes are so damn huge . 
  been downloading for like 10 minutes now . 
  seriously grey , compression is a thing !, 
  a 150 minute audio podcast has no business being over 200 mb . 
  in reference to the golf story , grey made the analogy to the robber in settlers of catan . 
  clearly , settlers is at the front of his mind right now . 
  this is 100 % evidence that the next video is going to be a settlers of catan video , and it 's going to be the best video that has ever been put out on youtube . 
  each month , if your total revenue is over a certain amount ( $ 100 is the figure on australian accounts , i dunno about others ) , you get a payout of whatever is in your account . 
  if you have n't reached that threshold , they hold it until you have . 
   this will forever be my one huge gripe with 5e . 
  this is like , the entire * point * of 5e . 
  if you do n't like that aspect of it , you really should be playing 3.5 e , or * maybe * 4e if you 're okay with social aspects being at the dm 's discretion but not combat . 
  that said , i do think one of the other great things about this edition is its incredible modularity , and it 'd be at least interesting to see crawford release his more complicated stealth rules , if they 're still compatible with the rest of the game . 
  once again , the sage advice segment on the podcast proves itself * immensely * valuable , in a way the text posts on the website never are . 
  the `` passive perception as a floor '' thing was particularly useful , and satisfies a question that i 've had for a long time , and i know i 've seen come up many times before . 
  still , i 'm left with one rather important question regarding ranged sneak attacks . 
  what if you 're behind an object like a wide tree , or around a corner ? 
  can you peep around the edge of the object to fire your bow without revealing yourself , or do you have to step out and reveal yourself ? 
  in the podcast they mostly seemed to be assuming some sort of cover that you can simultaneously be behind and shoot from , like heavy foliage . 
  cyclists are by law required to keep left and give way to pedestrians , except on dedicated cycle paths . 
  and , depending on the tone of voice she used , it was probably rude of her to be yelling at you to move . 
  but it 's also important for you as a pedestrian to be respectful . 
  if you and your group are taking up the entire span of the footpath , and * do n't * move to give the cyclist room to pass , you are * also * being rude . 
  any word on if they 're gon na let you create an account on the site , instead of making you sign up for a video streaming service to use a d&d campaign manager ? 
   the more people that try them out , the better . 
  they really are n't as bad as people make out . 
  my experience is the exact opposite . 
  i thought it was pretty okay in theory , but when i allowed a player at my table to play it ( with the restriction that i was ** not ** going to allow wu jen or nomad , because i do n't like their flavour at * all * ) , i realised how incredibly powerful it is . 
  it 's got better mobility than a monk , better healing than * anyone * except maybe life cleric , better damage resistance at low levels than a barbarian , as well as very good damage and social skills . 
  the damage resistance thing is because he chose the immortal discipline , but everything else is choices that * anyone * could make , because you 're not in any way restricted . 
  i ** loved ** the psion in 4e . 
  it was the first class i played with a character i made myself . 
  i loved the flavour of the far realm , i loved the concept of using your mind to mentally attack people , move things around , etc. 
  m'gann m'orzz was my absolute favourite character in the show young justice . 
  i also loved the mechanics . 
  you had a basic attack you could always use , but could spend psi points to upgrade that attack . 
  some abilities could require psi points to use at all . 
  it made the psion really unique and interesting . 
  because of how much i loved it in 4e , i ** wanted ** to like it in 5e . 
  but i just ca n't . 
  it lost the really interesting flavour in favour of being a weird mystical monk-like thing , and it went from being a really interesting but balanced mechanical class to being just straight up * too powerful * . 
  i do n't know how they could fix it , but top of my mind is that it really needs to be two to four * different * classes . 
  remove its ability to be simultaneously the best at three or four completely different aspects of the game . 
  and hopefully put back the good psionic flavour as well . 
  i think the whole idea is to * avoid * plane crash corner !, 
  regarding the yuan-ti and orcs , i do n't think they should count , because the monstrous races are ** not ** designed to be standard playable races . 
  i do n't think they should ever be compared with the standard playable races ( including not just the phb , but also the main ones in volo 's guide and the ee ones ) in terms of balance as a main player race . 
  personally , i see balance as very important , but of secondary concern to flavour . 
  and in most fantasy worlds , including the forgotten realms , humans are the race we most often see going on adventures . 
  so to me , a mechanic that encourages more people to play humans can * only * be a good thing , because it makes for parties that are more likely to look how they should . 
  i think a feat at first level is pretty much the * perfect * way to do it , because not only does it make them powerful enough to be worthwhile , but it also makes the human race incredibly * versatile * , and able to be really good at * any * one thing , which fits the flavour of the human really well . 
   unless you 're an avatar then you do n't add your casting modifier to the heal, 
  that 's the reason life clerics are better , but apart from that , they 're better than anyone else because their heals do n't have the restriction on undead and constructs . 
   then the barbarian has 12 +3 hp at level 1 , and the immortal mystic has 1d8 +1 +3, 
  that 's great , but it has * nothing * to do with damage * reduction * . 
  the immortal gets 5 thp ever round . 
  that means if they take anything less than 10 damage each round , they are taking less damage than a raging barbarian . 
  and they do n't have a limited resource requirement on their reduction . 
   it works quite well as is and allows for really flexible characters . 
  the problem is that it gives that flexibility not just in the character * building * space ( like the choice of a feat for a human ) , but you are * also * incredibly flexible while in play ( kinda like if the human was able to change their feat on a short rest or something ) . 
  and they do that * without * a significant trade off of power . 
  sure , they 're not the standout * best * at most things , but they can be built to be close to the best or sometimes equal the best at three or four things , and that means they can easily step on the toes of many people at once . 
  i think part of the problem many people have with tolkien is not tolkien himself , but that so many other settings are shallow copies . 
  they are superficially similar , but they lack the same incredibly rich history and culture that makes tolkien 's elves so great . 
  dwarves in many settings suffer the same fate , but even worse . 
  elves at least sometimes see superficial facelifts and have some reasonable attempt at justifying the flavour . 
  dwarves in most settings just lift * all * the superficial stuff * directly * from tolkien , but have basically * no * flavour behind it . 
  this question was answered * very * thoroughly in the thread on here when the service was first announced , as well as in a long thread on their official forums ( a link to which can be found in the aforementioned reddit thread ) . 
  that is correct , sorry if i was n't entirely clear . 
  what 's the value of displaying a show 's cv ? 
  would n't it be better to just show the std dev , so we can get a simple idea of how consistent each show is ? 
  also , what does the title refer to ? 
  `` dceutv '' ?
