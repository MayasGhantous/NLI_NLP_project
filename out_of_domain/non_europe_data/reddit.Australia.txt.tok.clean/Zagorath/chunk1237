  i 'm just a little confused . 
  but anyway , this is an interesting set of graphs , aside from those two questions . 
  good to see gotham is going really strong . 
  the cartoon *** young justice *** was my first serious foray into the world of shows based on comic book characters , and it made me absolutely fall * in love * with the dc universe . 
  i had watched some batman stuff , some spiderman cartoons , and some justice league as a kid , but watching young justice was the first time i sat down to seriously watch a show all the way through . 
  absolutely amazing show , 100 % recommend . 
  after falling in love with dc thanks to young justice , i figured taking a serious watch of the shows in the dc animated universe would be a good idea . 
  and it was . 
  *** batman : the animated series *** is without a doubt the ** best ** version of batman you will * ever * see outside of a comic book . 
  *** superman : the animated series *** made me actually enjoy superman and understand why he could be a popular character . 
  and justice league , while not as entertaining as young justice in my opinion , was a really strong show with some absolutely classic episodes . 
  if you 've seen the movie *** how to train your dragon *** ( which i would recommend , if you have n't ) , the tv show of that is also good . 
  the first two seasons are a little wonky , but they set up some great stuff . 
  once the show moved to netflix , it improved . 
  it 's still not a * fantastic * show , but it 's part of a universe shared with some of the best animated films this decade , and it helps flesh out that universe really nicely . 
  they do one thing excellently , though , and it 's some stuff with the villain around i think the fourth and fifth seasons ( counting season 3 as the first netflix season ) which is perhaps the best i 've ever seen a big bad handled in any show . 
  introduced first solely through whispers and built up as this incredible threat . 
  when we finally do see him , he * really * delivers , and becomes a fantastic intellectual threat to our protagonist . 
  he 's the * perfect * example of a reoccurring bbeg in a story with multiple threads . 
  the show is nowhere near as good as avatar , young justice , or the dcau shows are , but it does one thing way better , and that 's this one villain . 
  avatar never had particularly strong characterisations of its villains , in my opinion . 
  yeah when i was living on campus at uq i absolutely * loved * being able to stream any of the free to air stuff from my computer . 
  dunno if it 's available on all uni networks or just the resnet subnet , though . 
  that plus the inter-college peer-to-peer file sharing ( at the lightning-fast uni intranet speeds ) are two things i really miss . 
   no rebroadcasting going on at all, 
  uhh , rebroadcasting is literally the * only * thing this site does . 
  not that it 's not fantastic to have this available -- because it definitely is -- but there 's no way in the hells it 's legal . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
   they are freely available streams ... op is not making any money, 
  that just does n't matter . 
  the streams are copyrighted content , and the copyright holders have the rights to see that they are distributed only as they see fit . 
  they might decide to allow this to continue , and that would be fantastic !, 
  but they equally have the right to send a cease and desist and legally op would have to take it down if they do so . 
  we had the same problem in / r/unearthedarcana and / r/dndnext recently . 
  the publisher of d&d , wizards of the coast , has released a large amount of playtesting content for free to the public . 
  but because this content is not well formatted or organised , some members of the community decided to create a custom document containing all of these free articles along with some nicely formatted art etc. 
  but wizards decided they did n't like this , and they sent a cease and desist , so its creator has taken the compendium down . 
  i would argue wizards were being complete cunts by sending this ( and if this tv service gets taken down , i would say the same of whoever is responsible for that ) , but it is within their legal rights to do so . 
  just because something is freely available , does n't mean anyone can freely do whatever they want with it . 
  worth also noting , / u/john336kjb , that the skyui mod , one of the most basic and highly regarded mods ( all it does is provide a better menu interface for your inventory , spells , etc. , more designed for keyboard & mouse use , rather than console controller ) requires skse , and therefore wo n't work with the special edition . 
  i do n't think this could be related to that experiment . 
  the trick there is that you 're missing something that , in hindsight , is so incredibly obvious that you ca n't possibly imagine missing . 
  the specific details of a poker game in the show are easy to miss unless you * are * intently focussing on catching those details . 
  and in this case , there 's no reason that you would be . 
  generally , the specifics of the poker match are n't important , only the context in which the filmmakers set the poker match is ( in this case , the contrast between the senior and junior officers ) . 
  discord would * not * be liable for content uploaded by users , as they are protected by safe harbour provisions . 
  essentially , as long as they are n't encouraging illegal material , and they take necessary action against illegal material they are made aware of , they 're safe . 
  fucking hell and i thought my school was expensive . 
  my school charges $ 26,000 usd per year , and that was so expensive i never could 've been there were i not getting in free thanks to parents as teachers . 
  wtf ? 
  no oceania option for location ? 
  that 's a pretty damn huge area you 're ignoring ... 
   the tetanus vaccine is part of the childhood vaccination program in australia . 
  it is ? 
  i remember not getting a tetanus shot until i was about to go overseas . 
  really ? 
  the popular result has flipped now , bit i think the 6th is a much stronger symphony than the 7th . 
  it practically invented programme music , for god 's sake !, 
  not to mention , the whole thing , but * especially * the last two movements , are so incredibly * perfect * at conveying the scene that they are meant to represent . 
  it 's not as good as 3 5 9 , but it is still so close to perfection . 
  i 'd rate the 5th 's slow movement in third place too , but for me it 's behind 3rd and 7th . 
  i never really cared for the 9th 's middle movements . 
  it 's all about mvts 1 and 4 for me . 
  the storm and the shepherd 's song do n't do anything for you ? 
  you are n't human . 
   nothing beats the transition between 3rd and 4th movements of the 5th . 
  hnnnng, 
  but yeah , that is amazing . 
  also the brief reprise of the scherzo during the 4th movement . 
  more like your 5 best friends and their 4 friends . 
  i do n't . 
  first past the post is a bad system and it should feel bad . 
  there is no good reason to ever use it . 
  really the * best * thing to do here would be either irv or approval voting , with the `` winner '' each time being the one eliminated . 
  ( you could n't just do irv to choose the overall ranking , because you 'd end up with like four eliminated in the first round of eliminations , because everyone is voting 1 for symphonies 3 5 6 7 9 . ), 
  just off the top of my head , you could have a battlefield control based one ( a `` true psion '' , if you will ) with subclasses focussed on telepathy and telekinetics ; a damaging soulknife type class with subclasses focussed on various styles of fighting like sneaky , strategic , and in your face ; and a class based more on healing or buffing . 
  the mechanics i just described already suggest very clear flavour . 
  but why would you call it this ? 
  as far as i 'm aware , dc expanded universe is another name for the current dc cinematic universe , which none of these shows are a part of . 
  these shows are n't even a part of their * own * shared universe . 
  heck , they are n't even all ** dc ** shows . 
  shield is marvel , and the other shows are only * technically * dc , not part of what people normally associate with the brand . 
  point being , dceu does n't make any sense . 
   not sure what you mean by cv ? 
  sorry , cv is coefficient of variation : the standard deviation divided by mean . 
   if i did n't divide it by the mean rating , a show with 2m viewers and a standard deviation of 1m viewers would show as equally consistent as one with 10m viewers and a standard deviation of 1m . 
  well yeah , because both shows * are * equally consistent . 
  at least as far as i can tell . 
  in each case , 68 % of the time , the audience is within 1 million of its mean . 
  maybe the cv is a useful value to use here ; honestly , statistics has never been my strong point , but i 'm struggling to see * why * it would be better . 
   cgp grey said 10,000 views = ~ $ 1, 
  i ca n't remember if he said that , or if he said 1,000 \u2248 $ 1 . 
  my experience though has been the latter . 
  the amount of money in my adsense account currently is nearly exactly equal to the number of total views my videos have gotten divided by 1,000 . 
  that 's not a perfect comparison , because some of my most viewed videos ( which themselves are measured only in tens of thousands of views ) did n't have ads put on them until they had gotten a lot of views already , but the figure should still be approximately correct . 
  and this rings pretty much true to me in general . 
  ad rates are usually quoted in cpm , or cost per thousand views .
