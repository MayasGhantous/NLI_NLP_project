  a youtuber 's ad rate is well known to fluctuate somewhere in the range of $ 0.5 to $ 6 per thousand views ( to put an absurdly wide range on it , just to be safe ) . 
  not that that changes your point . 
  that 's still ~ $ 10 for the 10,000 views , and not enough to pay out . 
  it 's a pretty simple problem to describe in essence . 
  p is the set of all problems that can be solved `` quickly '' . 
  np is the set of all problems where , if you have a potential answer , you can * verify * whether or not that answer is correct `` quickly '' . 
  an example of a problem that is in p and np might be a sorting algorithm . 
  you can sort a list quickly , and you can check if a list is sorted quickly . 
  an example of a problem that is in np , but probably * not * in p is integer factorisation . 
  you can check which numbers are the prime factors of another number very easily , but finding them is believed to be hard . 
  the million dollar question is : is p equal to np ? 
  that is to say , can * any * problem where the answer is easy to verify also be solved easily ? 
  currently it 's believed the answer is no , but this has not been proven in a mathematical sense . 
  there are other related issues , like np-hard problems and np-completeness , and i would encourage you to read up on these because they 're very interesting . 
  i 've simplified the issue greatly for the purposes of a quick reddit comment . 
  you could take a whole university level course on it just to get an understanding of the concepts . 
  but hopefully this gets across the basic idea . 
   the combat in origins is really bad ( borderline unplayable ), 
  have to agree . 
  the worldbuilding was great , and the story was alright , but the combat was just gods damned * awful * . 
  after a while i turned the difficulty way down so that i at least never had to go over a fight multiple times , but even then it was still just a terrible experience . 
  once i had put the game down for a short time after finishing the main story , i could n't bring myself to pick it back up to play the expansion awakening . 
   point being that dceu television is n't a controversial label for these shows, 
  for * all * of these shows ? 
  i think i might have seen it used as another name for the arrowverse before , and * maybe * , * possibly * to refer to arrowverse + gotham . 
  but the idea of including izombie or aos in that is definitely foreign . 
   if we say that one show has a mean of 100 viewers and a standard deviation of 90 viewers , would you call that show more consistent than a show with one billion viewers and a standard deviation of 1000 ? 
  ignoring the presumed typo of 100 vs 1000 , you raise a really good point . 
  i think you 're right actually , using cv is probably a good idea in this case . 
  yeah i do n't get that bit . 
  are you familiar with the [ international music score library project ] ( http://imslp.org/ ) ? 
  they may not always be as easy to read as a good digitally engraved score , but they 're completely free , and enormously abundant . 
  you can print it yourself if you want a physical copy . 
  top of my recommendation list would be all the beethoven symphonies , especially 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 9 . 
  also tchaikovsky 's symphonies , mozart 's 40th and 41st , and mendelssohn 's a midsummer night 's dream overture, 
  i 'd really recommend checking out [ this series of videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc4ljc0rroo ) aimed to teach how to score read well . 
  that link is to the first video in the series , but there are a heap more that youtube should hopefully put in the `` up next '' for you , or in the sidebar . 
  the whole orchestration online youtube channel is immensely helpful . 
  it 's primarily aimed at composers and orchestrators ( of all skill levels ) , but many of the videos on there do this by essentially going through a guided score read . 
  oooh these are some great selections !, 
  i really do n't know why it is , because i loved * every * aspect of mass effect . 
  i really got in to the pausing and micromanaging how my party uses their powers . 
  but in dragon age that aspect was n't fun , it was tedious . 
   that must be how people feel who love the original witcher 's combat, 
  these people exist :o, 
  i mean , i do n't hate it as much as some seem to . 
  it 's awkward and unnatural , but it works , and to me it definitely is n't bad enough to make me not want to play the game . 
  but i ca n't possibly even * imagine * *** liking *** it . 
  so are `` fighter '' , `` rogue '' , and `` barbarian '' . 
  these suggest exactly the same type of flavour difference as those . 
  both swype and / r/subredditsimulator work using markov chains , so the results we 're seeing could be from any markov chain based input . 
   i flagged it as inappropriate ( harmful to device or data ), 
  is that an option you had ? 
  i did n't have that , so i just went `` other '' and basically said the app is fraudulent . 
   if your tax consultant said ` hey , wan na pay less tax ? ', 
  your brain probably is n't going to go straight to ` but i could spend years in jail ' . 
  yeah , because if my tax consultant said it , i 'd assume it 's probably not illegal . 
   likely wo n't be fixed, 
   if opposite teams scores within ( x ) seconds of you joining , it should be a save attempt, 
  very disappointed at this . 
  which is more likely , that someone ** gets all the way over to the other side of the map ** to be in * position * to save , but then * deliberately * lets them score * anyway * , or that someone only joins the game a few seconds before a cap that they could never have prevented is scored ? 
  the answer is obvious , and the * amount * difference in these two possibilities is enormous . 
  we already have rules about working against your own team . 
  at the very least , you could have this option on two flag maps and disable it on centre flag . 
  we can tell he 's in american eastern standard time zone , or utc-5 , because the time is precisely 5 hours before time 0 in unix epoch . 
  user : mindofmetalandwheels is brady confirmed ? 
  time 0 being 00:00 ( midnight ) on 1st january 1970 , utc , and ticking up by one every second since then . 
  it 's how computers store all time . 
  you mean getters and setters ? 
  up until a year or so ago , after you uploaded an image , you would get the image 's standalone page , like this one : http://imgur.com/nwls6w5 , which contained the image and some other stuff , including an easy to find direct image link . 
  for some reason they decided to change it so that after you upload an image , you 're sent to an album containing nothing but that image . 
  it 's * infuriating * . 
  nobody needs an album of just one image . 
  if , as i suspect , their reason was that they wanted to push more people to visiting the actual site , and make direct images less common , they could have * just * taken away the direct image url from the standalone image 's page . 
  but no , they decided to make it an album containing just that image . 
  *** why ***, 
  and they * did n't * take the opportunity to make it say '' ** sold ** with ass '', 
  hi / u/add0607 , thanks for posting to / r/unearthedarcana . 
  unfortunately , i have to remove this post for being in violation of post requirement 1 . 
  this subreddit is a place for sharing and evaluating new homebrew material , not for asking mechanical questions about existing stuff . 
  you should try submitting this to / r/dndnext . 
  i have contributed me idea of what i can see the lego movie in cinemas ( and i will be able to get a lot of people complaining about how poorly twf scales ), 
  and then the part in brackets loops ad infinitum . 
  ( brackets added manually after the fact . ), 
  i use pocket casts , why ? 
  i 'm reminded of [ this post ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2178r7/the _ story_of_the_drunken_fighter / ) from / r/dndgreentext 's [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  you got ta get to the end to see where the healing comes in . 
  also [ this blog post ] ( http://slushlush.com/2012/11/rules-of-engagement/ ) by d&d author erin m. evans , detailing how she used a particular type of d&d healing : 4e 's `` healing surge '' ( equivalent to the 5e fighter 's second wind ) in one of her novels . 
   wondering if there would be multiple topics or one per week ? 
  i think you 're misunderstanding what op is asking for . 
  they 're asking for a live/discussion thread for the abc 's q&a programme , not a general question and answer thread . 
  sorry , but this subreddit is for sharing roleplaying stories , not soliciting campaign request ideas . 
  you might be better off asking in / r/dnd or / r/dndnext . 
   it 's expensive, 
  for sure . 
  it 's much more than i would ideally like to pay . 
  but it 's no more so than the iphone , which comes with an operating system most people in here have zero interest in , and the samsung , which comes from a shitty company that puts shitty crap all over their phones . 
   has bluetooth issues, 
  i ca n't comment . 
  i never use bluetooth .
