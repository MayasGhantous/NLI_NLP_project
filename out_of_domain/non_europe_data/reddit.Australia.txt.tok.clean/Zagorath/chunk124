  i 'm not a big fan of his music in general , but he 's got heaps of concerti . 
  horn , piano , violin , clarinet , oboe , flute , flute and harp , bassoon , and probably more , ca n't think off the top of my head . 
  as a clarinetist i urge you to look at the copland and ebony concerti , and of course the weber concerti and concertino ( as well as the mozart , my favourite , as i mentioned above ) . 
  i 'm also fond of tchaikovsky and beethoven 's concerti , and rachmaninov for piano ( plus the rhapsody on a theme of paganini , which is solo piano plus orchestra like a concerto ) . 
  related to that would be rhapsody in blue , also solo piano and orchestra , though again not strictly a concerto . 
  edit : as a cool weird sort of one , rock band deep purple 's first big hit was concerto for group and orchestra , check that out on youtube . 
  i 've downloaded the entire omnibus set . 
  it 's absolutely awesome !, 
  thanks for that last paragraph . 
  not american here , and i never would have noticed that 's what the point of this picture is ... 
  i love watermelon , but hate having to deal with the seeds , and hate the taste close to the skin . 
  for me it 's mid-high far-left on [ the fruit scale ] ( http://xkcd.com/388/ ) . 
  then say it like that , and write it in short in a logical manner of either ascending or descending scale . 
  but you can also say `` 21st december '' without all the extra words . 
  it would n't be considered odd . 
  uhh ... no ... why ? 
  got ta be honest mate , it sounds to me as if coming from a military background and finding it easy is probably a `` duh '' moment . 
  edit : oo , i got to give you your 200th upvote !, 
  yeah because it 's ascending . 
  it 's much easier to intuit , you can more naturally glance at it and know which one 's which . 
  writing dates short form is n't about language it 's about utility . 
  same . 
  i put `` n/a , i 've never played it '' . 
  i assume that 's just to prove you 're a real person . 
  obviously i ca n't prove or disprove it , but from an objective standpoint i believe it 's more natural to have things in order rather than jumbled up going medium-small-large . 
  sure once you 're used to it there 's very little difference ( the fact that the us is different to the rest of the world can cause confusion , but that 's not the main issue ) , but learning it at first one is clearly more natural . 
  base 10 is used largely because we have 10 fingers . 
  for base 12 you can use other methods ( maybe 10 fingers + 2 feet , or 12 segments of 4 fingers on one hand ) , and that allows allows it to potentially work very well , and there are obviously many functional advantages of it -- even if it might be a little harder to learn initially . 
  there are no functional advantages to mm/dd/yyyy . 
  edit : i should add , good job trying to force me to prove my belief . 
  i doubt i 'll convince you of it , but it 's been a good discussion to strengthen my reasoning for it . 
  i was the opposite . 
  i found terms 1 and 2 of the first year really easy , and started having trouble term 3 and then all of second year . 
  term 3 second year became easier after ias were completed and the workload dropped , but then of course the stress of exams started .

  that way you get one extra story in there . 
  brass would be second worse , especially in classical-era and early romantic music . 
  surprised no one 's said it yet : silent night if john cage wrote it . 
  nah bullets are safe . 
  it 's only when you fire them out of the gun you got ta worry . 
  you 've missed the point . 
  babies * ca n't * give consent , and so the procedure should not be forced upon those too young to give consent . 
  when a person becomes an adult and can give informed consent ( without too much influence from parents as would happen if you did it at an earlier age like -- say -- 13 ) , if they then want it they can have the procedure . 
  they had a blog post recently ( well , not that recent ) where they said they 'd implemented counters do this would n't work anymore . 
  dunno if they 've actually done it or if it works , though . 
  thats the catch . 
  youtube does n't use dmca for its claims , just its own internal system . 
  it now requires dmca for takedowns if the user launches a complaint , but it still defaults to its internal system . 
  i 've heard this exact story or variations of it many times . 
  google really needs to step up their game with this stuff ... 
  hahaha , i was away from internet and did n't even notice . 
  and then i accidentally deleted the comment - . - damn alien blue does n't warn you . 
  accidentally press `` delete '' once and it 's gone forever . 
  op usually is dumber than whatever they 're criticising . 
  and the republicans , fuck them too . 
  nah , do n't think so . 
  ( not sure how much i had left from when someone else gave me gold , but i 'm strongly leaning towards that i did n't lose anything . ), 
  i know i definitely did n't lose the karma points from it . 
  since * birth * ? 
  damn , you must be ** young ** . 
  have you even * glanced * at the rest of the thread ? 
  one guy almost had sex with his uncle ... 
  the latter also has among the worst socio-economic mobility in the world . 
  worse even than the united states which is close behind . 
  ( i 'm thinking the graph of this i 've seen a few times is probably only of developed counties . ), 
  it 's tuned in fourths , not fifths like the violin , viola , and cello , all of which are members of the violin family . 
  to be honest , a standard macbook pro 15-inch ( since 13s do n't have dedicated graphics ) can play virtually any game you throw at it , maybe not at highest settings , but it 'll run . 
  just need bootcamp . 
  i agree . 
  i just got a new macbook pro and i looked at the retina but it just was n't even close to worth the extra price . 
  got the plain 15 inch one . 
  great specs , i can use dvds and ethernet ( unfortunately where i 'll be staying for uni first have wifi ... ) , and i get way more storage ( i do aheap of video of photo stuff , so as much as i 'd love the super fast speeds of an ssd , i need the space more ) . 
  there 's virtually no advantage to the retina really . 
  as a user of both mac and windows . 
  same question . 
  if you 're saying that you 've clearly never actually used a mac and os x. 
  it 's not better than windows overall , i would say it 's every bit as good on average though . 
  it really depends on what you want it for . 
  what you do get with a mbp , though , is the absolute best laptop in the world . 
  i personally would n't want a mac desktop -- i love the awesome customisability and power of a purpose built ( i.e. , not off-the-shelf ) windows machine to sit on the desk -- but i would equally be very hesitant to buy a windows-based laptop ever again . 
  the build quality and reliability is second to none . 
  sure you pay out the nose for it , and if you 're on a tight budget there are brilliant alternative options , but in my mind if cost is not an obstacle and you buy a windows laptop you 're crazy . 
  i dunno , i 've never used spotify ( do n't even know if it 's available in australia , and it certainly was n't available in vietnam where i lived until recently -- * edit : to clarify , i lived in vietnam until recently , not spotify was n't available until recently * ) , but these do seem to me like serious problems . 
  when i listen to music i do it most often by composer , but it sounds like they do n't have that in their metadata , which is a bloody serious problem . 
  itunes annoys me in how poorly it handles metadata for anything other than plain pop - or rock-style music ( classical and film particularly , but also a lot of jazz and world music ) , but i stick with it because there 's no real alternative ( itunes as a media library , not as a music store ) in terms of better metadata features . 
  i 'm a big metadata junky , and i want to be able to search by conductor , orchestra , soloist , composer , or any individual piece of metadata that could be relevant . 
  failing that , at the ** very least ** they need to have the composer in there somewhere . 
  really ? 
  i do n't know about how you listen to music , but for me that seems a ** massive ** thing to complain about . 
  the composer is the number two thing i consider when choosing what to listen to , only just beaten out by genre ( sonata , quartet , symphony , etc. ) . 
  if i ca n't search `` elgar '' and have a number of compositions by edward elgar come up to the top , then it 's a service of very limited use to me . 
  edit : i should mention , i say this as someone who has n't used spotify , my download allowance is far too limited to regularly stream music , and i prefer to own the music anyway . 
  seems pretty cool , far better than itunes , but still not quite what i 'm looking for . 
  so i decide i want to give it a go . 
  head to the download page , look around for any option that lets you choose your operating system . 
  do n't see one , assume it automatically detects and gives you the relevant one ( side note : that 's a great feature when implemented , but should also always be accompanied by custom options if you want to download on one computer to install on another ) , alright , click download . 
  i keep my music on my mac , so that 's bloody useless . 
  search around , turns out there 's a download in the `` addon '' section claiming to work for mac , but wo n't work with other addons , or recognise usb devices ... so that 's almost worse than nothing ( gets your hopes up before letting you down ) , not to mention it 's not native , it 's a wine package .
