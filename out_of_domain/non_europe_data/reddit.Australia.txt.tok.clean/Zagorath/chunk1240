  considering * fireball * is a 3rd level spell , getting that completely for free , or an enormous buff on top of it for less than the amount it would cost to cast a * fireball * ( and equal to the amount you would get by sacrificing a third level slot ) is painfully powerful for a 6th level archetype ability . 
   hive mind hub has the potential to be really really really strong , seeing as it has no limit on number of creatures you can attune to , or the range they should be from you . 
  i did n't think of that . 
  in my mind the character was only using it to attune with their own party members . 
  that 's a really good point . 
  i suppose my suggestion would be to making it so you can attune to a number equal to your intelligence modifier . 
  hang on , you only got half of the mozart starter pack there !, 
   it also indicates i feel that bruce is in the himalayas i guess, 
  yeah i thought that much was pretty clear . 
  i did n't know what they said , but it was obvious while i was watching the episode that the script was the one used in hindi , so it had to be the himalayas . 
  this is a pretty easy choice , really . 
  as important as it is historically , the 3rd just is n't quite the same level as the 5th . 
  the 5th is basically a perfect symphony . 
  the first movement builds a near perfect example of the sonata form from the simplest motif possible . 
  its two themes show a brilliant contrast between the darkness and the light , and the change from horn to bassoon in the announcement of the second theme during the recapitulation is one of the most brilliantly considered choices out there . 
  not to mention the awesomeness of the bassoon countermelody in the first theme of the recapitulation . 
  and the incredible oboe solo , and its piercing long notes in the 13 or so bars right after it . 
  then the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th movements all manage to in some way incorporate that same main motif , something so rarely done at all , and never done to quite the same extent and effectiveness as beethoven achieves here . 
  the attacca from the third to fourth movements , and latter the reoccurrence of the third movement 's motif within the fourth movement , are some of the most chilling moments in the classical literature . 
  the third symphony might have expanded the horn section a little , but the fifth is basically responsible for popularising the use of piccolo and trombone in symphonic music . 
  so yeah , for me this is an incredibly obvious choice . 
  the third symphony is the third best .

  hey , i 've flaired this `` world '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  under a somewhat more useful [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/ ) system , i would argue that hardline ` the government should n't be looking at anything of citizens ' is a viewpoint that technically belongs on the ` libertarian ' side , i.e. , negative values on the y ( social policy ) axis . 
  in practice , i would say this is only partly true . 
  if you want to use final cut pro , which is * without a doubt * the best editor out there for small and medium scale projects , yeah , i 'd say it 's worth it . 
  if you want to use any other editor , like the avid or adobe options , which tend to be more widely used in large scale ( feature length film ) productions , then there is very little reason to get a mac . 
  they run perfectly fine on windows laptops , and over the past four or five years manufacturers of laptops running windows have started making not-shit laptops . 
  the overall experience is still not as good as a mac , but it 's now close enough that if you really do need the power required for video editing , and are price sensitive , it 's a very good option . 
  if you do get a refurbed mac , make sure it 's one with a discrete graphics card . 
  apple has ( very annoyingly ) been increasingly stingy over the past 5 years with their internal hardware . 
  i have a 2012 non-retina macbook pro , and that was , in my opinion , the last time apple made a reasonably priced powerful laptop . 
  they discontinued that a few months after i got mine . 
  today , to get a laptop with a discrete graphics brand new costs -- and i * really * wish i was joking or exaggerating here -- $ 3,600 , at a minimum . 
  that 's worse than it was a year ago , which was worse than back in 2012 , which was in my opinion the peak of the mbp . 
  i do n't know how much one will cost refurbed , but hopefully an early 2016/late 2015 model with a graphics card is pretty reasonable . 
  as far as i can tell , the turkish government is unhappy about things like describing the armenian genocide , a fact which the turkish government denies was real , as well as other more recent events which paint the turkish government in a less than stellar light . 
  the 5th gets played so much because it is fucking close to perfect . 
  which , to be fair , so is the 3rd , but the 3rd has the disadvantage of being not quite as iconic , and lacking such genius touches as the entire first movement being based off of a single four note motif , the brilliant attacca from third to fourth movements , and including a reprise of the third movement within the fourth . 
  real like it 's one of the most well-attested to acts of genocide in history , and is near unanimously accepted among academics . 
  the denial in which the turkish government persists ( and i had hoped/assumed that most turkish people would be in disagreement on this front , because everything i 've heard has suggested they are some of the kindest people in the world ) is on the same level as pretending the holocaust did n't happen , or that pol pot 's dictatorship was benign . 
  i would have assumed that , at least on this site with its relatively well-educated audience , mentioning the genocide would be a pretty uncontroversial comment , which is why it 's the only one i explicitly mentioned , rather than more recent political events which might be seen as more inflammatory . 
  those `` river lands '' are fucking weird , and near ambrija you seem to have a pair of rivers that run into a lake with no outlet . 
  these do happen , but usually either really fucking big lakes ( e.g. 
  caspian sea ) or in the desert . 
  this is because , to put it simply , if more water is coming in than going out ( via evaporation , human/animal usage , etc. , but mostly evaporation ) , it 'll eventually overflow and head towards the sea . 
  the coastlines need a * lot * of work , especially the islands in the halfling isles , and the fjords in the north . 
  i do n't know what the scale of this is meant to be , but the gap between the mainland and the dragon isle looks to be too big for there to be a bridge , unless the bridge was built and is maintained by magic ( or modern levels of engineering and material science ) . 
  and finally , i personally would be tempted to swap the font size within `` free city ^ of ^ ( aldaraas ) '' to '' ^ free ^ city ^ of aldaraas '' , but maybe that 's just me . 
  jokes need to be funny . 
  this can come from many places , but frequently it means having some small basis in truth . 
  there 's nothing funny about just making random shit up . 
  that 's what you did here . 
   ** jokes need to be funny ** ... ** there 's nothing funny about just making random shit up **, 
  i mean , / u/koiq 's comment in that thread pretty much perfectly explains exactly why it * is n't * gatekeeping . 
  i think you 're misusing the term ad hominem there mate , for a bunch of different reasons . 
   i 've interacted with enough diaspora armenians to come to the following conclusion : even if a turk accepts the genocide , the diaspora armenians will still act like a total asshole towards them, 
  then that is a slight on them and their personalities , but it 's not a valid excuse for denying the fact that the armenian genocide occurred . 
  no one in their right mind would claim that a jewish person being a dick to some germans justifies holocaust denial ; it just means that jewish person is an arsehole . 
  umm , no , but is there a problem with yours ? 
  if they act like arseholes , then * that is a slight on them * . 
  it 's not something that justifies denial of history , or defending those who do deny history . 
  it 's mainly the implicit defence of those who do deny it of which your previous comment contained undertones , based on the context of this thread and the comment to which it was replying , which i was aiming to refute . 
  i never meant to imply that you yourself were denying it . 
  as for how the holocaust compares to other genocides , it 's not quite as far off as you 'd think , although it depends on exactly how you choose to define `` worst '' . 
  pol pot killed as many as a third of the * entire population * of his country , including every single one of the viet people within his borders . 
  so for percentage of total population or percentage of a single ethnic group within the country , he `` beats '' even the nazis . 
  for raw number of human lives , china 's `` great leap forward '' is probably the winner . 
  of course , i do n't at all want to understate how horrible the holocaust was . 
  on a balance of how systematically targeted it was and the total scale , it 's hard to say there has ever been an event worse than it . 
  my point is merely that it is unfair to too easily dismiss events like the armenian genocide , the khmer rouge regime , or mao 's china as being incomparable . 
  from the way they worded it , i think the placement was a requirement of the degree . 
  they do it in engineering , too . 
  you have to do 60 days of engineering-related work placement to graduate . 
  i think it 's a requirement unis pass down from engineers australia . 
  although in that case we were told you generally are expected to be paid . 
  more than just loud , i would play it as though every note except those semiquavers is accented , kind of like it 's being very carefully and deliberately * placed * in its spot . 
  pffft , this is hilarious . 
  rhyming mahogany with agony got a right proper snort out of me . 
   the first bar is usually shortened in most pieces , probably because later on it 'll merge and be part of a full tempo measure in a repetition , but not necessarily, 
  what you 're referring to here is called an anacrusis , or upbeat . 
  and it most certainly is not in `` most pieces '' . 
   the second bar of this treble clef has actually 2 tempos, 
  first , the plural of tempo is temp * i * . 
  it 's italian . 
  but more to the point , the term your looking for here is `` voices '' . 
  a single staff can have multiple voices which represent independent rhythmic or motivic ideas . 
  very common and standard in piano scoring and i 'm not sure why you 'd feel the need to explain it to someone asking specifically about a musical interpretation . 
   for the notation i 'd try to ... play it as it is, 
  that 's * most * helpful ...
