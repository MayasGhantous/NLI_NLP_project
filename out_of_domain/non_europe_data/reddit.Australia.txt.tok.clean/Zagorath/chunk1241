  for example , while the brits exclusively use `` lift '' , we use lift and elevator interchangeably . 
  a brit 's `` sweet '' or american 's `` candy '' is our `` lolly '' . 
  we also refer to both british `` crisps '' and american `` french fries '' as `` chips '' . 
  a lot of unique aussie vocab comes in the form of rhyming slang ( brought down from cockney rhyming slang , but we have our own specific examples of it ) , or by just shortening something ( or sometimes lengthening ) and ending in `` o '' or `` ie '' . 
  the most obvious example being `` aussie '' short for `` australian '' , or names like `` davo '' from `` david '' . 
  but there are * heaps * more examples of that which are possible . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  it 's really very simple . 
  an ad hominem is refuting someone 's * argument * because of who they * are * , or possibly because of one of their stances on an unrelated topic . 
  what i came close to ( but did n't quite do , as i 'll get to in a minute ) was attacking the * person * because of the * argument * , which is quite the opposite of an ad hominem , since the argument is being refuted on its own ( lack of ) merit . 
  but i was n't really even quite doing that , because indeed as you 'll notice , i started under the assumption that most modern turkish people , or at least most of those on reddit , would actually be knowledgeable enough and politically open enough to accept the truth here . 
  my comment was n't specifically insulting an entire populous , but merely insulting any people who hold one specific belief , with the note that i am * worried * that perhaps a significant number of people from one particular populous * might * be more likely to hold that erroneous belief . 
  i 've frequently found that the first section of lost mines of phandelver works really nicely as an intro adventure . 
  up until and including the goblin cave . 
  it 's pretty much exactly the right amount of time for one session , and it gives you a perfect place to pick up in the next session , if they decide to keep going . 
  also the `` redshirts are most likely to die '' meme [ is n't true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grp92hxdlgy ) . 
  the contrapositive might be correct , but the most dangerous colour shirt to be wearing in the original series is gold . 
   i needed some inspiration on the hell for my tiefling player, 
  highly highly ** highly ** recommend the brimstone angels series by erin m. evans . 
  the main character is a tiefling warlock , so we get to see a lot about how tieflings are thought of in the realms , as well as a lot of awesome political machinations of the hells via the character 's patron . 
  the whole series is absolutely fantastic and i can not recommend it enough , * especially * for someone interested in the hells and or tieflings . 
  the first few books are technically 4e , but not a lot of lore changed between 4e and 5e for the hells , in practical terms . 
  and all the books from the adversary ( which was part of the sundering series ) onwards are set in roughly 5e times . 
  the last couple of books make it very clear that they are taking place at the time of out of the abyss and storm king 's thunder , respectively . 
  your pronunciations were actually surprisingly good in this . 
  asmodeus is one that most people i know ( including myself , until i heard it in an audiobook , and then went to look it up ) get wrong , but you got it right . 
  there were a couple of minor stress issues . 
  it 's stygia , not stygia , and azuth , not azuth , but for the most part your pronunciations seemed spot on . 
   they tried to do the classic `` flip the stories on their head '' with luke leaving the girl at the end and the car being stolen, 
  that was a flip ? 
  both of those are exactly what i expected from the very start . 
  i spent all that time writing out how i wanted it capitalised for a fucking reason , not for you to automatically change the second one to match the first . 
  it 's stygia , not stygia . 
  drupal and wordpress ( self-hosted at least ) allow you to use pre-made themes which have built-in customisation options , or use your own custom css . 
  wordpress alone runs over 55 % of all websites on the internet , and combined with drupal it 's over 60 % . 
  mediawiki , the software behind the entire wikimedia foundation ( including wikipedia , wiktionary , etc. ), 
  as well as what 's running on all sites on the wikia network has the same two levels of customisability . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   the plaintiff wo n't be owed money if he wins , because his student still has never won a court case, 
  this is why it 's * not * a paradox . 
  that claim is incorrect . 
  if the plaintiff wins the case , it means the court has decided that there * was * an implied clause in the contract that the defendant has to go into the legal profession and that , because he did not do this , he must pay up . 
   senators would represent varying worlds or sectors across the galaxy , while junior representatives could voice the opinions of a minority population or political party of an already represented planet . 
  despite this position , the representative could not actively vote on or introduce new legislation , but could perform these duties if the instated senator was on a leave of absence or otherwise unavailable . 
  [ source ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/galactic_senate ), 
  so basically , jar jar was a `` junior representative '' , as he represented the gungans , a minority population of the planet naboo . 
  he could n't vote or introduce legislation , except when he acted as interim senator for naboo when senator amidala was absent ( which is what was the case when he proposed giving the chancellor emergency powers ) . 
  also , / r/australia , i am very disappoint . 
  i came here expecting someone to have done the research for me already , not having to do it myself . 
   attack rolls against the creature have advantage . 
  note that being prone means attacks from further than 5 feet have * disadvantage * to hit you . 
  the advantage from being unconscious and disadvantage from being prone cancel out to result in a normal roll . 
  it 's still an auto crit if it hits , though . 
  at the very least , i kinda like the idea of allowing wizards to use their spellbook as an arcane focus . 
  just a tip , litre is abbreviated l , not l. it 's ml , not ml . 
  would n't it be easier to just work in standard drinks ? 
  just look at the side of the bottle/glass/can and add up how many it is . 
  unless you can find some particular * semantic * reason that certain things would be in the left column and others in the right , i 'm against this . 
  it makes searching for what you 're looking for more difficult, 
  you are aware that rabbits are a pest in this country , right ? 
  hunting rabbits is literally no different , morally , than putting down rat traps . 
  oh right yeah . 
  i misread that . 
  what this does is cause the eye to have to move both left and right * and * up and down , while searching for the same thing . 
  if there were a semantic difference between each column , that 's fine , but when categories ( or even worse , specific options ) are arbitrarily scattered across the two columns , that 's bad design . 
   you 're not being confused by the fact i copied and pasted the settings from the left over to the right are you ? 
  no , i 'm not confused by that . 
  although it certainly does n't help . 
  if you could provide a concrete example of how you would split things , that might help . 
  yes , but * which * half goes on which side ? 
  because if a user ca n't instantly and intuitively know * which * side to look on , you 've just doubled their workload by needing to scan on two axes instead of just one -- bad design . 
  exif data can be forged quite easily . 
   kenku are crows not ravens, 
  not to pull a unidan here , but there 's no taxonomical difference between crows and ravens . 
  there are a number of different species of `` crow '' and `` raven '' , but they are all related at the same taxonomical level : all under the same genus . 
   the latest ranger is really powerful for a one level dip, 
  still not as powerful as the ambuscade ranger was . 
  it turns out that wordpress.com also allows fully customised css , [ if you have the premium or business plan ] ( https://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-css/ ) . 
  why bother ? 
  we all know this is n't even going to be close . 
  it does n't even matter that the wrong decision was made in the last round . 
  apparently it 's something wagner once called the 7th . 
  i think i 've finally found a subtitle that 's even dumber than `` fate '' . 
  i doubt they 'd bother . 
  they 'd never make any money from it . 
  if the price is too high they 'd get only a miniscule percentage of subreddits , and if it 's low enough that a significant amount of subreddits get it , it 'd be a really small revenue stream , since the subreddit : user ratio is so low .

  my suggestion for homebrew is : ** only ** allow stuff that has either been reviewed on / r/boh5e , or has been posted on / r/unearthedarcana and seems to have received mostly positive feedback . 
  all other forums where homebrew is commonly found are set up in such a way as to discourage feedback and iteration , and as such they attract communities that are not interested in those things , and that in turn results in lower quality material . 
  this is why i very specifically suggest people look for stuff that has received * good feedback * , and not base what homebrew they allow on upvotes . 
  there have been studies either way , which is why it 's better , in this kind of situation , to look at meta-analyses . 
  [ this 1997 meta-study ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2127653/ ) showed a 24 % increase in risk of lung cancer in non-smokers who live with someone that smokes . 
  this was revised down to 15 % in 2000 by another study that tried to further take into account biases in the studies used by the first meta-study . 
  [ the iarc , in 2004 , performed its own meta-analysis ] ( http://monographs.iarc.fr/eng/monographs/vol83/index.php ) , and declared :, 
   these meta-analyses show that there is a statistically significant and consistent association between lung cancer risk in spouses of smokers and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke from the spouse who smokes . 
  the excess risk is of the order of 20 % for women and 30 % for men and remains after controlling for some potential sources of bias and confounding . 
  is ... is berlioz referring to himself with the royal we ? 
  the closest thing i can think of is hemomancy/blood mages , of which there have been * many * different attempts , using many different game mechanics , including classes , subclasses , and even prestige classes . 
  it 's not exactly the same , but you might be able to use it as a starting point . 
  yeah i 'd be interested in seeing them .
