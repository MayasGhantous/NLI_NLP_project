  but what about a greater enemy that is * indirectly * responsible for the plot ? 
  that 's where this trope comes in . 
   a greater scope villain is a threat that 's more dangerous , affects more people , or a villainous presence that is more significant than the story 's current big bad * in the setting as a whole * , but is n't causing the conflict of * the immediate story * ( and may have little to do with it at all ) . 
  while the big bad is directly responsible for the current story -- the big bad is the villain or situation that the protagonists are attempting to defeat or overcome -- a greater scope villain is n't a major force in the plot . 
  they are just responsible for anything evil or fueling at least a part of the fictional setting ( how much of it depends on the scale of the greater scope villain 's influence ) in which the story takes place . 
  a greater scope villain may be the big bad 's superior , but just as often they 're completely unrelated -- indeed , a greater scope villain may threaten the big bad just as much as they threaten the protagonists . 
  whatever the relationship between the big bad and greater scope villain , the greater scope villain is always out of focus -- the threat they pose is general and in the background , while the threat posed by the big bad is specific and immediate . 
  think the dark dragon in most of american dragon , ozai in seasons 1 and 2 of avatar , morgoth in both of tolkien 's main novels , sauron during the hobbit , palpatine during all star wars films except 3 , 6 , and 7 , snoke in episode 7 , thanos in the mcu , and the reapers in mass effect 1 ( and maybe , arguably , 2 ) . 
  and , of course , darkseid in seasons 1 and 2 of young justice . 
  i mean , if you have to go all the way back to the most basic root word in pie , for two words that intuitively * seem * like they 'd probably come from the same latin word or even more recently through old french , i 'd say that 's close enough to call it a false cognate for practical purposes . 
   it feels like they only animated every other frame to save money . 
  this is called animating on twos , and it 's * extremely * common in both high and low budget traditionally animated works . 
  anime is famous for nearly always shooting on threes , meaning three frames per drawing . 
  in that case , they often are sacrificing fluidity of motion for high quality artwork and shading . 
  most western animation for tv is twos , and aside from disney a lot of films are on twos as well . 
  [ this article helps explain a lot of the differences ] ( https://myanimelist.net/featured/1737/anime_vs_cartoons__a_comparative_analysis ) , as well as why despite being in threes or fours , anime often looks better than low budget western stuff that 's in twos or threes . 
  the article also goes in to some unrelated points because it 's only using the ones , twos , threes stuff as a single argument in its more general comparison of the two cultures ' animation . 
  just ctrl-f `` ones '' to find the relevant bit . 
  for me , the biggest failure of yahoo screen was that i could n't fucking use it . 
  for the first few episodes i tried using a proxy or vpn to get it to work , but that became too much of a pain and was n't working properly , so i ended up resorting to other methods to watch the show . 
  i 'm really hoping the dc service is going to be * globally * available for a reasonable price . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` mechanic '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  title says devil , throughout the story it says demon . 
  which is it ? 
  ` & nbsp ; ` needs the semicolon to & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; work . 
  i do n't think we can say yet . 
  we do n't have enough details . 
  we know young justice will be on it , and like one other show , i think ? 
  the question of whether it 's good or not depends on a lot of other details . 
  how good is their * tech * ? 
  a lot of streaming services result in enormous amounts of buffering , if you try to skip forward through an episode it might freeze entirely , etc. 
  even today this is a problem . 
  how good is their * content * ? 
  young justice alone will not be enough to keep people coming back . 
  if , on the other hand , they have a strong backlog of stuff : all of bruce timm 's dc animated universe shows and films ; the more recent dc animated film universe films ; maybe even the arrowverse shows and dc cinematic universe films , once the shows ' seasons are finished , and the film has come out on dvd ; older films like the nolan and burton/schumacher batman films , the reeve superman films , and superman returns ; standalone cartoons like teen titans and the various batman shows ; and a selection of more niche things such as birds of prey and dc super hero girls . 
  not saying they need * all * of that , but they need a good strong selection of stuff to keep the streaming service relevant outside of just young justice . 
  how good is their * price * and * availability * ? 
  they * have * to recognise that the appeal of this is * much * more limited than netflix and its more standard competitors . 
  they ca n't charge as much as it does : not even close . 
  if their price is more than half of netflix 's most basic plan , i 'm calling it dead on arrival . 
  and even that is probably pushing it . 
  and it also needs to be globally available for that same price . 
  at the very least , they need the english speaking countries , western/central europe , and probably brazil and mexico . 
  none of these questions have even slightly been answered yet . 
  until they are , i do n't think we can even begin to pass judgement . 
   everything from ten titans, 
  pretty sure there were only 5 main titans actually :p, 
  or like ... over 20 if you count all the honorary titans . 
   nothing can even claim to be on the same level . 
  i would argue that both batman : the animated series and avatar : the last airbender are on the same level , albeit for different reasons . 
   my older sister , who did n't like superheroes at all a year ago , now loves all things superheroes . 
  hahahaha . 
  i have exactly the same story , except it 's younger sister , and more like two or three years ago . 
  she was reluctant to watch the show because she liked teen titans , but had no more serious interest in comic book stuff . 
  once i made her watch it , she got way more into comics than me . 
  i watch the shows and stuff but that 's it . 
  she 's full in to the actual comic books , fan fiction , merchandise , etc. 
  while i can totally believe trump * would * do something like this , and i vaguely recall him doing something similar in the past , in this particular instance , it 's not trump to blame . 
  it 's reuters . 
  trump was talking * to * turnbull and said that `` you have better healthcare than we do . '', 
  reuters is reporting this as trump saying that quote to `` brian trunbull '' . 
  trump never mentioned the guy 's name at all . 
  yeah it does n't help that the adjectival form of the country ( including the demonym ) is *** canadia *** n.

   why do they have mrs. pots sing the `` beauty and the beast '' song, 
  i have n't seen the new one , but mrs. pots is the one that sings it in the original , so it sounds like they were just being faithful to it .

  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge .

  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an * appropriate * flair to your submissions . 
  if one is * writing * in the * style * idiomatic to the greentext format , it 's best if they also * display * it as if it 's greentext . 
  to do otherwise would be like writing a poem out in a single big block of text . 
  of course , we do n't actually require that stories be in the greentext format ; prose is perfectly acceptable on this subreddit . 
  we just prefer that if the style of writing is clearly that of a greentext , you also use the syntax so it will display as such . 
  yikes , this is crazy overtuned . 
  when you first pick it up , you get :, 
  * proficiency with longbows and heavy crossbows, 
  * +1 per d6 to your sneak attack damage when using crossbows, 
  * advantage using a bonus action , once per short rest, 
  * * except no , you actually get it on a recharge 5 -- 6 , assuming you use either disengage or hide as a bonus action ( which many rogues will be doing most of the time * anyway * , especially ranged ones ) . 
  never mind that the whole idea of a class feature that 's `` recharge 5 -- 6 '' is ridiculous . 
  literally no other class feature in the game works this way . 
  the only way for * any * player to be exposed to this is through shapeshifting or * polymorph * ing into a beast with a recharge ability . 
  but never mind that , the cheap advantage is way way way * way * ** way ** more powerful than any other 3rd level rogue ability . 
  thieves get to pick locks using a bonus action and can climb and jump better . 
  nearly entirely flavourful stuff with limited mechanical benefit . 
  assassins get a couple of flavourful tool proficiencies and advantage on attacks only during the first round of combat , and only if they are higher than them in the initiative order . 
  proficiency with longbows is cool and fits the theme .
