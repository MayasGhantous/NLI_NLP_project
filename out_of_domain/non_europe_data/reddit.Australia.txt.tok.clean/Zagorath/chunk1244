  the static extra damage bonus is kinda unidiomatic to 5e , especially considering it scales with number of dice , but is probably not * too * game breaking in terms of balance . 
  still , even those two pieces on their own are enough for a sufficiently powerful 3rd level rogue ability . 
  i only skimmed the other abilities , but honestly they look pretty good to me . 
  i have n't spent an awful lot of time trying to think of how they could go wrong , or read in great detail what precisely they do , but they * seem * pretty good . 
  so it 's really only the 3rd level stuff that needs retuning . 
  the problem is that even if you remove zero target * entirely * , it 's sitting on the slightly stronger side . 
  not * too * strong , mind you , but closer to too strong than too weak . 
  with zero target , even if it was nerfed way back , this becomes absolutely too strong . 
  if you want to keep zero target , i would highly suggest getting rid of the +1 / d6 in trained accuracy . 
  both of those together is too much . 
  if you * do * keep zero target instead of trained accuracy , i ca n't comment on whether the specific changes would be sufficient to make it a worthwhile ability or not without seeing it . 
  trading off damage for versatility compared to assassinate sounds like a good place to start , though . 
  regarding flair , you had it flaired as `` class '' , not subclass . 
  our automod tries to take a guess at what to flair something based on the title , so when you 've included the word `` class '' there , despite it actually being a subclass , that 's what it 's going to get flaired . 
  you must always check to see if the automod 's automatic flair is correct , and override it manually if not . 
  french is * also * a romantic language though . 
  not consciously . 
  the main conscious inspirations were middle-earth ( the art style on the quasi-hand-drawn one ) and faer\u00fbn ( some of the place naming conventions ) . 
  it 's certainly possible that there was some unconscious transferal going on though . 
  i read all the books as a kid . 
  no , not a coincidence at all . 
  a lot of the names in my setting come from real words in other languages , or real words that have been twisted slightly . 
  unfortunately i did n't keep good notes on the origins of each of the names from a meta perspective , so i ca n't remember all of them , and the ones that have been changed slightly do n't show up in google translate . 
  only ones i can remember are kannas is finnish for isthmus , and i 'm pretty sure both vikuun and chivit are derived from some real world languages ' word for river or a synonym thereof , or possibly something like `` lifebringer '' . 
  so , for someone not familiar with the case , what is it ? 
  the artist of the second piece is suing eminem for copying their work ? 
  it 's obviously fake , but is it really so hard to believe someone * would * be filming this if it were real ? 
  just discretely filming what was going on already to send to mates as a laugh , or whatever ? 
  i would n't have pulled the coat off . 
  i 'd have tutted a little and shook my head , but otherwise ignored them and pretended it was n't happening . 
  i do n't know what it 's like at other colleges , but graduate students at international house do n't get meals most of the time . 
  i think they get a couple of free dinners per semester to use as they choose , but most of the time they have to cook for themselves . 
  yeah those all look like normal clapping to me . 
  you need to put a blank line in between each line for it to display correctly . 
  otherwise it becomes one big long run-on sentence . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  also when you do have a finalised version ready to submit to the subreddit , remember to flair it . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  as this is your second warning , any future unflaired submissions may be removed . 
  if you 're playing 5e , it 's called an opportunity attack , or oa . 
  you need to put a blank line in between each line for it to display correctly . 
  otherwise it becomes one big long run-on sentence . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  this subreddit requires only that you provide credit to the original artist . 
  this post is being removed because you did not add a flair to it . 
  you have been warned in the past that you are required to flair your posts on this subreddit . 
  normally i would say you are free to resubmit it if you are going to flair the post , but in this case it looks like your post is a * request * for content , which we do not allow anyway . 
  you should submit this instead to the arcana forge megathread . 
   you can really only get one attack with advantage because of being hidden as a ranged attack while hidden reveals your location no matter the outcome of the attack . 
  this is not correct . 
  you can continue to hide as long as you remain sufficiently obscured to your target . 
  as long as you 've got a wide tree , a corner , or some heavy foliage to hide behind/within , you can use the hide action each turn even after you make an attack . 
  this is both the as-written rules , and , as was explained on a recent episode of the official d&d podcast , is how it is intended to work . 
  brisbane has had 4 male lord mayors since 1985 , none of which has lived in california at any point in their life , let alone taken a second job there while in office . 
   just like you probably should n't use mindfuck ~ ~ for web development ~ ~, 
  this myth that millennials are bad with money is just that : a complete and utter myth . 
  [ here 's an article ] ( https://medium.com/the-mission/the-14-most-destructive-millennial-myths-debunked-by-data-aa00838eecd6 ) that addresses a number of closely related myths about millennials , including * directly * addressing the idea that millennials are financially illiterate as its last point . 
  also highly worth watching is [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hfwok9slqq ) aimed specifically at marketers aiming to market to millennials , but clearly made with the knowledge that a broader audience would be watching it . 
  the video debunks a number of other myths , and some that might be indirectly related to the idea that they are financially illiterate , about millennials , but it never directly addresses that issue specifically . 
  but i 'll address your specific point , regarding iphones and smashed avocado , and how it relates to car or home ownership . 
  let 's say someone buys themselves a $ 10 ( that 's the figure someone in the comments on this thread used , i dunno if it 's accurate ) smashed avocado sandwich once * every week * for * 10 years * . 
  let 's also say they buy a $ 1,100 iphone every two years for the same period . 
  that will cost them a grand total of $ 10,700 . 
  sounds like a lot , until you realise that 's an entire * decade * , and it 's still not enough for even a cheap new car ( mazda 3 , the cheapest major car brand i could find , costs an average of [ over $ 22,000 ] ( http://www.fleetcare.com.au/news-info/fleet-beat-blog/february-2016/how-cost-competitive-are-cars-in-australia ) ) . 
  and it 's such a small figure that it would n't even put a * dent * in the price of a house . 
  yeah i 've had these exact problems with discord , but not skype . 
  not in a long time , anyway . 
  discord is a great group communication server for text stuff , but my experience with it for audio communication has been abysmal , such that i 've just entirely given up on it for that at this point . 
  for monsters , the vampire template in the monster manual is pretty good . 
  for pcs , the best way to go is to use [ this prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
  both death knights and liches have been submitted in a number of different formats on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  doing a search on that subreddit should turn up some useful stuff . 
  every time i 've used discord for audio , i 've had at least one person who is either unable to hear everyone else , or who ca n't be heard by anyone else . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  yeah it 's not required . 
  i just give people a friendly reminder whenever it looks like their story is in the style of a greentext , because often we get people who do n't know how to do it . 
  i 'd probably rate the shadow fey about a 5.0 on a corrected form of detect balance , a little on the weaker side , but perfectly acceptable . 
  they kinda feel like they do n't have any particular * thing * though . 
  most races or subraces have a * thing * that really strongly defines them . 
  dwarven toughness or having * two * +2 s , a free feat , breath weapon , a +2 and * two * +1 s , relentless endurance and savage attacks , just to name a few of them . 
  * chill touch * is not terrible , but not quite as interesting as some of those are . 
  wild fey are harder to rate . 
  they 're 3.5 plus whatever the invisibility is worth , and that 's hard to rate . 
  i 'm leaning towards calling that +2 , making it 5.5 . 
  but even that makes this option sound mechanically on the weaker side ( but definitely acceptable ) , which i do n't think is the case . 
  this is an incredibly powerful option . 
  not overpowered , i do n't think , but definitely with a strength belied by that score . 
  i really like it . 
  very interesting both in terms of providing a unique mechanic and an interesting flavour , while remaining pretty well balanced as a race option . 
  that photo though . 
  the dude 's stance with the bow makes me physically cringe . 
  ouch . 
  as a minor presentation issue , race names are * not * considered proper nouns , and are thusly not capitalised unless they start a sentence . 
  and the text in your second column on the first page is just a * little * too close to the photo . 
  it would benefit from moving down by just a couple of millimetres . 
   hidden step - advantage and sneak attack every round ?
