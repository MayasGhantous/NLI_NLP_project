  try once per short rest . 
   touch of the shadowfell - most cantrips granted by a race tend to be utility spells rather than direct damage . 
  high elves get their choice of * any * cantrip on the wizard list . 
  this includes damage spells . 
  humans also have the option of at least two different cantrip-granting feats , one of which * requires * that it do damage , the other which does not preclude the possibility . 
  sure , it 's not super common , but i definitely would not argue that it is something that should be avoided , by * any * stretch . 
  not sure where you 're getting the advantage on non-physical saves bit from . 
  i did n't see anything about that . 
  shadow fey is currently honestly kinda weak ( though not * overly * so ) , although you 're right about it lacking flavour . 
  wild fey is just about perfect imo . 
  storm king 's thunder takes place in late 1486/early 1487 dr , according to the novels taking place at the same time , such as the devil you know . 
  out of the abyss was earlier 1486 dr. 
  1487 dr , by the way , has the moniker `` year of the rune lords triumphant '' . 
  as others have said , definitely playable . 
  if you 're interested in feedback , here are my initial thoughts . 
  most of the piece , musically , i love . 
  the only musical feedback i would give is that the chord on the last beat of bar 17 feels like it 's setting up a modulation into another key , but then it resolves back to the same tonic as before . 
  it feels awkward and incomplete this way . 
  like you 're getting excited for something to come , but then it never does . 
  i 'd also suggest adding some dynamic markings . 
  your phrasing is lovely , and it 's a nice thing to see , but dynamic markings are also crucial . 
  you 've got one at the very beginning , and then the same on again ( ? ), 
  at bar 5 , but no other dynamics throughout the piece . 
  generally , if you 've got a `` 1 . '', 
  repeat bar , it should be followed up by a `` 2 . '', 
  repeat line , just to make things super clear . 
  not a * huge * issue , but worth taking note of . 
  it 's just a little odd not to have , more than anything else . 
  i 'm not familiar with noteflight , but any notation software worth its salt should be able to have `` hidden '' objects , which are there for the purposes of playback , but * do n't * display visibly on the page . 
  use this to your advantage , and hide the pedal markings between bars 3 and 25 . 
  other than that , the only thing i can recommend is preventing objects from overlapping each other where possible . 
  the 8va line and the `` 1 . '', 
  repeat bar , for example , are overlapping where they do n't need to . 
  since you 've already gone to a third page anyway , no point squeezing everything in : give the music a bit more room and prevent those collisions . 
  but honestly , really lovely piece . 
  you 're definitely successful in your attempts to replicate the style of japanese video game music . 
  scores under 6 and above 21 , while rare , * are * possible , and this does n't take them into account . 
  that 's the only problem with it that i noticed that has n't already been pointed out . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  haha nah do n't worry about the image . 
  it 's not * bad * per se . 
  it 's just that his form with the bow is really bad and irl would at best result in bad aim/less power , and at worst hurt his back . 
  it 's probably not even that much worse than a lot of things seen elsewhere in fantasy artwork , it 's just that it stood out a lot to me . 
  for a piece of artwork in a homebrew document , it 's absolutely fine . 
  i 'm not sure that ` aoemaster ` , ` aoe2aoe2 ` , or ` aoeiii ` are necessarily dvorak-based passwords . 
  it seems more likely to me that they would be chosen because of the age of empires games ( of which 2 is ( unfortunately ) the most popular , and 3 is the most recent ) . 
  and ` [ ] ; ' , . / ` seems pretty explicitly a qwerty-based password , since it 's just running down the symbols on the right side of the main three rows of the keyboard . 
  on an unrelated note , this seems as good a place as any to remind people that if you are remembering your passwords , ** you are doing it wrong ** . 
  there is ** no ** good reason to not be using a password manager . 
  i recommend lastpass , because its architecture has been vetted by [ someone i trust ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9q_anb7pwg ) and because it 's available through a web browser on computers that you have n't explicitly set it up on ahead of time . 
  1password and keepass are other ones i 've heard good things about . 
  but the bottom line is you should be using one , and having it generate super-strong unmemorable passwords . 
  then you just need a single , properly secure , password to remember yourself . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  just that it 's aged * far * more poorly than age of mythology and aoe3 . 
  i 'm not going to argue against your general point , but this specific example seems absolutely perfectly consistent , to me . 
  recent graduate means someone who graduated fairly recently , it does n't necessarily mean they 're looking for someone * straight * out of uni . 
  they 're only looking for `` a couple of years experience '' . 
  now , i would say that two years of experience counts as a `` recent graduate '' . 
  again , the * general * argument you 're making is not one i want to refute . 
  just this specific instance . 
  haha the first one is absolutely unplayable these days , except for pure nostalgia purposes . 
  its netcode is so terrible i get crashes/desyncs basically every time i even try to play online . 
  not sure what you mean by `` the focus of the issue '' . 
  i just find it immensely annoying that aok is so much more popular than aom and aoe3 , despite being * so * inferior to both . 
  on which he has n't answered that question . 
  which puts us back at `` why does everyone think they know his principles ? '', 
   and ( < -- pretend that 's cursive ), 
  huh ? 
  what 's that meant to connote ? 
   when someone is shot or falls , they die like they do in the real world . 
  to that , i point you to [ this scene , in temple of doom ] ( https://youtu.be/sl1jwjummoo ) , which features not one but * two * falls that completely defy any sense of suspension of disbelief . 
  if you 're australian or british , you are incredibly lucky , because the abc and bbc are two of the best high quality , impartial news sources on the planet . 
  i 've vaguely heard good things about canada 's cbc as well , just not enough that i could put it in the above category . 
   the latest version actually deletes some codepoints, 
  wait what ? 
  source ? 
  i know unicode definitely has some problems ( the aforementioned lack of tengwar really irks me , and to a lesser extent the lack of support for other highly popular conlangs ) , but i was under the impression that lossless conversion from any system that they * do * support is their absolute number one goal , and removing * anything * would be massively counter to that purpose . 
  that 's an entire page of questions that went * unanswered * , except the last one , where he effectively said `` haha nope , not answering that '' . 
  proving my point . 
   unless it 's to lower expectations of salary, 
  exactly that . 
  it 's to get across that they want someone with * some * experience , but not * too much * . 
  it might please you to learn that [ unicodes current roadmap to the smp ] ( http://unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ ) includes a tentative spot for both cirth and tengwar between codepoints u +16000 and u +160 ff . 
  16000 -- 16fff has in general been reserved for `` recently-devised scripts '' , and tolkien 's scripts are alongside recently-devised scripts for the [ gurung languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gurung_language ) and [ moon type ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moon_type ) , an alternative to braille for reading by touch . 
  oddly , piqad/klingon does * not * seem to appear in the roadmap . 
  [ bing translate ] ( https://www.bing.com/translator/?from=tlh&amp;to=tlh-qaak&amp;text=nuqneh,%20tera%20font%20chenmoh%20jih ) can translate between klingon in the roman alphabet and piqad though , so there 's that . 
   judeo-arabic scripts ( hebrew characters with arabic diacriticals !, 
  could n't these be created without needing a specific unicode code point ? 
  while normally , arabic diacritics would ( i 'm assuming -- i do n't know how arabic is implemented in unicode ) be used in combination with another code from the arabic code block , is there any reason an implementation of the unicode spec could n't also support hebrew characters joined to arabic diacritics , possibly by making use of the zero-width joiner to make it explicitly clear that they should be joined ? 
  probably gets used less than tengwar , which despite being proposed back in 1997 is only just now on the * roadmap * to being included at some nebulous future date , or piqad ( klingon ) , which was proposed but * rejected * back in 2001 . 
  wait , is piqad meant to be `` picard '' ? 
  holy shit how did i just now realise this, 
  although that said , piqad is n't in unicode either . 
  hahahah i did n't even realise that 's what i was doing there . 
  brilliant .
