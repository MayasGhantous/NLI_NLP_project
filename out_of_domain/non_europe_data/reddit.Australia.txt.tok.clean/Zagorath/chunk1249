  i 'm sure i remember it being just the length of the episode divided by the amount of time we had to wait for it , last time i looked ( which was a * long * time ago ) . 
  not in 5e , anyway , no . 
  it 's by far my least favourite class . 
  the 4e bard was fantastic . 
  has it always been that way ? 
  two fucking episodes . 
  there were just two fucking episodes left . 
  they seriously could n't have waited two weeks before cancelling it !, 
  according to the wiki , the video game young justice legacy starts on 16/02/2015 . 
  it has nightwing and tim drake already by that point , so we know jason has to have started earlier than that . 
  for reference , the last episode of season 1 mostly take place 31/12/2010 , and season 2 starts 01/01/2016 . 
  sorry i ca n't narrow it down any more than that . 
  i find it 's usually best to lay some foundation before the rouge , with finer touches like shadow coming afterwards . 
  i think part of the problem there is that the show needs a relatable ongoing villain race . 
  someone humanoid with a big threatening nation/empire that can butt heads with the federation \\* . 
  with the klingon firmly entrenched as good guys by the time of the next generation they can no longer really fill that role , and the various other races that they 've * tried * to introduce as antagonists ( e.g. 
  the ferengi ) just have n't * stuck * in the way they need to to be the villains . 
  ( edit ) \\* butt heads both militarily and diplomatically . 
  that 's why they have to be relatable and humanoid . 
  the audience ca n't connect with weird monstrous races or races like the borg in a diplomatic sense . 
  `` pushing '' is n't working against gravity . 
  just because the motion your body makes is the same , does n't mean the physics is anywhere near similar . 
  it 's a good system , but not perfect . 
  the fact that the lower house is n't proportional is a huge problem . 
  but stv is vastly preferable to party-list mmp like new zealand uses , in my opinion , because that gives to much direct power to the party . 
  stv and irv essentially do not recognise parties at all , as constructs in the voting system . 
  what i would consider ideal is increasing the size of the house of representatives ( we have three times the population we did in 1949 , but only two times the number of mps , the ratio is even worse if you consider all the way back to 1901 ) , switching it to an stv system through the same process as described in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) ( essentially , merge multiple electorates into individual ones that elect multiple mps each ) . 
  then i 'm not entirely sure what to do with the senate . 
  dissolving it is an absolutely * terrible * idea , as any queenslander could tell you , but using the same electoral system seems like a flawed approach , too . 
  the problem is that i 'm not aware of how you could do a fully proportional system _ without _ using parties . 
  so i 'd probably leave the senate as it is , except to increase it to keep the `` as near as practicable half the number of members of the hor '' mandate . 
  alternatively , removing the state aspect of it and making it a nation-wide vote could also work . 
  i dare n't imagine what that ballot paper would look like , though . 
  despite the current system 's flaws , i do think it 's the best system currently in use in any part of the world that i 'm aware of . 
  presidents with de facto or de jure power are a ** huge ** mistake , so any system using those is right out . 
  i really do not like officially directly voting for parties -- although that 's really just a personal preference -- so that rules out a lot of other countries . 
  and of course , everyone can agree that any country that uses fptp in any form is just fucked up . 
  as far as i know , that rules out basically everyone else . 
   australia is the only [ anglophonic ] country to utilise preferential voting in both its single member ( irv ) and multi member ( stv ) forms, 
  does n't ireland use irv for presidential elections and stv for parliamentary ones ? 
  i might be remembering wrong . 
  edit : i will say , i 've been softened regarding my opinion on party list systems over time . 
  i wrote the above much more hardline against them than i actually feel these days on the matter . 
  in my setting , monks can be from anywhere . 
  their flavour is definitely kinda reminiscent of the stereotypical eastern monk , in that they 're introspective , they focus qi within themselves , from which they draw their power , etc. 
  but they do n't live in some far off country . 
  instead , monk temples are scattered all over the place and the people interested in harnessing their inner energy gravitate towards those in the way someone interested in magic might gravitate towards a wizarding school \\* . 
  they rarely mix with outsiders and mostly prefer to keep to themselves , but at the same time it would n't be super unusual for someone to leave the temple either temporarily or permanently . 
  and , much like with wizards , there may be some people who choose to dedicate themselves to this specialisation outside of the structure of the temple/school . 
  that said , if someone wanted to use the monk class and have it be flavoured in a completely different way , i would be totally okay with that , and might even build a larger order/civilisation around what they want . 
  \\* except that they would n't do that in the main civilisation of my setting & mdash ; my `` sword coast '' equivalent & mdash ; because arcane magic is outlawed . 
  i merely put that there for the sake of reference . 
  iroh 's more of a soldier or noble background imo . 
  ( also he 's only in gaol for a few weeks from the end of season 2 until the day of black sun . ), 
  i should probably say that the main reason i propose increasing it is just because stv works better in electorates with larger numbers of representatives , and if we * do n't * increase the total size , you 'll either be forced to make a couple of electorates with just two or three members , or combine heavily rural electorates like kennedy with urban ones like dawson , which is ludicrous . 
  increasing the total number of electorates before doing the merging process means we can keep the size somewhat more reasonable . 
  i was only using the comparison of population to mps as a kind of `` this is why doing that * anyway * is n't such a bad idea '' . 
  we unfortunately do n't have precise dates , but we do know that each season of the show lines up roughly with a season in terms of weather . 
  that means the time between the end of season 2 and the middle of season 3 is roughly half a season , or about 6 weeks , if we assume their year is the same as ours . 
  no one in real life could get as fit as iroh does in that time , but the show makes it quite clear that in the avatar universe physical fitness is much easier to achieve than in real life , and they 're all clearly capable of physical feats that would be impossible in reality . 
  i feel quite comfortable in justifying iroh 's quick transformation in the same way . 
  edit : either way , definitely not 10 years , which was the main point i was making in the previous comment . 
  this is n't a matter of opinion , the fact that ricky muir turned out to be pretty okay was entirely down to luck . 
  the way the preferences flowed with the gvts at the 2013 election bore no resemblance to the way voters would have wanted them to go based on similarity in ideology . 
  ricky muir got preference flows from parties as varied as the sex party and family first , no carbon tax climate sceptics and stop csg , the shooters and fishers and the animal justice party . 
  * clearly * , these preferences were * not * based in ideological similarity . 
  basically nobody even had any idea what his policies * were * , except i guess `` yay cars !, 
  '' , so it also clearly could n't have been the result of informed voters making a particular decision . 
  it was an absolutely fascinating showcase of the features of our particular implementation of the single transferable vote process , but by * no * means could it * ever * be considered the result of a deliberate design decision . 
  [ antony green has an incredible write-up on the process that saw muir get elected ] ( http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2014/08/ricky-muirs-strange-path-to-the-senate.html ) , which is well worth the read . 
   the problem is that people are lazy , so with checked exceptions many ( bad or stressed ) programmers will just use an empty catch block, 
  like , completely empty ? 
  people actually do this ? 
  not even , like , a ` system.err.println ( e ) ` ? 
  fighters are the specialist experts in wielding weapons . 
  you say the monks are specialist unarmed fighters , well , the fighter class is that , but armed . 
   the most mechanically braindead class in the game, 
  til `` barbarian '' is code for `` fighter '' . 
   sure , your spell list is terrible and restrictive, 
  honestly , my biggest problem with the bard is that the spell list is n't restrictive * enough * . 
  i really like the class in theory , but magical secrets absolutely just does not belong with it , and a heap of the spells on its spell list do n't either . 
  bardic inspiration is much better than * guidance * because it can be used as a bonus action ( it also scales to d8 pretty quickly making it way more better than * guidance * again ) . 
  you can also use it either on attack rolls of your allies , or negatively on enemies ' , depending on your subclass , which * guidance * ca n't do . 
  so ... why were you torn , exactly ? 
  everything you wrote there makes it sound like you love the scout rogue . 
  as a side note , you 're still missing one of two things that i associate with my two preferred versions of ranger . 
  either i 'm looking to recreate a d\u00fanedain ranger \u00e0 la aragorn , in which case you need a * little * low-key magic , especially as it relates to healing through poultices , or i want to be more of an ithilien ranger , \u00e0 la faramir , in which case i want to be using a longbow , and i also want the * option * of using heavy armour in circumstances where i know stealth is n't an option . 
  of course , both of these are readily achievable with the help of some other option . 
  the healer feat can be reflavoured without too much effort into the use of a herb similar to athelas , or you can get longbow proficiency and heavy armour access by taking your first level in fighter before going the rest of the way rogue ( or maybe up to 3 fighter for that extended crit range which is * so * good for a rogue ) . 
  out of curiosity , what 's the crop factor on your body ? 
  i ask , because i have a 200 mm lens and my camera has a 1.5 x cf , so the result is 300 mm full frame equivalent . 
  it 's certainly an awesome lens , but i 've found it 's mediocre at best for creeper-style photos . 
  i feel like i 'd want at * least * 400 mm equivalent , preferably more like 500 mm , for that sort of thing . 
   federal party requirements are currently far more lax than their state counterparts . 
  in a nation-wide stv ballot , that would n't matter . 
  or rather , it would , but not enough to save the ballot from being absolutely stupid . 
  instead of electing 6 ( or 12 ) senators , you 'd be electing 38 ( or ** 76 !! ** ) . 
  even conservatively , that 's gon na result in something like 60 candidates from the major senate parties * alone * in a standard senate election . 
  so that 's a 450 mm equivalent , yeah ? 
  looks pretty damn stunning .
