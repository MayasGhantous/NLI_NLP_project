  honestly , from such a small-time company i expect better . 
  it may seem counterintuitive , but my experience has been small companies tend to be better at cross-platform support than large corporations , and any company not doing this drops way down in my eyes . 
  not gon na be using this , and not going to even be recommending it to others ( including those who use windows exclusively ) just because of this . 
  ( also annoyed by [ their use of mac instead of mac ] ( http://www.mediamonkey.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=56 ) , which are two completely different and unrelated things . ), 
  ( it 's apparently been around since at least 2004 , which really just makes this even worse , it 's not like they have n't had time ... ), 
  sorry about that , was n't meant to be aimed at you or anything , just annoyed that something came so close . 
  i guess i should be glad it does n't seem to actually do exactly what i want out of a media library , or i 'd be even more livid . 
  honestly , i want the ability to add and search all possible relevant metadata for all different types of music . 
  search for `` concerto '' and it turns up every concerto , search for `` f major '' and ever piece marked as being in that key turns up . 
  same with composer , orchestra , conductor , soloist , time signature , film ( for film music ) , band , band leader ( particularly for big-band type stuff ) . 
  it 's a huge thing to ask ( because it 's so damn specific ) and i realise it 'll probably never exist unless i make it myself , but if you had a coupla drop down menus after you went to edit the metadata ( first the broadest type : classical , film , pop , whatever ; then more specific ones , for example for classical it might be symphony , concerto , string quartet ; then after that a series of metadata fields relevant to whatever you 've chosen : a concerto might have instrument , soloist , conductor , orchestra , is : full piece ( as a boolean field ) , movement number ( greyed out if is : full piece is true ) , opus number , et cetera et cetera et cetera ) . 
  as i said , i never expect to find this ideal piece of software , not to mention how much bloody time it would take to organise all your music in it , but anything approaching this ( as mm takes a small step in the right direction ) is definitely good . 
   the general `` song '' based approach to music players is very bad for classical music lovers, 
  this , to me , is the fundamental problem with itunes and virtually every other media library software ( of which spotify could probably be considered one , in a way ) out there today . 
  breaking down all metadata to `` song title '' `` artist '' `` album artist '' ( can anyone even tell me how this is used in pop music ... ? ), 
  and `` composer '' ( a field largely ignored anyway , at least in itunes , you ca n't even search for it ) just does n't work for anything outside of the most mainstream genres of music . 
  classical , soundtrack , world , even to an extent jazz all fail to be adequately served by the current paradigm of song and album used by these programmes . 
  someone else suggested clementine , which is across all three platforms ( with a whole bunch of versions specifically tailored for various flavours of linux ) . 
  it definitely looks really cool . 
  and no problem with the windows thing , i do actually use both , it 's just that i have a windows desktop and mac laptop , i just prefer to keep my music on the latter so i can listen when i 'm away from home . 
  honestly , i think he may have misinterpreted kingofthevale 's comment . 
  he probably means he broke up with them , and * then * completely stopped talking . 
  of course , he could just be a douche . 
  never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity ( but do n't rule out malice ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ feed ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ troll ), 
  honestly i do n't think it 's fair to assume he 's a douche without further evidence . 
  that said , i wrote that comment before reading [ this one by him ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/15dd4k/are_you_the_crazy_ex_i_want_to_hear_your_stories/c7lh36s?context=3 ) , which would seem to imply malice . 
   person ends a speech - claps, 
  pretty sure that one 's worldwide . 
   someone gets introduced - claps, 
  if you mean they get introduced right before making a speech , then same as above . 
  if you mean introduced to a group of people ( e.g. 
  at a party ) , then this one 's as stupid as all the others ( and they are truly stupid if they 're true ) . 
  bet there was n't much clapping at the end ( unless it was because that was the end ) . 
  nah , i was even younger and i really enjoyed it when i first saw it . 
  because of that , i still do n't * hate * it . 
  really ? 
  it has good ( i.e. , either built in , or custom fields that , once created , it remembers and can easily sort by ) fields for composer , orchestra , conductor , label , opus number , or any other reasonable fields relating to classical music ? 
  ( sure , asking for opus number and label are a bit finicky , but certainly the previous ones are not . ), 
  this always makes me go wtf . 
  where i am , seasons start on the first of the month ; not near the end of it , when the weather typical of that season is already long in effect . 
  as i write this it is christmas day everywhere on utc +8 or greater ( this includes all of australia , as well as nz , korea , japan , malaysia , singapore , and many other east asian areas ) , but at the time you did ( i 'm just gon na go ahead and assume it 's exactly 2 hours ago ) , this was only true of utc +10 or greater , which means east-coast australia and new zealand , as well as a few pacific islands . 
  jesus did actually live , and was a real person ( this is somewhat debated , but is largely accepted by most historians ) . 
  that said , it 's highly unlikely he was born today , and more likely somewhere around may -- june ( iirc ) . 
  scotland takes that as a compliment !, 
  i ca n't stand dim lights during the day , but at night i 'm happy to go with just the light of my screen and the backlight of my keyboard . 
  during the day i want it absolutely as bright as i can get it , and preferably an even white colour . 
  a light that 's too warm is really annoying ( and far too commonplace ) . 
  why the :(, 
  do you not like the dollar and two dollar coins ? 
  coos i fuckin ' love 'em , and think america is crazy for not having them ( yeah i know they do , and they never became popular , but that 's kinda my point -- also side note , lacking dollar coins is nowhere near as bad as that they still use bloody 1 cent coins ) . 
  because that date fits nicely with previously existing pagan holidays , making the transition easier . 
  and i 'll take the second one , no it 's not just christians , it 's the majority of all historians . 
  i 've brought it up in / r/atheism and / r/trueatheism a few times , and in the former i 've received a mixture of responses seemingly at random . 
  i first found this out in an episode of [ crash course ] ( http://youtube.com/crashcourse ) world history , but you can probably also find evidence in heaps of other places . 
  everyone else is talking about the luhn algorithm , but i ca n't get over how few tabs you have open !, 
  and also the g + notifications . 
  do you use it ? 
  some dude who claimed to be a profit or something . 
  i 'm not sure on the details . 
  miracles ? 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure those never happened . 
  just some dude with a small following ( christianity was never popular until a coupla hundred years after he died ) who claimed some stuff , like i said i 'm not sure about the details . 
  it 'll probably be in either [ this video ] ( http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=tg55erfdaey ) or [ this one ] ( http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=3pszvwznwva ) ( sorry of mobile links ) . 
  yeah , absolutely . 
  i 'm fairly sure the specifics of it are all made up . 
  the only thing i know is true is that he was alive , and he is the figure that was later used by john the baptist as the founding of christianity . 
  all the actual things he did are more than likely bullshit , as as you say are very similar to a variety of earlier religious beliefs . 
  are you a potato ? 
  but yeah , i know they 're arbitrary , but to me putting it right near the end of the month on the equinox ( which in a way could be considered the height of the season ) is just bizarre . 
  not that it really matters , there 's no real significance to when we decide to label the seasons . 
  no minimum bid . 
  this would defeat the point of the auction mode ( i.e. , all property must sell ) . 
  this is a common house rule that honestly serves no fictional purpose other than extending the game a little . 
  it 's not as bad as the alterations to free parking that some people use , but it does needlessly extend the game . 
  i ** love ** the very first chapter . 
  that whole thing about the singing and it creating is brilliant . 
  ( then again , i 'm a music geek . ), 
  personally i like to spend my holidays as a bridge . 
  smart families celebrate christmas a week later . 
  buy all the stuff in the post-chrissy sales !, 
  look i agree to an extent , but after a certain point you have to recognise when you 're never going to get an answer out of them . 
  morgan takes this way too far and it gets to the point where he does n't ever allow his guest a chance to speak . 
  i thought he was great the first time i saw him for exactly this reason , but when you get to see a few of his interviews you realise he makes a terrible interviewer . 
  checking in : we do n't want him either . 
  what would happen if both countries independently stripped the holder of dual-nationailities of their particular nationality without consulting with each other , in a short space of time ? 
  edit : made more hypothetical and generalised . 
  you you could change voting systems to add preferences . 
  no problem . 
  in australia , and i think the uk ( as well as many other places , probably ) you do n't vote with a tick on a piece of paper . 
  you order the candidates preferentially 1 -- x. 
  say your favourite candidate is the greens , followed by democrats , you would write 1 next to greens and 2 next to democrats , leaving libertarians and republicans blank . 
  then , when they count them up they first count all the 1 votes , and if no candidate has more than 50 % of the total vote they count the 2 votes ( and then the three votes if there is still not a majority , et cetera ) . 
  this means you * can * safely vote third party without compromising the chances of the major party you least disagree with winning . 
  [ cgpgrey ] ( http://youtube.com/cgpgrey ) explains this much better in one of his animal kingdom politics videos , but i ca n't link it now because i 'm on mobile . 
  edit : that tick on a piece of paper thing was meant kinda metaphorically . 
  so , what 's french punctuation ? 
  it 's hard for me to adequately compare since we do n't have a president . 
  our pm is elected by the house of representatives , and so we vote for our local rep and since our politicians ' party loyalties are much stronger than yours -- e.g. , our labor politicians will almost always vote for the chosen labor leader , they do n't vote against the party as they do in america -- this means the party with the most seats chooses the pm . 
  however , in our last federal election there was one green elected to the reps and i think three independents .
