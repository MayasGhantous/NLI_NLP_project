   i am ... requesting something to be ... tracked down, 
  this is also against the rules for submissions here . 
  if you want , you can ask either on dndhomebrew or on our [ arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 69xyku/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
   they were n't flimsy like a bo staff, 
  you say that like bo staves are flimsy . 
  they 're essentially the same thing . 
  through tradition , they were * used * in slightly different ways , but the weapons themselves are just a long stick of wood . 
  wikipedia says bo staves averaged about 3 cm in the middle , tapering to 2 cm at the ends , and [ images seem to validate that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c5%8d#/media/file:various_antique_japanese_bo_ ( staff \\ ) _ showing_the _ ( kontei \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  a quick google is telling me the most common diameter of a quarterstaff is between 1 and 1.25 inches , which is between 2.5 and 3 cm , about the same as the bo staff . 
  although i did find one guy talking about his 2.5 inch quarterstaff , which is a whopping 6 cm ( i 'm a little sceptical about how usable that would be , though ) . 
  as for woods , i 'm not sure . 
  hickory and oak come up a lot for quarterstaves , though some note that it 's not historically accurate . 
  ash and spruce have also been mentioned a few times as the more historically accurate woods . 
  regardless of the specific wood , it seems that quarterstaves are generally made of hardwood . 
  the wikipedia page for bo says `` the * b\u014d * is usually made with hard wood or a flexible wood , such as red or white oak , although bamboo and pine wood have been used , more common still is rattan wood for its flexibility . '', 
  make of that what you will . 
   nerds do n't really care about download speeds, 
  uhh , if i ca n't stream an hd video while also browsing the web , or it takes me three days to download a game , yeah , i care about download speed . 
  once a character is down , they have no reason to keep attacking them , if their main goal is for their side to win the fight . 
  once they 're down , they 're not a threat , and it 's a far better use of resources to try to take out the remaining threats . 
  the exception comes if their goal is different . 
  if it 's a pack of hungry wolves , one might be happy dragging away a dead body immediately to eat it , and not care what becomes of the others , for example . 
  is it al legal ? 
  no idea . 
  but if i had to guess , i 'd say no , because the al is ridiculously restrictive on both players and dms . 
  if you can get a proper game of d&d i 'd highly recommend it , rather than being stuck under the al thumb . 
  just a little tip on terminology , cli \u2282 ui . 
  gui is an interface that involves pointing and clicking with a mouse . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  hey , just a tip , this should have been flaired `` item '' , not `` resource '' . 
  resource is for resources designed to help others craft homebrew . 
  i 've reflaired it for you . 
  your link currently is not available to the public . 
  you have to change it so that `` anyone with the link can view '' from the google drive `` share '' menu . 
  because it 's been over an hour and you still have n't made it publicly available , i 'm removing this submission . 
  please do resubmit , once you 've fixed up your share link . 
  yeah , that counts as a request as well . 
  if you want to ask around for if someone else has come up with that , [ the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 69xyku/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) would be a good place to do that . 
  but we do n't allow requests , be they for new content or to find existing content , as submissions . 
  we have a compendium flair for such things . 
   classes only gain about 2 features per level , with the exception being paladins , who get 3 on level 2 , although their divine smite is essentially just another spell , so it 's not really a problem to add there . 
  even though this is a prestige class , you should follow the same pattern that the basic classes show, 
  this is mostly true , but prestige classes differ in one main way : they need to get across a very strong , very particular , flavour , at the same time . 
  for this reason , we can ignore class features that have minimal mechanical benefit , especially at level 1 , as far as determining those `` about 2 features per level '' . 
  martial arts , unarmoured defence , and wholeness of body are the only level 1 abilities that should actually be taken into account for this one . 
  which , obviously , is still too much ; but it 's not * quite * as bad as it might appear on first blush . 
  another thing that you kinda missed is that after about level 2 , most of the time if more than one new thing is gained , the second or subsequent thing will be a buff to a previously existing feature , rather than something completely new , or will be a relatively simple thing like a skill or item proficiency . 
  half-life definitely is not . 
  the sequel might be , but the original game has far too many mechanical flaws to be anything more than incredibly frustrating to someone not clouded by nostalgia . 
  and personally , i would argue age of empires 2 is vastly inferior to age of mythology , which is still pretty damn old , but is a * vast * technological and gameplay improvement . 
  things like the terrible pathfinding , lack of ability to queue unit building and upgrades , clunky grid-based buildings , and inability to rotate the map to see things that get stuck behind other things ( especially when gold is right behind trees ) . 
  it 's still * okay * , and it 's definitely playable , unlike age of empires 1 ( which , despite a * heavy * layer of nostalgia for me , i just find utterly unplayable today ) , but it 's not * good * . 
  i do n't know if i 'd call it an `` old '' game though . 
  personally i 'd reserve that for games from before 2005 or so , and warband came out in 2009 . 
  definitely still a great game though !, 
   age of empires ii , all day , every day, 
  units have abysmal pathfinding , you ca n't do something as simple as queue units and upgrades , buildings are forced to be built on an awkward grid-based system , and you ca n't rotate the map to see things that get stuck behind other things , like gold behind trees . 
  age of mythology fixes * all * of these shortcomings , to one degree or another , and is just all-around a much better game . 
  could not disagree more . 
  the shooter aspects of it are ... fine . 
  they were probably amazing in their day , but today it suffers from a lack of refinement compared to more recent games that built on its original mastery . 
  but an enormous part of the game is also platforming and puzzle solving . 
  and on these aspects , the game fails . 
  hard . 
  you run up to an edge and jump just before you reach it in half-life , and you fall , because apparently it does n't detect jumps properly or something . 
  moving boxes around is an awful experience , because they just randomly decide to jump halfway across the screen in response to a tiny sideways motion . 
  and do n't even get me started on ladders . 
  the lack of any real sense of narrative or purpose does n't really help , either . 
  [ you might enjoy this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuynhkal1i ) , essentially about what 's good about morrowind and why it 's superior to the two more recent games despite certain technological inferiorities . 
  i 'm also a programmer , so i might just be misremembering , but i 'm like 80 % sure i learnt the word grok way before i started programming . 
  confirmed that live stream of annihilation will be bringing a major brand new race or class !, 
  they would n't be deal breakers on their own , but when age of mythology exists and fixes all of them , i just ca n't see why anyone would play the worse game . 
  you can * see * them , but you ca n't reliably click on them . 
  it 's too easy to accidentally make your guys harvest wood instead of gather gold . 
  hi , this subreddit is for sharing d&d or roleplaying game-related stories .

  this submission is being removed . 
  to hide , you have to somewhere that you ca n't be seen , and then take the `` hide '' action . 
  being small makes the `` somewhere you ca n't be seen '' aspect easier , especially if you 're a lightfoot halfling . 
  but you still need to take the `` hide '' action , which represents not only making sure your body stays hidden behind whatever it is you 're hiding behind , but also represents being careful not to make enough sound for someone to locate you . 
  even being * invisible * does not preclude the need to take the `` hide '' action to be properly hidden . 
   initiative and turns are a way to bring order to a bunch of actions that in reality would be taking place somewhat simultaneously, 
  this is absolutely true , but as far as the mechanics of the game are concerned , you always need to pretend it * is n't * true . 
  always just pretend , for the sake of game mechanics , that the turns actually * are * happening one after the other .
