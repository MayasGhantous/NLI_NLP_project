  inkarnate used to be pretty good for this , but they 've since changed their art style so that they 're really only good for relatively small regional maps . 
  and they * are * very good for that , but at the cost of being kinda terrible now for world maps . 
  photoshop plus [ this tutorial ] ( https://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=8086 ) is what i used to make [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8as39us.jpg ) . 
  so you 're against minors , and you 're against an alternative to minors . 
  what , do you just not * want * any newbies being able to get a chance at competitive play ? 
  i understand the desire to compare it to rape , because it 's a fairly similar discussion with similar arguments on either side . 
  but it is * not * something that would ever be affected by what op is asking for . 
  you do n't sue a rapist , you press criminal charges . 
  it 's a criminal issue , not a civil one . 
  oh , right . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try asking at / r/dndmaps to share maps of your campaign world . 
   however , under certain circumstances , the dungeon master might allow you to stay hidden, 
  this part is the crucial bit . 
  you ** need ** to look at it not as if you 're able to do it , but sometimes a dm might decide you ca n't , but as if you are not allowed to do it except in specific rare circumstances where you * can * . 
  in combat , the default assumption is that everyone has their head on a swivel . 
  unless there is a particular reason that someone is intensely and exclusively focused on one thing , they will be looking around , and if they 're looking around , they 'll spot you once you step out . 
  so instead , your best option is to fire with a ranged weapon so you do n't reveal yourself until after the attack , or use a melee weapon directly around a corner , rather than needing to walk out . 
  i feel like these really need some flavour text . 
  i have literally no idea what any of these are . 
  it also has a number of mechanical problems . 
  * regeneration does n't say how you expend a point . 
  is it an action or a bonus action ? 
  * what 's russet mold ? 
  i 'm not aware of any such creature or effect for one to be immune to . 
  * a 50 foot movement speed is ridiculous , and it gets even worse in combination with bonus action dash . 
  * blurred run works under some extremely odd mechanics that do not jive well with the 5e system . 
  better would be to have it be one whole turn , once per short rest ( or maybe once per long rest ) . 
  * you ** never ** make rest durations different . 
  you can say they do n't need * sleep * , but that is not the same as shortening the duration of a long rest . 
  * spit fire does ... nothing ? 
  * alchemy blend does n't describe how to actually create this `` heat paste '' . 
  it only tells you the components required . 
  * damage immunity is completely unacceptable in a player race . 
  and that 's only looking at the problems with the design of specific individual abilities . 
  i have n't looked properly at the overall balance of the races , although i strongly get the impression that it is not good . 
   why are they not using any super powers ? 
  well it was all up on their spaceship in this episode , and i kinda figured that up there they were n't really exposed to earth 's sun very much if at all . 
  [ this was designed for games , but it 's equally applicable here . 
  all media is political . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryz_la3dn4c ), 
  i feel like lying about your entire * identity * would probably make your election unconstitutional too , so she 's probably already gone on that front . 
  i prefer the `` do n't go outside '' method of flu prevention . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  audiobooks are amazing !, 
  in general , i mean . 
  i do n't know if the tomorrow series is available on them , or what the quality of their narrator is if it is . 
  you get the * full * quality content that the original author intended , no bad acting , cheap effects , unnecessary extra action scenes , important narrative scenes cut . 
  none of that ; it 's the whole thing as the author wanted . 
  but it 's also `` without the reading '' . 
  i find it particularly useful because you can listen to an audiobook in times where you might otherwise be occupied . 
  cooking , cleaning , shopping , and commuting are the times i find i do the most listening . 
   it only applies to flights that transit or originate from certain airports and/or on some airlines, 
  for now . 
  there 's * already * talk in the us about extending it to flights from europe . 
  ( so this is n't a hypothetical `` slippery slope '' fallacy . ), 
  if it 's in three weeks , you 'll be fine . 
  they 're not going to get this past parliament that quickly . 
  obviously does n't help with the principle of the thing , but at least your one specific case in this instance should be fine . 
  yeah , c level executives might have their own planes , but the vast majority of people working at the company do n't ... 
   jetstar , the frugulist of airlines, 
  oh sweet summer child . 
  air asia does n't have any inflight entertainment for free , and you can pay to get given a tablet with some movies on it . 
  i do n't recommend it though , their selection is worse than crap . 
  also from what i 've heard , some of the budget airlines they 've got in the states are in a whole league of their own compared to what 's available here . 
  still , it 's definitely not even close to standard on non-budget airlines . 
  just for what it 's worth , that 's not such a fantastically high percentage of the country these days . 
  a lot more people emigrated to australia willingly than were sent over as convicts . 
  around 165,000 convicts were sent to australia , but the number of people who came over due to the gold rush was around 700,000 , not to mention any immigration since then . 
  they changed their system a while back to automatically add the slash to the end of every url . 
  turns out that fucked over my script with how it was parsing the results their api returns for the name of a subreddit , if that subreddit 's name ends in ` r ' . 
  anyway , should be fixed now , fingers crossed . 
  i did n't either until just now . 
  damn i 'm immensely surprised this is being downvoted . 
  it is so incredibly painfully true . 
  she 's a technically perfect pianist , but she has literally zero emotion or feeling in her performances . 
  might as well be listening to a midi playback when you listen to her . 
  edit : for context , when i made this comment , the above comment was sitting at like -3 , and that 's * after * i upvoted it . 
  wait , glitch was netflix ? 
  i saw it on iview . 
  indeed i do . 
  i 'll pm the link . 
  it 's precisely this that makes the catholic institution so fucking disgusting . 
  murder someone ? 
  rape kids ? 
  say sorry , and you 're totally fine . 
  but you say mean things about the magical sky f\u00e6rie and you are eternally damned . 
  there is nothing moral or good about that , and as far as i 'm concerned anyone who believes it is just is morally compromised . 
  the * character * hates republicans . 
  that much was already quite clear . 
  if you ca n't differentiate between the opinions expressed by a character in a show and the message of the show itself , that 's really quite worrying . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  that 's true , but it 's a complete cop out in a discussion if you ca n't justify why it 's acceptable . 
  [ here 's a link to that album which actually works ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbpy4yvhio ) . 
  i 've been finding [ battle roster ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.battlesloth.rosterfiveedemo&amp;hl=en ) a great android app for managing combats , including being an initiative , health , and status tracker . 
  it 's made by / u/loitering-inc .
