  it was more than a little clumsy when i first started using it , but after giving some feedback and the app receiving an update , it has become a really great fluid part of running combats . 
  is there a particular reason anyone * would * be interested ? 
  ( not an attack , i 'm just genuinely curious . ), 
  is n't amp meant to be all the same content , but served much , much faster ? 
   stats are : 10 str , 12 dex , 12 con , 10 int , 14 wis , 11 cha, 
  is that before or after racials ? 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  i started doing the research to make the same comment you did , but then got bored and decided against it . 
  glad someone went to the effort though . 
  for what it 's worth , even if you reduce the number to the ~ 58 % eligible of americans who * did * vote ( and wow , coming from a country with ~ 95 % turnout in all federal elections , that number just looks * abysmal * ) , a majority * still * did not vote in the only way that could have actually prevented a trump victory ( although a majority * did * vote `` against trump '' in the sense that their vote was for someone other than trump , this is not the same as using their vote to actually prevent trump getting in office ) . 
  clinton got just 48.2 % of the vote . 
  please tell me he at least had a proper d20 , and not one of those rubbish spindown things that most larger icosahedrons seem to be . 
  lindybeige has some directly d&d related videos . 
  but for the most part , they are , to be frank , utter shite . 
  nearly every other video he does is absolutely fantastic , but i think there 's only like ... one where he specifically talks about fantasy rpgs and d&d where he * did n't * make some enormous , largely false assumptions , and use those as a springboard to complain about shit . 
  in fact , i think lloyd 's most recent video is a great example of this . 
  his initiative video was nearly equally awful . 
  the one about the shape of dungeons and dungeon ceilings was good , though . 
  i find mercer 's tips videos honestly kinda awful . 
  not because they 're bad or meaningless advice -- the advice itself is generally good -- but because of the delivery . 
  he does it in this ridiculous over-the-top dramatic style that just does n't belong in an informational video . 
  i 'm sure it works great for dming , but a youtube tips video is not the place for it . 
  because i manually approved it . 
  yes , this is a repost . 
  it 's an annoyingly mistitled version of los tiburon . 
  you can see it in our [ hall of fame , here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  but it was last submitted over two years ago , and the subreddit has grown by more than 6 times since then . 
  if this post lets more people see it , that 's not such a bad thing . 
  it 's also a good opportunity to let people know about our [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , and suggest that everyone should take a look at it . 
  every story in there is worth looking at . 
  from the shorter stories section , i would particularly recommend the medusa , an evil necromancer in an online game , an evil campaign , gone ... good ? , and the drunken fighter . 
  from the longer stories , i would particularly recommend demigods and stranded . 
  both of these are ** really ** long ( longer than the other `` long '' stories ) , and i would recommend reading them like you would a book . 
  not all at once , but put it down after a while and come back to it a bit at a time . 
  they are * totally * worth it . 
  [ here actually are the search results for `` owe pan goggle a sister '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bnurqju.png ) . 
  or , alternatively , [ if you would rather the image results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehr3qqd.png ) . 
   but i know that will never happen because the people here are n't purists or even really interested in the actual quality of the content on the sub, 
  oh fuck off with this crap . 
  why are you even fucking here , if you hate the community so much ? 
  we are the ** only ** place on the internet that actually ** does ** give a crap about the quality of homebrew . 
  well , here and / r/boh5e , anyway . 
  dnwiki actively * revels * in low quality shit , and the dm 's guild has absolutely no method of curation and hides its feedback , resulting in a community that has little incentive to create better content . 
  banning all artwork is a fucking retarded idea . 
  like , the english language does n't have any way to express what a fucking terrible idea that would be . 
  art can only * possibly * be a good thing . 
  it increases the quality and usability of any homebrew that gets attached to it , without possibly having any negative impact on the mechanical balance . 
  i 'm not weighing in on the copyright aspect of it , because it 's quite clear that that 's not actually what your comment is directed at . 
  you 're using it as a launching point for your soapbox . 
  who the hell is this lord mesa everyone 's talking about ? 
  wrong mercenary named wilson . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   if you 've got to go back 2000 years to a time when it 's was n't a tradition , the religious types have a point, 
  i do n't think they do , because their argument is usually ( either explicitly or implicitly ) that it has * always * been this way , which is not correct . 
  the [ main list ] ( / r/listofsubreddits/wiki / listofsubreddits ) seems to be missing / r/dndnext , and the [ full categorised directory ] ( / r/listofsubreddits/wiki / newtoreddit ) is missing nearly all rpg-related content . 
  under `` board games '' you 've got / r/rpg , and under `` video games '' there are a couple of rpg-related things , including / r/rpg again . 
  ( as a side note , `` video games '' includes a whole * heap * of games that are n't video games , not just rpg stuff , but card games , war games , and traditional board games too . 
  i 'd suggest there should be a section for `` rpgs & war games '' at the same level as `` board games '' and `` video games '' , and it should include ( in just the order that i think of them ) :, 
  * / r/dndnext, 
  * / r/dndgreentext, 
  * / r/dungeonsanddragons, 
  * / r/dndhomebrew, 
  * / r/dndbehindthescreen, 
  * / r/pathfinder _ rpg, 
  * / r/lfg, 
  * / r/3d6, 
  * / r/rpg, 
  * / r/worldbuilding, 
  * all the subreddits from the `` rpg subreddits '' section of the sidebar on / r/rpg, 
  * most of the subreddits from the `` related subreddits '' section of the same . 
  hope that 's useful . 
  could you explain what you mean ? 
  nothing that i 'm seeing in this gif shows anyone & mdash ; either the cyclist or the motorcyclists & mdash ; riding irresponsibly at all . 
  the cyclist is down the far outside of the lane , as cyclists not in a bunch normally are , and nobody else is . 
  what the cyclist is doing here is completely normal and safe ... 
  where i live we also drive on the left , and overtaking on the left is [ very specifically not against the law ] ( https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/road/left/ ) . 
  in fact , cyclists are very specifically permitted to do exactly what this cyclist does . 
  as in , it 's an act that specifically gets called out as acceptable . 
  more to the point , though , i can see no good reason justifying any laws against this . 
  they 're all following the path of a road . 
  it would be dangerous for the cyclist to overtake on the * inside * , because that means crossing over from where they normally sit . 
  for a cyclist , passing on the outside is a perfectly normal and natural thing to do , regardless of whether the vehicle being passed is a motorcycle or a car . 
  it 's the cyclist 's responsibility to make sure the other vehicle is n't about to turn off , but that clearly was n't happening here , so there 's no problem . 
  yeah , different places have different laws . 
  in this case , where you live has dumb laws , because what this guy is doing is perfectly safe , assuming other people on the road have even the slightest modicum of common sense . 
  and making that assumption is * required * for * all * roads to be able to function , regardless of the types of vehicles using them . 
  you do n't swerve randomly across the road . 
  the cyclist could easily see the line the motorcyclist was taking , and knew it was perfectly safe to overtake , and then he did . 
  lane filtering ( * not * splitting ) was made legal where i live a couple of years ago , and it 's been nearly universally regarded as a positive change . 
  queensland , australia . 
  the sidebar gave me the impression that the categorised directory is aiming to include * all * subreddits , regardless of size ( or , to be more practical about it , at least as many active subreddits as possible ) . 
  is that not what it means when it says `` the directory is an ever-growing collection of every possible subreddit '' ? 
  anyway , on the video games page , [ there 's an entire section called `` tabletop '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/listofsubreddits/wiki/videogames#wiki_tabletop ) , which is entirely non video games that could be spun off either into the already-existing `` board games '' , or into a new `` rpg & war games '' category . 
   to reinvest back into the property that is dungeons and dragons, 
  hahahahahahahaha . 
  that optimism .
