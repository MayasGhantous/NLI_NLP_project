  as if hasbro would do something like that . 
  ( or even , for that matter , wotc corporate . ), 
  yeah sorry , i started talking about the main list ( when i suggested adding / r/dndnext ) and then switched to talking about the full directory . 
  sorry if i was n't entirely clear . 
   his contract stated that he was to be either the old mage or the lead female role, 
  so , he 's gon na be elminster in either case , then ? 
   if you have n't seen true blood or magic mike , you 've probably at least heard of those two things, 
  i 've heard of one of those two things , anyway . 
   the only thing that really stands out as not-super-generic to me is that the ranger 's a big spellcaster, 
  dragonborn and tieflings seem super-generic to you ? 
  and drow ? 
  i 'll agree with you that pretty much everything else is pretty generic , but those things stand out to me as * very * particular to d&d . 
  but yeah , a lot of d&d does feel very generic . 
  i think most of that is due to the seinfeld is not funny effect though . 
  i love how you started out with the assumption that * create bonfire * would be the better option , and then did the research to back up the claim , but then found out that actually oil is a way better option . 
  you 've got multiple rivers which seem to run from one ocean to another ... 
  clerics and druids `` know '' * all * the spells from their spell list , and can prepare from that . 
  wizards get a certain amount that they `` know '' for free , and can additionally add more to their spellbook during their travels , if they find scrolls or other wizards ' spellbooks . 
   the reason for it is largely balance , i think, 
  i doubt it . 
  why would it be ? 
  ranged weapons are already designed to be weaker than melee ones , on balance , to make up for the fact that they have the * advantage * of being able to be used at range . 
  it 's purely a flavour thing , and you described that flavour nicely . 
  should probably point out to them that it makes no sense . 
  it 's the perfect would for showcasing the superiority of [ dvorak ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/kb_united_states_dvorak.svg/1280px-kb_united_states_dvorak.svg.png ) !, 
  they mean `` not politically correct '' . 
  the more common term , these days , is `` flight attendant '' . 
   even if i change my own keyboards over to dvorak or something similar i 'm still stuck using qwerty on every other computer i use, 
  it takes all of 2 minutes to switch a computer from qwerty to dvorak , and most of that time is waiting for a slow computer to load the settings pages and respond to your clicks . 
  gendered terms in general are not politically correct . 
  actor is generally preferred for both men and women , yes , outside of award shows . 
  okay from that video , this looks fucking ** amazing ** . 
  and it 's cross-platform too !, 
  way too many of these types of applications are windows only , which as someone using macos and linux a substantial amount of the time , is a deal breaker . 
  the problem , though , is that i do n't play online , i play in person . 
  how would one go about using something like this in person ? 
  i 'm definitely not against the idea of using technology in some way for this , like connecting a computer up to a tv , but what sort of software would people recommend using to actually run the game in this way ? 
  edit : should say , i do n't want * anything * except the map and tokens digital . 
  no fancy features like automatic rolling , hiding stuff from players based on a dm 's account , etc. 
  just a map with tokens that can easily be added , removed , and moved around . 
  [ the end of all things ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mwxaaqoniw ) , from howard shore 's score to the lord of the rings , is absolutely perfect for this . 
  the scene it plays over has basically the same weight as what you 're describing : the desperate battle of the black gate , where the heroes know they stand no chance of winning . 
  the only difference is that in lotr , they 've got the trump card of frodo and sam being about to destroy the ring up their sleeves . 
  another great option might be rachmaninoff 's [ isle of the dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskcruy ) . 
  read this extract from [ the programme notes of one recording ] ( https://cso.org/uploadedfiles/1_tickets_and_events/program_notes/032510_programnotes_rachmaninov_isleofthedead.pdf ) :, 
   rachmaninov begins with the irregular movement of oars in the water . 
  the opening is dark -- just, 
  low strings , with timpani and harp at first -- and mysterious . 
  for a very long time , we move forward with, 
  little sense of destination , but with a growing urgency . 
  ( tantalizing melodic fragments appear from time to, 
  time , like glimpses through the mist , and a haunting high violin theme takes wing at one point . ), 
  finally , the, 
  island comes into sight , the music gathers force and direction , and at last we hear the dies irae , the, 
  gregorian chant from the mass for the dead . 
  then suddenly the music is suffused with life -- urgent , passionate , and joyous . 
  but the dies irae rings out , and the music is again, 
  clouded in shadows . 
  the ending is mostly still , and we are left where we began , with the sound of, 
  ceaseless rowing . 
  8 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jypqi5qp9ng ) might be another good choice . 
  each of its different movements carrying a different mood that might be appropriate , though i would particularly recommend the first , third , and fourth movements . 
  see the description for timecodes of each movement . 
  edit : one more . 
  [ the last agni kai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adal5g9xwn4 ) , from the avatar soundtrack . 
  it 's quite pensive , but with a strength and deliberateness behind it . 
  if you 're familiar with the show , you 'll know that the weight behind this music is again quite a good fit . 
  a victory , but a bittersweet one . 
  it 's * especially * odd , because this same notation is * usually * used as an alternative tremolo indicator on wind , string , and percussion instruments , especially if the notes are meant to be staccato . 
  three dots would indicate three articulations within the span of the note ( in this case , triplet crotchets ) . 
   emoji is a . jpg, 
  nope . 
  emoji is an informal name for a specific subset of the unicode specification . 
  i.e. , emoji are text characters . 
  fonts just usually render them in a way that looks like `` pictures '' . 
  the equipment * itself * is perfectly realistic . 
  they just use different words for it in the d&d universes than what we do . 
  anyway , 5e fixed the longsword/bastard sword problem , because they 're now the same thing . 
  roll20 can be used by a single computer to just run a map with tokens ? 
  no need for players to have a computer connected to anything ? 
  no need to worry about it getting in the way by enforcing movement speed limits ? 
  if so , i may have to give it a try , because that sounds pretty great !, 
   what laypeople say `` death metal '' , they mean metalcore or alt metal, 
  lay person here . 
  when i say death metal , i mean * anything * vaguely metal-like . 
  that search history tho ... 
   squirrels fornicating, 
   please help, 
  oh , i was mostly just saying that for the joke . 
  i actually do usually just say metal , on the rare occasions i 'm talking about it at all . 
  but still , i long ago learnt that it 's stupid to get upset when people refer to baroque or romantic music as `` classical '' , which i would argue is a much bigger error than getting confused between subgenres of metal , given how clear the lines between those are . 
  it 's just not worth it to get upset over most people not knowing the intricate details . 
   if you want to have christmas in summer and have it snow in june , sure . 
  australia here . 
  this is the correct and superior way to do things . 
  nothing better than a barbie on christmas or boxing day . 
  yeah exactly . 
  both dd-mm-yyyy and yyyy-mm-dd are fine . 
  but , as is usual , the system americans use defies all sense of logic or reason . 
  get a better app .
