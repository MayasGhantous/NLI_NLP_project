  i 'm flairing it for you this time , but any half-decent app , or even the web interface , is capable of flairing a post . 
  and literally * any * app should be capable of adding a comment . 
  an app incapable of that should n't even qualify as a reddit app . 
  i recommend reddit is fun if you 're an android user , and i 'm pretty sure the official app for ios is at least passable . 
  i 've seen some people do it backwards ( :, 
  that always looked wrong to me , but it usually stops the automatic emoticon/emoji conversion , and still keeps the correct proportions . 
   sorry , but you need adobe flash player to play haxball, 
  guess not , then . 
  both soccer and gridiron are played on foot , as opposed to on horseback , and both use a ball . 
  sounds like they 're both football , to me . 
   when you have a shape that 's not a ball, 
  okay google , define ball, 
   a solid or hollow spherical or egg-shaped object that is kicked , thrown , or hit in a game . 
  hmm . 
  sounds like the americans are right on this one . 
   and hold in it your hands, 
  i wonder where the use of `` foot '' comes from in `` football '' ? 
   although the accepted etymology of the word football , or `` foot ball '' , originated in reference to the action of a foot kicking a ball , this may be a false etymology . 
  an alternative explanation has it that the word originally referred to a variety of games in medieval europe , which were played on foot . 
  these sports were usually played by peasants , as opposed to the horse-riding sports more often enjoyed by aristocrats . 
  in some cases , the word has been applied to games which involved carrying a ball and specifically banned kicking . 
  for example , the english writer william hone , writing in 1825 or 1826 , quotes the social commentator sir frederick morton eden , regarding a game -- which hone refers to as `` foot-ball '' -- played in the parish of scone , perthshire :, 
    the game was this : he who at any time got the ball into his hands , run [ sic ] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part ; and then , if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him , he run on ; if not , he threw the ball from him , unless it was wrested from him by the other party , but no person was allowed to kick it . 
  damn . 
  looks like they 're right again . 
  as rare as that may be , they ca n't be faulted for this one . 
  sorry mate . 
  sorry , but this post is being removed . 
  unsolicited advertising is not permitted . 
  looking at your profile history , you also seem to be violating the 1 in 10 rule , which states that good reddit users make at most roughly 1 in 10 of their submissions promoting something they have created . 
  i 've been playing over 3 years and have * never * been banned . 
  it 's not exactly hard . 
  just do n't be a dick . 
  i ca n't really understand how people can repeatedly get bans . 
  edit : in the private message we received which prompted this post , tms shared [ this link ] ( https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use ) . 
  we really should have publicised it from the start . 
  it 's an essay on copyright and fair use from the office of the general counsel at harvard university . 
  it provides a perhaps much more authoritative source for the argument tms lays out . 
  ctrl/cmd-f `` transform '' to find the relevant sections . 
  while we do not and will never * require * all artwork is explicitly allowed for reuse , we do encourage users to obtain the rights where possible . 
  this includes public domain and creative commons artwork . 
  to that end , [ our resources page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/wiki/resources ) has been updated with a number of links that can aid users in finding new artwork under permissive licenses like creative commons . 
  check it out if you want to spice up your creations with artwork you have explicit permission to use !, 
  when i 'm creating stuff , i try to use that if i can . 
  after i 've exhausted that , i try to turn to things like screencaps from movies , artwork from big corporations like wotc , etc. 
  : stuff where my use is never going to have any even theoretical impact on some small-time independent artist . 
  i only turn to smaller stuff if i really ca n't find anything good otherwise . 
  as a side note , it 's important to note that ** this is all specifically us law ** . 
  that 's what 's most important in this case , because reddit is a us-based site . 
  other countries do not share the incredibly powerful fair use laws america does . 
  specifically , both the uk and australia have a law called `` fair dealing '' , which approximates fair use , but is much more limited to specific uses like critique , education , and satire . 
  under current australian law , the most common use of art on this subreddit , for creating homebrew , is * not * valid fair use . 
  however , [ australia is currently considering changing these laws ] ( https://www.efa.org.au/2013/06/11/fair-use-australia/ ) to a more us-like fair use system . 
  big corporations like film studios and media corporations are campaigning * heavily * against this . 
  ** the campaign ** *** for *** ** fair use in australia begins in earnest this coming monday ** . 
  view any wikipedia page from monday ( in australia ) , and there is a random chance you 'll be presented with a banner notifying you about this . 
  clicking it will take you to [ this landing page ] ( https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/fair_use_in_australia ) , which should hopefully , once live , contain more resources you can use to contact your mps and get involved in helping to improve the state of creators ' rights in our country . 
  ** please , all australians reading this , do get involved in this and send letters or phone calls to your mps , once the campaign begins on monday .

  reddit is fun . 
  i 've tried most of the others , including being in the beta for the official app . 
  they 're all terrible in comparison . 
  so are the shiftyjelly guys gon na lose their trademark on the name pocket casts between now and then ? 
   the entire work is being used , so the third factor is against, 
  not usually . 
  most good homebrews crop out substantial portions of the work they 're using , to get that tearing and watermarky effect . 
   an artist who is looking for work loses a potential sale when you use it , and a strong association between the work and your ua post could erode the artist 's ability to sell the work, 
  both of these arguments are highly speculative at best , and more likely just straight up wrong . 
  a homebrewer creating content to give away for free was ** never ** going to be paying for the art , so there can not possibly be any lost sales . 
  if the homebrewer was prevented from using one particular art piece for free , they would have turned to another one . 
  and the idea of a strong association forming between the secondary work and the primary one again is under the false assumption that people are going to form a strong association between * any * art that they see and any particular homebrew . 
  certainly this is not going to happen , at least not to any greater extent than simply the association of `` orc picture goes with orc statblock '' . 
   as a general rule , if you profit from something in any way , including exposure , then it will likely not be transformative . 
  here you are conflating two separate aspects of fair use . 
  whether or not the secondary creator * profits * from something is entirely * unrelated * to whether or not the work was transformative . 
  both are separate , independent , aspects of whether something may be considered fair use . 
   copyright and other ip regimes generally protect not only established monetization channels but potential ones, 
  this was their * intent * , but unfortunately more often than not these days , they * harm * potential new income channels , when they are strictly enforced . 
  patents are the worst for this , mainly because they are frequently given out for ideas that are * not * novel , but copyright also has this problem when it prevents someone from creating a new work based on a previous existing one . 
  if a court were to find a homebrew creator in violation , that would be a clear case of copyright doing more harm than good , but equally it can be a problem in , for example , cases of fans of a tv show making an unofficial continuation of it after it is cancelled . 
  a case where copyright law legally clearly * does * apply , but it is harmful rather than helpful . 
  as / u/the-magic-sword says , more recent court cases have been weighing the degree a work is transformative very highly , relative to the other aspects , and the us supreme court has stated that the more transformative the new work , the * less * will be the significance of other factors , like commercialism , that may weigh against a finding of fair use , while your claim seems to be that despite being * more * transformative in the case of using something that was not at first designed for an rpg , they would somehow weight the other aspects * more * , not less . 
  this appears counter to the claims of the supreme court . 
  anyway , while nobody here is properly qualified to give legal advice , i 'm certainly going to weigh the opinions of someone whose job does require an understanding of the fair use doctrine much more highly than some other rando , especially when that first person is using direct quotes from the ussc and from harvard council .

   the wumms feeling ( tm ), 
  awwww yeah . 
  i love that wumms feeling . 
  inb4 `` it 's labor 's fault for blocking our lord and savior 's plans to make gay marriage by having a national vote '', 
  i 'm still hoping for that wumms feeling \u2122, 
  and those who voted for labor , the greens , xenophon , and derryn hinch all were saying `` i empower you to make decisions on my behalf '' . 
  and they did . 
  by stopping the plebiscite from going ahead . 
  hells , even some of those the * liberal * voters empowered to make decisions recognised it as a bad idea . 
  dean smith , a liberal senator , also voted against it . 
  and since those made up a majority of the senate , surprise !,
