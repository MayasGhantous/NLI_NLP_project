  it did n't pass . 
  magic initiate works very nicely for this . 
  in fact it 's pretty much perfectly designed for this use case . 
  he 'll get one other cantrip , and a first level spell . 
  i might recommend * friends * and either * charm person * or * tasha 's hideous laughter * . 
  there might also be a useful feat from one of the unearthed arcana articles . 
  the menacing feat does n't quite do the same thing as vicious mockery , but might get the same general flavour . 
  / u/mrqueitsch is mistaken . 
  copyright is not entirely divorced from intellectual property ; rather , it is one specific type of ip , the main others being trademarks , patents , and trade secrets . 
  and our government is de facto encouraging the decline to worsen :(, 
  i 've always assumed rule 2 ( `` if you did not create the content , cite the source of it and give credit where it is due '' ) meant that if you use artwork , you need to provide credit to the artist . 
  that is correct . 
  it is a rule on this subreddit to provide credit whenever using someone else 's work . 
  that 's not a part of the law , just our rules . 
  and that is not going to change .

  could i make a small suggestion ? 
  your current css makes it look like everyone here is a moderator . 
  i actually thought you and / u/golddragon28 were both mods arguing back and forth over the rules of the sub . 
  only reason i noticed that * was n't * true was because i made a joke to that effect , and noticed that my own comment also had the green outline . 
  two minor off topic points that really have no bearing on this post :, 
  is n't it weird that we usually say `` french horn '' in english , but `` cor anglais '' ( english horn ) in french ? 
  the international horn society actually prefers you not call it a french horn , but merely `` horn '' , or `` horn in f '' if it is necessary to make it clear that it 's the brass instrument . 
  in fact , unless you 're in france or vienna , any hornist you see is most likely going to be playing a [ * german * horn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_horn ) . 
  hi , it looks like you are seeking help with a currently unfinished piece of homebrew . 
  please use the arcana forge thread at the top of the sub for questions of this nature , as the main subreddit is for fleshed out homebrew that is ready for critique and balancing . 
  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  my experience has been the exact opposite . 
  on the rare occasions i 've tried other servers , i 've found the players have no sense of sportsmanship . 
  indeed , the worst player on diameter as far as sportsmanship is concerned is a yank . 
  in that case , your options are :, 
  get a better app, 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair, 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  out of interest , what happens if you distinguish a comment further down the thread , like [ this one ] ( / r/askgamemasters/comments / 6cb6mw/my _ ranger_really_wants_vicious_mockery_without / dhtj8xn / ) ? 
  how odd . 
  i usually like rulings that mearls makes , but holy shit this is * terrible * . 
  it 's gon na slow down the game substantially , not just rerolling initiative every round , but using complicated rules that players are going to have to think about and work hard to figure out what to actually roll . 
  more often than not , they 'll be asking the dm what to roll , and in this case , i can hardly blame them . 
  plus , it removes the ability to think on your feet . 
  you planned on standing and attack the guy next to you , but he decides to run away on his turn instead ? 
  normally , you could choose , when your turn comes around , to chase after him . 
  with this , because you did n't declare upfront that you would be making a move , you are unable to actually use your movement . 
  also , literally none of your stats actually matter . 
  i do n't mind decoupling it from dex . 
  dexterity is already the \u00fcberstat , so weakening it is n't a problem . 
  i 've heard good arguments for both int and wis , and even proficiency . 
  but having your character 's stats all not matter for shit is kinda lame . 
  much less significant than the above two problems , though .

  i actually think this game mode is * better * than regular modes when playing with a weaker team . 
  i 've won two of the three 2v3 games i 've played where i 've been on the 2 team and both sides were earnestly trying to win . 
  yup , that seems to be the assumption . 
  it 's pretty terrible imo , but i figured people would like to know what he does . 
  i reckon you 'd struggle to get a cor anglais up there all the way to the bell . 
  i 'm wincing at just the thought of it . 
  the thing 's 90 cm long !, 
  also , does that mean a bonus action spell costs 1d12 +1 d8 ? 
  holy shit way to nerf the sorcerer even ** more ** . 
  plus another 1d12 on top of that if you 're gon na cast a cantrip with your regular action . 
  wow , dick move by the artist , in the best case . 
  worst case , i do n't actually think they 're even * allowed * to do that . 
  once they 've given you a licence to use it for a specific purpose ( `` licence '' , in this case , meaning `` expressly given permission in writing '' ) , i do n't think that they can revoke that licence for the same purpose . 
  * sigh * . 
  this again ? 
  the problem with this sentiment is that it assumes all strategic communication happening at the table in combat would also be happening in that moment in character . 
  but it would n't . 
  your characters are spending a lot more time with each other than actually gets roleplayed out , eating meals , travelling , resting , etc. , which frequently get skipped over in play . 
  what this means is that the characters are * necessarily * conversing about * something * with each other that the players are n't actually roleplaying explicitly . 
  and , because they 're adventuring together and facing a lot of combats together , some of that conversation is probably going to be discussing their abilities and possible strategies for using them in synergy . 
  when players talk strategy in combat , * this * is what 's coming to light . 
  the characters are n't * currently * discussing what they should do , they 're just playing out what they think would be best based on conversations that never explicitly happened at the table . 
  you 'll get a better response if you post this in [ the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 69xyku/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  this subreddit has never yet been made a publicly active one . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` monster '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey just so you know , i 've removed this post , since it 's a double-post . 
  the other copy ( submitted about 15 minutes earlier ) is still up , though . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   clashes with ua class features that grant bonuses to initiative, 
  and existing features that do this . 
  initiative is , after all , just a dexterity ability check , so * guidance * works on it , as do features like jack of all trades . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  hey thanks for the feedback .
