  simply laying out the facts for anyone to come to their own conclusion . 
  hmm . 
  i might have done something wrong , but after i sent the email the only thing i saw was the donation form . 
  no address or phone number details available . 
  since the basic template is ( a ) a little sparse , and ( b ) aimed more from the perspective of every-day activities and education , here 's the email i sent , from the perspective of a creator , aimed towards a liberal mp . 
   dear [ my ] mp ,, 
   i am writing to support fair copyright for australia and the introduction of a fair use exception , as recently recommended by the productivity commission . 
   as a content creator , the value of fair use is immense . 
  the current exemptions under our fair dealing laws are good , but they do not go nearly far enough in allowing australian artists of all media to build upon existing works and create new artistic expressions . 
  it has been noted that such works as andy warhol 's campbell 's soup cans would be illegal under current australian laws , and the infamous `` larrikin music publishing pty ltd v emi songs australia pty limited '' lawsuit ( over the use of a musical riff from `` kookaburra '' in the men at work song `` down under '' ) , which is clearly a case of a highly transformative and both culturally and economically beneficial use of an otherwise copyrighted work , and one which expands the greater australian cultural lexicon , would have ended very differently , if australia had adopted a saner , more creator-friendly approach to copyright , such as fair use would bring . 
   further , by not having fair use laws , australian content creators such as myself are left crippled on the global stage . 
  works that can be created and shared by creators in the united states are often in violation of copyright laws here in australia , stifling creativity which , for a content creator , is the same as hindering productivity . 
   since 1998 , six different government reports have recommended the introduction of fair use laws in australia , including the most recent productivity commission and 2014 's australian law reform commission . 
  it 's time the government acted on the advice of the reports it has commissioned , and put australia at the forefront of content creation laws on the global scale . 
   i believe that copyright should concentrate on what is fair for consumers and creators . 
  fair use would rebalance our copyright system to make it flexible and fair . 
  feel free to take any or all of that as you ( the general you ) wish . 
  you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
   wotc follows a core +1 philosophy, 
  that philosophy , as utterly terrible as it is , does n't really apply here . 
  that 's for * character building * , not rule selection . 
   there 's nothing you can do in combat to go first when going first is critical, 
  well , if you know there 's a combat coming up , there 's * guidance * , bardic inspiration , normal inspiration , and probably more . 
  but anyway , that 's by far the least significant problem with the system . 
  far more problematic is the way it would grind everything to a halt and prevent players from reacting to things as they happen . 
  you 're a guy with a sword , and the guy you wanted to attack gets a better initiative than you and steps one step back ? 
  well , because you did n't specify at the start that you were using your movement this time , you 're not allowed to follow . 
  you 're a wizard with the spell * misty step * prepared , because you know it 's not good if you get caught up in a melee . 
  you start your turn nice and safe , and choose to do nothing more than cast one spell . 
  but before your turn comes around , the big bad guy runs up and is standing next to you !, 
  normally , you could use a bonus action to * misty step * away , and then blast him with a * firebolt * . 
  this time , unfortunately , you did n't prepare a bonus action , so you ca n't get away . 
  or , alternatively , if the dm lets you cast it , since you * did * prepare * a * spell , then once you 're away , you can no longer cast your cantrip , completely defeating the entire purpose of bonus action spells . 
  this system * removes * your ability to * react * as combat is happening in a way that would be considered completely natural and logical otherwise . 
  very good point . 
  it was always intended to work with finesse . 
  i 'll find a way to write that it . 
  the 1 ft thing is borrowed from the implacable mark feature of the knight in [ unearthed arcana : fighter ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2016_fighter_ua_1205_1.pdf ) . 
  edit : that first part was * really * difficult to do . 
  after trying half a dozen different versions of it , i think i 've settled on a wording i like . 
  could you double check it for me ? 
  how do you reconcile this whole system with the fact that it means people are utterly unable to react to things going on ** right in front of them ** ? 
  unable to decide to chase after the guy that just stepped a single step backwards . 
  unable to cast * misty step * and use a cantrip to react to the enemy suddenly rushing toward you . 
  in fact , does n't it kind of make bonus action spells in general completely useless , since unless you 're specifically planning ahead to use them , you just ... ca n't ? 
  yeah , it 's pretty damn myopic in my opinion . 
  we 're designing a new game mechanic . 
  that * requires * some degree of theory crafting to do well . 
  it 's impossible to avoid and still come up with anything close to a good system . 
  this is incredibly important , and i would highly urge everyone to contact their mps by whatever means possible . 
  australia 's current fair dealing laws are * okay * , but they are seriously lacking behind those of the united states . 
  big media corporations are campaigning * heavily * against this , because while it [ is in the best interests of the community and economy at large ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_fair_use_proposals_in_australia#productivity_commission ) , it goes against their own interests . 
  we need to counter their media misinformation campaigns . 
  contact your mps , tell your friends to do the same , or at least help inform them about why this is important . 
  umm , is that your phone number ? 
  automoderator has automatically filtered out this comment ( nobody but mods and yourself will be able to see it , until a mod approves it ) , and i 'm not going to approve it until i know for sure that you really wanted to share that . 
  edit : now approved . 
  i 'm having trouble figuring out what to flair this as . 
  parts of it look like a paladin subclass , but other parts look like a full class . 
  which is it ? 
  whatever it is , you need to remember to flair your submissions yourself in the future . 
  hey , comparing netflix to uber is totally unfair . 
  uber is a shithole of a company that happens to provide a service that 's good . 
  they 're a seriously horrible company . 
  netflix has n't had anywhere * close * to the same amount of scandals uber has . 
  what difference do you see in a registrar doing it and a host doing it ? 
  if one registrar does , you can just go to another . 
  both are just companies that have the right to decide what they do and do not support . 
  it may not , unfortunately , have real legal weight , but australia * does * officially `` support '' the universal declaration of human rights , which includes `` right to freedom of opinion and expression '' . 
  i would take that ( well , really even without that , but it 's nice to have something concrete to point to ) to mean that , morally , ethically , and philosophically , we absolutely * do * have that right , and if our laws do n't reflect that right , they are faulty . 
  yup , that 's working . 
  i wish i had seen the advice before i sent the email though . 
  i did n't include a bit about a future letter coming . 
  ah well . 
  now to figure out how snail mail works !, 
  ( but that 's all on me . ), 
  does n't matter . 
  they agreed to let someone else use it , and then after that other person had started doing stuff that relied upon it , they pulled the rug out from under them . 
  it 's a dick move . 
  no two ways about it . 
  to / u/jyamira , in response to your deleted comment . 
  as far as i 'm aware , unless there were terms specifically stated in the licence to allow it to be revoked under certain conditions ( which , if said licence was simply a written `` you can use this in your rpg project '' , is unlikely ) , an express licence can not be revoked unilaterally . 
  i do have one question for anyone reading this . 
  currently , the buckler seems like a strictly worse version of the main-gauche , mechanically . 
  can anyone think of a good way to change this ? 
  current options i 'm considering :, 
  * allow +1 to ac on range attacks , instead of 0, 
  * a * feat * that allows the above , and maybe some small other bonus . 
  * a feat that allows the use of a reaction to gain a much more significant ac boost against a single attack , once per short rest . 
  i 'm open to feedback on any of those , as well as completely alternative options . 
   beethoven 's moonlight sonata first movement, 
  you talking about the bit right before the start of the recapitulation ? 
  absolutely love that moment .
