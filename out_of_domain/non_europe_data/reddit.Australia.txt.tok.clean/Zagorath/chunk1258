  edit : wait , never mind . 
  i thought you were talking about pedal points , not ostinati . 
  still , that moment is a fantastic pedal point . 
  the first movement of [ beethoven 's sonata no. 14 in c \u266f minor , `` moonlight '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80zmsda5q8q ) has a fantastic pedal point on the dominant , right before the recapitulation . 
  ( in less musical terms : right before it repeats the main theme from the beginning again , it holds on a note that really , really wants to resolve down to the main key , and then when it * does * resolve down , sounds incredibly satisfying . ), 
  the pedal point starts around timecode 1:22 in the linked video , and effectively lasts until the resolution at 2:03 . 
  the first movement of [ beethoven 's sonata no. 8 in c minor , `` path\u00e9tique '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcockyqx3c ) is famous for its loud , boisterous pedal point on tremolo cs . 
  starts right after the slow intro section , at 2:06 , but the same motif reoccurs throughout the movement . 
  [ hallelujah , from handel 's messiah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usfiaswr4qu ) contains a really nice pedal point on the tonic , carried by the timpani and low strings , for a few bars near the end . 
  timecodes 3:07 to about 3:27 in the video . 
  i do n't know which sources you 're speaking of , but the ones that i 've heard it from have all been very firmly left-wing ones . 
  it 's a regular topic on the technology podcasts i listen to , hosted by self-confessed `` bleeding heart liberal '' leo laporte . 
   theoretically , a round of combat is all happening simultaneously , so you really should n't be able to react to things other people are doing the way you normally can in d&d, 
  this is somewhat true , but also misleading . 
  yes , the current d&d system causes problems with verisimilitude . 
  but mearls ' proposed alternative is actually * worse * , because it goes much too far in the opposite direction . 
  you * would * be able to adapt to an enemy running away by deciding to follow after them . 
  that 's purely instinctual . 
  you probably would be able to cast an especially quick spell such as * misty step * , in response to an enemy unexpectedly getting close to you . 
  ( `` probably would '' only because it 's a spell and we do n't really know * exactly * how it works . 
  but i 'm pretty confident anyway , especially since it 's verbal only . ), 
  meanwhile , it still does n't solve the * real * problems with the turn based system . 
  problems that * no * turn-based system can * ever * solve , like all the problems that arise from the fact that one person 's turn is completely resolved before the next one goes . 
  e.g. , if i go first , i can get two enemies inside the radius of my * fireball * . 
  if one of them goes first , he gets to run his entire 30 & nbsp ; ft. distance before my * fireball * happens , so i only get one enemy . 
  if * both * of them go first , and run in the * same * direction , i can now hit * both * of them again . 
  this despite two guys starting from near the same place , ending in near the same place , and my attack aiming to hit both of them . 
  that 's really just * one * of many , * many * possible examples where suspension of disbelief is at the very least strained , and the only way to solve it is to completely and fundamentally overhaul the way the entire game functions . 
  and even then , i 'm doubtful that it can truly feel real . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  personally , i feel like riposte is pretty much equal with the swashbuckler 's master duelist . 
  both are a once-per-short-rest extra chance to attack an enemy , with advantage . 
  this one allows you to use a reaction when an enemy misses you , while md allows you to try again if you miss . 
  do you think that this is a significant step backwards ? 
  if so , could you explain your reasoning ? 
  flair is a system we use for categorising everything , to make it easier for people to see what it is they 're getting , and to make it easier to search for things . 
  a post can only have one flair , but we have a number of different ways you can add one . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  this is generally a very confusing option and it 's not designed in a way that makes it easy to figure out what is what . 
  try looking closely at the player 's handbook classes , and write yours up in exactly the same style and order as those do . 
  i 'm not going to go into too many specifics , because it 's just a very messed up and confusing post , there 's too much to even know where to really start . 
  however , i will point out just one thing . 
  the spell slots are all completely wrong . 
  classes should all be either full , half , or third casters . 
  this is none of those . 
  it 's completely unorthodox . 
  got ta put the message in square brackets for it to work . 
  also , because of the way it 's set up , it should be an instructions . 
  ` [ to vote in ... ] ` , etc. 
  that way , the bot ends up saying `` paging person1 , person2 , and person3 to vote in ... '' . 
  i just finished on the phone with google support . 
  it 's late at night where i am right now , so i got them to ring me back tomorrow . 
  the person i was initially with had reached the end of her list of troubleshooting options and apparently i 'm going to be escalated . 
  i 've done all the stuff you said you 've tried , plus a few other options . 
  she even got me to reset my whole device ( urgh ... wish i had n't done that ... got ta redo the last 6 months of getting my phone how i like it ) , all to no avail . 
  really bloody frustrated with the whole thing .

  whoa ... i do ** not ** recommend clicking on the links to this dude 's blog . 
  guy is full-on deluded . 
  i was not expecting that ... 
  haha yeah ... i learnt that just a couple of minutes ago ... 
  if you really want it , it 's right under the comic itself in the link above . 
  i 've never sought out these comics . 
  mostly only ever see them in this subreddit and similar contexts . 
  the first one is across five years . 
  the second and third ones just use some abstract concept of `` time '' . 
   all of a sudden the ` scientist ' has this shoehorned into his explanation : `` then we ignore the models that we do n't like . '', 
  he actually says `` ignore the ones that look wrong to us '' , which is actually true , albeit misrepresented . 
  they use dozens of models because they do n't know precisely how the climate functions , so they use a huge bunch of different possibilities . 
  they ignore the models that do n't match up with what the world has looked like so far , and thus must be wrong . 
  it has been noted by some that andy warhol 's campbell 's soup cans would probably be illegal under current australian laws . 
  additionally , it 's probably that with proper fair use , men at work would have * won * the lawsuit where they were sued for using a small extract of `` kookaburra '' in `` down under '' . 
  it 's that type of transformative use of copyrighted material that , in my opinion , is * especially * important . 
  it 's an approach that promotes the creation of new creative works , which is good both for the broader culture of the country , but also its economy . 
  [ this page here ] ( https://www.faircopyright.org.au/ ) has some sections for why various segments of the population would benefit from fair use . 
  specifically , it has a section for content creators , for educators , for the economy , and for the average person . 
  if that does n't convince you , perhaps the fact that six different independent reports since 1998 have each independently recommended that australia introduce fair use will . 
  hi , just so you are aware , we have a rule that if an updated version of something is submitted too soon after the previous version , you are required to delete the first version . 
  i 've taken care of it for you this time , but in the future remember to remove old posts . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` spell '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an * appropriate * flair to your submissions . 
  a note on that `` appropriate '' . 
  mystic disciplines are obviously new , and we do n't yet have a properly defined flair for where they should go . 
  for now , i 'm putting it in spell , because disciplines fulfil roughly the same niche for the mystic that spells do for casters . 
  had you used `` subclass '' , i probably would n't have been giving you warning , because i could see a case being made for that , too . 
  regardless , `` meta '' is clearly not the appropriate flair . 
   why does australia need fair use when the copyright act of 1968 already covers it with fair dealing ? 
  because fair dealing is far too limited in scope . 
  with fair dealing , only the things * specifically * called out by it are fair . 
  fair use is broader , and it instead lists certain specific fair uses only as examples of what could be considered fair . 
  because australian content creators are currently extremely limited in their ability to create new and transformative works , relative to creators overseas , as exemplified by men at work being sued over kookaburra . 
  fair dealing 's `` research and study '' criterion is actually * extremely * limited . 
  in * de garis v neville jeffress pidler pty ltd * , it was held that the exception, 
  only applies if the person who does the copying is the person who does the, 
  research or study .
