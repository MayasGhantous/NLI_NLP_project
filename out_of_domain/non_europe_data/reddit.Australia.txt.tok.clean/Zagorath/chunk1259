  in other words , a tutor can not legally copy material from a book and give it to students , because this is * not * covered under fair dealing in australia , by way of precedent . 
  ( schools , as educational * institutions * , are exempt . ), 
  disclaimer : not a lawyer . 
  this is my lay-understanding based on [ this report ] ( https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/13-educational-use/fair-dealing-education ) . 
  even if my understanding of the * reasons * that i have provided here is wrong , clearly those more educated than me believe fair use would be beneficial for educational use . 
  i think it hard to find a better , more authoritative source , than the australian law reform commission . 
  [ this vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) is by far the best option out there . 
  it 's created by one of the best 5e homebrewers , and has been reviewed and found to be one of the highest-quality homebrews made for the entire * edition * , let alone the best vampire option . 
  it provides all the vampire flavour you could possibly want . 
  you start out with the basic vampire stuff like weakness to sunlight and being undead , but as you level up in it ( meaning succumbing more to the vampirism or learning to control it more ) , you gain more and more powerful vampire features , like turning into mist , or gaining powerful mind-controlling effects . 
  a race is fundamentally unable to properly encompass vampirism . 
  either it 's way , * way * too powerful for a race , or it misses out on a huge part of the flavour . 
  vampires need weaknesses to light , water , religious symbols , etc. , and they need the blood drinking , the charming , the shapechanging . 
  simply too much for a race . 
  that 's why a scaling system like a prestige class works perfectly . 
  races also have the obvious downside that you have to * start * as a vampire , or otherwise you have to lose all your old race features when you become one , which does n't make a lot of sense most of the time . 
  if you really * do * want a race , i 'd recommend [ this one ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) . 
  vrylokas are n't * quite * the same thing as vampires , but they 're very , very close , and they work well as a race . 
  nicely balanced , get some of the vampire flavour without actually * being * vampires , since that 's too strong . 
  it 's also a far more compelling race to play than the zendikar vampires , which have a very ... * particular * flavour , and so do n't actually work well for most concepts of vampire . 
  they 're also of highly suspect balance . 
  being able to create unlimited zombies is ... not good design , especially when these zombies are apparently `` faster and stronger '' than normal ones . 
  with how crucial the action economy is in 5e , that 's dangerous . 
  two problems with this . 
  first , the pagelist is formatted incorrectly . 
  each person needs to be on a separate paragraph , not using a line break . 
  second , you got ta put the message in square brackets for it to work . 
  also , because of the way it 's set up , the command should be an instruction . 
  ` [ to vote in ... ] ` , ` [ for ... ] ` etc. 
  that way , the bot ends up saying `` paging person1 , person2 , and person3 to vote in ... '' . 
  your message would have said `` paging person1 , person2 , and person3 calling senators for maiden speeches . '', 
  which is n't really a proper sentence . 
  yeah i really wish the homebrewery had chosen it for the thumbnail . 
  it 's absolutely gorgeous . 
  i do n't necessarily know that it would be a new law , rather than an amendment to an existing one . 
  i do n't particularly care either way , it 's just a matter of semantics . 
  only thing that matters to me is whether or not we get the change made . 
   how do winged creatures move and deal with turns , going up and down , hovering , etc. 
  they deal with turns exactly the same as creatures on foot . 
  they just turn . 
  no need to deal with turn radii any more than there is on foot . 
  you can already turn on a dime if you want to on foot , there 's no reason flying should be any different . 
  they move up and down the same as they would forward and backwards . 
  just treat their 60 ft ( or whatever it is ) movement as if it were a full sphere , instead of just a flat circle . 
  unless something is binding their wings , they can hover ( as you 're probably thinking of it ) just fine . 
  bottom line is , do n't overthink this . 
  there 's nothing complicated or confusing about it . 
  you can make it even easier by making ** 0 ** on the ground , since d10s usually go 0-9 rather than 1-10 . 
  then you just say that they are at 5 ft. \u00d7 the die number above ground . 
   plenty of people are fine with the fact that none of that makes any sense whatsoever, 
  it makes exactly as much sense as the rules on the ground do . 
  yeah , i did . 
  glad to have helped . 
   if you 're just downloading content for personal use , you 're breaching copyright , but it 's a civil issue - ie the rights-holder can come after you for damages , but the police wo n't be chasing you, 
  out of interest , how does this apply to the use of bittorrent , where the user is both downloading * and re-uploading * the pirated content ? 
   does it really matter if basic things such as forwarding email , quoting and cloud storage are `` illegal '' if everybody does it and nobody enforces the law ? 
  yes , yes it does matter . 
  just because it is n't enforced , does n't mean it 's okay to just let it * stay * illegal , because that means that someone still * can * get in trouble for it , especially if they 're for whatever reason a target . 
  are you drunk or something ? 
  it 's not far from true to say that [ they * literally always do * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/us0ukkp.png ) . 
  i do n't think i 've * ever * seen a d10 with the value `` 10 '' on it , except the ones where they count in 10s ( 00 , 10 , 20 , 30 , etc. ) . 
  and even those , i do n't think i 've ever seen one that had 100 rather than 00 . 
   if anything it brings more free advertising when someone posts a little gif from a movie or tv show, 
  not only that , but it encourages the creation of * more stuff * . 
  more people can make more new things , which is great for the economy !, 
   the only effective solution to that is more timely , reasonably-priced access to quality content . 
  the only effective solution is more policing and suing all the people who do n't pay for my thing . 
  & mdash ; big corporate rights holders, 
  to the best of your current understanding , which political parties have the best stances on copyright and intellectual property laws ? 
  which have the worst ? 
  interested in both the major parties and smaller ones . 
  edit : damn , just noticed i missed out on the ama by 10 minutes :(, 
  i care about the change happening . 
  i do n't care whether it happens via a completely new law or an amendment to an existing one , if they end result is the same . 
   somewhere someone is going to make money, 
  outside of libraries and educational institutions , i believe that the biggest beneficiary of fair use is relatively small-time content creators . 
  youtubers , independent musicians , that sort of thing . 
  these sorts of people * will * be more able to make money from what they do thanks to fair use . 
  it 's less of an issue for bigger guys because the cost of licencing content is comparatively insignificant to them , and also because they 're comparatively hard to attack when they * do * violate copyright anyway . 
  hahahaha , that 's brilliant . 
  if you 're interested , i think the * reason * for it is that it makes rolling percentile dice easier . 
  in that case , you treat the 0 as a 0 , so unless you roll 00 on one and 0 on the other ( in which case it 's 100 ) , reading the numbers off is simply and intuitive . 
  it 's just simple inattentional blindness . 
  people have a tendency not to notice something if they are n't expecting it . 
  it 's natural to just expect the die to work the same way all others do , and there 's no special reason that one would be paying particular conscious attention to the values on a particular die , so it 's easy for your brain to just fill in the gaps . 
  ( which is , incidentally , the same as the reason for the berestein bears thing . 
  - stein is a common name suffix , so people naturally expect the name of a thing to be that , rather than - stain , which is not . ), 
  edit : cognitive dissonance or confabulation might have been the better psychological effects to reference , rather than inattentional blindness . 
  either way , it 's a very simple problem . 
   superman with all his experience should be stronger than supergirl, 
  it 's actually a pretty common part of the superman canon that supergirl is stronger than him . 
  in the air you can use your wings to achieve the same thing . 
  kinda like a canoeist pulling back with one oar while going forward with the other . 
  you 'd be better off replying to everyone else in this thread . 
  i 'm the one arguing in favour of allowing to do that . 
  although , to play devil 's advocate for a minute , it 's at least possible that the reason birds can do that has more to do with their small size and incredibly low mass . 
  low & nbsp ; mass & nbsp ; =  & nbsp ; low & nbsp ; momentum , and low & nbsp ; momentum & nbsp ; =  & nbsp ; acceleration & nbsp ; ( in & nbsp ; any & nbsp ; direction ) & nbsp ; is & nbsp ; easier . 
  yeah seriously . 
  one single exchange in this episode , plus one brief hint in an early season 1 episode . 
  that 's all they 've ever done .
