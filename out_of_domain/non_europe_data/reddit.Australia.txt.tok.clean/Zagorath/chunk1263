  healer , tank , social stuff , exploration stuff . 
  he had everything * except * dps . 
  it 's just a stupidly powerful class . 
  for me it 's the fact that each of these races have their own flavour , and i do n't want people ignoring that flavour by changing their stats around . 
  what 's the point of playing against type if your mechanics feel the same as if you were playing * on * type ? 
  aww , why 'd you delete it ? 
  it 's such a beautiful shitpost , and also a useful psa at the same time . 
  the great thing about 5e is that it 's designed to remove unnecessary nitpicky mechanics like that !, 
  the only thing that annoyed me was that there was no way to dismiss the notification without opening this tab . 
  why was there no `` x '' in the corner to just close the thing ? 
  that 's not a brady-ism , it 's a normal expression . 
  asking the important questions . 
  asmodeus , the king of the hells , is a god . 
  he ascended to godhood during the 3.5-4e gap , by devouring the divine spark within the former god azuth . 
  none of the other devils are also gods . 
  [ here 's a link to the actual ama ] ( / r/australia/comments / 6ct2w0/we _ are_from_wikipedia_the_ada_and_efa_australians / ) , since your link was to the earlier news thread . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try submitting to / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to share gaming advice . 
  in the episode you said you were convinced not to do it via wikia because it 's terrible . 
  i 'm curious why that is exactly . 
  does n't wikia also just use the mediawiki software that this one seems to be running on ? 
  i feel like 32 is too many to do in a single survivor game . 
  maybe if `` beethoven early sonatas '' separately from `` beethoven middle sonatas '' and `` beethoven late sonatas '' . 
  11 , 16 , and 5 , respectively . 
  even 16 's a pretty high amount to do in one game . 
  oooh yeah , that 's a good way to go about it . 
  you 'd have to use approval voting ( or , i guess , * dis * approval voting , in this case ) to get anything close to a fair result from it , but that 's not too hard to manage . 
  if you removed 5 in the first two rounds , 4 in rounds 3-4 , 3 in rounds 5-6 , 2 in rounds 7-8 , and then 1 at a time in the last four rounds , it 'd work pretty nicely . 
  on what grounds do you think it is unethical to sell someone something that they * need * for cheaper than they could get it otherwise ? 
  assuming , because we have no reason not to , that the quality of the service offered is equal . 
   they 're the starbucks of consumer goods, 
  except they 're actually succeeding , [ unlike starbucks ] ( http://www.sbs.com.au/news/thefeed/story/why-starbucks-just-cant-crack-australian-market ) . 
  the only difference between what you described and australian law is that instead of being `` 2 years warranty period '' ours is the `` expected life of the product '' . 
  we also do n't * technically * need the receipt , only `` proof of purchase '' . 
  granted , that usually means the receipt , but if you can prove you bought it through some other means , that 's legally acceptable . 
  well , when you 're from a town as small as bundy , it would n't be surprisingly at all to learn that they 're connected in * some * way . 
   like how people will spend $ 10 worth of petrol to save $ 5 on a product, 
  and yet * wo n't * spend $ 10 worth of petrol even to save $ 20 on something that costs a thousand or so all up . 
  if you know precisely what the shortest note value is , you can set it on the `` notation '' tab during import . 
  you can also adjust how it decides what to call a staccato note , what types of tuplets it allows , etc. 
  a pretty bad approximation , tbh . 
  that 's 33.33333 cm , near enough . 
  better approximation is to say a standard ruler ( 30 cm ) is one foot . 
  that 's only a couple of millimetres out . 
  i was bored while out running the other day , so i did some calculations in my head to work out how fast the * average * character goes in combat . 
  there are some loose approximations , because in-your-head calculations are wonky at the best of times , and i was having to convert between modern and archaic measuring systems ( i , too , am aussie ) , but i found the results really interesting . 
  turns out , when they dash , they go about the same speed in each round as i go for 10 km , and i 'm no kenenisa bekele !, 
  * i go about 5:00 / km . 
  * that 's 1/5 km ( 200 m ) per minute . 
  * divide that by 60 and you 've got 3.3333 metres per second . 
  * that 's nearly 20 metres in a six second round . 
  * with a foot being about 30 cm , 1 m is about 3.3333 m, 
  * so 20 m is a little over 65 ft. 
  an average d&d character can do 60 ft. in a round by dashing . 
  obviously anyone with * any * bonuses is going to be easily beating that . 
  cunning action , a 35 ' base speed , a monk 's bonus , etc. 
  but still , in my head , 60 ' per second was sprinting , and i was basing a lot of the flavour in my head on that , so i was quite astonished to find out that it 's the pace of a fairly relaxed jog ( for a good but not excellent runner ) . 
  so , weirdly enough , would / r/auslaw . 
   as everyone knows , chrome 's home page/new tab is not good, 
  news to me . 
  it 's the only one i 've ever used . 
  it has my most visited sites on it , and a search box . 
  nothing more i could want . 
  this is why i recommend lastpass . 
  it 's completely cross-platform ( browser plug ins for all major browsers , as well as both ios and android apps ) , and even has a web interface ( all the crypto is done client-side ) for when you 're using devices you ca n't install the app on . 
  some other password managers , i think , have a usb-run client , which can allow you to also run on a majority of computers that you ca n't properly * install * software on , although this will fail on very highly locked-down computers . 
  the xkcd comic , in this case , is actually really * not * good advice . 
  and it 's even less good advice today than it was when it came out , since hackers will literally put * any * technique they hear about into their dictionaries , and you can * bet * they 've now heard of randall 's technique . 
  the fact is , things that are memorable are not , by their very nature , high-entropy . 
  a bunch of dictionary words might look high entropy if you take it from a simple `` each letter has this much chance to randomly appear '' standpoint , but combinations of letters which occur in a simple english dictionary are * not * random . 
  they 're very well known . 
  and hackers have the entire dictionary , as well as a huge number of possible different arrangements of the dictionary ( including 1337 speek , sticking multiple words together , common misspellings , dates , simple patterns on the keyboard , and any permutation of the aforementioned methods ) in their hacking dictionaries , because it costs them * nothing * to put those in . 
  there are less than 5000 common words in english . 
  that 's less than 10 ^ 15 permutations . 
  sounds like a lot , until you realise that an attack can easily be 100 billion attempts per second , which takes you down to just 10 thousand seconds to crack . 
  under 3 hours . 
  and that 's still not solving the problem of different passwords per site . 
  using this system , most people are going to end up doing the same thing they do today : have one or two different passwords that they use around the web . 
  i know he was very well-intentioned , but monroe probably did more harm than good with his correct horse battery staple comic . 
  with a password vault , you can easily create a 20 + character fully pseudo-random password . 
  with just 20 characters , a fully pseudo-random attack will take even a much faster attacker than the one listed above , one attacking at one hundred * trillion * guesses per second , over 11 thousand trillion centuries to exhaustively attack . 
  and it costs * you * zero effort . 
  and it 's unique per site , so you do n't have to worry about one site leaking leading to you being vulnerable elsewhere , even if that site 's security is low ( plain text and/or unsalted hashes ) . 
  all you have to do is remember one single password , which can be much stronger , since you do n't have to worry about remembering multiple of them . 
  it 's obviously never a good idea to give out one 's own password technique online , but something that mixes munroe 's technique with the first letters of a common phrase , and includes some numbers and symbols in there , can * easily * reach 20 , 25 , or more characters while being trivial to remember . 
  is password vaults * did n't * exist , munroe 's method would be pretty good . 
  nobody should ever follow the precise advice given by anyone else , of course , but taking munroe 's system and adding a little twist or two ( make it five words , capitalise one random letter , change one random letter to a number , etc. ), 
  would be pretty good . 
  but considering just * how much * better a password vault is , and how it 's actually * easier * , it 's a no-brainer . 
  my reaction , upon seeing 2 , was an incredibly shocked and disappointed `` oh my goodness '' . 
  it 's terrible . 
  never do that . 
  youtube used to not display ads on mobile , i 'm pretty sure it 's a legacy feature from back then . 
  the second one looks bad because the notes should clearly be beamed , and they are n't . 
  i think in vocal music that sort of thing might be common ( not entirely sure , vocalists are weird ) , but if you can beam your quavers and it 's not going across a major beat , do it . 
  having the slur on the opposite side of the staff to the tie , and the b facing upward next to all the other down-facing stems also looks wrong , and that 's true regardless of whether it 's instrumental or vocal . 
   rangers do n't come with a component pouch, 
  you know , out of ** all ** the casters in the * entire game * that * should * come with a component pouch , rangers are at the tip-top of the list . 
  most wizards , sorcerers , and warlocks etc. 
  archetypally use an arcane focus .
