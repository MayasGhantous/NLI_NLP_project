  clerics and paladins use a holy symbol . 
  even bards have their musical instruments . 
  but rangers ? 
  they use the plants and other stuff around them . 
  * of course * they should have a component pouch . 
  it 's ridiculous that they do n't . 
   on pg . 
  202 , it says you ca n't cast more than 1 non-cantrip spell in a turn, 
  no , it says, 
   ### bonus action, 
  a spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift . 
  ... you ca n't cast another spell during the same turn , except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action . 
  in other words , if you cast a spell with a casting time of bonus action , ** then ** and * only * then , can you not cast another spell unless it is a 1 action cantrip . 
  paladins are also half casters , but get a holy symbol at level 1 . 
  what do the other players at the table think ? 
  if the dm is doing this because he 's afraid you 're overshadowing the other players ( which is , imo , the only reasonable reason to nerf a player 's features from the phb ) , then perhaps having them point out that they 're * not * feeling overshadowed by it would help swap him . 
  i was always under the impression that the ` a ' on the keyboard was derived because the other ` a ' , which is pretty much the only one seen in handwriting , does n't display very well on screen , and thus apart from a few specific fonts , the open ` a ' is nearly always used . 
  mearls and crawford have been quite clear on this . 
  action surge to cast two spells is perfectly acceptable . 
  but if you use a bonus action to cast a spell , you * can not * , regardless of whatever other options you make use of , cast a non-cantrip spell . 
  just a small bit of nitpicking , because i just love muphry 's law so much , the style for spells is sentence case italics . 
  capitalise only if they 're a proper noun like * leomund 's tiny hut * , but not if they 're just a word , like * fireball * . 
  that 's what the italics are for . 
  it makes it clear that these are a specific game mechanic . 
  ( i just wish wotc had gone with capitalisation for certain other game mechanics , like race and class names . 
  since those have ** no ** way of being identified as such . ), 
  the dm 's guild is , for a bunch of reasons , not a very good source . 
  there 's some good stuff there , but you really have to work to find it . 
  the best place to go is / r/boh5e . 
  it 's a highly curated subreddit so literally everything on there is top notch . 
  a lot of good stuff on / r/unearthedarcana as well , but on there you 've got ta be careful to filter out the bad . 
  upvote counts help a little , but mostly you really need to look at the comments and see, 
  1 . is the feedback generally fairly positive ,, 
  2 . is the creator giving the sense that they understand the rules and know precisely why what they made is balanced , and, 
  3 . is the creator responding to criticism and , where necessary , making the appropriate updates to their content . 
  not on the keyboard itself . 
  when you type with one . 
  i ca n't disagree with that . 
  i just find it exceedingly inconsistent to be okay with a laptop , but then suddenly be of the opinion that a phone is off-limits . 
  especially with all the useful apps out there for both dms ( initiative trackers , especially ) and players ( spells being the most important bit ) . 
  i got [ crazy good at ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0amor ) trex , the little dinosaur game in chrome , back when i first moved in to my current apartment and was waiting to get internet access . 
  that , and my old favourite rts games : age of mythology , age of empires 3 , and battle for middle earth 2 . 
  samsung is well-known to be involved in astroturfing , so they doubtless have some people paid to be posting pro-samsung opinions in threads like this one . 
  they also have an apple-like cult following of people who , without being paid to be shills , are genuinely unable to recognise how terrible it is . 
  what ? 
  yeah when i 'm playing a piece with large amounts of rest in it , i almost never actually count the whole thing . 
  i just learn a specific notable point a few bars before my entrance and count from there . 
  `` oh , the trumpet comes in at bar 14 of the last block of rests '' , `` oh , the main theme comes back in the violins 4 bars before i enter '' , that kind of thing . 
  the fact that i 'm pretty sure mr goats here is mostly just bitter about having their submission rejected ( unfortunately , looking through both our modmails and our submissions spreadsheet , i can find no record of anything they 've submitted , so i can not , unfortunately , comment on either the truth of their statements or the reason they were rejected ) notwithstanding , they * do * have one valid point . 
  we ** are ** worse than would be ideal at communicating with the people who submit things to us . 
  unfortunately , we receive quite a lot of submissions , and we 're a very small team that 's nonetheless dedicated to the highest possible quality of review . 
  that means we by necessity can only review a small fraction of what gets submitted . 
  but we also get enough content that * is n't * rejected outright that we ca n't reply to people and say `` sorry , this is rejected for x , y , z reasons '' . 
  instead , they end up in a big queue which , unfortunately , never may actually get posted . 
  if something has obvious formatting , balance , or language problems , it 'll get rejected outright . 
  if it seems , on the surface , good , but has a flavour none of our critics are interested in , it 'll end up languishing in our queue , because with the ratio of submissions received to accepted , we can afford to be kinda picky . 
  it might see the light of day eventually . 
  it might get silently rejected because it 's been sitting there so long it 's clear it wo n't get published . 
  we really do regret that , but with a team the size we have , and the high bar we 've set ourselves for quality ( of both reviewed content and the reviews themselves ) , that 's our only option . 
   other than the mystic , i am still having trouble understanding how they will actually play, 
  personally , i thought it would be fine , so i allowed a player at my table to play one . 
  but i would no longer recommend it . 
  it 's a crazy powerful and highly flexible option . 
  it became a running joke at our table ' `` do you think tim can do [ fairly outrageous thing ] ? '', 
  `` oh , i 'm sure he can , he just needs to spend one or two psi points . '' ', 
  he could move at a speed way faster than a monk , heal very comfortable amounts and even heal our undead character ( something a cleric can not do ) . 
  he tanks damage like a fucking * boss * -- only barbs and druids are better . 
  he can completely * destroy * any social interaction . 
  and his pool of points is large enough that he does n't have to worry very much about spending too many points while doing all this . 
  i love psionics and i really wish it was well-implemented in this edition , but unfortunately as it is currently , it 's kinda game-wrecking . 
  you would n't ask a film critic to concentrate * only * on the dialogue of a film to the exclusion of the cinematography , acting , etc. 
  you 're not surprised when a literary critic does n't ignore bad writing because the story is good . 
  it 's fairly well-known that food critics are going to comment on the presentation of the dish , especially in high-end establishments . 
  why would you expect a place whose aim is to review the very ** best ** of homebrew to not also care about presentation ? 
  when you delete all your submissions , it 's pretty damn hard for anyone to give you proper feedback . 
  in your history , i could only find two things . 
  one of which was deleted , and i only found it thanks to the mod comment reminding you to flair your post . 
  the other received generally positive , albeit not very in-depth , feedback . 
  hard to take your complaints seriously when that 's the evidence i 'm seeing . 
  but anyway , i 'm not sure how you can possible say a subreddit where chains of comments like [ this one ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/boh5e/comments/5rqrxw/rule_of_law_by_uirishbandit/de7fl60/ ) or [ this one ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/boh5e/comments/4utkc6/the_dark_arts_players_companion_by_ujonoman3000/d6jip7l/ ) are common gives `` weak , limited feedback '' . 
  if you 're concerned about your submission not being accepted , see [ my comment further down the thread ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 6dpgkn/is _ it_annoying_to_always_use_homebrew_material_as / di4zqde / ) . 
  but put simply , a post may not be accepted for any number of reasons , and if it does n't get submitted , it does n't get reviewed . 
  talking about most standard serif or sans-serif fonts . 
  not artsy ones like those emulating hand writing , comic writing , etc. 
  hey now , wsl makes windows an actually worthwhile platform now !, 
  i 've often thought i should write a bot that corrects `` i.e. '', 
  vs `` e.g. '', 
  vs `` aka '' . 
  people get those mixed up so often . 
  ninja edit :, 
  oh , and, 
   should of vs should have, 
  this one actually already exists . 
  / u/shouldhavebot, 
  [ a better dictionary ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/whoa ) lists it as an alternative spelling . 
  not the * best * way to spell it , but not entirely wrong , either . 
  i would have thought that , once , but i also thought colonial era empires would n't work very well , and yet aoe3 is fantastic . 
  i would have trusted the dev team from old es to do it well . 
  it 's actually kinda hilarious how unplayable aoe 1 is today . 
  i would ** love ** to see it get remade within a more modern engine .
