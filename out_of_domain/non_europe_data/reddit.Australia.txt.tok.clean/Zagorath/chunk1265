  hells , even just the old bang !, 
  engine from aom and aoe3 would be great for a remade aoe , although an even more updated one would be nice . 
  i 'd love for them to make an age of mythology 2 and an age of empires 4 as well , with the latter continuing their trend of moving forward through history . 
  something that spans from the late colonial period , through the scramble for africa , and up until the first world war . 
  sadly , the whole rts genre has essentially died out . 
  highly competitive gamers these days get their kicks from more fast-twitch , narrow focused , less strategic games like mobas . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  there just is n't the market for good , big budget rts games . 
   year of the dragon, 
  ah yes , the last spyro game . 
  it 's such an incredibly shame they never made another game . 
  i loved that franchise as a kid so much . 
  gateway to glimmer was the only one i owned myself , but i rented ( remember dvd rental stores ) year of the dragon , and a friend owned spyro the dragon . 
  every one of them is amazing . 
  is that what that was called i loved that game !, 
  never knew the name of it because my copy was in korean . 
  i think i only managed to explore about half the variety of the game because i could n't understand most of the menus and such . 
  but still , battling friends in that was awesome !, 
  i really wish they 'd go back and pick up the story again , following something more along the lines of their initial intentions , as if ac3 and beyond just never happened . 
  i did n't , but i just read the wikipedia plot summary . 
  what 's so bad about it , exactly ? 
  eso is great , but it 's not a main series game , so arguably does n't fully count . 
  hahahaha oh gods that was brilliant . 
  best thing i 've heard all day . 
  they would absolutely hate the books and tabletop game that baldur 's gate is based upon , then . 
  google 's ngrams , which tracks usage in publications , [ paints a very different story ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=whoa%2cwoah&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3b%2cwhoa%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bwhoa%3b%2cc0%3b%3bwhoa%3b%2cc0%3b%3bwhoa%3b%2cc0%3b.t4%3b%2cwoah%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bwoah%3b%2cc0%3b%3bwoah%3b%2cc0%3b%3bwoah%3b%2cc0%3b%3bwoah%3b%2cc0 ) . 
  interesting , nonetheless . 
  it 's not meant to generate much feedback . 
  it 's a repository of only the very best stuff . 
  a place that anyone can go to and ** know ** that whatever they 've grabbed is well made . 
  the community is at unearthedarcana . 
  boh5e is a place mostly just for critics and the homebrew creators . 
  there really * are n't * that many people that want to play aoe2 these days . 
  there were enough for a remaster to be worthwhile , but there was no way in the hells that a game of equivalent quality relative to its time would be funded by a triple a studio today . 
  audiences back then were just more hungry for rtss than they are today . 
  unfortunately , the market is n't there today . 
  there 's really no good reason that a user should n't be able to just select each of their preferences individually . 
  someone can prefer 24 hour time , british english , and the wrong date format , just as much as they could prefer 12 hour time , british english , and dd/mm/yyyy , or any other combination . 
   in fact , there are more different passwords made out of four words from a 5000 word long dictionary ( 5000 ^ 4 = 6.25 e14 ) than passwords made of eight characters from both cases with numbers and punctuation ( 70 ^ 8 = 5.765 e14 ), 
  if you use only 8 symbols , sure . 
  but at a bare * minimum * , you should be considering 10 symbols to represent when the user presses shift and a number key on a standard keyboard . 
  that alone takes you to 7.22 e14 . 
  even more , you could add in / ? .  , < for the next level of common symbols , and - _ \\ | = + ] } [ { ` ~ , for a grand total of 28 symbols , resulting in 90 ^ ( 8 ) , or 4.30 e15 , a whole order of magnitude better than four words . 
   and no one actually forces you to only use 5000 ; this dictionary of 10k english words by google is quite nice . 
  which is great , if that 's what you use ( although , to nitpick just a little , a heap of things in there are n't english words . 
  i saw `` notre '' , which is french , `` lm '' , which is an acronym or abbreviation , mediawiki , which is a brand name , and wagner , which is a person , just to name a few . 
  ) , but that 's * not * what most people who see randal 's comic are going to use . 
  they 're going to use four words that come into their head . 
  hells , i would n't be surprised if a lot of the people who see it subconsciously follow the same format of adjective noun noun noun , which lowers the attack surface considerably . 
  sure , his * intention * might have been to have people use a pseudorandom generator to pick a word from a massive list , but that 's not what 's going to happen with most people who see that comic . 
  i suspect that people who use this , in reality , are probably picking from a pool more like 2,000 words , if that . 
   the whole point of that comic was that people memorize different kinds of information differently, 
  which is fine . 
  if people only ever needed two or three passwords , it would work pretty well . 
  but people need * dozens * of accounts . 
  banks , email , work , utilities , games , social media , etc. 
  even with a memorable system like this , a person can only manage a small number of passwords . 
  maybe more than they could before , but not enough . 
   do note that i do not suggest having one password for everything either, 
  maybe not deliberately , but encouraging a non-password vault -- based system is tacitly encouraging using a limited number of passwords that get repeated across sites . 
  there 's no way around that . 
   i consider the fact that you have to bring the vault with you everywhere a very serious drawback, 
  so , just gon na completely ignore the most widely used and studied password manager of all , and the main one i said i myself recommend , then ? 
   algorithmic password generators, 
  now , these are certainly a good idea . 
  they have flaws and benefits as compared to password vaults , which means that for some use cases they can definitely be a good idea . 
  i would n't consider them a middle ground , though ; rather , they 're just a different sort of password manager , at essentially the same level as password vaults like lastpass . 
  you 've done a good job of indicating the benefits of them , so i wo n't bother repeating that . 
  but their biggest downside is that they 're a little more difficult to work with in some cases . 
  if you use multiple accounts on the same site , for example . 
  or if you need to change your password for whatever reason . 
  these problems are both solvable ( include username as part of the salt , include an incremental counter as part of the salt ) , but the solutions put an increased burden on the user . 
  the latter is especially burdensome , since now the user has to keep track of the incrementer -- or have an app/vault which does that for them , like [ lesspass ] ( https://lesspass.com/#/ ) . 
  password vault or deterministic password generator is mostly down to a matter of personal preference . 
  both are great . 
   just having an unpublished principle of generating a password increases its security, 
  it really does , because anything that 's published is going to be in attackers ' dictionaries . 
  if it 's not published anywhere and is n't sufficiently similar to an existing published system , it wo n't be in a dictionary . 
  thus , it is only vulnerable to a brute force attack . 
  its entropy is near enough to log_2 ( 94 ^ ( n ) ) , ( 94 being the number of individual characters i counted on a standard us keyboard , n being the total length of the password ) . 
  as an example , let 's say you 're going to use randal 's method , but add a digit in somewhere . 
  let 's imagine two cases , one where you put the number at the end , and the attacker knows this ( or at least can reasonably guess it , because that 's what most people do ) , and the other where the attacker knows you 're using a number , but not where it is . 
  in the former case , you 're adding about 3 bits of entropy : enough information to cover 10 digits . 
  in the other case , they do n't know where it is , and the amount of extra entropy is much higher . 
  security solely through obscurity might as well be no security at all , but that does n't mean it 's a good idea to go shouting out how your security works . 
  it 's much like how good web security these days involves not making it easy to find out what dbms you 're using , or what your server is . 
  that 's just obscurity , but if it 's a little harder for attackers , why not do it ? 
  and that 's much less effective , relatively speaking , than obscuring your password generation technique , since with that they only need to try a handful of different combinations , it 's not a drop from 94 ^ ( n ) to 5000 ^ ( n/5 ) . 
  one other flaw that both randal 's method and deterministic password generators have is dealing with site password requirements . 
  if they require between 8 and 16 characters and at least one of each of the four character types ( aa1 !, 
  ) , randal 's system fails * utterly * , since you 're going to have to reduce to just 3 words , and comparatively short ones at that , and you 've got ta find a way to shoehorn in a number , symbol , and capital letter . 
  with a deterministic system , you 've got the burden of remembering the requirements of the system , and how you met them . 
  if none of the first 16 characters was , by chance , a digit , then you have to remember which 16 other characters you used . 
  not to mention the fact that it was 16 characters in the first place !, 
  again not an insurmountable problem for the deterministic generator , but one to be aware of . 
  hey , since you 've got your answer , and this technically does n't fit within the rules on this subreddit , i 'm gon na remove this post . 
  cheers . 
   i could care less, 
  presumably you mean could n't ? 
  but yeah , at least up until recently ( not 100 % sure if they 're still there ) i knew where there were a couple of blockbusters near-ish to me .
