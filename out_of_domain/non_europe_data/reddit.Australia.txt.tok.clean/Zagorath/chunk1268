  wow , very cool . 
  good luck !, 
  the players are all goblinoids . 
  they spend a little time in the goblin camp doing goblin shit . 
  it 's a festival , they have games : contests of strength , stealth , and stuff . 
  then , the leader asks for volunteers to go on an important mission to reclaim some treasure . 
  pcs go to the place where the treasure is , maybe facing some obstacles on the way . 
  once there , they meet four people : a human fighter , an elf wizard , a dwarf cleric , and a halfling rogue , who are also after the treasure . 
  they fight . 
  but the npc party is higher level and fights with insanely good tactics . 
  unless they get very lucky , your pcs are quickly killed after three to six rounds . 
  do it right , and it 's amazing . 
  you get to spend the time getting a little invested in your characters and their goblinny way of life , but not * too * much , because goblins are weird and they know it 's a one-shot . 
  then , when they die , they come to the realisation that they were playing the npc fodder all along . 
  a really cool reversal of roles . 
  terrible idea for a long campaign , fantastic for a fun quick one-shot . 
  definitely interesting , but i wonder how it would interact with other elements of the game design . 
  bonus action spells , for example , are clearly designed to be able to be used in conjunction with * any * other action in the game ( except another levelled spell ) , so tying them to an attack action would be lame . 
  and how would the rogue 's bonus action disengage/dash work ? 
   where 's the fluff that supports the idea you 're channeling, 
  mostly in the fr novels , and the concept of warlock pacts more broadly in culture . 
   wis is the channeling power stat , clerics use it, 
  personally , i 've always viewed clerics more as channelling the * spell * , not the raw power . 
  a subtle but important difference because it means their power comes from an understanding of the god and their will , and a desire to carry out their god 's wishes , rather than taking raw energy and forcing it into the form of a specific spell . 
   the power from the sorcerer comes entirely from within while the power from the warlock you 've described comes from without, 
  that just explains why warlocks and sorcerers are n't * the same * , from my perspective , not how what they 're fundamentally doing with magic is n't the same . 
   your argument stands for fr warlocks but not phb warlocks, 
  this is absolutely true , but fr is the default setting at the moment , with every subsequent rules book being fr-based , and all but two of the adventures being fr , as well as fr-specific things being the most highly represented in the core three books out of any setting-specific content ( though it 's mostly general stuff , and there is * some * setting-specific stuff for other settings ) . 
  when it comes down to it , if something is posted without details of what setting is being used , and the setting matters , people tend to assume fr . 
  as another example , phb paladins and clerics very specifically do ** not ** need to follow a god . 
  fr paladins and clerics have not had that requirement lifted , to my knowledge . 
  although many groups playing in the fr might lift that rule from the phb and plop it into fr , i 'm not aware of anything that canonically changes the origin of a paladin 's power . 
  to me , the biggest bit of evidence that this is true is that ( a ) the phb is a little vague on the matter , so it 's hard to use definitively one way or the other , and ( b ) warlocks do currently use charisma , so an explanation that results in charisma being the correct stat to use is probably the best one . 
  it 's a post-facto justification , but it 's one that works . 
  this is neither of those . 
  there 's no way it 's a legal use of the art by @probzz . 
  i think it 's morally a fair use , but australia 's current law is * extremely * limited , which is why the current fair use campaign is so important . 
  ninja edit : i should also say , it 's so inconspicuous a use that you 're never going to get in any trouble for it . 
  realistically , it 's a perfectly fine use even today . 
  but on principle , it 's troubling that this is n't strictly legal , and it should be . 
  i considered that , but then you run into the problem of it being essentially the same as if you kept the system as it is today , but said `` you have unlimited bonus actions '' . 
  with this system , a rogue could * both * hide/dash/disengage * and * two-weapon-fight , * and * use bardic inspiration , if she 's multiclassed , and maybe even cast * healing word * , if she 's multiclassed twice . 
  oh , and attack . 
  unless something was written in to say that you can only choose one of these , in which case you have now created an even clumsier version of the bonus action , because now it 's written up on a class-by-class and feature-by-feature basis . 
   do you have anything to do with your bonus action ? 
  they 've already deliberately tried to avoid this ( somewhat clumsily , admittedly ) by saying you do n't `` have '' a bonus action unless a class feature gives you one . 
  it 's incredibly inelegant , though . 
  would have been better just to keep the system from older editions and not effectively have the same , but pretend it is n't . 
  but what he 's describing there is further away from 4e and 3.5 than 5e is . 
  both of those used something akin to bonus actions . 
  ( or at least , i know 4e did , and i 'm pretty sure 3.5 did . ), 
  but anyway , yeah , i 'm not a fan of this at all . 
  between this and his recent ridiculous initiative rules , i 'm starting to get very glad that he 's not the one in charge of rules . 
  square brackets general . 
  oh interesting . 
  the minor action was first introduced in 4e , then ? 
  i 've never had any luck with custom soundfonts , and i 've never managed to figure daws out either . 
  but i 've found the sibelius high quality soundset sounds to be more than adequate for my purposes . 
  sibelius does n't export mp3 , but it * should * be able to export either a wav ( on windows ) or an aiff ( on macos ) , which you can easily convert to mp3 via something like audacity . 
  got ta make sure your audio configuration in sibelius is set correctly ( i use sib7 , so i want it to be `` sibelius 7 sounds '' ) . 
  but i 've experienced myself how finicky that can be to get working properly , so i know the feeling . 
  i 'd do it myself and send you a link to the resultant audio , but the midi file does n't seem to be showing up for me on imslp . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` class '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  it works in this case because, 
  ( a ) it 's a deliberately silly one shot . 
  both the lack of seriousness and the lack of time to get connected with your character help reduce negative effects of them dying . 
  ( b ) it 's what makes the players realise the really cool twist , that in this case , that their characters are a small but part in the lives of a party of heroic adventurers . 
  that 's not to say it absolutely has to be a dm fiat tpk . 
  i learnt about this amazing one shot concept by playing in one , and in that , we managed to take down one of the adventurers , which forced them to retreat . 
  although only one or two of us were still alive by this point . 
  it was through sheer dumb luck and some clever taking advantage of the terrain , but we did manage to throw a spanner in the dm 's works , after which he revealed the planned twist . 
  would have been great either way . 
  it has the same basic concept , but angry 's system is vastly superior . 
  for one , it does n't mess with abilities like * guidance * and jack of all trades which modify initiative . 
  the fact that it uses static modifiers is , in this rare case , an advantage for speed , since players can a little more easily get used to knowing what modifications to make to their initiative . 
  it also does n't penalise movement at all , which is a huge boon . 
  it still has some of the subjective flaws of mearls ' system , like being now unable to react in ways such as deciding to cast * misty step * in response to an enemy coming near you , and then make a cantrip attack as normal . 
  but it gets rid of most of the major glaring issues mearls came up with . 
  i do n't particularly like angry 's system , but to me that seems a subjective judgement of taste , while mearls system is straight up bad . 
  it 's deeply problematic . 
  first , and most importantly , it 's a solution without a problem . 
  bonus actions are ** not a bad thing ** . 
  nobody is complaining about them . 
  if anything , the only complaint i * would * have is the awkward `` you do n't have one unless something gives you one '' wording , which is effectively meaningless . 
  the solution to this problem would be to move in the opposite direction and just make it work like minor actions in 4e . 
  how , in this system , are you supposed to translate things that currently are a bonus action ? 
  twf is fine , he 's answered that . 
  but what about bardic inspiration , * healing word * , cunning action , etc. ? 
  people have bandied about having an `` action '' for bi and ca , but what would this entail ? 
  you get the action and then an attack ? 
  what if you do n't want to attack with your action . 
  what if you want to cast a spell , or use an item , or do something else ? 
  and how do people propose this should deal with bonus action spells ? 
  i 've seen very little discussion of that . 
  the most obvious thing would be that the `` cunning action '' action lets you do what cunning action currently does , and then take another action . 
  but that wording is so incredibly clumsy . 
  what if you use that second action to take the bardic inspiration action ( if mced ) ? 
  you can essentially get infinite bonus actions !, 
  or if the rules specifically say that you can never have more than two actions , you 've now nerfed the fighter and other features which give you an extra action . 
  and regardless of whether or not you have wording to allow the fighter et al.
