  to function as-is , you 've already arrived at a set of rules that are basically making bonus actions work without using the word bonus action . 
  it 's clumsy and pointless . 
  this is n't as bad as mearls ' horrid initiative system , but that 's mainly because it 's incredibly vague and not thought fully through . 
  depending on the answers to the details , it could become pointless but not harmful , to really really terrible . 
  so , is it 9:30 tonight est ? 
  i can make that . 
   i think what people are saying is that it 's the first good one as all those are of questionable quality . 
  considering it has n't come out yet , and especially considering it 's sharing a universe which so far has exclusively contained films of `` questionable quality '' , that seems a bold claim for people to be making . 
  i mean , i still ( somehow ) have hope that they will * finally * be listening to fans and make something good , but i also wo n't be at all surprised if it 's just as bad as mos and bvs . 
  not much of a god if he does n't know about graham 's number . 
  we 've had one and two dollar coins for * decades * . 
  canada is just that far behind . 
  did you make a facebook chat with the discord logo to take this screenshot ? 
  got ta put the reason in [ square brackets ] for it to work properly . 
  good thing god does n't have that limitation then , eh ? 
  i disagree vehemently . 
  the ** only ** thing i want out of a dc movie is something that is faithful to the characters . 
  everything else is of secondary importance to me . 
  if the movie demonstrates that the creators are familiar with the source material , that they * care * about the source material , and that they want to make their creation an expansion of the greater canon for the characters in it , then i 'll be happy . 
  it 's why , despite it generally not being very good , i actually enjoyed the recent assassin 's creed movie . 
  it showed a greater understanding and care for the source material than most of the recent * games * in the franchise have . 
  when the guy at the helm of the universe is someone who literally hates comic books and comic book characters , and has an idea for them that shows utter contempt for the personalities of the characters he 's meant to be portraying , that 's going to turn out bad movies , like bvs and mos absolutely ** were ** . 
  despite the absolutely tragic circumstances in which it happened ( i would absolutely not wish that fate on even my worst enemy ) , i 'm very glad snyder is not going to be seeing justice league to completion . 
  * anyone * would be a better choice to see that movie succeed , but joss whedon * especially * has demonstrated many times that he knows how to make good movies that appeal to both those that care about the characters being used and to the wider audience . 
  lara is an action-adventure hero . 
  she does n't have super powers , but more importantly , she does n't `` save the day '' , or fight bad guys for a reason that could be described as `` the greater good '' . 
  the fact that she appears near-invincible and does things that no real human could do does n't make her a superhero . 
  jack west jr. , indiana jones , and arguably characters like rambo and john mcclane are action heroes who all do things that would probably see a real person be dead , but they are not superheroes . 
  honestly , i do n't think so . 
  i find eclipse and intellij each have their own pros and cons . 
  the biggest con of intellij relative to eclipse , for me , is that its autocompletion does n't work in an intuitive way . 
  in eclipse , when i start writing out `` system.out.pr '' , a thing automatically pops up with a bunch of different possible ways to finish that , including telling me the specification of each of them . 
  intellij supposedly has a way to * make * it do this , but it does n't automatically , and no matter what i 've tried , i ca n't get it working . 
  i find this to be a significant enough problem that i 've generally preferred to stick with eclipse , even if most of the rest of the experience is better under intellij . 
   idea feels like it knows exactly what you want to type out . 
  it 's auto complete features are staggering, 
  i 've found that its autocompletion is exactly why i * do n't * use it . 
  i can never get it to work properly in even the most basic of ways . 
  i type `` system.out.pr '' and a little box pops up showing the various possible ways to finish that , along with their parameters , but it * does n't * provide the full documentation of them in a simple way like eclipse does , which means i have to then go google it , which is a massive slow-down . 
  that 's the primary reason i end up using eclipse most of the time . 
  combat or social skills ? 
  my group * frequently * uses social skills pvp . 
  but it 's important to remember that social skills are only ever `` persuasive '' . 
  if one character manages to beat another using intimidation or persuasion , that does n't mean the losing character necessarily now changes their whole worldview to agree with the other person . 
  instead , the losing player just has to take into account that the other player 's character was very persuasive when making up their own mind . 
  if they still vehemently oppose the idea , that 's fine . 
  combat is a different beast . 
  we 've had it come up a few times , and had mixed success . 
  the very first time was the result of a lot of long-term scheming and build up , with the whole party being involved in some way . 
  one player started planning , relatively early on , to betray the rest of the party at the end of the campaign . 
  some of us caught on to this , and started planning our own countermeasures . 
  everyone was involved in some way , and it all culminated in a big pvp in the final session of the campaign , after the bbeg had been beaten . 
  it was fantastic . 
  but i 've also seen it where two players are just bickering with each other and one decides to attack the other . 
  that was no fun . 
  basically , just use common sense . 
  if you feel like it 's going to make the game more enjoyable , then go for it . 
  if it 's likely to cause problems , try to discourage it . 
  i just tried it out , and it turns out that intellij does give me the function parameters and return type , but it does n't give me the documentation for anything . 
  eclipse does , and that 's invaluable . 
  in nearly every other way , i prefer intellij ( although , having just opened up a project that i was using eclipse for , i 've discovered that my intellij `` can not resolve symbol ` junit ' , when ideally it would recognise that and provide an appropriate way to deal with it when i hover over it , which is what eclipse does ) , but not providing the documentation for methods makes a huge difference for the worse . 
  i had a look at [ a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxavngsax80 ) about live templates . 
  they look vaguely interesting , but like they do something completely unrelated to what i 'm asking about . 
  yeah that 's definitely been how i 've felt for quite some time . 
  the first season was fantastic because it gave these hints of things like the development of the riddler , and it concentrated on the mobster-based villains that we usually associate with an early batman , while building up the idea that most of law enforcement and the courts are corrupt or at best inept , with only a few shining lights like gordon and dent . 
  at the same time , seeing the development of bruce into batman was an awesome driving force of the show . 
  it 's still enjoyable , but it 's definitely not what i had hoped it to be . 
  if it had been like this from the beginning i would never have even started watching it , and it 's only because of how great the first season was that i got hooked into the universe and stayed watching . 
   46 alpha, 
  there are 52 alpha in english and on us keyboards . 
  10 digits , add another 10 for the symbols on top of them . 
  add 11 \\* 2 for the extra purely symbol keys on the standard us keyboard . 
  94 total keys . 
   even five words would be infinitely more memorable than a jumble of letters and numbers and whatnot, 
  true , but the point is to remove the memorisation problem in its entirety . 
  or at least , reduce it to a single password . 
  five truly randomly chosen words plus some symbols and digits ( maybe it 's just their birthday written out as `` dd-mm/yyyy '' or something , to keep it memorable , since adding characters can never reduce entropy , even if the amount added is relatively low such as a birthday would be ) as their master password is a pretty decent idea . 
  heck , why not make it six words plus both their and their parents ' birthdays ? 
  after all , they only need to remember one password anyway . 
  that 's gon na be way easier to remember than even just three websites with unique four word passwords . 
  and everyone has way more than three that they * actually * need to remember . 
   the best password vault in the world is absolutely useless if you do n't have the passwords themselves on hand . 
  right . 
  you 're completely ignoring the fact that the one i 'm recommending * has a web interface * . 
  literally every computer that is capable of accessing the internet can access it , zero extra software or lugging required . 
  it can be a little slow and clumsy as you log in , then enter your password a second time to copy the password to the clipboard ( though you can , after this , have it set to not require you input your password again for a certain duration , so even if you need multiple passwords , 2 is the most times you 'll need to enter it ) , then copy that into the password field of the thing you 're accessing . 
  this precise feature is why i recommend lastpass over everything else , because it solves the problem of needing to lug something around to have access on any computer . 
   still , let 's not rely on it , shall we ? 
  of course not . 
  nobody is suggesting that we should . 
   anyway , with a good choice of password style your generated passwords will comply with most requirements one is likely to encounter, 
  it 's unfortunate , but many sites do have weird requirements . 
  the worst is when they have a maximum character limit , since that means that any good system which comes up with longer ones ( including password managers -- both vault and deterministic -- and randal 's four words system ) is going to have to adapt . 
  vaults adapt to this easily by having the user select a shorter one . 
  deterministic generators rely on the user either remembering that this one is shorter , or storing a ` numchars ` associated with certain websites . 
  some require one of each of the four types of character . 
  this will * usually * be fine with both vaults and deterministic generators , but generators can run into trouble if it just so happens that the result of their preferred system does n't spit out one of that character . 
  the chance of there being no number in a 20 character password is about 10 % ( assuming a 94 character set ) . 
  not a whole lot , but certainly high enough that it could be an issue for many users . 
  non-deterministic systems allow the user to just refresh the randomly generated password until they get one that works .
