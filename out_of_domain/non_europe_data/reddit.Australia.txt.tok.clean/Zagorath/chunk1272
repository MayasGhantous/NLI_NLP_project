  volume is directly proportional to mass , and volume also is proportional to height * cubed * , when the proportions stay the same . 
  that means being a little bit shorter makes you a * lot * less massive . 
  acceleration is inversely proportional to mass . 
  that means decreasing the mass means you can move a lot quicker , with the same amount of total force . 
   i do n't see why [ movement ] should n't [ have a cost ], 
  two reasons . 
  one mechanical , one flavour . 
  in terms of mechanics and gameplay experience , it 's just lame if you plan to attack a creature that 's right next to you , but then because they went first and got to move back by just a few metres , you now can do literally nothing on your turn . 
  that 's not fun . 
  in terms of flavour , following an enemy that backs off is incredibly easy . 
  in fact , in anyone with even a little fighting experience , it 's * instinctual * . 
  it does n't require a conscious effort or planning to do , it 's just what you * do * . 
  it 's also incredibly easy to do while simultaneously moving . 
  see literally any fencing match for an example . 
  possibly even boxing can demonstrate this . 
   the initiative rolls are still counted as ability checks, 
  an ability check is when you roll a d20 and add an ability score modifier to it , and possibly some other static modifiers , including your proficiency or a multiple thereof . 
  if you 're using a bunch of other dice , * not * adding an ability score , that by definition * can not * be an ability check . 
  you * could * add some language like `` any ability which would all you to add or subtract from a character 's initiative roll , or use to alter a character 's dexterity ability check , can be used to alter an initiative roll . 
  subtract any positive alterations , or add any negative ones . '', 
  but that 's clumsy as hell , and i 'm not sure why it 's necessary when just keeping initiative as a dexterity check works perfectly . 
  but anyway , regarding angry 's system , i actually have n't looked at all the specifics . 
  mainly , i think that its fundamental structure is better . 
  static points added/subtracted from the standard dexterity ability check . 
  if you do n't like any specific things adding to or decreasing your initiative , that can be changed . 
  if you want something to have more cost than it does in this system , decrease the amount it adds to your initiative , or increase the amount it subtracts . 
  if you do n't like something having * any * effect , remove it as a factor entirely . 
  or add in new things you want to affect it ( though as explained above , movement is not something that should be added on ) . 
  but most importantly , keep the fundamental structure of a dexterity ability score check . 
  it 's like that missile guidance software that had a memory leak , so they just gave it more memory !, 
  less likely , but still very , * very * much possible . 
  another side effect of this system is that it tightens up the bounds a lot . 
  d6 + d4 for an attack and movement has a pretty high chance of being better than d6 . 
  [ nearly 1/4 , in fact ] ( http://anydice.com/program/bdc1 ) . 
  and if they decide to back away * without * attacking , they 'll get away first much more often . 
  [ over half the time ] ( http://anydice.com/program/bdc2 ) . 
  combine that with [ humans ' tendency to feel a * loss * more harshly than a potential gain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loss_aversion ) , and you 've got a really problematic bit of design . 
   perhaps if a player declared no movement action , but then made an attack of opportunity earlier in the round , they could choose to add 1d4 to their initiative and add a move action . 
  this relies on them getting an opportunity attack ( side note , that 's what it 's called -- and has been called for nearly a decade ) , which may not happen if the enemy chooses to to use the disengage option . 
  i actually think initiative * is * the most important use of joat . 
  most characters mostly use skill checks they 're already good at , because it 's not a solo game , and different team members can be good at different things . 
  sure , this is n't * always * the case , but it frequently is . 
  initiative is the one ability check * everyone * needs to be good at . 
  * guidance * is similar . 
  a lot of the time you 're not going to be able to take full advantage of it because you wo n't see the situation coming , and it only lasts a minute . 
  but most combats you * will * see coming , except on the rare occasion you 're ambushed . 
  and at the same time , the d4 bonus is worth more , proportionally speaking , on abilities you do n't already have large bonuses to in the form of proficiency and one of your main ability score modifiers . 
  besides , even if it * was n't * the primary uses of these abilities , it 's still one that * exists * and is very potent . 
  removing their ability to be used in this way is * definitely * a nerf , at which point it becomes a discussion of whether the nerf is justified . 
  i do n't think anyone was saying these abilities are overpowered before , which means that any nerf probably * is n't * justified . 
  oh yeah definitely . 
  it 's a smart cost/benefit analysis to make . 
  but that does n't change the fact that it 's a really bizarre and humorous solution to the problem , that on first glance * feels * like a `` wrong '' way to do things . 
  sorry for the delay . 
  new version of the bot had a bug . 
  should be fixed . 
  if it ever fails to page within a few minutes , feel free to pm me so i can try and get it fixed asap .

  with just a quick glance , it looks like you 've got the spellslots wrong . 
  it does n't get * any * 9th level spells , and yet it seems like it 's trying to be a full caster . 
   there 's no need to be passive aggressive about such a simple mistake , not everyone has been playing for the past decade, 
  do n't worry so much about it , that comment was just some light-hearted jesting . 
  tongue in cheek . 
  it was n't a serious criticism . 
  ( although , as a side note , i 'd have thought people who have been playing for * less * time would be * more * likely to know the correct term , since it 's only in the really old versions of the game that `` attack of opportunity '' was the name for it . 
  but that 's really not important . ), 
   and i apologize if anything i said came across as arrogant or know-it-all, 
  oh not at all . 
  it was fine . 
   if the standard initiative system worked perfectly then i do n't think we would be having this conversation, 
  ah , do n't confuse what i was saying when i made the claim that initiative as a dex check works perfectly with saying that the * current * initiative system is the perfect one . 
  a changed system can still achieve some interesting things , while keeping initiative as a dex check . 
  specifically : roll initiative every round , and have initiative varied by the type of action you take . 
  i just do n't see what is gained by rolling a bunch of different dice based on what you do , compared to rolling a d20 and adding/subtracting some amount based on what you do . 
  a system like this , versus the standard initiative , most certainly * is * a subjective statement and a matter of personal preference . 
  regarding dex being the master stat , i completely agree . 
  it 's a problem . 
  and i 'm not sure how to go about fixing it . 
  but as part of the design mechanics and flavour of the classes , high dex classes generally * should * be going first . 
  rangers , rogues ( especially assassins ) , and monks are all based around speed , so having a higher initiative makes sense for them . 
  as i said , i really do n't know how to fix the problem , but i kinda feel that finding some way to buff strength and intelligence , and to a lesser extent the other abilities , would be better than trying to nerf dex , because i ca n't think of anything dex does right now that it * should n't * do . 
   assuming i used that correctly, 
  indeed you did . 
  and yeah , that 's definitely a problem the system has . 
  another way of dealing with it is to change initiative from d20 to d10 , although that has the problematic effect of making dex way more powerful , as well as making * guidance * et al. 
  more powerful . 
  i agree decreasing the range of initiative and making someone 's inherent speed more important is probably a good thing , but i do n't quite see varying the dice based on actions as a solution to that problem . 
  not that it 's a bad solution or a good one , but just not one at all , really . 
  it 's a solution to a different problem .

  yeah , 2d10 could work . 
  3d6 would also not be too bad . 
  great for initiative , but they do have problems if they 're used in other scenarios , which is that they make everything easier . 
  since a character who is particularly skilled at a particular task typically only needs to roll about an 8 ( conservatively -- could be considered as low as 6 ) , the lower the variance , the more often they 'll succeed , since more of the curve is greater than the required target .
