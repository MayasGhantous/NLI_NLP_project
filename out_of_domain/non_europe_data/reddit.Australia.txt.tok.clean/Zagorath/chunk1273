  * p ( 3d6 \u2265 8 ) = 0.838, 
  * ( also , for shits and giggles ) p ( 5d4 \u2265 8 ) = 0.9795, 
  but for initiative , since everyone 's rolling against everyone else , this is n't a factor . 
  so it 's a pretty good idea . 
  he also sent a text to someone saying something like `` if you do n't hear from me in two hours , call my lawyer '' . 
  you have to spend in the $ 100 -- $ 300 range ( usually on the lower end of that spectrum , but still ) to get a good pair of running shoes . 
  for shoes with a specialised purpose , like running shoes ( as opposed to casual so-called `` joggers '' , aka trainers aka sneakers ) , costs over $ 100 are pretty useful . 
  not an enormous amount over , beyond a couple hundred and you 're paying for the prestige , but between about 100 and 300 , you 're getting more or less well treated for a good pair of asics . 
  yeah , if we were n't certain before , i 'm pretty sure we are now . 
  it 's got ta be child and/or the areas around it . 
  unless they 've been playing us since march . 
  which would honestly be brilliant . 
  edit : lol autocorrect . 
  child = chult . 
  not correcting it because that 's kinda amusing too . 
   i do n't think it 's fair that [ size ] is already reflected in a creature 's dex modifier , but then also gets a bonus/penalty on top of initiative . 
  reasonable . 
  i do n't particularly feel strongly one way or the other about it . 
  like i said , anything in angry 's system that you do n't like can easily be removed , and this will have a better end result than trying to create a whole new system from scratch involving multiple dice and rewording other features . 
   when a creature flees from you , you still would have the chance to attack with a reaction, 
  if it flees without using the disengage action . 
   if you fear your enemy will move out of your range , then you declare movement as part of your initiative roll just in case . 
  or do n't , run that risk of losing your prey , but on the hope that you will ultimately roll lower and act first, 
  this is not an argument in favour of such a system . 
  this is literally just describing how the system works . 
   i would counter by arguing fencers and boxers are incredibly agile, 
  i would disagree . 
  the general trend is that 10 is average , 12 is good , 14 is very good , and 16 is world-class . 
  characters with stats above 16 are essentially superhuman in that ability . 
  the rare exceptional human might go as high as 18 . 
  someone the likes of einstein or euler might have an int of 18 , for example , but i 'm doubtful that there would be any scientists or mathematicians today that achieve that level . 
  most professional fencers are probably sitting at about 14 -- 16 . 
  although as a side note , i think proficiency in fencing is much more about just that -- proficiency -- than it is dexterity . 
  but that 's * professional * fencers . 
  i am not one of those . 
  not even close . 
  i took it as a hobby and nothing more . 
  my own irl dex would probably best be modelled as around 12 at best . 
  but this following thing is , as i said before , completely instinctual . 
   i 'm already changing rules , i do n't really see why it 's so absurd for me to say that the initiative rolls in my system are still considered ability checks . 
  because they 're * not * . 
  perhaps the * prime directive * of homebrew is to change as little as possible to achieve the desired effect . 
  stuff like `` reflavour existing material if you can . 
  if you ca n't , look at minor tweaks to existing material along with reflavouring , before trying a subclass as an option , before looking at a prestige class or full class . '', 
  similarly , with mechanics , redefining one of the three primary mechanics in the game ( those being the attack roll , the ability check , and the saving throw ) should only be done if there is absolutely no other option . 
  sure , you * could * change the definition . 
  that would work . 
  but it would also be a massive fundamental change to the game , and one that is n't necessary because it ( a ) is introducing a mechanic that could already be equally well achieved just be using an ability check as it exists , or failing that ( b ) could have the same effect achieved through careful wording * without * calling it an ability check . 
  their intent was to mark it with a spoiler tag that would be blacked out . 
  unfortunately that is n't supported on this subreddit , so it ends up looking like a link to reddit.com/spoiler , which is a nonexistent page . 
  terminal velocity for a human \\* is around 53 & nbsp ; ms ^ ( -1 ) . 
  acceleration due to gravity is about 9.81 & nbsp ; ms ^ ( -1 ) . 
  that means , if we ignore air resistance * until * you reach terminal velocity ( for the sake of simplicity ) , we can calculate the distance travelled until you reach terminal velocity using v ^ ( 2 ) = 2as , rearranged to s = v ^ ( 2 ) / 2a . 
  that works out to s = 53 ^ ( 2 ) / 2 \\* 9.81 , which is 143 metres . 
  using d&d 's more archaic measuring systems , that 's equivalent to 470 feet . 
  since d&d 's rules are that you take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet , at terminal velocity you should be taking 47d20 . 
  so yeah , the maths backs it up . 
  raw is too kind . 
  although even so , having * some * maximum value to falling damage * does * make sense , and if you 're falling more than about 500 ft , it should n't matter . 
  of course , this overly simplistic model does n't take into account air resistance until the point you reach terminal velocity . 
  in reality , as you get higher up , you speed up at a lower rate . 
  so while the total maximum damage should still only be about 47d6 , in reality you should n't be taking that much damage until your starting height is all the way up at 500 & nbsp ; , or 1500 & nbsp ; feet . 
  \\* it 's hard to know the terminal velocity for a dragon , because we have no idea what it weighs or its surface area . 
  it 's really big , of course , but it 's also able to fly , which suggests it 's probably surprisingly light for its size . 
  it 's surface area is also going to be pretty big because wings . 
  for the sake of simplicity , i 'm assuming its resultant terminal velocity is the same as a human 's . 
  basically , you can google to find what terminal velocity * is * , and then just pretend that air resistance is a binary thing : if you 're at terminal velocity , acceleration = 0 , if you 're not at terminal velocity , acceleration is 9.81 & nbsp ; ms ^ ( -2 ) . 
  yeah , your physics was all correct , it 's just a bit of weird logic that i was using to keep the maths simple .

   the green spherical tree fruit . 
  i know apples can be either red or green , but i find it interesting that green is the colour you mention . 
  in my mind at least , the prototypical apple is a red one . 
  anyone know why italy uses a word derived from ancient greek , rather than the latin which would have presumably dominated much of their history ? 
  also , what are the various little regions in italy and the one little spot in portugal thag use the latin derived term ? 
   i 'm just saying it 's nowhere near the quality level of daredevil by a million light years, 
  no , you said quite specifically `` the other difference is [ daredevil ] is ... a good show '' , which implies that gotham is * not * a good show . 
  not that it 's not * as * good , but that it 's not good . 
  anyway , personally , i thought daredevil season 2 was * really * weak . 
  i much prefer gotham . 
  though season 1 of daredevil was , imo , better than most of gotham . 
  both are still good , though . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   what edition is this for ? 
  this subreddit is 5e exclusive . 
  i think the reason the show became a lot weaker in seasons 3 onward is because that 's exactly when the diverged from the original show . 
  the first season of each show is pretty much exactly the same in a really obvious way . 
  the second season is a little less obvious , but the power dynamic and the competition between francis and the king is more or less the same as between frank and the president . 
  then the third season played out completely different . 
  they moved away from not only the uk show which was the direct inspiration , but also away from the shakespearean roots which made both shows so compelling . 
  had the third season of the us show been about frank 's downfall , either played straight shakespearean or subverted at the last moment , it would have been way better . 
  `` coincidentally '', 
   some of the mistakes and decisions he made in those seasons reek of subconscious self sabotage, 
  you 've just thrown this out there without any real justification . 
  which decisions ? 
  what makes you think they come across like subconscious self-sabotage ? 
   if they go with the british original plot climax in season 6, 
  i do n't know if this is possible .
