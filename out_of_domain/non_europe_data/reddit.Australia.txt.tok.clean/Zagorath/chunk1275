  there * was * one electorate where the greens came close to winning . 
  in the electorate of noosa , the greens got 21.4 % of the first preference votes , to labor 's 20.5 % . 
  in noosa , it came down to the 9.5 % of pup voters to decide the winner & mdash ; both overall , and in the race for the best left-leaning party between greens and labor . 
  the lnp only needed an extra 1.4 % of total votes to win , so they got that handily , but in theory unless the number of pup voters who preferenced labor [ 2 ] is 1 percentage point more than who preference green [ 2 ] , the greens would be the second strongest party in that electorate . 
  even then though , unless nearly * all * of the pup voters had preferenced greens or labor ahead of the lnp ( which , considering their political stances , was unlikely from the start ) the lnp was * always * going to win anyway . 
  but that 's just * one * seat where they came close . 
  to be able to make a difference politically , they 'd need to win at least a handful of seats and force a hung parliament . 
  winning in their own right is out of the question . 
  oh man , congrats dude !, 
  i still have n't beaten the dark genie . 
  i 've gotten up to him in two separate games , but the last one was over 10 years ago just like you . 
  i 've gotten up to the third stage on a few occasions , but never managed to beat him fully . 
  kinda makes me wish i still had my old ps2 , or maybe want to buy a new ps4 . 
   i doubt the greens are going to win any seats next election, 
  that was sort of my point . 
  one nation might get a couple , but i 'm doubtful of even that . 
  if we had an upper house that uses stv or another proportional system , yeah , they definitely would . 
  but then , so would the greens . 
  in the single-winner system of irv though , they need to get over 50 % support in a seat . 
  in practice , that probably means getting enough votes that the lnp is eliminated first and passes their preferences over . 
   if they finish second to labor in a seat , they can still win , with preferences from the lnp, 
  right , that 's what i 'm talking about in my previous comment . 
  they need to get high enough that the lnp is eliminated before them , and they reach the 50 % mark thanks to the preferences from the lnp & mdash ; not necessarily first preference votes , but 50 % after votes are redistributed . 
  i have to imagine that most of their votes are going to come at the expense of lnp votes , not labor and ** certainly ** not green votes . 
  possibly also many of the former pup voters will vote phon . 
  i also have to imagine that very few labor or greens voters will preference one nation ahead of the lnp . 
  under those assumptions , the only way for one nation to win a seat is to get more votes than the lnp . 
  for one nation to win , assuming the above voting patterns , something quite specific has to happen . 
  on first preferences , one nation has to be ahead of the lnp . 
  the greens have to get eliminated first , passing preferences to labor ( or vice versa , but that 's less likely ) . 
  at this point , labor needs to be * ahead * of the lnp . 
  if labor is behind the lnp , then they will be eliminated first , and most of their preferences will go to the lnp leading to an lnp victory . 
  so both phon and alp need to be ahead of lnp . 
  then , when the lnp is eliminated , most of their votes have to go to phon . 
  if there are enough moderate lnp voters who preferenced alp before phon , alp could reach a majority and win the seat . 
  so enough lnp votes need to go to phon to give them a majority . 
  it 's definitely not impossible . 
  not even especially difficult . 
  but i do think it 's difficult * enough * that at most a handful of seats might go to them , i would think . 
  but i 'll admit , i 've not been watching the polling . 
  i 'm coming at this from a * purely * electoral theory perspective , with almost no insight to the actual way politics is playing out today . 
  you only really need one level in fighter ( preferably your first level ) to turn a rogue into a faramir/ithilien-style ranger . 
  light on the nature/tracking stuff , heavy on the fighting using longbow through predominantly stealthy methods , while also being capable of charging out in full plate when necessary . 
  that 's true . 
  and at that point , you 're only one level away from an expanded crit range , which is really sweet if your main is rogue . 
  in fact , i can see a case for wanting to go as high as 5 in fighter , but i do n't think i 'd ever go higher than that for this concept . 
  really though , i 'd probably go fighter 3 / rogue x. 
  but for the purposes of succinctly answering op 's question , i went with 1 , which gets you the core of the concept . 
  the sort of actors who * can * charge that much money for a photo do n't * need * the supplemental income . 
  1 week `` this comment gives good feedback on ua '', 
  fuck the al. 
  a tiny fraction of games are played there , and it already has enough shitty limitations on players and dms . 
  the stuff designed for the rest of us should n't be beholden to their shitty rules . 
  seriously , who are these people that did n't like the patron specific invocations ? 
  from what i saw everyone loved it . 
  players loved it for the awesome extra flavour , it 's good for dms because it provides balance restrictions , and the homebrew community especially loved it for opening up a new design space . 
  i do n't think it 's an unpopular opinion . 
  from what i saw last time , everyone loved it . 
  players got awesome new options with strong flavour attached , dms got options that were more easily balanced for , and we here as homebrewers got an entire new design space to work within . 
  all the comments i saw last time were positive about that design . 
  who are these people that did n't like it ? 
  i know i 'm really upset about the change , and i 'll be providing feedback to that effect when they give us the chance . 
  edit : damn autocorrect, 
  man , fuck that shit . 
  the al is a load of crap and if the rest of us are getting options with a worse design to compensate for the load of dead weight wizards is so attached to , just fuck all that shit . 
  i never participated in the wider d&d community for 4e , but i absolutely loved this race . 
  they have such an incredibly strong and awesome flavour to them , with their ties to the living gate and their different philosophies relating to keeping it secure , plus the emotions thing . 
  it was the first character i played that i built myself . 
  what was wrong with the psychic classes ? 
  i played a shardmind psion and it played out just fine . 
  the tighter balance of 4e meant it was n't able to do the stupid things that 5e 's mystic can . 
   solution would be ... to change the movie settings to stereo . 
  i thought your os does this automatically if your speakers are 2.1 or 2.0 ? 
  it means autocorrect is racist . 
  should be `` new '' . 
  honestly , i 'm worried it 's because the people with a neutral or positive opinion are way less likely to fill out the survey . 
  i know i usually only fill them out if i feel strongly about some change being necessary , or if i really ** really ** like it . 
  if i feel & mdash ; as i did with the last warlock invocations one & mdash ; that it 's good , but i do n't have a particularly strong feeling towards it , i 'm not gon na bother . 
   i recall saint-saens walking out of the rite of spring premiere . 
  probably apocryphal . 
  there 's not really even evidence that saint-sa\u00ebns * attended * the premiere . 
  besides , even if it were true , the story is that saint-sa\u00ebns walked out right at the very beginning because he was upset at how stravinsky made the bassoon play that top c. unrelated to the ( also exaggerated ) stories of the riots at the comparatively atonal piece . 
  might 've been more than just the pitch of the bassoon part then . 
  i 'm not sure , but the way i 've heard the story ( and again , it 's most likely apocryphal * anyway * ) was that he stormed out because of the bassoon part , with him having ( supposedly ) said `` if that 's a bassoon , then i 'm a baboon ! '', 
  i guess i just always * assumed * that was due to how high in its register it was playing . 
  main is an int because it returns 0 if it finished successfully , and returns various integers representing different errors . 
  in most compilers ( or possibly even the language spec itself , i 'm not sure ) , ` return 0 ` is inserted automatically if it does n't contain an explicit return . 
  still better than putting the opening brace on its own line . 
  ( ) : brackets, 
  [ ] : square brackets, 
  { } : braces and/or curly brackets, 
  source : non-american english, 
  i thought there was a string or something that we could n't see lifting it from above . 
  it was obvious he was n't really lifting a log , but i thought the log was real , except he was getting help with the lifting part . 
  i thought there might somehow have been a cable connecting it to a crane or something above , that we could n't see because of video editing and/or bad video quality . 
  presumably you mean prescriptivist . 
  but even then , i would maintain that you are wrong , and that brackets is what the normal round ones should be called . 
  parenthesis is a useful generic term that can described the purpose of brackets , commas , and em dashes . 
  i 've literally never heard the term parenthesis used to refer to brackets in real life . 
  i 've lived in australia , korea , and vietnam , and been surrounded primarily by people of those nationalities as well as various european nationalities , especially british .
