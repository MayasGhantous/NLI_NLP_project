  the uk and us are suffering many of the same problems with wage growth , cost of living , and cost of housing that we do , but they * also * ended up going in to recession . 
  meanwhile , they both also have much higher levels of inequality and much lower levels of social mobility . 
  we 're not perfect . 
  ** far ** from it . 
  but we 're better than a lot of places . 
  long press on the wifi network you want to write to nfc , and press `` write to nfc tag '' . 
  a quick google suggests this was introduced on lollipop , so if yours are older than that it might not work . 
  i just thought it was amusing that the guy i was responding to seemed completely oblivious of the point that the guy * they * responded to was making . 
  i think this bot is incredibly useful . 
  youtube links are not themselves very informative . 
  it 's nice to know what the video actually is before clicking on it , since a lot of the time they get posted without enough context to know exactly . 
  it 's only a link to the twitter profile , not to a particular tweet . 
  i do n't think there are bots that do that . 
  if i remember correctly , my school 's cas coordinator told us at the start of year 12 that they would allow cas activities starting as early as july between years 11 and 12 . 
  but yeah , i think it 's mostly down to your school . 
  yeah , but a computer science or software engineering course should n't be teaching languages , it should be teaching fundamental concepts . 
  they 'll need to pick a handful of languages to work with , and that 'll involve necessarily teaching the syntax of those languages , but fundamentally most of what gets taught should be to allow students to work in a wide variety of languages . 
   steam-sniping popular csgo streamers and getting their chat to spam #modgreek until the streamer caves in, 
  i 'm not 100 % sure what all of that means , but it sounds like a dick thing to do . 
  bard is my answer as well . 
  but not * quite * for the same reason . 
  for me the biggest problem is that the mechanics of the class do n't really mesh with the flavour that most people expect of a bard . 
  it 's their idea of bard-as-arcane-spellcaster that does n't make sense to me . 
  if you removed the spells that do n't make sense as magically-charged music and/or speech , and got rid of magical secrets as a feature , i feel like i could really like it as a class . 
  but a bard casting * feather fall * , * light * , or * heat metal * & mdash ; let alone a * fireball * does n't fit with the flavour of the archetypal bard . 
   no self-respecting bard would ever wear a fanny-pack , yet the spell component pouch is mechanically superior for a bard, 
  i have the same problem , to a lesser degree , with wizards . 
  surely , nearly nobody ever thinks of a wizard without thinking of a wand , staff , or similar arcane implement . 
  but it 's ( slightly ) mechanically better for them to forego the arcane focus for the component pouch . 
   which edition you 're using to represent your idea of the archetypal bard, 
  i 'm not looking specifically to any edition of d&d , but more to the broader cultural concept of the bard . 
  characters like the pied piper stand out to me as what the bard should be , and monsters like the satyr generally have a bardic style of magic to them in fiction , and looking at the pipes variant for the 5e satyr monster , it fits pretty well . 
  spells like * sleep * , * dominate x * , * charm person * , and maybe even extending into * healing word * ( since hp is an abstraction that includes things like the will to go on ) , and of course * vicious mockery * etc. , are the perfect examples of spells that make sense for the bard to have . 
  basically , persuasive social effects , buffs to party members , and nerfs to enemies which can be flavoured as tricks of the mind . 
  looking at previous editions , the best incarnation of the bard is probably 4e 's , since its powers recognised this , and mostly seemed to attempt to ensure they worked for the concept of someone using the power of the spoken word to create magical effects . 
  looking at the 5e spell list , just the cantrips and 1st level spells , the ones i would remove are blade ward , dancing lights , light , mage hand , mending , message ( maybe ) , minor illusion ( maybe letting audible illusions remain ? 
  ) , prestidigitation , thunderclap ( probably , but not definitely ) , true strike , comprehend languages ( maybe ) , detect magic , disguise self ( maybe & mdash ; could arguably reflavour it as you reaching into * their * mind to change how they perceive you ) , earth tremor , faerie fire , feather fall , identify , illusory script , longstrider , silent image , speak with animals , thunderwave ( probably , not definitely ) , and unseen servant . 
  that 's roughly two thirds of the list ( 23 out of 34 , by my count ) , which is hugely problematic . 
  it means that nerfing it to only allow the spells that make sense as purely magically laced words or music is a * significant * nerf to the class . 
  and then magical secrets is an entire ability that many see as one of the most powerful and potent abilities , which nearly entirely does n't fit the broader archetype . 
  the bard suffers , a little like the ranger ( although in my opinion the ranger suffers this a lot less ) , from having a mechanical tradition in d&d that does n't do a very good job of fitting the broader cultural archetype . 
  and i would much rather have a class that fits the broader vision than the weird mechanical history of the game . 
  i do n't give a shit what decisions were made over a decade ago , that should have no bearing on the game today . 
  it very rarely matters for wizards , which is why i said `` slightly '' , but you need to be always holding your arcane focus in your hand to cast a spell ( or use your free `` item interaction '' to draw it out & mdash ; but then you ca n't put it away again ) . 
  with a component pouch , drawing out the components you need is included for free as part of the action , letting you have a hand free . 
  if you , for example , wanted to be wielding a weapon in one hand , using the other hand to interact with the environment and/or grapple , or wield a two-handed weapon , then a component pouch is the only option . 
  ~ ~ edit : oh , just remembered . 
  you can use the hand holding an arcane focus ** only if ** the spell also has a material component . 
  for spells with only somatic , or somatic and verbal components , the hand holding a focus ca n't be used for the somatic components . 
  that means that if one hand has a weapon , and the other has a focus , * you ca n't cast vs or s spells * , raw . 
  now , most reasonable dms will probably ignore this , but if you 're stuck playing in a strictly raw campaign , then that 's a fairly substantial nerf . 
  it will affect bladelocks , bards , and spellsingers more than most other casters , but it could at least in theory cause some problems for anyone . ~ ~, 
  turns out the stuff in the edit was wrong . 
  yay !, 
  4e did a lot of great things . 
  making everyone able to be useful all throughout the day . 
  removing mechanical implications of alignment . 
  removing stupidly detailed and complicated skill systems . 
  simplifying mechanics for out-of-combat situations to allow for greater flexibility and roleplay rather than being bogged down by mechanics . 
  these are all things that 5e inherited to one degree or another . 
  please , at least * try * to engage with the argument on its own merits . 
  do n't dismiss it just because of a blind irrational hatred of 4e . 
  why i find particularly interesting is that they also seem to be avoiding the south route near jordan , israel , and egypt . 
  for a flight from doha to paris , diverting south as far as the very southern tip of israel is the same distance as going north while skirting the edge of iraq . 
  cut closer & mdash ; say , go directly over jerusalem & mdash ; and the southern route is a lot shorter . 
  the same is more or less true of doha to london . 
  ( source : google maps ' `` measure distance '' feature , which i * think * is using the great-circle distance . ), 
  so it seems they 'd rather avoid that direction to , if they can . 
  i had an extension for a while that was supposed to stop duplicates . 
  but annoyingly it did n't work properly so i ended up with them anyway . 
  i have tabs on my laptop that i have n't looked at in two years . 
  until earlier this year i had one tab that was four years old . 
  i 'll get to them eventually . 
  firefox does a crap job of it . 
  or at least it did two years ago when i last tried switching back to it . 
  maybe it 's better now . 
   it 's actually all written as on big gliss from low g to the high c, 
  sounds like you got a weird arrangement . 
  it 's actually written as [ a 17-tuplet scale ] ( https://image.slidesharecdn.com/gershwin-george-rhapsody-blue-rhapsody-blue-1st-clarinet-pdf-38818-130207135934-phpapp01/95/gershwin-georgerhapsodybluerhapsodyblue1stclarinetpdf38818-1-638.jpg?cb=1360245610 ) with no glissando at all in the notation . 
  that 's just something that the clarinetist at the premiere decided to do , gershwin liked it , and clarinetists since have all done it by convention . 
  edit : [ here 's the autograph score ] ( http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rhapsodyinblueink-noreflection-loc-web.jpg ), 
  edit the second : also , you usually do n't play the first part chromatic , but diatonic . 
  play the notes more or less as written until you get past the break . 
  i tend to agree with you there . 
  the contrast from the dirty glissadi to the really sharp ( not pitch-wise ) top f works really well . 
  i did n't know [ ed greenwood ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/sites/default/files/media/images/edgreenwood_interview_image.jpg ) was in to classical music . 
  i 've learnt to do it into a straw and a glass of water ( was actually quite easy , took a couple of days practising during meals ) , but maintaining my embouchure while doing it is something i 've never managed . 
  i ran bash as administrator ( as in , right click its icon in the start menu and hit `` run as administrator '' ) and it let me do it . 
  a little annoying that using ` sudo ` does n't let you emulate being an admin , but it 's nice to know that it is actually possible . 
  i know you did n't quite tell me that 's what was necessary , but your comment gave me the idea , so thanks !, 
  i 've just listened to a few , and it sounds to me like they mix it up a little . 
  a lot of them play diatonic for the first bit , and then play the throat tones chromatically , before switching to glissando in the clarino register . 
  honestly i prefer the version in the op 's link . 
  something about this one sounds too perfect . 
  too calculated . 
  also :, 
  when you roll a natural 20 ... 
   i roll to attack the goblin . 
   you hit . 
  you roll twice as many dice for damage .
