  nothing absurd , gruesome , or reality-bending happens . 
  grognar , your turn . 
  ( but do n't tell / r/dndgreentext that . 
  especially do n't remind them that you ca n't crit on skill checks ! ), 
  i do n't necessarily think knowing the exact words is necessary , but have programme notes ( hopefully the venue will provide good ones , but spend 5 minutes making your own based on the wikipedia page & mdash ; that big table is really handy & mdash ; just in case , or alternatively just google and find some other orchestra 's programme notes ) and follow along with the general meaning of each movement . 
  it 's more important to know the general mood orff is trying to convey than the specific meanings of the words . 
  as / u/epistaxis says , most of the audience would n't have known the exact meaning at the premiere . 
  i currently have 24 tabs open on my desktop ( even more if you count the ones on my desktop 's second partition ) and 27 on my laptop . 
  maybe 5 of them i actually plan on doing something with in the next few hours . 
  i have a problem . 
  i 've brought up my gripe with bards a lot of times in the past , but never once has anyone come up with an argument in favour of them that 's even * close * to as convincing as this one was . 
  i 'm still not sure i * like * them , but this one at least lets me understand better why some people do . 
  thanks . 
  hmm . 
  curious . 
  are you running something that 's a long way from stock android , perhaps ? 
  or maybe you 've got nfc turned off ? 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` spell '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  the base class definitely has a ` deal-with-the-devil ' side to it , but that definitely ** does not ** mean the base class is meant for evil characters . 
  in fact , that 's kinda where their appeal comes from . 
  a character that is being pulled toward the dark , but is n't necessarily going to end up there . 
  think luke 's arc from star wars , especially episode vi . 
  it provides a natural point of conflict for the character , which is a way to provide fodder for a character arc or story , which can be so fulfilling and dramatic . 
  what was the event that caused you & mdash ; a good person & mdash ; to form a pact with an evil entity ? 
  how do you live up to your side of the bargain ? 
  how far are you willing to go ? 
  it 's one of the only classes ( the paladin being the only other class that even gets * close * , in my opinion ) that provides a natural in-built hook to make you flesh out your character and provide a deep , dramatic , and engaged pc that you can form an attachment to . 
   if you ca n't succeed , you do n't roll, 
  if you ca n't succeed , you do n't roll . 
  if you * can * succeed , then a 20 * already * succeeds ( by definition , since a 20 results in the highest score your character can possibly get ) , and thus a natural 20 has no effect . 
  thus , unless the dm is the unreasonable sort willing to allow a 20 to allow a player to succeed on something that would otherwise be impossible , a skill check can not `` crit '' . 
  as the others have said , / r/unearthedarcana deals with homebrew , not with worldbuilding . 
  i 'm removing this post . 
  you might be better off asking on / r/dndnext or / r/worldbuilding ( although i 'm not sure what sort of content the latter permits & mdash ; this * may * not be appropriate there either ) . 
  hey , just so you know , this subreddit does n't allow questions or requests to be submitted as main posts . 
  you can see the rules of most subreddits in their sidebar . 
  if you want to ask a question in the future , click on the arcana forge megathread , which you can always see near the top of the subreddit . 
  for now though , since you 've got an answer , i 'm removing this post . 
  i just want to point out the difference between irv and stv , because it 's kind of important . 
  australia uses irv in our house of reps , but our senate uses stv . 
  stv is a proportional voting system , in that it elects multiple winners per voting district ( in australia , that 's per state ) , and it does so in a way roughly proportional to voters ' wishes . 
  this has the effect of making the rankings of choices * much * more important , because * everyone * has their votes redistributed at some point . 
  even if your first choice is elected , your vote is passed on to your second preference with a weight proportional to how many surplus votes your first choice got . 
  mr tideman is proposing a system that is based on stv , but varied to prevent a particular problem that both stv and irv can present in some cases . 
  even in irv , though , there 's also the matter of funding . 
  in many countries , receiving a certain amount of first preference votes entitles you to federal funding for your next campaign . 
  second tier parties in australia like the greens reach this threshold nearly all the time , which they could not do if irv were instituted and voters were required to be more strategic . 
  even if the eventual winner was not decided by redistributions , it definitely matters . 
  i 'm also a bit sceptical where you got your 5 % figure from . 
  at the last federal election , the seats of adelaide , batman , braddon , cowan , griffith ( a particularly startling change after preferences ) , herbert , hindmarsh , jagajaga , longman , lyons , macquarie , mayo , melbourne ports ( ** very ** interesting & mdash ; winner got 27 % first preference , runner up got 42 % ) , moreton , and richmond were won by a candidate who was behind on first preference votes . 
  that 's a total of 15 seats out of 150 , or 10 % . 
  and that 's without accounting for all the seats where second preferences definitely mattered , but just happened to go to the party that received the plurality of first preferences , and for the fact that it allows minor parties and independents to rise up * at all * . 
  the seat of melbourne , for example , was won by adam bandt of the greens for the third time in a row , and while he got a plurality of first preferences this time , he was only able to get enough votes in the first place to make it into parliament because voters felt safe knowing that doing so would not increase the chance of their least favourite parties winning . 
  hence bandt got 23 % in 2007 , and won the seat in 2010 off the back of 36 % of first preferences ( putting him in 2nd place before votes were redistributed ) . 
  that 's clear evidence of irv eliminating the spoiler effect both in voters ' minds and in reality . 
  a similar thing seems to be playing out currently in melbourne ports and batman at present . 
  except for all the good stuff , like tieflings and dragonborn and the shadowfell and asmodeus 's apotheosis .

  causes the river to flood because of crying so much over her dead brother ? 
  isis . 
  the secular version is `` merry christmas '' , because christmas has * long * since been primarily about the birth of some jewish dude . 
  it 's a secular holiday with a religious history . 
  exactly my point . 
  i do n't know . 
  are we ? 
  huh !, 
  well designed surveys should use the `` required question '' option as minimally as possible . 
  this allows someone to not answer it as a way to get across `` i do n't know '' or `` this question does n't apply to me '' . 
  for example , as someone not in america and not surrounded by latinos , the `` how accurate do you think it is '' and `` how much do you think trump changed stuff '' questions are n't really relevant . 
  also a `` do you feel '' question should not have `` agree '' as an answer . 
  that does n't syntactically parse . 
  wait you have to pay for synergy now ? 
  is it expensive ? 
  i 've been using it for ages . 
  sounds like synergy , and it lets you not only mouse and keyboard across multiple computers ( cross-platform even ) , but will even automatically sync your clipboard so you can copy and paste stuff between them . 
  only thing that makes it different from just having an extra screen is that you ca n't drag windows across , and that it can do weird things with fullscreen games . 
  there 's nothing hilarious about awesome productivity tools . 
  this was auto-filtered by reddit 's site-wide spam filter . 
  i 'm manually approving it because i can see it 's clearly a google images link , but in the future try to always link * directly * to whatever it is you want to share . 
  do n't use link shorteners . 
  damn , looking at the feature list that * does * look better . 
  syncing audio , dragging and dropping files yes please !, 
  except that nowhere on the page mentions mac support , and my quick google seems to also suggest that it does * not * support macos . 
  the price is also quite steep ( compared to synergy , which at least at the time i got it , was free , though apparently now is no longer ) , especially if you want encryption , which i view as kind of a basic requirement , rather than a nice-to-have bonus . 
  synergy has had copy paste between computers for * aaages * . 
  like , the last version that they had out for free before they went paid-only has it . 
  that 's a version from like 2012 . 
  this is so bad , it goes beyond the mariland point , back in to just being bad , and then * back * into the mariland point , and then * again * falls back into being just bad . 
  it 's really quite a marvel . 
  the bottom two look like corporate logos . 
  i do n't mind the other four though . 
  hello internet , somewhere probably in the earlier episodes . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge , but all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  a pretty well designed survey over all . 
  it seemed to lack a `` back '' button to fix any mistakes anyone may have made , which is a design problem ( and it 's also the reason i did n't test whether this survey had the common flaw of marking too many questions `` required '' ) . 
  biggest problem i noticed with questions was in the demographics .
