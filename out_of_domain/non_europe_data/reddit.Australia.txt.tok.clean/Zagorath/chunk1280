  in australia we use both in word form , but it 's * always * dd-mm-yyyy . 
  you never abbreviate with the month first because that makes no fucking sense . 
  spaces make working with command lines so much of a pain . 
  got ta escape it . 
  fine , easy enough . 
  oh , you 're passing it through ssh to another computer ? 
  uhh , sorry , not sure how to deal with that . 
  could you try escaping it again ? 
  so now you got ta put in like three back slashes so one escapes another which escapes the space at the other end , while the third escapes the space locally . 
  urgh it 's such a pain . 
  i thought fabric was measured in length , using a fixed width . 
  i know next to nothing about fabric though so i 'm probably wrong . 
  if you 're chatting , maybe using messenger.com rather than the main site would help ? 
  it 's not a fantastic solution , but might be better than nothing . 
  facebook messenger has been constantly crashing for me . 
  like , any time i get a notification and click on it in the notifications pane , the app crashes and i get a little pop up asking me if i want to send crash statistics . 
  has anyone else been getting crashes lately ? 
  anyone know if anything can be done to stop it ? 
  it 's been going on for months now and i 'm just sick of it . 
  on top of the shitty new `` features '' like being a snapchat clone and the `` rooms '' that it tries to shove at you , i 've finally just said enough is enough and uninstaller it . 
  it used to be so good . 
  up until earlier this year i swore by messenger as the best chat application out there . 
  it kinda makes me sad that it 's stopped caring about being a good app . 
  one thing i found interesting was [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/antonygreenabc/status/873007539323109378 ) by antony green , the abc 's election analyst , where he points out that this election saw such a low amount of third-party voters that may had a higher vote for the conservatives than * thatcher * did in '83 and ' 87 . 
  homebrewery works fine on mobile , though ? 
  what browser are you using ? 
  because it works fine for me in both the reddit is fun included mini-browser and in chrome proper . 
  double tapping even automatically zooms to the correct column . 
  you 'll find very few places are welcoming of requests for content that 's going to be used commercially in return for nothing more than ` exposure ' . 
  and even fewer places will be welcoming of such a post without first requesting permission from the mods . 
  even still , this subreddit has quite clear rules in the sidebar , and before posting * anywhere * , one should make sure to be aware of the rules of the community . 
  requests are never permitted outside of our arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top . 
  it 's that megathread that / u/swordmeow was trying to point you to . 
  this is much more useful , thanks !, 
  poor lib-dems , greens , and , dare i say it , ukip . 
  but especially lib-dems . 
  they deserved over double snp , but got a third of them . 
  it 's no wonder they 're the only major party advocating for a saner electoral system ( and have been [ since at least ' 87 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) ) . 
  damn , that 's even worse . 
  really should ** not ** be charging extra for ssl . 
  these days that should be a basic assumed feature . 
  you 've met superman ? 
  yeah , that confirms it . 
  this dude is batman . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
   perform well in combat, 
  this is rather vague . 
  what do you want to do , precisely ? 
  deal a lot of damage ? 
  soak up a lot of damage ? 
  help your friends do a lot of damage ( either by buffing them or debuffing enemies ) ? 
  the druid is the king of soaking up damage , and depending on how you build it , it can be okay at the other aspects . 
  try opening the link in chrome . 
  or switch to rif ( the official reddit app is known to be kinda terrible ) . 
  it 's been crashing regularly for me for weeks , if not months . 
  i finally just gave up and uninstalled the thing . 
  if facebook ca n't be bothered making an app that works , fuck 'em . 
  is this a different form from the last one ? 
  edges have a nice roughness to them , rivers make sense , cities and towns seem to be placed in logical locations . 
  looks pretty damn good to me !, 
   they were separated though . 
  evidence suggests otherwise . 
  can anyone explain the hidden shrine of tamoachan to me ? 
  room 1 , from the map , seems to be the very last room players will enter , but its treasure indicates a key that is used to open ... the door into that very room ? 
  room 2 has the log trap which it says blocks the whole path . 
  how 's that meant to work ? 
  ca n't they just step over or under it ? 
  i 'm a little lost . 
  what does this mean/what us this referencing ? 
  and the fearless ferret on kim possible . 
  love that list of approved photographic equipment . 
  it 's basically `` any type of camera you can think of , and also tripods '' . 
  i guess those old twin-lens reflex cameras are n't allowed , maybe ? 
  and strictly speaking a monopod might not be allowed ? 
  katanas are usually used with a somewhat * different * technique to european longswords , it 's true . 
  but it 's not an enormously more * difficult * technique , and it 's * certainly * not a technique that is `` finesse '' in a way that the longsword is n't . 
   allows you to use a longsword as a finesse weapon, 
  no , it allows you to use a longsword * with dexterity * . 
  this is not the same thing , most notably because you can not use sneak attack with it , even if you multiclass kensei/rogue . 
  if you 're interested in it , the youtube channels [ scholagladiatoria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/scholagladiatoria ) , [ skallagrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/skallagrimnilsson ) , and to a lesser extent [ lindybeige ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/lindybeige ) ( he does a much larger portion of videos about different topics than the others ) are well worth looking in to . 
  there 's also [ metatron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucijgkyrdt4gja0vlo40rlow ) , but personally i find him hard to watch , and [ shadiversity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/shadmbrooks ) , who has a really grating style imo , and does videos on slightly different topics , though still related to medieval weaponry . 
  all of these creators have videos comparing longswords to katanas , knights to samurais , etc. 
  rapiers are much longer than smallswords , and they 're not light weapons by any stretch . 
  they 're actually about the same weight as many more traditionally shaped `` swords '' like arming swords . 
  they 're slender , but very , * very * long , and that begets quite a lot of weight . 
  the smallsword might be roughly equivalent to the fencing \u00e9p\u00e9e , but the rapier is a much bigger weapon . 
  [ here 's a good scholagladiatoria video on the topic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7zv2grpgac ) . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  also consider looking at / r/dndhomebrew to see if your request has an answer there . 
  best of luck . 
  beefing up the dragonborn is certainly not a bad goal , but i 'm not sure making them more colour based is a good idea . 
  canonically , the dragonborn are all relatively diluted in terms of their colour heritage , and while they express their colour in terms of their breath weapon , they do n't * look * like their colour , and indeed there is very little impact of their `` colour '' upon them . 
  to copy and paste a response i received by / u/stealth _ elephant when saying more or less the same thing :, 
   for the somatic components , that 's _ not _ how the rules are written . 
  that 's the designers , flooded with questions , remembering that `` it works because of the rule that somatic components can be performed using the same hand as material components '' and denying the antecedent to incorrectly conclude that without a material component the focus ca n't be used to perform somatic components . 
   that 's not what the written rules say . 
  the written rules say,
