  she 's not a very good pianist . 
  she has very good technical ability , but plays with very little emotion or subtlety . 
  hence , her performance * might * have * as much * emotion as the computer-made one . 
  kinda the opposite , actually . 
  musescore , being an electronically generated performance , has no emotion in it whatsoever , and the claim was that she * might * have * as much * emotion as it . 
   even the divine/arcane distinction in 5e does n't have any mechanical benefit, 
  then why put that in , even ? 
  it seems like they wanted to pander to players of old editions , rather than considering what made more sense , which is having various power sources . 
   whichever of the new hl mathematics courses they take . 
  this sounds interesting . 
  are there going to be multiple different hl maths courses , but not further maths ? 
  what will the different ones be , then ? 
  over 36 , under 18 . 
  i mean , it 's not even correct . 
  fahrenheit goes from stupidly cold outside to very hot . 
  celsius goes from very cold ( in fact , water will freeze ! ), 
  to `` dead '' if it 's a person , but usefully , water boils . 
  you guys never properly made the switch . 
  here in aus we use metric * universally * . 
  d&d is literally my only exposure to the archaic measuring system . 
  everything from car speed to personal height to energy in food is in metric ( km/h , cm or metres , kilojoules , respectively ) . 
  we as a nation decided in the '70s that we would switch , and then we did , one unit at a time , but when a unit was changed , it was ** changed ** , no more using the old one in any official capacity . 
  some old curmugeons probably kept using the out dated measurements , but younger people are now brought up in a completely modern world . 
  most of the time it does n't bother me a whole lot to work in archaic units for d&d , since it fits the world . 
  but it does cause problems with imagining things . 
  i always think of a square as a fairly small area , about one step , so it 's only when i consciously go to the effort of thinking how big it really is that i realise it 's 1.5 metres , which is pretty substantial . 
  and when you `` dash '' , i always think of it as sprinting , it 's only through consciously converting units ( something that is painfully difficult to do thanks to the nonsensical nature of these archaic units ) that i realise it 's the pace of a brisk jog -- 60 ft. per 6 second round is close to 5:00 minutes per k. 
  out of interest , what do you measure fuel efficiency in ? 
  miles per litre sounds like it would make the most sense for you , but i 'd find it hilarious if you use miles per gallon or kilometres per litre or something . 
  true , but most of his more well-known works are quite romantic . 
  generally speaking , his third symphony is regarded as the beginning of the romantic period . 
  so , even though some of his pieces after that are more classical than the eroica itself , the bulk of what he 's known for is more of an early romantic style . 
  all the `` good '' symphonies ( 3 , 6 , and 9 are particularly good at being examples of romantic era stuff , for different reasons -- the idealism , the programme , and the choral symphony , respectively ) , most of the famous sonatas ( path\u00e9tique and moonlight seem to be the only famous ones earlier than this , and i would argue they both show strong signs of early romanticism too , especially the first movement of path\u00e9tique and last of moonlight ) , the last two piano concertos , the triple concerto , and the middle and late quartets , all come after eroica , to name a few . 
  not that all of these are more romantic than classical , but i think most of the famous ones are . 
   ca n't quickly reach for google and ask something without going through 10 forum links to be sure if the answer given is right . 
  really ? 
  i 've usually been able to answer any questions i 've had using google . 
   ca n't find official rules and content online, 
  all the official rules , and some of the official content , is available under the srd , and is thus available online aplenty . 
  lots of sites with pirated content out there too , especially monsters and spells . 
   why should i care about buying crap anyway ? 
  i do n't really , but it used to give me an excuse to hangout at the hobby shop and geek out with some people, 
  then why do you care what 's `` official '' ? 
  people are still making shit . 
  this is the most popular edition of the game ever , there 's plenty of third party support . 
  heaps of stuff that 's system neutral , too , like game mats , monster/character tokens/minis , etc. 
   where are the lore centric dm fuel books, 
  like scag and volo 's guide to monsters ? 
  they 're on the shelves at your local game store . 
   what about the novels ? 
  wizards of the coast has sadly decided to discontinue them . 
  but that 's only happened starting * this year * . 
  we 've had nearly 3 years of novels set in 5e 's forgotten realms . 
  i 'd recommend starting with the sundering series , and picking up whatever other books you enjoy following on from that . 
  personally i love erin m. evans ' `` brimstone angels '' series . 
  there are 6 books in the series . 
  the first two are 4e , but the third one is in the sundering and the last three are solidly 5e ( with subtle tie-ins to premade adventures like out of the abyss and storm king 's thunder -- they do n't connect in any serious way , just subtle references ) . 
  they 're designed in such a way that you can start with the adversary ( book 3 ) if you want . 
   so many resets and retcons, 
  the realms have * always * changed to fit with new editions . 
  but they 're not really retcons or hamfisted resets . 
  they try to write it in to the story . 
  when 4e simplified the cosmology , this was in part explained by asmodeus absorbing azuth 's divine spark , killing the former god of spells and making asmodeus a god . 
  he then threw the abyss down to the bottom of the elemental chaos . 
  the changes in magic were described by mystra 's death . 
  the changes * back * in 5e are described by mystra being reborn and azuth turning out not to be dead , but simply contained within asmodeus , and eventually getting free . 
  it 's all mechanical changes being used as fodder for good stories . 
   do i not get a new world map at all ? 
  unfortunately not . 
  the most up to date map of faer\u00fbn i know of is [ this one ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/a/a0/faerun_map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080923050218 ) from 1479 dr. 
  the current year is apparently around 1491 dr. 
  there have been some major changes , such as the fissures closing up and the sea of fallen stars filling back up . 
  if you enter that it very briefly goes to 3 % and then says `` fail '' . 
  yeah i find that really strange . 
  i would have expected a swing towards qut around that time , since that 's roughly when the 18c case started , which i would have thought would increase interest in qut on google . 
  i ca n't think of anything that would make uq searches increase . 
  was the ninth drop around then ? 
  i thought it was earlier . 
  doing a non-region-personalised search ( using duck duck go , since google does n't let you do that ) , there is ** one ** result on the first page that * is n't * our qut , and even that is right near the bottom . 
  for uq , there are three results not about the university , all in the bottom 4 ( and one of those is still australian ) . 
  it 's * possible * that this traffic differential is related to something other than the australian universities , but i doubt it . 
  because wotc decided you should be able to run around your enemies in circles without provoking an opportunity attack ( while at the same time making it so that taking just a few steps backwards * does * provoke oa ) . 
  it 's dumb and unrealistic , and it makes flanking * way * too easy to get . 
  plus , `` advantage '' is an enormous bonus . 
  it massively increases your chances to hit , it cancels out limitless numbers of sources of disadvantage , and it nearly * doubles * your chances of a crit . 
  it 's unfortunate , but flanking as written in the dmg is too powerful to apply alongside the standard movement rules . 
  better would be to fix the movement rules so they make more sense and/or change flanking to a +2 or +1 static bonus , rather than advantage . 
  i imagine a psephologist 's job is much harder when voting is not compulsory , since not only do you have to figure out someone 's preference , but also whether they 're likely to turn out to vote . 
   nano is better than vim, 
  i would say `` them 's fighten ' words '' , but that kinda implies there 's a fight to be had . 
  but there is n't . 
  vim vs emacs is a fight . 
  nano vs vim or emacs is like a two year old armed with a pillow taking on an adult man armed with a rifle . 
   sailuhn, 
  is that meant to be pronounced \uc0c8\ub8ec ? 
  i 'm just curious . 
   helpfulest, 
  unfortunately not a word . 
  english is a lot less agglutinative than deutsch . 
  my system for naming things is usually to think of something that they represent , and try a whole bunch of different translations to a bunch of different languages .
