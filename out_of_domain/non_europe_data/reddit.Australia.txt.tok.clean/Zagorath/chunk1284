  then tweak them a little to make them sound better as a place name . 
  i wish , in retrospect , that i had kept track of where all my names came from . 
  unfortunately because i usually tweak them a little i ca n't remember specific examples and using google translate does n't help remind me . 
  but as an example , my two main continents are named `` itaan '' and `` l\u00e4nsi '' , which comes from i believe finnish , meaning `` west '' and `` east '' , respectively . 
  the small town on the frontier that i had my campaign start was named `` este '' , meaning `` barrier '' , also finnish . 
  ( i find finnish to be a good choice frequently , because tolkien 's quenya was based on it , so it naturally sounds quite fantastical to us . ), 
  i have a large mountain range called `` rachis '' , which i got after seeing the frisian word for `` spine '' , which is `` r\u00each '' . 
  i basically take the word i want it to mean , go through all the different options for every language in google translate , and see which ones i like -- which ones sound like they fit within the names that i 've already created . 
  i try a bunch of different base words to see what comes out . 
  for example a river might be based on the word `` river '' , but it might also be `` lifebringer '' or `` rapid '' or some synonym of one of those . 
  i also sometimes , but not always , try to stick to a certain naming convention . 
  for example , i have one kingdom where all the cities are named `` ars \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ '' , and all the villages are `` arsa \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ '' . 
  sorta the same way that dragonborn cities in faer\u00fbn are all `` djerad \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ \\ _ '' ( djerad thymar , djerad kethendi , etc. ) . 
  i use much the same technique with gods ' names . 
  my god of the road , merchants , and communication is named `` nuntius '' , from latin for `` message '' . 
  that 's just my technique . 
  it 's certainly not the only one , but i find it works quite nicely . 
  i do n't limit myself to just one other language , but i do try and make them `` feel '' subjectively to me as though they belong in the same world , especially if they 're meant to be part of the same culture in my world . 
  coming up with good names is , i find , one of the hardest parts of worldbuilding , and i hate when i have to come up with something on-the-spot . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's the best definition you could use . 
  that 's certainly a part of psephology , but psephology is broader than that . 
  psephologists are concerned , broadly , with the study of elections . 
  that includes how people vote , but also things like voting * systems * , electoral rules , and the like . 
  side note , i was amazed to find out that psephology has a wikipedia philosophy score of \u221e . 
  it gets back to `` knowledge '' of all things , but somehow * still * goes in an infinite loop rather than making it back to philosophy . 
   we used to have knights as well , then tony abbot ruined that for everyone, 
  huh ? 
  abbott was the one that brought them * back * after they were abolished in 1986 by bob hawke . 
  turnbull removed them again when he got the prime ministership . 
   my party ended up killing a balor with a 5 man team , at level 7, 
  i help mitigate this problem by having flanking * definitely * not work against huge creatures , and i go back and forth on whether it should work on large creatures . 
  leaning towards `` no '' at the moment . 
  oh , right . 
  you were using the actual korean word for `` new '' . 
  i did n't realise !, 
  yeah , transliterations of korean are honestly just awful all across the board . 
  definitely not your fault :p, 
  you * could * work in some swedish jokes , but it 's worth noting that finnish is an entirely different family of languages . 
  swedish has more in common with spanish or hindi than finnish in its origin . 
  swedish is germanic , which is part of the indo-european family of languages , just like the romance languages are . 
  finnish is uralic , derived from an entirely different proto language . 
  but yeah , if you 're interested , quenya is largely inspired by finnish , sindarin by welsh , khuzdul by hebrew , and the mannish languages by old english and old norse . 
   the level below it is open to a few hundred people, 
  there are 35 companionships of the order of australia awarded each year . 
  140 officers , and 340 memberships . 
  today , only ( the very pleasing number of ) 512 companions of the order of australia are registered . 
  a very small amount more than that resigned from the order or had their award cancelled , or choose not to appear in the database . 
  less than 530 have * ever * been awarded . 
  i 'm a little confused . 
  i thought kingdom hearts 3 came out ** years ** ago . 
  i ca n't remember exactly when , but i 'm sure i remember it being some time between 2010 and 2015 . 
  was that just when they first announced they would be making it or something ? 
  i 'll admit i have n't followed it closely . 
  this is a bot that never needed to be made . 
  the other guy said 7 pm cet , which google says is 6 pm utc . 
  so i 'm now more confused than i was at the start . 
  which is it ? 
  or is it neither ? 
  both ? 
  yeah i would love to listen to an audiobook version . 
  i 'm just never going to read this book in any other form . 
  whether matt narrates it himself or someone else does does n't really matter to me . 
  matt did a great job with that extract , but many other books i 've listened to also have great narrators . 
  does anyone know how audible frontiers works ? 
  maybe they could front some of the cost of producing the thing , if matt is n't willing to do it all himself ? 
  actually more often it 's a family member or friend of the family . 
  normally , yes , but audible frontiers is their own in-house production team that i 'm pretty sure exists to produce audiobooks of science fiction and fantasy novels that otherwise would n't get them . 
  i do n't know if it 's possible to * ask * to work with them ( or if they only pick books themselves ) , or how you do of it is possible . 
  i was merely throwing it out there as a suggestion . 
  this is awesome !, 
  i 've tried playing aoe1 recently with friends , and it 's just unplayable . 
  the netcode in the original game just grinds to a holt if there are more than a couple dozen units . 
  i 'd absolutely love a more polished version of the game . 
  i hope they do n't call it age of empires 4 unless it continues the trend of moving forward in time . 
  a late victorian and edwardian era game would he difficult to pull off , but if the team were the same as the one that made age 3 , i 'd trust them to do it . 
  alternatively , if they revisit a different time period , that 'd be awesome too . 
  just needs a different name . 
  why ? 
  steam is a shitty platform whose only real redeeming quality is the enormous range of games it has . 
  why would you * not * want to support some competition to it . 
   it would be good if steam got some actual competition so valve actually starts caring about it 's platform, 
  hear , hear . 
  steam is a fucking terrible platform with ** one ** redeeming quality -- ubiquity . 
  nearly every game you want is sold through steam , and alternative stores only sell you a steam key anyway . 
  it desperately needs some competition , so i 'm more than happy to support any attempt at providing it . 
  especially from a game i 'm as hyped for as this . 
  you ever hear about toy story 2 ? 
  literally any site that does n't make me sign up for a video game streaming website to use it . 
   the rest are like annoying resource sucking ticks that i have to remember to close, 
  well good news . 
  the windows store is just a * store * . 
  once you 've downloaded a game through it , it functions the same as if you installed a game from cd back before all these digital tools . 
  the asian expansion was pretty terrible . 
  plus , at the same time as the expansion came out , the base game had some `` balance '' patches which fundamentally misunderstood the point of the game 's design & nbsp ; & mdash ; & nbsp ; giving each faction additional units that filled in a deliberate design space which that faction was not * meant * to have for balance and gameplay differentiating reasons . 
  for example , they gave the greeks access to healing units , despite that being one of their main weaknesses compared to other civs , and giving the norse an archer . 
  personally , i 've hardly played it since the expansion came out for these reasons . 
  but the base aom ee worked perfectly for me , and i never had any problems . 
  age 1 never supported mac or linux anyway . 
  age 3 supported mac fully and even though it 's on steam now , it 's no longer supported on macos . 
  aom had mac supported but its expansion did n't , and it 's also not available today despite the game being on steam .
