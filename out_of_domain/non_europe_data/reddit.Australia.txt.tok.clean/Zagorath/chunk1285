  why would age 1 be any different , especially considering it has ** never ** been available to them . 
  do n't be silly , of course he makes them . 
  if you buy a tinfoil hat it might come with pre-installed holes for the man to get through to him . 
  if aoe :o counts , then so should aom , which would make the next one vi . 
  i agree , but i kinda hope they do n't call it `` age of empires 4 '' unless it 's victorian/edwardian , or maybe more recent than that . 
  the main age series should continue moving forward in the timeline . 
  i think it 'd be a hard game to do well , but if they had a team like the old ensemble studios did ( and they 've recently hired two of the old leads of that team ) , i 'd trust them to get it done . 
  that said , i 'd also be super happy with another ancient , medieval , renaissance , or fantasy ( aom 2 !! ), 
  game made with more modern technology . 
  an ancient or medieval game especially , since age 1 and 2 use such an old engine . 
  i 'd probably play the shit out of it whatever they do , but i hope if it 's revisiting an older era they find some other subtitle to use . 
  none of them are ** ever ** up in australia . 
  oh wow , myke looks * nothing * like how i imagined him . 
  should * have * and could * have * . 
  or alternatively , should * 've * and could * 've * . 
  do you have an xbox account ? 
  i did n't , so i had to make one . 
  once i had made it , it still failed , so i went into the account and changed some stuff around ( mainly giving myself a `` gamer tag '' that was n't the default one they gave me ) . 
  then i was able to successfully sign up . 
  i thought aom was absolutely fine , until the expansion came out . 
  the changes they made for `` balance '' , even to the base game , were terrible , and of course the chinese themselves are regarded as poorly designed . 
  they 're release a version of the original age of empires that 's somewhere between a remaster and a complete remake . 
  graphics that seem to be quasi-3d instead of the clumsy 2d sprites of the original , adding features like an idle villager button and control groups , a soundtrack re-made by a symphony orchestra , updated pathfinding , etc. 
  but still the same basic game as the original . 
  gameplay should be essentially the same , with minor tweaks on top to make it better . 
  you should watch the announcement stream . 
  it seems like they 're making a lot of gameplay changes that , while keeping the fundamental gameplay experience the same , will make it much more playable . 
  better pathfinding , idle villager buttons , etc. 
  they have n't ( to my knowledge ) announced a complete list of all the changes , but it sounds like it may end up being at least as playable as , if not more than , age 2 . 
  well , the one linked further down this thread is a pretty good start . 
  i asked my phone ( google assistant ) and the result was an / r/copypasta thread ... specifically , [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5za1sj/can_cats_eat_pancakes ) . 
  she read out the paragraph starting with `` in short '' . 
  and you 're making the huge assumption that it never happened because of wow . 
  warcraft 4 never happened mainly because the rts format died out . 
  there has n't been a really big , really good rts since age 3 , which came out only two years after the warcraft 3 expansion . 
  the rts playerbase has sadly diminished , with competitive gamers turning to mobas and casual ones to clash of clans clones , and very few studios can justify making high budget ones like they used to be able to . 
  that is not so for rpgs . 
   they 're not, 
  whoa now . 
  that 's a pretty damn huge philosophical claim to make , buddy . 
  we ca n't even be sure * people * have free will , let alone spiders . 
  i 'm not even an afl fan and i can tell you 're deluded . 
   but wait ; they 're not as bad as the liberals , you should vote for them anyways ; there 's no point in disengaging from the system, 
  you said that as a parody , to demonstrate why it 's wrong . 
  but it 's not . 
  it 's just fucking not . 
  and you 're deluding yourself if you think it is . 
  yes , they might be just as bad as the lnp * on this one issue * . 
  but it 's not the only issue in politics . 
  labor believes climate change is a real thing that threatens the planet . 
  they believe in the importance of an independent and well-funded abc . 
  they support quality public education and hospitals . 
  marriage equality . 
  taxation types and rates . 
  employees ' rights . 
  the number of issues on which labor is better than the lnp is immense . 
  just because they 're equally bad in ** one ** way does not negate all the good they do elsewhere . 
  yes , there are even better parties out there . 
  pirate party and greens spring to mind . 
  but since you 're going to have to preference one of them above the other eventually in 99 % of cases , this `` they 're both equally bad '' narrative is some dangerous bullshit . 
  the fbi does not have legislation backing them up . 
  if labor and the lnp pass something like this through parliament , asio will . 
  and if apple wants to keep selling products in australia , they 'll * have * to comply , no matter how terrible the law may be . 
  the point is that if free will does not exist , then they essentially * are * ( as are we ) simple input/output machines . 
  even if they ( and we ) do n't know it . 
  i was mostly just making a joke tbh . 
  nothing to take too seriously . 
  the method i advocate is a mediated version of method i. 
  do method i as described there ( and as is the default method in 5e 's phb ) . 
  then , count out your total ability score modifier for all abilities combined . 
  if it 's above +5 , you reroll . 
  if it 's below +2 , you reroll . 
  this gets you the best of both rolling and of point buy . 
  the randomness in terms of distribution ( can get anywhere from 3 to 18 , might get a very glass canon range or a jack of all trades , or anywhere in between those extremes ) of rolling , but the balance of point buy ( since everyone is given roughly the same total power level . 
  nl as in netherlands ? 
  if so no duh , you guys speak english better than many native speakers . 
  not quite , but you can make it do it when you type `` r & nbsp ; # '' , with a space . 
  simply create a custom search engine ( under `` manage search engines '' in settings ) , with the key word being `` r '' and the url being https://www.reddit.com/r/%s, 
  give it whatever name you want , i use `` subreddit '' , and then use it just by typing r and a space , and then the name of the subreddit . 
  source : google +, 
  also google wave , may it rest in piece . 
  born in australia to white aussie parents , but i moved to korea aged 10 , and to vietnam aged 13 . 
  stayed there until i finished high school ( ib ) before coming back here . 
  definitely feel a little odd when seeing some aussie customs , but i 've mostly gotten used to it . 
  after my first overseas after moving back to aus , the return truly did n't really feel to me like i was coming home . 
  but i 've mostly gotten over that now and i can comfortably say i feel mostly at home here . 
  what 's your story ? 
  the same thing that makes gold or fiat currencies valuable . 
  people believe it is . 
  gold has very little inherent value . 
  you can use it in some specific electronics applications , and you can make jewellery out of it , but even that latter application is mostly due to perceived value . 
  and fiat currencies have absolutely ** zero ** value except that people believe it does . 
  people accept was is essentially a piece of copper/nickel alloy , polymer , or a bunch of digital bits , as payment in exchange for their own work , because they believe that other people will accept those same coins/banknotes/electronic payments in exchange for the stuff they want to buy , like food . 
  that 's sick cunt . 
  the voice is crazy and over the top , but that feels like part of the charm of it to me . 
  like it 's being deliberately stupid , so people do n't take it too seriously . 
  at least that 's how i view it . 
  my only bits of feedback, 
  * the term `` juke '' gets thrown out a couple of times without actually explaining what it means . 
  it took me ages to work it out when i was starting out , and even that mostly just from context .
