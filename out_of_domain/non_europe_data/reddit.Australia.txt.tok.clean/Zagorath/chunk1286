  * team tiles do n't work for the fc . 
  * the clip used to demonstrate a rolling bomb ... does n't . 
  like , nobody was close enough to boss to be thrown back by it . 
  i also hate it , but i kinda think that 's the * point * . 
  it 's so stupidly over-the-top intense that it can only be a satire . 
  the mystic is * stupidly * overpowered . 
  i had one in my game and it quickly became a running joke that any time the players were wondering if they could do something , the answer would be `` yeah , tim can do it , he just has to spend a power point or something '' . 
  and most of the time they were right . 
  absolutely * destroys * in social situations . 
  able to move at * crazy * speeds , faster than our monk , and keep it up for a surprisingly long amount of time . 
  gains 5 temp hp ** every round ** , which means in normal circumstances he 's taking less actual damage than a barbarian . 
  dpr that keeps up with most other classes , even if it does n't surpass them . 
  and all that , without anyone even being able to know that he 's doing * anything * , because it 's an automatic subtle spell . 
   but never gains access to anything more powerful than level 5 spells, 
  oh great . 
  so they 're stupidly overpowered until the party reaches level 11 , then ? 
  i rarely go over that , and neither do the published adventures ( i think & mdash ; i 'll admit i 've not looked too closely at them ) . 
  so that 's not super helpful . 
  which is even * more * reason that penalties should be harsher for the driver . 
  it 's pretty obvious , really . 
  pretty much the same amount of protection , but much higher speeds . 
  so where are people * supposed * to cycle , then ? 
  in most states cyclists are n't allowed on the footpath over a certain age . 
  and now you 're proposing they should n't be on the road either ? 
  that 's stupid . 
  more states should adopt queensland 's laws for cyclists . 
  let the bike rider choose which is safer based on their own preference and the context of the specific location . 
  either footpath or road . 
  yes, 
  that 's an easy choice . 
  it 's like saying `` get shot it the foot every morning . 
  have broccoli taste like chocolate . 
  pick one . '', 
   i see so many cars in peak hour traffic with a single occupant !, 
  like really dude , you need to take up all that space and slow everyone else down, 
  t3 lanes really should be far more ubiquitous . 
  i do n't know how much research you 've done , but if you have n't already , it might also be worth looking at flights that leave from the gold coast instead of brisbane . 
  air asia can often be a super cheap airline . 
  dunno if it 'll be cheaper than jetstar or not , but it 's worth looking at if you have n't already . 
  the only thing that impressed me at the whole thing was the age of empires definitive edition . 
  somewhere between a remaster ( like age 2 and age of mythology got ) and a complete remake . 
  i am ** so ** hyped for this to come out . 
  give me a pianist who does n't sing . 
  if i wanted a singer i 'd pick a choral arrangement . 
  [ this is a much better performance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovsmpdxuas ) . 
  both for the lack of singing and for the interpretation , imo . 
  it 's also better audio quality , which is doubly good . 
  true , but the oc seemed mostly concerned with price . 
  of course , all things being equal , you really should avoid kla . 
  it 's a fucking terrible place to transfer , with their bullshit security theatre . 
  fair enough . 
  still coulda used a better clip for the rb though . 
  i wish the game supported , aoe for us dvorak master racers . 
  i do n't know how it works , but could n't they show something else -- * anything * else -- that they already have the rights to ? 
  old simpsons re-runs , even some reality tv crap would at least allow them to diversify their broadcast . 
  i would no joke pay to have neighbours removed from my tv . 
  i do n't really see why . 
  they are n't -- and never * have * been -- only about news and current affairs programming . 
  they 've got plenty of narrative fiction shows . 
  not sure why neighbours would be any different , even if you or i have no intention of ever watching it . 
  til 10 is marketed towards my age range . 
  like most , i do n't watch tv , but on the rare occasions i do , abc is the most likely , followed by 9 ( mostly for the nrl -- and mainly only origin , at that ) and sbs ( for le tour ) . 
  7 and 10 just never even occur to me to watch . 
  did n't one of those shows get cancelled ? 
  it 's a vastly inferior form of cricket to test , but i 've actually kinda come around to it a little over time . 
  it fills the same sort of role as afl and nrl , as a game you can watch in the evening as some light entertainment . 
  it 's not deep or complex , and it 's hard to really get in to in a serious way , but it 's a decent dumb distraction . 
  meanwhile , one day games lack both the depth of test and the pace of 20/20 . 
  outside of the world cup , i honestly do n't think there 's any point to odis anymore at all . 
  right . 
  which means if he takes a total of 10 or less damage in a round , he 's absorbing more than a barbarian would . 
  til 10 has star trek . 
  i 've been going through that recently on netflix . 
  that 's utterly insignificant compared to the protection the body of a car offers . 
  we 're comparing both in relation to cars , do n't be obtuse . 
  is it ? 
  i 've never heard it used outside of this game . 
  i ca n't even think of any other video games where it makes sense as a term . 
  and in sports , the closest term i can think of is `` sidestep '' , which is also an expression that 's made its way into more common vocabulary . 
  haha i have to be honest , i loved the ib programme . 
  it was a lot of work and incredibly stressful at the time , but so rewarding . 
  what were your subjects , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  definitely vietnam for me . 
  my parents still live there , and i 've been back every christmas since i left . 
  i 'm also still in touch with some of the people i knew from then . 
  that 's not really true for me with korea . 
  being both more recent and a longer amount of time probably also helps . 
  i did learn more of the language there than i did in vietnam , though . 
  ( still not much , but more . ), 
  what about you ? 
  where would you say you feel more at home ? 
  i felt like kinda an arsehole with that last comment , but i could n't help myself . 
  the symmetry was just too appealing . 
  i 've seen some suggestion that it might be on xbox , but i 'm not sure if that 's true , or if so , how it would work . 
  oh wow , thanks !, 
  glad i could help . 
  dammit guys , all that talk about rsis has made me afraid to sit at my computer and use it . 
  and i do n't even have any signs of rsis ... 
  watch your language . 
  that sort of slur is not acceptable on this forum .
