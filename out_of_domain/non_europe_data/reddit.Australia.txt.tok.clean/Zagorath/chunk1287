  you 've been warned about your attitude before , / u/lukemortora01 . 
  if you ca n't take criticism in stride , you should n't be sharing your material . 
  if someone is being rude to you , it is ** not ** acceptable to react in kind . 
  just do n't respond , or remain polite and matter-of-fact in your responses . 
  i think this is quite well made . 
  i would rate the asis 3.25 , for synergy . 
  speed is worth an extra 0.5, 
  darkvision is worth 0.5, 
  proficiency in perception is 0.5, 
  olfactory superiority i would rate 0.5 . 
  it 's quite circumstantial , but not quite rare enough to be 0.25 . 
  wasteland scavenger is the same . 
  savage combatant , being only 1d4 , is 0.25 . 
  jaws of death is a natural weapon and 1d6 , so 0.5 . 
  but i 'd also impose a -0.25 penalty for the anti-synergy between the claws and the jaws . 
  i am assuming here that the bonus action will be removed , since the comments further down the thread seem to imply it will be . 
  if it * is n't * removed , i 'd rate this ability at 1 , and remove the anti-synergy penalty . 
  imposed etic is probably worth about 0.75 , i 'd say . 
  the disadvantage is worth a small penalty , but the advantage is a huge buff . 
  that 's a total score of 7.0 . 
  i do think it 's a little on the strong side , but not a whole lot . 
  7.75 if the bonus action jaws attack is kept , which ** is ** well overpowered . 
  the only feedback i would suggest to / u/lukemortora01 is that the ability to use dex with attacks seems to be a poor fit both for flavour reasons ( werewolves do n't use dex , why should a werewolf-like race do so ) , and for mechanical reasons ( it definitely is a buff to the race , however small that may be , and more importantly it 's a buff to the dex stat , which is already insanely powerful ) . 
  using the [ detect balance scale ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) for most of these numbers . 
  all points have been divided by 4 to keep to the original and superior method of an asi being worth +1 . 
  i also do n't think darkvision is worth as much as that scale rates it . 
  i gave a mechanic judgement in response to a comment further down the thread . 
  but i just wan na say i really like the flavour . 
  it reminds me a little of the [ vryloka ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) , in the sense that this is a race designed to achieve some of the same flavour as a lycanthrope , without actually * being * a lycanthrope and taking on all the baggage that that would necessarily need to have , just as the vryloka does for vampires . 
  nice job there . 
  the biggest criticism i have in terms of flavour is at the very beginning . 
  races traditionally begin with a quote . 
  it can be something from an actual book you 've read ( most in the phb use actual d&d novels ) , a video game you 've played ( i used a skyrim quote for the vryloka ) , or something you made up yourself . 
  the main point is that it should feel like words spoken by or about your race from the perspective of people in a fantasy universe . 
  i think the tiefling entry in the phb does an especially good job of demonstrating how this can be used effectively to give the reader a real sense of the race 's place in the world . 
   i wonder why no company has ever tried to seriously compete with them, 
  finale * tries * , but their programme is so poorly designed from a ux perspective i do n't think they really have any chance . 
  dorico has been out for nearly a year now , and it was made by a lot of the same people who were on the sibelius team before avid decided to fire them all and hire cheaper labour elsewhere . 
  by all accounts , dorico is supposed to be just a strictly * better * version of sibelius . 
  though i have n't had the chance to use it yet myself . 
  why is beethoven reacting at all ? 
  he 's clearly facing away from mahler , so for all he knows , mahler might not even be there . 
  i do n't understand the premise of the joke at all , but that 's not what my comment there was about . 
  that was just a `` beethoven is deaf '' joke . 
  [ here is another spyro graph . 
  yeah i find the concept of a sword as a patron really quite jarring . 
  it does n't feel like it makes as much sense as all the other patrons they 've come out with . 
  the mechanics are n't a problem . 
  just make the patron something otherworldly , not a damn stick of metal with a mind . 
  is ie mer - related to english mermaid ? 
  i would think that if everyone at the table was in to it ( not the case in this op , but surely * could * be the case in other situations ) , it would be quite a step up . 
  personally if a being were trapped in something else , i would just have the patron be whatever that being was . 
  devil trapped in a book ? 
  fey trapped in a sword ? 
  a god trapped in a crystal gem ? 
  i do n't know how you 've done it , but somehow the hyphen character here : ' 2017\u20102018 ' is n't a normal hyphen-minus character , like the one seen here ' 2018 - second ' ( try it : ctrl-f ' - ' , the first does n't show up ) . 
  apparently the page bot does n't like unicode . 
  and once it saw that message , it was unable to move past it . 
  anyway , working on a fix , but in the mean time , i 've manually marked that message as read , and if you just avoid any non-ascii characters ( anything that can be typed with a normal us keyboard is safe , as well as a few other characters ) until i can get it fixed , it should be fine . 
  it should be working properly now , unicode and all . 
  electric fences are n't usually disguised . 
  they have signs up on them all over the place saying ( something to the effect of ) `` warning : electrified fence '' , as well as the somewhat more subtle but nonetheless noticeable little [ `` bobbers '' ] ( https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/cimg/www.doityourself.com/660x300_100-1/241/electric-fence-146241.jpg ) ( i have no idea what they 're properly called ) , and the fact that they make a light buzzing noise . 
  i 'm just really hoping android o is called `` orange '' . 
  then we 'll be comparing apples to oranges . 
  not likely to happen since oranges are n't really a dessert , but a guy can hope . 
  it 's good enough at this point that you * can * use it , but it still feels a lot more clumsy than windows or macos . 
  it all works , it 's just not as polished . 
  yeah , i think people are misunderstanding the etymology of the ranger 's class name . 
  it 's easy to see `` ranger '' and think it 's intended to be used to make ranged attacks . 
  it 's an easy assumption to make , but a wrong one . 
  rangers are named for the * verb * `` to range '' , meaning `` to travel over ( an area , etc ) ; to roam , wander '' . 
  of course , they frequently * do * use ranged weapons . 
  [ the image of faramir with a longbow is a striking one ] ( http://www.gryphonsmith.com/fileg/toronto/gondor/fshoot1.jpg ) ( even if he 's really more of an outlander fighter/rogue than a d&d ranger ) . 
  so that ca n't help with the common misconception . 
  i 'd say and\u00faril is really more of a longsword than a greatsword . 
  plus , aragorn only gets and\u00faril after at the council of elrond ( and even later in the movies ) , which is the point at which he starts to transition from * strider the ranger * to * aragorn , son of arathorn , called elessar the elfstone , dunadan ; the heir of isildur elendil 's son of gondor * . 
  while he is a ranger , he is * also * a king . 
  and tolkien makes these two aspects of aragorn very clearly delineated . 
  the latter is the one most associated with and\u00faril . 
  of course not at the same time !, 
  got ta use a bonus action to switch !, 
  people are rating the mystic well , apparently . 
  i do n't know who these people are , because it 's completely apparent to anyone with a sense of balance and who has seen the thing in play : the mystic is broken . 
  just stupidly strong . 
  i can only assume most of the ratings are from munchkins who * want * to be allowed to build broken characters , are maybe from na\u00efve people who read it and liked it , without seeing it in practice . 
  i know that i liked it before i saw it in practice . 
  well , liked most of the mechanics , anyway . 
  hated the flavour . 
  they 've destroyed it from a flavour perspective . 
  kubuntu is the main flavour of linux i use , and it 's the thing i was thinking of most when i made that last comment . 
   writing in the margines , and waterdamage, 
  rounded corners are just a sign of general wear . 
  but i ca n't even * imagine * wanting to * write * in the margins of my book -- or anywhere else , for that matter . 
  that 's ** blasphemy ** . 
  i also would be terrified of my books getting significantly damaged by water . 
   a central application that updates literally every single one of my programs, 
  both windows an macos have something that aims to replicate this . 
  for basic users , it 's probably enough , although admittedly not for advanced users like you 're likely to find on here . 
  most applications these days are turning towards an automatic update model anyway , so that 's becoming less and less relevant over time . 
   i do n't have to periodically run a malware scan .
