  i do n't have to rely on third party drivers of dubious quality, 
  true on windows . 
  but macos is just as good as linux in this regard . 
   gimp is good enough for everything, 
  gimp is fucking horrible . 
  a novice user can figure out more or less how to use photoshop with some basic common sense . 
  i have never been able to figure out how the fuck to do even the most basic stuff in gimp . 
   vim and emacs are both better ides than visual studio, 
  i do n't know about emacs , since i 'm a vim user myself . 
  i also do n't know about visual studio , since most of my programming is java , python , and php , not c # . 
  but vim definitely is ** not ** a proper replacement for a good ide , with built in code completion , complex reformatting , syntax error detection , debugging capabilities , and more , all available really easily . 
  vim is lovely for when you need to do something via command line , and it 's even my editor of choice for * anything * where i do n't feel the need of those more advanced editing features of an ide ( for example , most of my smaller python scripts ) . 
  but for working on a large complex problem with many classes , some of which i might not understand in detail , an ide is vastly superior . 
  but all that is actually completely moot , because that 's not what i was talking about . 
  i was talking about the spit and polish of the operating system . 
  the way its window manager works , its task bar , its gui responsiveness . 
  little things like that which make an operating system feel nice to use . 
  linux is behind a long way on that front , still . 
  i spent * hours * trying to figure out how to get kubuntu to replicate the feature that is built in to windows out of the box , where you press the windows key and a number , and it opens the corresponding application from your task bar . 
  i ** never ** managed to get that working . 
  i spent hours getting it so that pressing just the windows key would open the equivalent of the start menu & mdash ; i * did * succeed eventually , but it was a mighty challenge . 
  the little peak thing you get when you hover over an application 's icon in the taskbar does n't work properly & mdash ; it 's there in some form , but it behaves in unintuitive ways that are so bizarre i do n't really even know how to explain it . 
  the keyboard shortcuts for maximising , restoring , or pinning windows to the left or right are simple and intuitive on windows , not so in kde ( if indeed they even exist out of the box ) . 
  similarly , it works really nicely with the mouse by dragging to the top or an edge . 
  macos does things a little differently , with its one dimensional approach and emphasis on full-screen applications , switched between using keyboard shortcuts or trackpad gestures . 
  it 's different , but also a real pleasure to work with in a way kde is not . 
  i 'm sure many of my concerns are addressed in other flavours of linux , but they all have their own alternative problems . 
  i shopped around a lot before deciding that kubuntu provided the best combination of out-of-the-box experience and satisfying customisability to approach how i want to use a computer . 
  in case you do n't also know these : windows-up and windows-down cycle between maximised , restored , and minimised , in a pretty intuitive way . 
  windows-left and right move windows between the left half of the screen , restored , and the right half of the screen . 
  win-left and right can also be used to move across multiple screens . 
  we 're most likely to get eberron or dark sun . 
  i very much doubt wizards will be revisiting dragonlance or greyhawk ( except possibly if a third party is doing all the work ) any time soon . 
  they offer very little that is n't already available through the forgotten realms . 
  one generic high fantasy setting is more or less substitutable for another . 
  eberron and dark sun each bring something particularly interesting and unique to the table , which makes them worth doing . 
  yeah it 's seriously fucking annoying . 
  a lot of subreddits have this `` np links only '' automod rule , and it 's bullshit . 
  90 % of the most sensible removed are ones like this , where brigading clearly is not an issue to begin with . 
  sure , brigading is a bad thing and should he avoided , but np links alhardly do anything to stop it anyway . 
  all they do is pop up a little reminder to please not brigade . 
  my sister is in medicine now . 
  she took biology and chemistry hl , but the rest of her subjects based on personal interest or what was easy . 
  that included maths sl , because maths is n't needed for medicine . 
  a high total score ( 40 + ) was important , so doing the harder maths would have been kinda shooting yourself in the foot . 
  i think it 'd be an absurd university that * would * require it . 
  that said , some might want it , so look at the particular uni . 
  as for the english thing , what the hell sort of ib school are you going to that does n't offer english a ? 
  my school was in vietnam and offers both english a literature and lang/lit . 
  at a younger age i was in korea and they also offer at least one of those . 
  they mechanically perform very well in a number of areas , and their flavour would he really fucking great if you removed the ~ 60 % of the spell list that does n't match it , and removed magical secrets . 
   justice le miere criticised their submissions , describing them as `` gobbledegook '' and saying they ranged from `` the merely irrelevant to the bizarre '' . 
  pfft , that 's brilliant . 
  anyway , what are their chances of a higher court accepting their appeal ? 
  got ta be near none , surely ? 
   i tried it, 
  there . 
  that 's all the evidence you need . 
  you did it . 
  you declared yourself sovereign . 
  i 'm just sad for you that your wife is supporting a now foreign nation rather than you . 
  must be lonely at the top . 
  how do you get that ? 
  at high levels you have a 3/20 chance per attach of a crit . 
  so 17/20 chance of a not crit . 
  if you 're making 10 attacks , that 's ( 17/20 ) ^ 10 chance of no crits , or roughly 20 % of the time , you wo n't crit . 
  at least one crit 80 % of the time . 
  oh right . 
  of course . 
  that makes sense . 
  local [ . host ] ( https://icannwiki.org/.host ) ? 
  the guys running the . host tld seem to say it 's only for hosting service providers to use , but i do n't think there 's any rules saying they * have * to follow that . 
  this was actually the penultimate episode . 
  for some reason they decided to put this one * before * `` van of the year '' . 
  maybe it was planned that way , but that 's not what ended up happening . 
  from my memory , the only changes the swashbuckler had was tightening up the wording surrounding its main ability ( changing some weird edge cases a little , but nothing major ) , and renaming the same . 
  and the storm sorcerer only lost its bonus spells . 
  doubtless many of the other things they publish * will * have significant changes , but i 'm not sure the waterborne adventures stuff is a great place to look for an example . 
  i 'm just about off to bed , so i wo n't be as verbose as i 'd like . 
  i 'm here mainly for reasons 1 and 2 , and to a lesser extent 4 . 
  in very rare occasions because of 6 . 
  good , civil discourse is important , even when people disagree . 
   the entirety of tolkien 's collections, 
  the lord of the rings and the hobbit along have 828045 * words * . 
  multiply by 5 for characters ( probably more in reality , considering the proper nouns in his world ) and that 's over 4.1 million characters . 
  that 's nearly 4 mb . 
  never mind the silmarillion , children of h\u00farin , unfinished tales , etc. , and the weirder things you might not even think of , like the published letters , his translation of beowulf , and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mr._bliss ) . 
  that 's really quite a substantial effort you 've gone to there . 
  especially seeing as even a really good and long future proofed back end security is going to be crunching it down to , at * best * , a kilobyte of data ( and more likely 256 bytes today ) . 
  the password into a hash . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` subclass '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
   his tv is a bit bland, 
  oy you . 
  i wo n't hear a bad word said about gruen . 
  we 've reached the singularity . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but depending on how this is implemented , could n't it actually be secure ? 
  i do n't know how those passwords it 's spitting out are generated , but if it 's a matter of a salted hash being used as the index for a lookup table of stupid-looking passwords , is n't that effectively the same level of security as just a salted hash ? 
  only with a dumb unhelpful ( but also unharmful ) level of obscurity on top ? 
  what does having gravity do ? 
  they do n't `` give away '' your information .
