  that notion does n't even make sense !, 
  their value proposition is that they have access to people and information about those people that no one else does . 
  if they gave that away to anyone with a couple of bucks the value would go way down . 
  they sell ads on the basis of the information they have , but the information itself is never available to the advertiser . 
  the advertiser says `` i want males 18 -- 25 living in maine with an interest in technology to see my ad for an electrical banana peeler '' , or whatever , and then google looks through their databases , finds males in the age range of 18 -- 25 , who are in maine , and who seem to have am interested in technology , and it takes the ad that the advertiser gave to them , and it displays it on sites visited by those users . 
  i 'm simplifying , of course -- ignoring the ad auction process , and the relevance of the site users are on at the time -- but that 's the general idea . 
  advertisers never see your data or know who you are . 
  it means your privacy is not being intruded upon , because nobody except you and google has access to your stuff . 
  sorry , but this subreddit does not allow asking questions about the existence of other content as a top level submission . 
  you might want to try asking in the arcana forge megathread instead . 
  i 'm interested . 
  but your link is just taking me to the dm 's guild 's home page . 
  oh man , i really love this . 
  it 's not quite as good as [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfgxwx1mjs ) ( disregard the title , it 's not rag , it 's jazz ) in my opinion , but still very good . 
  my biggest criticism with this version is the beginning of the b section , around bars 23 -- 27 or so . 
  it felt very blocky and in your face , and lost the cool swingy feel , and lost the feeling of forward momentum . 
  i quite liked the fact that this followed the original piece almost exactly . 
  it is n't something you should always feel * required * to do , but in this case i think it worked quite nicely . 
  just like that other version i linked * did n't * follow too closely , but also worked nicely for doing that . 
  just an observation . 
  this essentially counts as a `` request '' , so it 's violating rule 1 . 
  it 's both , 
  i 'm still not really seeing the difference . 
  i was half expecting it to cause you to fall to the ground like in the old easter chase events , but it seems to play just like a normal map . 
  ah right . 
  cheers . 
   implementing ui for this thing is a big task and not the most exciting one, 
  is it on github ? 
  somebody else might enjoy that aspect more than you and be willing to help . 
   ideally wards should n't be labeled explicitly at all , instead there should be labels for individual buildings - `` locksmith '' , `` mill '' , `` church '' etc. 
  is there a chance of this happening eventually in this generator ? 
   the next big thing i 'm going to work on though is rivers and coasts . 
  super excited for that !, 
  some things that you may or may not have already considered for when doing that ( probably have considered most of them , but i 'll list them anyway because they 're things i 'd like to see ) :, 
  * harbours/piers, 
  * islands ( both in the river and off the coast ), 
  * river * forks * , where the city is placed in and around the fork of the river, 
  * deltas, 
  it might be a good idea to put a formal copyright statement somewhere . 
  if all you want is credit , make it creative commons attribution ( cc-by ) . 
  just because an informal comment in response to one specific question on a forum might not have quite the same legal weight behind it as a clear and concise declaration that it 's cc . 
  another two , i think . 
  antshares seems to be a crypto currency too . 
  which is a shame . 
  i was hoping it was about people sharing the little bitey insects with each other . 
  i want to know why it knows what i 'll do on 17/06/2061 at around 3:00 am , and 06/11/2061 at around 5:50 am . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  i do n't know how it 's done in bali , but in korea dogs are literally whipped to death . 
  gets their adrenaline pumping apparently , improves the taste . 
  so no . 
  not equally bad . 
  not that i remember , and the apps used at that time do n't seem to include any games . 
  haha damn , beat me by 4 minutes . 
  yeah , it was a great sketch !, 
  as i 've come to expect from door monster . 
  it 's amazing how much things change , and yet stay the same . 
  although i would disagree with their assassin 's creed comments . 
  i 'd just say `` only play the first 4 game , and stop there '' . 
  oh , and because i know someone eventually is going to , [ here 's the xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/606/ ) . 
  it 's like a beautiful choreographed dance !, 
  i do n't know about any of the examples you 've given , but i * do * know that `` knife '' and `` knight '' once had their `` k '' pronounced at the beginning . 
  this is certainly an interesting experiment , but i think it really speaks to the fact that while reflavouring is a great powerful way to achieve a desired effect , it ** is n't ** always satisfactory . 
  there 's nothing in this that represents * any * of the traditional vampiric weaknesses , including ( as you mention ) the sunlight thing , but also , depending on someone 's preferred interpretation , running water , garlic , holy symbols , and the inability to cross a threshold without invitation . 
  not all of those are used in every vampire mythos , but certainly having a decent selection of them is important . 
  but that can all be added in through roleplay , so it 's not * necessarily * a huge problem . 
  a bigger problem is stuff that is purely mechanical . 
  for example , vampires are * undead * . 
  spells like * healing word * do n't work on them , but ones like * detect evil & good * do . 
  it also misses out on perhaps the biggest thing about vampires -- their insatiable lust for blood !, 
  you 've suggested a way that they can get a bite attack , but all it does is deal damage . 
  there 's no penalty for never using it . 
  nor any bonus gained by it . 
  finally , it 's missing a large number of the distinct abilities we think of vampires as having . 
  there 's no charm or mind control ability . 
  there 's no transforming ( e.g. 
  into mist or bats ) . 
  these are two of the core must fundamental features , and they 're nearly entirely missing . 
  you 've got a little charming of beasts , but vampires are * most * known for charming or making thralls out of * people * . 
  i do think that this is a really noble attempt at creating something . 
  and it does a surprisingly good job of it . 
  better than any i 've seen before . 
  but it still exposes the inherent limitations of reflavouring , and the reason that people who say `` there 's no need for new class options , anything you want can be achieving just by reflavouring existing stuff '' are straight up wrong . 
  if you really want to play a vampire , you need mechanics specifically designed to represent that . 
  [ there 's one really good vampire prestige class available here . 
  ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ), 
  beethoven has a beautiful funeral march [ in the second movement of his 3rd symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l_bpmjifv4 ) . 
  it 's absolutely beautiful and tragic . 
  i think some civ games have used it as the theme that plays when you wipe out another civ . 
  there 's of course the well-known [ funeral march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d05ab8xs7qa ) , by chopin . 
  ( or [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upupp1yuyhs ) , arranged for orchestra . ), 
  you could also use [ lament for haldir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkysqxpvjr8 ) , which plays over haldir 's death in the lord of the rings : the two towers . 
  [ elgar 's elegy for strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmiyoi_rue ) is another option , as is [ samuel barber 's * adagio for strings * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3mhent6yjs ) , which has been frequently called the `` saddest music ever created '' ( even if it 's been a little over-played recently , which might make it seem a little clich\u00e9d ) . 
  and a couple from everyone 's favourite space fantasy series , [ the funeral of qui-gon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nmw5zectpi ) and [ padm\u00e9 's funeral ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3kpemyl-oy ) , by the maestro himself , john williams . 
  [ anakin 's betrayal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrt-dieb3rs ) is also awfully sad music . 
  hope that helps !, 
  closer to the second one , but not permanent . 
  i like to listen to new stuff just for the sake of listening to it . 
  i enjoy it , even if i never actually download it and put it in my library or anything like that . 
  i normally like you , bot , but maybe do n't reply when there are 9 separate links in the comment ? 
  it ends up looking a bit obnoxious .
