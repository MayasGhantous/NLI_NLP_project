   i 'll just head over to the wikipedia page and see what happened to the plot, 
  actually , it 's because of the plot that i suggested stopping at revelations . 
  i feel like that 's the point where the creators went from having a vision for a coherent overarching story for the series , to purely using the franchise as a platform to make yearly generic games with just enough new mechanics and setting to keep people buying them . 
  it was after that point that they screwed over anyone interested in the overarching story of the series . 
  my dad once tried to make me practise with a broken finger . 
  admittedly he did n't know it was broken at the time , because i had only broken it minutes earlier . 
  but still . 
   ranger revised is al legal, 
  wait really ? 
  i 'll admit , i ** really ** do n't like al , for a bunch of reasons , but i 'm pleasantly surprised at this . 
  i went to google the date that the american bison went extinct , thinking it had to be even earlier than the european one , and i was surprised to see they 're actually * not * extinct , and are in fact doing really well !, 
  they went from 300 in 1900 to 360,000 today !, 
  they 're classified as `` near threatened '', 
  i thought that last paragraph was referring to the first one . 
  ** if ** this version * or a future revision of it * , gets published in a sourcebook , ** then ** players can select either the original ranger or the revised version . 
  unless they 've released a statement somewhere else specifically saying the revised ranger is al legal ( like they 've said will soon be the case for the mystic and artificer ) , i do n't think that text is sufficient . 
  correct , although both are very closely related . 
  both in the genus `` bison '' . 
  the american one is * bison bison * and the european one is * bison bonasus * . 
  unlike , say , the european and australian magpies , who only share an * order * . 
  to be fair , most of it is still the same , so your guide still mostly works for phb rangers . 
  reminds me of some deltora quest stuff . 
  i like it !, 
  it does n't get more australian than that guy right there . 
  i do n't even care if he 's never been to australia , he 's now officially become one . 
  yeah , the mountain dwarves with their two +2 s , half elves with their +2 and two +1 s , and `` standard '' humans with their six +1 s all get severely short changed by removing racial asis . 
  humans get * especially * fucked over by this . 
  which imo runs counter to the design intents of the game and most worlds in which people play . 
   evaluated at zero , or as the limit approaches zero, 
  at zero . 
  it does n't need to be a limit , because it has a well-defined value at zero . 
  and yes , d/dx would have made more sense than \u2202 / \u2202 x. 
  for the other points , some of the other replies have already got you well covered . 
  was expecting an animal to be hiding under there . 
  found an animal hiding under there . 
  not exactly unexpected ... 
   i want to eventually do al, 
  if you 've already currently got a proper home game , stick to that . 
  al is a good stopgap for people who do n't have or ca n't find a real game , but it is very much an inferior form of d&d . 
  the problem is that historically , while both boss-held and strapped-on shields exist , boss held shields are historically somewhat more common . 
  and even if they were n't , they * definitely * were common * enough * that they deserve to be represented in the game . 
  i would definitely say that allowing a player to drop a shield for free is not only entirely reasonable , but how it * should * be done . 
  allowing shields to be dropped for free is kind of the only way versatile weapons become a viable option . 
  you get your d8 damage normally , but can sacrifice the ac boost of a shield for a d10 damage at a moment 's notice . 
  the trade-off being you do n't get 2d6 or 1d12 damage like you would if you started without the shield . 
  oh i hope i did n't come across as accusative there . 
  if i did i 'm sorry , it was n't my intent . 
  i was simply trying to share some of the historicity of the matter , and then some of the mechanical game balance reasons for it . 
  yes , very keen . 
   dragon age : origins, 
  wanted to love it . 
  loved the setting . 
  liked the story . 
  enjoyed the characters . 
  but the gameplay was just * the worst * . 
  i really enjoyed combat in me , stopping time and strategically using abilities . 
  but something about doing the same thing in dragon age was just tedious as all hell . 
  i 'm still not sure why . 
  i do n't think i 've * ever * enjoyed a game less than i did with dragon age . 
  i got through the whole thing , but it was a massive slog . 
  after a couple of hours in to the expansion , i just decided it was n't worth it any more and stopped . 
  but the forgotten realms is almost the * definition * of generic high fantasy . 
   half life, 
  did not live up to the hype for me at all . 
  the shooter mechanics are slick , but a ** lot ** of the game involves platformer and puzzle mechanics , and it does those * really * badly . 
  * you ca n't jump the moment before you reach the edge of a platform , because unlike other games , if you do so , it 'll cause you to instead fall of the edge . 
  * trying to nudge boxes a small amount sideways causes them to fly all the way across the rooms . 
  just fucking ladders . 
  they 're terrible . 
  * 2/3rds of the way through it , there 's still really no sense of a plot . 
  i get that it was revolutionary for the time , but playing it today for the first time is going to lead you to a bad experience . 
  its style of shooter has been done better elsewhere in the time since , and everything else about its mechanics , i 'm pretty sure it were n't even good at the time . 
  the only great thing was its shooter mechanics , which , as amazing as they may have been back then , are n't worth it without nostalgia goggles . 
  people say it 's innovative for integrating the story into gameplay , but i did n't get any sense of story . 
  it just felt like a guy who somehow got planted in a world with monsters and humans who want to shoot him for no good reason . 
  and then he has to go around shooting everything he sees . 
  tomb raider was quite short , but i really enjoyed it . 
  the 2013 game was my first time with the franchise . 
  my one criticism was that , as a person who had never played any of the previous games in the series , [ ] ( #s `` i was unaware that supernatural forces were real and existed in that world . 
  i felt kinda blindsided at the end when it turned out all that was going on really * was * caused by magic , instead of being explainable through natural causes . '' ), 
  i still enjoyed it anyway , but did n't enjoy it as much as i might have , because i went in with the wrong expectations . 
  is their tax and sales charge exactly $ 1 ? 
  also since the + + is * postfix * , do you only need to pay the extra amount next time you visit the shop ? 
   from an australian store, 
  that 's illegal , then . 
  australian stores [ are required by law to include the gst in the price ] ( https://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices ) . 
  and if it was an overseas store with a pretend `` australian '' site , and the thing you 're buying is under $ 1000 , they 're not paying gst on it * anyway * ( although they probably will soon have to ) , so the `` gst '' surcharge was probably just a way for them to charge more while advertising less , and having a convenient-looking excuse for it . 
  either way , worth reporting to the accc . 
  i think you mean / r/bizarreuielements , if the recent posts are anything to go by . 
   even the sub-exchanges can be bad, 
  oh god yes they can . 
  i had a question about doing something on drupal 8 , when it was brand new , about how something did n't seem to be behaving how it should , so i asked on the drupal se . 
  this guy started helping me out , asking questions to try and tease out a solution , done through the `` comments '' section . 
  getting closer to a good solution to the problem . 
  i 'm not able to finish it by end of day though , so i leave and go home . 
  when i get home , i find out that some dipshit of a mod has deleted all of the comments , because `` stack exchange is not a place for conversation '' . 
  same dickhead goes around editing all the other users ' answers . 
  including * my own * answer when i found a solution and went back to post it . 
  the whole way the `` karma '' system functions on se is just terrible . 
  just so you know , that 's the `` face with look of triumph '' , which i do n't think is what you wanted to represent .
