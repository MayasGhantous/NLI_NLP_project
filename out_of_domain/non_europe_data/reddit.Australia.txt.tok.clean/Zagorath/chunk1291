  i 'm not sure how it is either , but apparently that 's what it is . 
  probably some japanese cultural thing , since emoji have their origin in japan . 
  i had a look through his twitter and was unable to determine anything . 
  even tried googling him and visiting his website . 
  there 's a bunch of pictures of him in america , and him talking about being in america ( california and florida are the parts i remember seeing or reading ) . 
  but there are also pictures of him skating down a road on the left side , with a car coming up behind him . 
  so it looks like wherever he 's from , he travels a lot . 
  but i ca n't tell where he is from . 
  can you buy through the google play store , or do they do the amazon thing where they make you exit and go to their website to pay for things ? 
  it might he a nice way to use some of the google opinion rewards money i 've accumulated , if i 'm able to use that . 
  i 'm kinda curious , what did they have to report about chermside shopping centre ? 
  like , uber eats i can understand since it 's a new `` cool '' thing . 
  shop a docket i 've never heard of , but i 'm guessing it is too . 
  but how do you make a news story about a shopping centre that 's been there for decades ? 
  curious , what culture is that ? 
  in anglophonic culture that definitely means `` ok '' . 
   we need a system of direct representation utilising online votes . 
  holy shit no we do ** not ** . 
  this is the worst possible way to go about democracy . 
  people are not , and can not be expected to be , informed enough on the wise range of issues governments are expected to deal with , to be able to give an informed and considered vote . 
  you 'd get people doing things like voting to lower taxes * and * increase healthcare and education spending . 
  elected representatives whose entire * job * is to do just that are a fantastic solution . 
  it 'd be better if we could choose these representatives in a better way , to provide more proportional representation . 
  but fundamentally , representative democracy is essential for a functioning government . 
  i have no idea what any of that means . 
  all i know is that if i run up to an edge , press spacebar right before i reach the edge , in any other game , i 'll jump across to the next platform . 
  in half life , i fall down . 
  that 's bad design . 
  i do n't want to and should not have to learn weird and unnatural techniques like `` crouch jumping '' in order to play it . 
  those can be there for advanced players if they want them , but they should not be required or expected of normal gameplay . 
  but that does n't really sound very groundbreaking . 
  maybe compared to other fps games of the time , but there were other genres that had plenty good stories back then . 
  spyro , baldur 's gate , and legend of zelda ocarina of time all came out in the same year . 
  i would describe the colours as dark red being difficult and bright red as impossible . 
   reddit is today 's ` alt.startrek.wesley.crusher.die.die.die `, 
  hahaha . 
  that analogy is hilarious . 
  but taking it in a literal sense , it kinda makes me sad that reddit and a lot of other online communities have taken the very deserved hate of wesley crusher and projected that on to wil wheaton himself . 
  on the back end , your language probably comes with a function to do it , if it 's a half decent one . 
  php has ` filter_var ( $ email_address , filter_validate_email ) ` , for example . 
  for front end , html5 does it for you . 
  just make it ` < input type = `` email ''  ` and your job is done . 
  no need to implement it yourself in either case . 
  [ htc ? 
  ] ( https://emojipedia.org/face-with-look-of-triumph/ ), 
  but are you seeing it the way it displays on htc ? 
  the swashbuckler is a perfect defence of op 's argument , really . 
  it 's arguably the archetype that is ** most ** able to benefit from dual wielding , since it can attack two separate people and get away safely . 
  dual wielding and toujours l'audace have perfect synergy . 
  what 's the source on that art ? 
  art used on this subreddit is required to include a source to give the artist credit . 
  i do n't really see the value of footwork . 
  you 're spending your bonus action to use it , and if you 're doing that , you might as well just use the disengage option . 
  i mean , i guess you get an extra 5 feet of movement total ? 
  does n't seem very much worth it . 
  lunge seems to have an arbitrary restriction in terms of when it can be used . 
  why can you not use it when carrying a buckler or a main-gauche ? 
  or something entirely unrelated to being a duelist , like a flask , a wand , or a flute ? 
  it serves a * somewhat * reasonable mechanical purpose , but does not make sense . 
  although , personally , i think a buckler or main-gauche is perfectly acceptable for a duelist to be wielding , so penalising that is still a mechanical problem . 
  giving two separate abilities at ninth level is highly unusual . 
  i would suggest removing anticipation entirely . 
  counter-attack is a pretty good ability , but like lunge , the `` not carrying anything in your other hand '' restriction seems unnecessary and unhelpful , in my opinion . 
  it 's also not worded very well . 
  i would suggest reading up on other abilities in the game which do similar things , and trying to imitate the way in which they are worded . 
  on guard is pretty great , taken on its own , and i think right of way probably is as well . 
  beyond what i 've discussed above , this has one major problem , which quite a few inexperienced homebrewers make . 
  it 's too focussed on combat . 
  combat is but one of the three pillars of the game , and good content should provide some utility in at least one of the other pillars . 
  read through all the existing rogue archetypes . 
  all of them have some social or exploration abilities . 
  it is also important for balance that not ** ever ** ability is focussed on combat . 
  also the presentation problem . 
  you should use a level 2 heading , not a level 1 heading , at the very beginning . 
  personally , i think this is not something that really needs to exist . 
  the swashbuckler archetype is already very good for creating a duelist , and some reflavouring and minor mechanical tweaks do a good job of turning it into more of a duelist . 
  [ i did this myself , in my `` duelist 's handbook '' ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/4kcj3fbal ) . 
  my duelist rogue archetype is essentially a reflavoured and slightly tweaked swashbuckler . 
  also useful : items and feats for bucklers and mains-gauches . 
  ( you can see [ the relevant reddit thread here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 6chur4/duelists _ handbook / ) . ), 
  in general , good homebrew should aim to be as small as possible . 
  to reflavour where that is feasible , to make minor tweaks where it is not , and to make something brand new only as a desperate last resort . 
  i do n't think a duelist is impossible to make with just some tweaks . 
  the criticism here is very much warranted . 
  as / u/thunfischgott , / u/armedpirate , and others noted , every ability it gives is related to combat . 
  that 's bad design for a rogue archetype . 
   you get everything you need, 
  personally , i think of duelists as intelligence based , not charisma . 
  it 's why i created a duelist rogue subclass which is 90 % based on the swashbuckler , with some minor tweaks to turn it from a swashbuckling charisma-based rogue to a thoughtful , precise , considered , intelligence-based rogue . 
  [ you can see it , as well as some other options for dueling , here ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/4kcj3fbal ) . 
   / off turn / sneak attacks, 
  you can already do that . 
  if you get an opportunity attack outside of your turn , if that attack otherwise meets the requirements for sneak attack ( for example , you have an ally also next to the target ) , you can use that ability . 
  by the way , use \\* asterisks \\* for * italics * . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r044sleow6i ) has lyrics that sound kinda similar to the vietnamese word for 35 . 
   self enabling attacks of opportunity on a rogue are not okay, 
  i agree that being able to use it * any time * someone enters your reach might be too much , especially combined with the extended reach this gets , but i would n't make such a broad blanket statement . 
  i made [ my own duelist rogue ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/4kcj3fbal ) ( based much more closely on the official swashbuckler ) , and it is able to get opportunity attacks against other creatures . 
  but in this case , it has a cost of one action to attempt to set up against another creature , and requires you win an ability contest , and then requires that creature attack someone other than you , or back away from you . 
  because of those limitations ( especially the fact that it requires you to forgo an entire turn 's worth of attacks in combat to set it up ) , i think it 's quite reasonable .
