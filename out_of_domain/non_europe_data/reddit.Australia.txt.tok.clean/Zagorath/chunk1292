  how old is he ? 
  because holy shit that drawing is better than i was expecting . 
  hey you should also try and reach out to the people that do the fear the boot podcast . 
  they 've talked about this sort of thing before from both first hand and second/third hand experience with it . 
   being shot did more damage on average than being tagged by a greatsword, 
  yeah , yeah it is . 
  why do you think nobody uses greatswords anymore ? 
  you could do it with just * one * , i think . 
  although it would n't be easy . 
  use it like a salmon ladder . 
  nothing came of that . 
  it has always been our rule that you must provide credit . 
  that was about the idea that even if you do provide credit , you should n't use art without permission . 
  which is not a rule on this subreddit . 
  not really sure why game mechanics are relevant . 
  action economy does n't matter here . 
  you pull yourself up , and the moment you reach the peak , press the button , quickly extend your arms up , and press the button again . 
  easy peasy . 
  well , if you 're strong enough . 
  maybe an athletics check to see if you are . 
  you should n't be stuck rigidly to the six seconds per turn action economy , because that 's designed only for balance in combat , not the rest of the game . 
  fuck the ninja warrior course . 
  just the salmon ladder scenes from season 1 . 
  that shit 's insane !, 
  i thought it was a no try to be honest . 
  i mean , i 'm * glad * it was given try , but it seemed to me he was clearly touching the line . 
  maybe i need a higher resolution screen or something . 
  maybe they 're counting half time ? 
  i dunno , probably reaching . 
  channel 9 is hard to defend . 
   optus have really downgraded in terms of their plans, 
  if i could make a suggestion , there 's basically zero good reason to be with optus . 
  there are a bunch of smaller mvnos that serve up optus 's network at ** far ** cheaper prices . 
  same service , but cheaper . 
  yomojo , vaya , and amaysim are all fantastically cheap and worth looking at . 
  cheers . 
  2 , `` wiosna '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwb7zeatkwu ) is in g minor , and it has been on the grade 3 syllabus before . 
  [ sheet music is available here ] ( http://ks.petruccimusiclibrary.org/files/imglnks/usimg/1/1c/imslp40247-pmlp13698-chopin--polish_songs_-_02_der_fr%c3%bchling.pdf ) . 
  just got ta ignore the vocal part . 
  it 's pretty much just doubling the piano right hand anyway . 
  you say that like it 's a bad thing ... 
  hey , autistic people are every bit as capable of being psychopaths or just arseholes as healthy people !, 
  you 'll get the best response if you post this on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is the best place to look , if you 're interested in d&d 5e . 
   if a player ... brings a homebrew idea to me , i 'm going to have to review it and figure it out, 
  not if you 're strict about what sources of homebrew you allow . 
  if you say `` only stuff on / r/boh5e '' , then you are guaranteed it will be well-balanced , and you only have to look and decide if you like it in terms of theme . 
  if you said / r/boh5e and `` things that get a good number of positive reviews on / r/unearthedarcana '' , you 've got something where other people have already done the work of ensuring it 's balanced . 
   have you seen codex : unearthed arcana ? 
  that 's not published . 
  that 's something a fan did to make the ua stuff look nicer . 
  the content was straight out of the wotc ua articles , balance problems included . 
   vampire : because vampires are something you are , not something you do . 
  unfortunately for balance reasons , a race , subrace , or template are simply not good options . 
  it * has * to be something with a sense of progression where the power comes at the expense of power otherwise . 
  [ this prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) does a good job of it . 
  the reason is that vampires are very powerful and ** need ** a lot of cool abilities to work . 
  but to keep that balanced , you ca n't just * get * it . 
  and the power level of a race or subrace is too low to be able to accommodate it . 
  you need powers of seduction . 
  great strength and speed . 
  transformations into bats or mist . 
  think of the gain in power as you level up as you embracing your power and/or getting more used to it , and able to wield it . 
  vampires in myth and legend have had their powers long enough to have fully embraced it , but pcs only recently obtained the power , so they take a while before they reach full strength . 
  is it possible to * edit * a subreddit 's notification settings , without unsubbing and resubbing ? 
  for example , choose a new karma score threshold , add/remove users or subreddits from the ignore list ? 
  if not , is it at least possible to export the * current * configuration for a subreddit , so i can manually edit it without needing to remember the whole list of ignores that has already been created ? 
  then explain why the reffing at game three last year was so fucking awful ? 
   the new settings will overwrite the old ones, 
  so the whole thing is overwritten ? 
  no way of , say , appending to or removing from the list of users being ignored ? 
  alright , cheers . 
   australia and the southern hemisphere is going into winter, 
  actually , it 's been winter in australia for 21 days now . 
  we use the start of the month as the start of the season , not the solstice . 
  because it makes no damn sense that the day which is the * epitome * of the season should be at the * start * of it . 
  you mean east australia ? 
  it 's about 21 days late for the actual winter season , for those of us down here in aus . 
  there 's hard evidence of * some sort * of supernatural powers , but unlike in a high fantasy setting like , say , the forgotten realms , i 'm not so sure there 's hard evidence of * religious * powers and true * gods * . 
  i think that 's a lot more ambiguous . 
  australian law operates under the idea that any weapon without a legitimate purpose ( and self defence is not considered a legitimate purpose ) is not permitted . 
  the idea is that you are n't allowed to prepare yourself for getting in to a fight . 
  things like guns or bows and arrows are allowed ( and if you 're american , i think you 'd be surprised at how easy to obtain a permit it is ) , but not for defensive purposes . 
  hunting , sport shooting , and protecting farm animals from wildlife are reasons people are allowed to own weapons like that . 
  leading is n't past tense either , it 's present continuous . 
  it can be past imperfect tense if prefixed with the verb to be ( e.g. 
  `` was leading '' ) . 
  `` the loranettes falter and withdraw '' is also clearly present simple . 
  lol guys . 
  `` being bad at english '' is not a valid report reason . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` item '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  also you should probably be aware that we 're going to be implementing a rule soon that requires titles be descriptive and useful . 
  you 're fine this time , but in the future try to make the title clearly explain what is in the post . 
  i can see how one would think that , but in practice it really does work . 
  it 's a much safer place . 
  you are allowed to defend yourself .
