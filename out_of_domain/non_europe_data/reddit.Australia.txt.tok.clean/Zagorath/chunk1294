  are you ariel winter ? 
  lol mate , music does not belong in that group . 
  it 's crazy hard to score highly in . 
  my school was one of the top in the region , with a median score of something like 37 now . 
  they also have a really fucking good music department . 
  but there has only ever been one 7 in hl music . 
  the year i went through , i was apparently the only student to get a 7 in all of the fobissea network of schools . 
  also what ? 
  most people i know did hardly any work over their summer holiday between the years . 
  maybe a bit of ee work and a few other ias , but not a lot . 
  it makes sense . 
  afl is a game of the same general type as soccer , being a free flowing game where possession easily changes hands etc. 
  ( hockey is another game i 'd put in this class ) , but afl is played on a way larger field . 
  so of course they 're gon na be running further . 
  today was the first time i saw our new fancy $ 5 note , because i literally never pay with cash here . 
  paywave is just so much more convenient . 
  even today it was only because someone else showed me it . 
  it 's nearly entirely theoretical . 
  the assignment is a research paper , no programming involved . 
  its follow up does have a practical component , but i guess if you 're an exchange student that 's not worth much to you . 
  i loved the course and found its content really interesting . 
  but i 'm also the type of person who is subscribed to a podcast called security now !, 
  and went through its entire archives , just for my own personal interest . 
  so when i say i would highly recommend the course , keep that in mind . 
  but i definitely would highly recommend it . 
  it 's both really interesting , and of course ** incredibly ** important for any software engineer to be aware of . 
  it 's fairly easy as well , if that 's of concern to you . 
  i do n't know anything about * who * is responsible , but the news this morning was reporting that apparently police do suspect it was deliberately set . 
  oh right . 
  i forgot to address that bit . 
  uhh , from memory , i think you should be fine without any computer networking knowledge . 
  they should cover the information that 's important in the course , i think . 
  csse2310 covers a bit of that stuff , but it 's mostly really basic and specifically about how things are implemented in unix . 
  a vague knowledge of the tcp/ip stack and the osi model layers should be more than enough , and even that i think they 'll probably teach . 
  if you find yourself lacking in any information related to that , i 'd recommend checking out security now !, 
  episodes [ 25 ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/25 ) , [ 26 ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/26 ) , [ 309 ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/309 ) , [ 313 ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/313 ) , [ 317 ] ( https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/317 ) , 323 , and 325 . 
  the latter ones being probably the less useful ones . 
  also if there are any topics in the course that you feel you could use a bit more understanding of , googling `` security now { { the topic } } '' might provide you a useful alternative explanation . 
  hope that helps !, 
  math3404 ? 
  sorry no , i have n't even heard of it before today !, 
  sounds kinda interesting though . 
  i 've never had any luck getting tampermonkey/greasemonkey scripts to work for me before . 
  this seems like an enormous burden on users for exceedingly little gain . 
  i stand firmly against this . 
  chrome . 
  i have used firefox in the past and have similarly never had success with user scripts . 
  nope . 
  to be fair , i 've never tried especially hard . 
  i try it , it does n't work , i give up . 
  maybe i could get it working by spending an hour or so figuring it out , but i 've never done that , and i would really rather not start now . 
  because i 've never had anything important to do with them . 
  and i think that this sort of burden on users is a bad idea . 
  especially when the league is having problems getting enough active users * already * , making it exponentially * harder * for more people to take part , for effectively zero real gain , seems like the absolute height of insanity . 
  thanks for the offer . 
  but i 'll wait to see if i get selected before trying to figure this out again . 
  i still think on principle it 's a bad idea . 
  the league has survived just fine for 7 seasons ( plus a nf league and a bunch of smaller comps ) without this . 
  i ca n't see any good reason that it should need more onerous burdens on players starting with the eighth season . 
  hey just a tip , it looks like you 've got a river running from sea to sea , butween ruby desert & tor and zyll & beowode . 
  op should have been told this without having to come and post on reddit about it . 
  that should have been done at the time of removing the post on the feedback forum . 
  this is extremely poor customer service . 
  posts that are n't pure spam should ** never ** be removed silently . 
  people should always be given a reason and explanation . 
   plebiscites have to pass a much higher bar than just `` did more than half the voters like it ? '', 
  to pass, 
  actually , no . 
  not normally . 
  [ a plebiscite normally only needs a simple majority . 
  ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/flagpost/2011/june/a_quick_guide_to_plebiscites_in_australiareferenda ) referenda need a double majority of a majority of people in a majority of states + a simple majority , but plebiscites are normally simpler . 
  that said , i learnt yesterday that apparently the coalition 's plan for * this * plebiscite was indeed to have it be a double majority , specifically because they know that would he more likely to fail . 
  could * theoretically * be overwritten with as high as 88 % in favour . 
  100 % of nsw , victoria , and queensland supporters , plus 100 % of act and nt , and slightly under 50 % support in all other states . 
  a majority in only 3 states , and a majority overall , but 4 states are required for a successful double majority . 
  obviously completely unrealistic , but that 's the theoretical ceiling based on current ( i used between 2011 and 2014 population figures for each state -- just what google spat out ) population figures . 
  but yeah , like i said , i was told just yesterday by someone i trust in political matters , that the coalition 's plan was to do this by requiring a double majority . 
  looking just now , i was not able to confirm this . 
  the only thing i found was an article ( i 'm not linking it because i do n't know if the site is allowed on this subreddit ) entitled `` everything you need to know about gay marriage plebiscite '' from almost exactly one year ago which had this quote :, 
   the prime minister 's office has confirmed that a simple national majority would be sufficient to pass the same-sex marriage plebiscite . 
  maybe they changed their minds more recently and my quick search seems to suggest that they 're preferring the simpler route . 
  yay !, 
  i think our fishy friend here may have been referring to the court of public opinion , which generally , especially in high profile cases , does work exactly as described . 
  all the media keeps saying he 's the third in charge `` behind the pope '' . 
  no one ever mentions who number 2 is . 
  i really want to know , damn it !, 
  we 're actually way ahead in some ways . 
  nsw has some fucking retarded road rules , and we have been the first to introduce some really good ones . 
  you forgot union . 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  we ai n't no damn yanks . 
  christians do n't need to be good to go to heaven . 
  all their preaching about goodness is really not important to their beliefs . 
  you just need to `` accept '' that jesus died on the cross for your sins , and you 're golden . 
  with starcraft , it 's always seemed to me that apm is far too important . 
  i prefer a game where someone who does n't know keyboard shortcuts but knows all the strategy is able to beat someone that can make a thousand mediocre actions oer minute . 
  warcraft i like a little more , but still i find the scale and pace a little different from my preferred style of rts . 
  my own unpopular opinion is also rts related . 
  age of mythology is the best age game , followed by age of empires 3 . 
  age 2 is just not a game that has held up well in my opinion .
