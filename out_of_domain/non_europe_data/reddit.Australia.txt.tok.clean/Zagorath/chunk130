  i 've elaborated on what i mean [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/165rvg/got_my_syllabus_today_for_university_i_think_im/c7t5rdg?context=3 ) . 
  edit : fixed link . 
  right , but why is a semibreve a `` whole note '' . 
  i 've got to be honest i do n't really understand that bit . 
  why is a crotchet not the `` whole note '' ( on account of being a whole , single beat in x/4 time which is by far the most commonly used ) , or a breve ( which is called a double-note or something like that ) . 
  it 's no where near as great as a lot of the other pieces mentioned here , or other works by the same composer , but the beethoven trio for piano , clarinet , and cello , is quite fun , and i imagine it 's one that is very unlikely to be played by anyone else . 
  oops wtf . 
  no idea what happened there . 
  should have been [ this link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/165rvg/got_my_syllabus_today_for_university_i_think_im/c7t5rdg?context=3 ) . 
  i somehow accidentally added a `` 0 '' to the end of the former link . 
  edit : by the way , i 'd just like to mention i 'm in much the same boat as you . 
  i use both operating systems on a day-to-day basis ( although only started using macs in about 2009 , and only regularly in 2010 ) , and i 'm extremely comfortable at using both . 
  i find it really hard to empathise with people who are n't good with computers . 
  to me it all seems a logical extension of things that they usually * do * know . 
  sidebar 's your best bet , but a few quick ones :, 
  tocata and fugue in d minor ( possibly by bach ), 
  in the hall of the mountain king , from peer gynt suite by grieg, 
  dies irae from mozart or verdi 's requiems, 
  night on a bald mountain , by mussorgsky , but you 'll want rimsky-korsakov 's arrangement for orchestra, 
  there are , of course , heaps more great pieces that should meet your needs , but there 's a few to get you started . 
  check the links by scrumptiouscakes for more . 
  death and the maiden also happens to be the title of an amazing play , named for the play 's use of this quartet . 
  that makes a play , based on a quartet , based on a song , based on a poem . 
  as i understand it , the minor version of fr\u00e8re jacques ( or bruder martin ) was actually the normal way the song was song at the time in austria . 
  nevertheless , it is indeed an absolutely haunting piece of music . 
  you may or may not care about this , but i personally am avoiding samsung because of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  that said , i 'm still waiting for the nexus 4 to be available so i can get one , and i 'd probably go with it over the siii even without the extra reason . 
  it 's a nexus phone so you know it 'll get updated for longer and more quickly than anything else , plus it 's native android which many consider much nicer . 
  it 's also much cheaper if you 're going to be buying outright . 
  as an aside , what are the different options for syncing between itunes and an android device , and what advantages/disadvantages do they have ? 
  right , my point was it could be a reason not to go with the galaxy s3 . 
  i went on to say that i probably would n't have gone with the s3 anyway , however were i on the fence that would have pushed me over in favour of something else . 
  ah interesting . 
  do you know how it compares with double twist ? 
  do you know if either of them is able to sync lower-bitrate version across , similar to how itunes can be set to produce lower bitrate versions to sync onto mobile devices ? 
  can you be held in contempt during jury selection ? 
  did you know she was asthmatic beforehand ? 
  i kinda feel like that 's something that , if you knew about , you probably shoulda realised ... 
  oh fair enough . 
  good on you for realising in the end , though . 
  personally i think there 's a place for both . 
  different kinds of concerts can both co-exist , i think , and with the same quality of performance . 
  just make it clear which it is when people are buying tickets . 
  i think any concert where people are expected not to clap ( i.e. , any concert with today 's concertgoing etiquette ) should by preceded by an announcement of how many movements there are , and the audience should be directly informed not to clap until the end . 
  it would honestly only take a minute , and they could do it before the conductor walks on stage so as not to ruin anything with the actual performance ( and add to that reminders to turn off phones etc. 
  as far as i know they do n't particularly exist now . 
  there 're a few small orchestras doing it , i believe , but no major ones . 
  a mass effect field . 
  nah we 're safe . 
  the quarians are the ones who got ta watch out for that . 
  espn 8 the ocho . 
  how about korean ? 
  is \uc6d0 considered one character or four ? 
  just tried it out . 
  apparently each syllable of korean text is treated as a single character by twitter . 
  and then repost it back it reddit , say it was `` a friend '' , and make fun of them for karma . 
   australian city, 
   flip flops, 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 it 's thongs , bitch . 
  is astigmatisimo derived from astigmatism ( defect of the eye ) and the italian suffix isimo meaning very or a lot ? 
  i 've heard them called jandels before , but never knew where it came from . 
  cool !, 
  i do n't just dislike her music , i think she is by far the most hideous thing i 've ever seen . 
  and she * chooses * to look that way . 
  my theory is that eventually it 'll get to the point where * everyone * in politics has grown up with facebook ( or whatever succeeds it ) , and then everyone will be facing scandal , and thus no one will . 
  i agree , really lovely at this tempo , but what 's the source for this being the intended tempo ? 
  i 'm trying to look up the notated tempo , but imslp 's down at the moment ... 
  edit : ah , it 's back up now . 
  [ this score ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/e1/imslp44549-pmlp04611-pachelbel-kanonundgiguefs.pdf ) calls it `` sostenuto , crotchet = 56 '' . 
  however , that score is published by seiffert , who [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pachelbel's_canon#history ) says gave tempi that were not supported by academic research . 
  wikipedia does n't ( at least that i could see ) say what academic research suggests the tempo * should * be . 
   listen to the silences, 
  some of the best advice you can ever give with regards to music , in my opinion . 
  edit : listening to the beethoven , it sounds like it was recorded in a room with a snare drum , but absolutely beautiful nonetheless . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/37/ ), 
   the idea is more that there is an entire area of research and study about how music this old might have been played, 
  but that does n't exempt it from having a source . 
  the area of research and study has to be from somewhere . 
  i think you 're probably right that pachelbel never did right down the expected tempo , but there has to be some sort of a source for why this one ensemble has decided they believe the faster tempo is the way it 's meant to be played . 
  the other guy says `` does not always '' and you 're saying `` sometimes you know '' . 
  there 's no reason you ca n't both be right , since neither of you is making an absolute claim . 
  got ta say , since they created communities , i 've been on g + a hell of a lot more lately . 
  i 'd still like to see it replace facebook with my real-life friends , but communities are brilliant for now . 
  eric schmidt has n't been ceo for at least a year now . 
  and larry page ( who is the current ceo ) are the co-founders of google . 
  others have addressed the `` do no evil '' bit . 
  cost is a real negative . 
  apple hardware costs far more than its equivalent from other companies . 
  however , everything in that comment appart from price was utter bullshit . 
   lul that is no where near enough to support the 1440p resolution, 
  well , obviously it is enough , because heaps of people are using them , and even doing graphic design , video editing , and the like on that graphics card you claim to be terrible . 
  the same can be said for the processor . 
  it clearly is enough power , and does n't need to be overclocked , as evidenced by all the people who do use it . 
  ( as a side note , you can `` turbo boost '' the base 3.2 ghz quad core up to 3.6 ghz , and the bto 3.4 ghz up to 3.9 ghz , if you really want the extra power . ), 
  you 're right , 8 gb of ram is n't enough for high end video and photo editing , that 's why people who are doing those high end things upgrade it . 
  in the 27 ' model you can upgrade to as much as 32 gb of ram , with 16 available as an intermediate level ( and 16 is most certainly enough for most video editing , but certainly not all ) . 
  and i do n't know what world you live in , but down here on earth 1 tb at 7200 rpm is a brilliant drive . 
  there 's also a 3 tb , as well as 1 and 3 tb fusion drives ( which work slightly differently to more conventional hybrid drives , although i do n't know how exactly ) and a 768 pure solid state . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , i doubt i 'll ever be getting one . 
  for desktops , i 'm windows all the way ( though i also doubt i 'll ever get a non-mac laptop again ) .
