  yes , i would . 
  i would kick up an ** enormous ** fucking fuss if they refused . 
  because again , it 's a simple quick software change , which makes it a poor analogy for piano keyboards . 
  hey , i 've flaired this `` race '' for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you were working with true maths , rather than computer science integer maths , then you simply wrap the whole rest of it in ` floor ( ) ` . 
  ` floor ( ( score - 10 ) / 2 ) ` . 
  how many people do you reckon are supposed to live in antarctica ? 
   all things are orbiting each other in n-body dynamics, 
  i was under the impression that the phrase `` x orbits y '' means that the gravitational centre of x and y is * inside * of y , or at least that it is much much closer to y than x ( to allow us to say jupiter orbits the sun ) . 
   binary planet system , which has been suggested for earth/luna before, 
  the barycentre of the earth -- moon system ( that is , the gravitational mid point between earth and the moon -- that is `` luna '' , in star trek 's terminology ) is well within earth , which makes it basically impossible to claim that they are a binary planet system . 
  it 's less than 4,700 & nbsp ; km from the centre of earth , while the planet has an over 6,300 & nbsp ; km radius . 
  the pluto -- charon system , on the other hand , * could * be argued to be a binary planet system . 
  the sun -- jupiter system ( i think it 's sol -- jupiter , in star trek ? 
  not sure as i 've never cared for those names ) also has a barycentre slightly outside the sun , though only by 7 % of the sun 's radius . 
   `` in-universe '' and all that jazz, 
  if you 're interested , the word to describe that is `` watsonian '' , as opposed to a `` doylist '' interpretation . 
  that is , are we explaining why sherlock holmes does something from the perspective of john watson , his in-universe friend and colleague , or from the perspective of arthur conan doyle , the author who wrote the novels in which he features . 
  is it ? 
  i know it 's used in some high end speakers because of its conductive properties , but that 's a very niche use . 
  diamonds also have a niche but critically important practical use , in the form of cutting edges and drills . 
  genuine question . 
  i 'm not really sure which one has more practical uses . 
  yeah we 've set up some automod rules to try to catch it if the title makes it completely clear what it is . 
  if the title does n't have enough information ( or it contains information that causes the automod to incorrectly flair it ) , it 's up to you to make sure that your post has the correct flair . 
  my bad . 
  true . 
  eh , not really . 
  the idea behind the law was to prevent violence . 
  there has n't to my knowledge been reports of a significant amount of violence at casinos . 
  there has at nightclubs and bars . 
  from that perspective , it makes sense . 
  note that i am absolutely ** not ** defending the law . 
  i think it 's dumb and we do n't need it for so many reasons . 
  it 's just that based on the reason that * the politicians * think that having the law is a good idea , it * is n't * necessarily inconsistent to not have casinos follow the same rules . 
  i seriously think it 's bullshit that id that 's slightly out of date ca n't be used for the purposes of proof of age anyway . 
  for proof of age , i reckon they should allow an id that 's up to 1 year ( or some other figure , maybe 6 months ) be considered legal . 
  it 's not like you 're possibly getting any * younger * , and the 1 year limit means you 're still going to have an id with somewhat up-to-date tech in it . 
  oooh , i love this . 
  here are a few more to try . 
  teacher , doctor , engineer , software developer , banker ( figure i 'd throw you an easy one there !, 
  i do n't think i necessarily agree with rules 2 and 3 . 
  but rule 4 is an absolute . 
  it ** must never ** be broken at all . 
   this is why i was glad to get mearls ' revised initiative in the ua . 
  because although it was flawed , i knew the community would get to work tweaking and revising and overhauling , to come up with all kinds of variations . 
  but the community has already been doing this , non-stop , since mearls first put out a tweet about it a month or so ago . 
  rolling only a single die is really interesting , but i fear it 'll result in way too many ties , since you 're generating a number that will usually be between 1 and 12 , and very often 1 to 8 . 
  breaking ties is always a pain in the arse , so a system which has fewer of them is better . 
  i like the system 's simplicity , but i fear ties will be too frequent . 
  plus , it has the problem that it greatly minimises the main advantage of this sort of system , which is that people plan a lot in advance . 
  if they only need to decide the highest single thing they 're doing , which is usually `` attack with weapon or cast spell '' , there 's not much thought to be had . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i was not familiar with this venue . 
  yeah a lot of catholics seem to think you 're `` technically a catholic '' if you were baptised when you were a baby . 
  brb , gon na try to disprove this . 
  the description you gave of how to break ties in the op is precisely the pain in the arse my previous comment referred to . 
  adding an extra die might actually make things worse i think , since two dice tend to cluster around their expected value . 
  when the claim is that the later game is the innovative one , of * course * you 're going to point out that , no , this earlier game did it first . 
  i heard about what happened in ac3 before i aye it , and decided then and there that i would never play ac3 or any subsequent ac game , even though i absolutely loved all the previous games . 
  age of mythology is the best age of empires game . 
  age 3 is a close second . 
  age 2 just did not age well . 
  it 's the guy holding the mic boom . 
  earlier on the show leaned a little more heavily on the mockumentary style than it does now , so you would see stuff like this . 
  the ee marking process is definitely bad , but it 's not * that * bad . 
  if your score was that low , it 's because your ee was not good quality . 
  my best guess is your supervisor did not know enough to give you advice on how to write an ee . 
  possibly even gave you advice that made things worse . 
  it 's a shame , but you should n't be complaining about the ibo and calling them thieves and `` corporate scoundrels '' ; because their system is bad , but not `` giving something of decent quality a score of 5/36 '' bad . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
   most often i see it used so that you can go from sword and board to two handed fighting without having to carry any other weapons . 
  unfortunately , raw , dropping your shield takes a whole action , which makes this unviable . 
  it 's the main mechanical reason that i personally home rule that dropping a shield requires only your normal free item interaction ( there are also flavour reasons behind that choice ) . 
  i can see it being near worthwhile for a barbarian . 
  use the shield until you rage , then drop the shield and take the weapon in two hands . 
  probably not a mathematically worthwhile trade-off , but since you 're getting the damage resistance of a raging barb , and it has such awesome flavour behind it , i think it 's probably worth doing anyway . 
  ** if ** you 're allowed to drop the shield for free , which is not raw . 
   my thought was to just delete dueling style since it overshadows the other options, 
  maybe restrict it to holding a weapon and nothing else . 
  or possibly allow it used in combination with a buckler or main-gauche ( both of which would need to have their own definitions made ) . 
  main point : do n't let dueling style be used with a full shield . 
  i saw a strawpoll recently that let you choose more than one answer . 
  that would work best for this . 
  have `` monday '' and `` tuesday '' as the options ( no `` i do n't care '' ) and let people select either or both , based on their availability .

  braden lawra , based on my understanding of english mode tengwar . 
  ( i more commonly work in quenya mode . ), 
  edit : on second thought , the second word is probably laura . 
   i just finished reading the trilogy, 
   the lord of the rings is often erroneously called a trilogy , when it is in fact a single novel , consisting of six books plus appendices , sometimes published in three volumes . 
  to quote the forward to the single volume edition i have . 
  anyway , your observations regarding saruman are quite apt . 
  he * was * quite pathetic at the end , and it 's quite sad how far he fell . 
  glad that was given try , but imo they should have to have * control * of the ball , not just barely keeping in contact with the ball .
