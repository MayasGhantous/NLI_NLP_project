  it 's available here in australia . 
  i would have assumed europe and north america would have had it too , if we do ... where is it not available ? 
   regions with highly constrained connectivity, 
  like australia ? 
  the fuck ? 
  our wired internet might qualify for that definition , but our mobile telcos and speeds are actually better than america 's by far . 
  i finally made the switch to lite a month or two ago , when the full messenger app started crashing at least a couple of times per day . 
  i half reckon it was another one of facebook 's unethical psychology studies . 
  i miss chat heads , but in hindsight it 's worth it even without the crashing , just for getting rid of the public chat room notifications they were spamming me with , and the snapchat stories rip-off . 
  at this point i use facebook almost only for messenger ( using the lite app or messenger.com on desktop ) . 
  i go to the main site maybe once per week , and actually post something maybe twice per year . 
  facebook as a company seems to have done everything they could to drive me away from their service . 
  i 'd drop them even in messenger if a good alternative existed . 
  good alternative means ( a ) uses a username or email address , ** not ** a phone number , as id , ( b ) is available for android and as a desktop web app , and ( c ) i can get my friends and family to switch . 
  ( c ) being by far the hardest . 
  i 'd really like allo to be the alternative , because that assistant seems like it would be great for my friend group , but i 'm not going to invest the social capital in getting people to switch until there 's a desktop version and it uses your google account as the id instead of fucking phone number . 
  i know most of reddit prefers ublock , but i love adblock plus for its acceptable ads policy . 
  you can turn it off if you want , but i love having them allow through ads automatically if they are simple static images . 
  it works fine for me on reddit , for example . 
  i also make an exception to the no audio/video ads on pages that are themselves * about * audio/video , like the youtube watch page . 
  it 's not a net neutrality issue because it 's about software the users choose to put on their computer , not data ending sent to them through their isp . 
  plus , assuming google uses an acceptable ad policy similar to the one abp uses , it 's something any reasonable user would be fine with , and any advertiser should recognise is the acceptable way of going about business . 
  it * was * great , until earlier this year . 
  we had * years * of it being hands down the best mainstream chat application available before they started adding crap like stories and public chat rooms , and the other shit . 
  thankfully , messenger lite still exists , and the only important , useful , feature that it is missing is chat heads . 
  if they make an allo web version , and let you use allo tied to your google account rather than your phone number , i will be switching immediately . 
  i 'll force my close friends and family to switch by not contacting them any other way . 
  sadly i do n't see that happening any time soon . 
  it 's apparently a region thing , not a device thing . 
  we 've got it here in australia , but americans are out of luck . 
   the distributor informed me that to get a replacement , i had to send the book straight to the wizards of the coast in renton ( wa ) , usa . 
  ouch . 
  where do you live ? 
  because where i am , this is not legal . 
  as a customer you are legally entitled to a replacement or refund from * either * the manufacturer or the distributor . 
  your choice . 
  [ literally the first result in a google search for `` ib extended essay criteria '' ] ( http://xmltwo.ibo.org/publications/dp/group0/d_0_eeyyy_gui_1012_1/html/production-app3.ibo.org/publication/258/part/3/chapter/7.html ), 
  the ib website itself has the criteria publicly available . 
  what 's polair ? 
  why the hell are punisher and star trek in there ? 
  they have n't even started coming out yet !, 
  out of all these , most were either a show i know and hate against one i do n't know ( on which case , vote for the unknown ) or one i know and like against an unknown ( go the known , obviously ) , or between two i do n't know ( just pick the better sounding one , or guess at random ) . 
  only * once * did i have to choose between two i know and like . 
  ncis franchise and i think it was brooklyn 99 . 
  ended up going for b99 , mainly because ncis la exists . 
  i have no idea . 
  it was moronic . 
  way worse than their decision not to allow it to send sms . 
  it 's the same reason i refuse to use those other two chat applications . 
  i 'm not in finland or even in the eu , but from my quick search , [ eu law says that the seller is responsible for any faults ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm ) . 
   if goods you bought anywhere in the eu turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised , the seller must ** repair ** or ** replace ** them ** free of charge **, 
  it 's certainly * possible * that i 'm misunderstanding the law , but i suspect you have the right to demand the seller replace the product for free , rather than being palmed off on to the manufacturer . 
  the scanners are not per se a bad idea , but there have been many reports of international ids , passports , etc. , and that is unacceptable . 
  unless or until they can work flawlessly , or they can have a workaround so as to not inconvenience non-australians , they should roll this back , imo . 
  mate , after facebook did research in deliberately affecting people 's * emotions * for the purposes of research , and received zero substantial repercussions , i kinda feel ethics have basically gone out the window . 
  sadly . 
   i mean from 480 , xxx people , 23 were turned away . 
  the lesson learned for them is to stay away , sure ... 
  well , the system is new . 
  surely they do n't yet have records of all the people who are causing provokes ? 
  should n't it become more effective over time ? 
   or just get to the venue before 10pm . 
  they 're only * required * to do it from 10 , but when i went out last weekend we were scanned at quarter to nine . 
   or 11pm in the case of last night , after state of origin, 
  was this something actually put into the law ? 
  i genuinely do n't know , and am curious . 
  what other exceptions are there ? 
   as well as that , there 's also teething incidents like the one highlighted at the gresham a few days back when the venue had to turn away a group of 50-60 year old international winemakers because they did n't have appropriate identification . 
  this , for me , is the biggest argument against it . 
  not only people who do n't carry id ( that 's kinda their own fault ) , but people whose id does n't work with the system properly should not be excluded . 
  oh shit ... i also had chicken for dinner tonight ... from their biggest local competitor , but still . 
  wow that 's really unfortunate . 
  at the concerts i 've been to in brisbane , there is student pricing for seats in any location you 'd like . 
  for example , later this month there 's a performance of the planets . 
  depending on where you sit , standard adult price is $ 97 or $ 117 . 
  student price in * either * location is $ 50 . 
  certainly still prohibitively expensive for those that are n't certain they 'll love it -- i myself only go to concerts where i already * know * i love the headlining piece , whereas if it were $ 20 or less , i might go to discover more things i 'm not familiar with -- but at least for that student price you can get the best seats in the house , if you book early enough that they 're still available . 
   who did n't learn mussorgsky from watching fantasia ? 
  on the other hand , fantasia 2000 turned me off of il pini di roma for a long time , because i was pissed off its finale was played in its entirety , whereas the excellent first movement of beethoven 's 5th for some reason got neutered removing most of the development and the first half of the recapitulation . 
  it was n't until over a decade later that i performed the piece and realised how awesome il pini is . 
   there 's another article in the news every few weeks about how it helps concentration , makes babies smarter , etc, 
  the main square in my city plays classical music late at night . 
  it apparently deters hoodlums from staying there and messing stuff up ( to my understanding , this is actually a well-studied and backed-up effect , unlike the other examples ) . 
  i always enjoy going through there and occasionally recognising the piece !, 
  it 's great fun . 
  it 's illegal to take footage of things where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  if there are wide open glass windows , they probably do n't have that . 
  if it 's the sort of smaller windows on a normal house , with curtains covering the edge of the window but not actually necessarily drawn , they probably * do * have an expectation of privacy . 
  i would go further . 
  i ** fully ** disagree with this change . 
  i am ** very ** disappointed by this change . 
  these discussions are really interesting . 
  this is a place to discuss broader trends in gaming over a long period of time . 
  genres that we love and have great older games in , but which do not have as many recent releases , are basically the * perfect * example of discussion that is relevant to patient gamers , in my opinion . 
  the second bullet point is a little less useful here , but being posted here it does carry the implication of `` what * older * game '' , which is highly useful for patient gamers in deciding which older games are worth playing . 
  the third one is only slightly behind the first bullet point in relevance to this subreddit . 
  controversial opinions usually seem to relate to games that are either highly popular or highly unpopular . 
  these are older games of interest to the patient audience . 
  the recent spat of posts did get a little repetitive , but that 's largely because it suffered from the / r/askreddit effect of `` what do you think of x '' , being followed shortly afterwards by `` what do you think of \u00ac x '' , and shortly after that , a repost of `` what do you think of x '' . 
  if you could clamp down on that sort of event , it would be ideal .
