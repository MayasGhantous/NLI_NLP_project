  do n't allow contrapositive or inverse posts about a discussion within a week of the original question being asked , and do n't allow identical questions within the same month . 
  or something like that . 
  mainly , i do n't like this change because this sub is the only place i see worthwhile gaming discussion . 
  i 've unsubscribed from / r/gaming because it 's useless and memey . 
  i 've unsubbed from / r/games because it 's too focussed on recent games , rumours , news , and other bullshit that i do n't care for . 
  i like the discussion about broader gaming trends over time , and that 's something that comes perfectly natural to an audience more interested in staying a little behind the curve . 
  if this change is n't reversed , i 'm probably going to end up unsubscribing from here as well , because what 's the point ? 
  to the user who reported these posts for `` update flooding '' : thanks for your concern , but op has done exactly the right thing here , by deleting the older post at the time that the new version is released . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i am still very much against this even after edit 2 . 
  why you should an interesting discussion about long term trends in the industry have to be reframed as `` and what games would you recommend for me ? '', 
  that just neuters the whole conversation . 
   i do n't want to become another marketing avenue . 
  but that 's exactly what this change will cause . 
  if you ca n't have actual discussions about more broad concepts in gaming , literally all it will be is a place to say `` you should buy this slightly old game '' . 
  hear , hear !, 
  this is so incredibly well said . 
  sure , but the recent spate of threads here has been the exact * opposite * of that . 
  it 's been changing to more higher quality discussions . 
  the whole omnibus series is excellent !, 
  i only saw the last ~ 15 minutes of normal time , plus golden point time . 
  but based on only that bit of play , i do n't agree with the majority of people here complaining about a boring game . 
  it was a spectacularly exciting finish imo . 
   by allowing them to intentionally forgo certain actions like the move action, 
  yeah , but that specific example ( that is , forgoing your * movement * ) is a terrible design that should not be used . 
  it 's been explained many times in many other threads . 
  having a cost for movement makes no sense in terms of flavour , and causes harm in terms of gameplay . 
  sorry , but this post has been removed for lacking a flair . 
  you 've been warned in the past that you are required to flair your submissions in this subreddit . 
  feel free to resubmit it , if you remember to flair it appropriately . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' .

   i agree this subreddit has a unique community . 
  that 's not something i want to lose . 
  losing that community is ** exactly ** what this rule change is going to do . 
   patience is not just about waiting to buy games , but also having patience in how one looks at games , gaming , game reviews , the gamer community , development , marketing , etc. 
  posts about all of those , except for `` waiting to buy games '' , will be banned under this new rule , which will destroy the subreddit 's value . 
  a sticky is a terrible idea . 
  it 's where conversations go to die . 
  it 's basically banning conversation while trying to say you have n't banned it . 
  a day where anything goes is the best of the options you 've provided , as long as it 's from midnight new zealand time until midnight hawai'i time . 
  that is to say , if it 's `` discussion friday '' , it should be acceptable to post something on friday , no matter where in the world you are , if it 's friday in your own time zone . 
  but this is still a poor option , because it means that the subreddit is good on fridays , and only low quality posts are allowed any other time . 
  the exact * reverse * of most of this sort of `` anything goes day '' rule on other subreddits . 
  but i am still firmly against any change from the status quo . 
  the primary value proposition of this subreddit has , in the past , been as a place to discuss things that one notices about gaming when looking at games from a patient perspective . 
  that is to say , considering mostly games that are older . 
  from that point of view , it 's a place that threads like `` which ( sub ) genre of games that became less popular over the years do you miss the most ? '', 
  are ** perfectly ** suited . 
  discussions about trends in gaming over a long period of time , and more considered conversations about gaming in general . 
  / u/i _ made_that_mistake 's top level comment said it best :, 
   this was a place where gamers tired of buying into the hype of unreleased games and of people pre-ordering games and then being disappointed when it 's released , could have more informed discussions of gaming . 
  here people would discuss games that have been released , reviewed , and for which a general consensus already exists , and in this way we can avoid the dissapointment of a new game not living up to the hype , and also not play into the greedy tactics of big game developers, 
   the whole spirit of the sub is about helping other people make informed decisions on game purchases , and also letting them discuss games from whatever time period , because in this community they 'll always be relevant, 
  really , the whole comment is spectacular quality , but those two little extracts really hit home what this sub has been about up until now , and what will be lost if this terrible rule change goes ahead . 
  this subreddit is / r/patientgamers . 
  it 's a `` gaming sub for ** people ** who wait at least 6 months after release to play a game '' ( quoting the sidebar , emphasis mine ) . 
  it 's never in the past been exclusively a place to discuss the specific act of playing a game that 's very old . 
  and it should not limit itself to that now . 
  if it does , the community will be much worse off for its loss . 
  i also think that jetmax has conducted himself * extremely * poorly in this thread , and should very seriously consider stepping down , or at the very least , consign himself to behind-the-scenes work , and step down from a role of communicating with the community . 
  because the communication of this has been * completely * botched . 
  the entire mod team should be embarrassed about his behaviour , especially ( but not exclusively ) in the various conversations with / u/ohaikrikket scattered across this thread . 
   does that mean we should allow general discussion ? 
  yes . 
  * without a doubt * . 
  this is where the subreddit 's high quality comes from . 
  generic `` is this a good game '' , or `` wow i really liked this game '' posts are low quality and do not encourage good conversation . 
  open ended questions about broader topics encourage greater discussion of a higher quality . 
  that 's what this subreddit should be about . 
  these posts should be * encouraged * , not relegated to a single day , and * certainly * not banned outright . 
  those look like just more verbose and kludgy versions of the exact same titles , to be honest . 
  * which ( sub ) genre of games that became less popular over the years do you still currently play , what are some prime examples that we should try ? 
  is exactly the same as, 
  * which ( sub ) genre of games that became less popular over the years do you miss the most ? 
  except that for some reason you now * have * to still play these games ( so if for whatever reason you yourself have not played an rts or a tycoon sim recently , you 're not welcome in the thread any more ) , and you 're now explicitly telling people to recommend specific games , despite that already being implicitly part of the broader conversation around the topic . 
  * whats a game where you played after the hype died down , where you hold a controversial opinion against the consensus, 
  is just, 
  * what are your most controversial gaming opinions ? 
  except it takes longer to say , given the context of it being shared on this subreddit . 
   anyone born outside of ireland who has one or more parents who are irish citizens are automatically irish citizens, 
  this sounds to me like it means that : if your parents are irish citizens , you are automatically an irish citizen . 
  further , it means that if you are an irish citizen , your children are automatically irish citizens . 
  this means , logically , that if your grandparents are irish citizens , your parents must be irish citizens , which means that you are an irish citizen .
