  we all accidentally speed a little sometimes , but you should be paying enough attention to your speed that it 's rare . 
  my parents , for example , have been driving for 40 years without a single speeding ticket in australia , and only one overseas . 
  ( i have n't either , but a tenth the time means it is n't very impressive . ), 
  wtf is the point of marking it as a spoiler if it 's in the fucking title . 
   when i need a specific degree to call myself a software engineer, 
  you mean like right now ? 
  software engineering is a degree . 
  if you have n't got that degree , you 're not a software engineer . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext . 
  see [ our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced style and formatting options on this subreddit . 
  reddit 's formatting is markdown . 
  one of the most widely used and simplest markup languages in the world . 
  does n't he want it to be able to do that on the actual physical kindle device ? 
   with a car you have to pay for insurance , rego , fuel , licence , repairs and maintenance . 
  also , you know , the actual cost of the car . 
  and parking costs if using it to uni , the city , etc. 
   not to mention all the other endless benefits of bus over car . 
  to play devil 's advocate , a car also has great intangible benefits over public transportation . 
  being able to go anywhere at any time , being able to go places pt does n't go , etc. 
  hi sorry , but this subreddit is n't the place for homebrewery tech support . 
  you should contact its creator , / u/stolksdorf , or use the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) . 
  this post is being removed . 
  thanks . 
  i can try to help you myself though , if you 'd like . 
  could you share with us the share page of something you 're currently actively working on ? 
  and possibly the edit page of a different test document set up by you ? 
   except it 's garbage compared to gboard, 
  think you mean that gboard is garbage compared to swiftkey , surely ? 
  * it arbitrarily will just choose not to show the predictions in some environments , including when doing searches on google . 
  also when searching for apps in the play store . 
  * it requires a really long press and hold on keys to get at symbols underneath them , instead of being able to click , hold , and drag in the required direction all in one smooth , quick , motion . 
  * even when you do long press and hold , its range of recommendations are very limited . 
  long press on d does n't give , for example , '' \u0111 '' . 
  in fact , it does n't give anything . 
  * it does n't add a space automatically after commas , full stops , and other punctuation . 
  swiftkey is a * vastly * better keyboard to use , * especially * on ** google 's own apps ** .

  gboard is a load of unusable crap compared to swiftkey . 
  and somehow when using ** google 's own apps ** ( like search and the play store ) , the gap between the keyboards widens even further in favour of swiftkey . 
  the term for that is acquihired . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know the area . 
  that does n't surprise me though , because everything i 've heard about nsw road rules and infrastructure leads me to think that the nsw state government and the sydney local councils are utterly retarded at dealing with roads . 
  from the 90/100 speed limit for learners/p platers , to cyclists not being allowed on the pavement , to actually * removing * existing cycling infrastructure . 
  i 'm thankful that the laws and infrastructure where i live are generally more sane than that . 
  poor signage is especially poor form , doubly so if the limit in the poorly signed area is * under * the standard 50 km/h in built-up areas ( i.e. , it 's less bad if the limit is 60 and you think it 's 50 than if it 's 40 and you think it 's 50 , though both are bad ) . 
  if you genuinely did n't know the speed limit had dropped because of the poor signs , i am 100 % on your side here . 
  but , for better or worse , if you * did * know the speed limit , you need to be doing it . 
  campaign for better speed limits , vote for less retarded councillors . 
  but the speed limits are n't a recommendation , they 're the * maximum * speed you can go , by law . 
  and if you know what the limit is , there 's no excuse for exceeding it consciously , or being more than about 5 over briefly unconsciously . 
   well shit mr perfect, 
  haha . 
  far from it . 
  ** very ** far from it when it comes to driving . 
  but because i 'm not a particularly experienced driver , i make sure not to speed . 
  it 's not very complicated . 
  uhh . 
  did you link the wrong image there ? 
  that 's a ( unofficially ) proposed new flag for the us state of utah . 
   to try and keep the decision from undermining turnbull, 
  to be fair , that 's surprisingly good sense coming from the lnp , if abbott 's recent comments are worth anything . 
  it 's not about being cheap . 
  if it were , torrents are the easy option . 
  op is obviously interested in the social experience of watching a show with a large audience . 
  yeah , it 's not for me . 
  a lot of people like it though , so \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i 'm 90 % sure that 's not true where i live . 
  admittedly i ca n't find any hard evidence to that effect , but i also ca n't find evidence that it 's true for other engineering disciplines , so i think it says more about how the information is laid out online than about the fact . 
  the usa is * defined * as a first world country . 
  1st world means the us and its allies during the cold war . 
  2nd world is the soviet allies , and 3rd world is the rest . 
  that weird oddity of history is why it 's generally better to use `` developing country '' when talking about poor places , or mocking shit places . 
  if you limit yourself to a single nation , sure . 
  but you can have the same convenience as that and see far more variety and more interesting things by travelling around the intersection of the shengen area and the eurozone . 
  right , but the only reason you would limit yourself to a single country is because of the convenience . 
  when there are multiple different countries all using the same currency , and where you only need to deal with customs and immigration once , and where these multiple countries are in an area a little * smaller * than the other country , so travel distances are decreased , what reason is there to limit yourself in that way ? 
  at the most recent opening of parliament , she apparently wore a dress sporting the european union flag . 
  seriously , it 's hard enough as a cyclist with pedestrians and drivers all hating you for existing . 
  there 's no need for people to make it worse by being in a bike only path . 
  i do n't know about bike paths in general , but at least on the bicentennial , roller blades ( and , i would guess , by extension , skateboards and scooters ) are * explicitly * permitted on the bike lane . 
  the closest to a specific law i can find is [ here ] ( https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/skateboards ) , which does n't explicitly state how they interact with bike paths/lanes , but kinda implies that they are allowed on them , by stating that wheeled toys must `` give way to bicycles on a bicycle path '' . 
  ca n't give way if you are n't on it to begin with , i think . 
  but i really do n't know for sure . 
  i 'm just guessing and inferring from what little i could find . 
  it 's some rather antiquated english , so if it 's your second language or something it might be difficult to parse . 
  the new international version is a little clearer :, 
  18 like a maniac shooting, 
  flaming arrows of death, 
  19 is one who deceives their neighbor, 
  and says , `` i was only joking ! '', 
  it also has * no * autocorrect on google or the play store , for some fucking bizarre reason . 
  and inserting punctuation is slow as hell since you ca n't press the full stop and swipe to the side immediately , instead having to wait for a long press to register . 
  it 's a * terrible * keyboard compared to swiftkey . 
  i mean , if we 're gon na be stupidly pedantic , it should be `` et cetera '' .
