  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
   ohh , that 's interesting . 
  i had not heard that !, 
  yup . 
  the problem is , and i think / u/glynstlln fails to mention this , as it 's rather important , that the way wizards is marketing it is very much as though it is * their * product being outsourced to curse . 
  they market it this way , but refuse to actually treat their consumers properly accordingly .

  the above comment was referring to places within the usa . 
  the places famous for being the most nationalistic , like the south , are less innovative than places line california and new york , which are generally less nationalistic . 
   it blew everyone 's minds when jeremy crawford stated in the sage advice podcast that based on raw , it 's impossible to roll a perception check result that 's lower than your passive perception, 
  it did ? 
  did n't blow my mind . 
  it gave me a nice satisfactory answer to a question i had been wondering , but it answered it in the most logical and straight-forward way . 
  that passive perception would work in this way is the most obvious solution to the problem . 
  vampirism at least has a single universally adored homebrew option in the form of / u/the _ singular_anyone 's prestige class . 
  there have been a lot of attempts at races , classes , prestige classes , and feat chains to make lycanthropes work . 
  some are better than others . 
  but none has achieved the same level of approval that the vampire option has . 
  holy shit . 
  optus has gotten a ** lot ** better since the last time i took a serious look at them . 
  's $ 30 plans are n't enough for you ( because they 're clearly better than optus 's $ 30 option ) , then for $ 40 and above optus has some crazy good plans !, 
  wtf was the nsfw tag for ? 
  my bank enforces an 8 character maximum password limit .

  it 's not quite as bad as it sounds , because they require 2fa for external transfers . 
  it 's definitely less than ideal though . 
  ducking finally . 
  2 years is what they do in korea . 
  but then , korea is one of the only countries in the world where it makes sense for them to have a lot of people with military experience . 
  the comment you replied to us arguing that you should join either labor or liberals even though you do n't like a lot of their corruption or self-centredness . 
  only by people who are against that shit joining and being active within the party , can that state of things change . 
   just because they inhabit the same body is irrelevant . 
  holy shit no it is not . 
  she holds many titles , but is only one human being . 
  she is a head of state who does n't , as a person , care about the country she rules . 
  she 's spent less time in australia than my newborn cousin once removed . 
  she supports a different country on the cricket . 
  she 's a human , and her allegiance is first and foremost to a country other than australia . 
  and that is ** insane ** , in a head of state . 
  i think it 's ridiculous . 
  as a counter example , britain is obviously a much bigger political target for foreign nations . 
  and in britain , not only can dual citizens stand for parliament , but people who are not even citizens of britain at all are able to stand . 
  specifically , irish and commonwealth citizens who are permanent residents can stand . 
  yes , that means a 100 % solely australian citizen can move to britain and stand for parliament over there , and yet an australian who is born on britain ca n't stand here , without first renouncing their british citizenship . 
  by external transfer , i mean transfer to an account under different ownership . 
  without the 2fa all they can do is change between my savings and spending account , or lock some of my money up in a long-term high interest savings . 
  they ca n't transfer money to a different account at the same bank . 
  indeed they do . 
  after three or so attempts you got ta call them or go into a branch to get it unlocked . 
  but with how easy social engineering is , i 'm not entirely convinced this is a completely effective option . 
  just checked . 
  mine is definitely case sensitive , thankfully . 
  see other comments for why this particular security lacking is n't so much of an issue . 
  plus they have fantastic rates and zero fees for normal usage . 
  1 probably ca n't do much . 
  but it 's the same as voting . 
  1 person ca n't change the result , but it 's still a terrible idea not to vote . 
  plus , the entire party does n't matter quite so much as the local member . 
  1 person can probably have a pretty decent amount of voice at choosing the local member for preselection . 
  if you 're a centrist liberal member , you can help prevent the religious extreme right from getting members in parliament by stopping them from ever getting on the ballot , for example . 
  not even joking , i do n't know my username . 
  i store it in a password vault . 
  meanwhile , my bank password is one of the only passwords i still keep memorised . 
  you could do that prior to hashing , too . 
  so it 's not really an indication of unhashed passwords . 
  hans zimmer in film music . 
  i 'm taking `` the comic sans '' to mean something that 's really popular among people uneducated in the area , but widely detested by people who know what they 're talking about . 
  i 'm an android guy through and through , but i would sooner buy an iphone than a samsung one , just because fuck samsung . 
  edit : i thought about it a bit more . 
  no i probably would n't , tbh . 
  i value android too much . 
  but i would definitely be rooting and installing a rom that gets me as close to nexus/pixel experience as possible , if i had to buy a samsung . 
  because again , fuck samsung . 
  what pisses me off is that ebay just recently got rid of the option of proper token-based two factor auth . 
  they used to use the standard symantec 2fa app . 
  now you have to use sms codes , or go without two factor . 
  ** why the fuck would you take a step backwards !!!, 
  the right are the ones that use arguments like `` we should do this because religion '' or `` we should be against these people because of their religion '' . 
  the left says things like `` 99 % + of scientists believe this , so we should probably do something about it '' or `` doing this in that other country had good results , so maybe we should also consider it '' . 
  which side of politics is about intelligence , and which is morality , again ? 
  yeah it 's token-based , not sms . 
  would the baby be * born * that exact time , or * conceived * then ? 
  avatar seems to imply the next avatar is * born * right at the moment the previous one dies , but there 's something to be said for the other viewpoint , too . 
  like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/secureid_token_new.jpg ) . 
  mobile phone apps like symantec 's `` vip access '' ( which paypal uses ) are also token-based 2fa . 
  just wan na point out that `` anti-religious '' and `` do n't claim that there 's no god '' are not viewpoints necessarily at odds with each other . 
  one can be anti-religious while still make an agnostic claim . 
  i hate most of the real-world religions because many of them harbour hate towards various groups and put ridiculous limitations on what their members are allowed to do , and all of them make at least a couple of verifiably false claims . 
  that does n't mean i do n't think it 's possible that * some * god actually does exist . 
  just that if there is one , none of the existing religions can possibly be correct , and even if they were , they 're still broadly speaking harmful . 
  that 's true .
