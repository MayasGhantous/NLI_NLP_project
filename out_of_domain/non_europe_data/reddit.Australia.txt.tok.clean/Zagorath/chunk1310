  that 's also not what happens in countries with universal healthcare . 
  this feels more like a libertarian argument than a conservative one , to me . 
  in general , libertarians are 100 % about ideology , and they do n't care about what 's actually going to create the best outcomes , or any consequences that their ideology might result in . 
  no one is forcing you to be a doctor . 
  no one is preventing you from striking for higher pay if you think that 's what you deserve . 
   guy 's, 
  is this meta , or just a genuine mistake ? 
  sorry , but this post has been removed for lacking a flair . 
  you 've been warned in the past that you are required to flair your submissions in this subreddit . 
  feel free to resubmit it , if you remember to flair it appropriately . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  this is true only in a purely theoretical sense . 
  but the person who embodies the crown is in fact british , and has allegiance to britain far more than to australia or canada . 
  i personally did not like the zendikar vampires , because there seemed to be a flavour attached with that which does n't quite match up with the normal assumptions of a vampire . 
  vryloka may not be technically the same thing as vampires , but their culture etc. 
  matches much more closely with what you would expect , and the mechanics of them work really nicely at encouraging that . 
  [ here is the adaptation i made of vryloka for 5e ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) , based on their 4e canonical incarnation . 
  additionally , once they reach level 5 , i would highly encourage allowing the player to use / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) . 
  it allows for the ** full ** vampire flavour experience , while remaining excellently balanced and allowing them a good mechanical progression . 
  the only problem with that is that op asked for level 1 , whereas that starts at level 5 . 
   john williams . 
  i 'm probably not helping my case . 
  actually , john williams is excellent . 
  he 's the gold standard of film composers alive today . 
  some other greats included james horner , jerry goldsmith , and korngold . 
  and some composers that i consider one-hit wonders ( in that they 've done one thing that was fucking * amazing * , but listening to their other work i 'm unimpressed ) include howard shore for lord of the rings & the hobbit , and ramin djawadi for game of thrones ( though in djawadi 's case , i 've only listened to one or two of his other works , and not very closely , so calling him a one-hit wonder has more to do with my exposure than my actual opinion of him over all ) . 
  i can not believe how far down the thread i had to go to find this . 
  why on earth are `` this is abusive and harmful '' and `` this contains private stuff '' on the first page ? 
  those hardly ever come up in practice . 
  meanwhile , the most common report reasons , the ones specified in the subreddit 's rules , are relegated to a second page . 
  i have a feeling we as mods are going to get a heap more low quality reports because users wo n't immediately see the correct report reasons , or will have to work harder to get to them . 
  the old system of subreddit rules at the top , site-wide rules in a single drop-down below that ( with `` spam '' as the default selection ) worked * perfectly * . 
  it was streamlined , efficient , and incredibly elegant . 
  why would you change that ? 
  i have no joke reported posts myself using an alt just to be able to make the report reasons show up again . 
  it 's insane that they are n't just always visible . 
   increase relevancy of reporting options : we hope you find the reports you receive more useful . 
  surely the change to make users click over to a second page to provide a report reason that 's based on the subreddit 's rules ( you know , the things that make up most non-spam reports ) is only going to decrease report relevancy ? 
  the old system was so elegant , with the sub 's rule-based reasons presented at the top , and the less common ones hidden away behind a drop down menu . 
  and all in one convenient page . 
  that does n't help . 
  ah right . 
  cheers . 
  \\ ^ this . 
  but also , even if it were true , mr alt 's claim of what mods desire is ridiculous . 
  call and mail and email ( all three are worth doing , but prioritise them in that order ) your state representative . 
  that 'll be a thousand times more effective than this petition . 
  good bot, 
  good bot, 
  good bot, 
   the czech republic, 
  just an fyi , they 've renamed themselves to czechia . 
  amazon owns twitch . 
  i do n't much like amazon either ( mainly because they do n't give a fuck about my country ) , but i 'd be much more happy to sign up using that account than forced to create a whole new account for a video game streaming service . 
  not to mention using amazon could allow them to integrate with the physical books better .

  there are a few things that can be prestige classes one chooses to become . 
  the only wizards-created prc is the runic mage , and that makes a lot of sense . 
  jono 's tinker is another good example . 
  yay !, 
  love when these stories have a happy ending !, 
   unless it 's all numbers , then it 's 10 ( ca n't use your phone number ), 
  but mobile phone numbers are 10 digits ? 
   and are n't all atm pins 4 digit numbers ? 
  yes .
