  movment should be free regardless of how much of your standard movement you use . 
  it should only come with a cost if you 're wanting to disengage or dash . 
  \\* sigh \\* i 'm honestly getting sick of explaining this every time someone new tries their hand at the initiative thing . 
  why is everyone trying to reinvent the wheel from scratch ? 
  you should be looking at previous attempts to do the same thing , and reading the feedback they received . 
  i 'm not aiming this specifically at you . 
  just ranting because i 'm sick of having to make the same damn comment over and over again because it seems nobody is looking at related content before making their own . 
   to start with the least fundamental change , mearls gives movement a cost ; angry does n't . 
  this is a mistake both in terms of gameplay and flavour . 
   for flavour , it means that you are only able to catch up with a retreating opponent if you specifically plan ahead to do so . 
  this does not match up with reality , where following an opponent on the move is perfectly instinctive to anyone with an ounce of training . 
   for gameplay , it means that if they are in melee with an opponent and that opponent decides to run away from them , they now can do literally nothing on their turn . 
  they chose to make a melee attack , but there is nobody in range . 
  and they are now being artificially restricted from moving to a target to attack them . 
  giving movement a cost creates a bad gameplay experience , * and * it does n't make sense in terms of in-world logic . 
  so the question then becomes why the hell * would * anyone include it ? 
  go out and send a physical letter to your own local member . 
  a phone call would also be really good . 
  emails are worth much more than an online petition , but still not a whole lot , especially if they 're not addressed from someone in the right electorate . 
  relevant username ? 
  but a cat in a box is not 90 kg . 
  also annerley and pullenvale are not 300 m apart . 
  what makes you think they are left handed ? 
  what makes you think a left handed person can only use their left hand to take photos ? 
  what makes you think this photo was taken using their right hand ? 
  the first one , i just do n't see any evidence for . 
  the second one i disagree with from personal experience . 
  the third i disagree with because looking at the reflection , it looks to me like it 's being held in the left hand . 
   added movement dice . 
  what . 
  why ? 
  your system was one of the only ones to make the right decision by * not * including that at first . 
   if we remove 1d6 to movement then why use this system at all ? 
  the onus is on people in favour of this system to find an answer to that . 
  but if i were to quickly posit one possibility , this system still allows varied cost for different actions . 
  spells are slower than daggers are slower than dodging , etc. 
   monks and rogues will go from being the most reactive to the least reactive class, 
  on the contrary , such a change favours rogues , who are often the * most * likely to use their movement . 
  move in , attack , retreat , in one turn . 
  if you have to spend something to move , this makes you slower . 
  if movement is free , this costs you nothing compared to a fighter who is only going to be moving if they are chasing a retreating enemy . 
   why did you comment if you did n't want to have a discussion ? 
  i do want to have a discussion . 
  but i also think that anyone sharing their own homebrew has an obligation to do it in an informed way . 
  posting something where there are literally * dozens * of other attempts at the same thing , without first at least * glancing * at those various other options , and the feedback they received , is poor form . 
  here are just a handful of the ones i found quickly through a search :, 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/6n5ijt/ok_my_turn_another_new_alternative_to_greyhawk/, 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/6fxm74/seize_the_initiative_essentials_rules_for_dynamic/, 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/6ctd54/initiative_modifiers/, 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/6el8td/speed_factor_20_a_variant_initiative_ruleset/, 
  and that 's just a few from this subreddit . 
  there have also been a heap in / r/dndnext and / r/mattcolville as well . 
  they 've been extremely popular for * months * now , since mearls first tweeted out a quick summary of his idea , and the pace of these posts has , if anything , only picked up since the ua article . 
   and who is angry and what does he have to do with this ? 
  i was copying and pasting from a previous comment i made . 
  angry is the angry dm , a really great blogger about dming in roleplaying games , and especially d&d . in particular , [ he wrote about a variable initiative system a long time ago ] ( http://theangrygm.com/fine-i-wrote-about-speed-factor-initiative-in-dd-5e/ ) which many have compared mearls ' new system to . 
  in short , it achieves the same beneficial things ( planning ahead , variation based on what you choose to do ) , while removing many of the negatives . 
  including no cost to movement and not messing with how initiative interacts with various other features of the game ( e.g. 
  * guidance * and jack of all trades ) . 
  here 's some more copy-paste from a different thread , for completeness :, 
   but introducing an entire new system has enormous problems with it . 
  it introduces questions of how various other ability in the game are meant to be affected . 
  how does guidance work now ? 
  can you apply bardic inspiration to your rolls ( and how would it work ? ) . 
  what about jack of all trades ? 
  it 's also going to be much slower , since instead of rolling one die and adding/subtracting some static numbers that can be worked out and known in advance , you have to first work out which various different dice you need to roll ( and how many ) , then roll them , then add them up . 
  it 's vastly slower than the angry system ; a slow down in addition to the difference between the angry system and the basic phb `` roll initiative only once at the start of each encounter '' system . 
   that last point might be a matter of taste . 
  maybe the slow down is a worthwhile trade for some people for some reason . 
  but vast changes to how a wide variety of other external abilities interact with something should only be done with extreme care , and i do n't think that mearls or colville have truly thought this through . 
  it can be done , but those proposing it need a really strong argument for each and every other ability that is being affected , and why they should be affected in the way it is . 
  the advantage of the angry system is that it is n't a complete overhaul of how initiative fundamentally works . 
  instead , it achieves the same end result as mearls ' system , but with less mechanical change . 
  and that is always a good thing . 
  0 and 2 are very good points . 
  4 is ... circumstantial . 
  sometimes that is a legitimate criticism , but sometimes not . 
  3 is also circumstantial , but is much more likely to be a legitimate criticism than 4 is . 
  something * should n't * step on the toes of existing material , in general . 
  there are a few subtle ways in which that can be done well , however .
