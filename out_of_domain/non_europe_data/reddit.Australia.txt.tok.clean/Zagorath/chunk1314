  oh yeah , the bin is on the right . 
  * wait how much am i pipetting ? 
  shit , got ta rotate the entire pipette and read this upside down . 
  * they put the warning label on the left hand side of the hood and now i have less space to write out my calculations . 
  * i have to put my pipette down to grab new samples because the ice box is on the left . 
  * i 've had to use scissors which is a crime in it of itself . 
  * seriously , how do i dispose of pipette tips ?? 
   ftfy, 
  yeah australian states are fucking huge . 
  if australian states and territories were to become states of the us , the rank would go, 
  queensland, 
  alaska, 
  northern territory, 
  south australia, 
  nsw, 
  texas, 
  california & ndash ; michigan, 
  victoria, 
  that 's right . 
  by australian standards , texas is a small state . 
  edit : just realised i was comparing us ** total ** area to australian ** land ** area . 
  victoria should have been ranked 16th , with california to oregon taking the spot above it , using land area for both . 
  it 's important to note that even though america and australia are roughly the same size ( if you ignore alaska ) , the scales of distances in australia do tend to be much larger in australia . 
  that 's because we 're one of the most centralised populations in the world . 
  just shy of 50 % of our population is in just the top three cities combined , and if you go to the top 6 cities , you get nearly 2/3 . 
  this means that there 's a fuckload less to see when driving between cities in australia than there is in america . 
  you go through a bunch of small towns if you 're driving down the east coast , but they 're very small places mostly . 
  and if you 're driving away from the east coast , it 's a fuckload of nothing whatsoever . 
  so driving these sorts of distances , especially if you * do * live in a country town , is completely the norm . 
  there 's a great series of novels set in australia , called the tomorrow series , which kinda explore this premise . 
  it 's not an apocalypse , it 's a foreign invasion , but it 's some people who are out in the country on a camping trip when it happens that are the main characters , and they end up becoming guerrilla warriors . 
  really great books . 
  made into a mediocre movie . 
  fuck yeah optus-selling mvnos are the bomb . 
  i used to be with vaya and they were great . 
  now with yomojo , also great . 
  anyway , i went from brisbane to newcastle and back twice this month , and the signal got very weak at a few places , but i never noticed it drop entirely . 
  on the other hand , i always lose signal between caboolture and beerwah , just north of brissy . 
  you 'll feel right at home . 
  they also have crap weather . 
  oii cunt . 
  we 're the smart state . 
  you can also often narrow down what country you 're in by seeing what side of the road you 're driving on ( based on where the signs are located ) . 
  left means britain , aus , or nz . 
  and if it 's aus , it 's pretty damn clear because of the environment . 
  you try being an l or p plater in nsw . 
  not allowed to go faster than 90 or 100 , respectively . 
  so fucking stupid and dangerous with everyone getting stuck behind you . 
  using land area :, 
  queensland, 
  alaska, 
  northern territory, 
  northwest territories, 
  south australia, 
  british columbia, 
  new south wales, 
  texas, 
  alberta, 
  i actually did canada 's provinces just a minute ago , if you look at the replies to my comment . 
  i 'm sure it 'll take up the first 5 spots or something on its own !, 
  / r/ofcoursethatsathing, 
  that 's what happens when you 're being hasty ( #treebeardwasright ) . 
  it 's hard comparing states and provinces from three different wikipedia pages by eye !, 
  slot alaska in just under queensland , before quebec . 
  yeah i just saw the list of all national subdivisions in the world someone posted below . 
  russia takes the number 1 and 3 spots , but then has no more until like 16 . 
  ninja edit : it 's 21 . 
  the third largest russian subdivision is the 21st largest subdivision in the world . 
  if only i had known about [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_country_subdivisions_by_area ) , it would have made things so much easier ...

  this submission is being removed . 
  you can set the text of your flair yourself . 
  see mine , 
  ninja edit : also , is n't alumnus singular masculine ? 
  alumna for feminine ? 
  i do n't know shit about latin though , so that 's just a guess . 
  read the above comment a little more carefully . 
  it might be something weird about the area the trains go through , i dunno . 
  i stopped way too early for that . 
  did n't even get to tassy . 
  yeah i was expecting wa , alaska , queensland , nt , south australia , texas , nsw . 
  was surprised qld beat alaska and nsw beat texas . 
  i did n't forget . 
  i stopped after things started getting too small to matter . 
  like tassy , act , and nearly 40 us states . 
  i did a search of the subreddit and only unanswered ones came up . 
  hmm , that does n't actually answer the question . 
  it just has the same information as know your meme . 
  stating irrelevant stuff about gangs , and then saying people use it to replace random letters . 
  my question is * why * people replace it with random letters . 
  well , that still does n't really answer it for me , but i kinda suspect there is n't a satisfying answer to the question , if it 's just all random weirdness . 
  thanks for the help . 
  that 's useful , except most of the way from brisbane to sydney is one lane each way , with like a 500 m long section with two lanes for overtaking every 5 k or so . 
  and then there 's the heavily laden trucks who go like 70 or less up hills that you got ta pass . 
  though those sections had three lanes each way so it 's not quite as bad .
