  art is a resource . 
  meta is for discussions about the subreddit . 
  i 've reflaired this for you , but in the future please remember this distinction . 
  legally , these can be used in * any * work published on the dungeon master 's guild . 
  free or paid . 
  but they can not be used , legally , on works published elsewhere , regardless of whether they are free or not . 
  this subreddit 's rules only require that credit be given , so as long as you do that , we 're okay with you posting on this subreddit . 
  the most desired include :, 
  * upgrade the centenary motorway, 
  * st lucia -- west end ( ironic , considering [ an earlier article ] ( http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/council-anger-as-uq-plans-new-bridge-to-west-end-20170313-gux1o8.html ) where the council was angry at uq for planning such a bridge ), 
  * wilson triple jump, 
  bloody poms . 
  hey guys , why has there been no response to the criticism that this supposed `` streamlining '' of reports actually makes reporting much less convenient , thus making it less likely that we as mods are going to get useful information out of them ? 
  5 clicks minimum to report a post for breaking normal rules is insane . 
  what 's the justification for this ? 
  bad bot, 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  per rule # 1 , this post is being removed . 
  you might try searching the sub with different keywords , or searching previous arcana forge threads . 
  if that fails , consider asking in the latest arcana forge thread . 
  best of luck . 
  no , but you will need to plan ahead and sell your arm , possibly also your leg , to afford the trip from the airport into the city . 
  they tried doing it at a time that would have minimal impact on people , and that did n't work . 
  blame the council , or whoever it is that 's responsible for screwing them over to make them need to go on strike . 
  this time they 're doing it to have maximal effect , for the amount of time the strike is going to last . 
  that includes forcing parents to make alternative arrangements for their kids .

  prestige classes already have a set of rules for 5e . 
  but epic levels do not . 
  so if you are going to create one , you need to have some text explaining the basic way in which epic levels in general function . 
  i use my location history all the time . 
  what was the name of that restaurant i really liked that we went to last week ? 
  what dates did we spend in [ other city ] ? 
  where exactly did we stop for a rest on the long interstate drive two weeks ago ? 
  these are all things that i have used it for in the last month alone . 
  it 's so incredibly useful . 
  coles ads grate on me so much that i 've resolved to shop literally anywhere else just because of how fucking annoying their ads are . 
  netflix does some interesting stuff with their media streaming tech . 
  interesting , but definitely not good . 
  it connects you to what it thinks is the best cdn when you first start , and it tries to stream at the best quality . 
  however , if the connection between you and it drops , it will stay connected to the same cdn until it literally can not stream at any quality any more . 
  it 'll keep reducing the quality you get served in order to do so . 
  [ this diagram should help demonstrate it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydtpt0z.png ) . 
  it 's not a huge problem since most of the time the connection will slow down as a result of user 's bandwidth . 
  but if a particular server is under heavy load or a user 's connection to a particular cdn is otherwise slowed down , it 's a problem . 
   for the common man, 
  as in , tesla cars are crazy expensive . 
  perhaps , but there 's a noticeable difference between a low level of * discourse * and a problem communicating due to not speaking the language well . 
  i would have thought lutwyche to aspley would be more useful . 
  my experience is that chermside and kedron are the worst . 
  yeah i was pretty astonished by that list . 
  though wa is just slightly under a third of australia 's land area . 
   it 's a series of three bridges that adds an east-west bus , bicycle and pedestrian link between the cbd and the kangaroo point , new farm and bulimba peninsulas .

  i 'm removing this post , but hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !,
