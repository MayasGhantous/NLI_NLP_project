  it is honestly astonishing that we do n't already have a pedestrian/cycle route that can take you from uq to kangaroo point , along the river . 
  would n't really matter which side it was on . 
  does n't need to be both sides , although that 'd be an extra bonus .

  best of luck . 
  i do think that throne would be * better * , but not by much . 
  `` seat '' , to me , sounds even better ( using definition 1a from [ this page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/seat#noun ) , specifically the `` also '' part ) , but still not quit perfect . 
  i 'd suggest accompanying the next repost of this with a specific request for comments on what the subclass should be called . 
  but for now , personally , the best i can think of is seat . 
  this certainly is really cool because of the look and character of it , but in case you are n't already aware , you can get basically any classical music for free , completely legally , on [ imslp ] ( http://imslp.org/ ) . 
  only got ta print it out yourself . 
   i regret much more not having an sd card reader inside the mac and having to use an external reader, 
  i personally do n't see this as an issue , mainly because the sd card readers i 've had built in to macs in the past have been utter shite . 
  they work okay for a couple of months after purchase , and then just ... stop . 
  i would ** love ** the sd card slot if it worked properly . 
  but why keep a port that most users are n't ever going to use , and which fails really easily even on the users who do use it ? 
   and removed another potential point of failure, 
  more like constant , in my experience . 
  what makes neo better than etherium ? 
  remember that the word count is a maximum , and it 's not unusual , especially in a maths ee , to be substantially underneath it .

  bus drivers are striking because they face danger in the workplace and their employers are refusing to spend money to upgrade their safety . 
  you realise that fewer buses on the road means more cars , right ? 
  even if every car carried two or three people ( most do n't ) , a bus still takes up far less space to carry more people . 
  bad bot, 
   this point is not being adequately put forward in the media, 
  for real . 
  i had no idea until reading this that it was about safety . 
  i assumed they wanted more pay . 
  i mean , i was still on their side even with that assumption , but knowing it 's about safety makes me even more sympathetic to their plight . 
   i 'm not one to help generation snowflake, 
  not even worth reading beyond this point , to be honest . 
  right there it became quite apparent just how out of touch with reality you are . 
  it 's an optional rule , as others have said . 
  and , as others have said , it does n't work well , as written , in 5e . 
  it makes advantage too easy to get , which devalues other sources of advantage immensely . 
  this is not the fault of the flanking rule . 
  it 's the fault of how movement in combat works in 5e . 
  specifically , the fact that you can literally run in circles around people , and that still does not provoke opportunity attacks . 
  there are two possible solutions to this , if you * do * want the tactical interest and the realism that having flanking provides :, 
  * fix how movement works . 
  make it so that moving more than 5 feet in one turn , within range of an enemy , provokes an opportunity attack . 
  * make flanking a static bonus . 
  +1 or +2 to hit . 
  both of these have their own advantages and disadvantages . 
  fixing movement could cause confusion with some players , and also arguably slows down the game . 
  the static bonus creates additional maths for players , and also makes it able to stack with advantage if they have a source of it , which increases chance to hit * immensely * . 
  so was the ring !, 
  a similar thing happened last federal election in australia . 
  one of the tv channels ' politics presenters was the subject of a bet over what colour his tie would be . 
  he ended up deliberately changing ties multiple times throughout the night just to fuck with them . 
  i do n't think i heard anything more about it since the day after the election , but my recollection is that the betting company ended up having to pay * everyone * out . 
  amusing , and will hopefully teach them not to make such stupid bets in the future . 
  although on the other hand it might have been worth it to them for the publicity . 
  i dunno the stats on it . 
   a legitimate bet should be such that even if the object of the bet is trying to do one thing , they could still fail, 
  i fully agree . 
  in peak hours , near major roads and the city ? 
  that never happens . 
  everything you just described are things 5e does worse than older editions . 
  you can not safely back off just 5 feet . 
  you * can * run literal circles around an opponent , safely . 
  you can , depending on circumstances , run quite a significant distance between two enemies without provoking an oa . 
  in 4e , moving more than 5 ft within range of an enemy provoked oa . 
  you * can * back off safely . 
  clearly more verisimilitude in that . 
  * it arbitrarily will just choose not to show the predictions in some environments , including when doing searches on google . 
  also when searching for apps in the play store . 
  * it requires a really long press and hold on keys to get at symbols underneath them , instead of being able to click , hold , and drag in the required direction all in one smooth , quick , motion . 
  * even when you do long press and hold , its range of recommendations are very limited . 
  long press on d does n't give , for example , '' \u0111 '' . 
  in fact , it does n't give anything . 
  * it does n't add a space automatically after commas , full stops , and other punctuation . 
  gboard is a load of unusable crap compared to swiftkey . 
  and somehow when using ** google 's own apps ** ( like search and the play store ) , the gap between the keyboards widens even further in favour of swiftkey . 
  i got `` i hate bards in 5e '' ( `` in '' and `` 5e '' being the next two centre suggestions , not all in a single suggestion ) . 
  because fuck bards in d&d 5th edition . 
  they make no fucking sense .
