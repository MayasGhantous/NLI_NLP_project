  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly .

  i think [ this page ] ( https://thingsaussieslike.wordpress.com/speaking-aussie-style-2/ ) most accurately represents how the word `` cheeky '' is used in aussie slang . 
  there certainly are a lot more spammy bots out there recently . 
  that drunk animal fact one , for example . 
  who the fuck thought that was a good idea ? 
  but on the other hand , i 've seen a lot of places , including / r/botbust , which go ** way ** too far in the other direction , and ban a lot of extremely useful bots . 
  quite sadly , recently [ one of the most useful bots on reddit ] ( / r/tometric ) seems to have died , possibly with its creator 's account being hijacked . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  bad bot, 
  that 's such a dumb set of rules though , because a lot of the most useful bots * by necessity * violate them . 
  the tometric bot , the youtube facts bot ( albeit we only need * one * , not the three or so that currently exist ) , the wiki bot , etc. 
  all work because they are providing a useful service to people based on the context of some very common keywords , which helps provide context for the thread , without needing to leave for another site , and which the comment they are replying to usually has failed to provide . 
  it 's unfortunate that some of the most spammy bots * also * violate these same rules , but we should n't throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
  we already have it in australia and nz . 
  i think there 's one other country with it , too . 
  not sure . 
  or , if i * do * need a website , why not do it myself ? 
  that 's a fantastic idea . 
  shame the product your shitty ad is for ** is n't ** doing it yourself , despite the ad 's shitty claim to the contrary . 
  more amusingly , its binomial name is * pseudorca crassidens * . 
  as in `` false orca '' . 
  the expression is * could n't * care less . 
  as in the current amount of care is zero . 
  anyway , yeah , i have n't got youtube red , but looking at trailers and free first episodes of some of the exclusive series , 95 % of it looks like utter shite . 
  i would n't mind watching kedi though , that looks like a fun time . 
  kiwis have it too . 
  [ korea and mexico , are also on the lucky list ] ( https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6307365?hl=en ) . 
  yeah i just looked it up . 
  [ both korea and mexico are also on the lucky list ] ( https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6307365?hl=en ) . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  if content is detected on youtube , the owners ( or alleged owners , as the case has more often been in my own experience ) can choose between, 
  * take it down, 
  * monetise ( and the owner of the detected content gets 100 % of the user 's cut -- the uploader gets nothing ), 
  * mute the whole video ( if the content detected is audio ), 
  * do nothing, 
  it 's up to them which they go with . 
  most , outside of germany , seem to go with monetise it . 
  but they can have it taken down if they prefer . 
  and duo . 
  and also have a web version of allo , and let me use my google account as my allo id , and not a phone number . 
  the remind me bot needs to be specifically called out , using a phrase that people would not normally use . 
  youtube bots respond automatically to any youtube link , wikipedia ones to any wikipedia link , and the old metric one ( before it sadly died ) would respond to any comment that uses the old archaic measurements . 
  things that people are using without expecting a bot to respond , but which nevertheless are improved by the bot being there . 
  as someone who 's done some amateur dping , \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  i found it super easy . 
  clicked the link , made the pinch gesture , and the image popped out perfectly . 
  i was expecting it to be a pain , but it was actually designed way better than imgur 's album pages . 
  i reckon we should take a page out of the uk 's books , and let commonwealth citizens who are legal permanent residents of australia stand for parliament . 
   the non-english speaking world calls it `` orca '' . 
  so do more educated english speakers . 
  anyway , the name killer whale actually comes from the fact that they kill whales . 
  orca are in the family delphinidae ( as in dolphins ) , and they have been seen preying on much larger non-dolphin whales . 
  so they 're a dolphin that kills whales . 
  a whale killer . 
  the name was a mistranslation of this . 
  turns out it 's two other countries ( korea and mexico ) , but yeah . 
  this is a really bizarre rare case of us getting new tech really early . 
  that did n't even occur to me . 
  maybe that 's why op used dop instead . 
  it 's director of photography . 
  what app are you using ? 
  is it ? 
  i honestly do n't know , because i 've never used allo , because fuck messenger apps that use phone number as id without using sms . 
  at the ** very ** least , new zealand , our closest allies and friends , should be on the list . 
  preferably the entire commonwealth . 
  it 's not like it 's some arbitrary list made out of nowhere . 
  it 's based on a diplomatic group that we are already a part of , consisting of countries with a common history to us . 
  point 2 can not . 
  or at least i could find no way to do it . 
  you can shorten the press taken to count as a long press , but that 's very different from swiftkey 's system , which allow a click and drag with zero delay , if it starts on the full stop , which allows instantaneous access to comma , exclamation mark , and question mark . 
  meanwhile you can keep the long press length on other keys to be a comfortable long press time . 
  but anyway , point 1 is the worst . 
  that on its own is a complete deal breaker . 
  why the fuck would google disable auto suggestions in their own keyboard , on their own flagship product ? 
  ebay used to use it , but recently decided to disable totp in favour of sms-based otps . 
  i said fuck that and disabled my 2fa on ebay out of protest . 
  i mean , sms 2fa is better than no 2fa , for sure . 
  but it 's so much worse than time based that using totp is a no brainier decision . 
  so i turned it off in protest . 
  not like i 've got much to lose anyway . 
  it 's only ebay . 
  wait for real ? 
  how is it gon na work ? 
  could this solve the problem that bluetooth currently has , which makes it vastly inferior to 3.5 mm , that switching bluetooth headphones from your phone to your laptop to your desktop is a massive pain in the arse compared to unplugging and plugging in a cable ? 
  i find this with a lot of modern educational shows aimed at a younger ( but not child ) audience . 
  most of the time i find the story , largely due to overacting and ridiculous scripting , gets in the way of the actual knowledge . 
  we have a show in australia called the checkout , which serves to teach people about consumer rights , in a very similar way to how are teaches common misconceptions .
