  a message saying it ca n't do online play . 
  fuck that shitty company , and fuck that shitty store . 
  tl ; dr walked a long way to buy a game i already owned just so i could play online , it did n't allow online play . 
  i 've got two , one that i refuse to ever pay for again , and one that i will look very closely at the competition before buying anything from them , unless they take corrective action . 
  first , ** ubisoft ** , though i 'll happily pirate their games because seriously they 're awesome . 
  last time i paid for a game for myself in a physical store , it was because i wanted a copy of age of mythology to play online . 
  i could have pirated it , but i loved playing online so i wanted to buy it legally . 
  i had a proper copy of the gold edition for ages , but my disk broke so i had to get another one . 
  i walk into an eb games ( huge game store in australia , and another company that will not be getting my business ) , and ask about it ( it 's not on shelves , as this happened in 2007/8 , a long time after the game was out ) , they send me to the other eb games in the same shopping centre , who then sends me half way across the city to get it at another eb games . 
  after walking the entire way there ( the next bus would 've been ages and i did n't have a car ) , i get my copy of the gold edition ( though it looks kinda odd , more like it has both the vanilla game and the expansion , rather than the `` gold edition '' per se ) and walk out . 
  it turns out this version of age of mythology was published by ubisoft , for some reason . 
  i walk out and head to the nearest bus stop . 
  while waiting for a bus , i read the back of the box , and what does it have , in tiny fine print near the bottom ?

  second , ** samsung ** , although i 've never bought one of their products deliberately ( they may have been the manufacturer of some part or other in a computer or device from another company ) , but i wo n't be buying from them after [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  for context , this guy is one of my favourite youtubers , and his reviews of phones and cameras ( and the cameras on phones ) are some of the best i 've ever seen . 
  i wo n't definitely say i will never buy i samsung product , and if samsung clearly is the best in field for what i 'm looking for , by a large margin , i 'll still go with them . 
  however , it made me seriously want to take a second look at what smartphone to get . 
  i was going to get a galaxy s3 , but decided to look at alternatives because of this . 
  when the nexus 4 came out , it was the clear choice and i think i would 've gone with it regardless , but this certainly made my decision easier . 
  tl ; dr watch the video . 
  i 've got a bunch of reasons to disagree with you , but i 'm exhausted from a different comment thread and ca n't be arsed to have the conversation . 
  instead , because many people see it as being apple vs. samsung so much , i 'll say why samsung has lost any potential ( deliberate ) business from me . 
  although i 've never bought one of their products deliberately ( they may have been the manufacturer of some part or other in a computer or device from another company ) , i wo n't be buying from them after [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) .

  i do n't have an android device ( yet ) , but i was mainly talking about on the computer , anyway . 
  thanks , though . 
  ah alright , that 's bizarre , really , but thanks . 
  i 've been searching around trying to find the full video ( hence i 've landed on this month-old post ) , but ca n't seem to find it anywhere . 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.cus.org/connect/debates/2011/this-house-believes-that-classical-music-is-irrelevant-to-todays-youth ) to the actual cambridge page for the debate , but i ca n't actually find the video on the page anywhere ... 
  i 'm an abachiest . 
   there might be a built in feature in ps that does this kind of thing, 
  there may , but since you 've mentioned it , there are definitely apps for phones that can do this , and i believe a fair few point 'n' shoot cameras do this kind of thing , too . 
  some of my favourite beethoven ones :, 
  * beethoven can write music , thank god , but he can do nothing else on earth . 
  * music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy . 
  * what you are , you are by accident of birth ; what i am , i am by myself . 
  there are and will be a thousand princes ; there is only one beethoven . 
  in order of least favourite to most favourite . 
  i love beethoven 's politics . 
  eb is the second best key . 
  the best is c minor . 
  it 's object fact . 
   i will prevail, 
  eric whitacre, 
  some of the best `` last words '' i could find . 
  take all of these with a grain of salt , because as abe lincoln said , anybody can lie on the internet :, 
  * `` night shines deeper , to penetrate more deeply , but yet within there glows bright light . 
  for completing of the greatest work , one soul for a thousand suffices . '', 
  * `` how lovely . 
  this belongs to me , it is my home '' -- stravinsky, 
  * `` i am fond of them , of the inferior beings of the abyss , of those who are full of longing '' -- wagner, 
  * `` at last , they are going to play my music '' -- berlioz, 
  * `` is this perhaps death ? '', 
  * `` no more '' -- chopin, 
  \\* not actually last words , but the last line of his final song, 
  hey do n't blame me . 
  i was asleep the whole time . 
  i agree , most of these are probably made up . 
  but i 'm not sure i agree that it 's wrong to pretend . 
  i do n't exactly remember , but i think someone from nobility probably said something about how beethoven was a commoner . 
  you do know that you spelt your theres incorrectly , right ? 
  or was that the point ? 
  ^ why facebook is still more popular than google +, 
  i disagree . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion , of course , but just keep in mind it 's just that , an opinion . 
  i prefer skype for im because it has a much nicer , cleaner , interface . 
  that said , i do fucking hate how it treats offline messages . 
  the direct connections skype uses in favour of connecting via a server are a huge advantage for the video stuff , but with ims it becomes a pain , as you ca n't send offline messages . 
  only other issue i have is the way every device you have skype on has to sync up all the recent conversations automatically . 
  i 'd prefer it to sync them directly into history so they show up when i ask to search convo history but not otherwise . 
  uhh ... it does it automatically . 
  check your preferences , but mine logs all my chat forever . 
  you can set it to delete after a while , too . 
  only problem is it wo n't transfer your history to other devices . 
  just a tip , in english the `` a vs. an '' is based not on what letter the next word starts on , but on what * sound * it starts with . 
  because european starts with a `` y '' sound , we say `` a european '' . 
  similarly , some words starting with consonants start with a vowel sound , so we use `` an hour '' , for example . 
  that was beautiful . 
  i do n't agree with a lot of it , but wow it was beautiful . 
  then blame the im client and push them to add skype . 
  this is honestly the main reason i * do n't * use a unified client like pidgin . 
  none of them seem to have skype functionality . 
  in highschool ( i graduated may 2012 ) all the friends i regularly talked to were on skype , and occasionally other people would contact me on facebook . 
  i 'm still in regular contact with a few of them through skype . 
  i 'm really hoping that at my uni ( start next month ) the norm is n't facebook , but judging by what my friends in australia seem to be using , facebook is incredibly popular for iming . 
  false analogies are an incredibly common form of argument , but this one was quite possibly the worst . 
  it does n't even pretend to make sense . 
  this does n't have enough motion blur . 
  i can still make out the words . 
  ah , right . 
  clever reference . 
  but you still used it as an analogy , by saying that was similar to attributing quotes to famous people without reliable sources . 
  what ?
