  it 's not in our rules . 
  it 's just that reddit itself has some bizarre arcane rules as to what it permits and does n't , and we have no way of knowing why something was banned , even as subreddit moderators . 
  it 's actually available for free on sbs viceland and sbs on demand , starting next tuesday , at least according to the ad i just saw . 
  only a few weeks behind the us , which is a lot better than the multiple months some other shows are . 
  [ it 's actually the law .

   when you ride , you must : not overtake another vehicle on the left if that vehicle is indicating and turning left, 
  edit : on second thought , the comment is unclear . 
  / u/ps _ abbrev might have been going right or straight at the roundabout . 
  in that case , the cyclist was doing something legal , but certainly unnecessarily risky . 
  though at the same time , the driver * should * be sticking to his line , so the cyclist * should * be safe . 
  when i 'm riding , `` should '' is n't good enough for me , and i always choose the more cautious option . 
  i thought the initial tackle was fine . 
  his arm was down at around hip height ; only reason it got him in the head was because of how far he was leaning at the time . 
  but that second one , when he was already on the ground , was ridiculous . 
  he did n't just fall down onto him , he fully lead in with the shoulder and forced it down into his face . 
   his arm was n't in a fist and pearson slipping was the reason it was high . 
  yeah definitely . 
  his arm would have been at hip height if pearson had been standing straight . 
  it 's that second hit , when he was already down on the ground , where eels number 15 charged his shoulder down into him , that * should * have been on report . 
  spell slots always follow exactly one of three progressions . 
  full spell casters ( e.g. 
  wizard , sorcerer , cleric ) , half casters ( paladin , ranger ) , and third casters ( eldritch knight , arcane trickster ) . 
  you ca n't just make up some other weird combination .

  is quiz meisters the one that the re in toowong used to put on ? 
  i 've been trying to remember what it was called when i went to it around this time last year . 
  it was a great quiz . 
  went again a few weeks ago , and it was run by a bunch called `` innquizative '' , and it was utter shite . 
  90 % was bullshit pop culture stuff -- movies , music , celebs . 
  i 've been struggle to remember what the company that used to run it was , and quiz meisters sounds vaguely familiar ... 
  on a mac ? 
  option-l ( that 's lower case l ) . 
   not sure about other countries, 
  has n't been on australian netflix for ages , sadly . 
  in australia , we call both of them chips !, 
  because fuck logic . 
  maccas might call them fries wherever you go , but people do not . 
  in australia , new zealand , and the british isles , they 're called `` chips '' . 
  the thing served with fish is also called chips . 
  it 's like subway serving `` footlong '' sandwiches in australia , despite us literally never using the term `` foot '' otherwise . 
  it 's a part of their branding , and has nothing to do with what the words actually mean locally . 
  i go to maccas and i order a `` regular chips '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure the proper nomenclature would be `` medium fries '' , but fuck that . 
  they understand what i 'm talking about , and i 'm not gon na use some american term just because . 
  indeed , i 'm a staunch republican , but my preference is quite strongly for a model with as little change as possible . 
  i do n't even want our head of state to have the title president , since that carries the baggage of an implied politicised powerful position . 
  i 'd like our governor general to be chosen de jure the way it is already chosen de facto , and for the gg to be directly our head of state . 
  zero real change , but our government no longer derives its authority from a foreigner . 
  a lot of people are providing you with concrete answers to the question of how the gg will be chosen . 
  the only correct answer is `` it depends on what people vote for '' . 
  this first vote will be a simple in principle yes or no . 
  if it passes , there will be another vote to decide which model is preferred . 
  then , that chosen model will , in a third vote , go up against the current model . 
  strictly speaking , only the third vote will constitutionally require a double majority ( majority of people in a majority of states , plus a majority overall ) to pass . 
  the others could be a simple majority . 
  though i do n't know whether shorten will do it in that way , or whether he will also require the in principle vote obtain a double majority . 
  is this including cost to the economy of workers who have to take time off sick ? 
  or just sheer upfront healthcare costs ? 
  americans call jam `` jelly '' . 
  i think they call jelly `` jello '' . 
  i choose to believe copacity means capacity for copying . 
  feel free to ask around for ideas in the arcana forge , but all posts have to have homebrew that is at least complete in terms of material presented even if its not balanced or fleshed out . 
  this post does n't have homebrew that is fleshed out enough to be a post of its own on unearthed arcana , so i am removing it . 
  the top 10 cities , sydney , melbourne , brisbane , perth , adelaide , gold coast -- tweed heads , newcastle -- maitland , canberra -- queanbeyan , sunshine coast , and wollongong , make up 72.52 % of the population . 
  you 're right about the first 5 being nearly 2/3 the population , but the next 5 have * already * dropped down to really quite small cities , accounting for less than 10 percent between them . 
  your main point is correct . 
  in fact if anything it 's more correct than you thought , because australia 's population is basically 5 cities . 
  maybe 6 so we can count canberra for the pollies and other government agencies . 
  it becomes * even more * significant if you think about how many people commute from sunshine or gold coasts , or ipswich , to brisbane , as well as sydney and melbourne 's satellite cities . 
  hey i 've reflaired this for you as `` item '' . 
  the resource flair is for resources to aid others in creating their own homebrew . 
  hey i 've reflaired this for you as `` adventure '' , since it seems to be essentially a narrative element that can be incorporated . 
  the resource flair is for resources to aid others in creating their own homebrew . 
  unlikely that that 's the case , when 5 different places all gave the same excuse on the same night . 
  sometimes you just have to fork so you can make children . 
  but when you 're finished with them , and kill them , you need to make sure you reap the child , otherwise it might become a zombie . 
  based on / u/spaceblubian 's comment , i do n't think it works that way . 
  can i take it on a train ? 
  and 18 and two 17s since level 1 ? 
  daym , nice . 
  anyway , with those stats i 'd go for a feat without a second thought . 
  a half feat to put a point into wis to improve your spells , or con to improve your hp and concentration would be great . 
  war caster 's biggest advantage is giving advantage on concentration , but you might also find the other two features worthwhile . 
  however , resilient ( con ) will give you +3 to concentration immediately , and an additional +1 once you reach level 5 . 
  plus , an immediate +4 hp boost , and an extra +1 for each subsequent level . 
  you also get that +3 / 4 bonus to any non-concentration constitution saving throws . 
  advantage is worth approximately +5 * if * you need to roll 11 on the die to pass .
