  not in this country . 
  anyone got experience booking an uber for the early hours of the morning ? 
  the ** very ** early hours . 
  the app itself says it `` does n't guarantee '' that the booking will be fulfilled , but it also does n't seem to give any feedback on whether or not someone has accepted it . 
  i 'll pipe in and say i would not either . 
  but i also have no interest in it even if it were free . 
  the idea of gaming in public just seems foreign to me . 
  you left out cricket . 
  although in that case at least , our men are n't exactly languishing , they 're just not number 1 . 
  ( 2 in odis , 3 in test . ), 
  not sure how i came across this thread a month late , but i 'm here , so ... 
  yeah , rugby league is ** by far ** a bigger sport in australia than rugby union . 
  union here is essentially a failed sport at this point . 
   a single , scandinavian tear, 
  is that a tear which immediately turns to ice ? 
  what was that penalty for ? 
  edit : also , what happened to my flair ? 
  i used to have a different one ... 
  i feel much the same way about * soccer * as i do about rugby union . 
  it 's a great sport at lower levels , but for a variety of reasons , the top level mens ' sport is just crap . 
  in soccer it 's diving and players being fucking wooses . 
  in union it 's overzealous referees blowing the whistle every three minutes , and players deliberately exploiting loopholes in the rules ( e.g. , collapsing scrums to force a tap ) . 
  i honestly had no idea why people liked union at all , until i went to watch a lower grade game for the first time , just a year or so ago . 
  and suddenly it clicked . 
  the sport is n't the problem , the refs and players at top-grade are . 
  similarly , i 've found soccer is fun to play , and at least part of the reason that watching it is so fucking awful is the players flopping or whining over what would , in other sports , be considered a minor injury . 
  i 've only seen a small amount of womens ' and lower-grade soccer , but i imagine that they are far better . 
  i mean , me too . 
  but i 'm not sure why that 's relevant to * anything * . 
  yeah i 've scheduled the ride . 
  i just wanted clarification that there 'd be drivers available at that time , since the app does n't give any indication that the trip has been accepted or whatever . 
  cheers for the reassurance . 
  seems to me like that defeats the point of scheduling trips . 
  but thanks for the clarification . 
   i do n't know what a school tuckshop is, 
  mate . 
  that 's unaustralian . 
  it 's what schools in other countries would call a school cafeteria or school canteen . 
  shit 's creeping in from europe to . 
  the amount of aussies who think they 're playing `` football '' with a spherical ball now is insulting . 
  i would go there and ask them to precisely explain what the wage gap means . 
  if they get it right , i 'd pay it . 
  if they claim the wage gap is `` women get paid less for doing the same job '' , then i would refuse . 
  i strongly suspect it would be the latter . 
  you ca n't `` explain away '' the gap , because the things causing it -- things like women being more likely to go into lower paying fields , being less likely to go for promotion or ask for a wage increase , women being less likely to be employed in some higher paying fields when they * do * apply , and women being less likely to he approved for promotion or wage increase when they apply -- are all very real problems that need to be addressed . 
  some of them are ultimately down to the woman 's decision , but that decision is made with two decades of being a part of a culture that pushes them ( sometimes subtly , sometimes explicitly ) in a certain direction . 
  and other parts of the problem are out of the woman 's hands , being the fault solely of those responsible for employing and promoting them . 
  it 's certainly * not * the same as `` women get paid less for the same job '' . 
  and it frustrates me to no end that so many feminists frame it that way -- including this caf\u00e9 . 
  but it * is * still a problem that society needs to work towards fixing . 
  also, 
  * if you have/are going to have children who ca n't be vaccinated for weeks/months after birth . 
  can i ask a completely off topic question ? 
  are you french ? 
  just asking because the use of `` an hex ... '' rather than `` a hex ... '' , and the space before question marks and some other punctuation , make it seem like you might be french . 
  spectacular camera . 
  superb battery life . 
  that sweet , sweet true android experience . 
  ( sans the crap other companies put on their phones , and with timely updates . ), 
  google assistant . 
  to me , yeah , it 's definitely worth it . 
  i 'm pretty sure it did . 
  it was n't for me , but my parents . 
  and since i did n't get woken up to help them figure out how to book a taxi instead , i 'm assuming it worked . 
  wha the stats represent between 3rd and 5th has changed , thanks to bounded accuracy . 
  their in-lore level of intelligence may not have changed , only the way their stats represent that . 
   people who want to play psionic crystal people, 
  is this really a pre-existing desire ? 
  my first self-built character was a shardmind , but it 's because i read through the phbs and thought `` yeah , this looks like a really cool race with some great lore behind it '' . 
  but if you had asked me beforehand what type of character i wanted to play , i would never in a million years have said `` psionic crystal person '' . 
  +1 for mentioning my favourite 4e race , the vryloka !, 
  [ here 's an adaptation i made of them for 5e ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) . 
  but anyway , i find it vaguely amusing that you mentioned them as a compromise for vampires . 
  i mean , they obviously * are * that , but at the same time , they were introduced * in the same book * as where you actually * were * able to play a vampire , as a class . 
  i also want to point out that , canonically , like 99 % of tieflings are infernal , not abyssal . 
  they have devil blood running through them , not demon . 
  prior to 4e this was not the case , but some events which took place between 3.5 e and 4e caused massive changes in the tiefling population , and meant that at the time , * all * tieflings were infernal . 
  more recently , it seems that some new tiefling bloodlines have been created which are based on demon , yugoloth , succubus , rakshasa , etc. 
  blood . 
  i was pretty neutral on dragonborns and tieflings originally . 
  i did n't hate them like a lot of people seem to , but i did n't particularly like them either .
