  then i read the brimstone angels series , by erin m. evans . 
  and holy shit now i absolutely adore both races . 
   their ancestors were granted demonic power by asmodeus, 
  first , it 's * devilish * power , not demonic . 
  asmodeus being a devil , not a demon . 
  second , a cambion is the child of basically * any * devil and a human . 
  tieflings are n't direct children , they 're humans whose blood has been in some way * tainted * by fiends . 
  ( i do n't think what this specifically means has been stated anywhere . ), 
  third , demonic tieflings * do * exist , they 're just exceedingly rare . 
  prior to asmodeus 's apotheosis ( which happened near the beginning of the centuries long gap between 3.5 e and 4e ) , there was a lot of variety in tieflings . 
  ones based on devil , demon , rakshasa , yugoloth , and other bloodlines . 
  the ritual which made asmodeus a god , however , involved thirteen tieflings of different bloodlines , and it transformed * all * tieflings in existence into ones based on asmodeus 's bloodline . 
  that 's why tieflings today almost all have horns , a tail , solid-coloured orbs for eyes , and skin ranging from standard caucasian pinkish with a slight reddish hue , to full on red . 
  but the game has released stats for tieflings that are abyssal , and this causes a conundrum with the lore . 
  there has been no official explanation of how an abyssal tiefling could possibly exist . 
  but the consensus seems to be that in the time * since * the toril thirteen performed their ritual , any * new * tiefling bloodlines which have been created could be bloodlines in the same style as prior to the ritual . 
  so while all bloodlines that already existed look the same , new ones are n't necessarily . 
  lawful evil is objectively the best narrative alignment . 
  and i will fight anyone who claims otherwise . 
   it 's the edgy af dragon and demon races, 
  devil . 
  the vast majority of tieflings , including ** all ** tieflings using the phb stats , are based on devilish blood . 
   i have npcs now have serious negative reaction to races like tieflings . 
  good !, 
  that 's sort of the point . 
  that because of their devilish looks ( in a literal sense ... ) , they get heavily persecuted , despite * not * actually having any natural inclination towards evil . 
  and yet , because of how they 're treated , many tieflings * do * turn towards evil . 
   then 4e came along and threw subtlety out the god damn window . 
  if you really think that , i would urge you to read the brimstone angels series . 
  not only does it give you the really fascinating explanation for precisely what happened between 3.5 e and 4e to make tieflings different , it demonstrates what tieflings are really like in the current lore that makes them an * incredibly * compelling race . 
  i suspect dragonborn might be highly competitive for that title , if the elder scrolls universe did n't have an entirely different meaning for the word . 
  seriously . 
  with characters in fiction like dracula , darth vader , lex luthor , darkseid , don corleone , tywin lannister , and the devil himself ( or more accurately , literary depictions of him ) being so incredibly popular and compelling , there 's just no competition . 
  vryloka vampire with vampiric heritage : 175 % vamp . 
  i think there might even be more options available . 
  not sure . 
   most people would just say `` demon '' in reference to any sort of evil incarnate , which is funny , because you 'd be more likely to be a devil if you were to play either . 
  yeah , it 's a pet peeve of mine in this subreddit and other d&d communities . 
  devils and demons are so completely opposed to one another that confusing the two is ridiculous to me . 
  and devils are ** so ** much more * compelling * than demons could ever hope to be . 
  not even close . 
  he 's weak as ** fuck ** , and has basically no principles . 
  but he 's not a moron , and he 's not evil . 
  for reference , he 's the leader of our right wing party , but he probably could have joined our left wing party and done quite well for himself . 
  he 's relatively centrist . 
  he got started in politics as the leader of the republican movement , and he 's pushed in the past for climate change prevention methods , and he believes in marriage equality . 
  unfortunately for him , his position as leader of the party is balanced on a knife-edge . 
  the religious extreme right is firmly against marriage equality , does n't believe in climate change , and is staunchly pro monarchy . 
  the marriage equality issue especially is tearing the party in half . 
  turnbull refuses to do anything for the good of the country because he 's terrified he 'll lose his position . 
  i always downvote any comment which contains no description of why a particular game or set of games is a good fit . 
  does n't matter if i like the game ( s ) or not . 
  if you do n't explain why they 're good games , it 's not constructive to the conversation and should n't be there . 
  unfortunately , this subreddit 's mods have added the `` botbust '' bot , which removes a whole lot of really useful bots , including the one that does what you describe . 
  the creators of botbust refuse to listen to reason and instead blindly ban basically any bot out there , not just spammy ones . 
  we can unremove it if you want , but because it 's been 11 hours since it was originally posted , the reddit algorithm means it 's probably not going to be seen by many people if we do . 
  you would be better off re-posting it . 
  our subreddit rules allow any site , but unfortunately we have no control over the reddit-wide algorithm , which bans some sites . 
  i do n't know what site you were using before , but i 'm guessing it 's one that reddit bans . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
   half-orc , tiefling , drow are automatically evil, 
  tieflings are explicitly * not * automatically evil . 
  i do n't know anything about nentir vale tieflings . 
  are there even any novels set in that setting , let alone ones focussed on some tiefling characters like fr has brimstone angels ? 
  but i do know that i absolutely *** love *** the lore of tieflings in fr . 
  it 's incredibly well-written and engaging . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's quoted on the tiefling phb page, 
  indeed , it is . 
  the quote is from the prologue . 
  a later book in the series is also quoted on the dragonborn page . 
  there 's a little more teenage romance drama than i 'd ideally like , but it 's handled in a way that feels genuine and true to the characters . 
  and it 's not too hard to look past that for the main story , and the political intrigue of the hells . 
  and by the end , i was actually kinda getting engaged even in the drama just because i was invested in the characters . 
  another comment suggested it 's a regional thing . 
  wikipedia seems to imply nsw uses canteen while the rest of the country uses tuckshop . 
  i thought the report did a good job of getting that across . 
  the entire first two minutes were all about civil claims , and then it occasionally referred back to that through the rest of the video , including having lawyers comment more or less the same as what you 've said . 
   our civil litigation statute says we want civil litigation to be just , quick and cheap . 
   so down the smaller end of the scale , where you 're talking about a few thousand dollars , i can see real potential for online courts to avoid delay and cost . 
  sorry , but where do i find the inspector on discord ? 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  huh , cool . 
  thanks . 
  cmd-opt-i on macos , if anyone reading this is wondering . 
  i usually pull it up in the browser by right clicking on the thing i want to inspect and clicking `` inspect '' . 
  saves the step of having to search for the specific thing . 
  not sure if it 's relevant or not , but it 's currently a porn sub where other subreddits for the same idea already exist and are active . 
  i 'd like to turn it into a sub for the musical youtuber [ sideways ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uci7l9chxmljpuft67vw78qw ) . 
  that obviously assumes balls are in air , but it * also * assumes zero friction with the ground , which probably has some effect . 
  it also assumes physics is the same as in the real world . 
  which is certainly a common practice in these sorts of game theories , but if you can figure out values * without * relying on that , it 's even better . 
  and flymolo has a method which does n't rely on in-world physics being the same as ours .
