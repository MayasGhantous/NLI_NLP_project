  mine lasts me an entire day of heavy use , and usually only gets down as far as maybe 20 % by 12 -- 1am . 
  i think i 've only used battery saver like two times the entire time i 've owned it . 
  i 'm 6:50 into it at the moment , and i 'm just wondering . 
  would this have been better , or worse , if it had been using kazoos , but played to the highest ability they could ? 
  obviously , part of the joke here is that they 're played terribly , but i wonder if the joke may have worked even better played straight . 
  i think someone needs to get on to this asap . 
  for science . 
  john williams is quite widely known in the film industry as `` the maestro '' . 
  rachmaninoff is `` the rach '' . 
  the `` the '' is important . 
  what really did it for me was the imitations of the trombone slides at 16:55 . 
  it sounded like a dying cat !, 
  you know , i think that might actually explain why i 've never been a huge fan of stravinsky , outside of le sacre . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions .

   they even included movement under and on massive creatures legolas style in the dmg section on more actions, 
  wait for real there are actual rules for this what page ? 
  every fucking time i have a fight with a dragon in my games , someone in my party tries to climb on top of it , so whoever 's dming at the time ( most recently me ) has to figure out how to roll with that on the fly . 
   satirical poetic fiction, 
  mate . 
  if it 's meant to be poetic , at least try a * little * formatting . 
  that 's a different , unrelated issue . 
  you can still override youtube 's settings and force it to download only at a specified resolution . 
  what / u/madcaesar and / u/turbo _ time are talking about is the fact that youtube now no longer lets you buffer an unlimited amount and keep that buffer in memory until you close the page . 
  you * used * to be able to go to a youtube watch page , wait for the whole video to buffer , and then you could turn off your internet connection and watch the whole video over and over again . 
  today , youtube buffers only a few seconds ( not sure exactly how much , i suspect ~ 30 sec ) , and will not buffer any more than that . 
  and it clears the buffer of any frames you have already watched . 
  so you ca n't go back and rewatch something you 've already done , and you ca n't load a whole video at once to watch later . 
  unfortunately for many people , it 's only available in the us , australia , new zealand , korea , and mexico . 
  i 'm curious , why would you want a 30 second forward button on netflix ? 
  it 's a feature that makes sense on podcatchers to skip ads . 
  and skipping backwards makes sense in case you missed something and want to repeat it . 
  but why skip forward on an ad-free medium ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  most youtubers talk so fucking slowly . 
  for some of them , even at 2.0 it feels too slow . 
  for most , 1.5 or 2.0 is just perfect . 
  i do n't use it on narrative stuff like sketches or scripted tv shows/films , because it messes with pacing . 
  but on informational videos or other `` talking heads '' type videos , it 's super useful . 
  options 2 and 3 work without any problem on mobile , and option 1 works in any even remotely acceptable quality mobile app . 
  this post right here is the first i 'm hearing about the whole issue . 
  so i am * definitely * not totally up-to-date and informed about this thing . 
  but , if the comments here are to be believed , the guy died immediately as the result of trying to steal from someone else . 
  that 's not about the rights of children , aboriginal or otherwise . 
  no one deserves to die for stealing , but a person taking reasonable action to defend their own property which leads to the accidental death of the thief also should n't be penalised for that . 
  wait , the g5 does n't even have nfc ? 
  shit , that alone is enough for me to throw it right out of consideration ... 
   they were talking about not having the ability to pause the video and buffer the entire thing . 
  that would be caused by dash, 
  no it would n't . 
  dash is about the quality of the video being chosen . 
  there is zero technological reason that dash would have any effect on the total amount of the video that gets buffered . 
   the problem with the whole `` load a whole video and watch later with no internet '' thing is that people were doing exactly that ... except not watching the video later and closing out the webpage instead, 
  true . 
  and that would have been a more appropriate answer to the above comment . 
  i think it 's a bullshit excuse , because for a company the size of google , the user experience should be worth more than a limited amount of extra cost in bandwidth . 
  plus , it 's no excuse for them removing already watched segments from the buffer . 
  if anything , that actually costs them * more * bandwidth than otherwise . 
  i 've read the entire dmg , minus the magic items section . 
  there 's just so much in there that it 's easy to forget individual sections like that . 
  yeah , i remembered most those other options . 
  disarm i always hated because of how abusable it is . 
  mark just seemed like a really bad attempt at porting a really good 4e feature . 
  shove aside i 've just never seen any demand for . 
  cover from other creatures is something i 'd love to use , but is just too much work to use at the table . 
  flaming rules is another one i might have to take a second look at though , it sounds interesting . 
  thanks . 
  yeah unfortunately reddit is really opaque . 
  we ca n't even get a proper list of * which * sites are banned , let alone * why * they are . 
  best of luck getting this seen !, 
  yeah i 've been using flanking for a long time , but my group decided to make it +2 rather than advantage , so that other sources of advantage are n't depowered . 
   look for the movie eroica, 
  it 's already available [ right here in the comments on this thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uta7m3vib70 ) !, 
  it 's bad enough when mods take it upon themselves to ban useful bots ( e.g. , via botbust ) . 
  now the reddit admins are doing it , too ?
