  i would n't worry too much about it . 
  first , this is n't your * actual * predicted grade . 
  you wo n't get that until after your mocks . 
  this is just an informal thing your teachers are giving you to give you a kick up the bum . 
  second , predicted grade is n't really worth that much in the long run . 
  it is , after all , only your predicted grade , not your real one . 
  as a brisbanite , i would be more than happy for the far north to be its own state separate from mine . 
  could we split off the west too ? 
  yeah it 's really frustrating when software does n't work properly with that layout . 
  even worse is that these apps fail to function if you treat it as being cmd + the qwerty key , ** and ** they fail if you treat it as cmd + the dvorak key . 
  i usually just end up not using those apps as much as possible , or learn to use them with a different layout instead . 
  thankfully , the biggest problems for me are sibelius -- where the fact that all letters a -- g are reachable be the left hand using qwerty is a massive boon -- and programming ides -- where i use a custom keyboard layout * anyway * , to put more appropriate symbols in easier to reach places -- so the problem is mostly self-solving . 
  i end up just using straight up dvorak shortcuts while programming , which is certainly not ideal , but does make it easier to adapt when a shortcut is option-letter or control-letter , and not cmd-letter . 
  i would n't say the hills hoist is a lesser known icon . 
  it 's a classic part of the australian dream . 
  mentioned in one of the most iconic folk songs we 've got , home among the gumtrees . 
  nearly everyone who lives in a house anywhere outside of very centre of major cities has one . 
  assuming it 's `` current politicians '' , my answer today is different from what it would 've been a month ago , unfortunately . 
  but today it 's probably plibersek . 
  mostly tongue in cheek . 
  but also i guess it 'd make our state politics less conservative . 
   it 's cheaper to bring someone over from the usa than to link them on a video for a few hours . 
  holy shit . 
  no way . 
  i mean , it literally says edinburgh in the comment . 
  they have an accent that 's more understandable than parts of northern and south western england . 
  hey , if we 've got that space , maybe we could put the engine inside this helmet . 
  might also need a clue of extra wheels to balance all that weight on the helmet . 
  i do n't know about other parts of sea , but in vietnam , this is n't entirely true . 
  car drivers there have been using bikes for so long that they do n't know how to fucking drive a car , so they try to do it in pretty much the same unstandardised way they 'd ride a bike . 
  it works fine for bikes because they 're small and can just go with the flow . 
  but when a car takes up a while lane by himself , things get ducked up quickly . 
  works fine on my kubuntu computer . 
  not sure if it 's proprietary or not , but i do n't think i 've ever gone out of my way to install a proprietary codec . 
  this is actually a really fucking old technology . 
  it 's been built in to macos since at least 2004 ( that being the oldest forum post about it i found on the first page of google ) , and i highly doubt that macos was the first place the tech existed . 
  yeah , this seems like a complete no-brainer to be honest . 
  of fucking * course * it 's going to do that . 
  it would be such a colossal mistake not to . 
  the worst for me are the fucking magpies . 
  murderous little bastards . 
  i 'd swap some bears out in remote parts of the country for birds that swoop you on your front doorstep any day . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean . 
  to me , this is a tragedy , but not a crime . 
  it 's sad that the thief died , but it was also not the fault of the person he stole from . 
  the usa is ** leagues ** higher than us in population density , even once you take out the top few cities . 
  australia 's top 10 cities take up 72.52 % of our entire population ( june 2016 ) . 
  america 's top 10 have a total population of 24.5 million ( slightly more than australia 's total of 24.13 & mdash ; just including this for interest 's sake ) , which is less than 8 % of the whole population ( 2010 ) . 
  that 's a whole order of magnitude different . 
  like i said in the initial comment , all i was going from was the comments in this thread , which lead me to believe in was an accident . 
  may not have been . 
  maybe he deliberately ran the guy down , in which case fuck him . 
  his bike is n't worth someone else 's life . 
   unfortunately our election cycles that it is n't really politically viable to start massive projects, 
  and yet so many people on this subreddit were complaining that 4 year terms are a bad idea . 
  fuck that shit , i want 5 year terms . 
  i want governments that can fucking govern , not have to be worried about the next election in six fucking months . 
  what in the holy fuck . 
  i do n't think that 's a mistake many people are likely to make . 
  the us place is a tiny little town that i doubt most * floridians * have heard of , let alone americans , let alone people from the rest of the world . 
  same goes for brisbane , california . 
  my idea is 5 year terms in the reps , 10 years in the senate . 
  some places might need larger councils . 
  all the various different councils in sydney seems like it must be a complete clusterfuck . 
  brisbane does it well though . 
  no need to make bcc any larger ( or smaller , for that matter ) . 
  i agree for what it 's worth though . 
  keep states for sporting events only . 
  the main thing i would worry about with no states is that it might mean nsw gets a lot more say than they currently do , and their current state parliament is fucking retarded when it comes to for example road rules . 
  i lived in south east asia for much of my life , where day long blackouts are not uncommon . 
  does n't mean that i 'm gon na excuse a power out in australia , in the city , during fine weather . 
  that shit just should not be happening here . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  you should try asking at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext to ask questions about game ideas . 
  music performance is not a skill that can easily be learned online . 
  you really need a proper in person teacher who can watch you and correct your technique . 
  our smoking rules are the best in the world . 
  and i wish cops would be * more * strict with some road rules . 
  tailgating , indicating for sufficient time before taking action , swerving on and out of lanes , things like that . 
  when you 're on the road everything you do is a potential risk to yourself and others . 
  people need to learn to drive safely . 
  speed traps at the bottom of a hill or immediately after a drop from 100 to 60 can fuck right off , though . 
  i agree with you about most of the other stuff . 
  then people will build more robots . 
  and they 'll build robots that build robots . 
  any job which * can * be replaced by artificial intelligence , * will * be replaced by them , in the medium-to-long term . 
  not post scarcity , just that the material involved in replacing humans in most jobs is very low . 
  think about it , what would you need to have to replace a human driver ? 
  just some computer chips and sensors in the car . 
  to replace a surgeon ( if the ai were technically good enough ) ? 
  just the same tools as before , on a little chunk of movable plastic or metal , and some tiny sensors . 
  what about a banker , or lawyer , or teacher ( again , assuming that the ai is good enough , which in different jobs is more or less feasible than others ) ? 
  that 's not relevant when the absolute advantage is significant enough that demand can be met for all goods and services from one source more efficiently than another source can even when specialising . 
  you ca n't meet * all * needs . 
  only the demand for robots is easy to meet ( easy in the sense of allocation of existing resources -- not easy in the sense of developing the technology to begin with ) . 
  sorry , but this submission is not complete to a degree that this subreddit can accept . 
  we do not require that content be polished and perfectly balanced , but we do require that content appear fleshed out and immediately usable . 
  as this is an unfinished piece of homebrew , i am removing it . 
  please comment on the arcana forge megathread at the top of the sub to get help finishing this off , so that it is ready for critique and balancing on the main part of the subreddit . 
  i hope you find answers in the arcana forge .
