  hey , i 've applied an * appropriate * flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an * appropriate * flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  yup , exactly . 
  they 've had one chance , and the support team they sent op to proved itself utterly incompetent . 
  they do n't deserve another . 
  a tio complaint is completely warranted . 
  to be fair , part of that is simple inflation . 
  $ 1,000,000 today is the equivalent of less than $ 620,000 in 1996 . 
  a million dollars today is just not worth anywhere near as much as it was 20 years ago , irrespective of extent to which the housing bubble has made housing specifically unaffordable . 
  no they are n't . 
  they 're 5 that are hand picked based on a larger ( we do n't know exactly how much larger -- might be 10 , might be 100 ) selection of algorithmically generated most trending subs . 
  mate . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is the only place you can reliably get good feedback on homebrew . 
  half the comments on this subreddit are people who do n't even know how 5e works , let alone how to build good 5e homebrew . 
  / r/dndnext will be vastly better than here , but they tend to have problems with understanding balance ( e.g. , they think the mystic and the loremaster wizard are perfectly okay ) . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is full of people who know how to homebrew well . 
  the baader-meinhof phenomenon . 
  i thought the blue eyes were achieved using dragonglass . 
  he first saw it yesterday , and now is seeing it randomly pop up in unexpected , unrelated , places . 
  that 's baader-meinhof . 
  it 's on the official game of thrones youtube channel . 
  they did n't put the inside the episodes up for s07e02 and e03 until like half a week after e03 aired for some reason , but the first week 's and this week 's ones were up same day . 
   in which case you do n't get `` previously on '' , `` next weeks preview '', 
  fuckin ' sign me up for that then !, 
  i hate that spoilery rubbish . 
   the rains of castamere , which is kind of the lannister theme song, 
  in terms of musical analysis of djawadi 's score for the show , it 's * literally * the lannister theme . 
  ( or rather , has been since season 2 . 
  in season 1 the lannister theme was what is now the littlefinger/scheming theme . ), 
   closer to libertarian by todays standards, 
  maybe originally . 
  and there are certainly those in the party who would like it to be that still . 
  but in the last decade or so there 's been a very strong push towards religious conservative extremism in the party , and that 's what their policies seem to tend towards these days . 
  they 're currently officially claiming their backlog is 27 days , based on the pm i got when requesting a sub two days ago . 
   live player position add on, 
  could someone explain what this is ? 
  can i get an eli5 for a non-lawyer ? 
  i 'm familiar generally with the stereotype of `` sovereign citizens '' ( it 's part of the reason i enjoy this subreddit -- that and the medieval weaponry ) , but do n't know enough to understand what specifically about this guys claims allowed him to win . 
  sounds kinda like he did n't win so much as his previous loss was overturned , and now has to go back to court ? 
  because he was n't given a chance to state his case last time ? 
  that 's my lay reading of it , anyway . 
  ah thanks . 
  i can see why some people might want that . 
  yeah i saw some comments on youtube saying the same thing . 
  to me , that sounds like being overhanded as a dm . 
  i would certainly be inclined to very strongly dissuade them from doing something , and explain the reasons why it 's a terrible idea , and the consequences they may face because of it . 
  if some of the party wants to do it , and others in the party do not , then those who want to do it can do it , the rest of the party can either try to stop them ( by convincing them through roleplay , or if necessary , through force ) , or they can just live with it . 
  but if the players are entirely clear about all that , and want to do it anyway , you ca n't stop them . 
  yeah i 'm also really wondering that . 
  it 's a `` sociological phenomenon '' . 
  that 's basically all we know . 
  what could that be ? 
  i forgot apple maps was a thing . 
  do people actually use it ? 
  by the way , charge your phone mate !, 
  someone from this sub should post that train thing from the shopping centre in the city . 
  honestly , i 'm on the user 's side on this one . 
  they were unnecessarily rude about how they went about it , but their desire for support was genuine , and i think they have a right to expect it . 
  isps are infamously bad with customer service , and in this case it looks like your company has things set up in a shit way . 
  if they contact you expecting support , only for you to go `` nope sorry , i ca n't help you , a different department will have to . 
  oh , and that department is n't operating right now '' , that 's your company 's fault , not the user 's . 
  not your fault either , and you do n't deserve to cop abuse for it , but it 's understandable that the user would be frustrated by the crap support that they 've been provided with because of how the company has set itself up .

  i have n't properly run the maths , but the stat changes look fine . 
  not sure why you 've changed the flavour for them too though . 
  i 'm not a fan of that .

  note that with point two , it is * still your responsibility * to ensure that autoflairing was done correctly . 
  in this case , because you included the word `` ua '' in the title , it was incorrectly flaired `` meta '' . 
  i thought my method was convoluted , but yours make mine look positively intuitive . 
  another name for port is larboard . 
  as in starboard and larboard . 
  larboard has an l in it . 
  so does left . 
  ah that 's great . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah that 's the one .
