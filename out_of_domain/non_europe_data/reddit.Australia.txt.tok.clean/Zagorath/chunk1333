  urgh no . 
  a portal that can only be accessed from their site is a terrible idea . 
  i 'd still pirate if that was how they did digital versions . 
  that would mean not only do you have to have internet access , but you 're relying on them having 100 % uptime , on their servers not fucking up , you 've got another username and password to remember , and you have to log in every time you want to access the pdf that you , paid for . 
  also , probably , not ability to do things like add digital mark-ups , print out pages , etc. 
  i 'd love a pdf , but if it is n't drm free , they can fuck right off . 
  that 's as bad as not having them at all . 
  i 'm like 70 % sure the poodle is in the closet . 
  to the mooooon !, 
  best fast food chips in the ~ ~ country ~ ~ * world * . 
  also roast chicken  fried chicken . 
   firstly , the fact that labor have committed to a binding vote after the next election changes the math . 
  they 're not going to lose votes to labor, 
  unless they are someone who sees it as a choice basically just between those two ( a lot of the country ) , and they prefer labor in general , but feel so strongly about this one issue that they would change over it . 
  if both parties are equal on this issue , they may indeed go back to labor . 
  just a hypothetical . 
   the sane thing to do would be to quietly encourage people so inclined to cross the floor , which is what it seemed turnbull was trying to do . 
  the issue goes away and most of the lnp keep their hands clean . 
  seriously . 
  i 'm astonished that 's not what they 're doing . 
  i thought for sure that would be it . 
  never heard of them . 
  edit , based on their website , they 've got two locations in central coast queensland , and three in regional wa . 
  and that 's it . 
  hardly even worth considering . 
  boppeboye said it better than i could have .

  feel free to repost it with a more appropriate title . 
  i agree . 
  the classic quarter/half and chips are fan-fucking-tastic . 
  i 've never even considered going outside of that . 
   optional for dedicated bike paths / footpaths, 
  yeah i quite like this idea . 
  keep requiring helmets for on road cycling , but let people drop them when on dedicated bike paths or on the footpath . 
  i still think people are stupid to not wear a helmet even then . 
  but if they want to be stupid , let them . 
  it 's the podiatrists that i really do n't trust . 
   or dedicated cycle lanes, 
  i 'd strike that from the list , as far as non-separated bike lanes go . 
  they 're a lot better than roads without them , but they do n't hold a candle to proper separated bike paths . 
  i suspect that seatbelts may not be as necessary on buses because buses are fucking big . 
  unless they get hit bit a truck or somehow ram into a wall , an accident is going to have a much lower effect on the momentum of a bus than a car . 
  but i 'm speaking mostly out of my arse here . 
  could be wrong . 
  and cars have airbags , which fulfil the same function as helmets . 
  the ones that go cycling without a helmet ? 
  yup . 
  my thought is that rules should not be changed mid-season where possible , but that in the future , the no-script option should be used . 
  it 's also possibly too early to see how effective the no-script option will end up being . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests .

  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  that 's not football . 
  not in this subreddit . 
  i 'm pretty sure those are n't australian teams , so not really `` australian '' nostalgia . 
  ninja edit : looked at user 's profile . 
  clearly a spambot trying to build up a log of content to look legit, 
  bloody europeans with their silly sports and silly names . 
  their use of symbolism meant to invoke nazi germany makes it seem more likely to me that this is critical of the right ( both alt-right and religious conservatives ) . 
  because literally everyone worth taking seriously is going to find nazi imagery used sincerely insulting . 
  prior to 2016 , voting above the line meant the same thing as voting below the line in the way that the party 's `` group voting ticket '' specified . 
  that 's where they make backroom deals and decide who to give the preference to . 
  after the clusterfuck that was the 2013 election , this rule got changed . 
  so from the 2016 election onwards , voting above the line for a party means the same as voting below the line for that party , in the order on the ballot . 
  but once you reach the end of that party 's candidates , your vote is exhausted . 
  this is why you have to number at least 6 parties above the line . 
  if all the candidates from your first party are eliminated , then it goes to the top candidate in your second preference , and then the second candidate in your second preference , and so on . 
  [ this page ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/how_to_vote/voting_senate.htm ) explains how to vote in the senate . 
  the `` above the line '' example they gave would be the same as the below the line votes in [ this example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gkfm5cw.png ) .

  with a problem like this , i think you 'll need to contact avid . 
  it 's very unlikely that we 'll be able to help . 
  you may want to use pastebin to paste an error message this long , too . 
  for a little bit of troubleshooting , if you use both english and chinese , it works , right ? 
  is that with english first , and then chinese , or the other way around ? 
  or does it work * both * ways ?

  the flavour here seems a lot less interesting than the flavour given in the original version . 
  nothing about the living gate . 
  nothing that approximates the original 's description of how they experience emotion . 
  nothing about the different philosophies they have . 
  and jesus fuck those names are cliche . 
  what was wrong with the original names ? 
  if i read this without knowing what shardminds are already , i 'd pass on it for being complete tripe . 
  also , as a mod i 'm obligated to tell you that you need to provide credit for the art you 've used .

   assume everyone is an idiot and want to crash into you, 
  honestly , that 's too far . 
  always be ready and expecting someone to be a moron who has n't seen you and does n't care for you . 
  but if you went around thinking everyone is an idiot who wants to crash into you , the ** only ** rational choice would be to ** never ** go on the road . 
  there 's a certain level of trust that is * absolutely * *** required *** to be on the road , whether that be as a cyclist , motorist , or pedestrian . 
  looks like apple here is doing the logical thing , by numbering seasons as actual seasons , instead of following the `` official '' numbering system like wikipedia does , which takes two completely * separate * seasons and just randomly deciding to call them one season . 
  the living gate lore and the three philosophies associated with it was , to me , literally the only thing that made the shardminds stand out as an engaging race . 
  without it they make no fucking sense . 
  just a crystal that 's alive .
