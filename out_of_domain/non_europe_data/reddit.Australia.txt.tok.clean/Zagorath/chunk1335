  i do n't want to do it that way . 
  if i did n't already have prior knowledge of how fucked up their system is , i would probably be the cause of dozens of drivers losing their ability to work for uber . 
  ( or rather , i would , if i used uber regularly & mdash ; i do n't actually use uber , taxis , or any of their competitors very much . ), 
  4 stars is standard for me . 
  3 stars for very slight faults . 
  5 if i feel they 've gone out of their way to be great . 
  but no . 
  if you use uber , you have to give 5 stars as standard , and if they do an especially good job , well too fucking bad . 
  no way to signify that . 
   not a big enough total of the population to make graphics less informative just to cater to that small of a minority, 
  this is a complete false dilemma . 
  as [ this link ] ( http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&amp;scheme=puor&amp;n=3 ) , which i found above , shows , there are plenty of colour schemes which can be used that are both highly informative to colour-typical people ( not sure if that 's the term for it ) and red-green colourblind people . 
  that would certainly explain why paris has such an incredibly low gradient for the drop-off in its star ratings . 
  le m\u00e9tro is such a good transport system that you can get in to the city really easily even from relatively far out . 
  i vaguely recall hearing it once or twice in matt 's videos , but it 's really only a vague recollection and i could n't say which videos he says it in . 
  i 'm just really glad to be reading this thread and finding at least three strangers who agree with me and can relate to the `` hated by both sides because you try to take a rational objective look at the stats '' experience . 
  yeah wizards has quite deliberately been marketing it in such a way as to get people to believe as you did . 
  the fact that it 's actually not a wizards product in any way other than them licensing the ip is being carefully ignored . 
  i use a righty mouse , but my keyboard layout is dvorak . 
  it completely confuses the fuck out of anyone who tries to use my computer . 
  i do n't know about the american dmv , but my local equivalent has you draw a number , and you go up when your number is called . 
  in practice , it 's equivalent to a queue , since it 's basically first come , first serve . 
  but it 's a queue that 's implemented as a priority queue where they set your priority based on time of being enqueued . 
   in that world atheism is literally insane -- there are gods actually walking around talking to people, 
  in other dc comics properties , maybe , but i do n't ever recall that happening in young justice . 
  we got the so-called `` new gods '' of new genesis and apokolips , but i 've never really thought of them as literal gods in the way that the gods from the abrahamic , hindu , ancient egyptian , or ancient greek myths might be considered gods . 
  as far as i 'm aware they 're not responsible for creation , or for delivering punishments/rewards in death , determining morality , or explaining the natural phenomena , in the way that actual `` gods '' would be . 
  much like the yj universe does not have the speed force , it may not have whatever gods are typically present in dc universes . 
  it definitely will slow you down quite a lot at first . 
  but if if you work hard at it , you should be able to type at a respectable level pretty quickly . 
  [ here is the totally unscientific measurement i took ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ragyolm.png ) of my typing speed after i switched to dvorak . 
  that 's based on typing a single paragraph each day ( switching what the paragraph was every couple of days ) in both dvorak and qwerty , and timing my typing speed . 
  and if you 're like most people , you probably spend much more time thinking about * what * to type than actually typing , anyway . 
  plus , remember , this is your * health * we 're talking about . 
  yes , dvorak is superior because at the end of it , you 'll probably have a faster typing speed . 
  but its * main * advantage is that by using it you 're less likely to develop or inflame rsis in your wrists and fingers . 
  and your own physical well-being * has * to come before some minor productivity increase . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  i have a minor realism question . 
  i 'm sure a lot of people have seen [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkjawdvx5_q ) about how dungeons should have vaulted ceilings . 
  my question is : is lloyd right here ? 
  ## would a dungeon carved in to a mountain need vaulted ceilings to stay in tact ? 
  and if so , how do natural caves stay up , when they do not have vaulted ceilings ? 
  can anyone with specific knowledge about it let me know , or if anyone knows a better place to post this ? 
   the existence of scrying and planar travel seems to preclude it, 
  not necessarily . 
  scrying may simply work at the speed of light . 
  the size people are normally talking about on a single plane is such that the speed of light would be effectively instantaneous anyway . 
  and planar travel involves literal other planes . 
  any interaction with other planes is not necessarily bound by the laws of the prime material . 
  the prime material could have special relativity even while the hells do not . 
  or both could have it , but in such a way as they do n't interact with * one another * . 
  sorcerers and warlocks are also 1 . 
  which makes sense , because their power literally * entirely * comes from the specific source of power represented by their subclass . 
  ( warlocks pick a second sort of mini-subclass at level 3 . ), 
  i had a character at my table go into fighter , rogue , and barbarian once . 
  it made total sense for his character 's growth , but by god was he * crazy * unoptimised . 
  dvorak and qwerty are both ... not great for programming . 
  braces , brackets , and square brackets are all awkwardly off to the side , and most of them are pressed by the same finger . 
  there 's a standard layout out there called `` programmer 's dvorak '' which is a lot better than both the standard dvorak and qwerty , but it has a few problems of its own . 
  personally , i use [ this layout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgphjcl.png ) which i created for myself , that i call `` coder 's dvorak '' . 
  it makes the most important programming symbols really easy to reach and actually quite intuitive . 
  i find it completely natural to shift between standard dvorak for most typing , and coder 's dvorak when programming . 
  it 's like what linguists call a `` code shift '' , and it 's so effortless and natural that sometimes i 'll instinctively move my fingers as though they 're in coder 's dvorak when i switch to my ide , before i 've actually remembered to switch my keyboard layout over . 
  the real answer is that it 's entirely security theatre . 
  they need to * look * like they 're being effective and doing stuff , far more than they actually need to enhance security . 
  enchantment ? 
  enchantment !, 
  ooh , i love a good interrobang !, 
  i know this is * super * niche , but is there any chance of us getting numerical search ? 
  and search by range . 
  or less niche : search by flair * class * ? 
  for example , / r/boh5e uses flair to display the average * score * given to submissions . 
  it 'd be nice to be able to search and say `` i want only things that scored  8.0 . 
  it also uses flair classes to determine roughly what category it 's in . 
  would be nice to say `` i want to search for things that are ` excellent ' . '', 
  ## overall score 7.83 / 10, 
  ### overview :, 
  this is a really great collection of items . 
  most of them have immensely strong flavour , with only a few problems here and there . 
  there are a few mechanical quirks that really ought to be ironed out , but most of those could be done quite easily by even the most inexperienced of dms . 
  for the most part , with these sorts of powerful magical artefacts , `` balance '' per se is not much of an issue . 
  nevertheless , those items where balance is explicitly an issue do seem to be very well designed . 
  the biggest flaw , by far , is the language . 
  there were numerous grammatical and typographical problems which distracted from reading this quite substantially . 
  they were worst at the beginning , but did persist throughout . 
  ### wording/formatting : 7/10, 
  the gap after the very first paragraph is unusually large , and a similar problem exists on page 4 . 
  for the most part , however , this looks * impeccable * . 
  the art is gorgeous and its tearing and watermarking into the page is superb . 
  however , some of the art does not seem to especially fit in with the content of its page . 
  for example , the 7th page of the document has the chains of madness and chaos , but a picture of a man wearing nothing but a belt ( made of solid metal , not chain links ) , casting a spell that creates some sort of firey skull . 
  no real connection there . 
  this document * seems * to have hyperlinks on each page to take you back to the contents . 
  unfortunately , these links are actually all for show . 
  clicking them has no effect . 
  additionally , the contents themselves would benefit from being made into clickable links , if any such links were included .
