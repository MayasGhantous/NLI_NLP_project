  the text , while selectable , seems to be pre-rendered , as when i zoom into it for better readability , it gets blurry . 
  this is certainly suboptimal . 
  the style of this document 's text is wonderfully engaging . 
  it is written as though there is an author speaking directly to the reader . 
  teaching them of the ancient and powerful items described within . 
  this makes it an absolute joy to read , instead of simply a purely utilitarian document as such a compendium could easily have been . 
  there are a numerous very minor grammatical and spelling mistakes . 
  missing commas separating clauses make some of the document a little more mentally taxing than it need be . 
  for example , the first two instances i noticed of this were `` it devoured all knowledge that it could for it was a mind trapped in an existence it did not know could be otherwise '' and `` unsurprisngly the apprentice did not last long but his passing intrigued the sword '' , both from the mourneblade . 
  that second quote also contains the first typo i noticed . 
  later within the same item , the document contains `` anymore '' when `` any more '' was intended . 
  `` the students master came in '' is missing an apostrophe . 
  `` practicioner '' is a misspelling of `` practitioner '' . 
  there are more such mistakes throughout the document . 
  each of them very minor and do not hinder understanding , but they are far more numerous than could be considered acceptable , considering each of the aforementioned errors was found on the very first page of content in this document with 18 substantive pages . 
  only once did i find a mistake so severe that i truly can not understand it . 
  `` much like these do the onyx gates appear and in nature they are very similar . '' i have honestly no idea what this is meant to mean . 
  in truth , a lot of the writing on the paths eternal was among the worst contained in this document . 
  but that one sentence stood out even among this . 
  the nameless contains what is probably a typo , so i 'm judging it here rather than in balance , but if taken literally , it changes the interpretation of the creature 's effective hit points significantly . 
   necrotic , poison , bludgeoning , piercing , and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, 
  the way this is worded makes it seem as though necrotic or poison dealt from sources other than nonmagical weapons are also not resisted by its immunity . 
  there are also some stylistic problems with it . 
  most notably , spell names are repeatedly capitalised even when they do not consist of a proper noun . 
  one final thing that i found odd about this document , but which is not necessarily * wrong * , per se , was the mix of british and american english . 
  `` ize '' is used rather than `` ise '' , but `` honour '' , not `` honor '' , and , most notably , `` artefact '' is used , not the american `` artifact '' . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9/10, 
  i like these items a lot . 
  as i mentioned in the previous section , the writing style is highly evocative and it makes you feel as though you 're reading a tome written by a great loremaster who has spent his entire life researching these extremely rare and powerful artefacts . 
  the mourneblade is fantastic . 
  it 's the exact sort of magical item i love . 
  powerful , but corrupting . 
  not directly * cursed * , per se , but which continued use of will drive the wielder to their own destruction . 
  it 's like the one ring . 
  harlequin 's masque is just ... chilling . 
  absolutely chilling . 
  as someone who grew up with the deltora quest books , the idea of magic items that come in sets which become more powerful once you complete the collection is one that i absolutely love . 
  unfortunately , these specific items just did not grab me in any meaningful way . 
  perhaps it 's the fact that i simply find demons much less interesting than devils , but the flavour of this item felt pretty bland to me . 
  the mendax oculus , on the other hand , is a very interesting device . 
  with its wielder not knowing that they are being given false information after some time , i can easily envisage it resulting in some very interesting situations . 
  khyber 's folly has a really fascinating backstory to it , but the item itself is one whose flavour i would consider only slightly above average . 
  the use of a riff on edgar allen poe 's `` the raven '' in the neverwear is really clever . 
  a lovely touch . 
  and so appropriate , for such a creepy almost lovecraftian style of item . 
  some great flavour , and i certainly do not envy any characters who find themselves ensnared by this item 's evil . 
  swansong is a really potentially interesting item , but i do not feel it lives up to its potential . 
  neither the description nor the item 's stats mention , for example , anything about those wielding the ring feeling the toll it takes on their body , which could provide a fascinating narrative as the character feels they are drawing near to their end and they try their hardest to go out in a blaze of glory . 
  the description also has a rather confusing bit about how users of these rings turn in to twisted madmen , which does not really fit the theme as i imagined it . 
  the item itself has no mention of this madness , and the description only vaguely makes mention of it . 
  i myself would be inclined to ignore this aspect , and treat it much like the phoenix from matt colville 's adventures . 
  as an item of noble sacrifice that one can use in a desperate attempt to save one 's land . 
  the religious references in the revenant encarmine are most appropriate . 
  it 's such an amazingly evocative item . 
  the blood-traitor abilities are especially interesting , and the clerical ties match up with the flavour text really nicely . 
  the flavour text for the devil 's dice has one minor throwaway line which triggered a ** major ** bugbear of mine . 
  it conflates devils and demons , implying that they are the same , or at the very least similar . 
  they are , of course , * no such thing * . 
  the item itself , unfortunately , is a little hamtfisted in its concept . 
  it brings the user great luck , but leaves misfortune in their wake . 
  but this misfortune does not seem to usually be actually * related * in some meaningful way to the actions of the user . 
  if it were , this item would be capable of delivering a very powerful metaphor , and would be really intriguing . 
  the flavour text sort of hints at this , in how the victims of the owner 's military strategy turned to evil in an attempt to save themselves . 
  but none of the other misfortunes caused by the devil 's dice seemed to have this same direct relationship , which is a shame . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 7.5 / 10, 
  magical items are , by design , rather difficult to balance appropriately . 
  and artefacts are worse than most , since they do not have the built in balance guidelines of a rarity level . 
  so most of my review of the mechanics here is on how interesting the mechanics themselves are to work with , when completely taken on their own , without the flavour . 
  however , i will first say that the various levels of wakefulness that some of the items have is an ingenious mechanic . 
  the ** mourneblade ** and ** khyber 's folly ** both use this very interesting and unique mechanic , and it makes judging their balance a lot easier , since the levels of wakefulness are reached upon the wielding character reaching a certain level . 
  and these i can safely say are very well balanced . 
  harlequin 's masque has an awesome flavour , but this is unfortunately let down by the fact that a mere third level spell can free someone from the curse bestowed by this ancient and powerful artefact is a bit incongruous . 
  many of the other items in this collection suffer the same problem , unfortunately . 
  the chain of chaos 's `` reliance of one '' ability has some strange issues , in that the effect can not be dispelled unless concentration is broken , but concentration can be ended at any time . 
  or , if that is explicitly disallowed ( though this document does not say so ) , there are still numerous other ways to get around the restriction . 
  it 's an awkward mechanic that does not work very well . 
  the other parts of the anarchist 's chain have this same problem . 
  the charge mechanic of mendax oculus is a very interesting one that i would rather like to see employed by more cursed magical items . 
  having their own use of the item build up its ability to perform some other action against the user is an interesting approach . 
  i particularly like the way the mechanic is worded , such that charge points are still built up even when they are also expended . 
  i.e. , you can spend one charge to have one sentence change , but you also gain one charge from the player using it at the same time . 
  the nameless is a difficult creature to rate on the cr scale . 
  however , from my calculations cr29 does seem appropriate . 
  regardless of the precise number associated with it , this creature is * deadly * . 
  that 's expected of such a high cr creature , so it 's not necessarily a problem , but it is important to point out . 
  the nameless can essentially remove one player of its choice from the game while it deals with the others . 
  its over 200 standard damage output , plus legendary actions , make its effective damage output enormous . 
  700 hit points , plus the ability to heal , plus the ability to make its enemies frightened also make this * really * tough to kill . 
  use this creature with care . 
  the swansong is not a balanced item . 
  it does n't really try to be . 
  it is an item where the intent is super incredible power in a last-ditch attack . 
  but it * is * super incredible power . 
  at least in terms of raw stats . 
  unfortunately , in d&d these stats rarely mean quite as much as some of the * abilities * you are granted . 
  it 's unfortunate , but i suspect that someone using this ring might not find it quite as impressive as they had hoped . 
  the * haste * that it gives you is quite interesting , but for something designed to turn a presumably already high level character into a near god temporarily , some larger abilities might have been more useful than just a stat bump . 
  revenant encarmine 's mechanics are mostly fine , but feel hastily written and perhaps unclear . 
  the wearer gains `` his class level in temporary hitpoints '' . 
  which class level ?
