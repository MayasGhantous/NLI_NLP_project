  their highest class level ? 
  it seems like it was supposed to be their total level , because to do otherwise is to bizarrely and unnecessarily decrease the power of this item specifically when used by multiclassed characters . 
  i do n't even know what these words mean , especially in the context of these trending subreddits . 
  i doubt very much it 's normal christians that become preppers for religion-related reasons . 
  it 's just those really crazy `` predicting the end of the world '' types . 
  the doomsday cult types that have been [ parodied by the simpsons and doubtless many other shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upy63rircrc ) . 
  paging / u/jackeyblob, 
  okay . 
  i do n't watch that show . 
  what 's the relationship to today 's trending subreddits ? 
  this is not a well-designed survey , i 'm afraid . 
  first , every question is marked required . 
  generally , survey questions should only be required when not answering them would ruin the entire point of the survey . 
  in other words , very rarely . 
  second , a few of these questions were impossible to answer . 
  how often do you buy new technology , once a year or never . 
  if you buy once every two years , you have no valid answer . 
  it needed a `` less than once per year '' option . 
  which of these services would you be interested in ? 
  there was no `` none '' option , and since it was marked required , simply not ticking any did n't work . 
  third , as others have mentioned , many of the questions were vague and poorly worded , making them difficult to answer . 
  what is `` one time '' using technology ? 
  if i continuously use technology through the day , with only brief breaks for meals , is that 4 uses of technology ? 
  this would have been better worded in terms of hours of use . 
  also , what is `` technology '' ? 
  computers , phones , and tablets ? 
  how about tv ? 
  radio ? 
  does it also include , like , light bulbs and shit ? 
  because light bulbs are definitely technology . 
  or cars . 
  cars are definitely a technological creation . 
  a specific answer to this needed to be given . 
  i do n't remember enough of the questions to provide detailed reasons why each question was poorly worded , but i think you get the idea . 
  it 's great that you 're trying though , and i hope your next attempt allows you to learn from your mistakes . 
  because there 's ** never ** anything wrong with making a mistake . 
  only with failing to learn from your mistakes . 
  best of luck !, 
  as shorten said , we should be holding turnbull * personally * accountable for every attack made against gay people and supporters of gay people during this `` debate '' . 
   you or i might disagree with them , and say that gay people do not suffer greater morbidity or mortality than the general population . 
  actually , this is a provably correct statistic . 
  the question then becomes * why * is it true ? 
  the answer most people accept is that it 's because they face persecution and belittling every day , and are treated as though they are unhealthy . 
  it is * precisely * the opinions that you described further up in your reply that * are the problem * . 
  they might argue that the higher mortality is an inherent part of being gay . 
  to that i say `` hogwash '' . 
   maybe basing cultural institutions on a 2000 year old book written by desert nomads, 
  even older , really , since much of the extremely hateful stuff is old testament . 
  find cut pro is leaps and bounds better than the others for smaller projects like short films , advertising , online content , etc. 
  it 's also , obviously , much better for the prosumer market than any of its competitors . 
  none of them can even * touch * it in that market . 
  it 's also improved a ** fuckload ** since the initial release of x. 
  most of the criticisms i 've seen levied at it were valid then , but are not now . 
  people just have n't updated their opinion in about 5 years ( 10.0.6 being the version that brought the last of the most common criticisms ) . 
  on my android phone connecting to the car stereo does the equivalent of pressing `` play '' on earphones . 
  it starts automatically playing whatever i 've been listening to most recently . 
  usually a podcast or audiobook . 
  [ here 's a direct link to the full song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsfypg4duhq ) since ( a ) abc 's player is apparently crap , and ( b ) they only put the first 45 seconds of it . 
  remember , air resistance is a * huge * factor once you 've been falling for a while . 
  it starts becoming noticable after about 1 & ndash ; 2 seconds . 
  [ this pdf ] ( http://www.greenharbor.com/fffolder/speedtime.pdf ) shows you the distance fallen and velocity of an average person in freefall , over time . 
  after 6 seconds , you would * really * have fallen 504 feet . 
  fall damage in d&d caps at 20d6 , which you reach at 200 feet . 
  this is , obviously , a * long * time before you 've reached terminal velocity in real life . 
  you reach 200 feet at about 3.5 seconds . 
  terminal velocity is n't reached until about 12 seconds . 
  at 200 feet , you 're going about 59 feet per second . 
  at terminal velocity , it 's about 174 fps . 
  so the rules are n't exactly accurate . 
  since fall speed increases near enough to linearly up to 200 feet , we can extrapolate a more realistic fall damage cap of 59d10 , reached at 1400 feet , including the standard `` 1d6 per 10 feet '' up until you reach 36d6 at 360 feet , and then damage increasing more slowly after that . 
  but honestly , that maths is just too complicated to be worth it , imo . 
  raw works fine . 
  those fuckin ' half germans invading our subreddit . 
  that had more to do with how the media is choosing to report things than with what the actual demands being made are . 
  the right wing of politics in this country has systematically being weakening and eroding public support for unions for decades now . 
  it 's no surprise that people have negative feelings towards industrial action , when many unions are forced to be far weaker than they ought to be by onerous laws , and when everything they hear in the media is about how greedy and corrupt unions are . 
   it allows your phone to send its custom ringtone to the connected bluetooth device . 
  thus with an in-band ringtone you no longer have to hear whatever default beeping noise your bluetooth device makes when you receive a phone call . 
  in case anyone else was wondering what this means . 
  one thing that annoys me with bluetooth is that if you 're connected to a car , in order to hear driving directions over bluetooth , you * have * to also be listening to audio over the phone . 
  it 'll interrupt the radio for a call , but wo n't interrupt radio with directions . 
  it 's really damn annoying . 
  do people not know this ? 
  i think this is perhaps one of they few major points adam has made that 's seemed to me like something everyone must know ... it 's the first thing i remember reading about tutankhamen as a little kid when i was heavy into ancient egypt . 
  what happened to that xkcd bot which would tell you information about a comic without you needing to click on it ? 
  the fact that you ca n't get the alt text on mobile without first clicking `` open in browser '' and then altering the url to go to the m subdomain made that bot so useful , but i have n't seen it in ages . 
   while ( ignorant = = true ) {, 
   insult ( ) ;, 
  wtf is that style guide . 
   while ( ignorant ) {, 
   insult ( ) ;, 
  ftfy . 
  yes , that 's what i said . 
  if i receive a * call * the radio is interrupted . 
  but if i 'm using the phone for * directions * , it * wo n't * interrupt the radio . 
  oh huh , i just noticed that . 
  i still have to go `` open in browser '' , because unfortunately the reddit is fun internal browser does n't do that . 
  which is still a massive pain . 
  but one step less of a nuisance than i thought . 
  thanks !,
