  i hate when mods block useful bots like that . 
  open the file call `` hosts '' ( with ** no ** extension ) , and see if there 's a line that begins with `` google.com '' . 
  a lot of security software on windows redirects a bunch of malware domains to localhost , effectively blocking them , by adding a bunch of entries to your hosts file . 
  yes . 
  that is the initial method which i described above . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' .

  you were playing music over the radio , rather than via bluetooth , but the spoken directions still interrupted the radio ? 
  out of interest , why would you need a tutorial for music or podcasts ? 
  could n't you just use the dedicated mode for that ? 
  and if that tutorial is designed for music or podcasts , which are continuous audio streams , would the end result of doing the same thing with * directions * still allow for audio to play over the radio normally , and only duck that audio when directions are actually being given ? 
  it 's actually a typo . 
  they * meant * to say [ demiliches ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/demilich ) . 
  and you 're right , we want a lich at its full power !, 
  your title was great !, 
   warlock patrons are less powerful than gods, 
  absolutely not true . 
  archdevils and demon lords are near the same power level as gods . 
  and there are even gods , such as asmodeus , who are * also * archdevils . 
  and it is also possible to form a pact with a god . 
  it 's exceedingly rare , but it is conceivable . 
  as a country they seem quite remarkably technophobic , considering how forward they are in other respects . 
  their reticence to heavily adopt debit card payment has been much noted , and i 'll take your word for it regarding cloud technology . 
  then there are things like the stupid eu cookie popup all websites are now required to show and the `` right to be forgotten '' ( they 're eu laws , but considering germany 's power within the eu , i have little doubt that they were among the nations pushing for it ) . 
  or allowing people to opt out of google streetview ( which does nothing more than take photos * from a public place * , and already blurs out faces , number plates , etc. ) . 
  i 'm sure most of the germans here on reddit are quite a bit more rational than their government in these matters . 
  but it really is a shame how moronic the german government is when it comes to technology . 
  yup . 
  i would recommend orchestration online and richard atkinson as great channels to use to improve your composition craft . 
  but honestly , i 'm not sure how much they 'll help of you do n't have even the most basic of music theory understanding . 
  composition really is n't a skill that one can become good at without a strong theoretical background , which most people probably learn in highschool . 
  hopefully someone else can point you to an online course or possibly youtube series which provides that more basic level of knowledge . 
  but hopefully the two channels i mentioned are worth at least something with your current understanding . 
  i definitely think a return to the original intention of the subreddit is important . 
  i very nearly unsubscribed after that recent skateboarding gif . 
  this is a much smaller subreddit than many others , and if it does n't maintain its identity , what is the * point * of it ? 
  just a smaller version of other subreddits . 
  the `` something goes wrong or appears to go wrong \u00e9 en though it was intentional '' aspect is what * defines * this subreddit and makes it a cool place worth visiting , imo . 
  and [ here 's what christians do to gays ] ( http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-30/christian-ex-gay-conversion-programs-continue-in-australia/4854580 ) . 
  yeah , in the forgotten realms , dragonborn ( or `` vayemniri '' , as they prefer to be called ) come from the twin world of abeir originally , where they were enslaved by dragons . 
  during the spellplague , when abeir and toril crashed back together , some of the vayemniri were transplanted into toril , especially around what is now called tymanther . 
  but they still maintain a hatred of not only dragons , but anything which resembles a master-slave relationship . 
  this is also the reason that very , ** very ** few dragonborn worship gods , let alone become clerics . 
  the god-follower relationship seems too close to master-slave , for their liking . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  this looks like a highly unorthodox class based on the warlock 's spellcasting system . 
  unfortunately it kinda breaks the assumptions of how spellcasting works , in that it first gets spells at * 2nd * level , but it clearly follows a * full * caster progression . 
  if it were me , i would change the subclass to be a second level ability , and let it get its spellcasting at first level , to be a more orthodox spellcasting class . 
  it would also have the benefit of allowing an artificer to have a kind of trainee period , where they have n't decided what they 're going to specialise in yet . 
  i 'm gon na tag / u/revlid here , because as far as i can tell , it 's their artificer that you 're looking at . 
  below is the body of your original post , since it was remove which means people wo n't be able to see it :, 
   im having an issue reading the level chart for an artificer . 
  specifically concerning spells . 
  at second level , i get 3 spells/2 slots level 1 magic . 
  so at level 3 , do i have 3/2 1st level , and 3/2 2nd level ? 
  or am i reading this completely wrong . 
  my dm seems to think this class would only be able to cast 4 spells at level 20 ...

   bubbly soft drink, 
  as opposed to ... non-bubbly soft drinks ? 
  they 're really not . 
  the cookie thing is just ludicrous . 
  nearly every site uses and * needs * to use cookies as part of basic functionality . 
  the result of this rule is basically just an annoying popup every fucking time you visit a site hosted in the eu . 
  never mind that the european scaremongering over cookies is ridiculous to begin with . 
  the right to be forgotten is less obviously a problem , but far , far more insidious . 
  it allows people to censor and have removed even verifiable true facts , just because they do n't like them . 
  but even worse , it does so in a fully king moronic way . 
  media companies are exempt from it . 
  instead , europe , in its technophobic retardation , only forces google to remove the page from their index . 
  not the good reliable old fashioned media . 
  and the street view thing just has no rational basis to it . 
  these are photos taken from a public place of publicly visible activities . 
  any attempt to curtail that is ** by definition ** a horrible authoritarian overstep . 
  you do n't have a right to privacy when it comes to things that are visible easily from a public place . 
  plus , since this seems to be an electric piano rather than an acoustic one , i 'd think the damage done by using it is probably even less of a significant factor . 
  it uses less data than streaming , has more variety than would be gotten through my own local media , and has the option of listening to stuff like the news . 
  there 's something about the serendipity of radio that 's really nice , which you do n't get with locally stored music or podcasts . 
  false positive, 
  no , that 's an ovation .
