  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  hey sorry , but this is a subreddit for sharing stories in text format from roleplaying games . 
  we occasionally allow multimedia adaptations of pre-existing written stories , but content originally in multimedia form does not belong here . 
  you should try sharing this at / r/dnd or / r/gametales . 
  apparently it 's some fuels that are used in welding and cutting torches . 
  got ta be honest , from the title i thought it was medicines . 
  soft drink is , [ * by definition * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soft_drink#terminology ) , a carbonated drink . 
  i do n't recognise most of the drinks on the page you linked , but tea definitely is n't a soft drink , and orangina is basically to fanta as pepsi is to coke , more or less . 
  that 's a carbonated drink . 
  yeah sorry mate , but that 's just not true . 
  being carbonated is part of the definition of soft drink . 
  things like lemonade ( e.g. 
  sprite , 7 up ) , cola ( coke , pepsi ) , whatever the generic name is for fanta , sarsaparilla , ginger beer , etc. 
  pretty sure he 's a sea eagles fan . 
  probably would n't be caught dead in canterbury . 
  yup . 
  it has an apparent magnitude of 3.44 . 
  that 's substantially brighter than uranus or neptune , and sometimes brighter than mercury . 
  it 's also only * slightly * less bright than what wikipedia calls, 
   faintest stars visible in an urban neighborhood with naked eye, 
  so maybe within a million or so years , it 'll even be visible in urban neighbourhoods with the naked eye .

  they 're actually not allowed to . 
  content hosted on the dm 's guild is n't allowed to be shared elsewhere . 
  it 's one of the reasons that although we do n't outright ban it , we do strongly discourage it . 
  it has incredibly onerous terms and conditions which are absolutely hostile to creators and consumers alike . 
  do n't forget to turn on your lights . 
  dude . 
  it 's literally our ** one ** rule . 
  no edition warring . 
  this comment is being removed . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  this does n't really happen outside america . 
  white people in australia care a lot less about their ancestors ' nationalities than americans seem to , for example . 
  i saw this on one of those little ads the abc puts before programmes on iview . 
  literally all i saw ( was tuned out for most of the preview ) was `` gruen returns 13 september '' . 
  i quite literally screamed aloud in joy . 
  so excited for this show to be back . 
  had begun to worry it was n't going to be . 
  edit : how does `` of '' get autocorrected to `` forum '' ? 
  the fuck are you on about ? 
  australia 's more multicultural than america is . 
  this is n't an opinion i have , it 's a [ statistical fact ] ( http://eccv.org.au/community/media-releases/fact-australia-is-the-most-ethnically-diverse-country-in-the-world/ ) . 
  edit : the australia you may have seen presented on tv or film , or just through general cultural stereotypes , is very far from the reality of modern day australia . 
   asian ( south asian ), 
  found the brit . 
  to most other english speakers , `` asian '' generally connotes east asian , with `` south asian '' or `` subcontinental '' being used to refer to people from the indian subcontinent . 
  obviously east asian , south asian , and middle eastern are as different from each other as they are from `` white '' , generally speaking . 
  they mainly get lumped together by terminology as a matter of convenience for the average white english speaking person . 
   if you were born at any point after the sixth century ,, 
  well , good thing for me i 'm fourteen hundred and fifty years old . 
  nah , this was true in australia for a time , as well . 
  in vietnam , cops regularly ( especially around t\u1ebft ) pull people over . 
  they 're not rbts like you might expect elsewhere , or pulling you up for breaking a law . 
  they do it completely and unambiguously to get a bribe . 
  if you refuse to pay they 'll find some tiny infraction or make one up to fine you . 
  and the fine is way worse than the relatively modest bribe you would pay . 
  but even weirder , one time my family was trying to import some personal items from overseas . 
  they were held up at customs , and we received an * email * that said `` the import duty is x , or you can pay a bribe of x/100 '' . 
  they actually said , in writing , pay us a bribe and we 'll waive the import duty . 
  it 's honestly crazy how high the lower level corruption is over there . 
  and of course the higher level corruption , the type that exists even in less corrupt countries , also takes place a lot more in vietnam . 
   i never said australia was not diverse , it is just less in comparison to the us . 
   australia does not have a highly mixed society, 
  your exact words . 
  but even so , the data tells that australia * is * more diverse than america . 
  caucasian normally gets used to mean `` white '' , but i * believe * it can also technically refer to arabs , iranians , and even south asians . 
  i 've never heard of it being used for south east asians ( who are , as a whole , more alike to ( north ) east asians than to subcontinentals ) . 
  i 'm just really hoping they cover the bizarre ads dominoes is putting out at the moment . 
  `` when we get told our customer service is bad , it really hurts '' . 
  like * what * it was never in my head that you may have had bad customer service , but now it is !, 
  what on earth brought them to do that, 
  races do n't really exist as a strict biological thing . 
  they 're mostly a cultural concept . 
  there was one early guy who thought the three main races were caucasoid , mongoloid , and negroid , but that kind of thinking has mostly been thrown out these days , in favour of `` genomic and population based perspective , and [ scientists and anthropologists ] have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors '' . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasian_race ), 
  yeah i do n't see ads much either . 
  i watched a lot of tv recently while my parents were visiting , but outside of that it gets turned on a handful of times per year , mostly for sports or election coverage . 
  i wish i could find that ad on youtube to share it . 
  it 's really quite bizarre . 
  not even `` bad '' so much as just ... confounding .
