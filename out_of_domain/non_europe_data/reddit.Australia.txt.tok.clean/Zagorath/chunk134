  that means a small advancement . 
  conversely , a huge improvement and/or paradigm shift would e called a ** r ** evolutionary upgrade . 
  just call it metro and do n't worry . 
  they 're not going to do anything about it . 
  unless ms comes out with a catchy new name that you could use to easily distinguish . 
  if that happens , no reason not to use it . 
  i misunderstood you . 
  i thought when you said `` it is n't an evolutionary upgrade '' what you meant was `` it is n't a huge improvement '' . 
  no , you were exactly right . 
  telling the instructions to a trained monkey , who then goes out and buys the cds and puts them in a cd player , would be better than the scroll wheel . 
  on imgur you can change the url to end in a different file format and it will still be the same :, 
  well , you 'd have to be pretty thick to try this , and if your head is thick , that means it 's dense , and if it 's dense , it has a greater mass . 
  if it has a greater mass , the centre of mass will be closer to the head . 
  it 's still not perfect , but it 's better .

   the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics , abilities , or qualities specific to that race , especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races .

  does their app allow you to view all sites on the web without needing to scroll , or if you do need to scroll , then through a method similar to this one ? 
  yeah , i figured . 
  what i wanted to know was what `` thinking outside the box '' entailed , specifically . 
  google buzz was basically twitter , but without the character limit , and with in-line commenting . 
  but you could have just used gmail 's awesome filtering to fix that problem !, 
  actually , it used to . 
  i know a person whose last name is easter , and when she first signed up for facebook , because it 's a name that seems like a prank name , she had to provide proof that was her real name . 
  i really wanted to use g + , but because my friends would n't switch , i gave up on it , except for the occasional planned hangout . 
  then they came out with communities , and it 's not quite what i wanted , but now at least i can subscribe to communities about things that i 'm interested in , and i get some awesome interaction with strangers . 
  it 's kinda like reddit with chronological posts rather than the complicated karma system . 
  ( and without anonymity , but that 's not really an issue here . ), 
  lucky bugger . 
  i would love to be in your situation , but my friends have n't switched . 
  i still get to have some good interaction from the new communities , though , so that 's a plus . 
  i suppose , but there was no subreddit-type system , more of a follower-based model . 
  can someone give a decent explanation of einstein 's cosmological principle ?

  how does that first one work ? 
  it seems interesting , but i do n't quite understand it . 
  uhh , you do ... 
  in-line comments , not threaded like reddit . 
  nah no worries . 
  it 's complicated terminology . 
  jesus , i 've never taken italian and i can tell you `` or '' is `` o '' . 
  based on what op said the actual translation was , i 'd say a correct poster would be `` morto o vivo '', 
  i did n't see his post before he deleted it , but i 'll respond based on a guess . 
  my italian knowledge is mostly limited to musical terminology , as well as a few words i picked up when i went there for holiday , but neither of those mattered in my ability to translate this poster . 
  what did matter was the french i know . 
  morte is dead , de is of , and vive is alive . 
  thus , i would have realised that italian is very similar , and would have translated the poster as `` dead of alive '' . 
  not quite correct , but pretty close . 
  edit : and , of course , the same can be done from spanish . 
  in fact , i think spanish has more similarities with italian than french does . 
  tomorrow , when the war began . 
  right , that 's the problem . 
  saying `` i could care less '' is completely vague . 
  it could be anything from a 1 to a 10 ( if we take only integers ) on a scale of 0 -- 10 . 
  `` i could care less '' is utterly useless for telling anything of value . 
  actually mozart was asking god to ask him anything because he is literally better than god . 
  at my high school they tuned their baby grand piano before every concert , and that meant three times per year . 
  of course , being in vietnam the labour cost of getting it tuned professionally would be way cheaper than many places , so a school 's budget is able to afford that much more easily than it would in a western country . 
  i definitely agree with this , but honestly if he feels he 's able to get the pieces out in time and without adding too much stress , then he certainly should n't be discouraged from doing so . 
  to op , if you decide you do n't have the time to do it yourself , but still want something completely fresh , you could try asking / r/composer to write something . 
  as others have mentioned , you need to consider whether you are going to be able to complete these pieces in time and without too much stress . 
  however , that does n't address your question directly . 
  if you do decide you 're able to complete them yourself ( or maybe you could do a couple yourself and find already existing pieces to add to that ) , i ca n't imagine you would have trouble finding someone to play it . 
  as long as you give them ample time to rehearse the music in advance you should be fine . 
  i would suggest that perhaps a smaller and less well-known ensemble would be more likely to want to do this kind of thing than a more well-known , already established quartet who may not want to risk their reputation . 
  i 'm not a professional in the filed , though , so take this with a grain of salt . 
  in modern music there are three types of clefs : c clefs , g clefs , and f clefs . 
  on [ c clefs ] ( http://www.signnetwork.com/decals/decals/symbols/images/symbol%20 ( 140 ) . jpg ) the middle of the shape marks middle c ( c4 ) . 
  on [ f clefs ] ( http://music4four.com/images/bass_clef2.bmp ) tho two dots mark the f below middle c. 
  on [ g clefs ] ( http://patersonmusic.net/images/clip%20art/gclef.jpg ) the bulge at the bottom marks the g above middle c. 
  thus , if a certain type of clef moves up so that its marked location is on a higher line , the range will be lower , for example the [ tenor clef ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/tenor_clef_ledger_lines.svg ) is a line higher than the [ alto clef ] ( http://muzikologija.ff.uni-lj.si/ptg/2/nota2/media/images/alto_clef_notenames.gif ) , and represents a lower sound . 
  to be able to smoothly decipher them , i would suggest working off of intervals rather than individual notes . 
  you should be able to easily see , for example , that a fifth is two lines , and a fourth is a line and a space . 
  work out the first note exactly and then just follow the intervals intuitively . 
  this should work for transposing instruments as well . 
  maybe that should be in the sidebar along with / r/classicalmemes and / r/classicalresources, 
  yeah , when people usually say `` classical music '' they are referring to music of the `` common practice period '' , which covers the baroque ( 1600 ~ 1750 , includes the likes of bach and vivaldi ) , classical ( 1750 ~ 1803 , includes mozart and haydn , as well as early beethoven ) , and romantic ( 1803 ~ 1900 , includes late beethoven , tchaikovsky , rachmaninov ) . 
  some 20th century music , particularly those of more tonal composers like stravinsky and satie , is also referred to as classical music . 
  i make the distinction between the broader classical music and the specific classical era by using capital or lowercase c , but this of course is n't always clear . 
  there 's no perfect solution . 
  why do you hope that ? 
  many people just enjoy composing , and would be willing to do something for a stranger just because it gives them a specific target . 
  that said , i definitely was n't suggesting op should look for handouts , either . 
  if he asks someone else to compose , he should be expecting that it will cost something , but also not averse to taking it for free if someone offers . 
  well , all i have to say is fuck those people . 
  that is all . 
  what 's the context of this ? 
  based on the top of the picture it looks like a maths test , but in that case what were you expecting students to put to impress you ? 
  based on comments i 've seen from players , it seems as though it 's not so much fun as addicting .
