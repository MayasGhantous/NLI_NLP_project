  unfortunately i have n't been able to . 
   the $ 5-a-day rate was about half pay and half bonus . 
  the bonus came with character requirements and was enforced by the socialization organization . 
  this was a committee that would visit the employees ' homes to ensure that they were doing things the `` americanway . '', 
  they were supposed to avoid social ills such as gambling and drinking . 
  they were to learn english , and many ( primarily the recent immigrants ) had to attend classes to become `` americanized . '', 
  women were not eligible for the bonus unless they were single and supporting the family . 
  also , men were not eligible if their wives worked outside the home . 
  ive found that in the latest seasons it 's been done in a very self-aware manner which made it come across as charming more than tedious .

  i was born in 567 . 
  out of interest , is this the reason that , between 0501 and 0846 on 2017-08-09 ( either utc or utc +10 , i 'm assuming ; not entirely sure how i 've got my logger set up ) , i got a couple dozen critical errors saying `` redirect to / notification/unread / '' and '' < class ` prawcore.exceptions.redirect '  '' ? 
  if so , wow , i 'm amazed at how quickly this error got fixed . 
  could you make it `` pop '' ? 
  the person who uploaded the other panels from that convention ( heather ferris ) commented ( on the patrick stewart solo panel ) that she will `` be posting it later '' . 
  it looks like there 're a * lot * of panels , and she 's trying to put them up gradually . 
  you should see the guy 's follow up comments and pms ... it 's basically a more extreme version of the comment you just made , but with zero self-awareness or sarcasm .

  yeah i 'm sorry mate . 
  we 're pretty loose with citations and copyright on this subreddit usually . 
  but there 's no way we can allow reproductions of material straight out of the player 's handbook . 
  stuff from unearthed arcana articles , we 'll allow ( though you may face a takedown from wotc legal ) , but the printed content is a step too far . 
  i 'm removing this post . 
  in australia , except for medicine , it 's * entirely * about grades . 
  you do n't have to do any of that bullshit writing about yourself like you do in the uk or us . 
  your ib score is converted to atar . 
  in some cases , extra atar points might be awarded based on certain subjects ( for example , i got enough extra points for doing maths hl and taking a second language that i was boosted from a queensland op3 to an op1 ) . 
  it 's a much more efficient and streamlined process , without any of that wishy-washiness . 
  i 'm assuming you 're coming at this from an american perspective , but i 'll answer from my experience from other countries . 
  where i live currently , you are not required by law to cross at a zebra crossing . 
  as long as you are at least 20 & nbsp ; m away from a marked crossing ( or , obviously , exactly on the crossing ) you are legally allowed to cross the road at any point . 
  it 's often more convenient to go to a marked crossing , because if there are cars coming , they 'll stop if you even * look * like you * might * go across it , at a crossing . 
  at other places , you could be standing there waiting for hours and they wo n't stop for you . 
  but if there 's a large natural break in traffic * anyway * , why * would n't * you cross ? 
  often , for me , the thought process is this : `` i can cross right now , and make it across with no cars anywhere near me , and i can be completely safe and not bother anyone . 
  or i can walk 20 & nbsp ; m down to the zebra crossing , and then those cars in the distance will be closer , and they 'll have to stop for me , which is inconvenient for them . '', 
  also , in other countries i 've lived in , such as vietnam , crossing at a zebra crossing is just as dangerous as anywhere else . 
  none of the drivers give a damn about whether they 're supposed to stop for you or not . 
  you just go . 
  do so slowly but with purpose , and they 'll all steer around you . 
  but in that context , the very notion of using a zebra crossing because it 's safer is absurd . 
  ah , i do that sometimes too . 
  if cars are * already * stopped on one side of the road , and i want to race across so as not to force them to wait any longer . 
  i do n't see where . 
  but anyway , that 's beside the point . 
  you ca n't reproduce entire classes , including all of their subclasses , from published and printed d&d products which can only be legally obtained by paying $ 60 , and expect to share that with people . 
  it 's piracy , plain and simple . 
  the default app thing is the main reason i 'm an android user to be honest . 
  most of the fancy customisation stuff does n't really matter one lick to me . 
  i do n't really care about widgets , or installing apps from outside the app store , or rooting/roming . 
  i just like google chrome , google inbox , google maps , and google calendar . 
  not the apple equivalents . 
  yeah , let 's see if we can get our buddies the us to nuke 'em for us !, 
   that zagorath guy is a bit suspicious .

  [ here 's a bunch of maths i did a few days ago re . 
  freefall ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 6sz8uj/rules _ on_falling_question / dlgrfqg / ? context = 3 ) . 
  the tl ; dr is : you fall about 504 & nbsp ; feet in 6 & nbsp ; seconds , in the freefall skydiving position . 
  if you 're interested in realism , 59d6 should be the cap . 
  you reach 36d6 after 360 feet ( i.e. , 1d6 per 10 ft until 36d6 ) , but after that point air resistance means you accelerate quite a bit more slowly . 
  you finally reach 59d6 at 1400 feet . 
  note that this is assuming an average mass human in the spread-eagled skydiving freefall position . 
  in a more streamlined position , or carrying more mass , air resistance will have less effect , resulting in a faster acceleration and higher terminal velocity . 
  but it seems a pretty reasonable assumption to make for the sake of some rough , consistent rules . 
  ( for ultra-realism , a halfling rogue probably does n't have a lot of mass themselves , and probably wears/carries only relatively light things . 
  so they should accelerate a lot less , and therefore take a lot less damage , than a goliath paladin , who is incredibly massive themselves , and wearing heavy plate armour and carrying lots of other heavy stuff . 
  but if you want that , you 'll have to work out the formulae yourself . ), 
  adam bandt is still member for melbourne . 
  perhaps you 're thinking of scott ludlum , former senator for western australia ? 
  actually from what i 've read , there 's some case law which suggests a country * could n't * do this sort of thing . 
  that if it is a reasonable scenario where the person can not avoid having the citizenship , it would not be in violation of s44 ( i ) . 
  it does n't increase acceleration due to gravity , but it * does * *** decrease *** the effect of air resistance on that acceleration . 
  this is the reason that , when you drop a feather and a bowling ball , on earth , they fall at such vastly different rates , even though in a vacuum they would fall at the same rate . 
  this episode had a line that said it had been a few years since sam let bran north of the wall .

  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments or submissions unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  do n't worry about the flairs too much . 
  it 's frequently unclear exactly what something should be tagged . 
  as for the question , it 's because pineapple is a delicious fruit on its own , but it tastes fucking terrible when cooked with stuff .
