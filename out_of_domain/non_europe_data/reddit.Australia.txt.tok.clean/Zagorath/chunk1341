  it is an abomination . 
   danaerys may be the daughter of the last targaryen king , but jon is his grandson , and being a legitimate male , he 's next in line . 
  this , in isolation , does * not * necessarily mean he would be next in line . 
  it 's specifically , as the comment you replied to mentioned , the fact that jon is the son of the previous king 's ** son ** . 
  if he had been the son of someone who was further back in the lineage than danaerys ( i.e. , a daughter younger than dany ) , even though jon is a male , he could have still been later in the line of succession . 
  still ( as far as people know ) a bastard . 
  ( and also , if they did know , a targaryen , not a stark . 
  so no claim to winterfell . ), 
  it 's a very well studied effect and a basic hci principle . 
  whitespace helps users parse information better , by allowing them to instinctively group things together appropriately . 
   the design is nice , but the reliability needs a lot of polishing . 
  that 's a really good way to put it . 
  dark mode is lovely . 
  * but you ca n't edit your watch later playlist ( and i assume other playlists , but wl is the only one i use ) from the wl page , without getting shoved into the old interface . 
  * scrolling through a playlist off to the side of a watch page does n't steal focus on the scroll , which means if you just wanted to scroll to the bottom of your current playlist , you instead get shunted down to the bottom of the whole page . 
  * notification system still not fixed . 
  * in fact , notification system made worse , since if you click on one and get taken to the watch page , it * used * to at * least * automatically pause the video for you . 
  now you have to manually pause it . 
  * like numbers expressed only in '' #k '' , and it does n't even tell you the exact number on hover . 
  one thing that they seem to have fixed that the old ux did wrong is that you now no longer get looped back to the start of a playlist if you finish a the last video in the playlist and you 've already removed it . 
  that is such a relief . 
  yeah i agree . 
  not even close . 
  probably yes . 
  the only reason it 's `` probably '' is because i 'm tempted to boycott . 
  it 's stupid that this thing is happening and i really hope the high court throws it out for being inappropriate use of funds ( since they 're using money which was appropriated for use in `` unforeseen '' circumstances ) , or for being an inappropriate request to make of the abs . 
  but if it * is n't * thrown out , there 's a strong temptation to make the result invalid through a large-scale boycott . 
  they ca n't claim it 's the will of the people if they know a lot of people boycotted . 
  but i 'll probably vote yes if it goes ahead , because at this point it does n't look like there 's a substantial boycott movement , and boycotting does n't work if you 're the only one doing it . 
  my main hope though , for sure , is that the court does n't let this hate-filled waste of money go ahead at all . 
  you 'll need access to a windows machine to do it , but if you can get the drive in an external enclosure , a copy of [ spinrite ] ( https://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm ) should do the job . 
  it 's been known to work absolute marvels . 
  it should get your current drive working just a little bit longer , and allow you to copy stuff off of it . 
  but you ** do ** need to get the stuff * off * it . 
  if your drive has shown it 's in the process of dying , the best spinrite can do is extend its life a little , and you do n't want to be in a bad position later on once it 's completely given up . 
  just do n't judge it on the ... outdatedness , to put it politely ... of the website . 
  the dev is a really ... particular -- again , to put it politely ... kinda guy , but for something as low-level and finnicky as data recovery software , that 's exactly what you need . 
  a lot of data recovery places will do little more than running spinrite themselves and charge an exuberant mark-up . 
   why not make the state proper secular and remove marriage from our legal framework altogether, 
  because marriage is n't a religious thing and this myth needs to die . 
   apparently there letting 16/17 year olds have their say, 
  it 's unclear at this point . 
  the wording the government used technically means that yes , 16/17 year olds should be surveyed as well , but it was probably their intent to * not * allow this , and they may look for a way out of it . 
   both of the people who indicated they are leaning no have been downvoted, 
  apparently even saying you 're thinking about possibly , * maybe * , just if a lot of other people do it too , * boycotting * the whole farcical survey is enough to get downvoted , even if you 're very clear that your vote is most likely going to be yes , and definitely not going to be no . 
   unfortunately not enough people are boycotting to make it a proper boycott though, 
  which , if you had read my comment properly , would make it entirely clear means i 'll vote yes . 
  * i 'm * the one being a jerk about it ? 
  i 'm not the one that 's been a part of heavily downvoting someone for speaking an entirely clear and sensible strategy . 
   perhaps i did n't see it as perfectly clear that you were really going to be actually voting or what your idea of a boycott was . 
  hmm ? 
   but i 'll probably vote yes if it goes ahead , because at this point it does n't look like there 's a substantial boycott movement , and boycotting does n't work if you 're the only one doing it . 
  as i said in my first reply to you , * if you had read my comment properly * , it would have been entirely clear . 
   no-one 's measuring boycotts though, 
  those in favour of marriage equality could argue quite strongly without data just based on any vocal outspoken campaigns that may occur . 
  it does n't really need to be strongly backed by data for it to work as a campaign tactic for labor and the greens at the next election . 
  but there * will * be data on non-completion . 
  this will , in truth , represent not only boycotts , but also those too lazy to send in their opinion , those who can not work out how to use mail , those who never receive the mail ( either because they are away or the mail system fucks up ) and those who genuinely have no opinion . 
  but again , labor and the greens could use that politically and say `` 30 % ( or whatever ) of people were not polled by the liberals ' deliberate attempt to produce a low-quality survey '' , and those in favour of marriage equality , as well as possibly some who are more on the fence , will recognise the truth in that . 
  australia 's constitution does not allow someone who is a dual citizen to be a member of parliament ( equivalent to your congresspeople -- although our executive also comes directly out of parliament ) . 
  recently , a lot of members have suddenly discovered that through some weird technicalities , they are actually dual citizens of various countries . 
  the first of these , a senator for the greens , was discovered to be a dual citizen of new zealand . 
  barnaby joyce is a member of a party very much opposed to the greens , and when this was discovered , he was incredibly rude about it . 
  now , it seems , it has been discovered that joyce * himself * is * also * a new zealand citizen . 
  `` haka-la-vista '' is a reference to the haka , a maori war dance popular for being performed by nz sports teams before games . 
  and `` baa-naby '' is referencing sheep , because that animal is associated with nz . 
  same with `` ewe have got to be joking '' . 
  `` joyce as bro '' references a common phrase stereotypically associated with new zealanders , `` nice as bro '' . 
  hope that explains everything . 
  edit : `` choice as bro '' , not `` nice as bro '' , apparently . 
  the point of a boycott is that the anti-ssm crew 's argument would be completely irrelevant . 
  anyone can simply dismiss it as an invalidated survey , and the results can be tossed out . 
  sure , maybe the anti-ssm crew will feel legitimised , but that 's irrelevant once labor gets into parliament , because they can campaign knowing that the survey was bunk , and get in to parliament with a mandate to enact marriage equality . 
  if the survey turned up a `` no '' vote * without * a boycott , it would be politically untenable to raise the issue again too soon . 
  but if everyone knows that it was boycotted by a large portion of supporters , we can go again straight away . 
  the big difference with brexit is that there was a legitimate reason for the poll to be conducted in the way it was , and not done simply as an act of parliament . 
  it was also a case where the protest votes were largely * not * boycotts , but definitive votes in one particular direction . 
  that argument is more like if i were to say `` i 'm protesting this stupid poll by voting ` no ' even though i believe in marriage equality '' , which is not what i 'm saying . 
  i did n't hear about any substantial boycott movement over the brexit vote , and it 's only able to be a successful boycott if it is made * entirely * clear to the public * before * the vote that there are a lot of people going to boycott this poll . 
  it also works in favour of marriage equality that a `` no '' vote is essentially `` status quo '' , i.e. , things will not get materially worse if the no vote wins . 
  another vote can be done later ( preferably in parliament and not involving the public directly , but theoretically it could also be a plebiscite or a `` survey '' ) with relative ease . 
  the winning result in brexit was a vote * for * change , which makes it impossible to just `` try again later '' , as it were . 
  ah cheers mate . 
  i guess i 'm not quite as up-to-date with kiwi slang as i could be . 
  al is literally ** full ** of stupid rules . 
  it 's honestly just a straight-up * bad * idea to be a part of al unless that 's the * only * way you can get a game . 
  that would also solve our other current ongoing political fuckery . 
  wait , you guys do n't get vision ? 
  at all ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  here in australia we also do n't get dental , but we * do * have at least some vision . 
  i 'm not sure of the extent of it , but at the very least eye exams to determine whether you need glasses , or for things like cataracts , are free . 
  still got ta pay out the arse for those glasses though . 
  we also have the big spaces and bad native treatment problems . 
  our telcos are n't * great * , but if you 're a smart shopper you can go with smaller companies -- mvnos -- there are some great deals to be had . 
  but we have the separate problem that our government completely fucked up the process of upgrading our home internet , leaving us with outdated , more expensive , and slower tech than we should have had ... 
  luckily we got rid of fptp long ago . 
  because given our current state of politics , there 's no way we would get it through . 
  if you 're interested , you can see the current list of moderators in the sidebar . 
  technically , the way it works is a strict hierarchy based on the order they were added .
