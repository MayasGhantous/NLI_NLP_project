  mods higher up the list are able to remove mods from lower down , or decrease their permissions ( e.g make it so they can approve and remove posts , but not edit the subreddit 's sidebar , etc. 
  ) , but mods can not remove higher ranking mods . 
  that 's a rough generalisation . 
  there are some more specific things relating to how each of the different permissions a mod can have work , but that 's the gist of it . 
  it really is . 
  but this subreddit , and quite a lot of others , seem to hate the idea . 
   is it \\ r ? 
  is it \\ n ? 
  is it \\ r \\ n, 
  the good thing is , it 's never \\ r , because even the most hardened of backward-compatible projects is never going to have to support classic macos . 
   to dissuade over-use, 
  not sure that 's the reason for all of them . 
  * identify * , for example , has a one-time cost and does n't need to be paid each time the spell is used . 
  i know * revivify * is definitely a per-use cost , but i 'm not sure about * find familiar * . 
  this is a really great question , but you 'll get a better response to it if you ask on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  specifically , you 'll want to ask in [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 6tma82/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas / ) . 
  oooh , i love shardminds . 
  and i 'm so glad to see that your incarnation of it uses the same lore as the 4e version , because that lore is what makes them so compelling . 
  in terms of balance , here 's how i would break it down . 
  asi : 3.25 ( for flexibility ), 
  psych resist : 0.5, 
  immune to disease : 0.5, 
  no need to sleep : 0.5, 
  60 ft telepathy : 1 ( since you must share a language ), 
  shardswarm is hard to judge , but i 'd say : 1.5 . 
  disadvantage on opportunity attacks is probably about +1 , and i 'd say being able to move through tiny spaces gets you the extra +0.5 . 
  that 's a total of 7.25 , which makes it among the most powerful races , but not * more * powerful than them . 
  you have a couple of problems with wording , notably in shardswarm where it says, 
   you are capable of moving through spaces that a tiny creature could move through so long as a single shard could reasonably fit through that space, 
  this feels like redundant information . 
  there are also at least two obvious typographical errors in this sentence :, 
   each shardmind , in fact . 
  is a fragment ofdivine power and carries a responsibility to nurture that power . 
  shardswarm also raises the question of : how exactly do you move ? 
  can you fly ? 
  how high above the ground can you get ? 
  just a simple mention of something like `` the crystal shards making up your body hover at roughly the same height as your humanoid form would stand '' would help clear this up without impacting balance . 
  i 'm a little bit uneasy about the structure of the shardmind psionics feat . 
  a feat giving different abilities based on level ? 
  it 's very strange . 
  especially since you can only * get * the feat at 4th level at the earliest . 
  otherwise , i quite like these feats . 
  i fundamentally agree with the overall approach , although i still maintain that the decision to multiply by 4 was a mistake . 
  working out how strong things are as a multiple of an asi is a really simple and intuitive way of going about things , so setting that to +1 just makes sense . 
  it makes remembering what different things are worth in one 's head much easier . 
  there are only one or two other existing parts of the document that i would change . 
  i agree with most of the balance choices you 've made . 
  in particular , i think you 've done a great job of working out an appropriate value for such controversial things as flight , natural weapons & unarmed strikes , and small size . 
  i 'd certainly like to have a go at adding in some more options , including those currently listed under `` still needed '' and some of the ua races which have not yet been assessed . 
  as for my credentials , [ here ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) is the only race i 've designed myself . 
  it includes a detect balance & ndash ; based self-assessment at the end . 
  here , also , are a few reviews i 've done for / r/boh5e using the detect balance scale . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 50rz70/merfolk _ by_uquietsci / d7bc560 / ) , [ [ 2 ] ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 5bdib0/modron _ race_by_umessy6 / dahm5t5 / ) , [ [ 3 ] ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 5rqrje/large _ races_by_uswordmeow / demeol8 / ) , and my most recent review on / r/unearthedarcana [ [ 4 ] ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 6tnfdj/the _ shardmind_a_crystalline_race_from_4e / dln7am4 / ) . 
  there 's no mathematical difference between a +1 to hit and a +1 to spell save dc . 
  the only practical difference is that with the dc monsters roll to save against it , while with an attack roll players roll to hit . 
  such an ability is absolutely fine to include , as long as it 's careful not to get into a situation where a bunch of different abilities stack . 
  it 's weaker than the archery fighting style , which gives a + ** 2 ** , at level 1 . 
  this guy 's talking about a +1 at level 15 . 
  there 's absolutely know way that 's broken on its own . 
   what justification is there for a half caster to cast more lethal spells than any full caster ? 
  well , we have n't seen that . 
  and certainly , i would n't presume that it 's necessarily a good * thematic * design without seeing the context . 
  but i can imagine it might be possible . 
  maybe the caster 's deal is that it is very careful with how it uses its magic . 
  they take their time to get it * right * , but at the cost of not being able to do as much . 
  really , it 's kinda irrelevant to this conversation . 
  we were given a question about whether a mechanic is acceptable in the abstract . 
  we have to then * assume * the flavour is fine , and determine whether , for pure balance reasons , it 's acceptable . 
  if we see a class with its flavour , * then * we can judge whether the mechanics match the flavour or not . 
  but it 's stupid to * assume * ludo-narrative dissonance where no narrative has been explained . 
  so ... uh , when does this show come back , exactly ? 
   i 'm unfamiliar with the musicus scale, 
  i was using detect balance . 
  musicus has been entirely replaced by db , as far as i can tell . 
  i do n't think anyone uses musicus anymore . 
  i just do n't use the borked version of it where every value is arbitrarily multiplied by 4 . 
   one thing missing from your calculations is a synergy penalty caused by the asi 's [ sic ], 
  i do n't believe one is warranted . 
  in fact , i 'm not sure i believe one is ** ever ** warranted for asis . 
  but certainly , it would not offset the * benefit * of flexibility , which is why i chose 3.25 rather than just 3 . 
  i can * maybe * see a synergy penalty for asis where no choice is given * and * there 's a synergy penalty , but not when you have flexibility as well . 
   there was an issue with the fact that the shardmind could fit through the same space as a spider , so i had to reword it to be limited to the size of a rat instead . 
  i would remove the stuff about `` tiny '' sized , and * only * have the description of it as being like a rat . 
   any ideas [ re feats ] ? 
  my main suggestion would be : do not assume weird homebrew rules which result in massive balance changes when designing something . 
  consider only standard or common rules , or ones that do n't necessarily affect balance . 
  you can also consider some specific homebrew options that your creation is designed to mesh with , but that does n't seem to be the case here . 
  i might also suggest a level minimum , if you want to keep it close to the same as it currently is . 
  say that you must have a `` character level of 5 '' to take this feat . 
  that way they can take it with their second feat choice , or their first if they multiclass one level . 
  but most of all , i would say that giving out a bunch of spells that are above 1st level spells is not a good design for a feat . 
  where possible , you should stick to cantrips and 1st level spells to be given out as a feat . 
  that 's a number of different options you could take , all of which would be better than the current design , but not all of which are equally good . 
  bad bot, 
  i mean ... that 's not actually all that hard . 
  it 's highschool level maths . 
  i know the joke is that if you pass it , you must be a robot . 
  but it kinda falls apart when the question is one that an advanced 16 year old can complete . 
  the answer , by the way , is zero . 
  d/dx 2sin ( 6x + pi/2 ) = 12cos ( 6x + pi/2 ),
