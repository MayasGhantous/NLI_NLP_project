  at x = 0 , that 's 12cos ( pi/2 ) , which is 0 . 
  the main one is simply the fact that dms are n't allowed to actually run the game , they have to stick to the script . 
  but there are certainly others , like the needless arbitrary rules about what sort of characters are legal . 
  you ca n't play certain races at all . 
  you can play others ( even though their balance is absolutely terrible ) , but only with certain restrictions . 
  you ca n't play certain alignments at all , or others only if you 're a part of certain factions . 
  you can play certain character options , but not in certain combinations because of arbitrary restrictions on where you can get your player options from . 
  even worse , because of this last rule in al & mdash ; a vastly inferior form of d&d for the aforementioned reasons & mdash ; it seems as though the actual * main form of the game * is being designed in such a limited and needlessly restrictive way , resulting in some options becoming essentially orphans , or other options being designed in a thematically less appropriate manner in order to accommodate the bullshit al rules . 
  i 'm not intimately familiar with all the rules , because i figured out very quickly that it 's an incredibly hostile environment to play in and did n't bother figuring out the details . 
  but i believe there are also rules on what sort of items you 're allowed to get , and what you 're allowed to do with them . 
  but those first two paragraphs are the real game breakers . 
   works just like whatsapp . 
  phone needs to be connected for it to work, 
  this bullshit is why i do n't use what 's app , and it 's why i 'm still not going to use allo . 
  i do n't want to use my phone number as the account id for something that is n't an actual phone service . 
  and i * definitely * do n't want to use social clout trying to get people to switch to something that uses this bullshit model . 
  this needs to use your google account . 
  yup , this is exactly the problem with it . 
  using phone number as the id is an inherently flawed system , because phone numbers are much further from a one-to-one relationship with a person and their devices than email addresses are . 
  people have multiple devices . 
  phone numbers are intrinsically tied to a single device . 
  it 's an awful clumsy hack to try to use phone number for anything that is meant to be designed to reach a * person * , rather than reach a * device * . 
   one of google 's smartest ideas for a multi-platform messenger imo, 
  you had my blood boiling for a second there , until, 
  you mean like let them choose spells in the same way a wizard does ? 
  it 's not a great idea . 
  their high flexibility is one of the main strengths of the wizard . 
  one of their most important selling points . 
  if that is n't unique to them , they become a lot less interesting . 
  and stepping on the toes of existing material is a * big * no-no in the homebrew community . 
  it also , for the warlock , kinda does n't fit with their theme . 
  warlocks get spells that are given to them by their patron , it does n't make thematic sense for them to be able to pick up and learn literally any spell they come across . 
   of course it will vary with the sort of game you are making , and the consequences of failure, 
  indeed . 
  for d&d the 60 & ndash ; 75 % figure makes a lot of sense . 
  but call of cthulhu encourages its horror and investigative side by having common success rates be around 20 & ndash ; 60 % , most characters will only have maybe one or two skills higher than that . 
  and dread has the fascinating but very effective method of starting out very easy , but getting gradually more and more difficult as the game goes on , and the consequence for a single failure is literally death , which does an * excellent * job of emphasising the horror theme . 
  yeah it really just is two bars that have anything even remotely complicated in terms of harmony . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  i have a phone , a laptop , and a desktop . 
  many people have that , plus a tablet . 
  maybe multiple of some of those . 
  only one of those has a phone number . 
  a not insignificant amount of people have two separate ** phones ** . 
  some people do n't have a phone number , or do n't like to give it out too easily . 
  but the most important thing is that a phone number is * intrinsically * linked to a single device , and people use multiple different devices that they want to connect from . 
   phones are widely used for 2nd factor authentication, 
  widely regarded by security experts as poor form . 
  sms 2fa is still better than no 2fa , but it 's substantially worse than time-based tokens ( which may just happen to run , most often , on a phone ) . 
  but even then , it 's a completely different use case . 
  2fa is designed to increase security by being able to prove that you have a thing that , for the most part , only you will have . 
  you only need one device to represent you over all your devices . 
  but that 's used to help you log in to the thing * on multiple devices * . 
  you need an account that 's generally useful across multiple devices , not one per device . 
   e2e encryption work ( which is n't turned on by default , which it absolutely should be ), 
  no it should n't . 
  the ** only ** selling point of allo is its inclusion of assistant . 
  and that ca n't work with end-to-end encryption . 
  they should n't by default turn off the most important unique feature of their platform . 
  it 's not too dissimilar from arguing that chrome should use incognito mode by default . 
  it should n't . 
  you turn it on for when you 're doing something where you want those features . 
  it 's not customisable . 
  it 's just 6 months . 
  always . 
  google provides value by connecting various services together . 
  adding calendar events automatically based on email , adding reminders from your phone into your calendar , sharing notifications across youtube and google , etc. 
  this does not . 
  what possible benefit could there be in using the same account for a video game streaming website , and a tabletop game character creator ? 
  maybe hypothetically there could be some weird edge case . 
  but they are not providing it now . 
  had they used amazon accounts instead ( since amazon owns twitch ) , there could have been value . 
  but they went the route of trying instead to shove their shitty unrelated product down the throats of people interested in a tabletop gaming product . 
  what do you think sumo wrestlers , or even forwards in rugby union , are ? 
   pretty much the same but they ca n't honour warranties over here, 
  under australian law , the seller is still ** required ** to honour your consumer guarantees , so at the very least you 've still got the ability to return it for a refund or replacement if fails within the normal lifetime of the product .
