  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair .

  actually with grey imports , [ the manufacturer * is n't * obligated to uphold consumer law ] ( https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/sales-delivery/buying-parallel-imports#your-rights-when-buying-parallel-imports ) , unlike with most purchases where the consumer can choose to go to either the manufacturer or the seller , and either would be obligated to help . 
  etymonline says `` root '' was first used as slang for `` penis '' in 1846 . 
  it does n't say * where * that use originated , and it does n't have any reference to the modern day australian use meaning `` fuck '' ( in both the literal sexual intercourse sense , but also other meanings of `` fuck '' ) , unfortunately . 
  but it 's possible that they 're related . 
  just a reminder of rule 3 . 
  if you 've released an updated version as a separate post ( as opposed to merely updating the existing post ) , you are required to delete the previous post , so as not to clutter up the subreddit 's front page . 
  classes are very , very difficult to balance . 
  there are a large number of specific guidelines that can be used to determine if a class is probably bad -- things like incorrect spell progression , two strong/weak saving throws , unorthodox asi spots , etc. 
  -- but they are only guidelines . 
  many of them can be legitimately broken if done with extreme caution by someone who understands fully the ramifications of their actions . 
  but even a class which passes all these guidelines can be problematic , if it is overtuned or undertuned in too many of its other abilities , and because of how widely class themes diverge , and how many levels there are to give abilities to , making a guide for it that could be all-encompasing is essentially impossible . 
   facilitating people streaming their tabletop and/or online game over this very service, 
  how , exactly ? 
  this is n't a virtual tabletop . 
  it 's just a character manager . 
  if they * had * built a vtt , the twitch integration might have been justifiable . 
  even then it would be ** really * stretching it , since the people who actually stream their stuff are such a ludicrously tiny minority of users that to fuck over * everyone else * because of it is a bit ridiculous , but at least they could have * claimed * some justification . 
  it 's called foreshortening . 
  it 's also the reason that ads painted on a sports field look normal on screen , but look weirdly stretched in real life . 
  not all the libs and nats are for it . 
  this page is n't saying `` all libs and nats are for it '' , it 's saying `` here we are , some lib and nats members , and we are for it '' . 
  yay agglutination !, 
  you 've got a lot of combat abilities , and a few abilities that might be argues to be exploration . 
  but as far as i can see , there are no social abilities . 
  it might be worth looking at that and seeing if you can make this class have abilities for all three pillars of the game . 
  i would be more than okay with cory bernardi , christopher pyne , and peter dutton also covering their faces . 
  burqa , paper bag , whatever . 
  i 'd just be happy not to have to see them or what they stand for on a daily basis . 
  i 'd add joyce there too , but really he should just resign . 
  also the poodle . 
  humans . 
  for flavour reasons i like worlds where humans are the majority ( or at the very least , humans and one other race combined make the majority ) . 
  and 5e does such a fantastic job of reinforcing that flavour , by making humans incredibly powerful by being the * only * race that gets a feat at level 1 . 
  the free feat also helps emphasise the human race 's flavour as being the most flexible and diverse of races , since there is a great variety in the types of abilities you can get through a feat . 
  most of / r/babyelephantgifs would also fit nicely in / r/bettereveryloop , imo . 
  very true . 
  it 's used in both of those senses . 
  in fact , it 's used in pretty much * all * the ways `` fuck '' could be used . 
  you could also say `` we 're rooted '' , as in `` we 're fucked '' , as in `` we 're in a bad situation '' . 
  so , the plot to the butterfly effect ? 
  kinda . 
  i really like your solution to jon 's journey to the wall . 
  it 's a simple little thing that can be done to help improve the verisimilitude of the show . 
  but unfortunately , that is n't always possible . 
  sometimes , the way events are structured makes it * necessary * that we interpret these things as just for some reason happening way faster than is believable . 
  for example the recent episode had dany decide to go with the dothraki to attack the loot train , then seemingly a few hours later she , and the dothraki , were there . 
  [ spoilers s07e06 ] ( / s `` even worse is the latest episode . 
  a raven gets from the wall to dragonstone , and then dany flies up north of the wall on a dragon , all in seemingly less than a single day . '' ), 
  there are probably other examples of the timing being a real narrative problem where some simple explanation of the amount of time taken would n't solve it , but i ca n't think of them at the moment . 
  it 's not something that ruins the whole show , by any means , but it certainly is a major distraction that breaks suspension of disbelief . 
   the men forcing them to wear them, 
  most women in australia wearing a burqa want to . 
  you could say that they 're brainwashed into wanting that by having grown up in a culture that expects that . 
  and to that i would say you 're 100 % correct . 
  but we ca n't legislate against people acting on their religious beliefs when it does n't harm anyone else . 
   tyrion appears on a hill above the battle between the lannister army and the dothraki/drogon . 
  i feel it insults my intelligence not to explain how he was able to catch up with dany on dragon back . 
  oh god yeah , that annoyed me so much . 
  how the hell is he supposed to have gotten there ? 
   she left dragonstone before him , airborne , to meet her army half a continent away, 
  i do n't think it 's * quite * that bad . 
  my understanding was that it 's only a few hours march outside of king 's landing at most . 
  it 's still too far to completely believe tyrion got there , if we assume ( as the show lead me to believe ) that it happened same day . 
  but i do n't think it 's quite half a continent away . 
  dragonstone to king 's landing is reasonably small distance , is n't it ? 
  you 've written that very well , but it 's unmarked spoilers so it will likely be ( quite rightly ) removed very soon . 
  see the sidebar for how to mark spoilers appropriately . 
  not if we use magic , 
  or ranged weapons . 
  that 's why i always downvote people who say that , regardless of the opinion itself . 
  same with `` please do n't upvote '' . 
  they 're either being genuine , in which case downvoting is fulfilling their wishes , or using it as bait because they know people upvote that shit . 
  remember , trending subreddits are manually chosen from a larger automatically generated list . 
  maybe / r/freefolk was in the shortlist , but the admins did n't choose it . 
  there might be any number of reasons for that . 
  they often like to craft little narratives with the trending subreddits , and maybe / r/freefolk did n't fit into that . 
  maybe the reason it 's grown so much relates to piracy , and the admins do n't really want to promote that . 
  we really ca n't know why . 
  but it 's certainly not unusual for a subreddit to see a lot of growth and yet not trend . 
  i 'd rather like to see a lili boulanger flair . 
  she 's a popular favourite composer of the orchestration online community . 
  [ here 's a link to the first of a currently 7-part series analysing some of her works ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjju1gpmkqw ) as an orchestrator , by thomas goss . 
   paul dukas, 
  do n't know if i 'd call him underknown . 
  sure , in popular culture he 's a bit of a one hit wonder , but that one hit is still ** huge ** . 
  anyway , since you 've mentioned him , i wonder if you could give some recommendations of some of his best works other than sorcerer 's apprentice ? 
  the abc , easy . 
  they have one or two very left leaning programmes ( qanda , for example ) , but their actual news reporting is consistently found by independent reports to be incredibly unbiased . 
  i mostly play [ tagpro ] ( http://tagpro-diameter.koalabeast.com/ ) these days .
