  yeah i thought that too . 
  i 've heard of `` x quintet '' being used to mean `` x plus string quartet '' , but i have n't heard the same of a quartet and string trio before . 
  quite an interesting ensemble , and it works surprisingly well here . 
  but anyway , i 'm not sure why it would n't work . 
  the bass flute might have to play most of the piece up an octave , but i think you could get much of the same effect out of it . 
  probably not ** as ** good as this version is , but i do n't think it 'd be so horrible that it does n't work at all . 
  i only saw it last monday . 
  i 'd say i really enjoyed it , but it definitely did drag a ** lot ** , especially in the first half . 
  took way too long to get to the interesting stuff . 
  gets a 10/10 for that post-credits scene , though .

  best of luck . 
  i 'm left eyed . 
  it 's a pain as a photographer , since all the buttons on the camera are designed assuming you 're right eyed , which means you end up covering a bunch of then with your face if you use your left eye . 
  but apparently eye and hand need to be the same dominance in order for you to be good at precision things like shooting . 
  so that 's cool , i guess . 
  my dad 's left eye dominant but right handed , so he 's buggered .

  you know what you want out of the class far better than i do . 
  levels 7 and 13 would be a good place to put them . 
  i do n't know if these were there or not when i made my last comment , but looking at it now , there seem to be a fair few non-combat abilities . 
  repair kit , tinkering skill ( at least partly & mdash ; these abilities could all be used in combat , but some of them also have non-combat utility ) , and tool expertise . 
  although i 'm a bit confused about tinkering skill ; you get a bunch of things at 2nd level that it tells you about , and it says you get more at some other levels ; but i do n't see any other abilities there . 
  not sure what 's up with that . 
  anyway , when you 're looking for more non-combat abilities that you can add , have a look through the player 's handbook for all the classes and subclasses . 
  also take a look at the ua artificer . 
  use those for inspiration about the types of abilities that might be worth giving , but try not to do much * direct * copying . 
  you feel worse about xenophon than the guy whose * mum * applied for citizenship on his behalf ? 
  i 'm inclined to believe it was an error o ntje italians ' part . 
  in fact , i 'm inclined , in is particular debacle , to believe the word of all of the politicians embroiled in it . 
  if any of them * knew * they had citizenship , why in the hells would they not renounce it before running ? 
  none of them have shown any actual allegiance with or care for a different country , and they all * knew * that having a second citizenship would disqualify them from parliament . 
  so what possible reason could any of them who knew about their second citizenship have had for not renouncing it ? 
  edit : holy shit when autocorrect fails it fails * hard * . 
  `` o ntje '' should have been `` on the '' . 
  so , exactly the same as xenophon and all the others , then ? 
  since this is a classical subreddit you 're posting on , i 'm gon na answer with an orchestral instrument . 
  the others answering classical guitar certainly have a good point , but my guess is that 's not what you want . 
  i 'm gon na focus mainly on their use in classical repertoire , but i 'll touch on folk and jazz music as well . 
  i 'd say flute or clarinet are quite possibly among the cheapest instruments . 
  brass instruments , double reeded instruments , and string instruments all tend to be quite costly . 
  it 's possible that you might be able to find a decent violin or trumpet at a reasonable cost though . 
  the clarinet is an excellent choice because not only is it widely used in western art music from the late classical period ( and especially starting with beethoven in the early romantic ) , but it also has excellent repertoire in jazz and eastern european folk music . 
  the flute has more classical repertoire , going back to the middle baroque period , or even further if you 're okay with playing works written for flauto dolce on the flauto traverso . 
  it 's also good for a lot of folk music , from western european all the way to eastern asian ( again assuming you 're okay with playing works written for similar but not quite the same instrument on your classical flute ) . 
  much more limited in terms of jazz . 
  trumpet has a good variety of classical stuff , although its use during the classical era proper had a tendency to be less interesting than the late romantic or during the baroque . 
  also a * king * in the jazz world , and you 've got military calls and stuff as well . 
  violin is perhaps the king of classical , with enormous use in all periods . 
  especially good is that it has a * much * wider variety of chamber repertoire than the other instruments & mdash ; string duos , trios , and quartets being far ** far ** more common than small ensembles using any other instruments . 
  great for european folk music as well . 
  not quite so great for jazz . 
  i do n't really * know * the prices of any of these except clarinet , so i 'm really just speculating on that . 
  but i believe these are likely to be among the best bang for your buck .

  requiems typically have some quieter parts as well , but they 're definitely full on pieces . 
  [ this page on / r/classicalresources , `` halloween/spooky/scary '' ] ( / r/classicalresources/comments / 13g721/themes _ halloweenspookyscary / ) is probably the best resource of a bunch of related pieces . 
  [ this one , `` angry '' ] ( / r/classicalresources/comments / 13g715/themes _ angry / ) might also have what you 're looking for . 
  less likely , but [ this one , `` sad/dark '' ] ( / r/classicalresources/comments / 13g764/themes _ saddark / ) could also have what you want . 
  it 's a response to / r/upvotedbecausegirl . 
  it only really makes sense in that context .
