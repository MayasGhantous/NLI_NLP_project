  yeah i would n't have known it was out either , except i got a banner ad for it on youtube for it . 
  i was surprised , since i did n't expect it for another month or so . 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  that 's in c minor , right ? 
   with a gym , showers , food court and bicycle parking, 
  for the cattle, 
  i 'm not a huge fan of the concept . 
  i do n't mind a warlock drawing power from a vampire , but i do n't like the idea that they would * be * a vampire in so doing , just like a fiend warlock does n't actually * become * a devil . 
  but the execution of the concept is pretty good . 
  the spells and 1st and 6th level abilities are great . 
  i 'm a little bit iffy on the improving damage of the bite attack , but it 's probably not * too * bad . 
  i * really * like the fact that it 's a melee spell attack . 
  the idea that the success of their attack depends more on their ability to charm their enemy into letting their guard down long enough to be bitten is * brilliant * . 
  the level 10 ability is not quite so great . 
  it 's good for the flavour , but mechanically 10th level warlock patron abilities are typically defensive in nature . 
  the level 10 ability * does * give that , but it also gives far too much utility . 
  simply put , it 's far too powerful . 
  essence drinker is a great ability , with one glaring flaw : humanoids are far too varied . 
  orcs , goblins , elves , dwarves , and humans are all humanoid . 
  i think that this ability should be altered such that with humanoids at least , it works based on their * subtype * . 
  creature of the night is pretty good as is . 
  also reddit , camera , what looks like some sort of podcatcher , and what looks like it might be an xkcd app ? 
  oh that 's a good idea !, 
  we should make a flute quartet using a double contrabass flute , a subcontrabass flute , and two contrabass flutes !, 
   it 's presented as an official , curated list for the entire sub, 
  that 's because that 's what it is . 
  it just originated out of sword 's personal curated list . 
  it was run by the rest of the mods first and received general approval . 
   one issue with / r/boh5e uploading everything to a doc is that dmsguild content is excluded, 
  strictly speaking , that 's an issue with the dm 's guild , not with / r/boh5e . 
  we 'd love to be able to host content from the dm 's guild , but the terms of use on that site forbid it , even with the express permission of the person who actually created it . 
  just so you know , you can edit the text of a macro before posting it on an individual basis . 
  useful for cases like this where you need to provide more clarification . 
  also useful for people 's second flair warning where you need to remind them that future unflaired submissions may be removed . 
  they all gain thematically appropriate abilities , but there 's never a sense that they are turning * into * their patron like there is with this document . 
  goolocks ' minds become too weird to read as a result of spending too much time in contact with an actual goo , for example . 
  indeed , that 's what it was . 
  specifically , it was a dam : digital asset manager . 
  it sat in the same market as adobe 's lightroom . 
  it was also basically the * only * competition lightroom had at the professional level . 
  it acts as a library for storing and organising all your photos , making basic adjustments ( with the ability to round trip to other software like photoshop if you wanted more complicated adjustments ) , and outputting photos in various forms . 
  basically a ( much ) more advanced version of the old iphoto or current apple photos app . 
  it had a ui and ux that just felt more natural to work with to me . 
  lightroom has all the same features & mdash ; it 's probably more powerful , really & mdash ; but it 's always felt very awkward to use , like they 're trying to force me into a workflow that does n't make sense . 
  unfortunately aperture saw no significant updates for a long time , and was eventually discontinued in 2014 . 
  taking lse as an example ( because as / u/crackrabbit18 says , it 's best to do your research and work out what the specific university/universities you 're interested in applying for want , but i figured it 'd be best to use a very good , but not quite oxbridge-level , university as an example ) , the standard ib offer to read law in 2016 was 38 points , with 7 , 6 , 6 at hl . 
  they also do n't seem to care which subjects you take , as long as at least two are `` traditional academic subjects '' ( i 'm guessing that means they exclude subjects like art and theatre ) . 
  they also say that it 's best if your chosen subjects demonstrate a `` high level of literacy '' . 
  i 'm guessing this means english lit or lang/lit and history would be considered more valuable than maths or physics . 
  but you could meet this requirement through your sl subjects and your ee as well , if you want , based on my reading of their page . 
   there is no ideal subject combination for law . 
  the selectors are looking for evidence of academic excellence , scholarly potential and curiosity . 
  as with all programmes at lse at least two traditional academic subjects are preferred : potential applicants are referred to the general advice on subject combinations and non-preferred subjects in the undergraduate prospectus . 
  note that law is a non-preferred subject . 
   the study of law requires a significant amount of reading , research and attention to detail , so a high level of literacy is expected and this is often evidenced by an applicant 's choice of post-16 subjects . 
  applicants offering mostly quantitative subjects at a level should demonstrate their ability to cope with these aspects of the course through their personal statement , teacher 's reference , extra-curricular activities or performance in gcse or equivalent qualifications . 
  that 's a ** major ** spoiler in the title and should not be allowed . 
  urgh , why . 
  he was literally the worst thing about season 5 . 
  and that 's saying something , considering all the ludicrous dumb new characters . 
  there are a lot of really great ones . 
  i do n't necessarily know if it 's my * favourite * per se , but the first that comes to mind as really good for me is [ rachmaninoff 's rhapsody on a theme of paganini ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvktpdg0iw0 ) . 
  the main theme itself is great , of course , and so is the famous variation 18 , but i think my favourite is variation 14 . 
  also worthy of a mention is [ beethoven 's symphony no . 
  3 `` eroica '' , 4th movement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij1xqshtqcc ) . 
  [ it turns out that the definition of `` moon '' is not a concrete as we might like . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pai1n96t8vk ), 
  yeah that 's really frustrating . 
  also frustrating is when an ad says something is `` two times more effective '' . 
  is that twice as effective ? 
  or three times more effective ? 
  ( since `` one time ** more ** effective '' would technically be twice as effective . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure they mean the former , but the latter would be more accurate . 
  so , ignoring the fact that alignments for mortals are descriptive , not prescriptive , and let 's just take the idea of a perfectly lawful evil character for a second ( because of course everyone else saying characters can and should be multidimensional and ** not ** always under every circumstance behave in a way consistent with that alignment ) . 
  lawful means , as / u/republic _ says , seeing a value in order , hierarchy , and consistency . 
  the evil part means that they desire to gain power . 
  a perfectly lawful evil character , for example , will ** never ** lie . 
  but that does n't mean they 'll tell the whole truth , either . 
  they might use weasel words and vagueries to get around the truth , or might just straight-up refuse to answer . 
  imagine most politicians when asked a difficult question . 
  you might strike a bargain or make a contract with a lawful evil character , and you can guarantee that they will live up to their side of the bargain . 
  but they 'll follow only the absolute strictest letter of the agreement , and interpret anything else in a way that most benefits themselves . 
  good bot, 
   need to screen shot things, 
  vlc has a built-in screenshot feature which is better than using the mac version , since the screenshot will be precisely at the resolution of the video itself rather than at the resolution of your screen . 
  ( i presume most other players including iina have the same feature , but the point is that this is n't a good reason to ditch vlc if one is otherwise happy with it . ), 
  for me , the simple fact that 1password does n't have a web interface makes it a complete write-off . 
  not even worth considering . 
  the fact that lastpass also comes with a specific seal of approval from security expert steve gibson ( not to say that other password vaults come with specific recommendations to avoid , but just that they have n't been looked at as closely by him ) , who i follow quite closely , is also a massive boon for me . 
  keychain does n't automatically sync to a web interface , my phone , my windows desktop , and my linux installs . 
  heck , even * just * on my mac it 's a bad choice , since it does n't autofill in my browser . 
  you ca n't `` cover '' spoilers in the titles of posts . 
  reddit mobile , reddit apps , and , most importantly , the * damn main reddit page * do n't adhere to css like that . 
  titles are not allowed , according to [ the rules of this subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cwarrow/about/rules ) , and according to common decency , to contain spoilers . 
  you really should delete this post . 
  or if you do n't , hopefully one of the mods will step in and do it instead . 
  i 'm not and never have been familiar with the `` mooroka magic mile '' , but the rows and rows of car stores are still there on gympie road between kitchener and bromilow . 
  go to concerts !, 
  obviously not a great solution for all cases , but a concert is the one place you can go where there truly is ** no ** option for distractions . 
  you ca n't get out your phone , or switch to another tab .
