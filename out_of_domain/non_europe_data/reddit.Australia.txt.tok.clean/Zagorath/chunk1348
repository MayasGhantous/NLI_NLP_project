  you do n't need some of your attention on tasks at hand . 
  and best of all , it 's the absolute greatest sound quality you can ever hear . 
  there 's something magical about live performances that even the highest quality recordings of the greatest orchestras does n't quite capture . 
  harder to select the exact piece you want to listen to . 
  and more expensive than other options . 
  but it 's a great option when it 's available to you . 
  huh . 
  everything i found on their website and forums suggested to me that it was not possible . 
  nope . 
  fancy green bar will only ever appear on the desktop web version of the site . 
  no other version of reddit supports custom css . 
  it 's not about what * they * want , it 's about what * we * want . 
  those of us i ntne community who want to avoid spoilers . 
   it doesnt help that most ~ ~ of the ~ ~ dealers ~ ~ there ~ ~ are total rogue wankers . 
  ftfy, 
  no i 'm pretty sure that was just 28 june 1971 . 
  just become a pollie and someone will do it for you . 
  fuck that 's great . 
  great playing along by the ground staff , too !, 
  in australia they usually just tear up beachballs that drop onto the field . 
  pretty sure fun is illegal at australian sporting grounds :(, 
  elon musk was born . 
  i like discussing the events of the show with other people who have watched the show . 
  i can confirm that [ neither the mobile site nor my preferred reddit app show it as covered ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0lpsx ) . 
  your bite damage seems to bee 1d8 piercing + cha necrotic . 
  the way it 's currently worded , i think you get temp hp from all of that , not just from the cha mod . 
  i do n't know if that 's the intent behind it , but it is definitely how it reads now . 
  the damage also changes to 1d8 piercing + ( 1d8 + cha ) necrotic at level 6 , and so on . 
  so after level 6 , even if the temp hp * only * comes from the necrotic damage , you can get more than your cha mod . 
  there are a number of different definitions of the edge of the solar system . 
  the one most people are familiar with , and the one this article is using , is the heliopause , which voyager 1 reached in late 2012 . 
  you do realise that heliopause literally means `` sun stop '' , right ? 
  right of conquest trumps all other rules . 
  this is all just respectful debate . 
  like malcolm promised . 
  i have not played sto , and i can not comment on the quality or lack thereof of the actual game . 
  however , i do n't find your argument very compelling . 
  that is , i do n't think your argument actually addresses your thesis . 
  should we consider star trek online when discussing what is and is not true of the star trek ( prime ) universe ? 
  from everything you wrote , it sounds like it is impeccable when it comes to maintaining continuity with alpha canon , which is the first hurdle anything has to pass to be worth considering . 
  you also seem to imply that everything in it feels authenticly star trek , and as though it is something which we can believe is in fact a realistic continuation of the trek story . 
  this , i feel , is the crux of the question . 
  whether the stories are compelling , or original , or `` worth it '' is not really , in my opinion , important to this fine institute , when it comes to addressing your initial thesis . 
  those are all important aspects to a good , high quality piece of media that it 's worth spending time and money consuming . 
  but whether it is worth considering them in discussions about the world and canon does not depend on the subjective quality of the material . 
  whether it actually is or is not worthy of consideration , i can not say . 
  but i * can * say that based solely on the arguments that you have presented , i do not think you have reached the right conclusion . 
  it kinda depends on why you got a 3 . 
  if it 's because you did n't work hard enough , then working hard and retaking maths , or entering uni through a different degree and changing , might be viable options . 
  same is true if the reason is that you had an unusually bad day on the exam , or possibly if you had a particularly bad teacher . 
  if you worked hard at maths and just were not able to get higher than a 3 , then you 're screwed . 
  business/finance/economics are courses that require a certain level of mathematical competency which you simply do not seem to possess . 
  i read [ this article ] ( http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/02/23/p.c.-culture-vs.-the-big-joke ) recently , and it was honestly the most fascinating long-form thing i 've read in a very long time . 
  it does n't explain their * methods * , but their * reasons * . 
  basically , you ca n't reason them into not being fascists , because they are n't there through reason . 
  they 're like the joker , especially in the nolan incarnation , they just want to cause harm . 
  my preferred method is, 
  why_notboth ( ), 
  do_somestuff ( ) ;, 
   they are n't on any keyboards i 've ever seen, 
  every half-decent mobile keyboard has them on long-press on the hyphen-minus button . 
  on macos they can be reached by option + - or option + shift + - , for en and em dashes respectively . 
  nice and intuitive . 
  edit : the below is included more for interest 's sake than as part of an actual * point * . 
  more difficult on windows , but is theoretically possible using the alt codes 0150 and 0151 respectively . 
  not very intuitive , but as long as you 're only aiming to remember a handful of the most commonly used unorthodox characters , it 's possible to do . 
  for some reason i have n't been able to work out , alt codes are n't working on my desktop though , so ymmv . 
  on reddit html entities ` & ndash ; ` and ` & mdash ; ` are pretty easy to remember and use . 
  latex has ` -- ` and ` -- ` . 
  but these obviously are dependent on the context in which you 're using them . 
  ( as a side note , also easy to access through mac 's option keys are accents -- for writing in other languages/loanwords , or even just writing fantasy -- and useful symbols like \u2122 , \u00ae , \u00a9 , \u00b0 , \u00b5 , ... , \u2260 , \u00b1 , many of which are also available either directly or through a long press on many mobile keyboards . ), 
  title case is a different thing with a different context . 
   programming prof enforces camel case , database prof wants underscores, 
  this is how it should be . 
  camel case for database and database field names is an abomination and anyone who uses it should be executed . 
  but camel case for method and variable names is fine . 
  i was taught to do the exact opposite of that when programming in c. 
  in java i was taught always camelcase . 
  in python , javascript , php , and matlab i was either never taught any particular style , or i 've forgotten what it was . 
  / r/boh5e has a bunch of the best homebrew stuff available , with detailed reviews explaining precisely why they are as good as they are . 
  for a much wider net , / r/unearthedarcana 's [ new `` master list '' ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 6uj8op/the _ master_list / ) has a big list of great content from the homebrew community , albeit without specific explanations of why it 's good , or what flaws it may have . 
  just that it was generally well-received by the community , and that the mods of the subreddit all agreed it deserved inclusion . 
  but then your closing brace does n't line up with your opening text !, 
   temporary hit points are intended to be cha at the beginning and then increase with the necrotic damage, 
  in that case , i would change it to, 
   gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt . 
  it 's from justice league/justice league unlimited , a show that 's part of the dc animated universe . 
  it 's a very good show and i would * highly * recommend watching it . 
  also in the same universe are batman : the animated series , and superman : the animated series , both of which ( especially the former ) are widely regarded as ** the definitive ** versions of their lead characters , outside of comics . 
  also if i may , another recommendation , though it 's * not * part of the same shared universe , is young justice . 
  an absolutely brilliant show which had 2 full seasons before being cancelled , but has just recently been announced will be getting a third season soon . 
   kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey totally did not influence my choice, 
  to be fair , the opening of also sprach ( which is presumably the bit of it you intended ) is literally called `` sunrise '' . 
  i 'd play holst 's * neptune * during the eclipse . 
  unfortunately this is a fairly brief eclipse , so you wo n't be able to go through the whole thing . 
  then , when totality ends , put on [ sunrise , from richard strauss 's also sprach zarathustra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmunxylxts ) . 
  and kneecap . 
   that really tall dark weird building across the river is not great, 
  you disparaging barad-d\u00fbr , mate, 
  edit : or , as the politicians are more likely to call it , lugb\u00farz .
