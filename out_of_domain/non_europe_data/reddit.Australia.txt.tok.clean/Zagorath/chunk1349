   just cause some cunt went full logan in logan, 
  yup . 
  ** never ** go full logan . 
  that 's actually not what the immaculate conception refers to . 
  immaculate conception is the idea that mary herself was born without sin . 
  although fun fact , the old greek word for `` virgin '' was the same as `` young woman '' . 
  i like to believe the whole `` virgin birth '' thing came about purely because some moron mistranslated it . 
   for over 100 years , there has been a common misconception that people watch professional sports for the athletes . 
   this subreddit was created to honor the underappreciated true stars of sports : the referees . 
  fuck me that is hilarious . 
  very impressive , but, 
   ** sly . 
  ** this means either something has to be going wrong in the gif , or the subject of the gif appears to be doing one thing but instead does another . 
  not even close to being sly . 
  so it looks like we do n't really know anything about it yet ? 
  the trailer shows stuff all the way from the ancient era ( like aoe 1 ) through to the colonial era ( like aoe 3 ) . 
  is this an indication that the new game will be that whole time span ? 
  or is it saying `` this is what happened before , now we pick up from here '' , indicating a victorian/edwardian era game ?

   1800s segueing into 1900s, 
  that 's kinda what i 'm hoping for . 
  something that ranges from the start of the scramble for africa , and goes up until the end of the first world war . 
  it would make a lot of thematic sense as well , since the empire building particularly in africa is a not insignificant part of the political situation that lead to the war . 
  i do n't think it would be an easy game to develop . 
  i ** know ** i would trust the old es team to do such a game and make it good . 
  i 'm pretty sure i would * not * trust whoever was responsible for the age of mythology chinese expansion to make it good . 
  but with the current dev team ? 
  i really do n't know . 
  i 'd love another game set there . 
  but not one called age of empires iv . 
  the `` age of empires # '' series should keep on moving forward in time , imo . 
  make it a reboot or a spinoff ( like aom ) and another ancient game would be * awesome * . 
  i 'm hoping it also means age 2 will get proper build queues , better pathfinding , and aside from nicer * looking * graphics , more * functional * ones as well -- ones that do n't block the stuff immediately behind them . 
  i 'd guess not until q1 next year . 
  the age 1 de is more than just graphics . 
  it 's gameplay fixes which make the game more playable in the modern world . 
  for age 2 i 'd hope that means improvements to pathfinding , and build queues that work like in age 3 and aom . 
  i 'm sure there are other fixes that it would benefit from that i ca n't remember right now . 
  oh god i fucking hated the latest season of arrow for that . 
  all these new characters with no fucking experience and dumb arse personalities/gimmicks are thrown at us and we 're supposed to just accept that they 're a part of the team now and on nearly equal ground with oliver . 
  and a main villain who is literally just the kid of some guy oliver killed in season 1 , we 're supposed to just accept that he 's a legitimate threat because they play weird techno soinds whenever he 's on screen . 
  everyone was saying the show was `` back to form '' in the latest season after the two previous seasons were weak . 
  but i thought it was just as bad as them , if not worse . 
  i do n't think we have an exact timeline on how long she was there . 
  the best track of time i know of is that from when sam let bran north of the wall ( i think that was the end of season 3 ? ), 
  until now was `` a few years '' . 
  so if we say that 's between 3 and , say 7 years , and that arya 's season 4 adventures were 1 year , then she 's been training between 2 and 6 years . 
  but that 's a lot of assumptions . 
  so the conclusion is n't very useful . 
   we dont need an entire episode of jon and co. sitting on a rock going through multiple day/night cycles before dany comes to help . 
  they used a day/night cycle to show you that they had been there awhile ; no need in wasting more time than that, 
  in some of the * other * cases where time skips happened , this might have been a valid excuse . 
  but not this time . 
  this time , there are two options . 
  gendry got back to the wall , a raven was sent to dragonstone , dany received the raven , and flew up north of the wall all in the span of at most one day . 
  the above happened , but over a much longer time period . 
  the party was just sitting there for multiple days before sandor tried his rock thing . 
  the wights and the others literally just stood around doing nothing for * multiple days * without trying something . 
  neither case is believable in the least . 
  the writers wrote themselves into a massive corner this episode . 
  and there is ** no ** excuse for that . 
  it was n't a problem that went back to an episode multiple seasons ago . 
  it was n't even really a problem set up in the * previous * episode . 
  they created a problem entirely from scratch in this episode , which forces us into one of two completely suspension-of-disbelief breaking options , all within the span of an hour of television . 
  they definitely did show us that at least one night passed . 
  unfortunately that 's not a sufficient explanation for the situation the heroes found themselves in this episode ( see my comment in reply to the same user for detailed arguments ) . 
  but they did at least show that * some * time had passed . 
  so this is just including features that currently are in the mod toolbox as part of the standard reddit interface ? 
  sounds cool . 
  edit : just realised this looks sarcastic . 
  it 's not meant to be . 
  i 'm genuinely really glad about this . 
   age of kings, 
  that 's the name of the * original * game , not its expansion . 
  the original expansion was the conquerors . 
  which is what makes it so sad to me that while they announced age 2 and age 3 definitive editions , age of mythology received absolutely no mention . 
  wait , they made a second half life game ? 
  age 2 is by far the more popular one . 
  this is without a doubt . 
  personally though , i think age 3 is a much , much better game . 
  i do n't think age 2 has ... aged ... very well at all . 
  the graphics have aged extremely poorly . 
  pathfinding is n't great . 
  and there are weird clunky mechanics like not being able to properly queue build orders . 
  the campaign is a bloody pain , because you 're constantly having to mollycoddle your heroes since them falling means you have to start the whole bloody thing again . 
  it 's also got a lot less in the way of voice acting and animation than the later games do . 
  if you 're interested in japanese or chinese games , both age 2 and 3 have options to play as these . 
  but age 2 civs a really quite homogenous . 
  you get a couple of unique units you can build , but for the most part it 's all the same just with a few different tech tree limits . 
  in age 3 every civ feels completely unique , which makes them much more compelling . 
  if you play as china or japan , your gameplay experience is noticeably ** very ** different from , say , france or the ottomans . 
  i think most of the reason people prefer age 2 is ( a ) nostalgia , and ( b ) not liking things that are different than they 're used to . 
  because i honestly can not see what there is to prefer about the earlier game , except that it 's got a medieval skin versus the colonial one . 
  in my opinion , the order of best to worst goes age of mythology , age 3 , age 2 , age 1 . 
  have you played age of empires 1 any time recently ? 
  it 's aged ** extremely ** poorly . 
  i can basically guarantee it will not be on mac .
