  they 've officially announced that age 1 de will be a windows 10 exclusive . 
  from that , considering age 2 was released for classic macos , it 's obvious that age 2 de will also be at the very least a windows exclusive , probably windows 10 . 
  age 3 de ** could ** be made available to mac , but i doubt they will . 
  part of the reason they 're pushing these new age releases is to help prop up the windows store . 
  that 's why they 're not even available on steam , or on other versions of windows . 
  would n't make sense , with that as the goal , to also release on mac . 
  it 's a shame , because i 'd love to be able to play on my laptop without rebooting into bootcamp . 
  but it is not to be , i think . 
   we put a random 30-something male 's photo in my son 's birthday card, 
  dude that 's bloody weird .

  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  the correct response , by convention , to a successful vote of no confidence in a government is the resignation of that government , and for the gg to invite another party to form government , or for the gg to dissolve the house of representatives . 
  a motion of no confidence against the prime minister , while not technically the same as a motion of no confidence in the government , carries the same convention . 
  that the ministry should resign , or the pm should advice a dissolution . 
  when no confidence in prime minister fraser was moved , the terms of the motion also instructed the speaker ( gordon scholes ) to advise governor general john kerr to call whitlam to form government . 
  although the motion passed , kerr obviously did not do this , and instead dissolved the house . 
  the whole thing went grossly against convention . 
  in addition to direct motions of no confidence or censure , a government can be shown to have lost the confidence of the house by having a `` defeat on an issue central to government policy ... the acceptance of which the government has declared to be of vital importance . '', 
  usually , if this happened , a government would , rather than immediately resigning , seek a direct vote of confidence . 
  as for the matter of loss of supply , the convention is that if supply is lost , a government should indeed resign or advise a dissolution . 
  the issue with the whitlam dismissal is that he * was * going to call an election in the senate . 
  kerr used the ( very flimsy ) grounds that whitlam was * not technically * calling for a dissolution of the house of representatives , but merely a half senate election , in order to justify dismissing whitlam . 
  it 's only 3 years older . 
  it feels more like 5 & ndash ; 8 years older , imo . 
  the 3d engine , gridless building system , improved pathfinding , and little touches like real build queues and more diverse civs all make age of mythology feel like a vastly more modern game . 
  yeah , and it was shit . 
  and with it also came shit updates to the * base * game , even if you * do n't * have the new expansion . 
  plus , age 2 has had two post-hd expansions , but was still mentioned in relation to having a definitive edition coming out . 
  oh god i thought he was the worst . 
  the weird egyptian theme felt way out of place , and his origin being connected to that nuke was so dumb . 
  but most of all , his powers made no sense . 
  seemed like he could basically do just anything . 
  it 's quite well studied that lines that are too long are harder to read . 
  the new design is quite clearly a lot better than the old one . 
  i do n't understand what it is with people on this website with complaining when sites use well-understood simple , beneficial design practices . 
  reasonable line lengths . 
  grouping stuff clearly using white space . 
  it 's inane . 
   a high enough no vote will put it off for so much longer, 
  no amount of no vote will stop labor and the greens being able to campaign on it at the next election , and enacting it if they get in to power . 
  the very fact that people like / u/lonelyaussiebear are being loud about the fact that they will not be voting , combined with the fact that by virtue of being a postal & non-compulsory vote , the turnout -- especially among younger people -- is guaranteed to be much lower * anyway * . 
  a `` no '' result is not going to be seen as carrying a legitimate mandate . 
   except deciding on cake flavours, 
  it 's rather interesting that you 'd bring that up , because one of the things that most concerns me about this postal survey is that if it does return a `` yes '' result , and the lnp does follow through with it , they 'll enact an extremely limited version of marriage equality which permits people such as bakers and florists to refuse services to same sex couples . 
  we do n't allow that sort of discrimination based on race , or age , or -- in other fields -- gender , so why should it be allowed based on sexuality ? 
  if the survey returns a `` no '' , it will not be seen as legitimate . 
  people like mr bear hear have made it clear that the survey is being boycotted at least to some degree . 
  and yet more people will not vote because it 's a postal non-compulsory survey * designed * to have a low ( especially youth ) turnout . 
  if the survey returns no , labor and the greens will still get it done after the next federal election anyway . 
  and they 'll do it properly , so that same sex couples are truely treated as equal under the law . 
  for what it 's worth i intend to vote yes . 
  but fuck you and / u/rogersterlingsfling and all the other people in this thread acting as though refusing to vote in this survey is out of `` laziness '' , and being all arrogant towards mr bear for his very well-reasoned explanations as to why he chooses not to vote in this case . 
  it is ** not ** analogous to not voting at a general election . 
  surely voluntary discounts benefit them in the short term and hurt them in the long term ? 
  it means they get more money * now * , since more people pay more of their hecs early . 
  but they get less money back overall . 
  i have n't received anything physical . 
  seen some ads on youtube for it though . 
  i 'm already enrolled . 
  though i 'm still unconvinced that it 's even going to happen . 
  the high court challenges look * very * convincing . 
   asking an employee, 
   you do n't even have to be social, 
  does not compute . 
   three words is fewer than you 'd say to the cashier if you pay by card, 
  so , i use self-checkout whenever i can , which is quite a lot . 
  when i ca n't , it 's a stock-standard `` hey '' when i first get up there , and then a `` thanks '' when i 'm leaving . 
  that 's it . 
  the rest is them scanning the things that i 've put in front of them , or them knowing i 'm paying by card because they see it in my hand . 
  no extra interaction there . 
  that sort of stock-standard conversation is easy and does n't feel like social interaction . 
  asking a question and receiving an answer does . 
  but anyway , all of this kinda misses the point . 
  the problem is knowing * what store to go to * . 
  i know i want to buy , but i do n't know what store sells it . 
  i do n't want to have to go to three or four different stores to figure it out . 
  social interaction or not , that 's a lot of time wasted . 
  these sorts of random statistics are what make listening to commentators worthwhile most of the time . 
  cricket commentators are the absolute best at it , but really you 'll find it in just about any sport . 
  the inanity is what 's so great about them !, 
  yeah , but if you 're getting a real discount for paying earlier , then the total real value paid if you pay sooner is less than the total real value if you pay the minimum . 
  good bot, 
  bad bot, 
  let 's make it our mission to get this guy into cc by year 's end !, 
  contact apple as well in case they got to him through them . 
  how many people you travelling with ? 
  century club . 
  it 's a subreddit for people with over 100,000 comment or link karma . 
  ( i was mostly joking about that part . 
  that 's n awful lot of karma to gain in a short time . ), 
   i 'd make it respond to all of them , but that would get my ip banned from reddit unless i paced it over 16 days or so , so fuck that . 
  praw , the most widely used library for interacting with reddit , does automatic rate limiting such that you do n't have to worry at all about breaking the tos .
