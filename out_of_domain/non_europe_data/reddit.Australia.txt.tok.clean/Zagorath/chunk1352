  [ google is encouraging it too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmyobeu.png ), 
  that 's why i specifically have that setting turned off on hello internet . 
   it 's also common practice to define it as r in bots that use praw, 
  since the latest major version , the praw dev has been trying to discourage this practice in the official docs . 
  but indeed , it has long been the standard practice . 
  to be fair , have you ever met a bassist ? 
  they 're pretty basic . 
   there 's some look hole that let him drive at 110 because he had a queensland licence i ca n't imagine trying to do that at 90 . 
  my research suggested that even though i was on a queensland license , i would have to follow nsw road rules while there . 
   is n't it ? 
  this looks pretty respectful to me . 
   homosexuality is a curse of death, 
  i hope you mean silicone . 
  the driver was undeniably at fault . 
  he did a u-turn when it was not safe to do so . 
  if he did n't see them because of the sun , that 's no better . 
  you ca n't turn into traffic if you ca n't see what might be coming towards you . 
  seriously wtf, 
  to be fair , i can imagine them both sounding very similar in a french accent . 
  silicon is what computer chips are made of . 
  it 's a semi metallic element on the periodic table . 
  silicone is a kinda rubbery chemical made of silicon , oxygen , and some other elements . 
  it 's most famous for being used in breast implants , but it 's also used in many other applications , including some cheap phone cases . 
  i do n't know what it 's like in britain , but all my life australia has used the short scale , and it 's been that way long enough that not even old people ever seem to acknowledge the long system ( in the way that , for example , my parents sometimes call certain restaurants by the name they used to be known as , even though they changed name a quarter of a century ago ) . 
  so the change must be pretty damn old here . 
  my cousin got married in her ( or one of her relatives ' , i 'm honestly not sure ) yard . 
  it was an absolutely lovely location , and a much nicer yard than most ( not sure if they had it done up especially or if it was normally like that ) , but i imagine it was a lot cheaper than any typical location . 
  having the ceremony and the reception in the same place was also really convenient . 
  i fucking swear they 've * designed * the roads along gympie through kedron and chermside to sync perfectly . 
  where `` perfectly '' is defined as `` so you get every single fucking light there , and never have a smooth run through '' . 
  i 've never played trl , but i 'd love to give it a go . 
  i 've played touch , and it 's heaps of fun , but the trl differences make it seem a way better game . 
  i would use kilogrammes , but i 've found my parents ' generation ( born between 1950 and 1975-ish ) use the outdated measuring system for babies , even though they 've modernised in all other respects . 
   and lessened the sense of community . 
  honestly i feel the opposite . 
  the area i grew up in has recently been changed to allow apartments to go up , where before most of the houses were lovely old queenslanders . 
  there 's much less of a sense of neighbourhood and knowing your neighbours in apartments ( especially as people are more likely to move more often ) than in traditional suburban streets . 
  oatmeal . 
  does it still boot into your os ? 
  it might be worth grabbing a copy of spinrite and seeing if you can briefly recover you files . 
  definitely not worth repairing long-term , but might he worth the small cost to see if it 's possible to get it working just long enough to get your files back . 
  if the os works , then the drive is at least good enough that this * might * be possible . 
  maybe , but by contrast corro drive , unless it 's deadlocked , i rarely find myself getting more than 1 red light along the whole way between the city and toowong . 
  it seems to me like a pretty similarly structured road , but the lights just seem to work so much better . 
  you might get better feedback about this kind of thing if you post it on [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 6tma82/the _ arcana_forge_for_all_your_drafts_ideas ) in / r/unearthedarcana . 
  it 's a subreddit dedicated to homebrew , and the arcana forge is for helping to forge material out of vague ideas like this . 
   southside, 
   corro drive, 
  edit , anyway , my point was that corro drive is really good , when compared with gympie . 
  from memory i think the promise also goes in to a little more detail of this . 
  what sort of thoughts ? 
  i thought l'appel du vide was something everyone experienced .

  i love the theme of this . 
  the flavour text is n't well-written , but it is evocative . 
  and the prerequisites are absolutely great . 
  being a prestige classes does n't exempt you from the usual spell slot rules . 
  the description of `` spells known ... '' also does n't match up . 
  according to the description you should know 6 spells at level 1 , but the table says you know 3 . 
  dark cunning is ** way ** too powerful . 
  is it meant to allow you to use intelligence * instead * ? 
  because it does n't say that right now . 
  there 's no such thing as a `` surprise round '' . 
  instead , say that it 's if `` the creature is surprised '' . 
  spell betrayal is probably okay . 
  generally unique mechanics are better than trying to just wholesale steal the mechanics from another class , and you should * try * to find something better if you can , but it 's not the end of the world if you ca n't . 
  nothing at 2nd level , in a prestige class , is very problematic . 
  prestige classes need to have a very strong theme to justify their existence , and that means that at the * very * least , you should be giving ribbons at every level . 
  charismatic armour needs some flavour text justifying how it works . 
  just `` yeah you can add charisma to ac '' does n't come close to cutting it . 
  you 've got no text explaining what happens at 4th level . 
  just putting it in the table is n't enough . 
  dark charisma is pretty great , but `` expertise '' is not a term in the game . 
  it 's a ** class feature ** of rogues and bards . 
  you ca n't just say `` you gain expertise '' in something . 
  you need to say `` your proficiency modifier is doubled '' . 
  elluvia 's curse is a fantastic , flavourful ability . 
  it should , however , state that having * remove curse * cast on them , or similar magic , will remove the ability . 
  queen 's beauty is worded absolutely awfully . 
  if you 're giving this ability , use the same language as you can see in the barbarian 's level 20 ability . 
  but i do n't think you should give it this ability , since it is one that can be gained as early as 14th level , which is far too early for such a massive bonus .
