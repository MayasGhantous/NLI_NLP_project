  putting my mod hat on for a second here , the art is gorgeous , but ** you will need to credit the artists , or the post will be removed . 
  over all , it 's got a pretty decent theme , and a few cool mechanical ideas . 
  but it is mechanically * incredibly * flawed . 
  i think it ought to be taken back to the drawing board . 
  i might suggest cutting it down to 5 levels , increasing the * minimum * level requirement to 8 , and making elluvia 's curse the level 5 ability . 
  for spellcasting , you need to make spell slots function identically to the standard ones . 
  but if you want , you can provide specific rules for preparing spells which allow you to have a class list that goes beyond the 3rd level maximum that a 5 level class ( or the 5th level maximum that a 10 level class , if you do n't heed my advice and change it ) can cast , if the character has multiclassed from another casting class , and has spell slots from combining the two which go beyond that . 
  it 's unorthodox , but i think for certain spellcasting-themed prestige classes , it 's necessary . 
  and it 's far more acceptable than using a non-standard spell slot table . 
  just so it does n't get lost in the many paragraphs of my other comment . 
  you will need to credit the artists if you do not want this removed . 
   normally prestige classes are limited to a set of classes/combos, 
  no , absolutely ** not ** . 
  this sort of thing is what ruined prestige classes in other editions , by making them essentially `` x class but better '' . 
  prestige classes in 5e are about making strongly flavourful concepts which are n't quite significant enough for a whole class , and which are rare and difficult to join . 
  but outside of some very broad restrictions ( e.g. 
  ability score , `` being able to cast spells '' , that kind of thing ) , they should not be too restricted in terms of mechanics . 
   i do n't know of any other class that allows you to boost your stat over 20 . 
  uhh ... barbarians ? 
  but that 's their capstone ability . 
  with this prestige class , the rule is being exempted as early as 14th level , which means it 's still a bad idea . 
   i think you need to reword this as `` armor class can never be lower than ... '' . 
  i think you 're right here , but for the wrong reasons . 
  it sounds like you 're not familiar with unarmoured defence , the ability that both barbarians and monks get . 
  ( for con and wis plus dex , respectively . ), 
  but you 're right that it 's worded badly . 
  this ability is not worded using the correct phrasing for an ability like that . 
   i was considering going to bump it up to needing arcane spell casting abilities so level dipping rogues could n't abuse it, 
  this would not be such a bad idea . 
  i 'd probably have it be either that you have the ability to cast at least one spell , or that you have the ability to cast a least one 3rd level spell . 
  i do n't think it 's * necessary * that you add that prerequisite , but it also would n't be a terrible idea . 
   do you think it 's reasonable to keep queen 's beauty given that a character who takes a 10th level prestige class will never attain a 17th-20th level ability ? 
  not unless you changed this somehow so that that ability could not be gained until at * least * the character 's 15th level , preferably not before 18th . 
  not sure how you would achieve that . 
   what if it was 5 levels but just granted spellcasting/pact magic progression as though a character leveled in 1 spellcasting/pact magic class they currently have, 
  that 's sorta what i was suggesting earlier . 
  basically , put in the standard 5 level spellcasting progression ( the same one you 'll see in the class entry for the rune scribe or the_singular_anyone 's vampire ) . 
  then explain that for multiclassing purposes it counts as a full caster . 
  then change the text of `` spells known of 1st level and higher '' in some way that means you 're able to know spells from this class based on the highest spell slot level you have as a character , and not exclusively the slots you 've got through this class . 
  i would make sure that you keep the spells known inherent to * this * class , and not simply allow you to treat these spells as though they came from another class , because that could get very complicated and confusing . 
  but do allow the * level * chosen to be higher . 
  the exact way in which you phrase that , i ca n't think of right now . 
   charismatic armor is just their version of an ability that monks and barbarians get at level one, 
  to be fair , this prestige class does not use the correct phrasing to make it function according to unarmoured defence . 
  but indeed , i also wonder about the other person 's understanding of wotc material . 
  it 's extremely awkward as it 's written , and it ** should ** be changed to match unarmoured defense . 
  but to be fair , it does also say `` while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield ... your ac can never be less than '' . 
  so in effect it * should * work out the same in all cases . 
  it 's like a more complicated * barkskin * with some extra prerequisites . 
  it has essentially * instantaneously * replaced irc for me . 
  being a better version of irc is , for me personally , its only real selling point . 
  i 've got a handful of friends that i regularly game with , and we use skype . 
  we tried discord , but every time we have , one or two of us have just had zero luck getting audio to work through it . 
  never had any troubles with skype . 
  so for me , discord is just a really fucking amazing chatroom for reddit communities . 
  nah , that one is better . 
  the facial expressions are important in this meme , covering that up defeats half the point . 
   this is a class you do n't plan on choosing when you make your character, 
  i do n't necessarily agree . 
  it 's a class you ca n't guarantee you 'll be able to achieve , but you absolutely can plan for it . 
  you can work with your dm to include it as a story point . 
  in fact i would say you * should * do so . 
  it 's unlikely to come up otherwise . 
  it 's much less likely to come up organically than , say , being turned into a vampire or lycanthrope . 
   now , let 's say your main attribute was already charisma . 
  your next highest attribute would then probably be wisdom or constitution, 
  huh ? 
  i would say dex is nearly always the next choice . 
  dex is kinda the master stat in general , and a plus one to not being hit is worth more than +1 hp per level , even without the saving throws , initiative , etc. 
  and i ca n't think of a single reason for a cha character to go wisdom as well . 
  for bards dex is * explicitly * recommended , for sorcerers and warlocks its merely an obvious second choice . 
  con a little behind , followed by the rest . 
  but that 's moot because as i said , you 're probably thinking ahead just in case . 
   it 's significantly weaker than the +4 charisma feature , although the level gap is considerable . 
  without a doubt . 
  but that is why my suggestion was scrap that ability entirely . 
  i am . 
  unfortunately i had some problems two and three weeks out that meant my training was n't nearly where i wanted it to be . 
  i 'm hoping that with the adrenaline/excitement bonus from the event , i 'll be able to equal my time from last year of 45 minutes . 
  10 k. you ? 
  wis certainly is more useful than int . 
  but both of them have relatively poor synergy with cha . 
  i ca n't think of any class , off the top of my head , that uses more than one of the mental stats . 
   i did n't realise there was such a demand for these, 
  yeah no kidding . 
  i threw mine out . 
  i wish i had known they were worth something !, 
  seems ridiculous to me that they 'd try to crack down on people selling them though . 
  like that peter guy on gumtree said ,, 
   these are generic vouchers with no entitlement information whatsoever to identify them specifically . 
  on what planet is it illegal to sell an asset that i own . 
  it 's not 1 , since i 'm only using a single flair class . 
  it 's * possible * that another rule is conflicting with it . 
  i do n't know exactly how the automod works behind the scenes , but i ca n't see how a sensible implementation of it would result in conflicts . 
  [ here 's the whole thing as it sits today ] ( https://pastebin.com/zbkamxdg ) . 
  here are a few posts that did n't have the flair automatically updated . 
  * / r/dndgreentext/comments / 6vc4zz/anons _ in_hacienda_de_muerte /, 
  * / r/dndgreentext/comments / 6viakh/anon _ has_a_stroke /, 
  i do n't remember the order of events on the hacienda one , but the other one was definitely flaired manually with `` short '' first , then the transcriber left the comment , and then the flair was manually altered to say `` transcribed '' . 
  the hacienda one was either flaired as `` short '' by the user , or it had no flair until a mod came along and did it * after * the transcriber left the comment .
