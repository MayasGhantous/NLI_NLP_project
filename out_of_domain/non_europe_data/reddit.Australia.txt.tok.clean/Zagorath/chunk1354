  [ here 's a screenshot verifying the user 's flair class , in case i 've somehow done that wrong . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  good bot, 
  so this is how democracy dies ... 
  great , thanks for the help . 
  trust us when we say , you 're not alone in this , america . 
  i dunno , i live in an apartment and get them occasionally . 
  it 's a little book of vouchers that say you can redeem them for waste removal or something . 
  not entirely sure of the details as i 've never used them . 
  presumably it 's stuff that needs to go to the dump , rather than being able to go in your council wheelie bin . 
  hence , `` droning on '' . 
  as you may know , on the bagpipes , there are a bunch of different pipes . 
  but only one of these plays the actual melody and has holes in it to allow the performer to change note . 
  this one is called the chanter . 
  the rest of the pipes are the drones , and play a constant humming noise , usually at one and two octaves below the root note of the chanter . 
  it 's available online to listen without region locking , and it has a fantastic balance of old classical favourites , older but more obscure works , and more modern classical music . 
  the b and d are important since they 're the non-standard notes in the chord . 
  the melody has the eb tonic , so you 're good there . 
  i 'd probably play whatever combination of notes in the chord ( eb , g , b , d ) is easiest with that in mind , and the context of whatever chords come before and after it . 
  it 's a very strange sounding piece tbh . 
  i 've got an arrangement of it that 's fully realised and there are some parts that no matter how i think about it , it still just sounds wrong . 
  though i 'm not sure the part op has shown is one of them . 
  i was gon na downvote you for being a fuckwit , then i read the last sentence , which made it obvious you were being facetious . 
  hi , just so you know , you appear to be shadowbanned . 
  this means no one will see your comments unless they are manually approved by a moderator of the subreddit . 
  it 's something that is only supposed to be applied to bots and spammers , no legitimate users should ever be shadowbanned , but in your case , that seems to be what 's happened . 
  you should go to / r/shadowban to learn more and to find out how to try and remedy the situation . 
  hi , just so you 're aware , we have a rule that requires you to delete old posts if you submit an updated version within 1 week of the initial posting . 
  i 've done it for you this time , but in the future please remember to remove old posts when submitting new ones . 
  who fucking cares about al. 
  i wish they would just design the fucking game for the game 's sake , and not restrict themselves to the whims of some arbitrary shitty little subset of the game . 
  it kinda depends on the key , i think . 
  e is certainly a less comfortable key to play in than c , but i would say something like ab is also a very comfortable key because of how the hand sits , despite two out of the three notes in the key 's major triad being black . 
  indeed . 
  even within the western classical tradition , major can be happy , heroic , or regal . 
  minor might be sad , but might also be angry , mysterious , resigned , or so many more moods . 
  and that 's entirely without getting into the associations other cultures might have . 
  russian/slavic , for example , is much the same as what you described for jewish and klezmer . 
   hans zimmer ( i 'm working through his master class on film scoring ), 
  my condolences . 
  basically all the drivers on my most common routes seem to be scabs . 
  it 's really made me think a lot less of them as a whole . 
  i was away from my normal areas on friday and surprised to find that buses were still doing the `` no fee because industrial action '' thing , since i have n't had a single free bus ride outside of that one occasion . 
  if there were fewer scabs , i 'm sure this damn thing would have been resolved already . 
  good bot, 
  why in the hells are people in an australian subreddit using the outdated measurements ? 
  by `` here '' do you mean australia in general , or this subreddit in particular ? 
  because i do n't frequent the subreddit , but i do live in the country and can confirm that if that 's what you mean , it 's not true . 
  stabbot seems pretty legit , but i 'm guessing deepfrybot gets ranked so highly thanks to shitposters . 
  looks like it mostly posts in shitposting subreddits . 
  [ here 's my realised version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mhqtlir.jpg ) . 
  not quite the same chords . 
  it starts more with an eb # 5add6 , then dadd6 , dbadd6 , then back to the d . this part actually sounds really nice as it 's realised in this version . 
  maybe it 's a regional thing ? 
  where you from ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard the outdated units used in queensland . 
  nope . 
  this is what the hand wave is for . 
  i give a slightly different hand wave for `` thanks '' or `` sorry '' , but either way , the hand wave is a clearly visible communication to the other driver that i 'm acknowledging what just happened .

   never gets more than 45 people at peak peak times , normally maxes out around 30ish, 
  that 's dead ? 
  i would ** love ** for that to be the case on diameter :(, 
  hello fellow human . 
  this unit is not a robot . 
  not sure where you got that idea . 
  until recently companies were selling digital goods in australia and paying nothing . 
  just recently a law was passed requiring them to pay the same gst as any local company , which is 10 % . 
  they * are * charging people . 
  that 's how i know they 're not involved . 
  i did n't see a single 412 or 402 that did n't charge . 
  that 's kind of my point .
