  we literally know nothing about it so far . 
  jon will be vi , wo n't he ? 
  they do n't count if they die before they can take the throne . 
  i do n't know exactly how the timelines match up . 
  i just assumed lyana gave birth after the other aegon had died . 
  still weird . 
  but slightly less weird than if the two half brothers shared a name while both being alive . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are some people in the * cast * who do n't know that . 
  yeah i 'm wondering the same thing tbh . 
   the a above middle c is around 440 hertz . 
  musically , yes . 
  the a above middle c is usually * precisely * 440 hz ( though some orchestras , especially period ones , tune differently ) . 
  but scientists use a slightly different scale . 
  c is a power of 2 , with middle c at 256 hz . 
  no that 's c. scientists are case sensitive . 
   suncorp announced they 'd be supporting nfc, 
  wait , suncorp has announced they 're gon na support nfc ? 
  source ? 
  do they mean android/apple pay , or some stupid system of their own ? 
  * accidentally forgot to top up gocard, 
  that 's the one time i bought a paper ticket in the last half decade . 
  if most people are already speeding , then they need to put police or cameras on that road to stop speeding . 
  it 's illegal and dangerous . 
  i 'm not talking at the bottom of a hill or something , that 's a bit unfair . 
  but if a whole major road has most people breaking the law , that 's a good opportunity to both improve safety and make a bit more money . 
  torvalds ? 
  does n't look anything like him to me ... 
   i do n't expect churches to perform same sex marriages if they do n't want to, 
  i agree with you on this . 
  the question then becomes other marriage-related services . 
  cake makers , florists , caterers , etc. 
  do you think these services should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of the sex of the people being married ? 
  i know i do n't think it should be allowed . 
  and i worry very much that if the lnp is the party to table marriage equality legislation , they will allow this sort of discrimination , but because it 's now been done , labor wo n't be able to campaign on the issue and get a proper , equitable marriage equality legislation through after the next election . 
  if the survey ( a ) is allowed to go ahead ( i 'm still holding out hope that the high court will say fuck that noise ) , and ( b ) returns a `` yes '' vote , the end result could be worse than if we just waited until after the next election and let labor do it properly . 
  it 's still falling to 10 or lower 6 times in the next 10 days . 
  i would n't be saying so long to winter * quite * yet . 
   that 's like , web design 101, 
  i do n't know which part specifically you 're looking at , but actually , design 101 is `` whitespace is a useful thing '' . 
  i know people on reddit like to deny it , but frankly most people do n't have a fucking clue what they 're talking about . 
  blank space is * critical * for users scanning the page to find information that is grouped together . 
  it is an extremely well-known phenomenon that information which is too densely packed on a page actually * increases * the amount of time it takes to get the relevant information out . 
  i 'm astonished at how much negativity this new design is attracting . 
  i love it !, 
  * dark mode, 
  * much larger videos on the watch page, 
  * adding videos to your `` watch later '' playlist no longer makes the button to go to your watch later playlist unpressable for a few seconds . 
  dark mode * alone * would be enough reason for me to say this is a massive improvement . 
  the other stuff is just some nice flavour on top . 
  it 's not perfect though . 
  * ca n't edit watch later playlist without getting shunted back into the old ui . 
  * numbers in many locations are no longer precise : you get told a video has 2k likes ( never mind that the correct abbreviation for 1000 is `` k '' , not `` k '' ) and a channel has 1.7 m subscribers . 
  and even when hovering over this information , you do n't get a precise number . 
  * scrolling in the playlist box on a watch page does n't confine scrolling only to that playlist . 
  if you 're at the bottom of the playlist , scrolling down * should * do nothing . 
  instead , it scrolls down the rest of the page . 
  i 've repeatedly submitted feedback on these issues , and i hope others will as well . 
  but the overall design of the new look , i think is still really good . 
   you also need 2 clicks now to get to the subscriptions . 
  before the update , it was on your homescreen, 
  your subscriptions have n't been on the home page for * years * , unfortunately . 
  but in terms of getting to the / feed/subscriptions page , it 's currently just as easy as it was in the most recent old look . 
  you click the button in the bar at the side which says `` subscriptions '' . 
  this is one of the things i hate about the new design . 
  but it feels more like an oversight/lazy design than a finalised concept . 
  like they wanted to get out a mvp first , and then iterate on that . 
  make sure to use the `` send feedback '' button to tell them to fix this shit . 
  maybe he was n't used to the instrument ? 
  still , while i 'm not a brass player , my understanding is that it 's generally pretty easy to switch between different instruments , especially closely related ones like trumpet , bugle , heraldic trumpet , etc. 
  so i 'm not sure how viable the above excuse could be . 
  yeah , they removed them from the top . 
  but they 're still in the sidebar , just like they were before . 
  it 's just that they used to be unnecessarily duplicated for some reason . 
  yeah , i ignored what you wrote . 
  because it 's fucking dumb . 
  people who are willingly breaking the law * are willingly choosing to do something illegal * . 
  that 's on * them * , and nobody else . 
  the sidebar shows up on my laptop , which has a screen resolution of 1440 across . 
  so it 's definitely less than that . 
  from my experimentation , it seems to be that a viewport of about 1280 across that 's the minimum before the sidebar is hidden . 
  that 's small enough that even most laptops are going to have the sidebar available . 
  [ no , it 's not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:a440.png ), 
  a440 ** is ** a4 . 
  although a4 can also have other pitches , such as 444 common in europe , or 415 for baroque period informed performances . 
  c4 is middle c , but somewhat counter-intuitively , the note one semitone below that is in fact b3 . 
  to save you the click , this is talking about ** both ** the marriage equality survey being ruled a misuse of funds * and * the mps who are foreign citizens being ruled ineligible . 
  on a similar note , you can do the inverse of speed : pace . 
  you usually measure the speed of cars and bikes in kilometres per hour , or sometimes metres per second . 
  but runners measure their * pace * , their minutes per kilometre . 
  if you wanted to ( do n't know why you would , but you * could * ) , you could measure the speed that you drive in min/km , or sec/km . 
  to pick a more obscure unit of time , you could do * furlongs per jiffy * , so that both the distance and the time are ones that most people will be unfamiliar with . 
  [ i like how the link is still live on the website ] ( http://www.cgpgrey.com/recommended-listening/ ) , but now it just recommends you listen to the backlog of hello internet . 
  too bloody bad for them . 
  i like to describe earth 's diameter as 413 picoparsecs . 
  ireland is a part of the british isles . 
  it 's a geographic term , not a political one . 
  it does n't matter if they like it or not . 
  with a username like that , i have to assume you 're an aussie cricket fan trolling us . 
  yeah no kidding . 
  i had a friend who was mostly a percussionist ( which , as the jokes go , is merely `` a friend of a musician '' ) , but picked up a bit of trumpet in her last year of high school .
