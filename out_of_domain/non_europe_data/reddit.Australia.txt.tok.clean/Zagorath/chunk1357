  pretty damn sure she was better than this by the end of it . 
  but ... it 's not even the largest state of the united states of america ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_clarke_ ( cricketer ), 
  i 've taken both web design courses and , more importantly , human computer interaction courses . 
  ( web design has the unfortunate tendency to sometimes focus too much on * trends * , and less on what is objectively superior . 
  hci does not suffer from this problem . ), 
  it 's not a huge surprise that so many people on this site seem to disagree with the reality . 
  after all , reddit is the * epitome * of bad design , so it 's not a huge surprise if people who have learnt to enjoy using this site might be happy to dismiss * actual * bad design and ask for better designs to be made worse . 
  as for youtube right now , i ca n't think of any substantial way in which it has too much white space . 
  looking at my subscriptions feed ( in list view ) , maybe they could reduce a little of the vertical white space . 
  but at least on my screen , there is n't enough room to get any more videos on the screen at once without reducing the thumbnail size substantially . 
  and in list view , there 's not enough room for a second column , since you want room for some of the video description . 
  on a screen larger than mine , there * might * be room for a second column , but then you run into difficulties with parsing two columns of information-dense content at once . 
  switching to grid view gives you a much higher density of videos per screen & mdash ; on my screen , 5 columns and three rows , without the need to scroll . 
  on larger screens there would be * room * to put more columns in , but again , after a certain limit , more columns increases cognitive load too much , and keeping width limited becomes more useful . 
  the vertical white space , just like in list view , would n't allow for more videos to appear on screen at once even if they did decrease it . 
  and unlike list view , i ca n't even see any of the vertical space on this screen which is even potentially being wasted . 
  on the watch page , they 've changed to make the video larger & mdash ; to take up the entire width of the screen . 
  the video is the main reason people are there . 
  keeping other information from cluttering up the screen is quite * obviously * a good thing there . 
  perhaps if you could explain exactly which aspects of the new ui you think have too much white space , it would be easier for this conversation to go somewhere productive . 
  it 's not as big as soccer , sure , but when the sport that this conversation is really comparing it too is ice hockey & mdash ; not even the most popular type of * hockey * & mdash ; there 's no doubt that cricket is bigger . 
  popular throughout the entire british commonwealth except for canada , including countries as culturally diverse as zimbabwe , india , and australia, 
  if it were n't for the fact that it turns out he was a cheat , i reckon lance armstrong might have been a contender for the title of most dominating in a sport . 
  this is making me wonder ... just how noisy * is * a set of armour ? 
  the hema and historical armour/weapons people frequently pop up to point out that wearing armour does n't weigh you down as much as many games imply , but i do n't think i 've ever seen them say anything one way or the other about stealth . 
   is n't that half of the time ? 
  50 is a very high score for a batter to get in a single innings . 
  your career average is the mean of all the scores you got in every innings you played . 
  according to my rough reading of [ this diagram ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/cricketbattingaveragehistogram.png ) the median career batting average ( i.e. , the amount that half of people get above ) seems to be around 25 & ndash ; 30 . 
  only a tiny amount of people seem to have career averages above 50 . 
  50 % accuracy of what , exactly ? 
  it does n't really even seem to make sense as a question . 
  not a great idea . 
  aside from the fact that it takes more effort on matt 's part , it 's also a misuse of the distinguish button , which is for making it clear when a mod is acting in their capacity as a subreddit moderator & mdash ; enforcing subreddit rules and the like . 
  mine 's bright yellow , and just reminds me that it 's `` matt colville '' . 
  i mostly use red for marking arseholes . 
  oh , right . 
  that would be a * terrible * performance . 
  even if you score zero runs off a ball , it 's often better to block than to just let it go through to the keeper . 
  awesome !, 
  thanks for chiming in !, 
  edit re undergarments : yeah i 've always just assumed people wear the standard stuff under their armour . 
  chainmail wearers have a gambeson , plate armour wearers have a gambeson plus chain , etc. 
  but the game 's descriptive text could do a better job of describing that . 
  i ca n't be the only one who thought that what they were saying regarding teslas was completely clear the first time around , can i ? 
  i honestly put the blame squarely on people 's reading ( listening ? ), 
  comprehension there . 
  you ca n't be much clearer than saying, 
   drive your current car as long as possible ... but ... if you absolutely need a new one , then go ahead and buy yourself a nice small electric car, 
  if people did n't understand that entirely clear statement , that 's * their * fault , not the presentation 's . 
  well it 's no wonder they get salty . 
  you 're a pom that does n't like cricket ? 
  that 's fucking sick . 
  next you 'll be telling me you do n't care for tea . 
  sick in the bad way . 
  not the `` cool '' way . 
  it syncs all my stuff really nicely between different computers and my phone . 
  it 's ** far ** better than firefox on android & mdash ; or at least , it was back in 2014 when i last tried giving firefox a go , and it was utter shite on mobile . 
  there are also a few other less important but still worth mentioning factors . 
  the security and stability improvements of its sandbox model . 
  the more forward-looking attitude towards things like security certificates . 
  the fact that there are a few websites which fail to work properly in firefox ( most notably the homebrewery ) . 
  i only mention firefox , because it 's the only viable alternative . 
  i use windows , mac , linux , and android devices . 
  so safari and edge are both options on * some * devices , but not all . 
  chrome , firefox , and opera are the only significant players out there available on all my devices . 
  ah , you mean literal white space . 
  i use the new dark mode . 
  in fact , the fact that they 've created a dark mode is the reason i opted in to the new interface a couple of weeks ago . 
  as for the search page , what else would you suggest they put there ? 
  there is n't quite enough room for two columns in your screenshot ( and not even close to two columns on my screens ) , and even if you squeezed things up to make room , then you 've introduced the extra cognitive load on users by having to scan across two separate axes . 
  brin , is that you ? 
  if you 're interested in tieflings , i would ** highly ** recommend to you the brimstone angels series , by erin m. evans . 
  they contain a heap of great lore about tieflings and the nine hells . 
  your penultimate paragraph especially makes me think you 'll like them . 
  there 's the conflict between the over-arching racial story and the deeply personal experiences of an individual . 
  i first read evans ' books because i was playing a warlock and wanted to do some background research . 
  i was playing a human at the time , but evans completely convinced me that tieflings are an incredible race with some amazing potential for great narrative . 
   maybe you have the `` cinema mode '' activated, 
  well , yes , of course . 
  who would n't ? 
  and cinema mode now extends much wider than before . 
   the top bar ( containing the search field ) now gets dark in cinema mode . 
  but nothing else does, 
  the whole interface does !, 
  all the time !, 
  because the biggest selling point of this new interface for me ( as i opted in weeks ago ) is the inclusion of a dark mode . 
   the navbar not being always visible is a big gripe with the interface i have, 
  why would n't you want the actual video to be the highlight on the watch page ? 
  the entire point of that page is to watch the video , and so it should come as big as possible and with as few distractions as possible . 
   the 4 main areas ( top nav , left nav , main video area , suggestions ) are no longer visibly divided . 
  it 's all white now . 
  even disregarding your edit , i do n't see how you get this . 
  based on your screenshot , opening left nav makes the rest of the page significantly darker and top nav has drop shadow . 
   navbar is only modal on the video page, 
  it makes sense if you consider the use case . 
  on the watch page you are watching the video . 
  you 've got access to the extra stuff if you need it , but the normal behaviour is watch a video until you 're done with it , then leave . 
  you do n't * need * to access both controls on the watch page and from the sidebar at the same time .
