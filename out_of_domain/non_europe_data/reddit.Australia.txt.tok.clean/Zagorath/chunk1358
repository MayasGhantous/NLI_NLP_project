   https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending went from 2 colums to 1 colum, 
  people use the trending page ? 
  i 'm looking at it now and i do n't think there 's a single video worth watching . 
  some boring pop music videos , a hate-mongering anti-marriage equality ad , and a few other lowest-common-denominator type things . 
  anyway , the 2 columns thing i 've addressed elsewhere . 
  with thumbnails , titles , and descriptions , having two columns becomes too much information to reasonably parse . 
  and when most screens are n't going to be wide enough to display 2 * anyway * , it makes more sense to provide a consistent user experience than to have it sometimes grow to a second column if the screen is especially large . 
   the previous arrangement of infos ( author infos left , view numbers and rating to the right ) is used on basically every video site . 
  and now they change that ? 
  huh , i did n't even notice until you pointed it out . 
  but now that you have , i have to admit , i 'm not a fan . 
  the change definitely makes things less easy to find . 
  i 've been more focussed on the rather annoying change from precise numbers of likes and subscribers ( the latter previously available on hover ) to just showing `` 5k '' , with no additional detail possible . 
  that infuriates me , doubly so because the abbreviation for 1000 is `` k '' , not `` k '' . 
  good bot, 
  it might be worth allowing initiative to be player 's choice of dex , wis , or int . 
  you can use strength saves more often through things like rushes of water down a hallway , or creatures like wolves with special effects that force it . 
  or int saves by going up against far realm creatures . 
  give opportunities where grappling is a great option , such as an enemy that 's trying to run away that they * really * do n't want to let get away . 
  or opportunities for investigation rolls . 
  i do think that dex is too powerful , but i think the best way to counter it is not by nerfing it , but by finding ways to buff everything else , especially strength and int , which in my experience both suffer from being bad saving throws and the most rarely used skill checks . 
   can you show on the / about/moderators page a list of who has 2fa enabled ? 
  but make sure this is visible only to other mods !, 
  for obvious reasons . 
   when i activate cinema mode on a video , anything below the video is still white, 
  yeah , because you have n't enabled dark mode , which is what that whole paragraph was about . 
   the navbar on the video page is clearly divided from the rest . 
  but on the front page it 's not . 
  since you did n't screenshot it , i do n't know what it looks like in white mode . 
  but in dark mode the differentiation is pretty substantial . 
  navbar is a comparatively light 28 , 28 , 28 , compared to the main window 's 17 , 17 , 17 . 
  combined with the fact that it does n't move as you scroll , and is physically separated by being way off to the left , [ it 's pretty easy to parse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpfzdri.png ), 
   but a list changing from 3 to 2 to 1 column is n't hard, 
  for sure , not hard . 
  but i do think that it 's an incredibly poor behaviour in websites that should be used only in very carefully considered ways that greatly enhance user experience . 
  when there are * already * arguable major drawbacks to using multiple columns ( such as is the case here ) , it 's best to just ... not . 
   and that to rather small button with a 36x28px size, 
  yeah , that 's definitely a problem . 
  the button is way harder to hit than it should be . 
  not sure why they do n't * at least * extend the target all the way to the left and top edges of the viewport . 
  yeah without a doubt this event is completely the cyclist 's fault , and no other action can have excused what he did . 
  but there 's also no doubt in my mind that the bus driver must have done * something * wrong for the cyclist to have felt this was an appropriate response . 
  people do n't go miles out of their way to assault random innocents . 
   you threw dark mode into the mix, 
  indeed i did . 
  it was a not-so-subtle hint that , as you say :, 
   dark mode looks much nicer than the white counterpart, 
  because the above sentence is nearly universally true , but is especially so on a site dedicated to watching video . 
  well , it 's actually a photo of most of her torso up to her head . 
  it 's just a rather ... unfortunate choice of thumbnail . 
  no , the cyclist is definitely at fault . 
  of the driver did something inconsiderate or dangerous , the only correct response would have been to report it . 
  it does n't matter what he did , assault is not okay . 
  but he * did n't * visit america . 
  he never even visited the entire continent of north america , let alone the country of the united states of america ( or rather , the area now known as that ) . 
  i put the backlash down to the fact that people do frequently just suck at understanding things on the internet . 
  it 's a shitty blanket rule either way . 
  there are a lot of really useful box out there that make reddit experience better for everyone . 
  literally the interface just previous to this was perfect . 
  subreddit rules on their own , available in one click . 
  drop down menu for reddit rules , with the only common one , spam , selected by default . 
  it was so obvious just from theoretically thinking about the new interface that this would become a problem . 
  the weeks since the update have only served to demonstrate that we were right for saying this would reduce the utility of reports . 
  yeah it does n't matter if he put you or your daughter in danger . 
  responding with violence is never an acceptable way to go about things . 
  this is n't an `` agree to disagree '' issue . 
  it 's the law , and it 's the basic foundation of society . 
  it 's not the heat of the moment if you have to follow them for minutes until they get out ... 
  what ? 
  at no point did i respond to a comment about anything other than following a guy for a few minutes until he gets out . 
  lol wtf are you on about . 
  one of his major corrections in this episode was that some people thought he emphasised the carbon emotions in production of electric cars ** too much ** . 
  i ca n't be the only one who thought that what they were saying regarding teslas was completely clear the first time around , can i ? 
  i honestly put the blame squarely on people 's reading ( listening ? ), 
  comprehension there . 
  you ca n't be much clearer than saying, 
   drive your current car as long as possible ... but ... if you absolutely need a new one , then go ahead and buy yourself a nice small electric car, 
  if people did n't understand that entirely clear statement , that 's * their * fault , not the presentation 's . 
  assuming by ev , you mean electric vehicle , go back and rewatch the original episode . 
  and actually listen to the words that are said , not some strawman you think he 's talking about . 
  he does indeed correct himself in this episode , but i do n't think he should have .

  he 's a reporter , not an anchor . 
  the anchors are the ones sitting in studio , because they `` anchor '' the programming . 
  annoyingly , where i live , there 's frequently a campaign to * introduce * dst . 
  the southern states have it , and my state thankfully does n't , but a lot of people in the south east of queensland want to introduce it to be more like them . 
  never mind that it literally kills people , even aside from the economic costs and lack of ** any ** advantages . 
  we want to be more like the other states !, 
  it 's a rare case where i can actually say thank fuck for the people from the north and west of queensland . 
  this joke only works in new zealand . 
   each time a player is kicked for afk , the player receives a system report that counts towards a community ban ( 8 reports ) . 
  how long do these reports last for ? 
  i 've received quite a few over time , but never in a short time span . 
  i do n't think i 've ever been banned because of it ...
