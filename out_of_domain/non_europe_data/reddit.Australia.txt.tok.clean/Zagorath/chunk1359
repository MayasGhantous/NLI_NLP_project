   if two tieflings always breed true, 
  in fact , with the phb type tieflings , just ** one ** tiefling parent will always result in a tiefling child . 
  the variant tieflings do n't necessarily have this property , and their blood can dilute over time . 
  to quote from brimstone angels : lesser evils :, 
   the children born to tieflings after that rite were devil-born . 
  the true-breeding scions of asmodeus . 
  a hundred years ago , a body might have a little devil blood , and mixing with the right mortals would thin it out . 
  mortals do n't breed straight down , after all . 
  not even with fiendish blood in them . 
  now a dozen generations could go by , but the result will be the same . 
   mortals do n't breed straight down -- but tieflings , ah tieflings were the exception . 
  tieflings did n't mix , did n't dilute . 
  a human and an elf might beget a half-elf , but no matter who laid down with a tiefling -- human , elf , orc -- the result was another tiefling . 
  `` that rite '' refers to the ritual which the toril thirteen engaged in , which resulted in the apotheosis of asmodeus , as well as all tieflings in existence ( at that time ) being turned into the type of tiefling we see in the player 's handbooks of 4th and 5th editions . 
  it was announced weeks ago . 
  the question is why it would be trending * today * . 
  yeah that 's the big problem with it for me . 
  i 'm a casual player and enjoy bouncing around different civs . 
  but aoe iii 's multiplayer system strongly discourages this , since you need to play the same civ over and over again to get good cards . 
  for me , the reason i do not enjoy age ii is n't the basic design choices , it 's the execution . 
  it feels like a perfectly fine game concept , with execution that has aged exceptionally poorly . 
  pathfinding is lacking ( though still much better than age 1 ) . 
  units are far too easy to kite : i 'll regularly find my guys have run half way across the map because one scout briefly walked past , on they 'll break formation constantly to attack a tiny house nearby . 
  build queues are just ** bad ** . 
  the grid building option feels outdated and clunky . 
  the graphics scaling means that getting your guys to mine gold when it 's directly behind a forest is painfully difficult . 
  civs all feel exactly the same , with only a few minor differences . 
  the campaigns are a slog to get through with the limited voice acting and animations , not to mention the fact that you have to molly-coddle your heroes so they do n't die . 
  i actually feel precisely the opposite of you regarding graphics . 
  i far more frequently find myself confused as to who 's doing what where in age ii than in age iii . 
  this might be partly to do with the more unique unit types , or the superior graphics , or something else . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  all i know is that i 'm far more aware of what 's going on in age iii than ii . 
  but aside from knowing what 's going on , age ii just * looks * like a really old , outdated game , and that 's unappealing . 
  aom is n't much younger than it and looks vastly better , and age 3 looks practically like a modern game despite being over a decade old . 
  both age of mythology and age iii are better than age ii in all of these respects . 
  the simple use of a 3d engine and pixel placement ( rather than grid placement ) of building would be an * enormous * upgrade to age ii to make it feel like a modern , playable game . 
  the diversity is second most important , because if i 'm playing as the ottomans i want it to feel really distinct from playing teutons or germany . 
  i agree with you regarding economic management , home city levelling ( i love the idea of home cities , but being forced to grind the same civ in order to level up and unlock the higher level cards is something i do * not * like , particularly in multiplayer ) , and * maybe * , to * some * extent , the stuff about `` empire building '' . 
  but all that pales in comparison to overall gameplay experience in my opinion , and age 3 is just a slicker game . 
   all art , music and atmosphere seem to be more developed for aoe3, 
  oh boy , this is something i do n't think i 've seen mentioned before , but it is ** such ** a powerful effect and important part of why i prefer age 3 . 
  yeah this is my hope too . 
  evolving from the victorian to edwardian , and then through wwi has some incredible potential , with the development of early machine guns , tanks , and planes near the end . 
  i 'd absolutely * love * to see how an rts game would tackle trench warfare too . 
   no more fortress building , many cultures would be not relevant , no melee units, 
  are you even * vaguely * familiar with history ? 
  * fortress building was relevant still in world war ii ( heard of the maginot line ? ) . 
  * bayonets were relevant up until and including at * least * world war i. 
  * the anglo-zulu war , the opium wars , and the franco-siamese war all show a wide variety of different cultures being potentially relevant in the period from victorian eras up until the end of the 19th century . 
   exactly , up until the 19th century, 
  i mean ... sure , the ones i picked were then . 
  but you 've also got , you know ... world war i , which was fought by nations as varied as australia , the ottoman empire , and japan , as well as the more well-known european powers , and the campaigns in africa . 
  and outside of wwi , you 've got early 20th century wars like the russo-japanese war , the balkan wars , and the sino-soviet conflict , as well as various rebellions , wars of independence , and civil wars . 
  the late 19th and early 20th centuries were an * enormous * period of upheaval with a ** lot ** of major conflicts . 
  it 's an incredibly good place to set a game centred around battles . 
  sorry , if it was n't clear . 
  the paragraph you quoted is me talking about age of empires ** 2 ** , not 3 . 
  hey , i 'm trying to do some stuff with the [ reddit_comments dataset on google bigquery ] ( https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2015_08?pli=1 ) , but i noticed something odd . 
  all the comments i 've exported from 2015-09-01 onwards have no data in the `` name '' field . 
  the field is still * there * for all of the more recent tables , but it 's just not populated at all . 
  anyone know why ? 
  or what a good way of getting around this is ? 
   i never found pathfinding to be anything less than adequate, 
  i do n't know what game you 're playing , but it 's clearly a very different one from the one i 've experienced . 
  either that or you have much lower criteria for what constitutes adequate pathfinding . 
   your units wo n't go chase a scout for half the map if you use defensive stance, 
  i do n't use stances very much , in any game . 
  i 've never had a problem in aom or aoe3 with this , but in aoe2 i always do . 
   grid building is something i actually prefer in most games, 
  but ... why ? 
  it 's literally just a worse made game . 
   i never had problems with targeting gold behind a forest, 
  how ? 
  you ca n't rotate the screen , and the trees are so big they literally cover up the space . 
   civs have differences in unit compositions , buildings they can make, 
  barely . 
  it 's 90 % just differences in what parts of the same overarching tech tree they can unlock . 
  there 's a small amount of uniqueness in terms of each civ 's unique units from the fortress , but it has nowhere near the sort of diversity you see in aom or age 3 . 
   the campaigns were the one of the best single-player rts experiences, 
  they 're all so ... * bland * , though . 
  the stories do n't do an awful lot to engage you , and they are further hurt by the fact that they do n't have cut scenes and animations , and by the fact that you ca n't actually use your main heroes , because letting them die forces you to redo the entire bloody level . 
  not really ironic . 
  they 're two very different sports . 
  the ball is much harder to hit in baseball , and the connection between hitting the ball and scoring runs is a little looser . 
  hey , this is off topic for this particular thread , but from my searching i think you 're either the creator of , or at least very familiar with , [ this google bigquery dataset of user comments ] ( https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2015_08?pli=1 ) ? 
  i 've been trying to do some stuff with that data set , but i noticed something odd . 
  all the comments i 've exported from 2015-09-01 onwards have no data in the `` name '' field . 
  the field is still there for all of the more recent tables , but it 's just not populated at all . 
  i was wondering if perhaps you could help explain to me why that is , and/or what i can do to get a consistent output ( my intent , once i 've exported all the data , is to use a script to convert the `` name '' into a direct link to the comment , like how [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/6vxi3x/pushshiftio_api_documentation_for_searching/dm9y6ui/ ) goes to the other comment in this thread ) . 
  thanks !, 
  nearly 30 pounds ? 
  damn , i wish i could get d&d books for that price ... ca n't get the books here for anything less than $ 59.95 . 
  wow dude . 
  what happened to get you so grumpy ? 
  to lash out so unnecessarily at random strangers being helpful . 
  it 's aus , and it 's still about $ 10 more , which is especially bad when you consider that the uk 's vat rate is * double * australia 's gst . 
  it * was * brought up in the initial episode . 
  some people thought that the initial episode went ** too far ** in terms of pointing that out . 
  amazon is shit .
