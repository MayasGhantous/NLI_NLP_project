  but i saw it on a tv news show . 
   `` til about ... '' and other broad posts do n't belong on til . 
   no personal opinions , anecdotes or subjective statements, 
  it 's a shame , too , because if you had changed the second sentence to `` 4 -- 10 years earlier than this period , free/sliding-scale reproductive care was made available '' , it would 've been brilliant . 
  really interesting question , and i 'd suspect you 're right . 
  however , i 'd also reckon most gamers are currently on 7 , so there 's really no need to upgrade , it 's not that much of an advantage . 
  what really confuddles me is why anyone would go from xp to 7 , rather than to 8 . 
  i have one criticism , unless you are expecting people to mix and match builds . 
  to me , it makes sense to go from 8 to 16 gb way before the * extremist * model . 
  i 'd probably switch it up at the * outstanding * model , if not * excellent * ( and would probably go to 32 gb at the very top model ) . 
  my desktop 's 9800 gt and an e8500 @ 3.16 ghz ( no overclocking ) . 
  prelude in e minor from preludes op. 28 . 
  it 's no. 4 . 
  it was so weird for me when i first saw this video ( ages ago , now ) , because i was actually learning that exact prelude at the time . 
  i should clarify :, 
  the improvements in windows 8 over windows 7 are minor . 
  upgrading does n't gain much , so for most people it does n't make sense to change at all . 
  however , if you 're currently on xp , and are going to upgrade anyway , it does n't make sense to upgrade to what is already an out-of-date version . 
  there are enough benefits to win8 that if you 're upgrading anyway , it makes sense to go to the newest version . 
  but 8 has already been demonstrably not a vista . 
  vista had two major problems : lack of driver support ( from third parties ) and spec requirements that were too high for what was being provided by most oems . 
  other than that , vista was n't really a horrible operating system . 
  that said , 7 was still a large upgrade from vista , so even if you had vista later on after those problems were solved , the upgrade of just one version was still worthwhile . 
  god damn it , now you 've got me trying to think of a way of wording the intent to * not kill someone 's kids * in a way that ca n't be misrepresented like this ... 
  i ... i ca n't do it ... 
  do n't forget base 64 !, 
  edit : put it onto two lines to make it easier to read . 
  it should actually be a single string . 
   the xbox controller definitely feels better, 
  no , it does n't * definitely * feel better . 
  that 's your opinion , and you 're entitled to it , but i disagree whole-heartedly . 
   of course we would ... do that, 
   of course we [ would ] do that, 
  i 'm a dual-os user , with a mac laptop and a windows desktop , and typing accents is so much easier on mac , so i did all my french written work on it . 
  however , when i did need to type french on windows , i would switch keyboard layouts . 
  i had a quick keyboard shortcut set up to switch between them , and would just press it , type the letter with the accent , and switch back . 
  if you 're a qwerty typer , however , it 's probably not to hard to just learn azerty to stick to the whole time when writing in french , just a few letters switched around . 
  ( i type in dvorak , so the change would have been far too significant for this to be feasible for me . ), 
  eh , i 'd say the majority of native english speakers who live in a place that only speaks english natively only speak english . 
  it 's certainly true of australia , and i think also the uk . 
  i 'd hazard a guess it 's true for a very large portion of non-french canada , but that one 's only a guess . 
  that 's all great , but i thought slaughterhouse was saying his mistake was to literally put it in , and leave it laying in there . 
  a ) from just the top few top-level comments there , i think they seem to be telling him to be cautious, 
  b ) even if the comments were all for it , i 'm not sure that 's exactly `` the exact opposite reaction seen here '' . 
  here it seems to be promoting the idea that the adoptive parent is their dad/mum , but not necessarily saying that the biological parent should avoid them completely . 
   he simply placed the most commonly used letters in hard to reach positions, 
  not true . 
  it 's a common myth , but in fact the letters on the qwerty keyboard were designed to keep commonly used letter-pairs separated . 
  typing any random two keys in succession is not what caused jamming , but two neighbouring keys in succession . 
  qwerty is all-caps , because it describes the top few letters of the top row , azerty and qwertz are the same . 
  dvorak , however , uses a capital d but other letters lower-case , because it comes from the name of its creator . 
  the article was kinda painful to read , because of those mistakes mentioned above , but also just the rampant grammatical errors throughout . 
  still , it 's a great message and i support anyone trying to get more people to join the dvorak master race . 
  hidden camera, 
  haha no worries mate , i was n't amongst the downvoters , and it would seem to have turned the other way now anyway . 
  holy shit , nice detective work there . 
  ignore the difference in usernames , / u/spam4119 did some snooping . 
  they would appear to own the same dog, 
   do n't worry . 
  on his account he has this picture posted :, 
  and on her account she has this photo :, 
  same dog . 
  it 's legit . 
  i hate to be `` that guy '' , but i 've removed it . 
  wikipedia is n't the place for this stuff , guys , head over to [ uncyclopedia ] ( http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/main_page ) , and [ play to your heart 's content ] ( http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/battle_of_brisbane ) . 
  hey scrumptious , i 've got a friend asking for a sad piano duet , do you know of any ? 
  i googled , and the first result was yahoo answers , suggesting a schubert fantasy , but she did n't like it . 
  why were they not charged with perjury ? 
  if we found unintelligent multicellular life on mars , it would imply that steps 2 -- 6 of hanson 's 9 steps of the evolutionary path to galactic colonisation are easy . 
  step 1 is the right star system with the right conditions for life ( goldilocks zone , organic compounds , etc. ) . 
  2 -- 6 describe the formation of multi-cellular organisms , from reproductive molecules like rna , to sexual reproduction , and finally multi-cellular organisms . 
  this would mean that only steps 7 ( tool-using , large brained animals ) , 8 ( our current advancement ) or 9 ( interstellar colonisation on a large scale ) can be the problem . 
  the reasoning here is that if it could have occurred on both earth and mars , the chances of those steps occurring given step 1 , must be quite high . 
  do n't forget , a lot of the us is also inland , and that makes a big difference with the weather , too ( more variation with the seasons ) . 
  it might 've , but it was unsourced . 
  i think she 's after four hands . 
  i 'm on mobile at the moment , but i noticed the link is a list of all schubert 's compositions . 
  did he write a lot of music for piano duet/four hands ? 
  ah , awesome , thanks !, 
  i do n't suppose you know where i could listen to the `` grand funeral march in c minor , op . 
  i 've found [ this on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-snwcezijc ) , but it does n't seem to match up with [ this sheet music from imslp ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/ff/imslp54280-pmlp21679-schubert_werke_breitkopf_serie_9_no_64_op_55.pdf ) . 
  no , there is n't any evidence , you 're absolutely right . 
  i considered that it may have been poorly worded fact or something similar , but decided even if that is the case , it needs to go , per wp : v ( it was n't sourced ) . 
  i use both the youtube ( though my keyword is `` youtube '' ) and the reddit ones , as well as a whole host of others ( piratebay and wikipedia get used the most ) . 
  i did n't realise people actually used `` i 'm feeling lucky '' , but hey , it 's really cool to be able to do it this way if you like it . 
  i thought copyright was original 20 years . 
  i say go back to that . 
  there 's no reason to go below it . 
  i 'd be super happy with 50 years , though . 
  much better than life + 70 years ... 
  edit : pretty sure i 'm wrong , it was originally less . 
  ignore me . 
  editedit : definitely wrong , in the us it was originally 14 years . 
  fair enough . 
  i 've never used ifl even before any of that stuff , tbh . 
  but like i said , if you do , then more power to you !, 
  i use `` image '' for google image search, 
  `` sheetmusic '' to search imslp,
