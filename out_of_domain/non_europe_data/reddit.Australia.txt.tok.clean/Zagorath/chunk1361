  nope . 
  try reading the actual words i 'm saying , instead of making completely unfounded assumptions . 
  fuck your reading comprehension is shit . 
  i 'm someone who will stay in the left lane except when absolutely necessary . 
  if the guy in front of me is going 10 under the limit , there 's a good chance i 'll happily sit behind him doing the same , unless they 're doing that for too long . 
  only if they go way below that , or they stay that way for too long , will i gun it and overtake -- before promptly getting back in the left lane as quick as is safe . 
  i 'm disappointed that the tylenol strait is n't near panadol . 
   i 'm the guy doing 140kph in the left lane undertaking those 100kph drivers, 
  oh great . 
  so not only is your reading comprehension bad , but you 're also a dangerous and illegal driver to boot . 
  i ** specifically ** called out right lane hogs as wrong . 
  that 's what the phrase `` two wrongs do n't make a right '' means . 
  here 's a hint that will make your life much better . 
  try to assume good intent when there is no reason not to . 
  it 'll make your life a lot happier . 
  if they wanted that to be the design philosophy of the game , they should have put it in the player 's handbook and the dungeon master 's guide as a rule . 
  yes , that should be fine . 
  just make sure you 're backing up to one of them * very * regularly ( at least daily ) , and backing up the off-site one quite regularly ( at least monthly , preferably weekly , although really it depends on your own tolerance to loss ) . 
  the absolute most important part of ** any ** backup system -- more important than any technical details of how the backups are stored or performed , or how many backups you have and what type of medium they 're on -- is just that the backup system * does get used * . 
  because it would n't matter if your system involved a hundred copies in 50 discrete locations scattered across the globe ; if you do n't back up at all for 6 months straight because you 're lazy or it 's too difficult , that system wo n't help you . 
  i was about to ask if you 're in germany , but it turns out [ germany is actually one of the rather small list of countries that this video * is * able to be watched in ] ( https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d6cnvohi4yz0 ) . 
  you said it yourself mate , you 're going 140 in a 110 zone . 
  i 'm not making anything up . 
  hmm , that 's odd . 
  how are you trying to watch it ? 
  maybe it 's one of those ones that does n't work on mobile/embedded videos ? 
  so if you were watching it on your phone or using the embedded res player , try going to the youtube watch page on a desktop computer ? 
  as far as i can tell it 's not a region restriction , because it * usually * tells you that the reason it 's not working is due to region restriction , plus the site i linked before , as well as [ this other one ] ( https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker/#url=6cnvohi4yz0 ) both say it should be available in sweden . 
  if the only error message is `` this video is not available '' , i 'd definitely say it 's at least worth trying to reload it again later . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't be much help here ... sorry . 
   pretty sure my post says 110kph . 
  it said 140 when i first loaded up the page . 
  looks like you ninja edited it . 
  do n't try to pretend you did n't . 
  that makes me wonder . 
  was the edit because you made a legitimate typo and wanted to correct it , or was it because you know you * do * drive at 140 , but decided it was a bad idea to admit to being a fuckwit ? 
  i can never know which of those it is , and i 'm not about to pass judgement unfairly , so i 'll just assume it was an honest typo . 
  but now i 'll know that if i see a white audi rs3 going past clearly way above the speed limit , i 'll make sure to report it . 
  i normally do n't bother reporting that sort of thing , but i may just make an exception for white audi rs3s . 
  have you tried reaching out to your teachers and explaining exactly why you need to be able to change the keyboard layout ? 
  it 's important for productivity as well as for health , so it 's something they should hopefully be okay with making an exception on , if they 're even a little bit reasonable . 
  [ here 's the vryloka homebrew ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) that / u/merzor mentioned . 
  they 're not all exactly day-to-day , but some of the spells from [ the starter spells unearthed arcana ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/ua-starter-spells.pdf ) are really interesting . 
  * ceremony * is an especially great spell with far more utility for the common person than for adventurers . 
  i also quite like * guiding hand * and * sense emotion * . 
  for hunters , the * snare * spell could be an incredible daily tool .

  i think a dex save against an attack which is a * roar * seems a little strange . 
  i 'd be more inclined to make it a strength or con save . 
  but maybe i 'm just picturing the ability incorrectly ? 
  on the one hand , the deception is pretty scummy . 
  on the other hand , the other sub has the clearly better name . 
  who thought up the idea of naming a subreddit about gifs of pigs pi gifs ? 
  this sort of photo is technically really easy to get . 
  the hard part is being in the right place at the right time . 
  you just need a nice wide open aperture and a long lens , and a knowledge of how to use autofocus ( since you 'll want to force it to focus on the eye , and not the beak ) . 
  it 's a good tip for any portraiture , really . 
  you most often hear it for close ups of people , but it quite obviously works here as well . 
  as humans we 're evolved to concentrate on the eye , so keeping that in sharp focus makes for better photos most of the time . 
  you see quite a lot of people who are proud of their lack of knowledge when it comes to music . 
  it 's really quite common , and it almost always comes from people who are sub-par musicians . 
  it 's no bloody wonder why . 
  hans zimmer is the same way . 
  proud of the fact that he 's had no musical training . 
  well mate , it 's no wonder your scores are some of the most generic and bland out there . 
  and yet , unfortunately , the masses eat it up . 
  call him a genius . 
  i think the problem is that on this subreddit , there are quite a few people who legitimately * would * say stuff like that . 
  it 's good ol' poe 's law . 
  ** i ** know you 're quite a bit more rational than that , but there 's no particular reason that someone who is n't on this subreddit quite so frequently might . 
  what about 11 ? 
  you wo n't get an answer to that on here , because you 're asking for legal advice . 
  if it matters to you a lot , contact a lawyer . 
  people have a tendency to hate what they do not understand . 
   i do not understand what the hell a dab is or why anyone would think it is cool , therefore i hate dabbing .
