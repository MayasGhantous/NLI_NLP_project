  is how it goes, 
   i just wanted to know if it was illegal or not, 
  that 's legal advice . 
  see the sidebar . 
  even if you 're fine with everything else , how can you think changing the subscriber numbers using css to make yourself look much bigger -- and like another subreddit -- is n't `` doing anything wrong '' ? 
  who did / r/flashtv steal from ? 
  and how would shane be responsible anyway , considering they only became a mod of that 4 months ago , and the subreddit 's css does n't seem super different now from ages ago . 
   linus torvalds ... says you should n't ever use more than 3 levels of indentation or your code is bad . 
  that 's utter bullshit . 
  in object oriented programming that would make it impossible to do * anything * . 
  inside your class has one level . 
  inside a method in the class has two . 
  inside a loop that 's your third . 
  oh , and you 're not allowed conditionals inside your loop , because that would be four and that 's bad code . 
  but even in a language like c it 's not exactly sane . 
  inside a function is 1 . 
  inside a loop within a loop ( for reading from 2d arrays ) gives you 3 . 
  and again , you 're not allowed conditionals . 
  if you 're right that torvalds makes that claim , then he 's not just being eccentric hl by making it . 
  he 's plain wrong . 
  and his ability to write good code does n't have any impact on the fact that his code * style * rules are apparently ridiculous . 
  also , outside of politics , she 's just not a very good pianist . 
  i mean , she 's miles better than me or most people on this subreddit . 
  but she plays like a robot . 
  all skill , no feeling . 
  if it 's meant to be force damage , the only way i see that working is if it 's meant to be something similar to godzilla 's atomic breath . 
  if you want it to be literally just a really powerful roar , then i 'd say either thunder , representing the sheer shock wave and noise , or bludgeoning to represent the physical air particles hitting them . 
  if you go with an force breath type thing , then keeping it as dex seems okay . 
  for the thunder damage , i 'd go with con . 
  for the air particles , i 'd go with strength , and consider adding a knock back effect on failure . 
  i 'd maybe also consider the knock back on thunder damage tbh . 
  some spells worth looking at for comparison : * storm sphere * , * investiture of wind * , * thunderwave * , * destructive wave * , * thunderclap * , and maybe * eldritch blast *, 
   diversity of options in tech and army composition , with civilizational unique parts built into the universal tech tree . 
  think aoe2, 
  i do n't know much about starcraft , so i ca n't comment on the comparison , but imo aoe2 is terrible on the diversity front . 
  it 's all basically the same , which is dull as ** fuck ** . 
  i 'd much rather unit diversity be more similar to age of mythology or aoe3 than to aoe2 . 
  it 's a new game entirely . 
  they 're also doing definitive editions of age 1 , 2 , and 3 . 
  age 1 de is coming out later this year . 
  no etas on any of the other games , but it 's likely that age 2 de will be next , followed by age 3 . 
  i doubt age 4 will be coming out until after that . 
  so expect to wait at least a couple of years , probably until early next decade , before this game is on shelves . 
  just ... not * too * hype , yet . 
  yup . 
  i have exactly 4 phone numbers memorised . 
  * my own mobile number , because it 's handy to be able to hand it out without needing to look it up, 
  * my sister 's mobile number , because it 's a particular pattern of numbers that really rolls off the tongue, 
  * my childhood landline , because back then we had to have that stuff memorised , and it 's just never left . 
  pretty sure it 's not even in service any more . 
  because it 's fucking 000 . 
  i see no reason to expend any effort to remember any other numbers . 
  i would n't even have my sister 's if it were n't so damn easy . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  hey sorry , but this post is being removed . 
  this subreddit is for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  looks like you 're bleeding on to the third column on page 3 . 
  yep , you 're 100 % correct in this . 
  for all things stealth , there 's [ an excellent sage advice segment on the official d&d podcast which discusses the mechanics and design intentions of stealth in-depth ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/james-haeck-dd-writing ) . 
  the d&d podcast is really worth listening to for * all * the sage advice segments , to be honest . 
  it 's much more in-depth and interesting than the sage advice columns on the website , which mostly boil down to `` read this bit of the player 's handbook '' , and `` it 's bloody obvious you moron '' . 
  but this one particular episode is * especially * good . 
  i started out with arrow while on a plane i just randomly stumbled across it on the in-flight entertainment system . 
  this was shortly after i had gotten in to young justice , during the christmas break in season 1 . 
  roy harper/red arrow/speedy ( and by extension , green arrow ) being such an important part of young justice , i thought it 'd be really cool to watch a show based on them . 
  i binge watched about 6 episodes on the plane , and immediately went to download the rest once i got home . 
  been hooked ever sense , even if the show took a turn for the worse after half way through season 3 , and never recovered . 
  these two shows are what first got me seriously interested in the dc comics lore , beyond just being a really casual fan who watched the big movies that come out or remembering watching a few of the cartoons from when i was a kid . 
  i was under the impression that the reason this may be unconstitutional was at least in part because the funds are being misappropriated . 
  thanks for sharing this . 
  just letting you know , i 'm reflairing it as `` world '' , since resource is intended more for resources that other people can use to make their own homebrew . 
  i think this is why extra history videos are so great . 
  they tell a story , framed in a narratively interesting way , about different events in history . 
  yeah the ottoman empire one was really odd ... they were one of the major players in ww1 , so of course they were still around half a decade * before * it started . 
  nah that 's a shit rule , because it means nothing they put out in another book will ever be treated as proper content . 
  it will never be supported by additional content like race specific feats , or additional subclass choices , etc. 
  it 's a major hamstring on the game as a whole . 
  the lowest stable orbits need the highest velocity . 
  you could theoretically orbit at one metre above the highest point in your path , but you 'd need to be going crazy fast to do it . 
  go way out , and you can orbit much more slowly . 
  the moon orbits at an average of about 1000 ms ^ ( -1 ) . 
  i 'd love to be able to do this . 
  not sure if you can or not . 
  but it sounds so convenient . 
  i often just manually drag the tab into its own space and full screen that way . 
  it 's more work , but the end result is the same .
