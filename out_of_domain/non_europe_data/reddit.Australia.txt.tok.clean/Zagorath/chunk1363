  thrown weapons use the same stat as they would normally use for a melee weapon , if they are a melee weapon with the thrown property . 
  this means they use strength by default , but may use dex if you so choose , if they are a finesse weapon . 
   `` most incompetent country '' from the austrians, 
  the fuck mate ? 
  australia was n't incompetent , they were screwed over by the incompetent british high command giving them fucking retarded orders .

  my had !, 
  i misread austria as australia , since australia 's main battles in wwi were against the ottomans , and it was infamously a campaign which did not go well .

  that 's the biggest advantage / r/unearthedarcana has , not only over dandwiki , but also over the dungeon master 's guild . 
  it fosters a community that cares about providing good feedback , and it 's built on a platform ( reddit ) which highly encourages voting on good content , and on leaving comments discussing things . 
  both those other platforms have no method of curation , and have comment systems that are deeply buried and hidden , and thus are not used very much . 
  therefore the * users * of these sites are the types who are less interested in that . 
  bottom left on android . 
  but without a 3.5 & nbsp ; mm jack . 
  marmite and weetbix . 
  what 's so hard to get about that ? 
  it 's the second best ( by a wide margin ) in both of the product categories . 
  which is why i find it infuriating that the health stars rate weetbix higher . 
  damn rating system is bunk , and not just for the oft-quoted `` because you ca n't compare products from different categories '' reason . 
  could be the rejects from the same factory or something . 
   milo , the cereal, 
  what was the title of this thread , again ? 
  i blame this on the government . 
  any company can and should do whatever it legally can to reduce the tax it pays . 
  it 's up to the government to make sure they ca n't legally do it . 
  i still buy vita brits anyway . 
  they 're healthier and imo taste better . 
  hey , at least feeding the magpies might make them like you , and therefore target someone else in their murderous rampaging starting in a few weeks . 
  right . 
  as someone who 's not really even vaguely familiar with this game , it was amusing , but i 'm curious about the stereotypes in it . 
  so people really do stuff like this ? 
  you 're right , it definitely is n't . 
  guys is totally a gender neutral term !, 
  in the right context , even the word `` man '' can be gender neutral . 
  like , saying to a female friend `` come on man '' . 
  sadly it 's also one way that a lot of men get turned off from the issue entirely , which it kinda looks like the comment you replied to , as well as chunderous 's comment , are example of . 
  i was implying milo as a cereal ( and by extension , milo as anything other than a drink ) is also treasonous . 
  so , still much lower than just downloading them , then ? 
  sneakernet is only efficient for very high quantities . 
  if they 'll only send you 3 dvds at a time , it 's gon na be much less efficient than downloading . 
  but if they would send a whole hard drive , that 's pretty damn good . 
  i think i remember hearing that the star system places undue weight on the amount of fat , and not enough on sugar , relative to current nutritional understanding . 
  deco1400 was easy, 
  so , i 'm a minute in to this now . 
  at what point does it stop being easy listening ? 
  what channing said is exactly the way that i typically play this . 
  gnossienne 1 , yeah ? 
  i 'm only 5 minutes in so far . 
  great video , but i 've stopped it here to point out one rather minor nitpick with the terminology used . 
  the design you talked about , matt , is just about the * opposite * of object-oriented . 
  oo is about * not * needing to replicate functionality , and about being able to declare that one object is a particular type of another one , without needing to manually specify each of the traits it has . 
  a true object oriented approach * would * be to simply define `` incorporeal '' , and then say `` all incorporeal monsters have the following traits , unless otherwise specified '' . 
  then each monster would simply have the trait `` incorporeal '' somewhere on them . 
  not that i think that an oo approach ( as i 'm describing it , anyway ) would be a good idea . 
  just the opposite . 
  i agree entirely with you that the way they have done it is best . 
  the only problem i have is with the terminology you used . 
  did you drop this : ` ( ` ? 
  the artist 's impressions also have the cycle path turning in what is * much * to sharp a corner . 
  i would n't put too much stock in them :p, 
   apethetic public, 
  well i do n't know how we were meant to react , when the press ( you know , the guys supposed to be responsible for * informing the public * so as to * keep the politicians * *** in check *** ) did n't say a peep about it until * after * it passed . 
  not sure if you know or not , but in australia a `` spider '' is actually a type of drink . 
  it 's what people from many other places might call a `` float '' .
