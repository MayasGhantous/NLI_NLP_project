  ice cream plus soft drink . 
  in korea , cider is a brand of lemonade . 
  as in , if you ask for a cider , the restaurant might reply `` is a sprite okay ? '', 
  or `` is a 7-up okay ? '', 
  i have no idea how that name came about . 
  you jest , but / r/mandelaeffect 's audience is fucking nutters , and legitimately does believe that reality has changed/there are multiple realities that they 've somehow moved between . 
  it 's both . 
  the mandela effect is the phenomenon where lots of people share the same false memory . 
  some people choose to explain this through clinically insane means . 
  some people look for ... like ... actual reasons . 
   a lot of ib students are at really top notch excellent schools and they genuinely ca n't sympathise with us, 
  yeah , i think you 've hit the nail on the head there . 
  i 've never really understood just why so many in this subreddit seem to hate ib . 
  i went to a fantastic school . 
  i do n't know how they did when i was there ( graduated 2012 ) , but last year the school 's * average * was over 37 points . 
  they 've definitely improved since i was there , but even at the time it was great . 
  so i guess it just makes it hard to think about what it might be like if the school * is n't * good . 
  not that i did n't have problems . 
  my maths teacher was uninspiring at best ( though i did n't recognise it at the time ) , my year 12 physics teacher was so bad that we had to basically learn the whole syllabus in year 13 , and for the first two terms of year 12 my economics teacher spent most lessons just telling us to go do our own research -- he was fired at the end of the year and we ended up sharing with the hl class , and learning the whole syllabus in a little over a year . 
  chinese taste for foreign films ( i do n't know what their taste is for locally-made films , so ca n't comment ) is * exceptionally * low-brow . 
  i ca n't say for certain why this is , but i suspect it 's a combination of education levels and language & cultural barriers . 
  the sorts of american movies that do well in china , like pirates and warcraft , have a tendency to rely more on spectacle than deeper understanding . 
  if people are n't buying bin liners , and they are n't using plastic bags , what in the hells are they doing with their rubbish ? 
  krispy kreme here often partners with 7/11 . 
  you buy their stuff in there . 
  i 've also seen them in airports . 
  another american chain we * do * have here , somewhat ironically , is outback . 
  why would you go anywhere other than red rooster if you want chips though . 
  they make the perfect bloody things . 
  yeah but tasmania is n't a real place . 
  except he clearly does look older between those two photos . 
  maybe not the 26 years older he should be , but at * least * 10 years older . 
  good bot, 
  uk prime minister, 
  i 've never heard of that fast food franchise . 
  where do they have chains ? 
  aww man . 
  will have to keep it in mind for next time i visit canberra . 
  lol wtf . 
  over 10 % fat by weight , and over 20 % sugar . 
  by both modern and older nutritional understanding it 's not healthy . 
  what exactly was the basis of their claim ? 
   i do n't know if that controlled for the small number of yellow cars on the road, 
  it literally would have * had * to . 
  even the most basic primary school understanding of statistics would be doing this as percentages , not raw numbers . 
  it would be laughed at in peer review if it did n't do this . 
   or the potential correlation between yellow car lovers , and people who are no fun . 
  good point . 
  this may not have been controlled for . 
  i got my license last week on my first go ( aged 23 ) , after lessons through no yelling . 
  will also vouch for them . 
  you 're right , timbre is super important . 
  ... in serious performances . 
  of which this is * not * one . 
  every can be two or three , depending on the speaker , the sentence , and the context . 
   [ someone else ] is everything wrong with how people argue now . 
  i would seriously pay money to have his family killed, 
  you do n't see the irony in putting these two sentences next too each other ? 
  i would go a step further and just say all mmos where i do n't have pre-established friends to play them with . 
  i had possibly thousands of hours of runescape between 2003 and 2007 , and hundreds of hours of flyff between 2007 and 2009 , but with both of them , i had heaps of people that i knew in real life that i occasionally played with , and through them was able to meet more people in the game . 
  but i 've tried going back into flyff since then , and i 've tried picking up a bunch of other mmos , but when it has n't been accompanied by friends i 've just never been able to make one stick . 
  ** half-life ** . 
  i get that its mechanics may have been groundbreaking for its time , but looking back on it , the mechanics feel fairly bland . 
  the shooting is n't bad by any means , but just bland . 
  the * other * mechanics in the game . 
  ladders , platforming ( in particular jumping ) , and moving boxes , are all absolutely * abysmal * , even for their time . 
  ** age of empires ii ** . 
  i enjoyed it heaps at the time ; i 'm a huge fan of rts games in general , and the age franchise in particular . 
  age of mythology might just be my favourite game of all time . 
  but i do n't feel like age 2 has ... aged ... very well . 
  your units do stupid things like run half way across the map just because one enemy scout came near . 
  the grid-based building system feels clunky and outdated by modern standards . 
  the 2d engine plus the graphics style means that when there 's a gold mine behind trees , it 's really hard to deal with . 
  i 'm still hyped for both age 1 and age 2 definitive editions though . 
  hoping that they might address some of my concerns and make the game way more fun to play . 
  ** dragon age : origins ** . 
  loved the story and characters and world . 
  hated the mechanics . 
  i ca n't really pin down why . 
  i loved mass effect . 
  but da was just tedious to get through . 
   labor could of pushed it through, 
  labor could * have * pushed it through . 
   if turnbull had any stones he would change the party 's policy as its a win win, 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  it might cause more people ( both voters and members ) to jump ship for the conservative party . 
  it could very likely cost turnbull himself his leadership . 
  if the entire liberal party was a bit more forward thinking , they might see it the way you do . 
  it would be a * fantastic * move overall for them politically , because they could throw it in labor 's face , and i bet there are a lot more moderates who will vote labor because of marriage equality than there are conservatives who 'll jump away from the lnp because of it . 
  but they are the major conservative party in this country , so it is in their very nature * not * to be forward thinking . 
  seriously bot ? 
  you reply to me , but not the person who actually got it wrong ? 
   i find that many times lazy teachers take advantage of the ib buzzword `` independent learners '' and use it as an excuse just not to teach, 
  haha . 
  now that you mention it , it 's possible that that 's what happened with my economics teacher . 
  i think he was pretty new . 
  my physics teacher , on the other hand , was just over it . 
  it was his last year at the school , and i just think he was beyond caring any more . 
  that is definitely part of it . 
  in relation to its shooter mechanics .
