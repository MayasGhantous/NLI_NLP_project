  but it uses a lot of other mechanics which are just plain * bad * , as i explained in my earlier comment . 
  10 gold seems like an awful lot for a servant to be starting with . 
  i 'd be more inclined to drop it down to 2 , and make the slaves start with maybe 5 silver . 
  just , fwiw , i say i stopped in 2017 , but it was actually right at the beginning of the year . 
  long before any of the controversial changes that happened in that year . 
  my reason for stopping was mostly that my friend groups had moved to flyff . 
  for what it 's worth , google assistant has some stupid behaviours like this , too . 
  depending on the precise way you phrase it , asking for `` when is [ person in my contacts ] 's birthday '' might :, 
  * find that person in your contacts and tell you their * phone number and email address * but * not * their birthday, 
  * say `` these came back from a search '' , and just give you the google results for that query, 
  * give you a google knowledge graph card back based on a famous person with the same name as your contact, 
  but there is no way , in google assistant , to get it to actually tell you your contact 's birthday . 
  this despite the google now app , and the google web page , being able to do it just fine . 
  that 's not a `` plus '' thing , it 's right there in the comment you replied to . 
   that powder puff of a serve, 
  why is linus looking at my mac ? 
  nah i think giving suicidal people the pope 's number is a good solution . 
   even if there is a yes vote , the coalition will still stall and complain and delay, 
  maybe , but i think it more likely that they 'll do it , but they 'll do it in an extremely limited way . 
  allow companies like florists , venues , and cake makers to discriminate on the basis of sexuality , for example . 
  they 'll do this , because they know that if they * do * stall and wait for the next election , labor will win and implement * proper * marriage equality , which is their worst-case-scenario . 
  i ca n't find anyone reporting on the * reason * the high court ruled this way . 
  is it on standing , or the substance of the arguments ? 
  that just sounds like shit dming , imo . 
  it 's basically tpk by dm fiat . 
  so they have n't even announced whether it was based on standing or on the substance of the arguments ? 
   this votr added a heap of younger voters to the registry, 
  there 's little evidence that it added many more to the registry than would have otherwise registered if a federal election were held now . 
   younger voters and tending to skew to the left/labour [ sic ] / greens voting, 
  true , but younger voters are also less likely to use the postal service , less likely to care enough about politics to vote if it 's not compulsory , and less likely to have faith that the government will bother listening to their voices . 
  compared to if this were done by a proper compulsory plebiscite , there is a much higher chance of this failing . 
  which tweets would those be ?

  bad bot, 
  and yet my phone triggers itself on average twice per evening when i 've got it out at d&d sessions . 
  while * still * somehow frequently telling me my voice was not recognised and i have to unlock my phone before it 'll work . 
  it 's somehow the worst of both false positives and false negatives . 
  got some links to examples ? 
   i 'm unreliably told it was a unanimous decision though, 
  abc article now reports this . 
  do n't think it 's `` unreliably told '' any more . 
  if it were compulsory i would be willing to bet money on it passing . 
  and i am not a betting man by a * long * shot . 
  i 'm much less confident in this postal survey passing , which is why i think it absolutely essential to inform everyone of the risk of it failing , so as to encourage them to get out the vote . 
  you should get yourself a teacher who can tell you these things . 
  not because of these things per se , that 's pretty easy to figure out online . 
  but because you can not become a good musician being self-taught . 
  you ca n't know when you 're doing something wrong or inefficiently , and the minutiae are impossible to get feedback on when you 're learning without someone there in the room with you to correct you . 
  just a tip , mac should not be all-caps . 
  it 's just a normal proper noun , not an acronym . 
  or rather , it * is * an acronym , but when used as an acronym , it actually means something completely different , and thus writing mac when you mean mac is actually kinda confusing . 
  but the other comments are entirely correct . 
  exfat is the best format to go with . 
  good bot, 
  bad bot, 
  just ... not the joker . 
  this show 's version of the joker was bad . 
   plain greek yoghurt , or smoked salmon scores lower than , milo and strawberry milk, 
  this might be because they 're considered different categories . 
  unfortunately , exactly what the different categories are is ... not intuitive -- or easy to find . 
  i found an abc article that said they are `` food , beverages , oils , spreads , and dairy products '' , and `` dairy products are classified further , depending on calcium content '' . 
  the official website does not have the categories listed ** anywhere ** that i could find online . 
  but they do have a spreadsheet you can download . 
  from what i can tell using the spreadsheet , the categories are :, 
  * beverages , non-dairy, 
  * core dairy - beverages, 
  * core cereals, 
  * fruit, 
  * non-core foods, 
  * protein, 
  * vegetables, 
  * core dairy - yoghurt , soft cheese, 
  * fats , oils, 
  * core dairy - cheese, 
  but whatever they are , you can not use the health star system to compare things in different categories . 
  that is the basic design premise of it , so if you 're trying to compare milo to yoghurt , that 's your fault for doing it wrong . 
  unfortunately , it 's ** still a bad system ** , even if you 're using it correctly . 
  it lists vitabrits as 4 1/2 stars , and weet-bix as 5 stars , despite weet-bix having added sugar and vitabrits not . 
   is anyone else as concerned as i am that apparently the government can use the emergency appropriation funds for pretty much anything they want ? 
  yeah , this is what is astonishing to me , and why i had assumed the case was a slam dunk . 
  i 'm almost hoping that the case was thrown out for lack of standing ( although i ca n't see how ) , since that way at least the court wo n't have ruled allowing them to use emergency funds for anything . 
  at the end , adam says, 
   when primary education became a necessity , we made that free access to everyone , everyone has the option to go to a public school . 
  now that it is so clear that a secondary education is also a necessity ... 
  clearly referring to university as `` secondary '' education . 
  i found this a rather odd little oversight to make . 
  university is tertiary education ... primary school and secondary school ( also known in america as `` elementary '' and `` high '' school ) have been considered a necessity for a long time now , and made freely available to all . 
  i 'm confused . 
  which date ? 
  the date of the blog ?
