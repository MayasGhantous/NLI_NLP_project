  as in , today ? 
  this feels like a long and pointless argument to me . 
  i 'm not sure i really understand why it matters so much which of the two saving throws you 've given it . 
  just give it one strong saving throw and one weak one , whichever ones you think match most closely in terms of flavour . 
  however , if i * were * to weigh in on the argument , i definitely think dex is more valuable than con . 
  i have n't seen any convincing data , and i 'm not sure it 's feasible to * create * a universally correct strict ordering of the saving throws . 
  but my subjective experience has been that dex is probably the most valuable , followed by wis. . con , to me , is the least valuable of the strong saving throws . 
  at my table , i 've rarely seen con saving throws come up in combat situations . 
  it 's usually been either for sustained physical effort over time , or to avoid getting drunk when you 've been drinking too much . 
  dex is super common in combat , but also for things like reaching out to grab a ledge when falling and things like that . 
  yeah , why would your heart skip over that ? 
  surprised at a blog that came out today ? 
  ok , so i guess i understand what the mistake was . 
  but i do n't really understand how it was made . 
  the date comes right after the words `` dev blog '' . 
  i completely forgot about concentration !, 
  it would depend on the caster 's spell list . 
  if it 's like the warlock or paladin , with a lot of conc . 
  spells that form an important part of the class 's functionality , then i would say con jumps up to being * enormously * useful . 
  for casters with fewer conc . 
  spells ( but not none ) , it 's definitely going to jump up quite a bit too , just not as much . 
  oh shit , that 's meant to be caesar ? 
  i just thought it was someone who has reused that quote famously more recently , that i had n't heard of . 
  the suit really throws it off . 
  i 'm not sure who the people in the first one are . 
  anyone able to help me out ? 
  shakespeare 's is obviously meant to be `` to be or not to be '' , but honestly it just reads more naturally as `` 2 or not 2 '' . 
  it does n't have the `` b '' in a place that makes it parse that way . 
  it 's $ 122 * million * , and it 's a * mail * survey . 
   the public in the affirmative are the ones who have been lobbying for it . 
  nope . 
  the public in the affirmative have been very vocally * against * this going ahead . 
  that 's why the senate stopped the real plebiscite , and why the court cases that this thread is about were filed . 
   how can anybody voting yes be legitimately upset that this country is spending an emergency fund on them , that 's what they wanted ??? 
  because they * did n't * want it . 
  they wanted the parliament to do the fucking thing they were elected to do , and represent the wishes and best interests of the population . 
  australian law does not differentiate between men and women for maternity/paternity leave . 
  it recognises `` main carers '' . 
  that 's the assumed default behaviour , but legally it 's about who is the primary carer of the child and who is not . 
  really ? 
  because the only time i see sri in the news is when he 's doing stuff to promote safe cycling . 
  stuff like this post and the sit down a while back . 
  i do n't know what else he 's doing , but promoting cycling and trying to make brisbane a more hospitable place for cyclists is self evidently a very good thing . 
  this comment is being removed due to the fact that it is entirely unconstructive criticism . 
  here on / r/unearthedarcana , we encourage critique , but unfounded insults are not welcome . 
  to be fair , with 12 senators per state , if they receive 10 % of votes , you 'd expect them to get only 1 senator . 
  maybe 2 if they received a large amount of the preference flow . 
  ( roughly 7.7 % of the vote being the quota , by my calculations . ), 
  please explain exactly how `` this idiot is ruining it '' . 
  [ this page , which is linked to from the one you posted ] ( https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave/paid-parental-leave# ) might be a little more useful . 
  note the language, 
   the primary carer, 
   working dads and partners ( including same-sex partners ), 
  or , he could do what he was elected to do , and represent his ward , his beliefs , and the city . 
  by doing unambiguously good things like promoting cycling . 
  those who disagree with him on cycling are, 
  ( a ) objectively wrong , and, 
  ( b ) never going to vote for him anyway . 
  no focus on alternatives ? 
  what the fuck do you think this protest was about, 
  nothing in this says anything about birth givers . 
  only the primary carer . 
  except that that 's not how it ended up going in older editions of the game , when minor actions were just a thing everyone had , but were not necessarily able to do . 
  if you did n't have a useful way to use it , you just did n't . 
  instead , wizards went with the inane wording in the 5e phb , which leads to confusion like we 're seeing here from op . 
  ## ambuscade, 
  i feel this steps on too many toes . 
  doing extra damage in a surprise round is the assassin 's thing . 
  being extra good at initiative is the alert feat 's , as well as the swashbuckler 's thing . 
  1d8 is also really good . 
  it makes it more powerful than a level 1 sneak attack . 
  it will even outperform a level 3 sneak attack a not-insignificant 20 % of the time . 
  i would suggest reducing both dice from 1d8 to 1d6 . 
  this will minimise the degree to which it steps on others ' toes , by making it at * most * equal to these other abilities , rather than being potentially better than them . 
  using a d6 for a clearly rogue-oriented ability is also thematically appropriate . 
  ## apprentice hemomancer, 
  is great . 
  ## breach manoeuvring, 
  really lovely interesting flavour . 
  pretty cool mechanics . 
  i think the design intent here is similar to war caster , in that advantage on an important saving throw is the main feature , plus a few less significant bonuses . 
  however , i think that the `` drop to 1 hp instead '' undermines this . 
  that is , on its own , a very significant ability . 
  i 'd suggest only having one of those two bullet points . 
  the rest is fine . 
  ## expert climber, 
  is fine . 
  seems fun . 
  ## grifter, 
  the third bullet point is very interesting , but feels a touch out of place . 
  being able to deceive people that you are good at something should not actually be able to make you more likely to accomplish that thing . 
  no matter how good i am at lying , i 'm never going to successfully perform a heart operation , or recall some arcane piece of knowledge about a topic i have never even been vaguely exposed to before . 
  i think this bullet point should be reworked to emphasise the fact that you are only * deceiving * people into the * appearance * of success . 
  ## light armour master, 
  makes me a little uneasy . 
  comparing it to medium and heavy armour masters from the phb , it just feels a ** lot ** stronger . 
  ## long march, 
  fun ability , but the wording on the second bullet point is awkward . 
  `` during any short rest that you take for the, 
  entire time '' ... ouch .
