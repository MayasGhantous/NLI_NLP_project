  but either way i am immensely disturbed at how opaque the whole thing was . 
  this is such a serious issue i would certainly have written to my state mp to object , had i the chance . 
  but it 's done now , so one thing worth noting is that just because they have the legal right , does n't mean they have the technical capability . 
  they are n't going to be remotely turning your phone or your smart fridge into spy devices . 
  they 're just not * able * to do that . 
  be very wary of letting any of your devices out of your sight while in police possession , though . 
  i 'd one up you and play the whole first page of liszt 's transcription . 
  after that it gets too hard for me though ... 
  am i transformed with my sheet music ? 
  cause without it i ca n't play shit . 
  maybe the accompaniment part of hallelujah , but i ca n't sing so it 'd just be boring arpeggios and chords . 
  with my music i can do some my interesting things . 
  we have no idea what they 're going to include . 
  they 've been very tight lipped . 
  certainly , i hope it includes their entire backlog , from the dccu ( even if there 's only 1 decent movie in the bunch ) , to the nolan batman , to the '90s batman films ( despite 2 out of 4 being bad , one of which is utterly terrible ) , to the dcau , powerless , and the adam west batman . 
  but we have no idea how much , if any , of that will be available . 
  good bot, 
  you guys are awesome !, 
  any chance true story tuesday will also include links and reminders about / r/gametales and / r/dndgreentext , as alternative subreddits people can also go to to share their stories ? 
  in case you 're not already aware , nearly any classical music can be found for free , completely legally , on imslp . 
  they 're often very high quality , and you 'll be able to print them out yourself ( or pay a printing shop to do it ) for way cheaper than buying from sites like this . 
  [ here 's a link to the rachmaninoff cello sonata ( cello solo parts at the end of the pdf ) ] ( http://ks.imslp.net/files/imglnks/usimg/8/84/imslp105594-pmlp09078-rachmaninov_-_19_-_sonata_g_vc.pf._ ( ed.gutheil \\ ) . pdf ) , or [ here for some other versions of it ] ( http://imslp.org/wiki/cello_sonata,_op.19_ ( rachmaninoff , _ sergei \\ ) ) , if you would prefer . 
  asking for $ 50 for a single piece is just ludicrous . 
  i 've never had this happen on discord , but it definitely happens on reddit when my connection ( or , more often , reddit 's server ) is bad .

   i 'd love to see an ability to use a skillet as a practical weapon, 
  make it a reflavoured mace . 
  easy peasy . 
  spokesperson in this context does n't mean they are the spokesperson * of * the police , it means that they are their party 's spokesperson * about * police-related matters . 
  hear , hear . 
  generations are a stupid , useless concept . 
  the baby boomers range from people born late during the war , all the way up until those who were tweens when the vietnam war ended . 
  they were both the hippies of the '70s and the people the hippies raged against . 
  millenials range from those who grew up with the original star trek films , before tng was ever on the air , to those who were born after the phantom menace ` graced ' our screens . 
  people who grew up without any computer , and people who grew up with smartphones . 
  but even if you narrowed the ranges ( and in what way ? 
  it 's gon na be completely arbitrary no matter what you do ) , there 's still enormous differences between individuals that makes generalisations extremely rough at best . 
  with millenials , you 've got the politically involved greenies , extreme `` sjw `` s , large numbers of politically apathetic people , a rise in libertarianism , and the rise in racism and anti-intellectualism that lead to trump , brexit , and to a lesser extent pauline hanson 's return . 
  trying to make broad claims about a whole generation is just doomed to failure .

  stingrays just intercept your phone 's connection to the cell tower , they ca n't permanently track you no matter where you go , or look through your camera , or do * anything * to a device not in the cellular network . 
  they 're a very effective tool , but they do n't `` turn your phone and fridge into a spy device '' . 
  aside from the inane b blood type thing , what exactly is the reference here ? 
  what is that rhythm meant to be ? 
  other american things that seem to be being adopted to a frustrating degree :, 
  * `` fries '' or `` french fries '', 
  * `` candy '', 
  celebrating the holiday , that is , not the word . 
  also while i 'm at it , i fucking hate when people use `` football '' to refer to soccer . 
  that 's coming from poms , not seppos , but it 's every bit as bad . 
  at this time of year ( spring ) , the average australian is probably more worried about being attacked by killer birds diving at them out of the sky , than venomous creepy crawlies . 
  fucking magpies are the devil incarnate . 
  you guys also have murderous devil birds that swoop down at you as you walk along the footpath ? 
  reflavoured , nice !, 
  i wish i could claim credit for that , but alas , i am not that clever . 
  it 's supposed to , but at least half the time for me it just fucking fails . 
  damn thing is near useless . 
  still good for finding my phone though , because it beeps and * tells me * it failed . 
  it sometimes works with screen off on my pixel , but about half the time it does n't . 
  says it does n't recognise my voice or some shit . 
  mine has always made a noise , and still does . 
  true but this is 20-20 . 
  imo 20-20 is just not cricket . 
  it makes for a great spectacle like this video showed , but it 's not got the spirit of the game . 
  i 'm confused about this entire comment . 
  unless it, 
  * pitches outside leg stump, 
  * pitches outside off stump , hits the batter outside off stump , and the batter was playing a shot, 
  * touched the bat or his gloves , even just slightly , before hitting him elsewhere, 
  like in baseball , it 's possible to curve the ball in the air . 
  this is called swing , in cricket . 
  but because the ball also bounces , it 's possible to make it deviate from its original path a lot more in cricket than in baseball . 
  this is called spin bowling , or seaming , depending on the way in which it 's done . 
  that , plus what the other guys said . 
  i mean , i would n't have known that it was the same person either , except that it 's in the title of the post . 
  hong kong , too . 
  but , i have n't got anything to say to a bear 's arms . 
  what the fuck is this shit place that charges $ 1.50 for sauce and even more for fucking * salt *, 
  i do n't give a fuck what they call it . 
  this is australia , and we call it soccer . 
  we have our own football codes . 
  that 's actually really funny !, 
  in australian english , all of them are chips . 
  i do n't think americans would differentiate between the first two , and would call both of them fries . 
  they 're not going to ignore it . 
  they * could * , just like the uk government * could * have chosen to ignore the result of their brexit plebiscite . 
  but they wo n't , because it would be political suicide . 
  what they will likely do is implement it in the most restricted way they can get away with , such as by allowing exemptions for cake makers and florists and the rest to be allowed to discriminate . 
  while a yes majority will see something get done , what might be interesting will be precisely which members vote `` aye '' on the bill in parliament . 
  some have said they will vote `` no '' no matter what . 
  some have committed themselves to voting the way their own electorate did . 
  and some have declared that they will vote the way the national majority does . 
  i do n't think this will make a difference to the final result , but it will be interesting nonetheless . 
  he still has n't grown a pair . 
  he refused the offer of bill shorten to sign a joint letter in support of marriage equality , for purely petty political reasons, 
   completely unscientific, 
  i 'm as against this poll as anyone else who 's given it thought , but what the fuck is unscientific about it ? 
  it 's being run by the australian bureau of statistics , and it 's being sent out to literally every registered voter in the country .
