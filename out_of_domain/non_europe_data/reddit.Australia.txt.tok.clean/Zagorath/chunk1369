  that 's the best methodology you could possibly hope for . 
  i 've heard nothing but good stories about australian embassies . 
  yeah seriously . 
  i do n't even like sauce on my chips , but if i saw a place charging that much for it i 'd be like : ` no , fuck you . 
  i 'm taking my business elsewhere next time . ', 
  i 've been on oreo for maybe half a week or so now . 
  it made a noise before then , as well as after then . 
  the only time it even * did n't * make a noise for me was on my previous phone , a nexus 4 , when using google now , there was a very brief period of time when it would n't make a noise . 
   not to hand any information over the bbeg that he does not explicitly ask for, 
  i would disagree with this part slightly , for the sole reason that he wo n't * know * what he should be asking for . 
  if his minions get waylaid by some pesky adventurers , he 's going to find that out without needing to consciously ask you about it . 
  true , but i 'm not sure the first page of [ liszt 's transcription of beethoven symphony no. 5 ] ( http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/9/99/imslp01056-beethoven-liszt_symphony-5.pdf ) would be anything to write home about , even then . 
  especially if the orchestral version already exists . 
  it 's only about the first 36 seconds of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovsmpdxuas ) . 
   young people might be less likely to do the survey since they do n't use the postal system much, 
  this is very true . 
   the ultra-poor might be less likely to do it since $ 2 postage actually matters to them, 
  this will , without a shadow of a doubt , ** not ** be a problem , because the survey will be mailed out with prepaid return envelopes . 
   people who do n't feel strongly about the issue , or who just do n't see it as a priority , might be less likely to do the survey, 
  that 's a problem that you will get with * any * survey . 
  non-response bias is a big problem that 's difficult to work around . 
  arguably , the politicised nature of this survey will reduce the degree to which non-response bias is an issue in comparison to if a survey on the same scale were being conducted for purely statistical purposes . 
  the potential for political change acts as an incentive much like research studies often use monetary payment as incentive to participate . 
  who 's `` he '' ? 
  if we 're talking about beethoven 's symphony no. 5 , the first movement is very definitely in c minor , and it 's written with a c minor key signature . 
  the movement modulates into c major during the recapitulation for the b theme , but only briefly , before it ends strongly in c minor . 
  and obviously the fourth movement of the symphony is in c major . 
  but each movement has its own key signature . 
  c minor for the allegro con brio , f minor for the andante con moto , c minor again for the scherzo ( but c major during the trio ) , and then c major for the final allegro . 
   i assume they 're not going to mail these survey forms overseas - people abroad are entitled to vote but this is n't an election so, 
  yeah this is an interesting question , and one i wish i knew the answer to . 
  my parents are overseas , but they 've been off the electoral roll since they moved , so i ca n't find out from them . 
  they tried to re-enroll for this survey , but ca n't enroll online , and they only found out about that too late to do it at a consulate . 
  you could try the built-in customer support in the pixel . 
  i 've used it once and they were really quite helpful . 
  it 's political strategy . 
  a conscience vote is one where the party whips do n't try to force you to vote one way or the other . 
  members in australia are much , much more likely to vote along their party lines than congresspeople are in america . 
  we do sometimes have crossing the floor , but it 's not common . 
  it 's much more rare among labor than among the liberal/national coalition , because labor party members are bound by party rules to vote the way the party determines . 
  a conscience vote occurs when a party decides not to have an official opinion , and every mp votes purely according to their own wishes ( be it their personal opinion or the opinion of their electorate ) . 
  much like the existence of parties in the first place , it 's just a matter of convention that kinda naturally arises out of the structures of government . 
  good bot, 
  wow . 
  i was all ready to call you out on the difference between a majority and a plurality . 
  but nope . 
  chrome literally does have a majority share of both the total browser market and the desktop computer market . 
  that 's definitely short tho, 
  wellington 's victory is n't a symphony . 
  it 's more similar to an overture , really . 
  [ beethoven 's symphony no. 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgeij44k3oo ) ushered in the romantic era , both for its bold harmonies and its political context . 
  [ his symphony no. 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z4kk7rwjmk ) uses one of the most famous motifs in all of music . 
  the first movement is perhaps one of the most perfect example of sonata form in action . 
  the transition from 3rd to 4th movement is absolutely spine-chilling . 
  the 4th movement is also the earliest widely-performed piece to include piccolo and trombone . 
  [ the 6th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqea4qup-dy ) , which it may interest you to learn actually premiered * before * the 5th ( albeit at the same concert ) is one of the most beautiful depictions of the countryside there is . 
  there 's not a lot interesting to be said about [ the 7th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4788tmz9zo ) , except that it is utterly amazing . 
  [ the 9th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217h8jppi ) might just be the greatest piece of music ever created . 
  every single moment of it , from the mysterious quiet , building opening which almost resembles an orchestra tuning , all the way to the glorious celebratory ode to joy , is utter musical perfection . 
  [ the emperor concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxwk3w477w ) is his best and most famous , though i have to admit i 'm not personally as big a fan of his concerti as i am his sonati and symphonies . 
  of the sonatas , my favourites are [ no . 
  8 `` path\u00e9tique '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcockyqx3c&amp;t=135s ) , [ no . 
  14 `` moonlight '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4n8vqlx_o ) ( the first movement of which is usually performed much too slowly , and takes on an amazing otherworldly quality when performed at the correct tempo , the last movement of which is an amazing whirlwind of sound ) , [ no . 
  23 `` appassionata '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c3tir2bbo0 ) ( which has a brilliant use of a very similar motif to the 5th symphony ) , and [ no . 
  29 `` hammerklavier '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwzsdzgy1xa ) ( considered almost unplayable when first released , and still today one of the hardest pieces in the repertoire ) . 
  for all the sonatas , i would highly recommend listening to [ andras schiff 's lectures ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/music/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) about them , as they provide some excellent insight into the pieces . 
  i must confess myself not much of a fan of beethoven 's quartets , so i 'll leave those recommendations to others . 
  for mozart , my preference leans towards his later works . 
  his [ clarinet concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3ejqvkhyzy ) is one of the greatest solo works for the instrument ( also really good is his earlier [ clarinet quintet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdnqcgcapt4 ) ) ; it 's also the last orchestral piece he completed . 
  [ mozart 's requiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=splhkp0nzii ) is absolutely chilling , right from the very beginning . 
  the introitus and lacrimosa are my favourite sections , and the dies ir\u00e6 is obviously one of the most famous parts , but the whole thing is great . 
  [ his 40th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtc1mdieqi8 ) is one of the most famous pieces in existence ( or at least , its opening is ) for being `` generic classical music '' . 
  but it is very good , and became famous for a reason . 
  much better though , in my opinion , is [ his 41st symphony `` jupiter '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnk3kh8zega ) , which was one of the set pieces i had to study in high school music . 
  the fugue in the 4th movement might be second only to beethoven 's der gro\u00dfe for the best post-bach fugue . 
  i 'm also a big fan of his horn concerti , though i ca n't give you a particular one to listen to . 
  i 've always kinda wanted to get in to shostakovich more . 
   loughborough , which , after a pause , an american pronounced looga burooga, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's the orcish name for barad-d\u00fbr ... 
  anyway , how * is * it pronounced ? 
  is it just low-burrow ? 
  yeah i thought that super odd . 
  it 's even worse though ,, 
   they span from [ japanese animated tv ] to [ japanese card game based on a japanese animated tv show ], 
  bad bot, 
  the winter games , surely ? 
  but thanks . 
  that explanation helped a lot . 
  haha yup .

  yeah they 've gone back to all of the old ones . 
  which is mostly a good thing , but the new cheddar ones were so much better than the old ones , so i was a bit sad when they went back with those ones . 
  they kept the new cheddar for months after the rest of the flavours had gone back , so i had hoped that they 'd * stay * with the new ones . 
  but then a few months back they stopped appearing on shelves :(,
