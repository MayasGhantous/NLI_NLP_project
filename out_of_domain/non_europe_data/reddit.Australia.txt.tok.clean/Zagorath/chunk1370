   a lot of people will probably vote yes just because they resent having $ 122 million needlessly wasted, 
  i 've heard far more people who are going to not vote at all -- people who * do support * marriage equality -- for this reason . 
  i 've even heard a few marriage equality supporters who will vote * no * because of it . 
  good bot, 
  damn . 
  you 've got way more books in 9 months than i have in 32 . 
  is it a preroll video ad or some other type ? 
  if it 's preroll video , clicking on it should take you to a standard watch page where you can link it to us . 
  but to your question , i signed up for red a couple of weeks ago . 
  seeing zero ads is great !, 
  / r/nothingeverhappens, 
  bootcamp is great . 
  most games worth playing come out on macos these days anyway . 
  well they backed down on the design of the mac pro . 
  i 'm pretty sure they said on macbreak weekly last week that the coverage would be leo and alex lindsay . 
  python is a very common language for new comers . 
  it 's almost designed to be the perfect introductory language . 
  and yet it never receives even a fraction of the criticism js does . 
  i think most of the js criticism * is * because js is bad . 
  because it 's bad and * also * popular . 
   if you 're comparing what you can do with a gaming laptop to a mac , there 's literally no comparison, 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is you * can * do some gaming on it , if that 's something you want to be able to do . 
  it 's not going to be * as * good at gaming , but that 's often a worthwhile tradeoff for being better at just about everything else . 
   basically nothing comes out on macos, 
  hey , i noticed you 've skipped a decade . 
  welcome to 2017 . 
  we have steam on macos now , and most new titles come out on at least mac and windows , if not also linux . 
  i would personally say they could do that * if * their past life was a blacksmith 's assistant or similar . 
  that 's a complicated rule interaction that i think you would have to ask jeremy crawford for an answer to . 
  it could go one way or the other , imo . 
  but i would personally rule that yes , you take one quarter damage in that case . 
  \\ #notallbirds, 
  ( #butthesebirds ), 
  from an epistemological perspective , the one making the positive claim should usually be the one to provide evidence . 
  is there evidence that there * were * kookaburra chicks ? 
   ruled public domain, 
  not technically . 
  it was ruled to * not * belong to warner/chappell , but the court did n't rule out it potentially belonging to someone else who might come in and stake a claim . 
  for all practical purposes though , yeah , it 's now pd . 
  if someone thought they had a legitimate claim , i reckon they probably would . 
  thankfully , it 's honestly very unlikely anyone would have a good claim . 
  warner/chappell 's claim was probably the strongest one out there , and the courts decided it was n't good enough . 
  yes . 
  people most often seem to talk about twinning spells with regards to damage-dealing spells , but if you listen to crawford talk about the option ( it was in one of the official d&d podcasts , i do n't remember which ) , it 's clear that the intended use is more for cases like this . 
   there are multiple videos of the kookaburra burrow in a tree, 
  cool , thanks for answering the question . 
   plus , the comment you were responded was making exactly your point ; it was saying that the original person who claimed the kookaburra was there only to get food had no proof . 
  good going on that one . 
  yeah fuck off mate . 
  first of all , you 're analysing the situation rather poorly ; it was quite clearly making the assumption that there were birds nesting there ( a positive claim ) , but presented no evidence , and instead tried to shift the burden of proof to the person making the negative claim . 
  but secondly , and more importantly , that accusatory tone was completely unwarranted . 
  i have no stake in the substance of this debate , and i never at any point implied my position one way or the other ( if you 're interested , i 'm actually more inclined to agree with op on this one ) . 
  but op 's argument structure was flawed , and that needed to be pointed out . 
  so , you 're pointing to a bunch of proposals & mdash ; none of which , by the way , is from the australian greens ' official policy , or even the queensland greens , which might to some extent have been relevant in this subreddit & mdash ; to nationalise significant public infrastructure . 
  things which are quite widely believed to be sound economic decisions . 
  the one arguable exception to that would be re-nationalising the commonwealth bank , which is kinda a special case since it did in fact used to be ( until * very * recently , in fact ) publicly owned . 
  and there are good arguments in both directions as far as the economic benefits/costs associated with nationally owned financial institutions . 
  did you ever watch the lion king as a kid ? 
  or with your kids , if you 're older ? 
  it 's the circle of life mate . 
  animals eat other animals . 
  besides , if a kookaburra does it to some dumb introduced species , who cares ? 
  they usually do more harm than good to the ecosystem anyway . 
  ( also if it does it to magpies , because fuck magpies . ), 
  does aom get hate ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the second most popular game in the franchise , and it 's a ** lot ** of people 's favourite . 
  age 3 definitely gets more hate than it deserves though . 
   may you build an empire to stand the test of time !, 
  that 's civ 's line !, 
  i played age 1 recently , and to be honest even though it was probably my earliest exposure to pc gaming and i played it and loved it for years as a kid , i * did n't * think it held up . 
  i thought it was near unplayable . 
  but anyway age 1 definitive edition is coming out in a little over a month 's time . 
  i do n't know about you , but i am ** super ** hyped . 
  by all accounts , it 's a much more substantial remaster than the age 2 hd or aom ee were , and it 's being made by a much less incompetent team , so here 's hoping it 's good . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's okay for me to say this , but i just got my invite to the de beta , and am downloading it at the moment . 
  ca n't wait to see what it 's like . 
  i had a unit queue . 
  there may or may not have been an idle villagers button , but i do n't remember . 
  pathfinding was abysmal though , and graphics were shit , so i do n't think i had the userpatch . 
  irrelevant, 
  which judgement is this ? 
  what 's that weird eldritch horror staring at you ? 
  i guess it 's like kalamundalad said further down the thread, 
   unless you appear in that court regularly enough to be recognised as a competent operator, 
  i 'm no expert , but i think a judge may qualify . 
  ah thanks , that explains it . 
  i use lastpass , which hijacks some accessibility features . 
  just one more reason to consider lastpass , perhaps ? 
  hey , do you happen to know why it would he that , even after following those instructions , every time the pi gets restarted , i lose wifi and have to redo it ? 
  not sure if * chill touch * is a great choice , seeing as it 's not a wintery spell . 
  but the concept is brilliant !, 
   hey guys you know what , let 's not be sad that jim died , let 's have a big ol' feast ~ ~ because i ca n't stand to be without my creature comforts ~ ~ in his honour !!, 
  just because you 're forced to express more upbeat emotions does n't mean you ca n't channel it in a respectful way . 
  ah , so it is . 
  that seems an odd choice on wizards ' part , then . 
  i vaguely remember that . 
  mostly i remember not understanding it at the time either . 
  i think there 's a fairly recent / r/wdp post about that show , explaining why some people seem to like it so much . 
  go home richard , you 're drunk .
