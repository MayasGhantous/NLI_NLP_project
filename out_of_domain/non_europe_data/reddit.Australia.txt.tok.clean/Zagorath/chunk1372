  why would a fictional viking accuse you of lying about being an astronaut ? 
  easy , do n't use any colour . 
  just carve it into the door . 
  damn , i do n't know which is worse . 
  america 's relationship with debt , or with healthcare . 
   for an entity like the un to work at all would require universal membership, 
  why would it ? 
  there are countries in our world that are n't un members and it works just fine . 
  some are undeniably independent states not allowed in for political reasons , like taiwan and kosovo . 
  others are not permitted because of their size , like the holy see . 
  and some are much more controversial but would likely , in an independent unbiased assessment , be considered independent nations , like palestine . 
  then there are places that call themselves countries but by no reasonable definition could be given that title , such as the constituent nations of the united kingdom . 
  un membership is by no means universal on earth . 
  but more importantly , why exactly would universal membership be * required * for it to function ? 
  there 's absolutely no quality of the federation that would require it work in that manner . 
  if you prefer the analogy , it could be like the eu , which structurally is basically the same thing . 
  a non-sovereign organisation overseeing aspects of a large number of independent states . 
  i do n't know which flag is which , but of the b tier ones , i 'd say the fourth is by far the best , and deserves to go up . 
  the first is almost good , but i feel its choice of colours is really poor ; the stat does n't stand out enough . 
  similarly with the one with the union jack in its canton : the colours are just too striking . 
  the second one is the worst though , because it looks almost like they 've decided to put a letter on there , and writing is an automatic fail . 
  why is a simple red st. andrew 's cross on white given c tier ? 
  that 's b tier at least for simplicity and recognisability , even if significance might hold it down from a or s tier . 
  also how is california in the same tier ? 
  too much detail in the bear , and * writing * for god 's sake . 
  ** writing ** . 
  f at best . 
  this is * not * all my opinion . 
  one paragraph of it was maybe mildly debatable at best . 
  the rest was entirely objective . 
  smoking has a * necessary * effect on the surroundings . 
  alcohol only has the potential to do it if misused . 
  i 'm an android user and have no interest in switching any time soon ( i am as much a google fanboy as the stereotypical apple fanboy is to apple ) , but what they showed with that ar thing was ** massive ** . 
  that 's stuff that just a few years ago would have required multi-thousand dollar investments in specialised hardware and software , and people with advanced technical knowledge in how to use it . 
  and now it can be done on a mobile phone with zero technical knowledge , all in real time . 
  that 's amazing !, 
  hopefully that tech will spread pretty quickly , because the implications of it are * enormous * . 
  low budget filmmaking could do wondrous things with it . 
  and it could be awesome see it employed through a hololens-like glasses for the purpose of roleplaying games . 
  whether your party is with you in the same room , or being imposed into the room when they 're far away , being able to actually look like your character to the other players , could be awesome fun . 
  the tech will need to be made available to other companies before it can go very far though . 
  it 's some awesome tech , it 's almost a shame that all its being used for is animated emojis in chat rooms . 
  bad mechanics are objectively bad . 
  you can not defend the game 's poor ladders , platforming , and box moving mechanics . 
  they are just bad . 
  you tried to claim , in two consecutive comments , that i was arguing about subjective things . 
  and i did a little of that . 
  but most of my comment concentrated on objective flaws in the game . 
  your deliberate misrepresentation of my argument is the reason i downvoted , not merely out of disagreement . 
  spyro came out in the same year , and was an excellent 3d platformer with none of the problems half life had . 
  and even if that were n't the case , being not shit for its time does n't make a game gold up well today . 
  this . 
  my sister campaigned very heavily at our school after she was made head girl to get them to allow girls to wear trousers . 
  she always wore her pe shorts under her skirt for exactly this reason . 
  did n't help that the skirts were designed terribly and were insanely short ... 
  they finally started allowing it this school year i think , and only for people in their final two years . 
  i think they 're planning on rolling it out to younger students over time . 
  not sure what the go is on shorts . 
  boys are n't allowed shorts in their final 4 years . 
  is this the one at the end of noble street ? 
  i dunno , there 's something amusing about the * permanence * of carving genitals into the door . 
  that the republic of china ( taiwan ) is not in the un is a massive obvious flaw . 
  it ** is ** * unambiguously * a country by any reasonable measure , and the fact that many countries do not officially recognise it says more about international politicking and the unreasonableness of the regime of the people 's republic of china 's than anything else . 
  kosovo was another country i mentioned in my previous comment . 
  it is a sovereign nation recognised by 111 un states . 
  it is very notable that on the list of countries which do * not * recognise kosovo are countries such as china and spain , which each have substantial problems with independence movements within their borders . 
  and there are other examples ; these are just the most obvious and least defensible . 
  but anyway , it 's not particularly important , because as we both agree , it does n't have any real bearing on the answer to the initial proposal . 
  i like it , a lot . 
  in fact , if you 'd like , i 'd absolutely love to do some photoshop work on that image to give you the ripping and blotching effects to have the image bleed into the page , to make it look quite a lot higher quality . 
  in terms of balance , i 'd say frost walk is worth about 1 , coming from 0.25 from ignoring icy difficult terrain , and 0.75 for walking on water , and cold hands is worth 1 . 
  that makes the total subrace worth 3.75 , on the detect balance scale , which makes a genasi using this subrace worth a total of 5.75 . 
  so it 's right in the sweet spot for balance . 
  lol , love the disclaimer, 
  so , by my understanding , the `` sylvan born '' are basically meant to be to the fey what tieflings are to fiends ? 
  you may want to either change the origin of your shades , or else give them a different name . 
  because [ shades are a thing that exist in d&d ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/shade ) , and they have an origin loosely related to the shadowfell . 
  nothing at all to do with the abyss . 
  til there 's another season of onfltp . 
  damn , that 's unfortunate . 
  not sure i buy the explanation as to * why * it 's not possible . 
  step 3 's `` execute actions '' could easily include `` check comment.parent '' , just like it can already do things with the parent * submission * . 
  still , thanks for the simple answer . 
  mailing began on the 12th , and all forms should be received by monday the 25th september . 
  friday , 20 october is the final day you can request or pick up a replacement , if you have n't gotten one by the 25th september . 
  forms must be ** received ** by the abs by 7 november , so make sure you have mailed it by 27 october to ensure it gets delivered .

  for some reason tpb has been coming in and out the last few weeks , using google dns . 
  like , one day i 'll be redirected to my isp 's `` oy , stop that '' page , and the next day it 'll work just fine . 
  i have no idea why . 
  but uk coins are n't round ? 
   unless you 're into a religion that prohibits eating certain foods ... everything is permitted . 
  wait , was assassin 's creed talking about religion ? 
  nothing is true ... 
  oh that 's good . 
  even for charity , i thought $ 10 for a single playable race was a stupidly steep price . 
  but with all that extra stuff , it 's quite reasonable . 
  i use the [ detect balance ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) system , but i use it in its original form , where +1 asi is equal to 1.0 . 
  this makes the values easier to intuit and understand , as well as making judging the relative strength of individual features simpler . 
  just divide the values in the spreadsheet by 4 .
