  here 's the photoshopped version . 
  i could n't decide which i liked more , so there are two copies :, 
  paging / u/the-magic-sword, 
  i just noticed i forgot to reset the opacity on the main layer !, 
  it makes the whole thing , but especially the leg and the stains near the leg , look really strange . 
  unfortunately i 've just rebooted into my windows partition which does n't have photoshop installed on it , so i ca n't fix it right now , but i 'll do it later tonight or tomorrow . 
  4 hours `` adjust opacity on ice genasi '', 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but i think the cause and effect is the wrong way around . 
  stuff with attractive women , especially in the thumbnail , is more likely to be looked at , which means it 's more likely to be upvoted , which means more people see it , which means more people upvote it . 
  i do n't think creators are doing it consciously to garner votes , let alone creating whole bits of content to justify sharing the pics , but creators have the same internal biases as viewers , which means they 're more likely to * enjoy * using these sorts of photos . 
  you guys do n't get exam leave during and just before the exams start ? 
  sorry , but this submission is not complete to a degree that this subreddit can accept . 
  we do not require that content be polished and perfectly balanced , but we do require that content appear fleshed out and immediately usable . 
  as this is an unfinished piece of homebrew , i am removing it . 
  please comment on the arcana forge megathread at the top of the sub to get help finishing this off , so that it is ready for critique and balancing on the main part of the subreddit . 
  i hope you find answers in the arcana forge . 
  best of luck , and happy homebrewing !, 
  hey , that 's up to you if you want to . 
  you do n't have to , but i 'd certainly be very appreciative if you did !, 
  regarding the opacity thing , i just checked , and it turns out i had it right the first time . 
  the image just looks a little strange down by the leg naturally . 
  you might be able to get it looking a little better if you adjust it so the image appears * above * the horizontal line at the bottom . 
  unfortunately because of how the css is set up , that requires setting the image 's z value to like 101 , which means it will also be above the text and the sidebar . 
  you can overcome this by adding :, 
  . phb : : after {, 
  z-index : -2 ;, 
  into the document , right * before * the line that says ` < / style  `, 
  this is a problem with the current implementation of homebrewery that i 've just noticed and discovered a simple workaround for . 
  [ issue also opened on github ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues/491 ) . 
  the one with the leg pointing to the left should already be edited with that . 
  or just make some toast and leave it on a little too long . 
   yet, 
   religious celebrants will not have to participate , but wedding planners , florists , function center owners , cake makers , car hire owners and drivers etc will be compelled to participate or face legal consequences . 
  it 's funny , but one of the reasons i wish this survey was being boycotted is precisely because i expect the lnp ** will ** provide exemptions for these sorts of businesses . 
  and they absolutely * should not do that * . 
  we are not a society that tolerates discrimination . 
  or at least , we should aspire to be one . 
  how would you feel if a florist etc. 
  was allowed to deny you service because you 're italian , or because you 're a white person marrying an asian , or because you 're a divorcee getting remarried ? 
  why should same sex marriages be any different ? 
  bad bot, 
  an argument from tradition is not a good argument . 
  it is , in fact , a logical fallacy , which means the argument can be completely dismissed in rational debate . 
  there are many things that have `` always been this way '' which society has , at some point , recognised were a bad idea and progressed . 
  women were at one poijt expected not to work . 
  or earlier than that , were not allowed to vote . 
  at one point in history owning slaves was considered a normal and acceptable part of society 's functioning . 
  it was once considered acceptable to murder people for doing things against your preferred religion . 
  in 50 years , people will look back on the idea that people of the same sex could not get married with much the same derision as we do these ideas today . 
  because society improves itself . 
  and arguing that we should n't do something today because we never have done it in the past is not an argument . 
  it 's an excuse . 
  the deafening silence on this issue is infuriating . 
  half of the reports i 've gotten since that change have been miscategorised or invalid . 
  before , incorrect reports were rare . 
  why on earth they deliberately made the interface worse is beyond me . 
  i would counter that your counter is utter bullshit and not worthy of discussion . 
  you dropped this :, 
  [ here you go mate . 
  ] ( https://www.business.gov.au/info/plan-and-start/start-your-business/what-is-customer-service/refusing-service ), 
  it also [ does seem to be true in canada ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/british-columbia/gay-couple-discriminated-against-b-c-tribunal-rules-1.1258234 ) . 
  edit : wait , i misread the context . 
  this answers a different question . 
  this is an interesting case actually . 
  what if someone refused service to a same sex couple on the grounds that the same sex couple * holds the political opinion * that same sex marriages are okay ? 
  hey mate , just in case you were n't aware , this photo seems to show us where you live and work . 
   is my driving school the name of the school ? 
  lol , [ apparently so ] ( https://www.mydrivingschool.com.au/ ) . 
  hey mate , [ here 's a recent thread about the same thing ] ( / r/brisbane/comments / 6yd24b/looking _ for_decent_driving_schools / ) with a bunch more answers . 
  hopefully that helps . 
   any other gay is here ? 
  it kinda makes sense , in an `` english as a second language '' kinda way . 
  yeah probably, 
  yup . 
  i 'm not particularly opposed to enforcing the speed limit , but i do feel there are other rules that would be * more * worth spending time on . 
  dangerous swerving in and out of traffic ; using your phone while driving ; and not indicating for sufficient time before changing lanes or turning , particularly at roundabouts ; all road rules that i see broken * constantly * and endanger others more than going 5 over the limit at the bottom of a hill . 
  pfft , you 're obviously lying to us . 
  only cyclists run red lights . 
  i mean , it was 9 days ago . 
  that 's further back than most people would reasonably look :p, 
  plus reddit 's search is ... not great . 
   i do know however not to post asking what 's a good first car to buy . 
  nah mate i say go for it . 
  it 's become a meme by this point . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  hey guys , does anyone know if you can just rock up to msy and order from the counter ? 
  in the past i 've always ordered online for pickup in store , or had it delivered . 
  i did that this time too . 
  put in an order last * saturday * for pick up in store . 
  but it 's now a full week later and still no information . 
  so i 'd like to just go in and ask for the things . 
  anyone know if they do that ? 
  lol stupid winter . 
  you 're two weeks too late . 
  could n't get your shit together when it was actually your time to shine , get out of spring 's way . 
  cool , good to know . 
  thanks .
