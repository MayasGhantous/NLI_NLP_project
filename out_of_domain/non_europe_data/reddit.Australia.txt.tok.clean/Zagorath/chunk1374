  but how does this change possibly help them with that ? 
  all it does is frustrate users , with reporting bad content being more difficult , and mods , with the resulting bad reports . 
  this is utterly illegible . 
  why have you inserted so many column breaks all over the place ? 
  you also have credited your image . 
  i 'll have to ask you to edit in a citation within a reasonable timeframe , or the post will be removed . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  sorry , but your work contains art assets or other content that is not properly credited and ** will be removed ** if they are not added in a reasonable timeframe . 
  note that it has not been removed yet and it is still visible . 
  it only * will be * removed if action is not taken swiftly . 
  please review your work and apply proper credit for sources . 
  if the issue is art assets , please look at the following guide :, 
  for finding art that can be used freely used ; if you are unable to find a source to credit . 
  sometimes it is not completely clear that assets are being used uncredited , and homebrews will slip through the cracks . 
  fret not and please do not feel singled out . 
  if your homebrew is removed , you are welcome to repost it once the proper credits have been established . 
  also , i 've reflaired this `` mechanic '' for you .

  like all the major cities in my country , it 's named after some old british dude . 
  the country is basically just called `` south land '' . 
  not to be confused with `` east land '' , which is just two letters away from having the same name . 
  no problem . 
  just so you know , options 2 and 3 work on * this * subreddit , but will not necessarily work everywhere . 
  option 1 works site-wide , however . 
  requiring flair is also not a site-wide thing , it 's something that we require on / r/unearthedarcana for the purposes of easy search and categorisation . 
  how would you get that ? 
  according to wikipedia , paraguay gets its name from something to do with rivers or the sea . 
  australia . 
  good bot, 
  this is, 
  a ) the law in most places, 
  b ) common bloody sense, 
  while we 're at it , turn on your lights even during the day , and regardless of how bright it is , if it 's raining . 
  this is why i use adblock plus , and have `` allow some non-intrusive advertising '' turned on . 
  i 'm more than willing to allow ads to show , but i just got sick of all the video and audio ads . 
  if your site is willing to respect me by only showing unobtrusive ads , then i 'm willing to respect you . 
  which ad ? 
  i tuned out . 
  seriously , neither team has a chance . 
  the winner tonight goes against the storm . 
  this is effectively a game for third place . 
  note , they need to ** receive ** it by then . 
  they recommend sending it in no later than 27 october . 
  seriously . 
  people who vote no for that reason are fucking scum . 
  i have way less respect for people who vote no `` to stick it to the lefties '' than i do for those who legitimately believe marriage should be between a man and a woman . 
  if you are petty enough to make up your mind on * any * issue just to stick it to someone , that 's just about the lowest a person can possibly be . 
  sorry this is really late , but what was that 20 & nbsp ; m kickout before for ? 
  edit : holy shit rip my inbox . 
  thanks everyone !, 
  so is it every attempt on goal after a penalty , or are there only certain specific circumstances that lead to a 20 & nbsp ; m dropout ? 
  'cause i could have sworn it 'd be more common to see one if it 's every penalty goal ... 
   sorry it 's my first time on homebrewery how do i fix format ? 
  well , for starters , you 've inserted column breaks * all over the place * . 
  this is a column break :, 
  and it does what the name says . 
  it makes any text below that on the next column across . 
  which , if it 's already in the second column , means it tries to force it across into the `` third '' column , which is mostly invisible . 
  and if it 's already in the third column , it goes into the fourth , which is entirely invisible . 
  and so on . 
  i 'm not really sure why you 've used so many column breaks all over the place , or what your intent was . 
  but the result is a completely and utterly illegible document . 
  i 've only ever seen it as gsm , but yeah , it 's unfortunately quite rare . 
  i always use it though , because as this thread demonstrates , trying to list each different group results in an utterly ridiculous initialism . 
   maybe if bus drivers want more money they should stop paying the rtbu $ 600 + per year for doing nothing !, 
  or maybe fewer of them should be fucking scabs , so the industrial action could have actually had some proper fucking effect . 
  seriously , how can you expect serious change when a full * half * of your workforce decides to say `` fuck everyone else 's long term prospects , i 'm doing what 's best for * me * right now '' . 
  and if the council is annoyed at lost funds , maybe they should have been more willing to reach a reasonable bargain in the early stages of this process instead of waiting for months of industrial action . 
  this anti-union trend is honestly disgusting . 
  it 's amazing how effective the attack campaigns by the right-wing media and political parties have been , that even many common people have such intensely negative opinions of unions . 
  unions , the organisations which literally serve no purpose other than to * stand up for the common people * . 
  you have to wonder how much more effective the action might have been if most people using buses were actually affected by this , either by being given free rides , or by buses not turning up at all . 
  i do n't know about most people , but the only time i ever even * noticed * that there was any industrial action going on was on the one time i went on a bus a long way outside of my normal most common routes . 
  i never had a bus not turn up , and i only had one free fair in the entire time . 
  how can you possibly have effective industrial action when half the workforce are scabs, 
   i thought you meant there was another country whose name translates to ` east land ', 
  there is !, 
  that 's what austria means !, 
  that 's what i was referring to . 
  the fact that it 's name is very similar , and also its meaning is quite similar , but is east , not south . 
   suncorp,
