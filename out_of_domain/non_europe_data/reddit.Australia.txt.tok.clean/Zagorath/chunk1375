  come on mate . 
  you 're not a commercial entity . 
  you can call it by its proper name . 
  you say that as though the storm would n't murder us if everyone were healthy . 
   i used a magic marker and wrote on the chips 1st , 2nd , 3rd . . etc, 
  why not just use different value chips for different level spells ? 
  white or blue , 1st level ; red , 2nd level ; green , 3rd level ; etc. 
  i forget , does commander 's strike require the use of a reaction ? 
  because if so , i might personally rule that a caster with the war caster feat can cast a spell just as if it were an opportunity attack . 
  this is one case where i really wish strawpoll did n't automatically rearrange the options into order of popularity . 
  would be interesting to visually see the curve of results . 
  so the little `` home '' and `` work '' icons , which seem to be around highgate hill and south brisbane ( or possibly milton ) , if i 'm reading the map correctly ? 
  wow , in 4 months google has n't already automatically updated it for you ? 
  when i stay with my parents for two months over the holiday it automatically updates for me ... 
  but anyway , i just wanted to make sure you were aware and were n't accidentally sharing information you did n't want to . 
  if you do n't care , then neither do i !, 
   each players could only bring one book and those were the books we use to build characters, 
  that 's a very interesting rule set , to be honest . 
  not for 5e , not yet ( there is n't enough material out there for it to be a problem ) , but for a game as bloated as 3 . x or 4e , it would be an interesting way to limit the cheese , without going * so * extreme like the ridiculous adventurer 's league rules . 
  i was just assuming they had a standard set of poker chips , which come in multiple colours , usually representing different dollar values . 
  in terms of remembering the colours , you could use the standard poker rules ( which my previous comment assumed ) if you know what they are . 
  if not , there are a number of easy ways you could do it . 
  follow rainbow order ( roy g biv ) plus white and black at the end , put it in order of your own favourite to least favourite , do it in alphabetical order of chip colour , etc. 
  it 's not really that much of a problem . 
  aside from simply rearranging them so that they 're visually in order from 1 to 5 , the next best thing you could do would be to count them out as if they were an instant runoff vote . 
  just assume everyone 's preference order moves toward the centre . 
  for example , currently `` against '' is in last place , so eliminate it and redistribute its votes to `` dislike '' . 
  next , eliminate `` crucial '' and redistribute to `` preferred '' . 
  as it stands right now , that would mean `` preferred '' gets a majority and wins . 
  not a statistical analysis , but an interesting quasi-political one . 
  their rule currently is that each player can only use the phb and * one * other book . 
  ( they 're actually way more limiting than even that , in terms of some races being outright banned , which alignments you can be , and forcing you to join certain factions . 
  a heap of bullshit . 
  but that 's a separate issue ... ), 
  good bot, 
  but would be even better if you simply stated what time the thing actually happens in utc . 
  everyone can easily work out their own time zone from there . 
  it 's actually a really interesting little problem in computer science . 
  it 's called [ `` levenshtein distance '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/levenshtein_distance ) . 
  you can add , remove , or swap a letter . 
  to borrow the example from the wikipedia article :, 
   for example , the levenshtein distance between `` kitten '' and `` sitting '' is 3 , since the following three edits change one into the other , and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits :, 
   1 . kitten \u2192 sitten ( substitution of `` s '' for `` k '' ), 
   2 . sitten \u2192 sittin ( substitution of `` i '' for `` e '' ), 
   3 . sittin \u2192 sitting ( insertion of `` g '' at the end ) .

  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' .

  you rock !, 
  i was actually talking to the bot there , but yeah , when sharing times online it 's * always * best if you do so in utc , just to make things convenient for everyone . 
  damn that 's an * expensive * cost . 
  i * definitely * think i 'd be willing to allow war casters to cast single-target spells , given how much is being given up . 
  hey , this is being removed because you did not edit in credit for the artist in a reasonable amount of time . 
  feel free to resubmit it at a later date if you have edited in the credit . 
  i might also suggest you fix up your formatting first . 
  people are unlikely to upvote it if it takes a lot of effort on their part to read it , and if they do n't upvote it , even fewer people will see it .

  it might also be a good idea to fix up the formatting a little before you do . 
  there 's one section where things are disappearing off into the third column . 
  yeah with a rogue it definitely becomes quite useful . 
  i think to a lesser extent it could also be useful if you 're a sword-and-boarder and someone in your party is a greatweapon user , especially a raging barbarian . 
  their 1d12 +2 is worth a heap more than your 1d8 , even if it 's not as good as a rogue 's 3 or 4d6 , or 1d8 +2 or 3d6 . 
  i do n't know about most people , but i 've never seen spells higher than 6th level , and 90 % of my play has not seen spells higher than 4th . 
  that changes the dynamic * significantly * compared to your theoretical 9 spell colours .

  i 've never been able to play any game mode really . 
  m&b is just unplayably laggy for me whenever i try . 
  yeah that 's why i 'm not gon na sign up . 
  i get more email than i want already , so between reddit and youtube i figure i 'll be fine without signing up for this , even if it is a good idea to have it available for those who want . 
  i think the `` block this user '' option , at least when reporting * comments * , is an option that makes a lot of sense . 
  most users are n't aware that blocking users is even an option , let alone where to find it . 
  presenting it to them right there , after they 've already indicated that the user is someone who makes comments they do n't want to see ( especially if reported for spam or abuse-related reasons ) makes a lot of sense . 
  an unsub from the subreddit option , however , makes a lot less sense to me . 
   it breaks reddit 's rules ( next goes to spam/abuse/private / copyright/trademark choices in a single panel ), 
  or , even better , a simple drop-down menu , defaulting to spam ( since spam is by far the most common concern ) that lets you select one of the reddit rules that has been broken , without needing to go to an entire new page .
