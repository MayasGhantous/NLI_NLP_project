  plus the sub rules below that . 
  you ca n't play an aarakocra at all , but you * can * play the various monstrous races from volo 's --, 
  despite the latter being clearly designed * not * to be balanced against standard player races . 
  plus limitations on alignment , requirements to join specific organisations , being required to choose your stats in a way that * is n't * the default recommended method from the phb , plus probably some other points that i 'm forgetting about right now . 
  but by far the most insidious is the phb +1 rule . 
  all those examples you listed are very good ones , but it gets worse than that . 
  it means that if you choose to play something from somewhere * other * than the phb , you are getting screwed over because there can never be additional content to support you . 
  a patron from the phb might get new patron-exclusive pacts or invocations . 
  but the poor undying warlock gets fucked over by it , because they ca n't use anything . 
  even worse than that , though , is that wizards seems to be designing * the rest of the game * according to the al 's ridiculous rules . 
  that means not only do al undying warlocks get screwed over , but ** anyone ** who wants to play an undying warlock , even in a proper home game , is being unfairly neutered . 
  the undying warlock is just one specific example , but literally every time they release new content outside the phb , users of that content are liable to be treated as second class citizens under the adventurer 's league 's regime . 
  bad bot, 
  does this mean i can be a patron if i self-identify as an apache attack helicopter ? 
  does this mean i can bring new sorcerers into existence if i self-identify as an apache attack helicopter ? 
  or , as steven fry teaches :, 
  [ i before e , except after c ; except most of the time . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duqlzxiizqa ), 
  i have the opposite problem . 
  all i can * find * is flexible wax , when what i want is frangible wax . 
   keeping the seal intact, 
  that 's actually exactly why i * want * frangible wax . 
  the seal itself breaking makes it feel somehow more authentic . 
  like the seal is actually * sealing * the paper , and breaking it is the same as breaking the plastic seal on products ( such as medicines ) you might buy today : a clear and irreversible indication that this has been opened . 
  the specifics of the law probably vary from place to place . 
  but in my state , going straight on you are allowed to be in either lane . 
  turning right or doing a u-turn you must be in the right ( inner ) lane . 
  turning left you must be in the left lane . 
  the exception is if it is signed otherwise . 
  for example many roundabouts have signs and road markings indicating that those going straight * must * be in one particular lane . 
   yeah , that 's essentially the old report interface, 
  oh , is it ? 
  what a complete happy coincidence !, 
  bad bot, 
  there is n't a lot of narrative aussie tv that i like . 
  my favourite show is without a doubt gruen . 
  but i also really enjoy the checkout ( if you can get past the cringe , the actual information is really useful ) and media watch . 
  i 'm a sucker for quiz shows , and at the moment my favourite is hard quiz . 
  for narrative stuff , i really enjoyed glitch when i watched it last year and i think season 2 is coming soon . 
  beetroot full stop is degenerate . 
  is it unaustralian of me to say that ? 
  probably ; i do n't care . 
  * 2 levels in rogue for bonus action dash . 
  you can also get expertise in whatever skills you think might be useful . 
  * be an elf for the 35 ft. movement speed . 
  * 5 levels wizard to get * haste * and * longstrider * +10 ft. movement and an extra dash action, 
  * 3 levels barb for elk totem +15 ft. movement, 
  * the `` mobile '' feat for +10 ft. movement ( taken at wizard level 4 ), 
  that gets you a total movement speed of 70 ft. , and lets you move once as normal , twice by dashing as an action , thrice by dashing as a bonus action , and a fourth time through the * haste * extra action . 
  that 's a grand total of 280 ft. in 6 seconds , or just two seconds to make second base . 
  you can achieve this at level 10 . 
  if you 've got more levels , monk is a great option . 
  there are also magic items you might be able to use if you can get them . 
  have a look around , do some market research and see what others are charging . 
  you probably want to sit around that level or a little bit lower , depending on how much formal training * they * have got in teaching . 
  as others have said , it depends on a number of factors including cost of living . 
  cormyr is in faer\u00fbn . 
  in fact , it 's only a tiny distance away from the sword coast !, 
  based on [ this quite out of date map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0iwliac.jpg ) it seems to be less than 1000 miles due east of baldur 's gate .

  sorry , but your work contains art assets or other content that is not properly credited and ** will be removed ** if they are not added in a reasonable timeframe . 
  please review your work and apply proper credit for sources . 
  if the issue is art assets , please look at the following guide :, 
  for finding art that can be used freely used ; if you are unable to find a source to credit . 
  sometimes it is not completely clear that assets are being used uncredited , and homebrews will slip through the cracks . 
  fret not and please do not feel singled out . 
  if your homebrew is removed , you are welcome to repost it once the proper credits have been established . 
  the monstrous races are not a good guideline for building races . 
  they are quite clearly * not * designed to be balanced for normal play . 
  in case you 're not already aware , [ the mousefolk race ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 393a6q/homebrew _ mouse_race_pdf / ) is one of the earliest high quality homebrew pieces for 5e and it seems to sit in more or less the same niche as this . 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  what 's ethereum got to do with your computer specs ? 
  but anyway , ethereum is actually a kinda cool bit of tech . 
  it 's almost certainly never going to take off , but out of the cryptocurrencies i think it 's the most interesting , with the distributed app system . 
  for example , it could potentially be the best way to do voting online . 
  ( of course `` the best way ... online '' does ** not ** mean `` better than paper and pencil ballots '' , for a variety of reasons . ), 
  i thought on of the most interesting parts of this video was the talk about sat scores and * why * students who listen to beethoven are more likely to score higher . 
  it basically comes down to `` correlation does not equal causation '' , and it 's very interesting that sideways described all this without ever actually needing to mention that phrase . 
  hi sorry , but this has been removed because you did not edit in credit for the art in a reasonable timeframe . 
  feel free to resubmit at a later date if you have edited in appropriate credits . 
  i think by `` do n't have insurance '' , what she meant was `` i do n't have insurance that would cover * this debt * '' because , as you say , it 's a debt with someone who would n't accept insurance . 
  google says, 
   parks and leisure australia is the key professional association which provides services to members of the parks and leisure industry . 
  i do n't think that 's really what she meant , but it 's amusing nonetheless . 
  i just lost all respect for you . 
  what about her ? 
  no joke , it 's cheaper to get [ from newcastle to sydney ] ( https://transportnsw.info/trip#/?wspeed=4&amp;wduration=20&amp;itmode=walk&amp;routefilter=time&amp;train&amp;bus&amp;ferry&amp;lightrail&amp;coach&amp;schoolbus=false&amp;accessible=false&amp;arrdep=dep&amp;opalonly=false&amp;from=poiid:34142:95342008:-1:university%20of%20newcastle:callaghan:university%20of%20newcastle:any:poi:4940270:3649256:gdav:nsw&amp;to=10102054 ) than it is to get [ a simple one-zone trip ] ( https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones/current-fares ) here in brisbane .

  oh , right ha . 
  i guess they are all abc shows . 
  i think that says something about the state of australian-produced content on the other channels . 
  90 % of it is reality tv crap . 
  for what it 's worth , i also quite enjoy the chaser on channel 7 , although the british version is better than the australian imo , which is why i did n't mention it before . 
  eggheads and pointless are some other great british quiz shows , though i do n't watch those quite so often -- do n't even remember which channel carries them . 
   soap operas ( not good aus tv ),
