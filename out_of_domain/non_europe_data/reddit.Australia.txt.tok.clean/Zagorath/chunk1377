  while i agree with this , i know a lot of poms who would disagree with you there :p, 
   do we lose some of our australian spirit when shows are marketed to a global audience ? 
  i 'm not sure to what extent that is necessarily a problem . 
  i 've found a lot of australian media has trouble taking itself seriously , and that makes it hard to really care about it . 
  prime examples might be amateur productions like star wars downunder and the wizards of aus , which both had great potential but kept refusing to live up to it , instead choosing to play up dumb stereotypes for cheap laughs . 
  similarly , i saw an abc show where shaun micallef played a retired prime minister . 
  it was pretty good , but occasionally fell in to the same traps . 
  comparing to american comedies like modern family and brooklyn nine nine , which know exactly how to handle themselves to get a laugh , but also feel like real engaging characters you can care about , it 's a real shame . 
  yeah , it 's easy to forget -- since the game uses archaic measurement systems not in widespread use today -- just how large the values are . 
  one square is a whole metre and a half across . 
  that 's a lot of room in which to manoeuvre . 
  it 's not -- as might be intuitively thought -- merely the space of a single pivoting step . 
  two opponents could be as much as 3 & nbsp ; m apart , or as close as being face to face . 
  if they 're two squares apart , they could be as close as 1.5 & nbsp ; m , or as far as 4.5 & nbsp ; m ( as little as 5 & nbsp ; ft. , or as much as 15 & nbsp ; ft. , to use the game 's terminology ) . 
  ** any ** fantasy greataxe , warhammer , even greatsword , is far too large to wield effectively . 
  it 's one of the conceits of the genre , particularly in games , that characters are able to effectively swing things which would in real life be utterly unwieldy . 
  i put my right hand on the lid . 
  it 's pretty clear that our hands are designed to be stronger at inward twists ( clockwise in the left hand , anticlockwise in the right ) than outward twists , so physiologically , it 's easier to open using the right hand . 
  why else would they be designed in the way they are ? 
  what / u/fleefchickenslayer said is ** entirely ** incorrect with respect to forgotten realms dragonborn . 
  the dragonborn ** hate ** dragons . 
  they originated in another material plane , called abeir \\* , in which they were * enslaved * by dragons . 
  as a result , not only do they utterly hate chromatic dragons , and are extremely reticent to trust even good metallic dragons , but dragonborn are also very wary of * any * relationship which resembles that of a master/slave relationship ; for this reason , very very few of them worship gods . 
  \\* the prime material is called toril , which is why you sometimes hear the material planes of the forgotten realms referred to as abeir-toril, 
  hey sorry , but this has been removed . 
  this subreddit is for * stories * from tabletop roleplaying games , not other content related to them . 
  this might be more suited for / r/dnd . 
  hey thanks for all the work you guys do , but in this case it was a waste of your time . 
  this subreddit only allows stories , which the above post quite clearly was not , so the post has been removed . 
  bad bot, 
  is the guy on the left wearing a gas mask ? 
  because that 's the only way i can make sense of that head silhouette . 
  yes , they are real weapons . 
  you 'll note that i very specifically said any ** fantasy ** greataxe etc. 
  because the fantasy depictions of these weapons is * vastly * out of proportion with things that were used historically . 
  damn that does look really bloody cool . 
  but in terms of wieldiness , that thing looks a lot more manageable than , say [ these fantasy swords ] ( https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/5624-2-1326968824.jpg ) . 
   some sort of ` homebrewer 's handbook ' for world creation, 
  for worldbuilding ? 
  this exists . 
  it 's called the dungeon master 's guide . 
  i did n't even look at the mechanics , because i hate the fluff so much . 
  i agree . 
  i find the flavour of many of the classes incredibly compelling and i want to be using it most of the time . 
  if you do reach the point that / u/cjmw describes -- or even before then , if you just want a change -- i 'd highly suggest looking for a job at a good international school somewhere overseas -- east asia i 'd a great place to work . 
  it 's a great personal experience , but you 're also more likely to have parents and students who are much more appreciative of what you do , which can decrease the stress a lot and mean you spend more time teaching and less time dealing with behavioural problems . 
   it just needs to be more common practice for a teacher to have someone come into their classroom and see how they teach . 
  this is difficult to handle . 
  when i 've seen it done , it 's often been younger teachers coming in to observe and review the performance of much more experienced teachers . 
  quite understandably , experienced teachers do n't take kindly to someone who has only been on the job a few years acting as they though know better than what the older teacher has learnt through experience actually works . 
  if it were two actual peers reviewing each other , it might work better , but that is n't often how it 's done . 
  hey , i 've reflaired this as `` other '' for you , since the `` resource '' flair is intended to be for resources that aid other users creating their own homebrew . 
  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  we do not normally allow contests when they seem to primarily exist to serve as a request for content to be created for your own use . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  i dunno , some of that seems like a bit of a stretch . 
  most of it is fine , but i feel like your proficiency * bonus * should still exist , because it comes from your total levels , not your class . 
  this is useful because you get some skill proficiencies from your background , and some races have proficiencies that they can use . 
   proficiency bonus explicitly comes from your class, 
  no it does n't . 
  proficiency bonus comes from your character level . 
  here 's the exact quote from the [ basic rules ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop/players-basic-rules ) . 
  emphasis mine . 
   ## proficiency bonus, 
   your proficiency bonus is always ** based on your total character level ** , as shown in the character advancement table in chapter 1 , ** not your level in a particular class ** . 
  as for feats , the fact that the other option is an asi is precisely * why * they should be accessible . 
  if the character had instead chosen the asi , the ghost would have access to that bonus . 
  so of course the feat should be available as well . 
  mate , that 's all well and good , but completely beside the point . 
  class tables only include your proficiency bonus for convenience 's sake . 
  it 's quite explicitly a stat that is * not * based on your class , but only your total character level , as the `` proficiency bonus '' section describes . 
  i loved these two videos , and i would * love * to see more in a similar style . 
  devils are probably the coolest in my books , but i guess demons are okay too . 
  would n't mind seeing one about different types of less common creatures too , like elementals , plants , etc. 
   but its the rules of the game, 
  you simply saying it does not make it so . 
  the rules are quite clear about this matter . 
  `` your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level ... not your level in a particular class . '', 
  it does n't get much simpler than that . 
   first , it violates one of the coolest designs about the warlock : the separation between mechanical identity ( melee , caster , or minion master ) and flavorful identity ( the patrons ), 
  that is actually a really crucial point that i had never really considered before . 
   `` magic sword '' is a terrible patron concept, 
  yeah , that 's basically been my core problem with the patron all along . 
  not * only * for the reasons you described , but also because the patron is ** specifically ** called your `` otherworldly patron '' . 
  they should be a powerful being which inhabits a different plane of existence . 
  the hells . 
  the fey . 
  the far realm . 
  beings of these places make * great * patrons . 
  but it 's the same reason i do n't particularly like `` vampire '' or `` dragon '' as patrons : they 're beings native to the material plane , and thus it just feels * wrong * for them to grant this massive power to another being . 
  secondly , there 's also a strong sense of ludonarrative dissonance going on with the hexblade . 
  if you ** did ** accept the premise of a sword giving you your power , you probably want to * wield that sword * . 
  and yet it 's a warlock patron ; something you can carry with you from day * one * of adventuring . 
  thus \u00fcber-powerful magical artifacts are not a great idea . 
  and mechanically , the thing is designed assuming you * are n't * wielding the weapon itself . 
  that makes no sense !, 
  okay , fair cop . 
  how about this quote , which is from the section that actually * defines * what a proficiency bonus ** is ** .
