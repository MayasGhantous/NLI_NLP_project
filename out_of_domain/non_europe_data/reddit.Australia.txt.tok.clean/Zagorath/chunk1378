   characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level , as detailed in chapter 1 . 
  monsters also have this bonus , which is incorporated in their stat blocks . 
  monsters do n't have class levels . 
  if proficiency bonus was about your class levels , how could that be true ? 
  but what it * does * say is that your proficiency bonus is `` determined by level '' . 
  not by class . 
  not by levels in a class . 
  just `` by level '' . 
   think of it as a sorcerer . 
  you have innate eldritch ability, 
  then it should be a sorcerous origin , not an otherworldly patron . 
  warlocks are ** about ** people who have no particular power of their own channelling power from some other entry . 
  that is the entire * point * of the class . 
  how do you define `` around the capital '' ? 
  because seq is like three quarters of the state 's population . 
  the state 's population is 4.7 million . 
  brisbane 's greater statistical area has a population of about 2.4 million . 
  that 's half right there . 
  add just the gold coast/tweed heads greater statistical area and you 've got 3 million . 
  that 's before you add the sunshine coast or toowoomba . 
   this turned out to be important when they formed an army of trained peasants and low-level spellcasters to bring the pcs to justice . 
  well , go on . 
  did they ? 
  i 'm engaged in this story . 
  do n't stop there !, 
  i 'm not sure about the campaign , but they made a new ai with the hd version that 's available in multiplayer which is just * stupidly * hard to beat , even on equivalent difficulty level . 
  if that 's being used in the campaign , that might be the difference . 
   no one is accelerating the actual falling , that would n't make sense . 
  jet pack . 
  aimed downward . 
  specifically reduplication might not be universal , but something deriving from `` ma '' is very common even in non ie languages . 
  korean \uc5c4\ub9c8 ( ohm-ma ) , and vietnamese m\u1eb9 , for example . 
  paging / u/stolksdorf to be aware of this rather major issue . 
  you should also try using the service 's own built in [ issue tracker ] ( https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues ) to lodge an issue for this . 
   no penalty for ... normal movement . 
  i take this to mean that if you want to move and attack with a sword , you roll 1d12 , and ** not ** , 1d12 +1 d6 ? 
  or if you * only * want to move ( and only move 30 ft. , not taking dash ) , you would roll nothing at all ? 
  ( though obviously , if you 're planning on only moving , taking the `` dodge '' action , which costs 1d4 , would be a good idea . ), 
  are we doing r/brisbane memes in here now ? 
  do n't forget to turn on your lights !, 
  did anyone see that helicopter over the river last night ? 
  hi / u/mrcyberthief , it has just been brought to my attention that you are currently sharing this on the dm 's guild with a mandatory fee . 
  as you shared this on / r/unearthedarcana for feedback , we have a policy of requiring content be made available for free . 
  with the dm 's guild , that means we require you share it as pay what you want . 
  i hope you can appreciate the community spirit and switch it back to pwyw . 
  thanks . 
  presumably your concern over not allowing homebrew is to do with balance . 
  with that in mind , i would strongly suggest allowing content from / r/boh5e , a subreddit dedicated to only the highest quality homebrew , where it is reviewed in depth by experienced reviewers . 
  there is n't a * lot * of content there & mdash ; the process of in-depth reviews only by reviewers who are experienced enough to join their team is a necessarily slow one , so not a lot of content is able to pass through & mdash ; but what content ** is ** there is uniformly exceptional . 
  obviously from a thematic point of view you may not like all of it , but at the very least it is all quite well balanced , and reviews should point out specific areas where balance is a problem so you can fix it yourself if you wish . 
  except good practice is to not commit unless you have a working state . 
  so test by commenting out code , if it causes everything to crash , uncomment . 
  if it does n't destroy everything , * then * commit . 
   you never can be sure if you found alive code , or commented one, 
  does your editor not automatically display comments as different from live code ? 
  because i do n't think i 've ** ever ** used one that * did n't * . 
   i tried to clear up my code by removing some `` unnecessary '' curly braces on single-statement if-elses, 
  this is bad style , even if it is technically syntactically acceptable . 
  what about if you dodge and move ? 
  only oreo,

  kinda a clickbaity title here , but this is where it all started !, 
  the main thing i wonder about that rhythmic auditory stimulation therapy is how effective it is in the long term . 
  like , does it improve someone 's gait even when they 're * not * listening to music ? 
  or do they have to be constantly listening to music for it to work ? 
  either way , it 's fascinating . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  that 's the same behaviour we 're talking about . 
  officially it 's meant to be a red-only feature , but there are guides out there explaining how to get around this limitation . 
  it 's possible that some third-party utility you had installed for a different reason has also been updated to offer this . 
  not sure . 
  i agree for the most part , but there are certain things that enter the cultural lexicon in a way that it becomes unreasonable to avoid spoiling anyone . 
  things like darth vader being luke 's father and planet of the apes being set on a futuristic earth . 
  i actually suspect that in a decade or two ( if not already ) , some of the big game of thrones spoilers will fall into this category . 
  it 's not about age per se , so much as cultural significance . 
  the way i 've seen the spoilers increase enjoyment study explained in the past is that by knowing what the end is , instead of wondering what the mystery is , you get to watch all the foreshadowing , and the experience of doing that * knowing * that it 's foreshadowing increases enjoyment . 
  i have n't seen it explicitly said , but i believe the idea might be that you get to smile to yourself in a knowing way , thinking `` oh , that 's * clever * ! '', 
  as well as commend * yourself * for noticing it . 
  personally , i do n't entirely buy into it . 
  i think a good part of the experience is * not * knowing the twist the first time , but being able to go back later when you do know it and * then * see the foreshadowing . 
  that 's the sign of a great twist in my mind , when you never saw it coming the first time , but you can go back and think it so obvious . 
  and i think the experience is ruined somewhat if you * do * know it going in . 
  there 's more to having a satisfying overall experience than a simple self-rated `` enjoyment '' factor , which is why even though i actually * do * trust the results of the study , i still reject the most obvious conclusion to draw from it . 
  it 's worth noting that the books used for the study were ones with famous big twists in them , which might play in to this somewhat . 
  banned, 
  yeah , but the reference is wrong . 
  the jules verne book is about travelling 20,000 leagues while in a submarine . 
  the reference here tries to reference verne by claiming to * be * 20,000 leagues under the sea . 
  the abc 's pretty great . 
  also the footy .

  this took less than a * minute * to read . 
  it should n't even be * long * , let alone * epic * . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions .
