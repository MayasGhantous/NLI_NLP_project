   you can add double your proficiency bonus ... and have advantage on perception checks relying on smell, 
  i would do one * or * the other , not both . 
  usually , proficiency is something you either have or do not . 
  it 's not situational . 
  you use advantage as the situational ability . 
   ( does n't stack on top of already being proficient ), 
  this part is redundant . 
  ** panicked retreat ** is a really neat little ability . 
  it 's a design space that 's sadly not really used in 5e very much . 
  especially after `` bloodied '' ( below half health ) was such a core mechanic , and a highly successful one , in 4e . 
  anyway , i 'd rate the base race at 4.75 on the detect balance scale , assuming you remove the proficiency aspect from ___ . 
  i 've chosen to rate panicked retreat as 0.75 . 
  sneaky rats i would score 2.0 , giving commune with rodents 0.5 . 
  that makes the total 6.75 . 
  friendly rats i 'd rate 1.75 . 
  and i want to say i * really * like the flavour of sleazy salesman . 
  that makes their total 6.5 . 
  that puts both of them right in the sweet spot of power level ; again , * assuming you remove proficiency in perception * . 
  very nicely done . 
  some more flavour about the race would be much appreciated , and so would a more nicely formatted version , perhaps with some artwork . 
  presumably it 's to help their audience connect with them better . 
  good bot, 
  i do n't use or like crit fails , but just a random thought , what if , after rolling a 1 , you then have to succeed on a dc10 ability check using your weapon attack modifier ( e.g. , str + prof for an axe , dex + prof for a bow , etc. ) ? 
  that way as you get better they get less common . 
  in fact by level 9 many characters will * never * be able to fail , and by level 13 * most * wo n't . 
  ( alternatively , make it like dc12 or dc15 , if you would prefer it happen more often . ), 
   are you speeding it up, 
  who listens too podcasts * without * speeding it up ? 
  that just seems bizarre to me . 
  i personally prefer cinemasins when he 's sinning * good * movies . 
  similarly , i find [ cinemawins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucl8h3ri2wn_-ibviblwtucq ) more enjoyable when he tackles bad movies . 
  for example , the first few of his videos that i saw were man of steel and the star trek reboots . 
   when you 're really good , the chances of a crit fail go from about 2 % for an average person to 0.4 %, 
  i mean , that 's more or less what i 'm describing . 
  not those exact numbers , but that concept . 
  if it 's dc10 , the chance of an average first level character failing is 1 % ( 5 % roll a 1 , times 20 % of the time you pass the dc10 check , with +3 ability and +2 prof ) . 
  for a level 9 character with +4 ability and +4 prof , it 's 0.25 % crit fail . 
  changing that to dc15 , but with the other stats the same , a level 1 character will crit fail 2.25 % of the time , and a level 9 will 1.5 % . 
  back when the liberals got rid of labor 's carbon trading scheme , did n't they * force * power companies to give consumers a rebate ? 
  could they not do the same thing here ? 
  i always prefer level 1 . 
  it gives me a chance to get to understand my character 's personality better over time . 
  as they learn about their abilities and what they want to do with them in the world , so do i. 
  the party dynamic is something that i feel can , with a good dm and party , be introduced properly at any level , so that 's less of an issue for me . 
  swiftkey does this too . 
  it 's `` what if i * write * in french ? '',

   i hate this misconsception that early levels are only ok if you are a newbie, 
  so much this . 
  it 's an opportunity to truly get to know your character and understand how they feel about getting out into the world to adventure . 
  it 's easy enough to write a back story explaining * why * they set out to adventure , but until you actually start getting a feel for them in action you can never really know exactly * how * they 'll react to things . 
  there 's just no other way to start playing a character you want to roleplay in-depth * other * than starting at level 1 . 
  yeah that 's a really interesting point .
