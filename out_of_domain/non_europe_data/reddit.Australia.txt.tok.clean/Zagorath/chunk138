  the most specific one i 've got is probably `` best of romantic piano music '' . 
  to be honest , i hardly listen to them , really ... i prefer to go for the full symphony/concerto/sonata / whatever when i can . 
  perhaps compared to most of australia , it is , but would you really say it 's radical to believe people should have access to decent healthcare , education , and other public services , even if they ca n't afford to pay out the arse for it ? 
  what i hate is the idea that if you told them what you did , * you * would be seen as creepy or odd , even though * they * put the information out there to be found . 
  for me , it was being unable to read scores on the tv while watching sports . 
  when i got my glasses , first significant thing i remember was how clear the spokes on the cage around a fan were ... not very exciting or interesting . 
  i also realised , when i got back to school ( got glasses on holidays ) how much more easily i could read the board . 
  yeah , i saw that . 
  it does n't really do a good job of explaining what this site is actually about . 
  not that it matters , i 'm pretty sure it 's us only anyway . 
  that 's the only explanation i can think of for why it would n't accept my post code . 
  side note , any site , service , competition , etc. 
  that is restricted to a certain region and * does n't * make it fucking clear and obvious that it is restricted , yeah , fuck them . 
   composers really begin to give a flying fuck what people thought of their music, 
  so ... they start caring more than they did before ? 
  i think you meant `` really * stop * giving a flying fuck '' . 
  sorry , just that this , and other mistakes resembling '' * could * care less '' ( protip : it 's * could n't * ) really bug me . 
  but definitely , your point was an extremely good one , and was otherwise really well put . 
  just like composers today make pieces for different reasons , some with more artistic * integrity * than others ; some just created for the express purpose of pleasing lots of people . 
  i was on a few flights recently where they finally got rid of those signs . 
  it honestly makes no sense for them to have them anymore , since smoking 's banned on all flights ... 
  yeah , i have to agree with that guy . 
  if you can afford the cost of the meal , then you can afford to go out . 
  you should n't be chastised for being unable to tip well . 
  then again , i 'm not american and i really do n't understand why you guys ca n't just have a decent minimum wage so people do n't * need * to be tipped ... tipping just is n't a thing over here , and realistically why should it be ? 
  you 're not working for me , you 're working for your employer , they should be the ones paying you , not me . 
  if i were in america , of course i would tip -- i have no intention of being outright rude -- but i would n't just tip 10 % regardless . 
  i 'll tip based on the quality of service . 
  at first i thought this advice was for if you * are * the bad guy . 
  especially useful if you 're a good runner , and skilled at l'art du deplacement . 
  is your brand one of the ones mentioned in this thread so far ? 
  namely , is it in the following list :, 
  audio technica , grado , sennheiser , ultrasone , akg , fostex , shure, 
  i still understand if you ca n't say , but i would think narrowing it down to 7 top companies is n't too bad , right ? 
  you should probably have made that clearer . 
  that 's * definitely not * what a barbeque means in germany , and indeed over the rest of the world . 
  your initial comment would have made a lot of people think you ca n't get meat cooked on a barbeque . 
  i 'm trying to word it so the terms do n't get confused , but honestly i ca n't think of anything else to call a barbeque other than , well , barbeque ... 
  [ image for help ] ( http://hopecentrebrampton.webs.com/barbeque.jpg ), 
  the kiders without the toys ( the bars ) are so much tastier anyway ( because you get more of the chocolate !, 
  ) , and surely those are n't banned in the us ? 
  to be fair , it works in many other cases . 
  at a concert ? 
  turn that off and enjoy the beautiful music . 
  in classes or lectures , at a church or other religious location -- even , and perhaps especially , if you do n't believe in that religion -- and probably heaps more scenarios that i ca n't think of . 
  speaking of chocolate bars , you americans have horrible milky ways . 
  they 've got caramel that ruins them . 
  i only learnt this when i went on holiday to south america , and found that there 's were different , so i looked it up and at least according to the internet south america 's are the same as the ones in the us . 
  europe and australia get one without the caramel , and with a much tastier nougat .

  oh god , when i moved from korea to vietnam it took so long to find a good galbi restaurant . 
  ended up finding one that was absolutely amazing , every bit as good as proper korean in terms of the meat , and nearly as good with sides , but not until less than a year before i left vietnam ... 
  food of the gods,

  is chivalry anything like mount & blade combat ? 
  coos that game has amazing combat . 
  i 've heard a story that three musketeers and milky ways for mixed up in packaging , and so their names are no the wrong way around . 
  that 'd make sense if they then decided to fix the mistake for the global market . 
  really good , simple survey to complete . 
  good job on allowing really open ended answers to the questions about the surveyee ( race , gender , neighbourhood , etc. ), 
  the one thing that stands out as odd to me is the age groupings . 
  good job on not making the common mistake of overlapping the groupings , but it seems odd to group 18 year olds ( legally adults ) with 15 year olds . 
  i would usually advocate for making 18 the lowest age in whichever age range it is a part of . 
  it was an interesting survey to do , but i have to confess i ca n't think of what it would be you 're trying to study . 
  i hope we get to see the results when you 're done with it !, 
  this is why i save regularly and do n't use the `` ca n't quit without saving '' setting . 
  i always go see him because i do n't mind it when he asks me to go scout the area , those quests are fine . 
  i just tell him `` sorry mate , but no '' when asked to get cattle . 
  i 've never lost relation points for that . 
  i really do n't like the way that article was worded . 
  it seemed really biased against the nbn co , but it sounds to me like the town council was n't willing to work with them , so nbn just said fuck it , you can have satellite . 
  just wan na clarify , korea was a * little * different from all those others , in being a unsc-sanctioned war , and officially fought be the un . 
  i 've just ( really briefly ) looked into it , and i think you 're right . 
  here 's the story i had heard , but i 'm pretty sure it 's wrong, 
   when the milky way and three musketeers candy bars were introduced ( at the same time ) , mars somehow mixed up the wrappers , which explains why the candy bar with three main ingredients is called ` milky way ' and the milky candy bar is called ` three musketeers . ', 
  apparently they 've since fixed the ingredient labels but never corrected the original mistake . 
  perhaps us sanctioned , i 'm not sure . 
  korea was the only war ever * fought * by the un . 
  although it could be argued that is only semantics , anyway . 
  uhh ... forrest gump ? 
  * would * be the doppler effect ? 
  i was taught in high school that it * was * the doppler effect . 
  objects further away from us are receding from us more quickly , and thus there is a greater red shift . 
  is this not correct ? 
  what i was taught is that objects further away from us are receding more quickly , and therefore they have a greater red shift . 
  a more distant sound is n't necessarily moving faster , and so of course the sound is n't lower . 
  is that wrong ? 
  john cage 's 3 moments 3 seconds . 
  i ca n't find anything precise , but everywhere i go i keep getting the impression that korea was somehow different . 
  perhaps the strongest individual example is that `` united nations '' is listed as a belligerent in the [ korean war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) , but not in the [ gulf war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war ) . 
  another one is that when talking about the korean war , it is usual to talk about the south korean and united nations armies against the north koreans and their allies , whereas in the gulf war it is usual to refer to the united states and its allies . 
  korea is also the host to the world 's only un cemetery . 
  these , and a few other smaller factors , just make it feel as though the korean war was * fought * by the un , whereas the gulf war was merely * authorised * . 
  again , perhaps it 's just semantics , but it does feel different , to me . 
  then perhaps [ this ( warning , large pdf ) ] ( http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/imslp247187-pmlp82078-d_b_am._b._78__bwv_1047_.pdf ) will actually be bach ? 
  slow connection at the moment and ca n't actually get the pdf to load and check the quality of it , or even if it is truly a composer 's manuscript as imslp claims ( though it has a tendency to be reliable , so i suspect it is ) . 
  [ try taking a look at this ] ( http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/imslp247187-pmlp82078-d_b_am._b._78__bwv_1047_.pdf ) . 
  i ca n't right now , slow connection , but it should be bach 's manuscript for brandenburg concerto no. 2, 
  ah , you can do that ?
