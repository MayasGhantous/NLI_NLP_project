  i sunset if there 's any difference between music designed to really grab your attention like classical ( particularly around romantic period ) and jazz , compared to music meant to fade into the background like easy listening and video game soundtracks . 
  come on mate , it was clearing a joke . 
  wait , it 's country limited ? 
  i 'm on my phone and wo n't check the site 'til i get to a computer , but that seems really strange . 
  if it 's meant to be crowd sourced , why ca n't anyone put any location ? 
  also , is australia supported yet ? 
  how does one do this without noticing ? 
  if the email address is n't active , do n't you normally get a failed to send response ? 
  thankfully , html does not respect these people 's wrong opinion . 
  you can put two spaces after a sentence ( as i did just here , although i hate myself for it ) , but nobody will see it . 
  we have the 8th lowest population density of any nation on earth , and the * least * dense out of countries in the top 100 by total population . 
  but despite this , we 're actually one of the most centralised/urbanised places on earth . 
  18th , in fact ( which is especially impressive when you consider the 4 way tie at places that are literally only a single city , plus many other places like luxembourg and san marino which are effectively just a single city ) . 
  the three biggest cities in australia make up a combined 50 % of the total population , and the top 10 cities make up over 72 % . 
  awesome, 
  it works after colons , too . 
  html just does n't recognise multiple consecutive white space characters . 
  it does n't matter what the context is . 
  ( check the source of this comment . ), 
   but you still have to double space to get one space . 
  that 's a markdown feature , not an html one . 
  markdown is the name of the mark-up language that reddit uses , as well as a bunch of other places like github . 
  it 's the one where ''  '' creates block quotes , asterisks create italic , etc. 
  ** crazy ** overpowered , plus is rather poor thematically given what people usually think of when they think `` psionics '' . 
  prefix each line with ''  '' to have it display as greentext .

  sorry , but we are not a subreddit for requests . 
  this includes requests for someone to make something new , requests for pointers on where to find existing material , and advice for how to create new content . 
  you might want to try posting a comment in the latest arcana forge megathread , which is pinned at the top of the subreddit , or searching the subreddit using both [ google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana ) and [ reddit 's own built in search ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  best of luck . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
   there is no `` link '' to the rules because they are n't on their own page . 
  / r/dndnext/about / rules, 
  damn , that 's disappointing . 
  i totally get wanting to prevent people openly discussing piracy , but linking to useful tools available online should be completely fine . 
  especially given how overzealous wizards ' legal team is , i do n't see anything wrong with allowing links to any website that helps players and dms manage their games , if wizards has n't seen fit to force the site down . 
  i dislike this parody , because it makes it seem like pineapple on pizza is okay , by comparing it to the deplorable anti-gay advertising . 
  pineapple on pizza is an abomination and should not be tolerated in civilised society . 
  comparing it to being gay , which is a completely natural and uncontrollable part of some people , is disgusting . 
  the anzac is died for ? 
  or are you referring to the `` died for '' belonging to the anzac ? 
  tomatoes are a culinary vegetable , but a botanical/biological fruit . 
  botanically/biologically , `` vegetable '' is n't a category that exists . 
  it 's just a little awkward because fruit is a term that exists in both fields , and there is significant overlap in how it 's used . 
  i 'm not sure if you 'd call it a jrpg or not , but dark cloud is an excellent game , with a really cool approach to the `` rpg '' - like aspects . 
  instead of levelling your own character , you level and customise your * weapons * . 
  like most of what they do , this video is absolutely excellent . 
  so are the other two videos in the series . 
  but it raises a question in me . 
  is the witcher a jrpg ? 
  the instinctive answer is obvious . 
  no , of course it 's not ; that 's a stupid question . 
  but looking at the qualities that extra credits is describing as the difference between western and japanese rpgs , the witcher seems to tick many boxes for the latter . 
  you 're * not * playing yourself , you 're playing a pre-existing character with their own defined backstory , personality , and goals . 
  you as the player merely act as the puppet master controlling how geralt goes about achieving his goals . 
  it 's a heavily story-focused game where the relations between characters are an important part of the experience . 
  apart from the `` pre-existing character with a defined personality '' part , witcher obviously has all of this in a much lesser degree than , say , final fantasy . 
  but it 's a lot more than skyrim . 
  it seems to me that it would n't be * so * far from true to claim it 's a borderline jrpg-wrpg , leaning slightly more on the jrpg side . 
  if you have n't yet received your survey , do n't panic . 
  please ** do not contact abs ** unless you have n't received your survey by ** 25 september ** . 
  that is the date by which everyone should have received their survey . 
  after the 25th , you 've got until 20 october to contact the abs and receive a replacement survey . 
  i have n't really been watching this . 
  just checking out the score every half hour to hour or so . 
  did australia get the final wicket on the final ball or something ? 
  the score i 'm seeing says 10/252 off 50 . 
  haha that 's brilliant . 
  til americans are not wrong about * everything * . 
  sorry , but your work contains art assets or other content that is not properly credited and ** will be removed ** if they are not added in a reasonable timeframe . 
  please review your work and apply proper credit for sources . 
  if the issue is art assets , please look at the following guide :, 
  for finding art that can be used freely used ; if you are unable to find a source to credit . 
  sometimes it is not completely clear that assets are being used uncredited , and homebrews will slip through the cracks . 
  fret not and please do not feel singled out . 
  if your homebrew is removed , you are welcome to repost it once the proper credits have been established . 
  i do n't know what you mean by occ . 
  do you mean cc ( as in , creative commons ) , or perhaps cc0 ( creative commons universal , effectively public domain ) ? 
  or perhaps something else ? 
  if you mean cc , then the license actually * requires * you to give credit to the creator . 
  depending on the specific type of cc , it might have other stipulations that you should make sure you are aware of . 
  unless it 's cc0 , in which case you can legally do absolutely whatever you want with it . 
  however , for the sake of transparency and simplicity , we at / r/unearthedarcana require you give credit for all artwork you use . 
  if it * is * cc0 or otherwise public domain , a simple `` artwork sourced from public domain '' will suffice . 
  you can put the credit underneath each picture , at the very beginning of the document , or in a small little box right at the end of the whole document . 
  it 's just important to us that you have something there , in the interest of being good internet citizens . 
  hope that helps !, 
   there 's actually a way to get things wrong here , because in french `` rouge '' just means `` red '', 
   `` rogue '' means something like `` haughty and unpleasant '' . 
  i do n't understand how your `` final tip '' is the logical progression from the rest of your comment . 
  it seems to imply that if you park on private land and are towed , you wo n't have to pay anything . 
  but if you are towed from public land you may have to pay a fine .
