  how is that the better option ? 
   do n't roll if you ca n't or should n't fail, 
  also , even if you * can * fail , do n't roll if there 's no * consequence * for that failure . 
  picking a lock with zero time pressure ? 
  automatic success . 
  picking a lock with a guard about to come around the corner , or where failure might set off a trap , make some loud noise , break the lockpicks , or where behind the door is a wizard trying to complete some dark ritual ? 
  then make a check . 
  [ this article ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) does an excellent job of elaborating on the concept . 
  that 's actually really interesting . 
  when i saw it i both knew about the twist and knew that it * was * a twist . 
   i 'd even be ok with paying $ 5 or $ 10 for the digital copy if you own the physical . 
  there is still a little work that needs to be done to create a pdf from the file used to create the books . 
  i would n't . 
  the amount of extra work the would have to do is minuscule , and it only needs to be done once . 
  after that , the cost is zero . 
  they already have the network infrastructure to support this , so they wo n't incur any extra cost that way . 
  and i 'm including the cost of altering the website to support this download in the minuscule amount of extra work . 
  amortised over the thousands of people who would want to do this , the cost per person would be effectively zero , and that 's what wizards should provide it for . 
  to produce goodwill with their customers , because at the moment the relationship feels almost like one of animosity . 
   not all the details matter ... a lot of the details about any given character keep changing . 
  but who the character is at her or his core does matter . 
  take note , snyder . 
  just because details change over time does n't make it okay to completely undermine their characters !, 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  ability | score, 
  swim speed | +0.5, 
  amphibious | +0.5, 
  extended darkvision | +0.75, 
  sunlight sensitivity | -0.5, 
  otherworldly perception material | +2, 
  otherworldly perception etherial | +0.25, 
  slippery | +1, 
  bite | +0.25, 
  that 's a total of 7.75 . 
  that 's * crazy * strong . 
  well outside the bounds of acceptability . 
  you need to cut it down by about 1 point . 
  my recommendation would be to drop otherworldly perception entirely , and find something else to put in its place . 
  maybe a skill proficiency or something simple like that ? 
  has gotham moved which day of the week it airs on or something ? 
  it 's [ detect balance ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6prabw5lhy6amh-bnb4oub8dbxl1rszrot03sc/edit#gid=0 ) in its original form , where +1 is equivalent to an asi of +1 . 
  take the values that display there at the moment , and divide by 4 . 
  i should probably also add that i make a few changes . 
  i view standard darkvision as being worth 0.5 , not the 0.75 that the spreadsheet would suggest , and therefore extended darkvision as 0.75 , not 1 , for example . 
  level 20 ability . 
  anyone know what the going odds on this match are ? 
  huh . 
  that seems surprisingly close tbh . 
  i do n't use it myself , but from what i 've heard it apparently actually ** is ** a lot better than internet explorer used to be . 
  i 'm never going to touch it because i want a browser i can use on all my devices . 
  windows , mac , linux , and android . 
  but if i were a windows-only guy i 'd probably consider switching tbh . 
  the battery life impacts alone are , from what i 've heard , well worth it . 
  i 've reflaired this for you . 
  the `` resource '' flair is for resources that can be used to help others make their own homebrew .

  there is a spell tag . 
  and now that you mention it , that 's probably more appropriate anyway .
