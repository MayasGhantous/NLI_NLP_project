  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' .

  if the issue is art assets , please look at the following guide :, 
  for finding art that can be used freely used ; if you are unable to find a source to credit . 
  sometimes it is not completely clear that assets are being used uncredited , and homebrews will slip through the cracks .

  hey , just so you know , our art requirement is only that you give credit to the author . 
  we 're totally fine with you using art that you got from absolutely * anywhere * , even if you did n't explicitly obtain permission . 
  just letting you know , since you seem to have removed the art since the last time you received a warning about using it uncredited . 
  creative commons ** specifically ** means you have to give credit to the artist . 
  that 's literally the ** one ** requirement to legally use cc material . 
  you ca n't just say `` it 's cc '' . 
  you need to say * who * created it . 
  ( well , if it 's cc-by , anyway . 
  cc-by-nc , cc-by-sa , and cc-by-nd have greater burdens on them . ), 
  ah , yeah if it 's cc0 then you can legally use it without credit . 
  on this subreddit , we do n't actually require you follow the strict letter of copyright law . 
  instead , we require that you follow good internet practices : that you give credit to the original creator . 
  even if you have n't got * permission * , just make sure you give credit . 
  for cc0 stuff , or public domain stuff , just make sure you specify that cc0 or public domain is what it is . 
  ( or , honestly , just credit the specific artist anyway . 
  it 's not so hard . 
  but doing either is fine . ), 
  if we do n't know that it 's cc0 or pd , we 're gon na send you a message like the one above . 
  i do n't know about everyone else , but the top recommendation for me in the sidebar was humans need not apply . 
  this is a somewhat less depressing in tone take on the same topic , but no less sobering . 
  [ fear the boot ] ( http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/ ) is absolutely exceptional . 
  it has a really unfortunate name , and i know i put off trying it for a long time because i thought it sounded silly . 
  but it is not . 
  it is * totally * worth it . 
  [ dungeon master 's block ] ( https://dungeonmasterblock.podbean.com/ ) and [ game master 's journey ] ( http://www.starwalkerstudios.com/gamemastersjourney/ ) are two that i personally briefly listened to , and would at least recommend you give them a go . 
  personally i found each of them had some quality that drew me away from them after a while . 
  [ critical success ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/category/podcasts/critical-success ) is , in my opinion , the greatest of them all . 
  it was sadly shortly lived , and has podfaded now , but the archives are still greatly worth listening to . 
  [ here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ) is a fucking fantastic story from the / r/dndgreentext [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  it ... sorta fits your query . 
  [ and here is the same post , with an alternate set of comments ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2wa4nb/evil _ is_subtle / ) . 
  if you 're looking for feedback on homebrew , you 'll generally get a much better reception at / r/unearthedarcana than here . 
   back in 2015, 
  depending on * when * in 2015 you asked , it * did * come back . 
  briefly . 
  there were 2 in each of july and august , one in september and december , and then one in february 2016 . 
  before then , the longest gap it had was 4 months . 
  sometimes it came in bursts , sometimes slow but steady . 
  but never more than a few months between podcasts . 
  the last one was in february 2016 , which means it 's been over 19 months since the last one . 
  maybe it 'll come back . 
  i 'd certainly love them to . 
  but i 've never known a podcast that 's podfaded for nearly two years to come back . 
  it 's also very hard to support a podcast that 's already in a state of podfading . 
  critical success does n't * have * a patreon , and even if it did i 'd be reluctant to fork over money for something that currently shows no signs of becoming an active podcast again . 
  hi sorry , but this has been removed because you did not edit in credit for the art in a reasonable timeframe . 
  feel free to resubmit at a later date if you have edited in appropriate credits . 
  i use gsm .

  well said eddie . 
  i 'd like to share another video , not about footy specifically , but claiming [ `` all media is political '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryz_la3dn4c ) . 
  the idea of asking our media to stay out of politics is ludicrous . 
  like eddie said , the afl is made up of * people * , who have their own real political opinions and who might be , or know someone who is , affected directly by the results of this survey ( sorry sam , it 's not a plebiscite ) . 
  i wish eddie had been let talk . 
  it sounded like he was about to make another really good point relating to all the other businesses , like churches , which are getting politically involved . 
  but see , i do n't * want * to support one-shot . 
  i do n't like actual plays , and i * certainly * do n't want to give money supporting one on the really unlikely off chance that it could indirectly lead to a good but dead show being revived .
