  sometimes it is not completely clear that assets are being used uncredited , and homebrews will slip through the cracks . 
  fret not and please do not feel singled out . 
  if your homebrew is removed , you are welcome to repost it once the proper credits have been established . 
  i 'm not 100 % clear on what it is you want here , really . 
  in markdown tables , you can set the alignment using colons in the row under the header row . 
  view the source of this comment to see an example of how it 's done . 
  foo | bar | baz, 
  right aligned | centred | left aligned, 
  but unfortunately i do have to remove this post . 
  you can continue the conversation with me and the other users who have already commented in this thread , but if you want to keep the thread visible to everyone , you 'll need to repost it in the latest arcana forge megathread . 
  submissions to the subreddit are required to be immediately usable content , queries go in arcana forge . 
  below is the original text of your post , since once i remove it users will not be able to see it :, 
   not sure if there 's a more appropriate sub for this , but i 'm hoping that someone can help me out with using a homebrewery as my campaign journal for my game . 
  there 's a couple of things that i want to do that i ca n't find an easy way to do with it . 
  i 'd like to have a right-aligned table in my npc entries where i could put some basic biographical info : race , sex , known associates , known relatives , affiliation , etc. 
  i 'd like to be able to have small icons in line with the text of various headers that would work almost as tags . 
  a small treasure chest in front of the word `` loot '' for loot lists in the journal , a skull icon in front of the name of deceased npcs , maybe some simplified organizational logos for npcs who are known to be members of those organizations , and so on . 
  hi , sorry , but i 'm having to remove this post . 
  we require content shared on / r/unearthedarcana be immediately usable by anyone who comes across it . 
  for an adventure , it does n't necessarily have to be 100 % completed , but at the very least the start of the campaign should be available . 
  some mere background information is not sufficient . 
  if you want feedback on what you 've got so far , you can submit it to the arcana forge megathread . 
  it surprises me that all the well known dragonborn ( and non-dragonborn with dragonborn names ) characters from erin m. evans ' books have their * given * names in the male and female tables , but none of the big players had their clan names in this table . 
  where 's verthisathurgiesh at ? 
  why no kepeshkmolik ? 
  ophinshtalajiir is the only name in that table that i recognise at all . 
  also , on the note of them being a mouthful , [ here 's a quote from evans ] ( http://slushlush.com/2013/04/a-draconic-primer/ ) ( the person responsible for penning many of the names ) :, 
   sometimes people wonder why the dragon names are so long and unwieldly in the god catcher . 
  clytemorrenestrix , andareunarthex , karshinevin -- these names are bulky . 
  so bulky when they start hanging with humans , they get nicknames . 
  no one has time for six syllables , you guys!the short answer is `` that 's how it is ! '' that 's how dragon names in d&d have long been . 
  but also i like it . 
  wtf does a dragon care how long its name is ? 
  they 're not in any rush . 
  the idea that humans and humanish people shorten them is perfect . 
  then just tell us that !, 
  we have no way of knowing where the art comes from without being told in the document , so we maintain a blanket rule requiring all art to be credited . 
   the answer is mostly always that the dm does not abide to the 6-8 encounter per long rest guidelines, 
  that 's because they 're terrible guidelines . 
  if the vast majority of people do not have 6 & ndash ; 8 encounters per day ( which it certainly seems is the case ) , then balancing around that number was a bad move . 
  that 's wizards ' fault , not any dm 's . 
  it 's obviously a ** lot ** smaller than asia minor though . 
  according to google , it would take about 400 hours to walk from the far north-west to the south-eastern edge of turkey . 
  [ from what i could find ] ( / r/worldbuilding/comments / 11fvsx/long _ distance_horse_riding_versus_walking / ) , it seems that travelling by horse is roughly twice as fast as walking . 
  so that 's 200 continuous hours of travelling to cross turkey . 
  that 's 8 days of continuous travel . 
  if we assume you spend 8 hours sleeping , but travel at the same pace for the entire rest of the time ( with your horse somehow not getting tired ) , that 's a 12 day trip . 
  you can cross calradia in a couple of days . 
  yeah i got it . 
  damn annoying spam . 
  i wish i knew how they got my number . 
  it 's got me irrationally angry . 
  it 's not going to change my vote , but i can definitely see it might push someone who was more borderline than me over to the wrong side . 
  and i ca n't possibly imagine anyone who would see that and think `` you know what , i was n't going to vote yes , but now i will '' . 
  what the ** fuck ** were they thinking with this ? 
  i 'm like 40 % sure that currently there are some companies which * think * it 's being charged to us in aud , and so they set the price at a level appropriate for that . 
  then , because it 's actually usd , we get charged the extra cost of converting again . 
  essentially , instead of our price being 1.27 times the us price , we 're getting charged 1.61 times , thanks to the retarded situation of being charged unique australian prices , but in usd . 
   most people have likely already voted, 
  and here i am not having even received mine yet . 
   a shiny dollar, 
  are you [ australian ] ( https://www.aboutaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/australia-1-dollar-coin.jpg ) , per chance ? 
  encounters actually do n't have to be combat . 
  they can be social or exploration encounters as well . 
  the requirement is merely that the party be forced or strongly encouraged to expend resources . 
  but ** even then ** i think 6 -- 8 is too many . 
  i 'd usually have 2 -- 5 ; very often at the lower end of that . 
  and maybe only 1 or 2 combat encounters per day . 
  i * finally * got my parents okay with paywave this past winter . 
  they still pay for most stuff in cash . 
  and they ( well , my dad at least ) is actually normally pretty tech forward . 
  he does quite a bit of pretty advanced stuff with tech for his work . 
  good luck with that , considering you are not legally entitled to it . 
   it 's a pain in the ass to plan 6-8 encounters per session, 
  well , reading this chain of comments , a single session should not line up with an in game day . 
  sometimes ( especially over long distance travel ) you might get through multiple days in a single session . 
  sometimes ( especially if you 're in a prototypical dungeon ) a single day might take multiple sessions . 
  by your own calculation , that 's $ 19 per hour . 
  that 's less than minimum wage . 
  and that 's before taking in to account any costs other than fuel . 
  annoyingly , the time it takes to siege a city * does n't * seem to be scaled appropriately to the size of the map . 
  it 's impossible to starve out a city because the time it takes is enough for the rest of their leaders to raise an entire army from scratch , gather together , and then close in on you . 
   still got a `` oh there 's actually some cash in here , guess there 's still some honest people around '' , guess i wo n't bother next time, 
  i 'm confused . 
  how is their reaction there in any way a negative one ? 
  they literally just called you an honest person . 
  the army should be assigning roles based on ability , and ability * only * . 
  the fact is that , for biological , sociological , or whatever other reason ( it really does n't matter what the reason is ) , the vast majority of men are physically stronger than the vast majority of women . 
  but that should n't mean that those women who * are * strong enough to do the job should be rejected . 
  any woman who is up to the task -- and there certainly are a not insignificant number of them -- should he just as welcome as any man who can do it . 
  nah , i doubt it . 
  more likely to do with my mail redirect slowing things down . 
   without having access to the header area to add new css to the page, 
  you * can * add new css to the page . 
  just put it inside of a set of `` style '' tags right at the top of the document . 
  for an example , see the built in `` switch to a4 paper '' option .
