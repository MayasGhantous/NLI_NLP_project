  the map at 1:30 that he talks about `` boundaries that must be kept '' makes me sad . 
  'cause i love all of the categories he put up on the page , except for tumblr . 
  in the pdf somewhere . 
  does n't matter where . 
  most people put it either in a little box of credits at the end , or with a little bit of text overlaid near the bottom or just below each picture . 
  is the artwork actually * by * riot games ? 
  i was under the impression ( based both on your own description and the look of the art ) that at least some of them are fan works based on riot characters . 
  in which case you do need to credit the actual artists . 
  you can throw in all the credits at the beginning , they do n't need to be as you use them . 
  but each of the artists do need to be credited . 
  if they all belong to riot directly , then let me know and i 'll restore it . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  my apologies . 
  the most is restored . 
  so , are you gon na do it ? 
  reading this comment in my inbox , not knowing what its context was , i was * so * confused . 
  i 'm guessing autocorrect is to blame , but in case it is n't , ball * o * t is what you vote with . 
  ball * e * t is a dance . 
  one too many syllables in the second line there mate . 
  i 'm not american so i do n't really understand how american credit works . 
  but could n't you punish equifax by refusing to * ever * unfreeze them ? 
  and just use one of the other agencies any time you need a credit report ? 
  this is one reason i love the ib . 
  theory of knowledge is a fantastic course that teaches a bunch of stuff that really aahojld be more commonly known . 
   its people like employers or landlords that will check, 
  then why can you not tell them `` check with one of the other bureaus , i have frozen my equifax account after their utter disregard for my privacy '' ? 
  then why can you not tell the credit issuer `` check with one of the other bureaus , i have frozen my equifax account after their utter disregard for my privacy and the security of my data '' ? 
   can a fencer just lop these off, 
  i do n't fancy your luck . 
  fencing foils are really not very good at cutting things .

  they can be quite dangerous . 
  edit the url to point directly to whatever it is , and then i can manually approve this comment . 
  you might want to also fix up your pdf version .

  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions . 
  ** as this is your second warning , any future unflaired submissions may be removed . 
  if you are not sure how to flair , you have a number of options . 
  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively . 
  be wary when using this method to make sure it is applying correctly . 
  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
  how about an egg ball * mini * league ? 
  a bunch of games over a single weekend , or even a single evening . 
  the lesser commitment might entice more people to sign up ? 
  [ here 's a clip of him doing that same bit .

  generally speaking that 's a theme that 's a little too specific for a whole class . 
  great idea for a subclass though .

  it 's very good . 
  here are a bunch more , but i ca n't vouch for their quality as i have n't looked at them .

  there are also , surprisingly , at least two different versions of an ice themed rogue :,

   most spells are a themed collection of effects that changes depending on what spell level you spend to cast it, 
  i have just one spell of this nature that i would suggest , based on a homebrew i 've used in what is otherwise a mostly rules as written magic system . 
  which is that when * polymorph * is cast using a 5th level or higher spell slot , the target can transform into any creature other than aberrations , celestials , elementals , fey , fiends , and undead . 
  ( as opposed to with a 4th level spell slot , where it is only beasts . ), 
  say , 3 parts ? 
  also , maybe a belt with 7 gems that have to be put in the right order . 
  in literature , this is a pretty common trope , so it 's not a bad idea . 
  however , the way i 've nearly always seen it play is that they only gain additional power when ** all ** of the items are combined . 
  * 4 of the 5 planateer rings are combined worth exactly the same as 4 separately . 
  but all 5 summon captain planet . 
  * 7 of the gems in deltora each have their own separate powers . 
  but when combined with the belt of deltora and placed in the right order , they become significantly more powerful . 
  * the balls in dragon ball might not have any particular power on their own , but combined they do . 
  * marvel 's infinity gems and the infinity gauntlet . 
  * etc. 
  i would perhaps suggest you consider having it work in this way . 
  not only because it 's an appropriate literary trope , but also for balance reasons . 
  it creates a situation where you can balance each of the items how you want independently , and then create a separate magical item rule for when all of them are combined . 
  you do n't have to worry about balancing for the more complicated situations as they are being collected . 
  soliloquy is a cgpgrey-esque youtuber ( although , as you can see in this video , his style has diverge a fair bit from grey 's since he started out & mdash ; although the subject matter is broadly the same ) . 
  here 's his take on the new zealand election , including examples involving hello internet and the nail & gear . 
  i can not fathom why hank green or michael from vsauce are evil , but if you 've listened to * any * amount of hello internet , it 's not hard to see why op would call grey lawful evil . 
  questions of `` what does good and evil/law and chaos mean in this context ? '', 
  * abound * in roleplaying circles . 
  it 's virtually impossible to find a singular definition that will work in all cases always .
