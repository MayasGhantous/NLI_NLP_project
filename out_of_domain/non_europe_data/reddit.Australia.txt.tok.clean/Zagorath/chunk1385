  but generally speaking , evil can range from being `` hurting , oppressing , and killing others '' to simple selfishness and wanting the world to be in a way that pleases you personally without regard for how it will affect others . 
  selfless vs. selfish is a fairly common way of differentiating between good and evil . 
  law vs chaos is much , * much * harder to define such that i 'm not really even going to attempt it right now . 
  and ab for agonising blast . 
  i have n't watched it yet ( no spoilers please -- i 'm not reading through this thread ) , but am i alone in not seeing it available yet ? 
  netflix just tells me to watch the trailer , and says `` new episode coming september 25 '' . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  is the uk on daylight saving time at the moment ? 
  another guy said 0700 utc . 
   how quick the bouts were , how long the breaks were, 
  i ... just ... did they not recognise the irony in that * at all * ? 
  do they have any idea what the most popular sport in their country is like ?

  being able to * select * three weapons that you are proficient in is ... highly unusual , to say the least . 
  i 'd recommend just picking ones that make sense . 
  rapiers and longswords are a good fit for vampires in my opinion . 
  maybe just the same proficiencies as a rogue . 
   you are considered undead as well as humanoid for all purposes, 
  this is unclear . 
  what exactly does it mean ? 
  if a spell says it `` has no effect on undead '' does it work on you , since you `` are considered ... humanoid for all purposes '' ? 
  my suggestion : either turn the character directly into undead , or follow the cue of the [ vryloka ] ( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/vydfopkag ) and specify that the character can choose whether to count as undead or humanoid in any given case . 
  vulnerability to silvered weapons is unorthodox , but still , i really like it . 
  for a vampire , i feel that having the same weakness in sunlight as a drow is just now good enough . 
  the penalty should be much steeper . 
  the flaw you 've given for needing to drink blood is wholly insufficient . 
  i would again point you to the vryloka 's penalty for not drinking enough , as well as to walrock 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlcvnhtk1wu1u1ztq/view ) for some good examples of how to do weakness in not drinking blood ( the latter also has a good example for sunlight ) . 
  i feel that the vampire claws being such a central mechanic is a mistake . 
  yes , vampires do infamously have sharp claws that they can use in many iterations . 
  but it 's not a central part of their concept , so it feels odd to use it as the core scaling mechanic . 
  i would have made it a static little perk that they get , rather than such a central part of them . 
  tunnel fighter is widely regarded as massively overpowered and should not be encouraged by allowing it here . 
  in my opinion , reducing an opponent 's damage by a certain amount is an odd effect for drinking their blood to have . 
  instead i would suggest making the target have * disadvantage * on their next attack . 
  at this point , i 've gotten to 5th level , and i 'm noticing some major problems . 
  the first is that two of the core , most important parts of vampirism have not been even remotely represented yet . 
  by 5th level all of the core ideas should have been introduced . 
  in fact , really , even by 3rd level you should be able to fully recognise everything . 
  there has been no seduction , no charming or beguiling abilities . 
  and there has been no amount of transformation . 
  no bat form or mist form . 
  and that is a major problem at this point . 
  i can see from the table that the transformation stuff comes later , and that one of the subclasses deals with the beguiling . 
  but that 's too little and too late . 
  a core part of the concept 's identity should not be * only * available by subclass , or not represented until level ** 9 ** . 
  infection should be based on the target making a saving throw . 
  probably constitution , but i guess a charisma or wisdom save could also work . 
  set it to 8 + prof + cha . 
  praetor 's chosen is a pretty cool capstone , but the sidebar about knight retainers makes it a lot less interesting . 
  that feature is specifically intended to not be too useful , balanced for 1st level characters to be able to get it for free . 
  a capstone should n't need that same limitation . 
   when you make a successful attack roll against a creature , all following attacks gain a +2 to their attack and damage rolls, 
  is that meant to be a permanent bonus ? 
  that seems way too powerful if so . 
  how long is it meant to last ? 
  i find the `` centred on the raven '' aspect of darkness prevails '' rather odd . 
  what 's the thematic justification for this limit ? 
  it does n't come from anywhere in folklore that i can think of , or any other iterations of vampirism . 
  similarly , what 's the flavour justification for solace of shadow ? 
  other than that , both the predator and shadow subclasses are absolutely brilliant . 
  the sanguimancer is mechanically alright , but thematically i find it a little disappointing . 
  other 3rd casters get some minor ability apart from spellcasting at 3rd level . 
  arcane tricksters with their special * mage hand * , eldritch knights with their bound weapons . 
  this could have some minor flavourful ability . 
  the level 10 and 15 abilities are decent mechanically ( dominance acquisition might be a little weak for such a high level ability ) , but mechanically just ... dull . 
  there 's nothing about them that i find evocative or interesting . 
  i mentioned earlier that i thought the sanguimancer would be the subclass centred around the vampire 's beguiling nature . 
  i was disappointed when i looked at the abilities to find that apart from having access to a couple of spells that can be used in that way , it actually really * is n't * the subclass i was exepecting . 
  this might not have been so much of a problem if the core class had done its job here , but this is essentially a double whammy of lame . 
  over all , i thought this was a pretty good start . 
  but it needs quite a bit of work to be considered really * good * . 
  i 'd highly recommend checking out the 4e vampire class from heroes of shadow , as well as walrock 's vampire prestige class for 5e . 
  they should help provide some really great inspiration for some of the ways in which this is lacking .

  sounds like stranded in fantasy . 
  [ it 's in our subreddit 's hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  mate , it 's not even 1300 characters long . 
  it 's not even ** close ** to epic . 
  i 'm reflairing this . 
   the logical part of me knows ... that qld is a rugby state, 
  you what mate ? 
  everything i can find about it suggests that you should be fine . 
  you normally need to have had your l for 2 years , for a logbook exception . 
  from what you 've told us you clearly * have * had that . 
  do you have any documentation proving this ? 
  it 's possible that they told you 2 years from the date you got your ls renewed without knowing you 've had them for much longer than that .
