  then again , it 's possible that the rules really ** do ** require you have had your * current * l licence for 2 years . 
  a bit shit if that 's true ( especially since you 're now allowed to get your hours up across multiple renewals of your l plates ) . 
  from everything i 've seen , it 's supposed to be quite easy to get tenure exceptions . 
  try going in to a different branch , or just to a different person . 
  i think you should be fine . 
  i 've never bought a qso concert in any way * other * than a single ticket for a single concert . 
  always through the qpac website , not the qso one . 
  i 've also never booked more than a month in advance , so my guess would be that they 'll probably become available to buy a single ticket closer to the date . 
  can i just say , though , the beethoven 's 7th concert looks brilliant . 
  prokofiev 's classical symphony is also an absolute masterwork . 
  i 'd also say the beethoven 's 3rd symphony concert looks pretty great . 
  not only is it a fantastic symphony ( better , imo , than the 7th ) , but the world premiere of a contrabass concerto sounds pretty cool . 
  and the `` russian marvels '' looks stunning . 
  a whole night of some of the best music out there . 
  shosty 's 10th , rhapsody on a theme of pagannini , and tchaikovsky 's marche slave !, 
  count me in !, 
  not a single dud in the lot . 
  are we looking at the same thing ? 
  i only see two hashtags . 
   other times our culture feels like a giant self-deprecating douchebag that 's become too chicken shit to take some pride in what it has accomplished and what it is striving toward . 
  that 's definitely a problem i 've noticed quite a bit here . 
  i 've especially noticed it with relation to australian filmmaking . 
  it seems like & mdash ; especially with young up-and-coming aussie filmmakers & mdash ; our films are just determined to relentlessly shit on themselves for the sake of a cheap laugh , instead of knowing when to take their premise seriously and treat the content with a little bit of earnestness and heart . 
   you have to hold your learners for two years, 
  aye , but op got the learners in 2012 . 
  two years was 2014 . 
  considering that if you go the normal route , you 're allowed to count hours from before your renewal , i ca n't see a good reason that op would n't be allowed to count the time before the renewal as part of the mandatory 2 years . 
  but still , my suggestion to op would be go in and ask , preferably at a different centre , * definitely * from a different staff member . 
  classical musicians are people . 
  there is doubtless much the same wide range of personalities among them as there is among ordinary folk . 
  had beethoven said this , i would guarantee it was legitimately very high praise . 
  were it said by someone a little more prim and proper , like , say , haydn , i might be more inclined to think of it as obligatory . 
  which of these shosty is , i ca n't say . 
  i do n't know much about his personal life . 
  i 'm still backing in the space knights for a win, 
  ## overall score 8.5 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 7/10, 
  the hearth domain is written in a very professional manner . 
  in nearly every case , the wording is appropriate and matches the ways in which the player 's handbook words similar features . 
  i had only one problem with wording , and that is that the names of some of the features are similar to an unfortunate degree . 
  hearthfire and hearthflame ? 
  people already get confused about the similarities of * fire bolt * and * fireball * , and there 's already enough reason to * not * get confused about those , with how different a `` bolt '' is from a `` ball '' . 
  but fire and flame are synonyms . 
  this seems tailor-made to create confusion . 
  in terms of appearance , the document leaves a lot to be desired . 
  a measly one little picture on the first page & mdash ; and admittedly , it is a very * appropriate * picture , even if it 's not an incredibly * evocative * one & mdash ; and a second page with no artwork on it at all , despite the entire second column being left empty . 
  there are also substantial problems with the typography . 
  the visual design of the words looks sickly , and kerning problems abound . 
  to point out just a handful of the kerning problems i noticed in this document :, 
  * there was no space before the em dash after `` hathor '', 
  * the numbers in `` 30 feet '' in hearthflame were weirdly tight together, 
  * also in hearthflame , `` untilyou '' looks almost like one word, 
  * `` conjure '' in divine shield , and many other uses of the letter `` j '' , squeeze the j up too close to the letter preceding it . 
  * `` 10-by - 10-feet '' in divine shield appears to have weird spacing . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9.5 / 10, 
  the theme on this is astounding . 
  i 've already mentioned that the art is n't super evocative , but it is at least theme-appropriate . 
  but more importantly , the text introducing the domain gives a very strong sense of the homeliness of the domain , and the part about how it is unusual for such a cleric to go adventuring was a very nice inclusion . 
  each of the mechanical features of the class is well-designed to reinforce the theme . 
  a lot of fire-based abilities , but ones which seem relatively low-key . 
  * produce flame * is given , not * fire bolt * , for example . 
  additionally , the gives domain spells do a fantastic job of reinforcing the idea of a cleric whose main goal is to keep herself and her loved ones safe , and creating safe homely environments . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9/10, 
  mechanically , this class option is a bit of a mixed bag . 
  it 's certainly very good , but it has a couple of odd design decisions . 
  anything i 'm not mentioning here is likely because i think it is exceptionally well-designed , so take the brevity of this section as a good thing . 
  ephemeral ward can , in theory , be used an unlimited number of times . 
  other similar abilities are usually only wis mod times ( or int/cha mod , in other classes ) . 
  it 's not an enormous problem due to the requirement to cast a spell on them ( although cantrips are * not * excluded , and so it can be used in theory limitless times ) , but for the sake of conformity and preventing any unintended consequences , i feel that a limitation to the number of times it can be used would be beneficial . 
  hearthfire does not mention how it is created . 
  does it cost you an action ? 
  does it take a minute of prayer ? 
  an hour ? 
  it does n't actually * matter * in terms of balance , but it is a mechanic that should be specified . 
  ### overview :, 
  this is a very well put together divine domain . 
  it 's clearly designed to be an * excellent * support caster mechanically , and has extremely robust flavour to back that up . 
  it 's just a shame that the damn document does n't * look * very nice . 
  fwiw humans , dragonborn , and gnomes are the phb races without darkvision . 
  `` such an important grading system '' eh ? 
  it 's your predicted grade . 
  it 's worth literally nothing . 
  your actual grade is not determined by your teacher , and it 's the one that matters . 
   the first usage to refer to a person is from 1971 , in brisbane, 
  fuck yeah cunt !, 
  yeah i did the same thing a little while ago . 
  after seeing it for weeks in my recommended , i finally caved a week or two ago to watch it . 
  so glad i did because it was a great video . 
  the channel is generally a very good one . 
  i had already seen their excellent one about `` born sexy yesterday '' but did n't realise it was the same people until afterwards . 
  and i 've since watched a bunch of their other videos . 
  using big bang theory as the example probably helped their total view count , but in my case it was the reason i * did n't * watch for so long . 
  i just do n't give a fuck about that show or its viewers . 
   good on you for taking a risk and opening your mind a little bit . 
  that 's a bit condescending is n't it ? 
  for being reluctant to watch a video with a clickbaity title about a shit tv show . 
  it does n't show any scroll bar for me . 
  they could actually release both in an eberron book . 
  psionics fits in really well with eberron , even if it is n't * quite * as * necessary * as it is in dark sun . 
  i 've seen quite a bit from the abc that i 've enjoyed , but the more independent stuff i 've seen has been the stuff marred , as you say , by `` stereotypical australiana bullshit '' .
