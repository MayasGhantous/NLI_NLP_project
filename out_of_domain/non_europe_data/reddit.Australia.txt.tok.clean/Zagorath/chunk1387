  i 'm mainly thinking of films like star wars downunder and the wizard of oz . 
  the latter of which * especially * had a really interesting premise but wasted it by not knowing when to be sincere . 
   character creation is phb-only , with the exception of one other thing, 
  it 's not even a real rule . 
  it only exists for the adventurer 's league , where it is one of many bullshit artificial restrictions . 
  it does n't apply to proper d&d games . 
   starwars downunder looks like the worst shit ive seen in my life, 
  yeah , it 's just about as bad as the trailer makes it look , lol, 
  i just realised i gave the wrong name to the other one . 
  it 's called the wizards of aus . 
  just for what it 's worth , i think most of what the other guy said was great feedback . 
  however , i would say i quite strongly disagree with the `` do n't have cha mod number of times you can use it '' . 
  that 's quite a common basic mechanic in the game and there 's nothing wrong with using it . 
  history proficiency is totally fine . 
  expertise feels a little less appropriate , but is n't * terrible * to include . 
  i like your reasoning for the choice of weapon proficiencies , but it 's a mechanic that no one has used anywhere before , and the flavour of vampires is such that there really are only a handful of weapons that make sense to use . 
  out of the martial weapons , rapiers and longswords are most appropriate , maybe short swords and crossbows . 
  i ca n't ever envisage a vampire wielding a maul or a great axe . 
  cool , good change . 
  awesome, 
  i 'm a little confused . 
  you 've remove the small bit of flavour that you had there , * before * you have something to replace it with ? 
  what you already had was n't * bad * , it just did n't go far * enough * in my opinion . 
  i might suggest changing tunnel fighter to enable * one * opportunity attack to be made per round without expending a reaction . 
  cool, 
  if your vampires are substantially different from what people are going to expect vampires to be like , yes , you ** really ** need to explain that upfront . 
  personally , the * main * reason i 'm interested in a vampire player option is for the beguiling stuff . 
  if they lack that , i need to know upfront because without it , i lose all interest in the class . 
  for others , the transformation might be just as important ( personally , i 've never particularly cared for that aspect , but it certainly is a core part of the cultural understanding of vampires today ) . 
  incidentally , your flavour change here also helps explain the fact that the claw attacks are such a core part of the class , whereas previously that decision befuddled me . 
  i 'm gon na run some maths . 
  assume the vampire 's charisma is +4 , and they 're at level 13 ( prof +5 ) . 
  their save dc , if it was 8 + prof + cha , is 17 . 
  let 's also assume the target 's con is +2 , and they are not proficient in con saves , but their proficiency is +3 . 
  the vampire 's chance of success under your system is 85 % . 
  under my suggestion , the vampire 's chance of success would only be 70 % . 
  [ ( proof here . 
  ) ] ( http://anydice.com/program/d0c7 ) so if your goal is to make it harder for the vampire , my suggestion is the way to go . 
  regardless , i feel that purely from a mechanical design perspective , using saving throws here is better . 
  if need be , you can change the formula by which the save dc is calculated . 
  it 's a capstone !, 
  you do n't need to worry * too * much about it being overpowered !, 
  fair enough, 
  i 'd love to give you a suggestion , but if i had any ideas i 'd have shared them in the previous comment . 
  i certainly do think that some kind of charming feature would be appropriate . 
  a minor charming effect might also be a decent idea for a 3rd level ability , now that i think about it . 
  possibly an alteration to the * friends * cantrip ( which the subclass would be automatically granted ) , much like how the arcane trickster gets an alteration on * mage hand * . 
  my problem with dominative acquisition is n't so much the level at which it 's gained as it is that it 's a mechanic that i ca n't see myself wanting to ever really use . 
  or at least , the cases where i * would * want to use it are so rare that it should be at best treated as a ribbon feature in addition to something more substantive . 
  just saw in my new tab page in chrome, 
   ask more of your phone . 
  oct. 5 . 
  you know what more i can ask of my phone , google ? 
  that it have the ability to play audio out of my headphones . 
  i can ask * even more * than that by asking that my phone be able to use my headphones as an fm radio antenna . 
  so , r/android , what more would you ask of your phone ? 
  use facebook messenger for your communication rather than a single-platform application . 
   edit : math was off, 
  it 's like the star wars prequels . 
  the movies were nowhere near as good , but the composer did just as fine a job on the prequels as the originals . 
  hey , i 've applied an appropriate flair to this post for you , but in the future , please remember to apply an appropriate flair to your submissions .

  click the little `` flair '' button underneath your post , after it has been submitted . 
  then click on the flair you want , and hit `` save '' . 
  include enough information in the title that our automod script can automatically apply the correct flair . 
  text such as `` fighter archetype '' or `` adventure '' in the title will apply the `` subclass '' or `` adventure '' flair , respectively .

  leave a comment on your post consisting of nothing but the flair you want , in square brackets . 
  for example , if you had commented ` [ spell ] ` , this would have been automatically flaired `` spell '' . 
   i despise the current phb dragonborn, 
  aww :(, 
  how come ? 
  is it the flavour you do n't like or the mechanics ? 
  i imagine the majority of people start this wednesday ( 02.05 ) , but maybe some start later . 
  i finish with french b on 22.05 . 
  what about all of you ? 
  first official ib exam is today , can all the redditors on twitter get #ib trending in `` honour '' of the occasion ? 
  i mean , what is the point in doing a closed book exam on literature ? 
  why would you expect students to memorise sets of poems , or passages from plays/prose ? 
  also , what is your school doing for your language a1 paper 2 ? 
  i 'm fairly new to the game , got a character on day 121 , and i have -2 honor , from something i did early in the game that i do n't remember . 
  i 've tried rescuing villages and not accepting the money , multiple times . 
  i recently captured an army 's king and accepted the bounty the moment it was given . 
  i do n't know what else i can do to get my honour up . 
  playing m&b warband . 
  tl ; dr , playing warband , how do i increase honour ? 
  whenever i attempt to go to http://imgur.com/ i get an `` access restricted '' message claiming that my computer has been infected . 
  ( i 'd post screenshots , but i do n't know a good alternative , and this is n't the kind of thing i want to use my flickr for . ), 
  i 'm getting this on both my windows xp desktop ( both chrome and ie ) and my mac laptop on os x 10.7 ( in chrome , safari , and firefox ) . 
  on windows i 've updated and scanned with spybot s&d , and am currently running a scan ( after having updated ) with mse , although i do n't expect anything to turn up . 
  the site is giving me a captcha and the option to submit an `` optional message for site owner '' , but i do n't trust it enough to have tried this yet . 
  oddly , i do n't seem to have problems with using the little plus icon from the main page , or even on clicking links like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpzam.jpg ) from the front page right now . 
  it does n't work if i click on an album , although i can use the + icon to browse through them that way . 
  [ ] ( / solved ), 
  over the last few weeks , i have been having troubles with my internet connection . 
  i first noticed it because whatpulse popped up a message saying it could not connect to the server , and since then i have noticed problems connecting to various other services . 
  my internet is set up as follows :, 
  what comes in from the wall connects to a device ( i think a modem ) that was supplied by the isp . 
  from there a single ethernet cable goes to a wireless router .
