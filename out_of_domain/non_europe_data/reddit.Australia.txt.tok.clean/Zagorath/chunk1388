  my desktop , running windows xp -- which is the computer i 'm having these problems with -- is connected via an ethernet cable from the wireless router . 
  my macbook pro , connected via wifi , does n't seem to have the same problems , although whatpulse is the only programme that does n't work on my windows computer which i have on my mac . 
  i use 8.8.8.8 as my dns , with 8.8.4.4 as the alternate dns . 
  i have , however , tried some other settings that i 've found online , as well as going with the auto option . 
  none of these helped . 
  below is a list of various things that do work, 
  good :, 
  * bittorrent ( utorrent ), 
  * normal browsing, 
  * youtube ( but often very slow ), 
  * steam ( downloading games , syncing files ), 
  * dropbox, 
  bad :, 
  * whatpulse ( i have on my mac , and it does work ), 
  * flyff ( their normal download , a few hundred kb which then fetches the actual programme will not connect , when downloading the full programme , about 1 gb , from a mirror it downloads, 
  * lord of the rings online ( through steam : i have downloaded once , but as it took so long , including many resumes after shutting the computer down i am currently in the process of downloading again in case it was corrupted or something ), 
  i 'm located in vietnam , if that makes any difference . 
  i 've thought of port forwarding as a possible solution , but i do n't have a clue where i would begin to do that , and i do n't know if it could potentially help . 
  dear america , many of us from other developed countries ( europe , australia , etc. ), 
  often look down on/make fun of you for using old units based on the imperial units , such as miles/feet/inches , gallons ( though different to the imperial gallon ) , and the fahrenheit temperature scale . 
  can any of you defend this practise , and give an explanation as to why you think americans refuse to update ( whether or not you personally agree ) . 
  note , i am genuinely curious as to why this is , i 'm not trying to attack or berate americans for it , although it may seem like that . 
  after a short while of fairly rough travel , when i tried to open my macbook pro ( which had just had the lid closed over the previous few days when it was not being used ) , the screen was completely frozen . 
  it took a while , but i managed to get it to shut down completely . 
  when i turned it back on , it at first seemed to be starting up correctly , but then instead of the apple logo , i got a flashing grey folder with a question mark in it . 
  from here i left it for a week or so , as i was away from home for that time . 
  after getting back , i tried all the solutions on [ this ] ( http://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/mac-stalls-on-gray-screen-at-startup.htm ) page , up until and including reset the pram and smc . 
  after that , i tried booting while holding command + r , which seemed to try to boot from the internet , as it took a few hours an had a spinning globe icon , as though it was downloading . 
  at the end of this it seemed to be starting the mountain lion install process ( i previously only had lion on , but would 've been updating soon anyway , so it 's not a problem ) , but when it came time to select an install drive , none were available . 
  the spot was blank . 
  next i got out the snow leopard install disk my mac came with and tried installing off that , but the same problem : no drives were available to install on . 
  i also at some point got a look at disk utility , but it was not showing my full hard drive , only one small partition thy i assume is lion 's recovery partition . 
  * now , i realise the hard drive is probably dead and will need replacing * , but as i was incredibly lax and did not have a back up , i 'm wondering if there 's any way to get the data off the drive . 
  if possible at home , but if t ca n't be done from here i understand , just need suggestions of what to do . 
  ** tl ; dr ** mbp hard drive died , tried a few fixes that did n't work ( it was n't entirely obvious that the drive was dead at first ) . 
  ( what ways ) can i get data back ?

  ours is the only instrument in the standard modern orchestra which is capable of vibrato , but which does n't use it in standard repertoire . 
  so , i was wondering what you guys think of this ? 
  do you think absolutely no vibrato should be used at all , or perhaps a little depending on context ? 
  or maybe do you think that clarinets should use vibrato freely ? 
  what about jaw vs. diaphragm vibrato ? 
  personally , i can only do jaw , but i 'd love to be able to also do diaphragm vibrato . 
  what contexts would you say warrant which type of vibrato , or none at all ? 
  would you use it ( or , rather , say it should be used ) in classical period pieces like mozart ? 
  or romantic period like brahms or weber ? 
  perhaps it gets a bit less clear in the 20th century , especially with jazz clarinet , or jazz-inspired ones like rhapsody in blue or the copland concerto . 
  also , what about solo pieces ( such as concertos , sonatas ) compared to ensemble ( quintets ) or orchestra ( in a symphony , or as part of the orchestra in a concerto ) : would you use vibrato differently in them ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** when , and in what type of pieces would you use vibrato , and what sort of vibrato ? 
  my questions stem from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/10eclt/not_sure_if_im_a_republican_anymore/c6ct12j ) here , between / u/daystareld and / u/speakmouthwords, 
   my problems with johnson personally are the same i have with all libertarians :, 
  1 ) they support the economically unsound `` low taxes = growth ! '', 
  policies that make them no different from conservatives . 
  2 ) they are ridiculously naive when it comes to issues like the environment and healthcare . 
  `` people will just be responsible '' is not an effective form of pollution control . 
  `` neighbors will take care of eachother '' is not the way to ensure a healthy citizenry . 
  their answer to everything is `` deregulation , deregulation , deregulation , '' and such absolutist , one-size-fits-all problem solving is dangerous in someone who wants to run a government to me . 
  are they better on civil rights issues and foreign affairs than republicans ? 
  yeah . 
  but that 's not saying much . 
  ultimately i 'd vote for gary johnson over mitt romney , but again ... not saying much . 
  mouthwords :, 
   your problem with libertarianism is that you have n't read up on it enough . 
  i 'll grant you your first point if you really truly do n't believe that freeing up capital for investment could create more growth . 
  economics is economics , you know ? 
  put 5 economists in a room and get 7 different answers . 
  however , your second point just kind of shows that you do n't really know much about what you 're talking about at all . 
  pop over to / r/libertarian [ 1 ] and make a thread airing those grievances , and we 'd be happy to explain . 
  my own questions are as follows :, 
  my understanding is that libertarians want to spend less on healthcare and education , two areas that the us is already amazingly behind ( i do n't know about spending at all , but in quality ) many other developed countries . 
  while i think their social policies are amazing , their economics just does n't make sense to me . 
  assuming daystar 's comment is correct ( and based on what i already understood , then i see no reason to think it is n't ) , and they also do n't want to do anything to prevent pollution and climate change , that 's another policy that really just does n't make sense . 
  could someone try to explain to me what exactly the benefits of the libertarian approaches in the areas of education , healthcare , and the environment are ? 
  also , based on / u/grapedrank77 's [ comment here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/10eclt/not_sure_if_im_a_republican_anymore/c6ctcli ), 
   libertarianism seems to stem from a sort of social darwinism ; that people will either sink or swim and it is of no concern to the rest of society which of those outcomes eventually obtains, 
  how accurate is this assessment , and , more importantly , why do you consider it to be that way ( especially if you disagree with it , as i think you likely will ) ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** what are the benefits of the libertarian approach to healthcare , education , and the environment ? 
  what do you think of the claim that libertarianism stems from `` a sort of social darwinism '' ? 
  edit : also , i have absolutely no knowledge of libertarian stances on foreign policy . 
  could anyone give me the basics on that ? 
  i 'm wondering if anyone knows of a way of making it so that i can type , for example / r/chrome into the omnibar and have it take me to http://reddit.com/r/chrome . 
  i would prefer it if there was a way to do this from the browser 's search engine settings , but any other method ( such as an extension ) is great too . 
  about the ** audio ** on the gopro hero 3 :, 
  gopro 's website makes the claim that they 've put a lot of attention into making the audio on all the new models really good quality . 
  can anyone confirm this or give a good comparison between the hero 3 , hero 2 , and some dslrs ?
