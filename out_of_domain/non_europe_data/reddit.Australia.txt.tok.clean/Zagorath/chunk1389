  about ** accessories **, 
  the hero 2 came in three packages , each with a variety of different accessories ( the outdoor package , for example , had a helmet strap , head mount , and some others ) . 
  as far as i can tell this is n't the case for the hero 3 . 
  their site does seem to say it has a waterproof housing , but is this the one for shooting underwater or is it just the same one that came with the previous cameras that protects against water but ca n't focus underwater ? 
  in addition , the site says that hero 3 models come with `` assorted mounts and hardware '' , what does that mean ? 
  does it include any of the mounts on [ this page ] ( http://gopro.com/camera-mounts ) , like the head strap , chest mount , handlebar , or suction cup mounts ? 
  what 's audio like compared to hero 2 and compared to low-end dslrs, 
  what mounts come with the hero 3 ? 
  this may have been going on for some time , but since i get quite a lot of comment karma but very little link karma i do n't notice it . 
  at the moment nk is reporting 2 link karma , when i 've submitted two links since the last reset , one of which has 6 and the other has 1 ( i.e. , no upvotes other than my own ) . 
  the upvotes on the former have been there for the past 15 minutes at least ( i have nk set to refresh every 10 minutes ) . 
  i do n't know if this is because of the weird way in which reddit deals with karma numbers , or if it 's my internet connection , or something else . 
  by the way , a `` refresh now '' option would be handy . 
  edit : title should say ** bugged ** numbers , not bugger ... 
  it 's obviously a bit more difficult with classical music than modern music , because of multi-movement works and the like , as well as due to multiple recordings of the same piece . 
  so , out of interest , in your library what is the longest single * file * you have ? 
  no rules to this part . 
  what is the longest combined single `` piece '' of music ? 
  symphonies , concertos , tone poems , masses and the like all count here , but let 's not count ballet or opera , or song cycles which are made up of multiple different pieces . 
  and finally , what is the longest work ? 
  in this case you can include song cycles , ballets , operas , and anything you have in your library . 
  for all sections , ideally i 'd like to say it only counts if it 's at a tempo that is not considered * too * extreme , but really that 's not too important . 
  post the conductor , orchestra , and others if you know them !, 
  for me , it 's scheherazade ( 45m36s , one file ) , kullervo ( 1h20m ) , and swan lake ( 2h45m ) . 
  my friend needs to analyse the music of a film for a music av class , but ca n't decide on a film to use . 
  she knows she does n't want it to be a super popular one ( lord of the rings , star wars , etc. 
  ) , but instead a film that is a good film , and has good music , but one that is not so well known either in general or at least not known for its music . 
  what are your favourite less popular films with awesome soundtracks , or more popular films with awesome soundtracks that you believe have underrated music ?

  let me just preface this by saying sorry that it does n't technically fit the idea of `` classical '' music , but in my experience many classical fans also like film soundtracks , particularly those of similar styles to john williams . 
  if the mods think this is inappropriate please let me know and i 'll remove it .

  what game was it , maybe give some context for those who do n't know , and then what decision did you make and why ? 
  did you regret the decision or were you happy with it ? 
  to try and avoid spoilers , it would be helpful to put the name of the game in ** bold ** at the top of the comment and continue the rest of it on a new line . 
  if you go to [ @classicalm ] ( https://twitter.com/classicalm ) on twitter , there 's a button in the top right that looks like a person with a downward arrow next to it . 
  click that , then click report for spam . 
  after all , that 's exactly what this twitter account is , so if a large number of people report it as such hopefully that will make a difference . 
  i 'd probably recommend * not * creating an account if you do n't already have one , since there 's a chance twitter may have some sort of system in place to recognise that . 
  what movies have you seen that one could almost expect a sequel , but where so bad that the sequel thankfully never happened ? 
  i despise adblockers on principle , as i recognise that the only way websites are able to be free in many cases is by serving ads to their users . 
  however , there are some sites that take this too far , and so i 've recently installed adblock plus in chrome in order to block these . 
  my problem is that now i have to whitelist every site i visit other than those few i have problems with ( and the problem is , i frequently forget to do this ) , and i would rather it be the other way around : i block ads manually on certain sites of my choosing while all other sites are allowed to show ads . 
  does anyone know a chrome extension that can block ads based on a user-generated blacklist ? 
  currently i 'm using sparrow as my email client , because i just love the way it works with gmail . 
  however , because it, 
  a ) has a different interface , and does n't have all the features of gmail, 
  and b ) is n't going to be updated anymore, 
  i 'm looking for a good way to use gmail itself while offline , in much the same way i can access google drive or calendar while offline ( i.e. , with the exact same interface and up to date as of the last time i opened that page with a connection , both without me doing anything other than simply visiting the page as normal ) . 
  at the moment , it seems the only way to get offline gmail is through the gmail offline chrome application , which has the terrible mobile interface , and seems to have unreliable sync . 
  the worst thing about it , however , is that i have to specifically go to the `` gmail offline '' app , rather than simply typing gmail.com, 
  does anyone know of any way that this could be done , and if not , does anyone else have the same issue as me and would like to see it be possible ? 
  i 'm trying to set up gmail to automatically check mail from my uq account ( @uq.net . au ) , using gmail 's `` check mail from other accounts ( using pop3 ) '' feature on the `` accounts and import '' tab of the settings . 
  i 've already set up gmail to be able to send from my uq address , but ca n't get the mail checking to work . 
  i go through the process following the prompts , entering the email address ( which i found by sending myself an email from the uq outlook web app ) , and then on the next page entering my password and selecting a label to be attached to them . 
  i 've tried changing the user name from the default ( my name with dots between it ) , to the student number , both the one beginning with the s , and the one that does n't . 
  however , every time i get the same error :, 
   server returned error : `` we were unable to locate the other domain . 
  please contact your other provider . '', 
  do i need to change the pop server ( default `` mail.uq.net.au '' ) , or the port ( default 110 ) ? 
  or am i doing something else wrong ? 
  ** edit ** : actually , looking through the settings i found the necessary pop server and port settings . 
  however , now i 'm getting a new error :, 
   server denied pop3 access for the given username and password . 
   server returned error : `` logon failure : unknown user name or bad password . '', 
  i know i 'm typing the same password i use for mysi-net and my.uq , and i 've again tried all three potential usernames ( my name , number beginning with s , and the number that does n't begin with s but has an additional digit at the end ) . 
  and what was one of the biggest things you noticed when you first got them ? 
  does anyone have the exact questions ? 
  i 've done it , but would like to go back and see a couple of the questions again . 
  specifically , q22 ( gas law , something about pipes ) and q24 ( conservation of mass ) . 
  it asks to translate things where there 's no translation to be had ( like the picture there ) , but also regularly misses the translation when it 's blindingly obvious the text is n't in my set language , for example it uses a completely different script . 
  not to mention , bing translate is not even in the same universe as google , quality-wise , when it comes to doing the translation once facebook decides a translation is in order . 
  today we had a talk from a guy from citg , and he told us that for mac the software you need is shakespeer , and i think the windows one was bcdc . 
  i 've downloaded it , but ca n't figure out how to configure it to actually access the dc stuff . 
  can anyone walk me through it ? 
  is there any way to get punctuation in the voice recognition in android ? 
  so far i 've managed to get commas , exclamation marks , question marks , and even semicolons , but not colons , or even the most basic of punctuation marks : the full stop . 
  also on the no list are brackets and quotation marks . 
  yes : ( '' , '' '' ? '', 
  i 'm wondering if anyone knows a way i can get at least some of these in , perhaps through some sort of an add-on ? 
  would also be nice to be able to say `` enter '' or `` newline '' and have it go to a new line . 
  additionally , i 'm interested in knowing what google now can do via voice input , but i ca n't find a list of its commands anywhere . 
  so for i 've found it can `` remember '' something , which will add it to evernote , keep , or gmail ( out of the apps i have ) , but i ca n't find a proper list of the voice commands in jellybean 4.2 . 
  does anyone know where i can find a proper , reliable list ? 
  at the moment i 've got a few other commands that work , but i ca n't get it to play any music , it will only open certain apps , and i do n't know what other features i may be missing out on . 
  finally , is there a way to activate voice commands in google now without pressing on the mic icon ? 
  i would have thought saying something like `` phone '' , or `` google '' would activate it , but that does n't seem to work . 
  tl ; dr is there any way to get punctuation marks like full stop ? 
  where can i see a list of all available voice commands to google now ? 
  i 'm using magnetometers for a uni project , and need two connected to a single arduino . 
  i 've never worked with arduinos before , so i 'm not entirely sure how it works , but unlike some of the other sensors we 've got , the [ hmc5883l ] ( http://bildr.org/2012/02/hmc5883l_arduino/ ) sample code does n't have a place for which port it 's connected to . 
  all it has is a simple import of the library , and then declaring the compass as a variable by saying, 
  near the top , and then, 
  in the setup ( ) method .
