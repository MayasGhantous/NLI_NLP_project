  yes , that would be a better solution . 
  cheers . 
  i feel like it probably would 've been downvoted if it were nsfl , but yeah , me too . 
  did n't notice the username until i read your comment . 
  i was getting a pretty useable connection on a shitty 3rd gen ipod touch ( relevant because it often does n't get connections when newer devices would ) from the far side of the roundabout at sir fred schonell and coleridge today . 
  awesome !, 
  now if only someone would make a piano reduction haha . 
  they do n't seem like they 'd be too difficult , i might do one myself at some point . 
  if i do i 'll be sure to share it here . 
  side note this guy is awesome , i ca n't believe i 've never heard of him before !, 
  he also did the ( awesome ) music for democracy 2 , and he 's released at least one of his pieces as public domain !, 
  i do n't know if there 's such a thing , but there needs to be . 
  although i would rather it was `` view in explorer/finder '' than open the file . 
  yeah , i do the same thing . 
  either that , or i just forget i 've downloaded it already . 
  the reason i , personally , would prefer it to view in finder is just in the situations that i forget i 've already got it , i may not want it open straight away , especially if it 's a really large pdf . 
  definitely should be an option to do it either way , though . 
  side note , does anyone know if this is even possible ? 
  i 'm not sure it would be on account of sandboxing or something ... 
  but now you 're dismissing his argument completely based on the fact that he used fallacious reasoning . 
  that is , in itself , an argument from fallacy . 
  my head hurts . 
  wow . 
  wow , wow , wow . 
  this was awesome , thanks !, 
  episode ii is probably my favourite of the star wars film scores . 
  that amazing love theme , the gradual introduction of darth vader 's theme , it 's just stunning . 
  i tried reading the instructions , but could n't read step 4 . 
  anyone have any more luck than me ? 
  by the way , i believe [ this is the creator 's page ] ( http://www.calebheisey.com/new-virtuoso ), 
  each player picks a playing piece and places it on ** da capo ** . 
  in the determined sequence , a player rolls the dice to calculate the number of spaces moved ... ... ... ... . . , 
  once moved , an opposing player picks a card and reads either a ** question ** or ** ? 
  instructions ** . 
  the first player to ** al fine ** and successfully auditions another player wins the game and becomes ** the virtuoso ** . 
  i do n't understand step 5 , really , either , but i imagine you 'd have to see the actual cards to get it . 
  i really wan na see some sample questions and instructions !, 
  is that woo-sh , or wo-osh ? 
  i dunno if i 'd say `` i would have hated '' it , but it 's definitely a nicer experience at the theatre . 
  giant screen , awesome audio , dark room . 
  only downside is all the people often talking or making noise . 
  i do n't know about you , but the amount of movies i watch would never make buying that equipment cheaper , or even close to the same price as going to a movie theatre . 
  yeah , i realised that . 
  i was trying to make a joke . 
  guess it fell flat . 
  pinch-zoom works for me . 
  i 'm certainly not aware of any extensions that i 've got doing it . 
  it does n't work smoothly , however , and moves in discrete intervals . 
  what i 'd like to see is two-finger double-taping to zoom into a particular element . 
  i guess i 'm a shit designer , but the flag you posted on the words `` same issue '' looks fucking awesome to me . 
  i love the idea of the tino rangatiratanga design just to piss off talkback listeners , but personally i do n't think i would want it if i were from nz . 
  i feel the flag should incorporate some of the traditional heritage , but also something from the more modern culture and society ( e.g. -- and i do mean * e.g. 
  * , it could equally be some other cultural aspect -- your silver fern or our green and gold ) . 
  i take it this is u.s. only ? 
  due to the use of gpa out of 4 and the words `` freshman '' , `` senior '' , and the like . 
  i thought it was never the same without gervais . 
  although i could n't do it in a proper sentence haha . 
  a lot of multi-movement works contain varying emotions between movements , but i suspect that was n't what you were after . 
  alternatively , due to the nature of what they are , nearly anything with rhapsody in its title probably contains a variety of emotions . 
  the best example of this , though , is probably [ rhapsody on a theme of paganini , by rachmaninov ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orp4dlwnskm ) . 
  you 've probably heard the theme before ( starts at 0:30 in the violins ) , and also the 18th variation , which is often used as a love theme . 
  both movements [ 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5celmirpizw ) and [ 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lktflwvemzo ) of beethoven 's path\u00e9tique sonata could be described as containing a variety of emotions within the movement . 
  honestly , depending on how you interpret it nearly any piece could be said to contain a wide variety of emotions . 
  the ones i 've named are just the first that popped into my mind . 
  my point was it should incorporate maori as well as western ideas . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  out of interest , in a three-year programme , what do you call the years ? 
  i would guess sophmore would be the one to go , but i 'm not sure . 
  based on [ the last thread about this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/177yc6/concept_behind_ausflag/ ) , i 'd say not . 
  one hitler shall henceforth be a unit of measurement equal to 6.0 * 10 ^ 6 human deaths . 
  standard si prefixes apply . 
  thus harold shipman 's achievements amount to 36 microhitlers . 
  the true utility of the hitler as an si unit is it allows useful unit conversions . 
  for example : the epa currently values a human life as being worth 6.9 million us dollars ( 6.9 megadollars ) . 
  a simple unit conversion thus gives us 1 hitler is equivalent to -41,400,000,000,000 dollars . 
  it can therefore be quantitatively established whether or not someone is `` worse than hitler '' . 
  when congress failed to pass a stimulus bill in 2008 the market lost 1.2 trillion dollars in 1 day , roughly equivalent to 29 millihitlers . 
  joseph stalin is the only human i know of who can be called worse than hitler , as his achievements clocked roughly 5 hitlers . 
  when your bank nails you with a 35 dollar fine , you can confidently tell the teller that they are currently fucking you over to the tune of 84 picohitlers and ask if they have a very tiny auschwitz behind the counter . 
  ^ not my own creation, 
  my experience has been that on reddit this is a fairly controversial idea . 
  i see a lot of hate against bodies like the un specifically because they are , or ( supposedly ) attempt to be , a `` world government '' . 
  but you make a really interesting point , and one that i 've never thought of before . 
  that would indeed seem to be the general trend ; one towards larger and larger systems of governance . 
  in his defense , that it was a joke was n't clear . 
  still , nearly every time someone complains about people complaining about downvotes , it 's the person complaining about the complaint that comes across like a douche , not the person complaining about downvotes . 
  this was no exception , even if you did miss the joke . 
  except for the times it does work . 
  i do n't get that . 
  why can i sometimes successfully get into offline mode , but sometimes this fucking error appears ? 
  could it be something about different locations being sent to the server ? 
  possibly the cost is different in different places . 
  yeah , i got ta admit i 've never heard of prices being different based on prior history . 
  i 'd be really interested to be pointed to any articles about it actually happening . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for centralisation in the right areas . 
  i believe australian states , for example , have far too much power , leading to confusing differences and inefficiencies in areas such as education , police , and medicine . 
  ( and , as an outsider , it seems to me that your states have an absolutely absurd amount of power . ), 
  conversely , i do n't think i want my federal government ( let alone a world government ) to be wasting its time in charge of my rubbish bin emptying on a weekly basis . 
  similar to your point , moving to more tightly packed areas has other massive benefits , such as more efficient/cheaper public transportation , less petrol used due to shorter commutes , and less need for as much mobile/cell tower infrastructure . 
  i * wish * my university made me pay absurd prices for these ( although i already have an 84 + from high school ) .
