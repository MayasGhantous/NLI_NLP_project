  how can i set it up so that both sensors can work with the arduino at once ? 
  [ here ] ( http://pastie.org/7947839 ) 's the code i 've got so far to work with one of them . 
  it 's only a simple variation on the included sample code so far , though . 
  i 've had nothing but problems with java on os x. 
  i ca n't get minecraft to display properly because it complains about not having a 64-bit version of java . 
  i ca n't get java applets in chrome to work ( would take this issue to / r/chrome were it not for minecraft also not working properly ) . 
  for example [ this one ] ( http://www.wordle.net/create ) . 
  any suggestions ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'm listening to abc classic fm on the radio at the moment -- they 're playing a performance of beethoven symphony no. 1 -- and the announcer gave an introduction to it involving some talk about how at the time the orchestras would have been run by the head violinist and a keyboard player . 
  i was n't paying particular attention to it . 
  he mentioned that beethoven had particular interest in the piano as the head of the orchestra ( or something like that , again , i was n't paying attention ) . 
  this version of beethoven 's 1st has a piano in the background , kinda just playing along at bits . 
  it 's by no means a soloist , it seems just like an extra instrument added to the background of the orchestra . 
  no score that i could find , and no googling that i did , had any information to back up this rather unique performance . 
  my recording of the piece does n't include piano ( as far as i know ... will have to go back and check ) . 
  so my question is , is this something that 's done fairly often , and is there any serious music history to back up this addition to the ensemble ? 
  the information on the website : [ geoffrey lancaster , fp ; tasmanian symphony orch/david porcelijn abc 461 917-2 24 ' 20 ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/?date=2013-05-27 ) ( yes i 'm up at 4:00 am , do n't judge me !, 
  i 'm looking at crusader kings ii for mac , and the wikipedia article mentions that it was made in-house , which initially made me think it was therefore a native version to os x ( i.e. , not running in wineskin or something ) . 
  looking into it , however , all the references seem to mention wineskin . 
  what makes me confused , is they seem to be talking about it as though they have the ` wineskin version ' of it , somewhat implying that there may be another version that * is * native . 
  so what is it ? 
  what calculator from the [ approved calculator ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/myadvisor/exam-calculators ) list would you guys recommend ? 
  in particular , i 'd be really glad to know if one has the following features :, 
  * convert complex numbers between polar and rectangular form, 
  * scroll up through previous equations , especially to select and re-use results ( in a manner similar to pressing the `` up '' button on my ti-84 ), 
  * store results in variables ( e.g. , perform calculation , press `` store '' `` a '' , and later press `` a '' to recall that value ), 
  and as a bit of a stretch goal , would be nice to have but i do n't think it very likely , return values as surds and/or multiples of pi . 
  i was reading [ this article on the pirate party website ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/2013/08/18/preferencing-statement-for-federal-election-2013/#australian-democrats-deal-considered-null-and-void ) about how they organised their preference deals on the group voting tickets , and it got me really confused . 
  i 've heard a lot about how the australian democrats are trying to make a come back , and been linked many times to http://australiandemocrats.org.au as their party website , including at least once by someone who said he was a member of that party . 
  this is the site that the pirate party says they went through when working out preference deals initially , and the struck out preference orders on that page match with the official aec group voting ticket [ here ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/election/qld/files/qld-gvt.pdf ) ( for qld , at least ) . 
  it 's the one that i know i was using when previously deciding my voting preferences . 
  however , the pirate party is now saying ( at least if i 've got it correct ) that the people they were making deals with were not , in fact , officially registered as the australian democrats with the aec . 
  they say the first listed website for the australian democrats ( the one linked above ) is not the official one , which leads me to assume that it must be http://australian-democrats.org.au , which is the next site down that purports to be the official ausdem site . 
  the former site is the only one that seems actively represented in social media , with both the [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/ausdemocrats ) and [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/ausdemocrats ) pages having the logo of the first link . 
  only by searching more deeply could i come up with [ this twitter page ] ( https://twitter.com/gwsdems ) and [ this facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/saaustraliandemocrats ) , neither of which seems especially official , but no others . 
  australiandemocrats is the one linked on [ below the line ] ( http://www.belowtheline.org.au/state/qld.html ) , but australian-democrats is linked on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_democrats ) . 
  australiandemocrats is clearly the one more involved in social media and has a more clearly presented set of policies , but the party correspondence address on the [ aec register ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/party_registration/registered_parties/aust-dem.htm ) matches with the [ australian-democrats ] ( http://australian-democrats.org.au/contact.php ) south australia contact details ( but notably not the national headquarters ) . 
  ### in summary , it would appear that the official website of the australian democrats is http://australian-democrats.org.au , not the one that has been linked many times , however there still seem to be inconsistencies . 
  i for one will most likely to altering my preferences to exclude the australian democrats entirely ( by which i mean placing them below both alp and lnp ) . 
  the party that seems to be public facing most likely does not actually exist , and the party that does exist has no real presence . 
  a question to / r/australianpolitics , do the pirate party have the ability now to change the way their preferences are distributed for above the line voters , or are they stuck putting them in second place ( or fourth in nsw and tas ) for anyone that votes above the line at this election ?

  the party that seems to be public facing most likely does not actually exist , and the party that does exist has no real presence . 
  so i came across it when it was an arena contender on the all about android podcast , and i have a few queries about it . 
  is it possible to set the weight of certain tasks ? 
  ideally i 'd like to be able to set certain habits as higher weighting than others . 
  for example , running for 40 minutes is far more of a beneficial habit than doing the washing . 
  edit : i just found out about the options to make a habit , daily , or todo easy , medium , or hard , so i guess that 's what this is . 
  ( can anyone confirm it does work in a logical way ? ), 
  the option does n't exist in the android app , though ... 
  is it possible to * undo * presses ? 
  i have accidentally pressed on things way too many times already , ~ ~ and so far i 've only really wanted to be testing things out ~ ~ ( ~ ~ can i reset it ? ~ ~ ) . 
  edit : ok , so on this point i 've found on their website myself how to do a full reset . 
  great for me for now , but not particularly useful for someone who 's been using this for ages and makes one mistake . 
  also , the button does n't even exist on the android app ... 
  what exactly is the point of dailies ? 
  compared to habits , i mean . 
  it seems to me the only difference is a daily is something you expect to/should do every day , but then why have it ? 
  ~ ~ there are n't that many things i would want to do * every * day that are worth putting in here . ~ ~ edit : i 've found out that if you create a task , and * then * press to edit it ( really should be an option while creating it , imo , but okay ... ) you can select certain days to do a task on . 
  a ** massive ** improvement . 
  would still be nice to be able to specify a number of times per fortnight . 
  and just as a side note , what advantages and disadvantages does this have over the competitor app `` life rpg '' ( if anyone knows ) ? 
  both , quite frankly , seem to have awful interfaces , and i 've noticed it has some level of weighting ( though not a very good amount of granularity ) exist on liferpg . 
  went through the `` trello '' future features thing , and here are a few of the things that i would think are most important . 
  [ expected habit frequency ] ( https://trello.com/c/cwqvdqi9/208-expected-habit-frequency ) , kinda similar to what i was describing in point 3 . 
  [ repeat every n days ] ( https://trello.com/c/xuvokk2v/108-repeat-every-n-days-weekly-monthly ) , also similar to point 3 . 
  [ priority multiplier ] ( https://trello.com/c/4c8w1z5h/17-priority-multiplier ) , seems to be exactly what i was talking about in 1 ? 
  it 's under `` revisit ( mostly done ) '' . 
  is this the actual dev saying that this feature will be implemented soon ? 
  awesome if so . 
  [ urgency/due date ] ( https://trello.com/c/i6kxvny2/106-urgency-due-dates-deadlines-expiration ) . 
  i did n't think of this problem , but it 's a fairly obvious one once it 's brought up . 
  too many edits :, 
  a lot of my problems would have been solved by ignoring the android app and only using the web interface , which is incredibly unfortunate as that would be by far the easier way to interact with something like this if it worked properly . 
  ah well . 
  so , with kevin rudd stepping down as leader of the labor party , who do you think will be the new leader ? 
  who do you think * should * be the new leader ? 
  so , yesterday was depressing , i 'm hoping maybe this wo n't be quite as bad ... 
  on qanda last night , clive palmer accused some polling stations in his seat of fairfax of having more votes in the house of representatives than for the senate . 
  he used this as a launchpad for his accusation of rigging the vote in his seat -- and possibly others . 
  now , i do n't buy into this accusation , but i 'm genuinely curious as to what the actual explanation for the difference here could be . 
  below is the message sent to people who signed the nbn petition . 
  our message is starting to get through . 
  after signing our petition , thousands of people have taken further action : emailing mr turnbull , contacting him on twitter and sharing images asking him to open up the debate on the nbn . 
  and the media interest has n't let up -- we 've had press and radio coverage across the country !, 
  it was clear from mr turnbull 's first response to the petition that he wo n't be moved easily , but that he 's willing to engage . 
  in fact , in a second response , he 's now entered into a debate with an academic from queensland and , seemingly , promised two things :, 
  1 - that the share of the nbn that 's fttp will be up for discussion , and,
