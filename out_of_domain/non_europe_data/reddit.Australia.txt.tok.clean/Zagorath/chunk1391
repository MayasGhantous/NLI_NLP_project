  2 - that the strategic review will be conducted openly . 
  in the last few days , nick 's received hundreds of emails with ideas and comments about what we should do next . 
  ( sorry if you have n't had a reply yet - it 's been flat out ! ), 
  there 's been loads of great ideas but we want to get a clearer picture of who makes up our movement and what you think we should do next . 
  [ can you take a few minutes to fill out this survey , let us know a bit about yourself and give us your thoughts on the campaign by clicking here ? 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/a/change.org/forms/d/1rmhxvvnev5o9b5m0_i4nb5odh2bvsqfonkamxhzqeyk/formresponse ), 
  we 've started something here , and you 're part of it . 
  but if we 're going to keep getting movement out of mr turnbull , we 'll need to step it up another notch , and start doing things like talking with our local mps and asking them to advocate on our behalf . 
  [ what other ideas do you have for continuing this campaign ? 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rmhxvvnev5o9b5m0_i4nb5odh2bvsqfonkamxhzqeyk/viewform ), 
  thanks for everything you 've done so far , we 're really starting to get somewhere ,, 
  alex, 
  ( filling in for nick while he 's offline for a couple of days ), 
  we 're still worried that mr turnbull thinks we do n't understand . 
  [ if you have n't already , why not respond by clicking here and commenting on his blog . 
  ] ( http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/our-nbn-policy ) as always , please be polite , but take the time to explain why a better nbn matters to you . 
  well done everybody , it seems as though we may have made a difference !, 
  of course we ca n't stop now , but it seems turnbull may be getting the message . 
  i just have a couple of questions . 
  where is the source for the claim about entering in debate with an ` academic from queensland ' , and is that academic / u/routinegrounds ? 
  i must say , if they really do conduct the review openly i will be very happy . 
  it 's incredibly annoying . 
  if someone is so worried about spoilers , they probably should avoid the subreddit until they 've caught up . 
  but even more importantly , titles should simply not be allowed to contain spoilers . 
  because of how annoying this ` feature ' is , making it impossible to just scan down the page looking for interesting things , i 've turned off the subreddit style . 
  i happen to like the subreddit style otherwise , particularly the flair . 
  but even more importantly , it means that spoilers no longer get blocked in comments , which is a problem . 
  civ v and its expansions are massively on sale . 
  75 % off everything except brave new world , which is 33 % off . 
  you can get the original game for $ 17.50, 
  the gold edition ( original game + dlc + the first expansion , gods & kings ) for $ 22.50, 
  gods & kings by itself is available for $ 12.50, 
  the second expansion , brave new world is available separately for $ 33.50 . 
  side note , i 'm seeing gold edition upgrade available for $ 5.00 , which supposedly will get me everything i do n't already have from the gold edition . 
  for me that 's two of the minor dlc and gods & kings , so it should actually be cheaper to get gods & kings by getting the gold edition upgrade . 
  if you 've never played a civilisation game before , they 're turn-based strategy . 
  you play an empire , building up cities and armies , developing a variety of technologies and cultural advances , aiming to conquer the world . 
  if you 've not yet moved to civ v from civ iv or earlier , the gods and kings expansion returns religion and espionage to the game , which was missing in the original release . 
  brave new world introduces a world congress , as well as international trade routes . 
  well worth getting at least the gold edition if you 've never played a civ game before , and i 'd say now 's a good time to upgrade if you 're still playing civ iv . 
  i have a nexus 4 running stock android 4.3 , and i recently bought a pair of a-jays 1 + earphones . 
  they come with a single button + mic , and i 'm having trouble getting them to work . 
  i 've got the a-jays app and it 's set to the default controls . 
  when playing music or podcasts , i 'll press the button , and nothing will happen . 
  sometimes if i repeatedly press it , the media will pause , but it 's so unreliable it 's not worth trying . 
  if i hold the button , it will open google now , so that works just fine , and the mic also works fine . 
  i tried plugging in a pair of earphones that came with my dad 's cheap samsung phone , and the button on them has all the same problems . 
  additionally , the earphones work just fine to control itunes on my mac . 
  so the problem definitely is n't with the earphones themselves . 
  any suggestions ? 
  to those who have seen the latest two episodes , is there a noticeable difference in animation quality ? 
  is it better ? 
  no spoilers on content , though , please . 
  the episodes still are n't on the pirate bay . 
  could someone add armour to the chickens in [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0hvcyki.jpg ) . 
  no particular type of armour or specific request beyond that very general one . 
  found [ in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1pc8js/i_was_bored_my_parent_have_chickens_i_apologise/cd0y8lv?context=1 ) . 
  thanks a heap !, 
  i 'm getting an error every time i try to undertake any action whatsoever . 
   error 500 : internal server error ( see chrome console for more details ) . 
  i 've also been finding that i 'm having problems the last few days , particularly with dailies . 
  sometimes they 'll stay ticked the following day after having ticked them yesterday , sometimes they wo n't get ticked off straight away after i select them . 
  also getting :, 
   error 500 : [ object object ] ( see chrome console for more details ) . 
  when i try to add a challenge . 
  anyone else having similar issues ? 
  here 's the take of prominent youtube group rocketjump ( formerly freddiew ) on the new youtube comment section . 
  i for one find it refreshing to see a rational stance on the issue rather than the usual blind * ermegurd it 's all changed , i hate google + * that most people have been going into . 
  i ask because i just found out that arrow ( which also airs in the us on wednesdays ) is having a week off ( thanksgiving , i think ? 
  ) , so i figured there 's probably a high chance modern family will too . 
  on reddit , \\* you can use backslashes * as an escape character to enable you to use things that would otherwise be formatting ( e.g. , making them italic or bold ) . 
  i just tried that on a comment on g + and it did n't work . 
  does anyone know if there is a way of escaping in g + comments ? 
  hey there , still using narcikarma , and still loving it . 
  i wonder if perhaps the font on the numbers could be changed/changeable . 
  it can be really unclear and difficult to read at the moment . 
  for the next year at least i 'm going to have * really * low internet allowance ( 10 gb per month , excluding government , university , and google sites ) . 
  i definitely do n't want to get involved in the game only to find out i 'm going to be forced to not play for fear of running out of data for the month . 
  ( this is excluding the initial download , of course . ), 
  the gmg version of eso only has a windows logo shown above the price , although it also lists the mac minimum spec requirements . 
  i 'm just wondering if anyone knows if it will work on both os x and windows ? 
  does the information about contracts shown in [ this thread ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1yjg30/what_is_immediate_red_flag_someone_is_not_to_be/cfl9u1h ) apply in australian law ? 
  from [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/216afy/best_disguises_ever/cga7gr0?context=1 ), 
   the guy who makes a deal with the devil to play one last game when he dies, 
  does anyone know that particular story ? 
  the other two ( i linked to sir bearington , and many comments linked to the disguised paladin ) have both been posted here , but i do n't think anybody 's posted the third one . 
  i 'm just curious what the law is surrounding this . 
  is an employer allowed to ask to have you log into your facebook account for them to peruse in a job interview ? 
  if they do ask this , you refuse , and then you do n't get the job ( and suspect this may be the reason you did n't get it ) , what recourse can you take ? 
  just an extra note , i have n't actually faced this situation myself , i 'm only asking because i just had a speech from my university 's marketing and communications office , and she brought it up as something that could happen . 
  title says it all . 
  i 've got an assignment where we 've been given a static method documentation to implement , and when i 've tried making helper methods , eclipse gives me a warning `` can not make a static reference to the non-static method '' . 
  is there a way around this , or does the helper method have to be static ? 
  ( i would assume that it does , indeed , need to be static , since the method is being called without the class being instantiated , so helper methods ca n't be called unless they are also static . 
  i 'm mainly looking for someone to confirm this suspicion , or explain why i 'm wrong if i am . ), 
  edit : on the off chance anyone ever comes across this in the future and has the same problem , my issue was that the motherboard did n't support a feature windows 8 needs . 
  i upgraded the motherboard 's firmware and i was able to install it successfully .
