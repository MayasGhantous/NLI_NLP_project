  the fact that there 's intra-party conflict is n't a problem , we 've had * far * worse before and the group enjoys that aspect of it . 
  i 'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas for how to actually simulate the votes/voting preferences of all the npcs in the town . 
  my thought was to have each of the named npcs have their own opinions on whatever issues get raised in campaigning and work it out by hand , and then just roughly estimate the opinions of the unnamed populace , and allow their decisions to be swayed by how the debate goes . 
  but i was wondering if anyone could think of any specific ways to actually go about this . 
  i 've been playing around with customising the colours in my terminal . 
  my . bash_profile currently has the line ` export lscolors = gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacgx ` . 
  unfortunately , one thing that this does is that some files are bold red , and others are normal-weighted white . 
  as far as i can tell , my lscolors is making executables bold red . 
  some of the files that are appearing bold red are not executables . 
  or at least they should n't be . 
  i 've got some . pdf files that are appearing bold red , and some . sib , some . mp3 . 
  basically a bunch of normal files are appearing as though they 're executables . 
  but i can also find some . pdfs , some . sibs , and mp3s that are appearing white . 
  ** tl ; dr ** so for some reason , some data files are appearing as executables , while others are n't . 
  anyone know any way to fix this ? 
  i 've just created a hall of fame for the subreddit . 
  you can [ visit it here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  it probably does n't contain * everything * everyone would want , but i feel it 's a good start . 
  if there are are * glaring * omissions , please let me know . 
  i also created [ a style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) to teach people how to correctly use the greentext format in comments and self posts . 
  feedback on this is also appreciated .
