  i am here to announce that i am leaving the australian greens , and will be contesting the upcoming election in the electorate of brisbane & surrounds as a member of the progressives . 
  this is not a decision that i have undertaken lightly , as i have been a member of the greens since this parliament 's inception , and i was proud of what the greens were able to accomplish in such a young parliament . 
  however , the writing has been on the wall . 
  the party has been largely inactive , both in public and behind the scenes , and i felt that i could do more good in a more active party with the progressives . 
  i look forward to further contributing to progress of this great country in the future . 
  thank you . 
  zagorath , member for brisbane & surrounds, 
  since inkarnate is still in beta , and is obviously missing quite a few useful features , you can use this to help give feedback to the devs with regards to any bugs you find , or features you would like to see implemented . 
  i might just take this opportunity to plug the ideas that i personally most want to see ( you can go in there and vote for them if you want , or go find other things you want ) :, 
  * [ upload background images ] ( http://inkarnate.uservoice.com/forums/239527-general/suggestions/6286517-upload-background-image ) . 
  basically , be able to upload an image from an external source and use it as a background temporarily to trace over with . 
  personally i find it easier to do an initial design ( mainly just the outline of the land ) by hand on paper . 
  it 'd be nice to be able to scan that and upload the image into inkarnate and trace around the image , rather than needing to try and eyeball it . 
  * [ roads , resizeable objects and political borders ] ( http://inkarnate.uservoice.com/forums/239527-general/suggestions/8701159-roads-resizeable-objects-and-political-borders ) . 
  like it says : resize things like town or ship icons ; create roads ( and maybe rivers ! ), 
  that can be brushed on and off with their own layer , separate from the terrain ; and add a layer to visually represent political boundaries . 
  * [ trees should be a brush ] ( http://inkarnate.uservoice.com/forums/239527-general/suggestions/8787106-trees-should-be-a-brush ) . 
  similar to roads above , it would be nice to be able to brush trees in , rather than it placing a whole bunch of individual `` objects '' . 
  but mainly , go on there and vote for whatever it is you like , leave comments , etc. 
  i hereby invite nominations for the vacant office of deputy speaker and second deputy speaker of the house of representatives . 
  a member shall propose the nomination of a member to the vacant office by moving , without notice , that such member ` be elected deputy speaker ' or ` be elected second deputy speaker . ', 
  please comment below :, 
   mr speaker , i [ username ] move : that the [ honourable ] member / u / [ username ] , [ title ] be elected [ second ] deputy speaker .
