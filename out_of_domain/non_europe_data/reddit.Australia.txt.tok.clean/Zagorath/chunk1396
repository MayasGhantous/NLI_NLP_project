  the text is :,

  utortru tn c t, 
  it comes with the following riddle , which is part of the * intended * form of solving the puzzle , and if anyone has any clues to that it 'd be awesome , but i 'm more interested in an analytical approach to decrypting the cypher text on its own . 
   where air meets fire, 
  and land marries sea, 
  head south and east, 
  therein lies the key, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a transposition cypher , based on letter frequencies , but beyond that , i have no idea . 
  the plaintext is a spell in 5th edition d&d , which means it 's ( probably ) in the format :, 
  [ ordinal ] level [ spell school ], 
  [ description ], 
  my guess is that the [ spell school ] is * probably * either `` divination '' or `` evocation '' , based just on the fact that the cypher text has three `` v `` s in it , and there are two left after one gets used for `` level '' . 
  there 's also a well above zero chance that the first world of the title is `` elminster 's '' or `` elminster '' . 
  does anyone know any good analytical techniques for solving this sort of transposition cypher , or perhaps at least a couple of different * types * of transposition cypher it could be ? 
  thanks, 
  ## weapons, 
  name | cost | damage | weight | properties, 
  * martial melee weapons * | | | |, 
  main-gauche | 3 gp | 1d4 piercing | 2 lb . 
  | finesse , light , special, 
  ### special weapons, 
  *** this weapon may be dual-wielded with another finesse weapon , even if that weapon does not have the light property . 
  while doing so , you gain +1 to your ac against melee weapon attacks . 
  when you take the attack action with a finesse weapon that you 're holding in one hand , you can use a bonus action to attack with your main-gauche . 
  if you do so , you lose the +1 ac bonus until the start of your next turn . 
  in addition to any classes with proficiency in all martial weapons , the following classes gain proficiency with mains-gauches : bard , rogue . 
  [ here 's a formatted version ] ( http://www.naturalcrit.com/homebrew/share/njzuzo5cue ) . 
  ### some thoughts on the design :, 
  the basic idea is to have an off-hand weapon for a duelist style fighter , meant to go perfectly with a rapier . 
  it needed to have features that make it a viable option as opposed to two non-light one-handed weapons , such as you could pick if you took the dual wield feat . 
  it 's still definitely not as good as that ( the ac is only against melee , and your offhand weapon is d4 , rather than being up to d8 ) , but it does n't require spending a feat to get . 
  it 's a touch heavier than a normal dagger , as well as more expensive , due to the slightly longer blade , as well as the existence of a more protective hilt . 
  i 've also considered allowing it to benefit from the `` dueling '' fighting style ( that is , allow fighters to take the benefit of dueling even while wielding this and one other weapon ) , since flavour wise , a duelist is exactly who is most likely to take this weapon . 
  it would probably specify that one can only gain that benefit if one does * not * use the bonus action option , and that the decision must be made * before * rolling the first attack . 
  i left that out mainly because i 'm concerned about it being overpowered . 
  it 's a particularly nice option for swashbuckler rogues , since it allows them to benefit from rakish audacity with a d8 weapon , while still being able to get the full benefits of fancy footwork , allowing them to attack two enemies and get out without needing to disengage . 
  does anyone have any feedback ? 
  ways that this can be better refined ? 
  or possibly a fundamentally different way to build a main-gauche ? 
  an idiom meaning `` work it out as we go along '' , the etymology of the phrase is obviously from music , where the term means to play a piece without sheet music . 
  work out the notes purely by listening to someone else play it and copy that . 
  what i want to know is , how did it make the leap from the musical definition to the more general idiom ? 
  [ removed ], 
  so , with february already upon most of the world * , and only a few hours left in the month for the rest , it seems like there 's not going to be a survey for january . 
  or , if there was one , this subreddit missed it entirely . 
  does anyone know if there was a stated reason for the lack of a survey this month ? 
  as far as i 'm aware , this would be the first month they missed since the first one they did . 
  \\* by global population, 
  following on from [ this post ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 43sgh2/favorite _ flute_work / ) asking for your favourite flute work , i thought i 'd move down the score and ask people what their favourite oboe works are . 
  either complete solo works or moments in larger works that feature the instrument . 
  my hope is to go down the orchestral score for all the instruments , roughly one per day . 
  tomorrow : clarinets . 
  continuing the series from [ this post ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 43waer/favourite _ oboe_work / ) , what is everyone 's favourite piece for clarinet ? 
  either completely solo works like concertos and sonatas , or moments within larger works that feature the clarinet . 
  continuing the series from [ this post ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 444oms/favourite _ clarinet_work / ) , what is everyone 's favourite piece for bassoon ? 
  either completely solo works like concertos and sonatas , or moments within larger works that feature the bassoon . 
  continuing the series from [ this post ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 44bvum/favourite _ bassoon_work / ) , what is everyone 's favourite piece for horn ? 
  either completely solo works like concertos and sonatas , or moments within larger works that feature the horn . 
  so , i initially signed up for audible at audible.com/twit2 , since why would i go for any other code when that seems to be the only one that offers a free month with * two * books ? 
  stayed with audible for a while ( though switched down to a gold plan immediately after my free month ) and was enjoying it . 
  i recently started looking at a particular book , and noticed that the price for the kindle version + the discounted audible version was less than just waiting for the next credit to appear .
