  thanks for any help . 
  specifically , what would be the * difference * between the two above scenarios ( not so much how would things change compared to * today * ) ? 
  if stv were used to elect the electors under the current electoral college system on a state-by-state basis , what would that be like compared to either nationwide direct election through irv , or a state-by-state winner-takes-all election of the electoral college through irv ? 
  basically , i want to change my keyboard layout file ( ` / usr/share/x11 / xkb/symbols/us ` ) so that special keys like alt-n = \u00f1 work with both the left and right alt keys -- currently they only work with right alt . 
  i * think * that this can be achieved by adding in , to the bottom of the keyboard layout , ` include `` level3 ( lalt_switch ) '' ` . 
  my question is : are there any potential unforeseen consequences of doing this in linux ? 
  it 's the default behaviour on macos ( whose layouts i am attempting to emulate ) , but i 'm wondering if something in how linux handles keyboard shortcuts or similar might make this problematic . 
  ( secondary question : is adding that include line actually the correct way to go about achieving this ? 
  or can you only have one level3 definition ? ), 
  i 've found how to do it for a whole server , but is it possible to do it to suppress notifications only from a single * channel * that 's kind of abusing the use of these special mentions ? 
  i 've already got it set to not require a password when turning the computer on , but if the laptop 's lid is closed and then opened again , it * does * require a password . 
  that 's what i want to stop . 
  i found [ this guide ] ( http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7771/prevent-windows-asking-for-a-password-on-wake-up-from-sleepstandby/ ) and many others with similar instructions , but the `` require a password on wakeup '' button does n't exist any more . 
  or at least , it is n't displaying on the computer i 'm trying to do it with .

  merry christmas , all !, 
  i was away on holiday when it first came out , and figured when i got back just two weeks later it would still be showing , being such a huge , well received movie . 
  but i 've looked yesterday and today , and i ca n't find any cinemas still showing it . 
  cgv , lotte , and galaxy 's websites all seem to say it 's no longer showing . 
  anyone know anywhere it 's still on , or why they 've cut it from cinemas so soon , if not ?

  i 'm trying to set up a vpn on my parents ' media server ( running windows 10 ) , primarily to enable bypassing isp filtering from my isp ( in a different country to my parents ) . 
  i 've also got the goal of hopefully enabling some method of grabbing files off of the media server , but that may not need to go through the vpn if not feasible . 
  the computer i 'm currently using as a client is running macos , but ultimately i want to run clients on macos , linux ( kubuntu ) , and windows as well . 
  i would much rather be working with a linux server too , but that 's unfortunately not an option . 
  i installed the windows server and generated keys according to [ this guide ] ( https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/easy_windows_guide ) , and installed tunnelblick on my mac . 
  when i tried to add the config files generated on the server to the client it complained about lacking a ta.key file , so i generated that using the instructions in the config file ( ` openvpn -- genkey -- secret ta.key ` ) and added that file to both server and client . 
  i then tried connecting to the server from the client . 
  it said it was successfully connected , but tunnelblick gave a warning saying the public-facing ip address had not changed and sure enough when i tried googling `` my ip '' , it was showing the unchanged one . 
  some quick googling suggested enabling `` route all traffic through the vpn '' in tunnelblick , or adding ` push `` redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp '' ` to the server config . 
  i tried both of those separately and combined , and in each case , it resulted in absolutely no internet access on the client while connected to the server . 
  can anyone provide advice on how to move forward with this ? 
  get an internet connection through the vpn that uses the server 's network ? 
  thanks !,
