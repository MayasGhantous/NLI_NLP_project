  it 's important . 
  six represent the six states , and the last one represents the territories . 
  having an eight pointed star is like the yanks adding a row of stars to their flag . 
  it 's just not right . 
  now if someone who 's less shit at design than me could come up with a not-shit design for a seven pointed star in 5 or 6 pixels , that 'd be right on .

  running windows 10 with a ttesports keyboard , with vlc 2.2.4 . 
  in vlc 's preferences , i have play/pause 's global option set to my keyboard 's media button for play/pause . 
  the button works fine when vlc is in focus , but fails when it is not . 
  various results found on google suggested disabling certain settings within , or uninstalling entirely , `` microsoft mouse & keyboard center '' , but i have no such application installed . 
  one thing that * does * get it to work globally is running vlc in administrator mode . 
  but this is not an ideal solution , since it requires opening vlc up specifically and navigating through its menus to find a file to open , rather than just clicking on a video/audio file . 
  it also , for some reason , disables the ability to drag and drop files . 
  any help would be much appreciated . 
  thanks . 
  i 've been using praw for quite a while now on my laptop and desktop , but in trying to get it set up on my new raspberry pi , i 've been running into issues . 
  unlike on the other two devices , i 'm unable to do even the most basic of tasks on this new installation . 
  ` r = praw.reddit ( user_agent = `` bla bla bla '' ) ` gives me an error :, 
  clientexcption : required configuration setting ` client_id ' missing . 
  i have n't tried to actually access anything yet ( let alone * log in * , or * write anything * ) , simply do the most basic of tasks to be able to manually make sure i hav praw installed correctly . 
  only once i 've done that will i get to work on porting my bot across to the new server . 
  but i for some reason ca n't even get that working . 
  [ removed ], 
  i came across [ a 4 year old post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/zoqew/ok_swype_devs_this_is_getting_ridiculous_give_us/c66napb ) , that says you can get swiftkey to learn from your reddit comments by going to settings  personalisation , and clicking learn from my rss feed , and linking to an rss of your comments . 
  but there is no rss option under account  personalisation . 
  only facebook , gmail , g + , and twitter . 
  has this option been removed at some point ? 
  if so , how come ? 
  if not , where is it now ? 
  i tried editing ` / etc/hosts ` , but that seems to only work for bash itself . 
  when browsing from a windows web browser , the changes do n't seem to do anything . 
  i tried editing ` / mnt/c/windows / system32/drivers/etc / hosts ` , but ran in to permissions issues ( it 's 555 owned by root : root ) , and even ` sudo chmod u + w ` fails because `` permission denied '' . 
  is there a way to edit your hosts file from the wsl that works ? 
  title basically says it all . 
  would be nice to have a token that gets the flair of a submission . 
  one of my most commonly used macros is essentially `` i 've added `` this flair '' for you , but next time please do it yourself . '', 
  would be nice to not have to manually type out `` this flair '' every time , and instead have it auto-detect . 
  in the postgame , it lists your tactical skill and your strategic skill . 
  does anyone know what these actually are ? 
  the top google search results for the question seem to be rather inconclusive . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** raspberry pi suddenly using lxde desktop and has no internet connection or network settings . 
  want to be able to connect over wifi again . 
  also would like to know why lxde suddenly being used . 
  i do n't know why . 
  i rebooted it for the first time in ages today , and all of a sudden i have the lxde environment , with a taskbar at the bottom of the screen and a `` start '' menu that looks like the lxde logo , not the pi logo , instead of the menu at the top and the pi logo being the main menu . 
  many of my pi settings seem to have been reset to defaults as well , including keyboard layout , and it asks for password on log in ( or did until i checked the option to disable this ) , and it also asks for a password on waking from sleep . 
  the hostname and my account password have remained intact , however . 
  this would n't be a problem , except that i ca n't seem to find any way of connecting to the internet after this change happened . 
  nowhere in the `` preferences '' menu has anything to do with network connections , and the system tray had no network options until i went in and added some manually . 
  the `` manage networks '' panel option says `` eth0 connection has limited or no connectivity '' when hovered over , and clicking on it provides the options `` repair '' and `` disable '' , both of which appear to have no effect whatsoever . 
  i had updated the pi a few days earlier , so it should be running near the latest version of raspbian stretch . 
  it 's a raspberry pi 3 model b. 
  why has the bot not converted anything in over 8 days ?

  anyone know what the likelihood of a scheduled ride for after 3am being fulfilled is ? 
  the app itself says it `` does n't guarantee '' that the booking will be fulfilled , but it also does n't seem to give any feedback on whether or not someone has accepted it . 
  so i 'm wondering what other people 's experiences are . 
  used equivalently to `` fuck '' , in all senses . 
  it sounds to me like an early romantic type piece .
