   the goal of the * any business * is to get as much as you 're willing to pay as possible , on average . 
  ftfy , though it does n't * quite * work for advertiser-driven businesses . 
  what is this place and what happened to reddit ? 
  exactly . 
  that 's what 's so fucked up . 
  the * point * of offline mode is ( or should be ) so that you can continue to play single-player games that you bought on steam even if your internet connection dies . 
  you should n't have to log in and then start in offline mode . 
  thing is , sometimes it works as it should , and steam randomly will open up in offline mode when you ask it to . 
  other times it does n't . 
  i 've yet to figure out why . 
  youtube posted a while ago on a blog that they were going to implement measures so that rotating the image or placing it within a border ( \u00e0 la [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovedhffgdoo ) ) should n't work . 
  i 've not seen any evidence that it 's actually happened , though . 
  oh , but sometimes it * does * start up correctly even in offline mode the first time . 
  that 's why i said it randomly works sometimes , but not other times . 
  i 'm the same , * except * if i believe they 've been unjustly downvoted . 
  then i 'll upvote even if i disagree . 
  you 've just done precisely what the top comment of this thread said not to do : present a straw man . 
  and it 's a pretty obvious one at that . 
  the only bit of your comment even remotely valid is the first paragraph , so let me clear that up . 
  if you 're in a public location , you have no reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  if you 're in your home and have large windows pointing out to a public location , such that someone can easily see you , without any special effort , from a public location , you have no reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  if you 're in your home with closed curtains , or it is reasonably difficult to see into your house , then you have a reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  i realised it a while ago . 
  i usually search from the omnibar and go to the homepage when i see a doodle in the top left . 
  how about uninstalling adblock ? 
  it 's unlikely to be the problem , but it never hurts to try . 
  i got the impression he 's ( at least ) part asian , but she 's not . 
  hard to tell , though . 
  i 'm on mobile so the pic 's small , plus the colour of the picture . 
   boys came out of daddy and girls came out of mummy, 
  it does n't say that boys do n't * also * come out of their mum , or that girls do n't * also * come out of their dad . 
  haha i had pretty much the same thing . 
  graduated high school in may , but in november i went back to help out at a week-long inter-school music festival . 
  i was sitting at the piano messing around during a break , and a kid from one of the other schools ( probably in the lower years of high school ) said `` excuse me , sir , do you know where _____ ? '' . 
  that was super weird , but felt really cool at the same time . 
  horns should be tuned to different pitches , and you could play tunes on them !, 
  not quite . 
  a lot of people have only one or two children , and the amount of people having 4 or 5 children would be more than those having 6 . 
  this would still make for a lot more hermaphrodites than there actually are , though . 
  not so much cool as in `` i feel really proud to be considered an adult '' ( because oh god is that not true ... ) , but just cool as in it was really funny , and perhaps a cool story to be able to tell . 
  i had a cousin who told me how she thought you could fly if you swam breaststroke . 
  pretty sure tom cruise must think the same thing . 
  anyone know how well this works ? 
  what versions of windows will it work on ( is it valid as far back as xp , and will it work in win8 ? 
  ) , and how easy is it to use ? 
  can you just plug it in , run a script , and it will work until unplugged , or might you need permissions in some cases , or something more complicated ? 
  got any more ? 
  more pictures , video , or a text description of what happened ? 
  and sonatas seem to be pretty evenly split between 3 and 4 moovement pieces . 
  edit :, 
  really big exception in symphonic structure : sibelius 7, 
   the 1st movement always has the sonata form ( also in symphonies ) , it presents one or more themes . 
  [ almost always ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arnrfubbnyc ) . 
  as with any `` rule '' in music , there are exceptions . 
  did multi-movement works evolve from musical suites , such as dance suites ? 
  i vaguely remember being taught that at some point . 
  it feels like it could be the music to a game or show from japan , but honestly that 's little more than a guess . 
  students of what ages ? 
  for students in primary school , i 'm doubtful , but it 's a brilliant idea for high school . 
  a dutch person that does n't speak english !? 
  i did n't think such a thing existed !, 
  and scientific is 431 hz !, 
  ( c is always a power of two , so c4 -- middle c -- is 256 ) . 
  side note , i 've always heard that modern orchestras tune to 440 hz . 
  have you a source that says otherwise ? 
  but what instrument would be in bb but not take a key signature ( while not itself being an instrument in the key of bb ) !, 
  it 's clearly 3/4 with an odd notation . 
  must be modern music . 
  works better , in fact . 
  i 've heard it as 22 was 12 , and 22112 , but it works exactly the same either way . 
  [ you 're in the wrong subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vietnam ) . 
  haha i did look it up , and found 440 hz . 
  that 's why i asked , because your precious comment seemed to imply otherwise . 
   and i 'm not paying $ 400 for one on ebay, 
  fuck , that 's what i got ta pay on play ... bloody australian rip-off tech prices . 
  and a fair bit of french also , from the likes of satie and ravel , for example . 
  it 's similar to many sports . 
  in cycling and fencing the official language is french , with words like peloton ( cycling ) and touch\u00e9 ( fencing ) . 
  ( this comment is meant to be taken in addition to the ones already been made . ), 
  fixed ? 
  since when ? 
  just yesterday i could n't open steam because i was n't connected to the internet . 
  it 's absolute bullshit . 
  steam wo n't ( always -- for some reason it seems intermittent ) let you open it up of you do n't have a connection , either . 
  yeah , it 's intermittent . 
  sometimes it works , often it does n't . 
  ca n't pirate a game that needs to be in constant communication with their servers , unfortunately . 
  name 's horn . 
  french horn . 
  honestly , having just moved back here after 8 years overseas , the last 5 of which were in vietnam , i feel a lot safer crossing roads there than i do here ( at least when it 's not at a traffic light ) . 
  unless you meant the quality of the infrastructure itself . 
  because hell no ( at least comparing brisbane to hcmc , i dunno about western or northern qld ) . 
  andy ihnatko 's really let himself go . 
  image from [ here ] ( http://www.randomconnections.com/all-hail-the-cimbasso/ ) , but found the name of the instrument from [ here ] ( http://boards.fool.co.uk/what-was-it-12636472.aspx?sort=whole ) . 
  ctrl + t seems to be a `` no fog of war '' type cheat ( if you 're familiar with rts games ) . 
  it lets you see all parties and tracks on the entire map . 
  i did n't even know m&b ** had ** cheats until seeing this post , but [ here 's a full list of them ] ( http://mountandblade.wikia.com/wiki/cheats ) .
