  fuck that 's clever . 
  maybe a variation of it to end up with a longer password , but even those that you 've got , according to [ this site ] ( http://www.passwordmeter.com/ ) are :, 
  something as simple as putting the number value of the very first letter in between the letter and its capital iteration jumps you up to 100 % , and will add 1 or 2 characters to the length . 
  by the way everyone , now that you 've seen this rule , do not use it . 
  make up your own similar one , but do n't use this exact one , just on the off chance some hacker 's come across it . 
  it 's true that this kind of behaviour is n't even * close * to being `` ocd '' per se , but obsessive compulsiveness is a spectrum , and if this kind of thing bothers you a lot , you are likely higher ( slightly ) on that spectrum than average . 
  this is especially true if you 're likely to have an involuntary , physical ( even a small one ) , reaction to such things . 
  but no , it does n't mean `` you are ocd '' . 
  i sometimes switch to first person when lancing , but 3rd for everything else . 
  i would 've been at least 100 hours in before i found it out by myself , and i 've never even touched multiplayer . 
  yeah , i said sometimes , because i 'll often switch to first right to the last moment because i find it helps me line up the lance better . 
  all true . 
  however , the point at which the legal diagnosis is made in each case is somewhat arbitrary . 
  alzheimer 's is a degenerative disease , which by definition hits you slowly . 
  by definition , short-sightedness and legal blindness must be extensions of the same basic problem : an inability to see properly . 
  however , the one that best matches ocd is probably asd . 
  autism spectrum disorders are measured on a specific spectrum on which any individual can be placed . 
  you can even take an aq ( autism quotient ) test to give you a rough placement on that spectrum . 
  ocd lacks , to my knowledge , that specific measured spectrum , but it is still a spectrum . 
  at a certain point it becomes diagnosable , and most people who blame things on `` their ocd '' are nowhere near this point ( and in fact the people who say that kind of thing , stereotypically , may not even be worse than average ) . 
  i would strongly recommend you watch a bunch of the other orchestration online videos , and even subscribe . 
  there 'll be a bunch of videos that may not matter to you , but could be interesting anyway . 
  some may neither matter nor be interesting to you ( the ones about sibelius 7 , for example ) , but a lot of the ones actually about orchestration are incredibly high quality , and at the moment he 's doing a video a week on different instruments/sections . 
  make sure to read the text tips at the end of the videos !, 
  but good job on talking to performers , that 's something most composers would highly recommend . 
  most of them are mainly about knowing what pieces of music are shown . 
  the facebook page is helpful for that . 
  he posts each comic there , and people usually comment what piece it is . 
  like kingbirdy said , it 's not centralised . 
  it 's structured more like a whole bunch of blogs ( particularly wordpress . 
  ** com ** blogs ) , though with a higher emphasis on socialness and less on the actual content . 
  i used to use it regularly , but ca n't be arsed most of the time anymore . 
  i 've only found out about this campaign now , but if there 's another one i 'll try to partake . 
  which is great ! . . if you 're in america . 
  google voice does n't exist ( in any remotely useful way ) anywhere else . 
  there 's a movie made about cluedo ? 
  yeah , the actual wording of godwin 's law is, 
   as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches 1 . 
  that 's the law , and the tradition of that being a '' / thread '' moment , and the debate being lost by whoever invoked the law , is only tradition . 
  i 'd still say we can call this a real-life godwin 's law , though , even if it technically is n't correct . 
  i thought it was a terrible film . 
  it was just full of logical inconsistencies . 
  why the fuck does he go around saying `` take their wallets but do n't take anything fucking useful '' it 's full of examples where he 's a terrible leader like that . 
  he 's brilliant , but that movie was terrible . 
  his character in it is just completely fucking stupid and useless . 
  he tells them to collect wallets for their id , but not to take anything else . 
  that 's the complete opposite of what you should do in such a survival situation . 
  they would 've had useful stuff , but neeson 's character was too stupid to think it might make sense to use it . 
  yes , battle royale is great , but comparing it to the hunger games does an injustice to both stories . 
  sure , they have the same basic premise , but the two of them are completely unrelated otherwise . 
  in br , the program is a punishment for children , and within the larger story it 's about punishing bad children . 
  in it , the children start out as ordinary children , and friends , but end up having to kill each other . 
  it 's vaguely similar to lord of the flies in this regard . 
  hg is much more political . 
  the games exist as a punishment for the entirety of panem . 
  in it , the fact that the entire country is forced to watch is perhaps the most important aspect . 
  it 's about the capital showing how much power it has over the districts . 
  it went in a sort of political allegory kind of direction , showing how the leaders of district 13 et al were heading in a direction to be extremely similar to the capital . 
  vaguely similar to animal farm .

  did n't crash skype or microsoft word ... 
  i do n't want to try it in chrome or textedit for fear of losing data ( probably would n't happen , but not taking the risk ) . 
  edit : tried sibelius 7 , no crashes in that . 
  tried safari , it crashed . 
  alfred crashed , and so did spotlight when i tried that . 
  editedit : it crashes skype when typed into the search bar , but not the actual im bar ... 
  someone has uploaded the entire contents of your hard drive to the internet , and you just found the link to it . 
  source : my arse, 
  thing is , a mac will perform better than another computer with the same specs , so if you 're after performance a direct spec comparison is n't fair . 
  source : i could n't imagine living without one of each ( windows custom-built desktop , macbook pro ), 
  actually , it 's been true in my experience . 
  the it department at my high school was constantly having trouble getting the macs ( for the music and design tech departments ) to connect properly to the network . 
  i do n't know for certain if it 's a problem with the macs , or just that our it department was incompetent . 
  the latter of those is certainly * true * , but i do n't know if that was the problem . 
  it could be just that many it departments are n't used to macs , and do n't know how to connect them properly , but i do suspect the os probably plays some role . 
  ah , that explains it . 
  but huh ... i always figured skype did use system-wide spellcheck . 
  guess not . 
  slightly off topic , could you explain from a photographer 's perspective `` soft focus '' actually is ? 
  does it just mean focussing slightly behind/in front of the subject ? 
  : / \u02c8\u0283o\u028ap\u00e6n / ; french pronunciation : [ \u0283\u0254.p\u025b\u0303 ], 
  the first one reads : sh oe ( as in `` code '' ) p a ( as in ban ) n. so , show-pan , more or less . 
  emphasis goes on the first syllable . 
  the second one reads sh aw ( like `` law '' ) p in ( the french nasal sound , like in `` vin '' or `` bi ** en ** '' ) . 
  so , shawpin , remembering particularly that the `` in '' is that french nasal sound , and not the opposite of `` out '' in english . 
  the joke here comes not from how his name is actually pronounced ( because anyone pronouncing it like chopping is completely and utterly wrong ) , but from how it 's written . 
  the angle helps them get past youtube 's detection system . 
  although there was a blog post a while back about how youtube was implementing systems to be able to detect picture-in-picture , rotated , and flipped images . 
  apparently that was a lie . 
  the two dots ( umlaut ) over the ` u ', 
  the umlaut is two dots , so if there were two umlauts , there would be four dots . 
  i wonder how you 'd pronounce that ... 
   do you have any additional thoughts ? 
  did anyone else say something along the lines of `` you better share the results of this '' ? 
  coos damn i really wan na see them !, 
  yeah , we 're not yanks !, 
  yes , that 's what signing on means . 
  courses are , for example , math1052 .
