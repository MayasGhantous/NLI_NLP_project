  you 'll have to sign on to at least one course before you can get your student card ( and yeah , they 're strict on that , i tried ) . 
  you need to sign on specifically to individual timeslots for tutes , lectures , etc. 
  i 'm sure a lot of you already know this , but pluto was actually discovered during holst 's lifetime . 
  he refused to write an additional movement to his the planets suite because he did n't like how popular it was compared to his other music . 
  holst thought it got more attention than it deserved , and that his other music was worthy of more attention . 
  edit : and , of course , in 2006 , holst managed to get back at all those who gave the planets more attention than it deserved , by being proven right in not writing a movement for pluto !, 
  i love that col legno at the beginning !, 
  sounds so menacing . 
  [ here 's a link to the relevant blog post ] ( http://youtubecreator.blogspot.de/2012/04/improving-rights-management-at-youtube.html ) . 
  but yeah , when i said lie , i was n't using the right word , i was just too lazy to think what the right word is . 
  what i really meant was simply that it had n't happened how they said it would . 
  ** artist -  venue -  listener ** , unless the venue can be obtained for free . 
  if you 've enrolled in * courses * then you will be able to get your student card . 
  they say you need to wait up to 24 hours after enrolling in a course , but i think that 's more a precaution than anything else . 
  yeah , you ca n't sign on until later , that 's normal . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  my first android phone ( and first smartphone ) is scheduled to arrive this wednesday . 
  i 've signed up to request an invite , and look forward to playing when/if i get in . 
  side note , everything i 've heard about it so far has been from the aaa podcast , and as i understand it , there 're two teams . 
  on the map , it seems completely blue except for that one green spot . 
  are green and blue the colours of the two teams ? 
  time for / r/truevertical ? 
  thanks !, 
  my first thought when seeing this was , how slow must the shutter speed have been to get that many stars ? 
  in case anyone else was the same : 20 sec, 
  also , f/1 .6 , iso 2000 , at 50mm, 
  i 'm confused . 
  500px says `` nilgiri south ( 6,839 m ) '' as the title for the picture , but the description says `` nepal , view of the kali gandaki river and nilgiri south ( 6,839 m ) , 2011 '' . 
  true , and honestly i would n't normally bother , but the guy asked about it , so i provided . 
  however , chopin does have accepted pronunciation in english . 
  his name 's been around long enough that it 's fairly defined , and that pronunciation is n't chopping . 
  agreed , especially with this one as small as it is . 
  oh , i 've just been going through the score of the planets , for / r/classyclub , and it has `` naturale '' written . 
  that 's probably where you got it from when you used it to end `` pizz . '' . 
  in this , it 's used to end * col legno * , which means hitting the strings with the wood of the bow . 
  how exactly does it work ? 
  can it be done in-camera , and if so , how ? 
  edit : and , come to think of it , why , exactly ? 
  what reasons would someone usually have to use it ? 
  ah , right . 
  many people criticise thg for being no more than a cheap rip-off of br , and that 's what i thought you were doing . 
  sorry for the mistake . 
  haha yeah , i 'm an amateur photographer too , and was just curious how this is done . 
  thanks !, 
  you can leave it blank . 
  that 's what i did . 
  i really like how you made this possible for someone who does n't follow american football in the * slightest * to complete . 
  great job . 
  no worries , someone coming across this by chance may be interested but not already know . 
  there are !, 
  unfortunately , nothing about specific bits that were cut out , but there 's an entire omnibus series on different topics . 
  it 's brilliant !, 
  that sounds incredibly counter-intuitive to me . 
  the xbox layout is the one that 's unsymmetrical and makes you put your hands at a `` weird-ass angle '' , at least in my opinion . 
  to each his own , i guess . 
  horses were n't broken . 
  gas lamps were n't broken . 
  giant computers that took up multiple rooms were n't broken . 
  i agree completely with you . 
  `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' is a really shitty attitude to have in the vast majority of cases . 
  just wan na say , if you think they 're annoying on laptops , you 've obviously not used a macbook . 
  but i think in terms of games , there is a place for them , if they 're used well . 
  it would n't be pressing things , or to be used like a mouse , but only simple quick , broad , gestures , like swipes up and down , or a tap on the left or right * half * ( i.e. , the entire half of the touchpad would count , it ca n't be more specific ) of it . 
  i agree with your conclusion , but not the premise . 
  yes sony made a mistake with its security ( but it was ** nowhere near ** as bad as storing credit card info in plain text files ) , but for exactly that reason , i 'd say i probably would feel more comfortable trusting my info to them today than microsoft . 
  they 've suffered from the hack , so they 're obviously going to double down on security . 
  microsoft has n't suffered , and while they * may * have increased their own security in response to the attack upon sony , they still have n't been hacked themselves . 
   have fun not playing xbox exclusives, 
  awesome . 
  i 'll confess , i 'm actually a pc gamer , but i have exactly zero interest in any of the xbox exclusives . 
  there are some amazing exclusives for ps3 that i 'm really interested in , but just not quite enough to justify getting one for me . 
  others may prefer xbox exclusives , and they 're entitled to , but there are plenty of people think the same as me . 
  but i agree with you about saying ms `` really fucked up '' is ridiculous . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  i find the triggers on the xbox make it much harder to switch between the r1 and r2 buttons , and the triggers themselves are more awkward to press . 
  no , please do n't !, 
  they make it harder to switch back and forth between the r1 and r2 buttons , and to me the buttons themselves do n't feel as comfortable . 
  the computers , definitely . 
  the lamps , arguable , but horses ? 
  i hardly think they were terribly inefficient . 
  sure , they are compared to cars , but when nobody had thought of cars it would n't make sense to say that . 
  who knows , some new design of a controller could turn out to be the car . 
  it 's worth it to try . 
  oh , he just said that english often takes foreign words and will often change the pronunciations of them , so that in english the correct pronunciation can be different to the original correct pronunciation . 
  but yeah , you 're absolutely right on every point there . 
  i thought '' * some people , especially if they emigrated regularly to different language-speaking countries , would have multiple accepted pronunciations of their name * '' was particularly well written . 
  ah yes , very good point . 
  honestly , i play games on it all the time when i 'm away from my desktop gaming pc . 
  in particular , i played assassin 's creed ( i forget which one , the one that starts with the siege on his home , i * think * brotherhood ) , portal , and portal 2 . 
  for the latter two , i changed from left and right click to q and e , and it worked just fine . 
  at the moment i 'm alternating between playing minecraft and civ v , and both of those are also fine on it . 
  yes , the touchpad is no where near as good as even a shitty mouse , but it works brilliantly for non-gaming stuff , and it 's much better than you 'd expect for games . 
  it 's a great idea . 
  personally , i have a mbp and a custom-built desktop running windows . 
  i love them both , and at this point i ca n't ever imagine getting a laptop that * is n't * a mac , but also i do n't think i could justify getting an apple desktop . 
  the touchpad is absolutely brilliant , and for day-to-day stuff , probably even * better * than most mouses . 
  you swipe with two fingers up and down to scroll , and it 's a buttery smooth scroll , not staggered like with a mouse . 
  three fingers left or right will move between spaces or different fullscreen applications ( i always like to keep my browser fullscreen , it 's a great experience ) . 
  two fingers left and right goes forward and backward in the browser , you can pinch to zoom ( though unfortunately chrome does n't handle this all that well compared to apple 's own safari ) . 
  the media control buttons actually work as you would expect them to ( i ca n't say i 've had the same experience on most hp/dell/whatever keyboards with media control buttons ) .
