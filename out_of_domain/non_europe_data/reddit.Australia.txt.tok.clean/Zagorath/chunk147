  yup , qld . 
  i take it tassy does n't use daylight saving , then ? 
  oh right . 
  would n't that make you utc +11 at the moment , then ? 
  or has daylight saving ended already ? 
  it 's all such nonsense , i do n't really both following it that much . 
  yeah , because utc/gmt is constant , but if you move your clocks forward an hour , your time zone with relation to that constant will be different . 
  and how much data could you expect to use each day/week/month ? 
  it 's very common in asia ( particularly north-east ) to place the family name before the personal name . 
  edit : by the way , i ca n't say i 've * ever * seen a site that requires a middle name . 
  i think it 's probably more common to see sites that do n't even offer the option of a middle name . 
  i was asked once , said no . 
  i actually later changed my mind and decided to go real name , and had great difficulty getting it to let me . 
  eventually figured it out , though . 
  if you 've got a good connection , vimeo is amazing ( and far better than youtube if you want to watch the video from start to finish ) . 
  the problem is , on weaker connections it absolutely shits out . 
  it also lacks the amazing social features of youtube . 
  why not give g + a chance ? 
  it 's actually really good . 
  join a few communities about whatever you 're interested in and engage in them . 
  if you could get real life friends on it , it would also take the place of facebook , except that it 's * so * much better at just about everything . 
  which i think is a brilliant idea . 
  if you 're going to be reviewing the app in a way that the developer him/herself can be directly influenced by it , i think it makes sense to put a face to it . 
  that way people ca n't leave scathing comments anonymously for the heck of it . 
  what did he say ? 
  everyone likes their own brand, 
  i find it really interesting that they write `` america '' in a direct phonetic way ( \uc544\uba54\ub9ac\uce74 ) rather than the native korean word that they use in the south , \ubbf8\uad6d . 
  because it worked for gmail , and they somehow have decided to ignore how it did n't work for wave or g + . 
  wow thanks !, 
  i 've installed it myself . 
  `` windows phone '' simply should n't be an option . 
  the rest of them are all hardware manufacturers ( given / u/amyosaurus 's explanation of t-mobile ) . 
  he 's missed one fairly major player ( blackberry ) , and at least one that was formerly large enough that it could potentially still be an answer for some people ( palm ) . 
  remember tales of ba sing se ? 
  the song `` leaves from the vine '' ? 
  that was dedicated to him , as it was his last episode before his death . 
  makes that song all the more poignant . 
  damn , now i got ta watch it , too . 
  i ca n't have seen more than a handful of episodes when it was on tv . 
  i really hope it 's first revealed in the show . 
  it would seem anti-climactic for it to be revealed in the comic , which i view as kinda an addendum to the canonical tv shows ( although i know the comic is also canon ) . 
  ooo , part 3 is already out ? 
  i got ta go get it !, 
  only read parts 1 and 2 . 
  from what i could gather from basco 's comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/17ybeo/i_am_rufio_prince_zuko_ama/c8a0rqu?context=2 ) , they had recorded a third season which ends a little differently ...

  oh , well then now i 'm confused again ... thanks for the info, 
  socialised health care and full out socialism are two very different things . 
  holy shit . 
  was this before or after port arthur ? 
  just a tip , outside of america ( and possibly canada ) coins are n't called `` pennies '' and `` nickels '' . 
  it 's just a 5c coin . 
  the option would be to pay a living wage . 
  there 's no * requirement * for these places to pay minimum wage . 
  you could put out signs explicitly stating that tips are not expected , that would probably bring more business even if the stated prices are a bit higher . 
  you obviously meant `` not '' even close to the same . 
  but what did you mean by `` tips in most countries mean rounding up the bill '' ? 
  is that saying that your tip is only 1 or 2 cents , or is it a case of `` the bill was $ 45 , i 'll just leave a $ 50 '' ? 
  the latter is fairly accurate , but if you meant the former you 're just being bizarre . 
  not to mention minimum wage is usually a hell of a lot higher than it is in the us . 
  us minimum wages range from $ 7.25 ( federal ) to $ 9.19 ( in washington ) . 
  australia 's minimum wage for people over 21 is $ 15.96 , decreasing each year younger to $ 7.55 at 16 ( with separate wages for apprentices based on which year of apprenticeship they 're in ) . 
  in the uk , those 21 + get # 6.19 . 
  18 -- 20 year-olds get # 4.98 and under 18 you get # 3.68 . 
  that 's roughly $ 9.70 , $ 7.80 , and $ 5.77 in us dollars . 
  exactly , it costs the same as a mba . 
  the argument here is n't anything to do with apple devices being expensive ( crracktheskye made reference to that argument , but that is n't the main point in this ) , it 's that two devices is going to cost more than one device . 
  a mba and ipad will cost more than a single surface pro . 
  positioning the surface pro as an alternative to owning both a mba and ipad makes sense in this way : you save money , and have to carry around less stuff . 
  speaking from someone who arrived only once the ama had finished , and only seeing the higher voted posts , this ama seemed to go really well for the surface team . 
  there was some criticism , but it was handled really well . 
  for the most part , the questions were a lot less accusatory than i was expecting , too . 
  ouch . 
  i assume you mean [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1526uu/we_work_at_youtube_and_were_involved_in_the/ ) , which i must 've missed somehow . 
  yeah , i understand a lot of criticism , but threads like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1526uu/we_work_at_youtube_and_were_involved_in_the/c7ip877?context=3 ) ( and many others ) seem like reddit was bashing them for the sake of bashing them . 
  but your neighbours * would n't * pick your ruler under this idea . 
  they would * influence * ** your ** decision in who ** you ** pick as a ruler . 
  and i think that 's a great idea . 
  yeah , i know that . 
  however colloquially i see americans refer to the penny , dime , nickel , whatever , all the time, 
  in britain they use penny because that 's the official denomination , but as far as i know they do n't use the other words since switching to decimal currency ( i could be wrong , however ) . 
  i know australia does n't use any of those terms , however , and i 've never heard of them used in relation to any country other than america and canada 's decimal currency . 
  this is brilliant !, 
  it sounds exactly like a proper jazz piece !, 
  by the way , i present to you , the interrobang !, 
  it was a tax . 
  it was the australia tax . 
  so what are you gon na do ? 
  use mac os x ? 
  admittedly , the `` australia tax '' on apple products is lower than on other products , but that 's because the margins are so high already they do n't need to increase the prices as much . 
  and even then , you do pay more for a mac in australia than in windows . 
  linux simply is n't as useable for the average person as windows and mac os are . 
  if you 're a techy it 's nice , but it simply is n't ready ( and * probably * never will be ) for mass market . 
  fine then . 
  windows 8 launches faster , and has more built in security . 
  try and twist that into a negative . 
  if you downvoted him , you may want to look into [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  i also disagree with his post , but it was constructive and added to the conversation , so i shall not downvote either you or deadboots . 
  i use google drive for a lot of my stuff , but do n't pretend that open office or libre office are really competitive with microsoft office . 
  their spreadsheet software is absolutely useless , and the word processing software lacks the only feature that really matters to me , and a feature which is incredibly useful to anyone who knows about it and uses it : the slick automatic referencing .
