  even as valve ports games over to steam , not all games will move over . 
  steam has been on mac for a while now , and while the gaming situation on os x has improved dramatically in that time , it 's still no where near equal to windows . 
  i do n't think linux will even get to a point as good as os x , and it certainly wo n't pass it any time soon . 
  the main reason linux is n't a feasible alternative to windows for most people , however , is that it just is n't as useable . 
  i have n't actually tried ubuntu , but i did put mint on a spare computer a few months ago , and even as a techy it felt like a pain a lot of the time . 
  i ca n't imagine what it would be like to use linux with the same level as technical expertise as my parents , and even many of my peers , have . 
  by the way , an honest question , do you have good alternatives to final cut pro , motion , and aperture ( video editing , special effects , and image managing/non-destructive editing , respectively ) that run on linux ? 
  that was uncharacteristically positive of him . 
  it 's true that i would n't expect old games to be ported , but i like to look at gaming on linux in a similar way to gaming on mac . 
  steam had a huge positive impact , but there are still many new games not available on os x. ubisoft has even gone * backwards * . 
  ac ii and brotherhood were available on os x , but revelations and iii are not , for example . 
  i see no reason to expect that linux will get into a better position , especially considering it has a weaker starting position , and the userbase is both significantly smaller and has a reputation ( whether deserved or not ) for being less likely to buy things . 
  how can you tell it 's `` engineering paper '' ? 
  heck , what does engineering paper even mean ? 
  how is it different from normal gridded maths paper ? 
  it 's usually recommended that you do you ee in a subject that you take . 
  failing that , you should at least do one that your school offers so they have an experienced teacher who can supervise you . 
  however , you are allowed to do an ee in any subject at all . 
  but what does `` engineering paper '' even mean ? 
  is it just a substitute for gridded paper , or is there something special about this type ? 
  [ sibelius , kullervo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zpxpq-lhsm ), 
  [ rimsky-korsakov , scheherazade ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqnymnatr-y ), 
  i 'd like to reiterate beethoven 's 6th and stravinsky 's rite of spring , mentioned by snow-clone . 
  edit : how could i forget , [ berlioz , symphonie fantastique ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dwji1ulszw ) !, 
  the last two movements , and * especially * the last movement , are just amazing . 
  on a similar line , the first movement to beethoven piano sonata no. 14 ( yes , `` moonlight '' ) . 
  its name is somewhat misleading , as beethoven actually copied out a funeral march from mozart in his notes for this movement , it 's likely that he intended it to be similar to a funeral march itself . 
  also , [ chopin prelude no. 4 in e minor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiwpzhj-pic ) . 
  ebony was the black keys ( a type of wood ) . 
  the white keys used to be ivory . 
  i suspect ( though this is pure speculation ) that ivory has always been more expensive than ebony , and thus the smaller , less numerous , sharp and flat keys were made of ivory , while the natural keys were made of ebony . 
  i 'd say that at some point they changed what they made the keys out of , and at that time it became less expensive to manufacture white keys . 
  wikipedia says the black keys are still made of ebony , and seems to imply that it might wear out , and that this is a reason they use ebony on the sharp keys , rather than the natural keys . 
  it does n't explicitly * state * that , however , so i could be misunderstanding it . 
  the best [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/musical_keyboard ) article i could find was not all that helpful , however , when it comes to knowing why the keys are how they are . 
  i can dodge traffic !, 
  you tried clearing cache and history and stuff ? 
  and what exactly makes you think it 's my-si net ? 
  could there be anything else in common ? 
  you forgot the link . 
  to be fair , the eu is also the place that is banning computers that do n't have shrouds over their * internal * fans , to `` protect '' people who * are already smart enough to be opening their computers and fiddling with things * . 
  edit : i 'm getting a lot of people calling bullshit on this . 
  [ it 's true ] ( http://www.tomshardware.com/news/mac-pro-europe-discontinued-new-regulations-pulled,20840.html ) , [ and has resulted in apple discontinuing their mac pros in europe ] ( http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/379645/apple-mac-pro-too-dangerous-for-europe ) , [ effective march 1 ] ( http://apple.slashdot.org/story/13/02/02/1340211/apple-to-discontinue-mac-pro-in-eu-over-safety-regulations ) . 
  i do n't know if all the downvoting is the anti-apple parade , people who just have n't heard this story , or eu fanboys ( does such a thing exist ? 
  ) , or what , but it 's true . 
  honestly , i 'm amazed at how much positive attention the eu seems to get . 
  everything i 've heard about it , relating to multiple different cases of technology laws ( the microsoft/ie thing , the fan issue i 've just mentioned , overzealous privacy stuff , etc. 
  ) , and also relating to their protectionist and borderline anti-competitive ( in a practical sense , obviously not in a * legal * sense ) economic policies , makes me absolutely despise the eu . 
  there , i 've done it . 
  [ no it 's not ] ( http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/379645/apple-mac-pro-too-dangerous-for-europe ), 
  i 've edited with the main reason i chose to mention this , but specifically :, 
  the eu has introduced legislation that requires fans inside of desktop computers to have shrouds over them , supposedly for safety . 
  what made my previous comment confusing was that i was trying to simultaneously word my disgust in this move , because i believe that the only people who would open up a computer already know what the fuck they 're doing , and are likely not going to hurt themselves . 
  the fact that the mac pro is being stopped could be a number of reasons . 
  it 's highly unlikely that it 's just because it 's too expensive for them to swap the fans out . 
  however , it could be apple trying to say fuck you to the eu for introducing this bullshit law in the first place , and as much as i disagree with apple 's legal practices , i would have to applaud them if that is the reason . 
  most likely it 's just because it 's not worth making that one small change when they 're going to be releasing a brand new one later this year . 
  i 've edited the previous post with sources , and some more clarification on my opinions of the eu . 
  no , but how many people do you know who have opened up a computer without at least the basic knowledge of how not to hurt themselves on a fan that might be inside it ? 
  not very many , i suspect . 
  then there 's [ this source ] ( http://www.tomshardware.com/news/mac-pro-europe-discontinued-new-regulations-pulled,20840.html ) , and [ this one ] ( http://apple.slashdot.org/story/13/02/02/1340211/apple-to-discontinue-mac-pro-in-eu-over-safety-regulations ) . 
  honestly all three of these sources were just the first ones that came up when i did a search . 
  i first heard about it on the twit podcast . 
  solution : the people who want to stop street art should get it all framed . 
  just shift . 
  works in a huge variety of other programs , too . 
  probably because , compared to the other objects in the photo , it 's incredibly sharp . 
  the others are much softer . 
  not to mention the different lighting on it . 
  in a kind of strange , round about way , they do have * something * to do with time . 
  remember , parsec comes from `` parallax second '' , and it 's defined as the distance at which the parallax angle is one arcsecond . 
  what that means is if you draw an angle from earth at its periapsis ( closest point to the sun ) , to the object , back to earth at its apoapsis ( furthest point from the sun ) , it would attend an angle of one arcsecond , or 1/3600 \u02da . 
  of course , here `` second '' is n't referring to the time value , but the conflation of the word 's usual meaning with its meaning in relation to angles means you could say parsecs do have something to do with time . 
  i would prefer it if we never let m night shabamallama something to say about anything . 
  and at least one reference to arya from game of thrones . 
  m\u1ebf n\u1ebf\u00ed th\u1eb9r . 
  i have n't watched anything on cartoon network in years ( i download yj ) , but i flicked over to it a while back and saw live action and was like what the fuck ? 
  it 's called ** cartoon ** network , why the fuck are there physical people on there , recorded by a camera ? 
  or even worse , a person who would self-identify as korean , having grown up in korea , supporting korean sports teams , etc. , but japanese heritage . 
  what do you mean by `` break away '' ? 
  f\u00fcr elise is in a rondo form , you could analyse it as being abaca , or in more detail , aabbcdabefab, 
  [ here 's a full version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvw8tggy_w ) . 
  just taking that first analysis , a first appears at the beginning , b first appears at 0:57 , returning to a at 1:19 . 
  c is from 1:46 , then back to a to end from 2:18 . 
  which part had you not heard before ? 
  a tip i would give , use photos that do try to convey the mood of the music , or even better , have the video follow along the score !, 
  i agree that if he had already agreed in an official way , he should have honoured that commitment . 
  however , you previously stated `` sleazed out really early in his career '' . 
  wggn pointed out that it was n't `` early in his career '' at all . 
  i 'd also say he deserves some leeway for unexpected circumstances . 
  question 3 : what if you use more than one ? 
  the wording is such that you should be able to choose more than one , but the actual survey wo n't let you . 
  question 4 : what if you use a different web browser , or different im client , aside from safari and imessage ? 
  are they valid ? 
  as far as i know , on youtube you retain all rights to the work . 
  ( however , even if i 'm wrong on that , the audio that you 've already put up there is worth far more to youtube than the score would be . ), 
  [ i do it just by taking a screenshot of the score and editing it together ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl5d62f69e03f14d45 ) manually . 
  if your score is in software that can playback the audio ( sibelius , for example ) , you could get some free screen recording software and record that video , and edit it together with the exported audio . 
  by the way , if you 're going to be worried about copyright , you should also make sure to respect the copyright of others . 
  i do n't know where you got the images in your video currently , but you should make sure to use royalty-free stuff , ideally public domain or creative commons ( the latter of which would require , at the very least , attribution ) .
