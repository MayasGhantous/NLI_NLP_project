  you do n't have to kill him , though !, 
  the only advantage to it is that you join the blades , whose purpose is to slay more dragons . 
  not a logical path for one that likes dragons :(,

  if you 're on a mac , pressing control + option + command +8 will invert the colours of the screen , and you can easily press it again to switch back when you 're on an already dark website . 
  good point , actually . 
  personally , i did n't kill him for a completely different reason : i felt he was better than most dragons , an did n't deserve the same fate as them . 
  age of mythology was a spin-off that happened in between 2 and 3 ( i think ) . 
  what i think you 're thinking of is age of empires online . 
  so close !, 
  wuv woo , with the space . 
  i always feel exactly the same way when taking any test that asks me to rate myself in different areas . 
  just out of curiosity , do you know of any good such tests , other than the jung one linked in the sidebar ? 
  my favourite aoe cheats : pepperoni pizza , coinage , big daddy, 
  they 're all from the original aoe . 
  in order , 1000 food , 1000 gold , uber-destructive really fast car . 
  ( not sure about the number , but i think it 's 1000 for those resource cheats . ), 
  no , it 's [ this image ] ( http://aoe.heavengames.com/academy/hotkeysandcommands/pix/unit_bigdaddy.jpg ) . 
  you may be confusing it with the aoe2 car , whose cheat code i do n't remember , but it looks like [ this ] ( http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/4/46532/1203391-age_of_empires_cobra_car_super.jpg ) . 
  odd , i just took them from a google image search ... 
  anyway , [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/xemtw ) and [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/0i7zb ) they are , in the same order as previous , on imgur . 
  how do you get .68 of a condition ? 
  really ? 
  because most times my computer 's frozen and i want to use task manager it does n't work . 
  it 's fine if a single smallish programme 's hanging , but not , say , a game . 
   that 's like saying a guy is `` husband material '' for . 
  hung his ex-girlfriend a bottle of shampoo she likes . 
  there you go !, 
  now you 're getting with us !, 
  i forgot all about e = mc2 !, 
  that 's one of my favourite cheats !!, 
  the guy who deleted his comment had said something that amounted to `` is that the shitty cartoony game ? '', 
  as for my first sentence , i think it 's still correct , aom is a spin-off of the series , and time-wise it was released between 2 and 3 . 
  esbern was massively bugged for me . 
  he just did n't talk . 
  actually , that 's what i was talking about , sorry i did n't make it clear . 
  i did n't even know ctrl-shift-esc until now . 
  i stopped replying because , quite frankly , i got bored of the discussion . 
  it did n't really seem to be going anywhere . 
  when i came across this article ( on / r/atheism , so you may already have seen it ) , it reminded me of our little debate , so i thought i 'd share it as an example of someone who is not moderate , but who goes about it in a respectful and polite way . 
  i assume you 're talking about pressing option + something , for things such as accents : \u00e9\u00fc\u00ee\u00e0 , \u00ae \u00a9 \u00b5 \u2202 \u222b \u00f1 etc ? 
  unfortunately , the best way i know of doing this in windows is using alt codes . 
  i copied a few of my most common ones into a document and printed them out , like alt +0150 for -- and alt +1051 for -- ( both not to be confused with - ) , and then taped them onto my desk . 
  you need to have a numpad to use these , as you enter the numbers on that : the number row above letters wo n't work . 
  i imagined [ this ] ( http://nathanconquersuk.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/57765monty-python1.jpg ), 
  absolutely horrid , but it does look beautiful . 
  you got a larger image ? 
  or a short film ? 
  actually , the age of the earth is exactly 4,540,030,005.6 , with 0 error . 
  fact, 
  does n't mean you should destroy someone 's life for a relatively small mistake , though . 
  the op 's case is clearly not a small mistake and should be reported , but in different circumstances ( as was said above , if they 're drunk , but also potentially if they misread you ) it 's not something that should destroy someone 's life . 
  edit : why am i getting downvoted for basically elaborating on what someone else who was massively upvoted for said ? 
  damn ... * i * was going to make a snide remark about your username :(, 
  which is why tomswirly said that they * should * report this behaviour in countries other than the us , where the punishment would be in proportion to the crime . 
  in the us , all `` sexual crimes '' are basically lumped together , meaning that a person who did this would face the same long-term effects as a full-out rapist , which just is n't fair . 
  ( long-term effects as in inability to get jobs , having to report as a sexual offender , etc. , not the initial jail-time or the like ) . 
  what quest is that ? 
  funny that his hat , which has * freaking bells on it * , increases your sneak ability . 
  no , you 're missing my point . 
  is it fair that someone who sends a dirty picture in one drunken stupor should have to live with the `` consequences '' of that for * the rest of their lives * . 
  having to make sure they do n't live in proximity of schools , gyms , bus stops , libraries , etc. , and even having to move if one gets put up near where they live ? 
  every email address and online account must be surrendered to authorities . 
  not to mention that because you 're registered people are going to discriminate against you and look down on you . 
  * even though this was a small offense committed one night in your early 20s * . 
  if you do n't think that punishment is out of proportion for the crime , then i do n't think i can continue this conversation . 
  scandinavia 's too damn cold . 
  [ ahem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teen_mom ), 
  since you do n't seem to have gotten any offers , i 'll put my name forward . 
  i can give you any further details as necessary . 
  i only clicked through to see the comment about breaking his toe , and am ashamed that it 's so far down . 
  yeah definitely !, 
  two of the greatest books written , in my opinion . 
  yeah , i 've heard this , too . 
  made the moment so real !, 
  my version with a forward , prologue , all the appendices , and maps is still under 1200 pages . 
  ah cool, 
   beaten-up , falling apart, 
  describes my harper-collins single edition . 
  but i still love it . 
  even if i decide i need a better quality one , i ca n't ever imagine getting rid of the first book i read lord of the rings in . 
  i 'm not sure where this argument came from ( by which i mean what caused you to bring it up in this thread ) , but i certainly would agree it 's true . 
  i actually just had an interesting conversation with a taiwanese friend of mine , part of which entailed him discovering ( both of us doing random research on the internet as we im ) that the vatican is the only european country that officially recognises taiwan . 
  this is apparently because china does n't support catholicism . 
  i dunno if that means it 's banned , or it 's just not officially recognised , or what , but i just thought it was an interesting point to bring up . 
  to quote the `` note on the text '' at the beginning of my edition ( before the forward and the prologue ) '' * the lord of the rings * is often erroneously called a trilogy , when it is in fact a single novel , consisting of six books plus appendices , sometimes published in three volumes . '', 
  yeah , i really do n't know exactly what he meant by that . 
  it could even be as simple as the catholic church feeling that catholicism in china is too low for their liking , although why that would cause them to support taiwan does n't make sense to me . 
  i 'm sure , it being the vatican , that there 's some sort of ulterior motive to their endorsement , but i guess i ca n't say what it is . 
  hahaha , her books are discounted because they have n't got accurate sales figures . 
  as a series , though , she 's frighteningly high . 
  above james bond , and just below the chronicles of narnia . 
  all of this is very true , and very interesting . 
  i did n't realise there was a distinction between roc and taiwan politically , that 's definitely interesting . 
  what i 'm talking about is something slightly different . 
  within europe ( or the eu , or some specific european denomination ) the only country that * does * recognise taiwan is the vatican . 
  i 'm saying this is n't out of any actual belief that taiwan has a right to be a country , but because the catholic church has some ulterior motive . 
  the hugo award sounds an awful lot like the nobel prize .
