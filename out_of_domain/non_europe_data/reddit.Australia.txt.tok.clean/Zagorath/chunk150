  i ... i think i just managed to read only a single tv trope article . 
  this is n't worded * quite * correctly for the situation , but i wrote it in a similar discussion a little while back , and [ it fits fairly well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/17qz0p/we_lost_the_6th_book_in_the_series_after_two/c882yx3?context=3 ) :, 
   it 's true that this kind of behaviour is n't even close to being `` ocd '' per se , but obsessive compulsiveness is a spectrum , and if this kind of thing bothers you a lot , you are likely higher ( slightly ) on that spectrum than average . 
  this is especially true if you 're likely to have an involuntary , physical ( even a small one ) , reaction to such things . 
  but no , it does n't mean `` you are ocd '' . 
  what did you use to type that ? 
  [ ph\u1edf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pho ) - cd ? 
  this one only works in writing , though ... 
  i 'm the same , though i suspect to a lesser extent . 
  certain things ( if someone was messing with my well set-up computer program , when people miss a spot when rubbing out , a few other things ) cause an involuntary physical reaction that i 'd normally describe as tightening my body up , but squirming in my seat is a good description of how i react , too .

  the los angeles angels . 
  i 'm not sure what 's wrong with this . 
  including falsetto , would a good singer not be able to reach 4 octaves ? 
  i understand that without falsetto you 've got no hope , but this is metal , not classical opera . 
  remember that song from a while back , of an animated steve jobs singing android phone is for porn ? 
  someone needs to do this for bing . 
  yeah sorry , but no . 
  mint is the only linux distro i 've used for more than a few minutes , but it was an absolutely painful experience . 
  i was able to figure my way around it , but there 's absolutely no way my mum could ,, 
  or any of the other people i know who are n't techies . 
  i 've heard ubuntu is better , but i 've never tried it . 
  in the future , perhaps i 'll give it a go , but mint definitely is n't as useable as windows . 
  nope , just last year . 
  had a spare computer lying around , decided to format it and put linux on it . 
  it was fine for me , but it was no where near as useable as windows or os x , and i would n't let my mum anywhere near it . 
  sorry mate , i had never even heard of the term `` lineman '' to refer to a powerline technician . 
  i 'm not even american ( and hence do n't remotely follow american football ) , and the first thing i thought of was the american football position . 
  cool , it was last posted 5 months ago . 
  i 'd say it 's in the clear . 
  that 'd be especially true if you went over there and bought a few other things , too . 
  maybe a copy of office and/or windows , a few games , maybe even a computer . 
  i played the last movement of this last year . 
  it was absolutely stunning . 
  wow , your title hurts my head . 
  no , [ this ] ( http://frankylicio.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/anti-rh-bill-darth-vader-pope-600x841.jpg ) is the next pope, 
  [ yup ] ( http://frankylicio.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/anti-rh-bill-darth-vader-pope-600x841.jpg ), 
  it also works really well with some medical procedures . 
  not the us , but se asia . 
  dental work , eye stuff , things like that . 
  the user i replied to specifically mentioned linux mint being as useable as windows . 
  there 's a difference between jailbreaking and unlocking . 
  well , you do have to jailbreak to unlock on iphone if your carrier/apple wo n't do it , do n't you ? 
  i 'd like to second that request . 
  it does n't * imply * that . 
  it 's explicitly stating that . 
  i have n't used anything other than mint for more than a few minutes . 
  mint , i used quite extensively for a little over a week before the computer it was on got stolen in a burglary . 
  nah man , it 's completely safe , as long as you go to one of the bigger more western-like places . 
  i had my wisdom teeth removed while living in vietnam , and my sister and many friends have had braces out it , regularly adjusted , and eventually removed . 
  the price difference is incredible , and it is honestly completely safe . 
  for my wisdom teeth , it would have literally ( * not * figuratively ) been cheaper to fly there and get the procedure than to get it done in australia . 
  like i said , this is for * small * surgeries . 
  i would n't trust it for a heart bypass or something . 
  i got a [ collection of short films that i 've been involved in ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl609baa1ce3db7fc1 ) , if you 're interested . 
  i know you specifically said feature length films , but how do you like short films ? 
   so studying to them is easy, 
  i wish this was true for me :(, 
  unfortunately , i 've gotten to the point where the majority of music , i * ca n't * listen to while studying . 
  my brain just wants to analyse it . 
  age of empires series . 
  hands down the most awesome there is . 
  also , one of my absolute favourites , a little-known ps2 game called dark cloud . 
  get them to listen to beethoven 's appassionata , or the third movement of `` moonlight '' . 
  and of course a bunch of rachmaninov may be appropriate , too . 
  nearly anything john williams :, 
  * harry potter 1 -- 3, 
  * star wars ( as much flak as the prequels get , episode 2 is my favourite score , and 3 and 5 are also brilliant ), 
  * superman, 
  * indiana jones, 
  * many more , those are just the best overall soundtracks ( a few others have good themes but the soundtrack does n't match up ), 
  also howard shore 's scores to lord of the rings and the hobbit, 
  hans zimmer has some fun scores , but musically they 're no where near the same quality as the above , however you may want to try pirates of the caribbean . 
  i absolutely love hoist the colours , the first track from the 3rd pirates film . 
  `` classical '' can refer to both the `` genre '' as well as the period . 
  as a `` genre '' it refers to anything from the common practice period ( baroque + classical + romantic ) , which means roughly 1600 -- 1900 . 
  it also can often be used to refer to a lot of 20th century so-called `` art '' music , such as shostakovich and stravinsky . 
  the classical era , specifically , is approximately 1750 ~ 1803 , from the death of bach to beethoven 's 3rd symphony . 
  i usually write the specific classical era with a capital c , and the `` genre '' as classical with a lower case c. 
  just for interest 's sake , the reason i write `` genre '' in quotes , is because in common practice period music , genre often refers to something different , which is the type of piece ( example : sonata , symphony , concerto ) . 
  and i disagree about musicians not playing both . 
  many films have used big name orchestras ( example : [ lotr was recorded by london phil ] ( http://www.lpo.org.uk/shop/film.html ) , and the styles are very similar in the highest quality film music , such as that by john williams and howard shore . 
  mars is number 1 in the planets ( edit : oh , and it 's also not a symphony , it 's a suite ) . 
  it is n't based on the astronomical planets , but the astrological ones , and hence goes in order of their distance from earth . 
  if you do n't like bach , have you tried mozart , or beethoven , or tchaikovsky , or stravinsky ? 
  each one of those is as different from the others as nirvana is from madonna . 
  haha awesome !, 
  i 'm a huge fan of short films , any chance you could post it as a reply here or pm me or something when it 's done ( if you 're putting it on youtube or vimeo ) ? 
  if you 're interested , [ here 's a small collection of short films i 've been involved in ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl609baa1ce3db7fc1 ) . 
  absolutely true . 
  however , classical music also loses a lot more than rock does when compressed , so a good quality flac file makes a huge difference compared to 192kbps mp3 . 
  still nothing comparable to a live performance , though . 
  absolutely . 
  those two , plus neptune , are absolutely amazing . 
  i 'm not downvoting anybody , but it probably would have helped if xdewx had explained * why * he thinks it was good . 
   once i left my ipod in the new york metro and when i came back * ten years later * it was gone, 
  there 's no fucking way he 's serious ...
