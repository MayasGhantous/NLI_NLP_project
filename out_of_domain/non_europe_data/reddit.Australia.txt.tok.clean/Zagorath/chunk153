  because i knew i could n't get caught . 
   those are drastically different . 
  in fact that distinction is probably the biggest question, 
  agreed, 
   i 'd sort of blame both, 
  i 'd say could be both ** or ** either , depending on the circumstances . 
  if it 's because the customer did n't want to spend the money on it , it 's their fault . 
  if it 's because it was n't available , it 's the fault of the industry . 
  if it 's because they did n't have the money , it could be seen as both ( the product is overpriced , but also the customer does n't necessarily have the right to access something they ca n't afford ) . 
  i 'm a little confused as to what should happen . 
  i signed up on the website , got an email from someone called john @ echo , which started with `` hi there !, 
  thank you for your interest in our research '' . 
  now what do i do ? 
  the email had neither a further link to the pre-experiment survey or to download the app , nor any instruction on what to do or expect next . 
  will i be getting another email soon ? 
  should i reply back to the email address ? 
  the little that i 've read so far , though , seems like it 'll be an interesting study . 
  cheers, 
  agnostic atheists are all intelligent atheists . 
  they recognise that they can not know for certain if there is some sort of omnipotent deity ( or theity ) , but they believe that the overwhelming lack if evidence that such a being exists must lead to the conclusion that there probably is n't such a being . 
  hey , i honestly never did until like 2 or 3 months after graduating high school . 
  most of them are still probably lying , though . 
  i have never done this or thought of doing this before . 
  i will from now on . 
  thank you . 
  is this really true ? 
  i had my nexus 4 out in a moderate amount of rain ( definitely more than a `` drizzle '' , but not pouring either ) without an umbrella , and the screen did n't work well while i was doing it , but a few minutes after i was out of the rain it was absolutely fine again . 
  the same was true with my ipod touch 3rd gen , although i feel its screen fared better even while wet . 
  then we the user do n't blame you , we blame the money guy . 
  even in the case that we do n't know who to blame , it 's not you that will lose a customer for it , it 's the guy you 're working for . 
  but yeah , even as someone who is n't a developer , it does n't make sense to me how many times i hear people not listening to the advice of the guy they 're paying to do something in their area of expertise . 
  i dunno about duct tape , but that 's actually something that significantly lessens my interest in doing archery ( though it 'd still be super awesome ) . 
  i know that the modern bows that they use are far from * easy * per se , but it just seems , psychologically , as though it 's a hell of a lot less cool than using a wooden recurve bow or something similar . 
  you 're right , it was entertaining . 
  thank you . 
  i had my cake day a little while ago and completely did n't notice it ... 
  ah yes , where do you think the name * hammerklavier * came from, 
  kinda like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pylguhiz9j4#t=157s ) ? 
  ( p.s. , huge props to anyone that can tell me what the piece they 're playing here is called ! ), 
  to be fair , people would probably be a lot less inclined to sleep to it if it were played at the correct tempo . 
  it 's adagio * a la breve * . 
  that means the tempo should be adagio when the bars are measured two beats to a bar , so the * minums * are adagio . 
  this means about 50 -- 60 minums per minute , or 100 -- 120 ( probably on the lower end of that ) crotchet beats per minute . 
  most people tend to play something more like 80 or even less crotchet beats per minute , which does make this absolutely beautiful piece of music sound somewhat `` boring '' . 
  engineering at my uni ( and , to be honest , i think all programmes ) require non-graphical calculators . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/student-centre/docs/exams/approved-calculators.pdf ) 's our list of approved calculators . 
  * sigh *, 
  i 've tried a couple of times to read the silmarillion . 
  i really want to get through it . 
  but it 's just so damn heavy and complicated , i ca n't get myself to get through it . 
  just an fyi , the lord of the rings is actually considered a single novel , consisting of * six * books plus appendices . 
  so it 's either 2/22 or 8/27 , depending on how you count it , but certainly not 5/24 . 
  oh wow , thanks !, 
  i 've read enough of the silmarillion to understand why it is people draw parallels between christianity and the creation of e\u00e4 , but i just do n't buy into it . 
  i mean , yeah i can see where there a similarities , but it also all seems far too different for me . 
  yes there 's a one god , but i ca n't really think of any christian equivalent of eru sending the valar to create and manage the world . 
  i would n't say damn , necessarily . 
  8/27 is actually a much higher percentage done !, 
  how long have you guys had rfid cards ? 
  i recently moved back to brisbane , australia , where our transport department has had what it calls `` go cards '' ( i have no idea if they use rfid , or some other technology , but i would assume it 's rfid ) for quite a while , and they 're bloody amazing !, 
  the actual transport is n't great outside of major areas , but the payment system is awesome , and i just wish it worked state - or even country-wide . 
  i do n't know how reliable the cards were when they first started out using them , but i imagine it probably was n't a very smooth transition . 
  perhaps if you give it some time it will improve in holland , because the * idea * of it is certainly brilliant . 
  i do n't know if such a thing exists , but i would definitely also like to see it . 
  i tried putting `` rope '' into google translate ( french -  english ) , and it actually came up with `` europe '' ... 
  is that an actual irony mark in the wild, 
  well , the part about flushing the other way is n't true . 
  my thought when i saw this comment :, 
   please be animal farm , please be animal farm , please be animal farm \\* * click * \\* animal farm !, 
  this thread is getting a serious animal farm vibe to it ... 
  that does n't explain shostakovich , though , whose music is every bit as accessible as stravinsky 's and just as `` good '' . 
  here : ), 
  and almost all of europe , as well as new zealand and many australian states . 
  wtf is diagramming a sentence ? 
  actually , in many cases they * do * want people using the busses . 
  less cars on the roads means less need for larger road infrastructure etc. , and also less congestion in the city . 
  ( and , obviously , more people on busses means less cars on the roads . ), 
  ** $ 3.28 ** in brisbane for an adult with a go card ( electronic ticketing system for all public transport in the city , unlike some other cities i 've heard of , it actually works really well ) . 
  ** $ 4.80 ** without one . 
  concession ( including students ) is only $ 1.64 with go card , so that 's nice . 
  both of those prices are if you only travel within one zone . 
  larger distances cost more . 
  huh . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever heard of that method before . 
  interesting . 
  busses over here in brisbane are n't subsidised , though students pay concession prices , which are significantly cheaper than adult prices . 
  i think my uni might have its own private inter-campus shuttle , which may or may not be free , but i do n't really know , having never needed to go to a different campus . 
  in my city busses do n't give any change , but then we 've also got an amazing transport card system ( though exact fare was still required before that was introduced ) , so they can charge irregular amounts ( like $ 3.28 ) , whereas without the card you pay a much easier amount to pay exactly ( $ 4.80 , aus has 20c not 25 ) . 
  it 's still over $ 300,000, 
  this is the right answer, 
  i have seen australians living overseas call them cookies before . 
  it may have been some misguided attempt at allowing others to know what they were talking about , but that does n't make it any less blasphemous to me . 
  oh , and gallipolli is pronounced ga - ** lip ** - o - li , not ** ga ** - li - ** po ** - li ( which is how i 've seen many non aussies/kiwis pronounce it upon first reading ) . 
  as much as it annoys me when i see australians ( or people in australia ) saying `` zee '' , i have to hand it to the yanks , that really makes sense . 
  all the other cadential points in the alphabet rhyme with / i\u02d0 / ( i.e. , g , p , v , are d\u0292i\u02d0 , pi\u02d0 , and vi\u02d0 , respectively ) , so it does seem random to end with z\u025bd . 
  i 'll still be saying zed , though ( with the exception of * some * brands , such as dragonball z ) . 
  sure thing . 
  sonata-allegro form ( also known simply as sonata form ) is an incredibly common form in a wide variety of music , and often is the form used in the first movements of sonatas ( like piano sonatas ) and symphonies . 
  it has the form of :,
