    ** theme a ** ( or the first set of ideas ) in the tonic key ( i.e. , the main key of the movement : if the movement is in c major , the tonic key is c major ), 
    ** bridge ** from theme a to theme b, 
    ** theme b ** ( or the second set of ideas ) in the dominant key ( i.e. , the fifth , so if the tonic is c major , the dominant is g major , just count up five ) , or sometimes the relative major , if the tonic is minor ( i.e. , the major key with the same key signature , e.g. 
  a minor has zero sharps or flats , the relative major is c major , which also has zero sharps or flats . 
  d minor -  f major , both have one flat ) . 
   ** development ** , where the composer goes wild and does whatever they want using the ideas outlined in the exposition, 
   ** recapitulation **, 
    ** theme a ** , again in the tonic, 
    ** bridge ** , altered so that it can bridge from a to the new theme b , which will be in the tonic . 
  this is what i the comic refers to by `` that one bar '' , though it may in fact be a bit more than one bar . 
    ** theme b ** , now in the tonic key . 
  ( if theme a was minor and theme b was previously relative major , it will now be the parallel major , i.e. , the major key starting on the same note , e.g. 
  a minor would go from c major previously to a major now , note that the number of sharps or flats will change ) . 
   ** coda ** , to end the piece, 
  edit : i ca n't think of any examples of `` that one bar '' off the top of my head , but check the comments for this post on [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/dontshootthepianist ) . 
  by the way , if you do n't already , it 's an [ amazing comic ] ( http://euge.ca/ ) to read for musicians . 
  i often have to check facebook to find out what he 's referring to , though . 
  the comments here mention mozart k. 545 , mozart k. 488 , chopin concerto no 1 , as well as [ this ] ( http://wandererandfantasy.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/indeed.html ) blog post with a specific example . 
  jost michaels was an excellent player , but was even better known as professor in detmold , germany , where he focussed on playing technique . 
  on this subject he has published a ( german ) book spieltechnik . 
  he played piano and clarinet and was one of the only people ever to receive a double professorship in both instruments in germany . 
  he recorded extensively on both instruments , published many articles on musical subjects and arranged numerous works for clarinet . 
  he was also quite proficient on the violin . 
  professor michaels was uncompromising in his desire to bring out the best of every piece he played . 
  he was a champion of unknown composers and their works , believing that one can not understand the greatness of masterpieces if one does not have a thorough knowledge of the other works of their time , and of the composers who , from our point of view , stand almost hidden in the shadows of the masters . 
  that 's all i could find about him , really . 
  let us know what the recording is like !, 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know what you mean . 
  jumpy ? 
   but , importantly , do not currently exist, 
  this was the first thing that popped into my mind when i saw that question . 
  they do n't exist , how the hell am i supposed to judge it ? 
  yeah exactly , it 's really vague . 
  one could interpret it the way you have , but one could equally interpret it as assuming the question is asked from a point in the future where fusion power is commonplace and safe . 
  i ca n't speak for this specific situation , but in high school i had a number of situations where the teacher was adamant the date was always one day , when i ( and/or some other students ) were sure it was another day . 
  i 'm really consistent at writing down deadlines and stuff , so the only way i would get this wrong is if either the teacher spoke incorrectly , or i heard it incorrectly . 
  either case is simply an honest mistake , and no one has done anything seriously wrong , or deserves to be called names . 
  that said , i 'm a big proponent of the teacher writing the date clearly on the board , as well as saying it out loud . 
  then there can be no confusion ( at least not as easily ) . 
  if you 're on a mac , do the function keys perform their os x functions , or do they perform their function functions ? 
  if the former , try holding the fn key in addition to the others in the shortcut . 
  by the way , do save files from warband for windows work on the os x version ? 
  my gaming pc 's being fixed at the moment , and i 'm only left with my mac laptop , but it 'd be nice to be able to continue playing ( i have the save file stored externally ) . 
  this is the first i 've heard of a mac version of warband . 
  i just use the ones in sibelius , though i 'm having heaps of problems since i upgraded to sibelius 7 . 
  if we 're getting technical , just remember you 're voting for the representative of * your electorate * , who , while in a party at the moment , has no legal requirement to vote on party lines and could potentially choose to leave said party ( as unlikely as it is in most cases ) . 
  he was making a joke about the ambiguity of the word `` its '' in the title . 
  it is meant to refer to * google * 's customers , but grammatically could also refer to the fbi 's customers , which is what dahood was pointing out . 
  might * have **, 
  but for me , it was her this season as well . 
  i absolutely love the arc she went through in the first half of this season , it was a brilliant example of why this show is so great . 
  i hated beetle at first ( all that faux-mexican stuff ... ) , but damn his character 's arc in the middle to latter half of what we 've seen this series so far has just been brilliant . 
  you can call yourself a lefty or ambidextrous , there 's no real requirements on it , so it 's mainly about self-identification . 
  however , if the only reason you write righty is because you were forced to learn that way , you probably would be more correct in calling yourself a lefty . 
  by the way , your kindergarten teacher was an arsehole . 
  coupla questions . 
  who are andrew and you ? 
  and what do you mean by `` the reports '' ? 
  are there already rumours about what l desert android will be named after ? 
  i would 've thought it 's more likely to be version 5.1 or something ( near-complete speculation based solely on what they did with 4.0 and 4.1 ) , but i agree , android l has to be lamington !, 
  is that like the rspca ? 
  coos they 've never made me cry once . 
  i know gates and clinton , but who are the others ? 
  the ones on the left are too blurry for me to make out ( probably also because i just do n't know them , or do n't know them * well * ) , and i just plain do n't know the guy on the far right . 
  edit : but yes , this is hilarious !, 
  ca n't decide if this or op is better . 
  eh , i feel like posters seems funnier . 
  same as him , though , it 's probably bias because i 've seen op 's sign in person , but this is my first time seeing the one about stickers . 
  just so we all know , a bassoon is also known as a fagott , one g , two ts . 
  a pejorative term for gay people is faggot , two gs , one t. 
  * the * word . 
  i never knew they did n't have alphabetised dessert names for a and b. 
  cool !, 
  yes, 
  antarctic , bitch !, 
  i think it 's an alternate spelling of ` straya !, 
  11:30 pm right now est, 
  my vote goes for lamington , but if i were a betting man , my money would be on lollipop . 
  you 've never been to vietnam , then !, 
  it 's funny because it 's getting dumbed down so much , it makes sense to name it after a tamer animal . 
  nice try , kiwi, 
  i dunno , froyo and honeycomb are pretty cool names even without the theme , i think . 
  but then , at least in the case of froyo , that 's something i had never heard of before hearing the android version , so i 'm used to it as a codename * more * than as a dessert . 
  about what ? 
  about not knowing the people ? 
  yeah , i am . 
  i think it 's a bit unfair that i 'm being downvoted for not knowing a couple of celebrities , but such is the nature of reddit , i suppose . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sting.ogg :d, 
  actually , i really like a lot of apple products . 
  i just thought it was funny . 
  one could equally ( or perhaps * moreso * ) so that windows is also getting dumbed down . 
  it 's not a view i actually subscribe to -- in either of the cases -- but it is one i understand . 
  i 'd like to throw it out there ( although i thought it would have been obvious ) , if anyone does know who those other people are , i 'd like to know it . 
  how about rather than all downvoting ( despite it being clearly against rediquette ) , you actually do something constructive yourselves and help a guy out ... ? 
  why did you have to `` catch '' them ? 
  surely it 's a private establishment , and you do n't really need grounds to expel them . 
  if you know they 're doing something wrong , even if you ca n't prove it , surely you have the right to make them leave ? 
  i do . 
  it does n't say anything about it . 
  i usually try not to do it , though , because admittedly it is a bit odd .
