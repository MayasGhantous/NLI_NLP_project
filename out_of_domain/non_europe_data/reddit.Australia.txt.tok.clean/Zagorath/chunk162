  ( not to mention , it 's really bizarre ... ), 
  did they also change how many times you can miss ? 
  `` you can only miss twice '' implies that miss once and you can continue . 
  miss a second time and you can continue . 
  the next time you miss , you lose . 
  `` miss twice and your [ sic ] out '' implies that on the second time you miss , you lose . 
  exactly , and you are n't allowed to miss thrice . 
  you * can * miss twice , which implies that it 's * ok * to miss twice , without penalty . 
  or , you know , healthy plant life . 
  if you 're gon na put in some religious mumbo jumbo , you should remember that in religion , when referring to god , they usually capitalise `` he '' , `` his '' , etc. 
  rotated funny + poor image quality + cursive makes this extremely painful ( although certainly not impossible ) to try and read . 
  thank you kind sir for the transcription . 
  what do you mean it 's happening automatically ? 
  i 'm assuming this works in a similar way to 9gag . 
  the website has been designed to place a watermark on anything that a user submits to the site , in order to drive traffic back to said site when the image is further shared ( e.g. 
  on reddit -- as was the case here -- or facebook ) . 
  sure , on each image it is an automatic process , but it 's been manually designed to do that . 
  these websites are complete jerks . 
  i thought this was funny , but it 's clearly failed here . 
  try reposting to / r/classicalmemes, 
  he said iirc , i 'm just gon na come and state that he * does * remember correctly . 
  that is indeed what the finn brothers ' have stated was their reason . 
  that , as well as the fact that they happened to really like sibelius ( this one is iirc ) . 
  i , also , am a staunch beethoven man , but along with those you 've already listened to , you really * must * hear mozart 's requiem . 
  it 's one of the finest pieces ever written , in my opinion , and certainly mozart 's greatest work . 
  i may go into more detail later if you want , but that article by alex ross has some serious flaws in its comparison , and while his comments regarding * shore 's * influences by wagner are mostly accurate ( he destroyed his validity in my eyes in the last paragraph , describing shore 's score as `` mickey-mousing at an exalted level '' ) , he repeatedly gets it wrong regarding * tolkien * . 
  ah cheers . 
  you 'll tend to find this is the case . 
  people who have used windows 8 , * and actually given it a fair go * ( as opposed to using it but hating on it the whole time ) will tend to find it just fine . 
  it 's a great operating system , and quite frankly if you * choose * to buy windows 7 at this point ( either as an upgrade from xp/vista / \\* gasp \\* earlier , or with a new computer ) , you 're just being stupid . 
  happy cake day !, 
  not displaying yet as it 's only 4am in utc +10 , so reddit 's servers will be a few hours away from your cakeday . 
  but yeah , i 'm a little over a year old and i 've also just found this out . 
  holy hell . 
  he cut it in half before sticking the bits back together . 
  i feel like a better and more realistic way of examining students would be to * give * them a formula booklet , and they need to know how to apply those formulae . 
  that 's how i 've always seen it done , and honestly to me it seems to make far more sense . 
  in `` real life '' ( as though school/uni are n't real life ... ) you 're not going to have to have any formulae memorised , but you will need to know how to use them . 
  yeah , everything i saw when deciding my uni programme made it seem that software engineering and computer science were more or less interchangeable , just that se tended to be the one that was more desirable . 
  ianal , but would n't you be protected by safe harbour laws , assuming you removed it all as soon as you were contacted ? 
  fellow aus here . 
  from everything i 've read on reddit and elsewhere , it seems that the us has a ridiculous emphasis on `` states ' rights '' in general . 
  not just regarding this issue , but a huge range of issues also including taxation ( arguably the worst offense ) , education , healthcare , and drugs . 
  it 's an absolutely stupid , outdated , notion , and one that i 'm glad we only have to a lesser degree ( though still , in my opinion , too much ) . 
   and sometimes i think he took me in so that i could spend a few days away from the hell that i called home, 
  pretty sure that 's it . 
  could someone explain these `` portal farms '' to me ? 
  i 've been seeing it all over the ingress subreddits , but do n't understand what it means . 
  then you are a good person ( edit : at least in that respect , i obviously do n't know you at all and ca n't make a more general claim ) . 
  i do n't doubt that the majority of hindus are exactly the same . 
  however , i suspect there are a number of hindus who * would * look down on a person for eating cow . 
  this is what he was getting at , i think . 
  many people * will * disrespect others because they do n't conform with their beliefs . 
  while this is n't the majority , it can often ( / r/atheism ) be a rather outspoken minority . 
  it 's nice to actually * see * the silent majority like is happening in this thread . 
  questions 7 and 8 seem * very * poorly fitted towards someone who listens to classical music . 
  who is the `` artist '' ? 
  the composer , the orchestra , the conductor ? 
  otherwise , cool survey , and i look forward to the results . 
  i ca n't say anything about the accepted chronology ( not reading any comics or watching any other dc shows ) , however from a literary standpoint , i feel it would be * far * too rushed to introduce * yet another * robin so soon . 
  the second robin has n't been developed all that much yet , and even if he was 3 robins in 3 seasons is a bit much . 
  what the rant videos have quickly become some of my favourite tobuscus vids , up with the literal trailers ( how i first found him ) , a few of his songs , and the animated ones with gabe uscus . 
  eh , he 's the one being a jerk , getting all passive agressive about people making a joke . 
  another great option is audiobooks . 
  i do n't listen to any myself , though . 
  the number of podcasts i listen to would mean i would n't have enough time in a week to add anything more . 
  i think he means the one the gif was taken from . 
  oh no , i totally understand the history of it . 
  i made sure to specifically mention outdated for just that reason . 
  it makes sense taken in a historical context , however it is n't appropriate for the modern political and economic climate . 
  that was my first thought , too . 
  holy hell . 
  that said , based on the size of the writing and stuff , i 'd guess those are pretty large strawberries , but still ... 
  not a meme , but i agree . 
  / r/classicalmemes is another appropriate location . 
  i ca n't say i 've seen this specific combination , but i 've seen heaps of bizarre stuff of a similar sort in asia . 
  speaking of which , are there any portal mods currently other than shields ? 
  .000005645 , so 6e-6 , not 5e-6 , after rounding . 
  just so you know , people can pick more than one option here . 
  based on what the question is , i do n't think you want that . 
  ah , i do n't know . 
  i tried selecting multiple , but undid it before submitting because i did n't want to mess up the results . 
  may just be a quirk in surveymonkey . 
  personally i think america takes free speech * too * far in some cases , but much of europe goes too far the other way . 
  i 'd certainly much rather be on the us 's side of that debate . 
  i agree , this comment is brilliant and deserves to be at the top , but did you really need to be such a douche about the other commentors who are , after all , only trying to help ? 
  of course , you can get around quick saving being abused by requiring that the player not be in a battle in order to use it ( or certain other circumstances as applicable ) . 
  is that the opposite of an antheist ? 
  actually , he 's got a bit of a point . 
  if it 's streaming what it records directly to the internet , even if you are forced to stop , what 's already there will stay there . 
  they ca n't destroy your camera in order to prevent you sharing . 
  i would trust a computer to drive a car a hell of a lot more if everyone 's doing it ( though i , like you , would already trust a computer a heap by itself ) . 
  imagine , they 're all networked and know exactly where every other car within a 50m radius is . 
  [ well , most of them ] ( https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/nexus_4_16gb?id=nexus_4_16gb&amp;hl=en ), 
  ah , so you 've managed to try every possible combination of 5 digits ? 
  maybe old you was n't a troll , but just did n't understand `` digit '' and instead meant `` character '' ? 
   * having the conductor speak to the audience directly to introduce and talk about the music . 
  point 1 is amazing . 
  the conductor of my old local amateur choir and orchestra ( which i played in ) would do this throughout concerts all the time . 
  it made for an absolutely great experience .
