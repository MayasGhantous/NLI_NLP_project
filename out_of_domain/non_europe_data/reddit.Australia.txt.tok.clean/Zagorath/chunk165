  are we talking about scammers , or just poor-quality tech support ? 
  has n't been loading * any * pages properly for me since i made that comment ... have they finally caught on to the current date ? 
  no unlimited storage . 
  dedicated app ? 
  on android the gmail app is the main one , so not really ... on ios though , unfortunately the built-in mail app is terrible for gmail . 
  same with all the desktop mail clients out there . 
  spam filter ? 
  it 's got the best one out there . 
  the biggest advantage of it ? 
  labels and filters . 
  labels work so much better than folders in any of the other email services , allowing you to apply multiple labels to a single email in a centralised location . 
  filters are awesome for automatically applying labels . 
  it 's also got great search for you to find your email with if you do n't want to use labels ( or have too many within a single label to find the right one by eye ) . 
  i highly doubt reddit plans on making an official app . 
  as someone who recently got his first smartphone , moving to a nexus 4 from an ipod touch , i fucking loved alien blue , and i wish there was an app on android that even came close . 
  i use reddit is fun , because of the apps i 've tried ( others are baconreader and reddit sync ) it was the least awful ( and by a large margin , both of those others are absolutely shit ) . 
  if it had become ubiquitous , it could have been used to completely replace email , im , and google docs-style collaborative stuff , all in one nice centralised location . 
  except buzz actually was shit . 
  wave was amazingly awesome , had so much potential ( could have replaced email , im , and google docs ) . 
  reader was great and was by far the most popular rss reader out there , and i have to admit it really confuses me that google would get rid of this one . 
  g + , as everyone knows , basically takes the same functionality as facebook . 
  what people do n't necessarily realise is * just how much * *** better *** * it is * . 
  circles are amazing for having full control of your sharing . 
  hangouts are just epicly awesome , and the new events feature is really awesome ( even without integration to google calendar , which is an added bonus ) . 
  not to mention its interface , which is much nicer than facebook 's . 
  unfortunately , g + suffers from a ( both perceived and real ) lack of users . 
  perceived , because there actually are a lot of people using it , but real because those people are n't the people i know in real life . 
  g + can be great if you give it a chance and join some communities relating to your interests ( i 'm in a number of ingress-related communities , a number of communities related to podcasts and internet shows i listen to or watch , as well as a few about my hobbies/interests ) . 
  communities are , for the moment , the only real way to get some proper interaction on g + unless you happen to be lucky enough to convince your friends to join up and use it regularly , but they are actually really cool and fun . 
  i also occasionally have hangouts with friends who never use g + otherwise , but it 's great for multi-way video chats . 
  / random rant about g +, 
  g + but shitty was google buzz , another product that failed around the same time as wave . 
  wave is difficult to explain , but had it become ubiquitous , it could have theoretically taken the roles of email , im , and document collaboration ( a la google docs ) , all into one centralised location . 
  it did get the real-time document editing features , but i heard that they do n't even use the same code for that . 
  re reader, 
  i 'm honestly surprised so many people cared about the social features of google reader . 
  for me it 's always been like an email inbox of things i 'm interested in . 
  not something to be shared with the world . 
  but i do feel for those that lost features they care about , and indeed since reader 's announced it 's end-of-lifing , the product i 've moved to has been one that was created [ specifically because of the loss of reader 's social features ] ( http://theoldreader.com ) . 
  but the reason its end-of-life surprises me is that it contains so much data . 
  it 's essentially a massive list of all the things that interest me in a completely honest way . 
  the list websites that i have specified i read ( or at the very least scan ) every article on is something that i would have thought is worth a hell of a lot to google in its quest for ever more relevant ads . 
  re wave, 
  you say it would never have replaced email or im for you . 
  why is that ? 
  think about it , you could have had a single location for all of those things , and theoretically without losing any of the actual features of those separate products . 
  how is that anything but a good thing . 
  this is , of course , assuming that they had planned on improving it to the point it was at feature-parity with gmail and popular im clients . 
  re g +, 
  yeah , facebook has lists , but they 're an absolute pain to use , even if you know how to . 
  the automatic lists are really nice , but since a lot of people at my university or living in my city do n't have the information listed on their profile correctly , even the automatic lists are basically useless . 
  and that 's assuming you even know how to and want to use them , which as you said , most people do n't . 
  as far as i can tell , though , the way g + has done events really is new . 
  facebook events does n't have the photo features built in to g + ( `` party mode '' ) , and it does n't allow you to specify you 're bringing a +1 ( or +2 , +3 , etc. ) . 
  i ca n't say i 've looked in to g + login . 
  whenever login using google is an option , i use it just because of the convenience , but i do n't know what advantages it could give compared to facebook . 
  i 'd be interested in knowing , though , if you 've got the time to explain . 
  regarding microexpressions , i just found out about them on an episode of qi i saw recently . 
  i do n't remember the exact stat , but it 's amazingly rare how many people with that ability there are . 
  congrats on being one of the lucky few !, 
  out of interest , which type of syn\u00e6sthesia do you have ? 
  decent shot with a bow or a gun ? 
  it 's important !, 
  then you have 128 people at 90kg each , that 's over 11 tonnes . 
  even so , a small weight difference does actually make a big difference in cost . 
  1kg less per flight has been estimated to result in thousands of dollars saved per year . 
  i did n't do it , but i sent a link to this thread to someone who did . 
  here are her responses verbatim . 
   never wan na hear anything about it again, 
   ever . 
   i swear to god, 
   il kill people . 
  asked her if she could provide more insight, 
   im sorry , no . 
  sorry i could n't help much more , but there you go . 
  actually , tolkien has specifically stated that he had no real world events in mind as he wrote the lord of the rings . 
  i 'm curious , as someone who has n't read that book , how can it be that the hobbits ' actions were a minor part ? 
  frodo and sam took the ring itself to be destroyed . 
  merry and pippin were involved in things such as convincing the ents to attack isengard , the lighting of the beacon , and the defeat of the witch king . 
  all of these activities , to my mind ( again , not having read the book yet ) indicates that the hobbits play a major role in the war of the ring . 
  well that was fucking pointless . 
  i click on it since this post said `` 18 years or older '' , then get into the actual thing and it asks if i 'm 19 or older . 
  to which i ( honestly ) reply no . 
  at which point it kicks me out . 
  you had better bloody not . 
  i do n't want anyone spoiling the noble cause of the enlightened by blackening our name through cheating . 
  yup , l5 here , got an invite . 
  right , good spot , but that still implies that it wants people 18 or older , even if a literal interpretation shows that that is wrong . 
  really poorly worded title . 
  yeah it 's a game . 
  and i fucking hate cheaters . 
  i worded it in a way that fits `` in-universe '' , but it basically says do n't be a douche by cheating . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's joking , anyway , which would make this all moot . 
  shame that the trays are all wet . 
  ** thank you for this ** . 
  i ca n't believe i had to go 24 top level comments down before i found a comment that actually explains what the fuck `` new game + '' actually is . 
  thanks for the great explanation . 
  if you can get a mole into the g + group , fair game i say . 
  if you can con an enemy agent to tell you something in person , fair game . 
  but having a second account is directly in violation of the game 's tos , and is therefore cheating .
