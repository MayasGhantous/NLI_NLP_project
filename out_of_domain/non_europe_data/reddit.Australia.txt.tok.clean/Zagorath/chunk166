  that 's not up for debate . 
   methods of cheating , unfortunately , are limited only by cheaters ' imaginations , but include at a minimum the following : playing with multiple accounts ( one account per player , please ) ; sharing accounts ; using tools or techniques to alter or falsify your location ; or selling or trading accounts . 
  whether getting into the g + group would be considered cheating is up for debate , i would n't consider it to be so , considering if you have n't cheated in order to get a second account , it should be easy for g + mods to screen out people trying to do so , and considering the g + groups are n't really an `` official '' part of the game . 
  i 've been around / r/gaming for quite a while , and / r/games for almost as long , and this is literally ( and i do mean literally , not figuratively ) the first time i 've ever come across the term . 
  on reddit , i 've usually come to expect that terms and references that not even will understand will usually be explained somewhere near the top . 
  even in cases where the reference is * extremely * widely known , someone usually explains it because [ not everyone knows or can be expected to know all these references ] ( http://xkcd.com/1053/ ) . 
  thanks for the wikipedia link , though . 
  really helpful !, 
  is that just `` logarithms '' , or does \ud568\uc218 mean something separate ? 
  but it is n't a * conflict of interests * . 
  if the abc took ads , it may impact the impartiality of its reporting such that it would refuse to report negatively about its advertisers . 
  the bom does n't have that issue . 
  it 's simply reporting facts . 
  all ads , everywhere , should follow these rules . 
  i 'm looking at you , youtube . 
  if the department of health were sponsored by kellogg 's , that would be a conflict of interests , because it could influence how they behave in a detrimental way . 
  ads on the bom website do n't have that issue , because the bom just takes data recorded from its sensors and presents the data in a convenient format . 
  there 's no editorialising , nothing that could be negatively affected by ads . 
  ( sorry if i spelt that wrong , been a while since i was in korea ), 
  this is both not a vertical , and incredibly unfunny . 
  what ? 
  lotr takes place in a world/time where ents and magic rings do exist . 
  comparing to ww2 and hitler is completely irrelevant and unnecessary . 
  fairy tales do n't win wars in real life , but in e\u00e4 they do . 
  agreed . 
  i was tempted to say `` somewhat wrong/immoral '' for wearing jeans 3 weeks , just because it 's gross/wrong , but it is n't in any way immoral , so i answered `` not wrong at all ; perfectly okay '' , which really is n't an accurate assessment . 
  similar with the tattoo question , and doubtless there will be many more ( i 'm currently still going through it ) . 
  edit : the one about buying a car , taking an elevator , there 's just way too many of them . 
  i just ca n't complete this survey . 
  sorry op , but you need to fix your wording . 
  it 's the korean character for which the closest latin equivalent is `` k '' . 
  they use it to simulate laughing , like we would use `` hahahaha '', 
  i definitely ca n't find the hotword detection option . 
  what exact process do you go through to find it ? 
  i 've tried going to google now , clicking the settings , and then google now , it only shows up with a list of cards that i can have , and then the very bottom it has notification settings . 
  alternatively , i can go to google now , click settings , then voice , i get options for `` language '' , `` voice output '' ( i have set to always , the only other option is hands-free only ) , `` block offensive words '' , and `` download offline speech recognition '' . 
  regarding the punctuation , i definitely ca n't do colons , and i 've managed to get period to work , but it 's incredibly inconvenient to use what is essentially a made-up command in order to insert a specified punctuation mark ( i understand in the us they normally call full stops `` periods '' , but i 've got my device set to australian english , not us english , and it 's rather disappointing they have n't got that working properly ) . 
  i 'm not very hopeful , but i do n't suppose you 'd know of a way to fix this ? 
  cheers for the help , though !, 
  i actually * only * have adblock installed at all because youtube was pissing me off so much . 
  i recently moved to australia from vietnam , and in vietnam you would * occasionally * get a preroll ad before a select number of music videos , and otherwise the only ads you 'd ever see were small square ones to the side of the video , and the little ones that pop up at the bottom of the video about 10 seconds in . 
  coming back to australia , ** massive ** banner ad on the home page , prerolls on nearly every video , i just got so pissed at it i went and installed adblock . 
  i hate that i had to do that , because i think blocking ad revenue is wrong : most sites on the web are free only because they display ads , and using a site that that is free because of ads , without seeing the ads , is just wrong . 
  the exception to that is when , like youtube , a site goes too far with ads to the point where it is incredibly annoying to use . 
  yes , it does . 
  if you saw a sign at a venue that said `` must be over 18 to enter '' , you would assume that 18 year olds are allowed to go in . 
  if you want to think of it logically , you are `` over 18 '' exactly one nano second after midnight on your 18th birthday , but that 's not really the way it should be thought about . 
  it 's just a matter of common practice . 
  hmm ... that 's interesting . 
  yeah , i 've got android 4.2.2 , i 've just made sure all my google apps were up to date in the play store ( including ones i never use , like currents ) . 
  i go to that same menu you 've described , and i definitely only have a handful of those options ... language , speech output , block offensive words , and download offline speech recognition . 
  i 'm gon na go through the rest of the phone 's settings and see if there 's something i can play with , but it 's possible that google 's decided for some reason to block this feature overseas . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  are they really ? 
  centimetres are smaller than inches , thus you end up with a larger number . 
  and is n't that a good thing ? 
  i 'm not even going to get into why this common argument by fahrenheit enthusiasts just does n't hold water . 
  oh believe me when i say it 's incredibly easy . 
  i lived in korea for three years , and i can read the characters ( as in , know how to pronounce it ) but i would n't have a fucking clue what most of it meant . 
  after that i lived in vietnam for 5 years , same deal ( except i actually have * less * of a clue how to pronounce it , thanks to all the convoluted accents ) . 
  you tend to only live , work , and otherwise interact with other expats . 
  the locals tend to speak enough english that you can get in a taxi , order food , and the like , and even aside from that you will generally pick up on a few words that help with those simple tasks . 
  it 's a bit sad , really , when you think about it -- living in a foreign country but still living in a bubble of your own culture -- but that 's the way it is for almost all expats . 
  i think media has always done this , but people have been dropping them a lot recently as a prank . 
  am i the only one really disappointed with how they look ? 
  this . 
  if he 's using a second account , but you do n't know what that account is , report his main one . 
  if you 're lucky that account will be banned/suspended , leaving the game to be played by people who want to play the game as a game . 
  as overlordror said , woo is n't disney . 
  the original film was produced by mgm . 
  * return to oz * ( 1985 ) and this year 's * oz the great and powerful * were produced by disney , though . 
  no , only, 
   it will soon make its way from chromium to the various chrome release channels , so users will see the first blink-powered version of chrome appear on their desktops , phones and tablets in the near future . 
  i dunno , i 've seen a ** lot ** more of them since the 1.22.0 update . 
  as far as i can gather , 0.290 is * sieverts * , but that 25 is microsieverts , or 0.025 sieverts . 
  i could be wrong , this is just based on my understanding of his comment . 
  how is he trying to gain readers for his blog ? 
  sure , he 's got links to it , but is there really anything wrong with that ? 
  trey ratcliff is an amazing photographer , who 's just come here to reddit to share his work . 
  if you check his history , he 's actually a pretty frequent redditor . 
  he 's also very well known and generally respected in social media , especially g + . 
  honestly , i do n't understand why reddit 's being so fucking douchy over this . 
  it honestly makes me a bit embarrassed to call myself a redditor . 
  edit : to be honest , it seems like you 're acting as though this is some joe-blow blogger who 's decided to spam reddit to get more views . 
  that 's absolutely not the case . 
  if you followed him , you 'd know he 's just really enthusiastic about photography , and he 's a really great guy . 
  he 's also far from joe-blow . 
  he 's one of the most famous photographers currently alive , and certainly on the internet . 
  his views on piracy [ line up with reddit 's perfectly ] ( https://plus.google.com/u/0/+treyratcliff/posts/da1wjfvrlxq ) , and he 's perfectly happy for people to use his photos for personal use : he puts all his photos out in full resolution , sans watermark . 
  so what if he wants one * small * plug for his blog ? 
  there are almost certainly going to be people who see this photo and think `` wow , i want to see more photos like this ! '' . 
  he 's given those people a way to get what they want . 
  usually reddit complains about a * lack * of source . 
  i do n't care if this gets downvoted just like trey 's comments . 
  i think reddit is being absolutely despicable in this thread , and needs to be called out for it . 
  hey trey , long time follower on your other social media outlets . 
  i actually clicked on the link without seeing the username of who submitted it , and did a double-take when i realised it was you . 
  just want to say thanks for sharing the awesome photos , and sorry that reddit 's being such an arsehat about it . 
  honestly , i 'm embarrassed to call myself a redditor at the moment . 
  i ca n't say for certain , but i imagine the pictures not loading was due to heavy traffic to his website .
