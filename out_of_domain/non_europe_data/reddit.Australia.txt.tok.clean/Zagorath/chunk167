  it 's working fine for me now . 
  yo dude , that is * not * a popular opinion around here . 
  but it definitely one that i agree with ( apart from the mobile phone camera feature stuff ) . 
  people hate on win8 because it 's different , and they hate change . 
  it 's a clear move towards the future , and i commend microsoft for making such a bold move , and pulling it off as well as they did . 
  regarding the site , try it again now . 
  i think it may have been not working before because too many people were going there at once . 
  everything 's loading fine for me now . 
  and the ads are hardly in the way at all . 
  i know , right !? 
  people are complaining about this guy like he 's some joe-blow spamming reddit just to get viewers to his site . 
  he 's got a fucking huge following . 
  he shares his photos because he loves photography . 
  the way people are acting in this thread is despicable . 
  have you got the latest software version ? 
  i found that my battery was absolutely horrible when i first got it , but when i upgraded to 4.2.2 it 's a lot better , and can easily get a full day if i 'm not ingressing . 
  alternatively , if you 're at work , why would n't you just leave it plugged in ? 
  no word ( as far as i can tell ) on the tech specs of the sound , all it says is `` high-quality sound '' . 
  flat cable , which is really nice , should reduce tangling . 
  edit : they 've also got spare cables and adaptors available now . 
  still waiting for the charging orb internationally .

  nope . 
  in fact , they imply on the product page it should work :, 
   device with 3.5 mm headset jack , such as nexus 4, 
  key word , * such as * . 
  ouch . 
  where are you ? 
  i do n't know about using apple mics on android , but mics designed for an android device work just fine on ios . 
  based on [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/1bltfo/new_nexus_4_accessories_arrive_on_google_play/ ) , people seem to think that they will have a single play/pause/answer button , but not separate volume buttons . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm thinking . 
  gon na wait until a ) i can get reviews to know the sound is n't absolutely awful , and b ) the bumper case is back in stock so i can buy them both together ( and hopefully save on shipping costs , not actually sure how that works ), 
  that 's an absolutely amazing link , but unfortunately is far too complex for me . 
  i have n't got a clue how to interpret it . 
  all i 'm looking for is the frequency response , written as a single range of hz ( maybe a second frequency response for the mic , but that 's not so important ) , and the sensitivity in db . 
  also , it 's only speculation that it is the same set . 
  it really should n't be that hard for google to put up a proper tech specs sheet of their own . 
  like [ this ] ( http://sennheiser.com.au/au/home_en.nsf/root/private_headsets_mobile_music_504582 ) or [ this ] ( http://www.jays.se/products/a-jays-one-plus ) ( just the first two brands that came to mind ) . 
  honest question , * can * she be tried in other lands ? 
  would n't she have diplomatic immunity ? 
  another point for discussion , if you are correct that she can be tried in other lands , does this include commonwealth realms such as australia and canada ? 
  actually , this bill has not yet received royal assent . 
  says so right in the lead . 
  just out of curiosity , what 's the reason for only people over 19 ? 
  from my logic , anything you can legally do at 19 , you can also legally do at 18 . 
  it 's only at 21 that things change ( and even then , only in the us , not really many other places ) . 
  shame they have n't got a standard ... 
  i ca n't speak for canada , but in aus the queen is still our legal head of state and the place that our parliament gets its power from . 
  hate to tell you this , but hyperbole is a literary device . 
  you 're looking for hyperbola . 
  this works better if you say it :, 
   ah the classic `` bring up points completely irrelevant to the topic at hand to attack the person because you do n't have a good argument '' argument, 
  just came back to this . 
  i did n't realise you were being an arse just like the rest of this thread ... 
  my bad . 
  if you actually followed the guy you 'd know that he * is * actually really humble . 
  citing the fact that his website is the number 1 for travel photography is n't not being humble , it 's just citing a fact . 
  as others have said , battery drain is my main reason . 
  i * never * have bluetooth turned on on my phone , because i never use it , and why would i want the battery drain that comes with it ? 
  there 's also the issue of having to keep the headphones themselves charged , which is a pain . 
  then there 's also the ability to quickly unplug them and plug them into another device or computer , which is problematic at best in bluetooth devices . 
  sorry about the downvotes , mate . 
  you actually helped a heap . 
  i did n't even know / r/nexus4 existed , and the thread they had about this same news was really educational . 
  i 'm guessing the downvotes are because you came across as though you were `` pointing '' me there and implying that this news should be placed there and not here , which is certainly not the way i chose to interpret it . 
  if you actually * had * checked the op , you 'd see he 's far from wanting visitors . 
  he 's an incredibly popular and successful photographer , and the photos in this particular post are * far * from his best work . 
  iirc , he started photography quite late ( i.e. , not as a kid/teenager , but as an adult ) , so this may be amongst his earliest work . 
  even if not , it 's a world away from what he does today ( the blog post was written in 2007 ) . 
  he 's got over 4 million followers on g + , and i do n't know how many he 's had now , but at the end of 2010 his photos online had garnered over 50 million views . 
  he 's also got a very [ reddit-friendly stance on copyright ] ( https://plus.google.com/u/0/+treyratcliff/posts/da1wjfvrlxq ) : giving out full sized , watermark-free photos that he 's perfectly happy for people to use for personal use . 
  he * did n't * link to his blog in every picture . 
  he linked it on the first picture only . 
  and tbh , i do n't think these photos are very good at all . 
  filters or not . 
  however , i happen to * love * a lot of trey 's other work . 
  i think this is some of his earlier work ( blog post dated 2007 ) , so it 's not as good as most of his more recent stuff . 
  nobody seems to have answered your question fully . 
  the reason he has photos from all over the place each day is because he does n't post immediately . 
  whenever he goes somewhere , he takes a heap of photos , and he posts one photo a day from anywhere in his backlog . 
  he was born in ' 16 . 
  i have to charge my phone every night , and having to charge yet another thing is a pain . 
  my main point was n't about charging the headset itself , though , but how it would drain the battery of my phone by requiring an active bluetooth connection . 
  my phone often barely makes it through the day as is . 
  besides that , i honestly do n't see how bluetooth is that much of an advantage . 
  i do n't find the cord to be annoying at all . 
  and finally , as i said , i frequently switch between devices , and doing that over bluetooth is nowhere near as easy as unplugging and plugging back in a cable . 
  ah , good old [ muphry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muphry%27s_law ) . 
  and , since this particular discussion thread does seem civil , i would encourage you to look at the situation in countries with stricter gun control . 
  remember that `` gun control '' does n't * have * to mean banning guns . 
  for example , i believe ( i could be wrong about the exact country , but i 'm fairly confident somewhere has this law ) in switzerland all adult men are * required * to have a gun , but it must be kept stored securely , and separate from its ammo . 
  this is a form of gun control . 
  and yet you never hear about gun violence in switzerland , or indeed in any other european countries . 
  you get the occasional large-scale attack like in norway a few years back , but even those are less common than in the us . 
  more importantly , smaller-scale gun violence , and gun-related accidents are far less common . 
  other countries very worth looking into are the united kingdom and australia . 
  i 'm assuming that you mean fines given for not wearing a seatbelt :,
