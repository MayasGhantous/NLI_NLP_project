  ca n't help with number 1 though , sorry . 
  i actually happen to quite like ( quite , meaning more than zero but much less than a lot ) the newsfeed ( g + does it better , though ) , and do n't mind the promotions too much . 
  i 've actually found quite a few things that * were * relevant to me as promoted posts . 
  i 've heard this many times , and while i trust it , i 've also never seen reliable data to back it up . 
  ( which is a rather long-winded way to say , i would actually be interested in seeing the data . ), 
  however , i 'm far more interested in homicides and accidental deaths than i am in non-fatal crimes . 
  i 'd much rather be assaulted than murdered , though obviously neither is desirable . 
  to be entirely honest , when i initially presented this fact , i was doing for purely informative purposes . 
  it 's when the pro-gun americans started responding about its inaccuracies that i started debating them . 
  oh , i totally see your side of the argument , but my opinion is that a ) the ads are always clearly marked as such , and b ) it 's a free service that needs to make a profit somehow . 
  as long as the ads continue to be kept to a reasonable level ( i.e. , not so many it 's hard to sort through actual friend 's content ) , and are always clearly distinguishable from normal friend 's content ( they could do better on this , a coloured background would be nice , but having text like `` sponsored post '' is acceptable to me ) , then i 'm relatively happy . 
  finally , they need to continue being relevant . 
  at the moment , the vast majority of the sponsored posts i see actually are things i 'm interested in , so it does n't bother me . 
  if they started advertising things i do n't care about ( like most of the stuff in the ads at the side ) , that 's when i get angry . 
  i understand why people disagree with this point of view , and certainly i would * prefer * a cleaner experience like that on g + , but it does n't especially bother me either . 
  except you 've just stated as a fact something that is blatantly not true . 
  canada has nearly 1/3 the amount of guns per capita of the united states . 
  ( 30.8 per 100 people compared to 88.8 for the us ) . 
  and you 've literally just used yemen as an example in a post where you reply to how i 've pointed out comparing different cultures and income levels is impossible . 
  i do n't know about britain , because i 'm not british . 
  i do n't know why the fuck you 're assuming i am british , i never said nor implied that was the case . 
  but in australia , yes , pepper spray is illegal ( except in western australia ) . 
  anything that would be possessed with the intention of using it as a weapon is illegal . 
  and if you really feel this conversation was a waste of time , then i 'm very sorry for you . 
  an intellectual discussion of opposing viewpoints is not something that one should consider a waste of time . 
  by the way , if you really do hope i `` get slapped around by some yobs one day '' , then fuck you , you are a complete and utter arsehole . 
  i assume , though , that you are only saying it for dramatic effect , in which case that 's just being slightly immature . 
  but seriously , wishing that sort of thing on * anyone * who is n't utterly evil ( e.g. 
  hitler ) is utterly horrid and truly makes you an arse . 
  edit : by the way , for ** fucks sake ** guys , could you not maybe ** try ** to follow reddiquette . 
  this has been ( for the most part ) a civil debate of opposing viewpoints that was relevant to the discussion at hand . 
  ** you are n't supposed to downvote for that ** . 
  huh , i never knew . 
  thanks !, 
  i used firefox from about 2007 until a year or so after the initial release of chrome , and i had never seen this feature . 
  heck , i 've never heard of the location bar . 
  is that their name for the address bar or the search bar ? 
  or was it a separate bar you had to tell it to add in . 
  in either case , firefox had it first , but clearly chrome did it better , and made it * far * more discoverable . 
  utc-5 is roughly east coast america , right ? 
  i guess that means all these people who do n't know about them ( i 'm east coast australia , and had also never heard of them before ) , may not be only because of time zone , but possibly also due to lack of exposure in general . 
  basing this off of the fact that you and some canadians further down did n't know about it , despite it being perfectly suited to your time zone . 
  oh door fuck 's sake . 
  why not try reading through the contents first . 
  or better read , read the content you 're replying to . 
  these statistics have ** already taken population into account ** that 's what per capita * means * . 
  i thought the l in asl was for location . 
  is n't esperanto a language ? 
  on imgur you can change the extension in the url and it does n't make any difference . 
  to be totally honest , i do n't agree with what i said there either . 
  i was , in this instance , referring specifically to userbase , however in a more general sense i agree , opera is most definitely one of the major browsers . 
  very true . 
  i would argue that the most relevant statistic to compare , then , is the total homicide rate , for all types of homicide . 
  the reason for this is that while violent crimes may still happen , my argument is that more guns results in a greater number of these being fatal . 
  if you look at the total homicide rates , you see a similar trend to the total gun-related deaths , although the difference in this case is less extreme . 
  us : 4.8 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants . 
  i 'd hardly call that an `` essay '' . 
  it 's some guy 's blog ( which by itself is n't necessarily a problem ) , and does n't have any references ( there 's the problem ) . 
  an argument can be made for other forms of self defense being legal , particularly ones like pepper spray that have a very low chance of being lethal . 
  however , the argument against guns is much more solid , because they can immediately escalate what would otherwise have been a relatively small issue into someone 's death . 
  the fact that a gun could have protected * you * does n't mean it 's a good idea for you to have one if it increases the possibility of you killing someone else . 
  recently in brisbane , a man with a gun was running around a major central area of the city . 
  had this happened in america , you can almost guarantee that some bystander with a gun would have shot him down , and quite likely killed him , or even worse : hit another bystander , and started the original gunman shooting . 
  however , because the people around him did n't have a gun , he actually never fired a shot , and police were able to come in and apprehend him safely . 
  no one was shot ( except with rubber bullets , which the police used to apprehend the gunman ) , no one was killed . 
  this was only possible because people were not carrying guns on them . 
  guns in the uk were banned around 1997 . 
  i ca n't find reliable statistics , but [ this article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9411649/graphic-how-the-murder-rate-has-fallen.html ) seems to show that the number of homicides increased until about 2003 , after which point it has consistently fallen . 
  this delay in reaction can be attributed to difficulties in regulating the gun ban initially . 
  it 's worth noting , too , that this is showing gross gun homicides , not a per capita rate , and thus at least some of the increase will have been due to an increase in population , making the decrease since 2003 even more significant . 
  and i ca n't speak for my scottish friend here , but all other crimes * do n't * matter to me in this debate . 
  the entire * point * is that more guns results in more deaths , whether that be a criminal murdering somebody , or the criminal being killed in self-defence ( which is n't included in `` homicide '' rates anyway ) . 
  in the argument that i am making , violent crimes as a whole are not relevant . 
  my very argument is that more guns results in a higher number of crimes that result in death . 
  that includes homicides as a total number ( both those using guns and those not ) , as well as cases where the attacker is killed in self defence , which should not happen , and does not happen in places where guns are outlawed . 
  worth noting , though , if you look through this thread , none of the statistics are including this part of the argument . 
  saying it has been disproved does n't mean it has . 
  the data i 'm looking at shows a higher rate of homicide in the us than in canada , which is higher than the uk and australia . 
  the us also has more guns per capita than canada , which has more than the uk and australia . 
  yeah , reddit can be finnicky . 
  but congrats on being [ one of today 's 10,000 ] ( http://xkcd.com/1053/ ) !, 
  except soccer players . 
  seconded , i can never remember collins , but i feel like aldrin is known by pretty much everyone with even a slight interest in the matter . 
  ( also not us . ), 
  you associate a voice style with the name . 
  i 'm more confused about why the character 's name would be different . 
  unless aldrin and armstrong were chosen as a pair , and a different choice instead of armstrong would have resulted in aldrin not going ( i honestly do n't know if this would be the case , though i suspect not ) , we 'd still have someone named buzz on the mission , so buzz lightyear still makes sense as a character name . 
  right , but it almost certainly would n't be the same one armstrong used . 
  it would have , for one thing , probably not created the debate about what it was he actually said , and whether the `` a '' was there or not . 
  `` one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind '', 
  butterfly effect is a bloody awesome film !, 
  the ending was absolutely amazing ( make sure you see the dvd version , completely different ending , and imo much more poignant ) . 
  $ 1.5 billion . 
  the 1 billion number is # 1 billion . 
  agreed wholeheartedly . 
  just reading this has put a massive smile on my face . 
  the problem is that there * are * some people who self-identify as feminists who do react in that way . 
  and they blacken the name of feminists in general , however unfair that may be . 
  there are arseholes in any group , and we really should try to see past them and look at the average person . 
  that can be difficult to do , sometimes , though , unfortunately , because the arseholes are the ones that are out front showing themselves to the public the most .
