  where abouts ? 
  that 15 is the year of her birth . 
  not to mention he 's professor x from x-men . 
  haha yeah , he 's been in a heap of amazing things . 
  i considered mentioning the extras skit , as well as the david tennant hamlet , but i figured those are n't nearly as big as x-men and trek . 
  oh right . 
  must be a different victoria . 
  i was thinking of the australian state ... 
  probably could just alter the second question to be :, 
  do you own a gun ? 
  * no , and have no interest, 
  * no , but previously did [ i 'm adding this one as another possible option ], 
  * no , but i am considering it / intend to [ your answer ], 
  * yes, 
  wow , that really was quick . 
  hope to see the results shared soon . 
  pregnancy ? 
  was that included just as a check that people are n't answering randomly , or is there some way that that can be legitimately interpreted as being less than fully feminine ? 
  anyway , really cool survey . 
  i hope you can share the results here on reddit . 
  i found it quite interesting that it does n't ask for the participants gender . 
  best of luck !, 
  regarding the nbn , there was some brilliant information in / r/australia about this a few days ago : [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1bz4zt/nah_we_dont_need_to_upgrade_australias_fixedline/c9biw2m?context=2 ) . 
  to be honest , your stance on this issue seems very similar to that of the relatives that i mentioned in my comment there . 
  it does say a `` 100-meter dash '' . 
  assuming that means he 's trying to talk about the standard 100m sprint event , it would have to be straight . 
  i have n't seen any other productions of hamlet ( either staged or film ) , but we were told to watch this one in english class when we studied the play , and it 's absolutely awesome !, 
  enjoy your evening !, 
  you say you ca n't pick the lesser of two evils , but your previous comment says `` you should be able to see though that abbott will be worse for australia '' , which makes it seem fairly clear to me that you are of the opinion that labor would be the lesser of two evils . 
  or am i reading that wrong ? 
  i think this is perhaps the best analysis of star wars i 've seen yet . 
  i 've never understood the hate for the prequel trilogy , but i think perhaps that 's because i 'm thinking more of what it * could have been * than what it really was . . 
  i absolutely love the idea of that development , but it really was n't pulled off as well as it should have been . 
  ( though i 'm still not sure i 'd go as far as you do in criticising them . ), 
  this made me laugh . 
  and then it made me sad at how true it is :(, 
  i believe it 's [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif/comments/iqfog/what_if_leon_trotski_had_replaced_lenin_and_not/ ) . 
  quick-edit : wait , no , more likely [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif/comments/183axv/what_if_stalin_never_came_to_power_in_the_ussr/ ) , since he said `` recently '' . 
  edit again : hmm , both of those seem to have had very few answers , but the second link in particular only had one user providing content . 
  perhaps neither of those is the correct one , but i 'd say if one of them is correct , it 's most likely the first link i provided . 
  you can use a site : search on google ( `` site : [ siteurl ] [ keywords ] '' ) . 
  for example `` site : reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif lenin stalin '' comes up with [ these ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif/comments/iqfog/what_if_leon_trotski_had_replaced_lenin_and_not/ ) [ two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif/comments/183axv/what_if_stalin_never_came_to_power_in_the_ussr/ ) links from a year ago and two months ago , respectively . 
  no he was n't . 
  he repeated a story he had heard , and when he found out it was false , he apologised very eloquently . 
  one experiment is n't necessarily statistically insignificant , it 's the number of data points within that experiment . 
  this experiment had 1 data point , which is what makes it insignificant scientifically . 
  is / u/theproject really the creator of do n't shoot the pianist ? 
  looking through their reddit submission history , i do n't see anything other than the april fools ' day joke submitted by them ... 
   the rest of the audience , apparently , were placed in a position where they could not even recognise a single note , played unaccompanied , by a standard instrument of the symphony orchestra, 
  that note is well outside of the bassoon 's normal playing range , especially at the time . 
  still , this was a great read . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  hahaha awesome !, 
  now have you res tagged so i do n't make the mistake again . 
  holy fuck . 
  i only learnt about baader-meinhof a few weeks ago and now it 's * everywhere * . 
  huh ... 
  i ( an aussie ) pronounce both words exactly the same . 
  on my phone so ca n't give you the ipa representation , but it would be something like ahse or arse . 
  are they not pronounced the same ? 
  i 've always pronounced then both like `` arse '' . 
  a quick survey of the room and everyone here 's the same . 
  yep . 
  to me they would all be pronounced identically . 
  or are corrupt student unions just commonplace ? 
  beethoven 's my favourite composer hands down , and his symphony no. 5 is my favourite piece , although it 's a tough pick between that and a * heap * of others ( both by beethoven and other composers ) . 
  sure the first movement is famous and way over-played , but it 's just such an amazing composition . 
  i really feel as though it 's one of the most precise pieces ever written . 
  every note is so precise and perfectly written from the famous opening notes to the end of that rousing finale . 
  i nearly got to conduct my school 's orchestra in playing the first movement of it , but unfortunately it was n't ready in time for the performance . 
  mahler 's 1st ( particularly the 3rd movement ) is what first really introduced me to mahler . 
  awesome symphony !, 
  i 've never been a fan of orchestral transcriptions of satie . 
  to me , they completely defeat the purpose of the minimal style of satie 's music . 
  but i absolutely love les gnossiennes . 
  my favourite is no . 
  you confuse me . 
  your username \u2260 your flair \u2260 ( does not * entirely * equal ) this comment . 
  [ memories ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnb2yiiquj4 ) , from dark cloud . 
  in fact , dark cloud has some amazing music . 
  [ reminiscence ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayamcw7fr_u ) , [ broken promise ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkrj9hkvmy ) , and [ the land of hope ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk92gqmtsbi ) are also great . 
  it 's not a very well known game , but it 's got an amazing story , and a great soundtrack to match . 
  tritter specifically said `` skyrim theme '' . 
  the theme itself is , indeed , as stonedchao said , the elder scrolls theme . 
  it just gets used differently in each of the games to create very different pieces . 
  when i was playing test of time , the first time i destroyed an enemy and it played the funeral march ( i ca n't remember , either chopin 's famous one , or the second movement of beethoven 's 3rd symphony ) , i got so upset i just could n't do it again ... 
  nope what ? 
  nope not uq , in which case it must be yes to them being commonplace , or vice versa ? 
  you * could n't * give a shit about that stuff . 
  if you could give a shit , that would mean you currently have shits to give , and it 's unspecified whether you have only a tiny amount or heaps of shits . 
  but if you could n't give a shit , then you obviously do n't care at all . 
  [ * could n't * care less ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7o0mfkmpw ), 
  what exactly did you want it to do ? 
  \\* have asterisks around it like this \\* ? 
  i 'd just like to point out that many applications on os x have that same problem of putting files everywhere . 
  not all of them , and certainly not the little sorts of apps you 'd get from the app store , but larger , more complicated , ones do . 
  conversely , the fact that closing the last window does n't close the whole program is something i 'd see as an advantage in some applications , and a disadvantage in others . 
  for the most part , it seems to me that programs use this correctly . 
  if i close the aperture window , it closes the entire program , since you only work with a single window in aperture and by closing it i have said that i no longer wish to work on my photos . 
  however , closing a word document is another story .
