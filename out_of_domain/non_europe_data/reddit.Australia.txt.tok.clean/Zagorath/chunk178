  or more precisely , that they * are * secure , but just not in that way . 
  why were `` expressing emotion '' and `` gesturing '' grouped together ? 
  unless gesturing means something very different to you , those two are completely different . 
  side note , the photos are really , * really * noisy . 
  i do n't know if that was part of your plan , but unless you specifically chose it that way , these photos needed a heap more light when they were being taken ( and/or a better camera ) . 
  i feel it was a bad idea planning it during the hours many people are at uni . 
  i ca n't go , and i bet there are a heap of other people who ca n't go , but would want to , too . 
  do you mean the new omnibox , or you just hate the omnibox in general ? 
  will this change any behaviour from before the update ? 
  side note : i 'm on beta , chrome tells me i 'm on the latest version , and i do n't have anything different . 
  same here . 
  menu -  about google chrome definitely says, 
   version 27.0.1453.56 beta, 
  google chrome is up to date . 
  a few ( northern hemisphere ) summers ago i was in austria , around klagenfurt , for the k\u00e4rnten ironman . 
  drove past mahler 's composing hut daily few a week , but never got the chance to actually go up to it . 
  can we get australia now ? 
  preferential is great , but optional preferential is better . 
  at the moment , to vote below the line , it takes dozens of numbers . 
  if preferencing was optional , i could number off my preferred parties , ending with my preferred major party ( lnp or alp ) , and stop there , likely not more than a few numbers . 
  you are awesome !, 
  i believe they 're [ trying to make a comeback ] ( http://www.australiandemocrats.org.au/ ) , if you 're interested . 
  i 'd say you usually want to round up when they make this kind of mistake , as though the groups are all, 
  x to y, 
  x < = age < y, 
  * but * in a derogatory way ? 
  no offense meant to americans , but in western countries outside of america , i 've always gotten the impression that being called an american is * always * meant in a derogatory way . 
  but more density with the same mass , which means a smaller radius , means you can get closer without physically contacting . 
  my problem with them compared to other nominally one-issue parties ( in particular the greens ) is that they actually * are * one-issue . 
  their stances on other issues far too often seem to drift back to sex . 
  how is it that only one of their workplace relations points is * not * about sex workers ? 
  and even that one point could arguably be linked tangentially to sex ( in that it is about parental leave ) . 
  i agree with many of their positions , but i feel they need to grow to have good policies that cover far more areas . 
  what 's their stance on the nbn ? 
  the carbon tax/ets ? 
  taxation in general ? 
   the majority of taiwanese citizens do n't actually want this, 
  none of the taiwanese i 've known ( a fair few ) would agree with you here . 
  there are a few factions within taiwan . 
  one would like reunification with china , under mainland rule ( very , very small portion of the population , to my knowledge ) . 
  another would like reunification under taiwanese rule , or recognition of the republic of china as `` china '' . 
  the third faction , and the one that all the people i 've known are in , is to have taiwan recognised as its own nation , along side the people 's republic of china . 
  granted , the ones i 've known have been living overseas , so that may bias the results slightly . 
  edit :  voting for someone and banking on them being unable to do what they said they would seems like a very risky proposition to me, 
  i 'm not sure i 'd use the term risky , but i agree it 's not something i would ever do or recommend others do , either . 
  like the interrobang, 
   sounds mostly correct , but to be honest labor have shifted pretty far to the right themselves . 
  gillard fucked over rudds geunine progressive ambitions and labor 's position on asylum seekers is just as disgusting as the liberal party . 
  i was with you for that much of it ( and in fact fully agreed with you ) . 
  and then you went full retard . 
  he neither said nor implied that he was a member or associated with labor , and even if he was , there was no call for an ad hominem . 
  yeah , and you get smaller , meaning you can get in closer , meaning your centre of gravity is closer . 
  please explain how this does n't make sense . 
  this guy , [ or a few other possible candidates ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szjdcpbjar4 ), 
  do you walk slowly or something ? 
  it takes me 10 minutes to get across from ih to the uq centre , pretty much the opposite side of the uni . 
  i would also like to know this . 
  i 'm on vaya , another optus reseller , who used to offer ridiculously cheap plans . 
  they 've since moved to 4g plans which are no where near as appealing , but luckily they have a policy to honour a plan for 24 months from sign up , even if the user goes month-to-month . 
  it boggles my mind that vaya , and other companies like amaysim ( optus ) and kogan ( telstra ) can be * so damn cheap !, 
  * when telstra and optus are such massive rip-offs . 
  edit : i can explain why the prices would be at least somewhat cheaper , though . 
  they do n't just buy a plan like you would , and then give that plan to you . 
  they buy the plans in kind of a wholesale manner , and distribute that way ( also , the ones on telstra 's network have a nerfed version of 3g , not the latest dual-band etc. 
  `` nextg '' stuff ) . 
  they also have lower labour costs , due to usually smaller support teams etc. 
  it still does n't seem to me as though it should add up , but i guess the prices they get in that wholesale deal must be ridiculously cheap . 
  i do n't really understand why , though ... 
  not true . 
  at least not in queensland . 
  the only rule is that it be at least 14.6 by 14.6 , and be a red p on a white background . 
  there does n't seem to be a good single source for it , but :, 
  the plate says queensland , so i 'm assuming that 's where they are . 
  the law here is that you must [ ensure that the printed template meets the ** minimum ** size requirements of 14.6 cm x 14.6 cm, 
  prior to use ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/~/media/licensing/gettingalicence/car/provisional%20licence/displaying%20p%20plates/pdf_red_p_plate_template_jun_09.pdf ) [ emphasis mine ] . 
  question regarding that image . 
  why is the us in yellow , and madagascar in a light green ? 
  are they only partial signatories or something ? 
  ( the struckouttedness may not be displaying on mobile devices . ), 
  my god scrumptious . 
  you are bloody amazing !, 
  it seems as though every single thread , here you are with some amazing , incredibly detailed , insight into the topic at hand . 
  no matter what the topic is , you 're on to it . 
  i had never even * heard * of xenakis before , so i googled and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szazyfchlri ) is what came up . 
  i listened to it , and quite enjoyed it . 
  i then listened to mycenae alpha , at your suggestion , and at first i hated it , but it did n't take too long for me to start quite liking it . 
  6 minutes in now , and i do n't feel as though i have to stop . 
  i think i could only take so much of it at a time , but in small doses ( < 20 min a go ) i think i can quite enjoy it . 
  keep being awesome . 
  i thought it was quite clear that i * do n't * fully know all about the differences between telstra 's standard network and the one they resell by the way i worded it . 
  that was my intention . 
  i merely wanted it made clear that the connection * is n't * as good as the one standard telstra customers get . 
  ( whereas optus resellers * do * get the same network . ), 
  however , i do understand enough of it to know that a lot of what you 're going on about is bullshit . 
  optus 's network is absolutely fine in the cities , where its 3g coverage is a nonissue , and speeds are comparable to telstra 's . 
  i would think that saying you `` get what you pay for '' is absolutely wrong . 
  the performance on vaya , amaysim , and other optus resellers is exactly equal to that of optus 's 3g or 4g networks ( depending on your specific plan ) , and that 's damn good . 
  you also pay a fraction of the cost of going through optus ( and also get * better * customer service , in my experience ) . 
  one of them is n't on a proportional relation of `` get what you pay for '' . 
  either optus rips everyone off and you get less than you 're paying for , or the resellers are ridiculously cheap and you 're getting way more than you 're paying for .
