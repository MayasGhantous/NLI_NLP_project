  telstra 's greater coverage is incredibly important for some people , and those people should go with telstra . 
  however , for me , it 's not important , as i rarely , if ever , go outside of populous areas to need that sort of coverage . 
  many , many people are in the same boat as me in this respect , and these people are also perfectly fine going with optus or a reseller of its network . 
  p.s. , do n't pretend * you * know what * you 're * on about , using terms like `` the good phone wifi 's '' . 
  a ) wifi is the term for wireless lan connections , not the telco 's networks b ) wifi is uncountable , does n't need an s to be made plural . 
  even if it did , it would n't have an apostrophe . 
  ( you have the same problem when you write `` companie 's '' ) c ) even correcting those problems , what the hell is `` the good phone wireless data '' supposed to mean ? 
  it sounds like someone saying to `` go and use the google '' . 
  p.p.s. , do n't bring ad hominems into this . 
  it 's unbecoming . 
  you 're just ignoring my words . 
  your 4m circle can now move so that its centre of gravity is now one metre closer than it was before , because there 's now empty space where before the two objects were touching . 
  it can move to fill that space , and thus the centre of gravities of the two objects are closer together . 
  why is everyone having a hard time understanding this . 
  imagine two fat people ( sumo wrestlers ) and two really skinny people . 
  just pretend for a moment that despite the enormous size difference , they weigh the same . 
  put the fat ones together so their bellies touch . 
  do the same with the skinny people . 
  which ones will have closer centre of gravities ? 
  americans have far more say over this sort of thing than most democracies , particularly westminster systems where unfortunately the party line is sacrosanct . 
  for you to change something , you and a number of other people need to contact your local representative and convince him he will be voted out if he votes for it . 
  here in australia , members will ** always ** vote the way the party leader tells them to . 
  the only way to change the way one of them votes is to convince the entire party , which is far more difficult . 
   and failing dismally because this is something that really only effects the sikh community ( in a positive way ) . 
  you did n't actually read the thread , did you ? 
  if you had , you 'd realise that most of the arguments are making the logical statement that if someone without a helmet injures their head , everyone will be paying for it in their taxes . 
  this means it will affect everyone else , regardless of how ( or even if ) they choose to ride their bikes . 
  yes it did :, 
   means you can get closer without physically contacting, 
  the bit you quoted , i was referring to the radius of the `` object '' itself , not the radius of the distance between them . 
  i can see how that would be confusing , though . 
   i will strive to be more becoming, 
  take an upvote just because this made me laugh . 
  yeah they have the widest coverage on both their upgraded 3g and their true 4g networks , but the 4g does n't bother me at all , my phone ( nexus 4 ) does n't have 4g , and most places i go have 3g coverage on optus anyway . 
  there would be literally no advantage * for me personally * in going to telstra . 
  that i also happen to believe telstra 's prices are a rip-off even for people who would consider them is n't particularly relevant here . 
  perhaps their better network means that they are a better deal than optus itself , on account of both having very expensive prices , but i still believe the smaller resellers offer a far better option for most people . 
  but again , that 's not particularly relevant to the conversation at hand . 
  you 're trying to change the issue at hand . 
  we 're not talking about fat people , we 're talking about riding bikes without helmets . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the law should apply to everyone , or no one . 
  i 'm happy with everyone being required to wear a helmet , but i also would n't campaign against ( or for ) any move to have that law removed . 
  what i * am * against is that some people can be allowed an exception because of their religion . 
  it 's discrimination , pure and simple . 
  that it happens to be discrimination * in favour * of a minority does n't change that . 
  the tax thing links into this because some people would argue strongly against removing the law entirely because that would have tax implications . 
  they ca n't do speed limiters because there 's always going to be emergencies where going faster than the speed limit is necessary . 
  i do n't meen `` oh no , i 'm going to be late for a meeting '' emergencies , but life threatening ones , like if another car is driving unsafely and about to hit you or something . 
  thanks for this !, 
  i assumed that they were a motorcycle gang ( the picture sure makes them look like that ) , and this was an example of criminals doing something good because fuck those evil wbc guys . 
  that incorrect assumption lead me to a completely conclusion in my mind to the real one . 
  it 's the same in australia , and the same in europe ( with slightly stricter laws when it comes to anything nazi-related ) . 
  honestly , this is the correct way to do freedom of speech . 
  allowing anything goes with no exceptions is just stupid , and i really get sick of americans like / u/zgish claiming it 's not a freedom if it has these restrictions in place . 
  just off-topic , the word is copyright , not copywrite , and so it would be copyrighted material , not copywritten . 
  but i agree completely , this na\u00efve attitude that all speech , including that of the wbc , should be protected , is one of the things that really annoys me about americans . 
  there are restrictions on it , and there ** should be ** restrictions on it , in order to protect others . 
  your rights end where they infringe on another 's . 
  the problem is it is n't just about inciting violence . 
  in any other country , what the wbc does would very clearly be defined as harassment , and would therefore not be allowed . 
  your rights end when they infringe on another 's . 
   by the way , i did n't downvote you, 
  you would have had the right to do so , though . 
  falmarri was n't contributing to the discussion at all . 
  ( s ) he did n't make any attempt to provide an explanation for * why * your teacher taught you was wrong . 
  it 's perfectly within rediquette to downvote . 
  it seems fairly obvious to me . 
  if the people attending the funeral know you 're there spreading your hateful message , that 's harassment . 
  if you do it such that they do n't know it 's going on , it 's not . 
  that 's just one case , though , other examples would obviously work differently . 
  i 've heard something similar . 
  not to * hear * mussorgsky 's original , but to * play * it . 
  hearing it , to be brutally honest , is dull , to me . 
  but i can really imagine the emotion that must be behind playing it yourself . 
  but i absolutely love this orchestration of it , it 's an absolute masterpiece . 
  and regarding a book on orchestration , i would [ strongly disagree ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8po7fzonp-i ) that this is as close as he came . 
  [ not available outside the us ], 
  but joe just said * one of which * has been win-traded . 
  one switches , and resets to level 1 , but the other would presumably stay at the same level , having been unfairly levelled up . 
  perhaps that person should change name ( which i believe also resets you ) . 
  note people : it 's also not meant to be used when the person is wrong . 
  / u/whitewing1984 clearly * is * wrong : fully charging portals is the largest ap increase in the game . 
  this still does n't mean to downvote him . 
  whoa ... i always figured the ingress launch video was actually made by google themselves . 
  you did an awesome job . 
  did you get it in spain on your spanish device ? 
  i believe it 's like wallet . 
  it 'll work overseas , but you have to be american ( or use workarounds ) to get it . 
  urgh yes . 
  this gets * very * annoying . 
   it 'd be false advertisement not to include that, 
  you just described everywhere in america . 
  i got kicked out of an irc chat room at around age 13 -- 14 for using `` dong '' . 
  i lived in vietnam at the time ( where `` dong '' is the currency ) , and since it 's chiefly an american term ( i 'm australian , and it would be understood here , but not frequently used ) , i could n't understand why it was being censored . 
  it did n't help that the word did n't appear censored to the person typing it in , and also that the mods were douches and did n't actually want to help explain it . 
  til there 's a type of ice cream called turtle ice cream ... 
  i also thought it was pre-madonna , referencing the singer , but did n't think it through enough to realise that were this correct it would mean `` before '' madonna . 
  you 've probably seen from the replies to this : your mistake here is a common one . 
  another one that i see a lot is should/would of . 
  it 's should/would * have * .
