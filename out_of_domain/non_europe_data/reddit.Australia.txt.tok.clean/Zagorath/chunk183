  that 's a bacronym . 
  an acronym that was * made up * to give meaning to something after the fact .

  aaaand now i 'm breathing manually ... 
  to my ( completely amateur ) knowledge , yes , that 's exactly it . 
  please , someone who knows better come along and correct me if i 'm wrong ( and let me know if i got it right/close ) . 
  only when it means celebrating an extra holiday !, 
  source : i know christians who do this . 
   while everybody else was put in concentration camps, 
  lol , did she think hitler put himself in a camp ? 
  this is an important point , and i suspect the latter . 
  looking further into the thread , i found [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1davnx/til_that_during_a_lecture_an_oxford_philosopher/c9olk6s ) which goes into more detail . 
  but that would imply saying something negative with a negative tone gives a positive ( - ) ( - ) = ( + ) . 
  which does n't make sense at all . 
  ( also , hating someone for when they were born is really immature . ), 
  i feel as though that 's the point of the story . 
  it was an amazing feat of teamwork on the part of m\u00fcnchen enlightened . 
  able to get such a huge number of items stored , and then collaborate to have a constant 28 hour run so that bombenm\u00e4dchen could keep going non-stop . 
  it 's an amazing team effort , not an incredibly individual feat .

  a bit slow for my liking , but she does have an amazing voice . 
  can we get a youtube link ? 
  not everyone has spotify , and those that do ca n't necessarily access that link . 
  no , i 'm saying if you said something * negative * with a negative tone . 
  that would , if we go by / u/i _ alsodislikethat 's idea , mean the `` something negative '' which you were saying would be * ( - ) * , and your negative tone of voice would count as * ( - ) * , and thus you end up with ( - ) ( - ) , which mathematically equals ( + ) . 
  many thanks !, 
  unfortunately , australia seems to only get a small selection of spotify 's tracks . 
  not that it bothers me much anyway , i do n't like using it anyway when i can avoid it . 
  i 'd rather i did n't even have an account ... 
  but i agree , that is definitely an amazing piece of music . 
  i ( still ) * really * need to get more into mahler ... 
  this males a nice story , but that 's not how taxes are described . 
  typically we use the terms * progressive * -- where the tax makes up a higher percentage of wealthy people 's income -- or * regressive * -- where poorer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes . 
  for example , income taxes where you pay more in higher income brackets are progressive . 
  taxes on commodities such as cigarettes ate regressive , since richer people are n't likely to buy proportionally more cigarettes then poorer people .

  i definitely think mods should at least have the * option * of hiding the scores permanently . 
  what a useless ad . 
  do advertisers on reddit have the option to display ads based on location ? 
  as someone outside of america , i feel walmart is wasting their money displaying ads to me . 
  question , is the nexus 4 prone to burning ? 
  just want to know so i can make sure to watch out for it . 
  also , is there one particular type of screen that 's susceptible ( e.g. , super amoled ones all have this problem ) , or it is device-specific somehow ? 
  actually , it 's a cute kitten . 
  feel free to go back and click on it , as long as you do n't see an asterisk . 
  the pic 's safe . 
  as long as you do n't see an asterisk next to it by the time you go back to view it , it 's actually a cute kitten . 
  i do n't think i have the stomach to watch it , but could you ( or someone ) answer this for me . 
  are animals that are more free range , such as free range chicken , or grass fed cattle -- as opposed to grain fed , which i hear is more common in the us ( the two may have different answers ) -- subject to the same terrible conditions you 've described ? 
  edit : in australia, 
  everything i 've read puts the 3rd at the start of the romantic era . 
  there are a number of things in the music that give it that role , but far more important ( imo ) is the politics around it . 
  prior to that , it was rare to find the same sort of political influence and ideology that was behind eroica . 
  originally dedicated to napoleon as a herald of the way forward in politics , towards a more democratic society , beethoven destroyed the dedication when napoleon named himself emperor . 
  the general musical consensus is that he 's a borderline figure . 
  his 3rd symphony is usually regarded as the first piece of romantic-era music . 
  i 'm not a musicologist , so i ca n't debate this as strongly as someone learned in the area , but i believe it has as much to do with beethoven 's politics as his musical style . 
  sorry , i should have specified . 
  i 'm in australia . 
  ( thought it was obvious i * was n't * in the us based on my comment , although there was no real indication other than that . ), 
  right over left ( as an ambidextrous with more left-handed tendencies ), 
  i 'm not american , so i wo n't complete this , but i would like to point out a few things :, 
  * you ask for americans , but remember not all americans live in america ( the which state are you in question does n't give an option for these people ) . 
  * many people may regularly use more than one ( for example , i would use `` handle '' to refer to either a door handle or an online handle/username . 
  i know most of them said to `` mark the first definition that comes to mind '' , but sometimes that is n't easy because more than one meaning will spring to mind immediately . 
  * many people may have extra answers that are n't included , for example for me `` dope '' is usually a verb referring to the action of taking drugs to improve sport performance ( or blood doping , which is similar , but does n't involve drugs ) , or `` handle '' would be a verb * feel or manipulate with the hands * . 
  * the carbonated drink question , perhaps this is a word that never gets used in america , but everyone outside of america i 've talked to uses `` soft drink '' . 
  i find it difficult to believe that there is n't at least a portion of the population in america that would use this , too . 
  ok , i know nearly everyone here will know that this is skyrim , but i 'm downvoting on principal because i think we need to get people to start putting the game in the title . 
  not an option [ skyrim ], 
  is your sister insane ? 
  truth teller will say yes . 
  inane one , since she believes the lie , will think the answer is yes , will therefore lie and say no .

  if you own a smartphone running android , the game * ingress * . 
  it 's an awesome augmented reality/location based game that has a strong emphasis on community and teamwork . 
  toy can start out talking with others from your team on the in game chat and on google + , but after a while meeting people irl becomes more common . 
  ah thanks !, 
  i vaguely remembered a cgpgrey about this before , but your comment reminded me if exactly where it was . 
  your best bet is to join the ingress g + community , tell them your location and which faction you 'd like to join , and ask if anyone has an invite for you . 
  it 's complicated , but the short of it is, 
  resistance : fearful of the shapers , believing they are trying to `` control '' humanity . 
  the resistance wants to free humanity from their influence . 
  sometimes described as `` conservative '' . 
  criticised for potentially being the puppets of the secretive nia , the government agency responsible for this whole thing . 
  enlightened : believe the shapers are here to help us . 
  their influence on us -- who they chose because of our innate ability to adapt -- is what allowed humans to advance to the level we 're at today . 
  they helped in such marvels as building the pyramids and going to the moon , and without them human advancement would be far slower . 
  criticised for being pawns of the shapers . 
  also worth getting a look at your local area and seeing who 's in control . 
  if you 're unsure of which ideology you prefer , the game might be more fun on the losing side . 
  alternatively , create some ingress-related artwork and submit that to the g + page , they sometimes give out invites to creative pieces . 
  agreed . 
  i 'm gon na wait till op responds to this before i complete this survey ...
