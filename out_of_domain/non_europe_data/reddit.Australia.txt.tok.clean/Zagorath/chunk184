  well , what is it ? 
  outside the us , i think you 'll find most people * do * know the death penalty is a terrible idea . 
  i 'm not an expert on most of these countries , but let me just say dprk is nowhere * close * to communist . 
  it 's an absolute military dictatorship under the guise of communism . 
  vietnam actually has a very strong economy . 
  there 's immense income inequality , but vietnam 's growth has been second in asia , behind china . 
  it 's also nowhere near communism : more communist than china , perhaps , but still quite capitalist . 
  no , the problem is the lack of an ability for preferences in your voting system . 
  i 'm 100 % opposed to what i see as a ridiculous libertarian ideology , but even i can see that the argument that it would n't work * because states would have their secrets under lock and key * is a poor argument . 
  even secrets on a much smaller scale ( e.g. 
  tech companies ' upcoming products ) ca n't stay secret for long , how on earth would an entire state be able to keep things secret ? 
  there are other reasons that this is a bad idea , but that is n't one of them . 
  you 're right , but what you 've described is a reason that libertarianism is a bad idea , and not a criticism of / u/iam6ft6 's understanding of libertarianism . 
  6ft6 pretty much described libertarianism perfectly . 
  all idealists believe their ideal will be commonplace in the future , but it does n't happen . 
  just like many ideologies before it , libertarianism is an idea that most people can recognise has some value in some of its areas , but is on the whole an absolutely terrible idea . 
  it 's kinda sad that i do n't know this , but do we ( australia ) not have something similar to the us 's safe harbour laws ? 
  they would relinquish you of responsibility for comments , assuming comments are allowed by default . 
  australia, 
  how do you do this , without the `` source '' button showing anything odd . . ? 
  edit : and wtf why does mine do it , too ? 
  tf are you on about with `` not interacting with comments '' ? 
  it 's extremely common to see ops not interact with the comments, 
  this op has left a heap of comments , 2 of which were left before you commented, 
  also , one of ops comments explains the new account . 
  cameras . 
  yes , so much . 
  i 'm left-eye dominant , but all the buttons are on the right . 
  this means when i put my left eye up to the viewfinder , many of the buttons become awkward to adjust . 
  knives is one that bothers me , too . 
  for me , i 've noticed that standard dinner knives tend to be cerated on one side but not the other . 
  when the blade edge points * left * ( as it does when the knife is on the right side of the plate and pointed inwards -- the standard way of setting the table ) , the cerated side is hidden . 
  but when the table is set for a lefty , with the blade pointed * right * ( i.e. , pointing * towards * the plate when the knife is on the left ) , the cerated edge points up . 
  / r/firstworldproblems , but it 's a minor annoyance . 
  measuring cups : this sounds like an improvement :p ( ca n't say i 've noticed ), 
  their childish humour is what turned me off after a while . 
  they were n't so bad ( at least i thought ) at first , and it was really great news content . 
  that 's why i first watched them , and it 's what kept me watching for however long i did ( 9 months , maybe ? ) . 
  but either they got more childish , or i got sick of it , and eventually i gave up . 
  i remember phil saying at one point that sf was n't going in the direction he wanted it to , and i got really excited at that because this was just as i was starting to get bored of it , so i stuck around a while longer hoping it would improve . 
  but it did n't . 
  that 's just my opinion , though . 
  obviously you love it for exactly the reasons i dislike it , so more power to you . 
  how much is too much ? 
  i 'm going to go with [ 73 minutes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq9xduwf4hg ), 
  these are terrible . 
  you should be locked in a cage of glass . 
  my local radio station , [ abc classic fm ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/ ) is awesome !, 
  a great variety of music , from the big beethovens and bachs , to lesser-known ones like ewald and glazunov , as well as jazz time-slots , and featuring local australian composers ' music . 
  best is , it 's available for listening worldwide ( was great when i lived overseas ) . 
  just got ta convert the time to sydney ( utc +10 , or +11 during aussie daylight saving ) time if you want to follow the schedule . 
  i 'm not sure if i understand op 's problem correctly , but if i do :, 
   [ lane lines are usually broken . 
  you can cross broken lines to turn or overtake with caution . 
  however , lane lines are continuous close to ... traffic lights ... you must not cross continuous lane lines .

  this may not be applicable to this post , in which case disregard it ( though if appreciate a clarification ) . 
  otherwise , this shows that what they 're doing * is * indeed illegal . 
  i did mine last year . 
  what did they do that 's different this year ? 
  what . 
  why ?? 
  that makes no sense . 
  normal numbers work just fine , out they could use omr-style sheets if legibility was really that much of an issue ... 
  at my uni , maths at the level of ib hl is required for engineering , so there 's that . 
  ( edit : my current first year maths course has one of the highest fail rates at my uni . 
  around 1/3 of people taking it fail . 
  currently , thanks to hl maths , i 'm finding the course exceptionally easy . ), 
  also the fact that a language is required ( as part of ib -- and i would n't have done one otherwise ) meant that i got bumped up from an op3 based purely on my score , to an op1 after adjusted for the fact that i took a second language ( as well as the maths hl ) . 
  ops are the system used here in queensland schools , and an op1 is the top score . 
  i use tok in everyday life frequently , though it has n't been relevant for my studies . 
  the biggest thing of all , though , is the ee . 
  i 'm already extremely well-versed in researching , writing long-form , and citing sources , far more than most people who went through the normal school system . 
  edit : i 'm also not feeling any stress over workload , though i suspect i would be had i not had ib to prepare me . 
  bullshit is also a skill in lit . 
  in that case omr would be an when better idea . 
  super simple , everyone 's probably used it at least once before , and much less prone to human error than this sounds . 
  i do n't feel like debating that . 
  you have your opinion , i have mine . 
  it 's an issue we 're never going to agree on . 
  but do pray tell , what deranged thinking had you argue for legalising carrying of weapons , either concealed or open , in public ? 
  yeah man , i hate to tell you this , but that 's * really * unsportsmanlike . 
  you really should be ashamed of yourself . 
  it 's just not cricket . 
  ( pun intended ), 
  yeah no fucking kidding . 
  it seems like the league this dude plays on must be exclusively for arseholes or something . 
  it may help us believe you if you could provide the name of the company you work for . 
  if your company really is that large , simply knowing its name should n't be a privacy risk for you personally . 
  if you have 23 people in a room , there 's a 50 % chance that two of them share the same birthday . 
  53 people leads to a 99 % chance . 
  this is known as the [ birthday problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birthday_problem ) , and the reason it 's true , despite intuition , is that you intuitively are trying to compare the chances of anyone sharing a birthday with * you * ( or , more generally , with any one person ) . 
  but it 's not about you , it 's about any two people sharing a birthday . 
  koala `` bears '' are n't bears . 
  ( and calling them koala bears is generally regarded as incorrect . ), 
  the c clarinet certainly is n't that rare . 
  you get it in major works such as beethoven symphonies ( and almost certainly others , but i ca n't think of which off the top of my head ) . 
  also that 's really cool that you 've played a g clarinet . 
  do you feel that the awkwardness may have been at least somewhat related to it being made of metal ? 
   please rank the importance of the following qualities in an effective company .
