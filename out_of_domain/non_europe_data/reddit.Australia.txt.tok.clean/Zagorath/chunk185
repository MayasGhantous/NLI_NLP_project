  is rank `` 1 '' the best , or rank `` 4 '' ? 
  i assumed the former , but it is n't specified . 
  otherwise , good survey . 
  i 've never heard of them before . 
  is there any advantage to using their sheet music over imslp ? 
  where does it say anything about them paying musicians ? 
  and if that 's true , where does their revenue come from ? 
  i ca n't find it on their site . 
  aww , there i was assuming you loved the kegs themselves and not the stuff that was in them . 
  of course , to any people in high school reading this , that does n't mean you should * disregard * self discipline . 
  you should always strive to do as well as you can , just do n't be too worried if you are n't great at it . 
  i 'm guessing you ask him that because you 've heard of someone this happened to in northern ireland . 
  i 've also heard of it happening in australia , so perhaps it 's not quite as rare as you 'd think/hope . 
  i care ... :(, 
  actually , the phrase in question is a shortened form of `` the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb '' , and means exactly the opposite of what most people think it means . 
  so blood really * is * thicker than water , and you can ( and should ) still pick the people you want in your life . 
  um ... did you reply to the wrong comment or something ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand how this is relevant . 
  did i just read a paragraph about the fleeing nature of human existence which ended with a statement to not worry about it ? 
  this is exactly like the game ... 
  urgh ... i ordered one on 11.04 . 
  still waiting for it to come . 
  the ebay seller has a 31 day refund policy . 
  damn , that thing looks bizarre !, 
  i can definitely see how it would be really awkward to play . 
  what was its timbre like , compared to the standard bb/a soprano and eb sopranino ? 
  regarding clarinet in c , i agree that these days it is almost universally played on a bb transposed up a tone . 
  however , coming from a more orchestral point of view , it 's * incredibly * common . 
  far more than the eb . 
  i mentioned beethoven , symphonies 1 , 5 , and 9 all ask for a clarinet in c for at least part of the piece . 
  hector berlioz requests a c in his symphonie fantastique . 
  1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 . 
  brahms 's 4th ; haydn 's 100th . 
  and that 's just symphonies , and only for those composers ( well , those plus mozart and rachmaninov . 
  i only looked at haydn 's nos . 
  no doubt many of the orchestral parts in concertos also require clarinet in c. ) and some more miscellaneous pieces . 
  side note , you left handed ? 
  on account of the watch on the right hand . 
  i assumed that / u/adrianisawesome ( who you replied to initially ) was saying that you should n't trust people with important things . 
  physical things , yes , like loaning them something , which they might break or lose , or simply forget to return , but also trusting them to * do * things for you . 
  indeed , i felt that the original post was fairly vague . 
  sorry mate , but i disagree . 
  the australian one is by far the best around . 
  the same smallness and portability of the us plug , but with incredible strength such that you do n't need to worry about it wiggling or getting bent . 
  also the extra ground plug can be left out on products that do n't benefit from having it . 
  on yours that plug 's always there . 
  wtf . 
  are those usb things standard/common in the us ? 
  having ~ 240 v rms is pretty standard though . 
  it 's mostly only the us ( and , i assume , the rest of na ) that uses ~ 110 . 
  funny how words have different meanings in different situations . 
  it 's not more efficient in an electrical sense , but it 's much easier to use , for the reasons described above . 
  haha . 
  the pins in those images are * supposed * to be parallel . 
  not german , mind you , but it 's the same `` two-dot '' type plug . 
  ( granted , these are definitely still better than the us . 
  they just do n't hold anything against the uk , which is itself a pain compared to au . ), 
  yeah , the uk plugs are great , but they 're far too bulky , and * always * requiring the ground pin is just a pain . 
  the australian one 's the best . 
  far smaller than the uk , an optional ground , and is still completely sturdy and not prone to bending or wiggle . 
  have you watched the original doctor who ? 
  i got into that as a kid when the abc showed reruns of it ( this was before the new ones started out ) , but i 've never really gotten in to the new doctor . 
  as long as you 're not one of the people described in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opgabvnbpgg ) ( btw , he 's got two more on the topic if you 're interested ) . 
  edit : sincere question , why the downvotes ? 
  the video i linked to was relevant , and basically summed up one side of the argument at hand really nicely . 
  you 're misunderstanding it . 
  think of another meaning of `` ca n't get into '' . 
  i do n't have one . 
  i do n't feel like i * need * one . 
  but i feel that if i had the disposable income it would be awesome to have a tablet . 
  it 's for two things . 
  in the home , browsing the web is so much nicer on a tablet than a computer . 
  it just feels much more comfortable . 
  when travelling ( overseas , to another city , etc. 
  ) , it 's handy to be able to have something that you can take to use for computer needs without having to carry a laptop . 
  especially really useful as a map with gps , using an app like triposo ( or just saved maps in google maps ) . 
   the holes on the socket only open when the earth pin flips the switch in its hole, 
  i never knew they did this . 
  that 's bloody genius !, 
  i 'm still not sure why they need to be quite so large , but at least from a functional standpoint you 've converted me . 
  but you also should n't confuse it with [ pcs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/precordial_catch_syndrome ) , which is completely harmless , if frightening . 
  it 's kinda frightening how easy it is to mistake something completely harmless for something incredibly dangerous , and ( especially ) vice versa . 
  nah , you did n't really miss anything . 
  the text over here is n't the same as the lines from the movie . 
  and i would n't say it * just * came out . 
  2 + weeks is hardly `` just '' . 
  that 's not an excuse for spoilers , of course , though . 
  unsquare dance ? 
  it 's in 7/4 . 
  my favourite version is [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zki4ncz9gtc ) . 
  just because i fricken love the improv solo to build up to the intro . 
  just ignore the fucked up videography . 
  the basic rule of thumb is , if the `` denominator '' is a 4 , ( i.e. , crotchets take the beat ) , multiples of 2 or 3 on the top are easy . 
  if the denominator is an 8 ( quavers take the beat ) , you usually have it in multiples of 3 -- 3/8 , 6/8 , 9/8 , and 12/8 are all common . 
  they 're grouped into 3s , so 6/8 is like having 2/4 with triplet quavers instead of straight quavers . 
  i did now . 
  how weird . 
  yeah , i feel exactly the same way . 
  lyrics give the music a forced emotion , and far too often seem to act as a crutch that prevents the need to add real emotion into the music itself . 
  so many classical pieces have this real , deep , intense emotion behind them , whether it be the unimaginable sadness of [ adagio for strings ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqsge0l450 ) , the heroicness of [ the 1812 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2w1wi2u9sq ) , or the innocent joy of the [ pastoral symphony ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmet5qcsh0s ) , or anything in between .
