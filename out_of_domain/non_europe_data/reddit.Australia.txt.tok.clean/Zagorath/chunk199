  ( certain other programs have tried to make the ribbon interface and have done an appalling job of it , but i digress . ), 
  the ribbon interface in office puts things into a logical location based on how you 're most likely going to use them . 
  it surfaces useful features that were difficult to find before , and makes it far easier to complete common tasks . 
  you may have found it annoying because you were so used to the menu system and are resistant to change , but that 's your problem , not microsoft 's . 
  i ca n't really compare it , i never used matlab on version before they had a ribbon interface . 
  i must agree , though , to the general sentiment of matlab 's interface being good . 
  i was specifically talking about sibelius 7 , which in my opinion has an awful interface . 
  the tabs they used are such that it 's extremely unclear where one particular feature is , and there are a number of features that could very easily fit into at least 2 , if not more , of the tabs . 
  spelling is n't one of them , evidently . 
  well obviously , but this current one also requires a mic to be on . 
  according to [ this page ] ( https://www.google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial/ ) i 'm in the field trial ( it has a button that says `` leave the field trial '' ) , but i do n't actually get * any * results from gmail or drive in my google results . 
  this feature also does n't work . 
  does it work for you ?? 
  i just assumed it was n't actually implemented properly yet . 
  haha i just tried this out . 
  wow this is cool !, 
   who is bill gates ' wife ? 
   how old is she ? 
  48 years ( august 15 , 1964 ), 
   where is she from ? 
  dallas, 
  brilliant , although i did then try `` where is that ? '', 
  and it did n't return anything , although trying `` where is dallas ? '', 
  works and shows a map . 
  does anyone know what other sorts of things you can do with the conversational features ? 
  they do seem fairly limited at the moment . 
  side note , it seems to have my location wrong , for some reason . 
  [ this site ] ( http://htmlfive.appspot.com/static/whereami.html ) , [ this site ] ( http://ctrlq.org/maps/where/ ) , and google maps all have my location correct ( or close enough ) -- brisbane -- but when i ask google search by voice `` will it rain tomorrow ? 
  '' , it gives me the weather for sydney . 
  i 'm confused how someone could be rude/hostile towards op ( rule 2 ) whilst simultaneously agreeing with them ... 
  one of only two elements that is liquid at room temperature , the other being bromine . 
  mercury melts at 234 k , bromine at 256 k. room temperature is roughly 298 k. 
  gallium 's another really fun one . 
  it melts at 303 k : just slightly above room temperature . 
  it 'll melt in your hand ( but wear gloves !, 
  it 's toxic ) . 
  nothing more sensual than [ bol\u00e9ro ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk23bheqvyu ) . 
  i think this is for when you 're in / r/all or something like that . 
  evidently , you can add / r/australia to that list . 
  ah , right . 
  fair enough , thanks . 
  hmm ... are you in the us ? 
  i wonder if this is a feature only available to america ... 
  worked fine last time i was at chermside . 
  they definitely have n't been in westfield chermside for 10 years . 
  pretty sure it 's been less than 5 years . 
  but yes , they do have them . 
  i 'm exactly the same , though in my case it 's about the ps3 's exclusives ( there are n't * any * that i personally care about on xbox ) and the controller ( seems to against popular opinion , but i ca n't stand the xbox controller , but love the ps one ) . 
  that said , i do n't actually own any 7th gen consoles ( only a ps2 that has n't been used in years ) . 
  last i checked australian police are police , so he was correct , even if not as precise as he could have been . 
  haha hello again . 
  yup , that 's it . 
  but i think we do care about a very large number of people . 
  not about the small things , but certainly enough to be interested when they 're doing things out of the ordinary . 
  things like getting married and having children , but slightly smaller things like going on holiday somewhere interesting , getting a new job , etc. 
  also because they 're people we know to some extent , many of us care more about their recommendations for films , restaurants , etc. 
  than we do random internet people . 
  sure , i do n't care about the minutiae of their lives , but things like that have relevance to me . 
  i just wish they 'd share that stuff on g + rather than facebook . 
  i like that facebook exists , but i hate the site . 
  it absolutely destroys photos , it handles events in such an awful way , it makes creating `` lists '' of friends for specific purposes so difficult ( compared to g + circles ) , and i get far less control over what i actually see . 
  compared to g + , it 's absolutely awful . 
  but i like the fact that it exists and allows me to keep up with people i otherwise probably would n't . 
  i just think it handles that stuff far worse than google + does . 
  what part did you mean to link to in the first one ? 
  you linked to the start of the video . 
  my god , thank you for linking this . 
  i must have missed it when it first came ` round . 
   so this is n't even a note of music . 
   ... you have the choir , often chilling out in a choir loft or otherwise separated from the floor . 
  usually they 'll be sitting because who wants to stand around for 30 minutes ... while the symphony slaves away on the first three movements ? 
   and then it 's time for the fourth movement . 
   and in the silence/cough break/time to try to resuscitate your leg which fell asleep halfway through the scherzo , suddenly a hundred people stand up . 
  and then you know ** shit is about to get real ** . 
    and that moment where a hundred voices suddenly inhale . 
  wow , brilliant description of what must be an amazing moment . 
  sorry , but that 's not quite accurate . 
  they 're just variant spellings of the same word . 
  hey , thanks for this . 
  i 've downloaded the library and got the two sensors connected up as shown , but i ca n't figure out how to actually get it to choose which sensor 's data is being read . 
  any chance you could explain how to do it ? 
  even if the other movies did n't exist , i think that yes , it would still count as a remake . 
  it would be taking a story that has already been made , and retelling it . 
  does n't matter that it 's a different medium . 
  it 's a photographic trick . 
  the focus has been messed with so that there 's a really short depth of field , which your eye interprets as meaning it must be a small object . 
  see [ tilt shift photography ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tilt%e2%80%93shift_photography ), 
   or a related bachelor of science degree, 
  i 'm curious as to whether a bachelor of engineering majoring in software engineering would also count for this . 
  it 's probably more relevant to a comp sci master 's than any bachelor of science apart from computer science would be . 
   from the data , it can also be shown that prime numbers have little to do with the guessing of `` random numbers '' as shown by this chart . 
  31 % of all numbers you got were primes . 
  there are 25 primes below 100 . 
  i ca n't remember enough of my high school statistics to do the hypothesis test , but considering how large your sample size was , i think that you would end up rejecting h0 ( that u = 25 ) in favour of h1 ( that u  25 ) , because the result you 've gotten is significantly greater than would be expected in a uniform distribution . 
  ~ ~ edit : ok , so like i said , i do n't remember much of my high school maths in stats , but i just put the information into my ti-84 , and if i 've done it correctly ( i think i probably have n't ) , then it leaves you very confident that the data does n't fit . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ \u03c3 = 28.8675 ( sqrt ( 100 ^ 2 / 12 ) , based on my maths information booklet stating variance = ( b-a ) ^ 2 / 12 ) ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ x-bar = 50 ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ returns p = 0 , z = 25.98076 ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ again , there 's a good chance i 've used the wrong values , or even done a completely wrong test , so this may not be correct ... ~ ~, 
  editedit : redacted previous edit , as i 'm pretty certain that it was wrong .
