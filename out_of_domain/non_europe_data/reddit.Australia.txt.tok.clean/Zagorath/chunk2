  casting spells causes people to hear you . 
  there 's a perk in the illusion tree that makes all spells invisible , so you 'll need to get that . 
  you could always just get a better dagger . 
  that 's my best advice , really . 
  for whatever reason , steam does n't recognise my skyrim as being * the * skyrim . 
  at least , i ** think ** that 's the reason it 's not working . 
  whatever the reason is , i 've subscribed to it in steam , and it 's not downloading ... 
  like i said , for some reason the steam library does n't recognise my skyrim . 
  when i open the game , no message comes up . 
  it just opens as normal . 
  skyrim 's my first elder scrolls game , but i feel confident in guessing that morrowind had a better storyline . 
  i , for one , found finishing the main quest in skyrim to be a massive anticlimax . 
  it just did n't mean that much to me . 
  what does it say that i read that as 5th grade elf ? 
  seems to me like the image has been taken down ... 
  there 's a perk where if you are n't wearing any armour , the effect of alteration spells such as iron flesh is doubled . 
  i 've not used that extensively , but both elder scrolls wiki and uesp say that he counts as a summon , so you can not have both him and , say , a storm atronach . 
  this is just horrible . 
  teachers are massively underpaid already . 
  they do a job that is absolutely crucial to a country 's future , and they get treated like shit . 
  students ( in western countries ) , for the most part , act like they do n't want to be there , and make teachers ' jobs harder . 
  the public complains about them being greedy , lazy , etc. 
  ( please ** someone ** tell me why this is , even if you do n't agree with it yourself , just try to explain * their * reasoning ) . 
  i 'm lucky to live in asia , where students and parents really do respect teachers . 
  where teachers are valued . 
  the pay still is n't * great * , but it 's a very acceptable amount . 
  imo , if western countries want even a hope of fixing their long-term economic situations , they need to radically fix ** attitudes ** towards education . 
  it may be hard to change the minds of teenagers , but the attitudes of adults being how it is certainly is n't helping . 
  paarthurnax is definitely cool . 
  i never considered killing him . 
  i did the imperial questline , but i did it quite late in the game , and found it incredibly easy . 
  apparently the enemies in those quests do n't level ... 
  i doubt that aspect of the stormcloak is different , although i do suspect the storyline of the quest would probably be more exciting . 
  if i play a second character , definitely going stormcloak . 
  yeah , i noticed that too !!, 
  really annoying - . -, 
  i had a tough time deciding which side , both made strong arguments in my opinion . 
  in the end i went with what i felt my character would be more likely to do . 
  as a dark elf , i do n't think i would have sided with the stormcloaks , after seeing the state of the grey quarter . 
  an interesting prospect , but i do n't think i 'll do it . 
  i suspect i 'll get bored of my current character eventually , and it 'll be then that i start a new one . 
  if that never happens , then i 'll eventually follow your advice . 
  haha , just mars ? 
  half of the star wars themes seem to be ` borrowed ' from elsewhere . 
  holst 's the planets is an obvious one , but also a lot from stravinsky . 
  also , does the imperial march sound an awful lot like chopin 's funeral march ? 
  i agree , i find it very hard to believe that this is true . 
  however , mgmuscari above is correct in that they owned the car . 
  it 's like he was giving them the money to pay for it , not he paying for it directly . 
  i could be wrong though , and if anyone can find reference to it actually being the law that any money * he * earns when * he * is working belonging to his parents , i 'll be glad ( well ... that 's not the right word ) to admit i 'm wrong . 
  which movement do you want ? 
  and , do you want a recording , or written sheet music ? 
  me too !, 
  found it out less than two days ago . 
  really handy !, 
  yeah , i did n't even take that much note of its awesomeness at the time , was too worried about not being killed . 
  wait , so this means that any money earned by someone under the age of 18 legally belongs to their parents ? 
  he had good hearing in his early stages , but it began to fade during his middle era . 
  by the time he wrote this great symphony , he was completely deaf . 
  interesting point , a study of his string quartets have found that as his hearing faded , he used less and less high notes ( as these pitches faded faster ) . 
  however , when he became totally deaf , as he was relying entirely on his inner ear , these high pitches returned . 
  well , not * quite * . 
  it was a riot , at a performance of classical music , true . 
  however , it was largely because of the political climate already at the event , and with the choreography , rather than the music itself . 
  all also from that very wikipedia page . 
  sorry to break it to you , but the riots at the debut of the rite of spring were not inherently about the music . 
  they were more to do with the political climate and the choreography . 
  really liked this comment !, 
  disagree about the title of the cd being ` exactly what it ... is ' . 
  to me , when i read that title , i think it 's a cd designed to get people who are normally interested in rock and pop genres interested in classical music . 
  clearly that 's not what it is , but that 's what i thought it would be . 
  17 y/o here , and i love classical music . 
  i realise i 'm the exception , but it 's actually my favourite genre of music . 
  followed by jazz , and then the rest . 
  no one owns the rights to those pieces . 
  bach , beethoven , and brahms are all public domain now . 
  however , the people who have recorded them have done so in recent times , and as a result their recordings are , fairly , in copyright . 
  as for being blocked in germany , i 've noticed that . 
  i have a couple of videos on my own channel that are `` blocked in germany '' , but quite literally no where else . 
  it 's something the people need to fix , because clearly the government is n't going to do it without a major uprising . 
  i thought the uniform debate was for audiences . 
  i definitely agree that the orchestra/choir should have strict dress codes . 
  however , often audience members are frowned upon if their dress is not up to code . 
  i think that is something that discourages some who would like to attend classical music concerts from doing so . 
  hahaha , i agree . 
  also annoying , the parents themselves , when they go to see their child perform in a school concert or the like . 
  i both love and hate this fact . 
  there are times when i really only want to listen to , say , the 5th movement of symphonie fantastique , as various movements can have significantly different styles . 
  often they can sound great by themselves . 
  however , i also love to listen to symphonies and concertos in their full . 
  you really do appreciate the work as a whole so much more by doing this . 
  with regards to the clapping , i 've seen many anecdotes on this very page suggesting that clapping between movements was common in the 19th and 18th centuries , and i do n't fully understand why we should confine ourselves to the end of the entire piece before applauding the performers . 
  oh wow that 's brilliant . 
  really clever . 
  i 'm more often in the concert , so going to actually see a professional orchestra is a great experience for me . 
  never done it free though !!, 
  that 's really cool !, 
  hahaha , i suspect that earlier classical concerts i went to i was probably more the fidgety type . 
  i do n't really know though , it 's too long ago for me to remember . 
  thanks ,
