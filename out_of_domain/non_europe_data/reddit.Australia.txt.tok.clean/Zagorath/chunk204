  who you are talking to is irrelevant . 
  most of this runs under the assumption that what your founding fathers did over 200 years ago is still the most appropriate way of handling things in today 's society . 
  society today is completely different to it was back then . 
  things are more interconnected , people are aware far more of what 's going on in another state , let alone across the world . 
  there are far more advantages to having a strong federal government ( relative to state governments ) than there are disadvantages . 
  separated education and healthcare systems , for example , create far more bureaucracy , with multiple layers within each state , rather than a single board . 
  with education it 's especially bad , as it creates incompatible curricula that make moving to another state for university ( or half way through your primary/secondary schooling ) more difficult that it should be . 
  i would say it makes for more sense to fix laws for everyone , rather than have some places stuck with outdated laws while some can move forward . 
  but you did n't really answer my main question . 
  what has any of this got to do with your opinion on abortion ? 
  why make such a big deal about how it 's `` murder '' , but then say it 's ok if states legalise it ? 
  you 're just digging yourself deeper here . 
  comparing it to cubes and spheres has to be one of the worst false analogies ( a tute of fallacy ) i 've come across . 
  it does n't even make sense . 
  sure there are different groups that use the term libertarian , but that does n't mean it 's incorrect to use libertarian to refer to any one of these groups . 
  i find it interesting that you say `` of all pieces '' . 
  i would have thought verkl\u00e4rte nacht was a much more extreme piece , musically , than le sacre . 
  agree that le sacre is far from the birth of the modern era , though . 
  then again , i ca n't say i 've ever heard anyone claim as such . 
  you used the spoiler tags wrong . 
  think of it like a link with reddit formatting , where the text goes in square brackets and the link is / spoiler ( in normal/rounded brackets ) . 
  [ this message is blocked out ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i love that despite the clear instructions , 9 people still gave their answer to random letter in lower case . 
  anyway , the lack of randomness in the number is not at all surprising ( it 's well known that people have a tendency to pick 7 ) . 
  interesting that the distribution of people 's sex is more even than the heads and tails ( even despite reddit 's demographic bias !, 
  whoa really ? 
  we even have it here in australia ( albeit a much nerfed version compared to the us ) . 
   and you can end up with lots of duplicates further down the line once you figure out the things that you do like, 
  oh god yes . 
  i have no less than 5 copies of the 1812 overture . 
  5 different versions of beethoven 's 5th ( only two complete . 
  one that 's only 2nd movement , two only 1st movement ) . 
  3 copies of bol\u00e9ro , and a heap of other duplicates . 
  not that i mind . 
  those are all awesome !, 
  happy cake day scrumptious !, 
  on the confirmed submission page , it has a button to see them . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  when i did it , there was a fairly significant bias in favour of heads . 
  nothing huge , but a few percentage points . 
  male-female was 50 % -50 % when rounded , with one or two difference in terms of numbers . 
  i guess that as sample size increases you would expect it to tend towards a more equal result , so that definitely makes sense . 
  [ here you go !,

  hmm ... thanks for the tip , but i tried and could n't find a way of actually doing it . 
  it seems to have the infrastructure there for using a variety of different lists , but one of those is not `` create your own '' . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i was confusing it with something else . 
  i ca n't remember what , though ... 
  i dunno , 19 hours after your comment and i 'm still getting, 
   aw , snap !, 
   sorry , we could n't connect to any websockets servers, 
  i think that was exactly why truxwork mentioned it . 
  yeah , but they 're an absolute pain in the arse to manage . 
  no , he 's right . 
  facebook has had lists for longer than g + has been around . 
  that said , they 're an absolute pain to use on fb . 
  again with the right handed ? 
  oooo !, 
  was going over alicia 's history , she mentioned something about uq psychology website for participating in other studies . 
  i googled , and they have what seems at first glance [ a really simple process ] ( http://www.psy.uq.edu.au/community/participate.html ) for participating in their studies . 
  awesome if you 're ineligible for this one , i suspect/hope . 
  yeah you 're right that this subreddit does n't support them , but he 's edited it . 
  [ spoiler ] what he had before was incorrect even for those subreddits where it does work . 
  [ / spoiler ], 
   unavailable from your location, 
  i 'm going to be really unoriginal and say beethoven 's 9th , mozart 's requiem , and carmina burana . 
  sure they 're super well-known and somewhat unoriginal in their inclusion here , but they 're well-known for a goddam reason . 
  they 're very easily among the best pieces ever created . 
  though i would argue the latter two there are choral pieces with orchestra , not orchestral pieces with choir . 
  so that would leave me with just beethoven 's 9th . 
  it 's a mistake ? 
  i just assumed it meant `` do you feel compelled to tip a different amount [ i.e. , either more or less ] than you would ... '' . 
  i assume you 're joking here , but if not , source ? 
  whoa what ? 
  doctors in australia have an obligation to act even when of duty ? 
  that 's a pretty shitty law . 
  what if they 're fatigued or have been drinking ( both of which are likely on a plane ) ? 
  anyone know more about this ? 
  how does this relate to whatever good samaritan laws we have here ? 
   6 or 7 do n't think its really worth spending 5 or 6 xmps on for the 75 ap, 
  damn , if that 's true , they 're not thinking clearly . 
  it 's worth 75 + 500 if you then capture it , and + all the rest of the ap from adding resos after that , if you choose to . 
  very clever novelty account , or just relevant username ? 
  pyrespirit showed no more evidence of being knowledgeable in the area than animej did . 
  we get this question a lot , so i 'd strongly recommend doing a search to get more results , if only because they responses vary each time , and it can be helpful to note what responses are most common . 
  i would say the best thing to work out is what sort of classical music you like . 
  you 've got a long journey ahead if you do choose to delve into the fantastic world of classical music , and it 's relatively normal for you to not enjoy it all at first . 
  heck , you may find that you can never get into some sorts . 
  i 'd start with some bach and vivaldi , from the baroque era . 
  parts of vivaldi 's [ four seasons ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grxofemo3ha ) are incredibly well-known , so give them a listen , but try listening to the whole thing rather than just the two or three famous movements . 
  i 'm no expert in bach , but he has a huge range of works , so i hope someone else can give you good suggestions from him . 
  moving on to classical-era music , you should try some mozart , haydn , and early beethoven . 
  mozart 's [ 40th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtc1mdieqi8 ) and [ 41st ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnk3kh8zega ) symphonies , his concertos ( in particular , i would name the [ 21st piano concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uyb6bmkyi ) , the [ horn concertos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_xt7gjpp9a ) , and the [ clarinet concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2onnugi3ylu ) ) , and his absolutely stunning [ requiem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=splhkp0nzii ) . 
  haydn 's another one i do n't know very well , but a good place to start is his london symphonies , particularly the ones with names : [ military ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwdg9mtujsw ) , [ clock ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvlac9agiqq ) , [ drumroll ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0hz8wxc-bs ) , and [ london ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffbk-eyjs90 ) . 
  great pieces by early beethoven include his earlier piano sonatas , [ path\u00e9tique ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luo4wuqmwyy ) and [ moonlight ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0urrwyiz74 ) . 
  moving on to romantic era ( my personal favourite ) , you have later beethoven , tchaikovsky , and satie , who you 've met before . 
  for beethoven , this is where you get into his symphonies . 
  i would recommend [ 5th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzs-oggkztu ) , [ 3rd ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxt4s6wqf4 ) , [ 6th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w-oeq_qqga ) , [ 7th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=albhai7ohau ) , and [ 9th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217h8jppi ) , in that order . 
  the only reason 9th comes last here is because of its immense length , although musically i would say it 's probably the greatest of his works .
