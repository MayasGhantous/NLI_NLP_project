  tchaikovsky , try his [ 1812 overture ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbxgylcnxe8 ) and his ballets , [ nutcracker ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8j8urc_8jw ) and [ swan lake ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdhq70yrtii ) . 
  satie has his well-known gymnopedies , but also try his [ gnossiennes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuaf3abgy2m ) if you have n't before . 
  i particularly like 1 and 3 ( there are 6 total , plus 1 that 's sometimes also included ) . 
  then you get to the 20th century . 
  here there 's a lot of stuff that can be excruciatingly awful if you leap straight in , so i 'm linking some of the more accessible stuff , but to be honest i still prefer these ones anyway . 
  you have stravinsky , copland , and shostakovich . 
  stravinsky 's [ rite of spring ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujoagihg7a ) ( which recently celebrated its 100 year anniversary ! ), 
  is absolutely amazing , and sparked riots at its debut ( though an explanation of why makes this less interesting than it sounds ) , and his [ firebird ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzkiavglfwk ) is also great . 
  copland is an american composer who will make you think of wild-west usa . 
  his [ rodeo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gsat9nby60 ) and [ el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69uvfyh1lke ) are a good start . 
  shostakovich , i do n't know too well , but his symphonies are absolutely awesome , here 's his [ 5th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktqsu7tqw48 ) . 
  other random pieces from throughout music history you should try :, 
  berlioz 's [ symphonie fantastique ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbpb-pzaq80 ) ( particularly the last two movements , timecodes for those are in the top comments ), 
  gershwin 's [ rhapsody in blue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yneoo28lsbc ) ( jazz-classical fusion ), 
  orff 's [ carmina buranna ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qellleco4om ) , particularly o fortuna ( which you have doubtless heard before : it 's right at the beginning ), 
  to introduce you to the different instruments , there 's benjamin britten 's [ young person 's guide to the orchestra ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfffqxnqbui ) , which , beyond being educational , is actually just awesome music . 
  dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's [ symphony from the new world ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etnopqyaipi ) . 
  rave ' l [ bol\u00e9ro ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk23bheqvyu ) , an interesting study in timbre , or musical colour . 
  it repeats the same melody over and over again with different combinations of instruments , in what is the world 's longest continuous musical crescendo . 
  good luck on your journey , if you do decide to continue it . 
  it 's an awesome world of music out there , and i really hope you can get to enjoy it as much as i do !, 
  you 're at about the same age as i was when i first started listening to classical music , though i was never really into anything specific before that . 
  feel free to randomly pick and choose from all the links i 've given . 
  there 's a lot there , so i do n't expect you to listen to it all . 
  edit : dvo\u0159\u00e1k , not dvork, 
   how do i not feel pretentious while listening to classical music ? 
  my only real answer to this is : `` you just do n't '' . 
  do n't feel or act as though by listening to classical music you 're * better * than everyone else , and you are n't going to be pretentious . 
  i made [ a playlist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqwhgslwavo0avbktlojinr2mpmqysedx&amp;feature=mh_lolz ) of music i listen to when i need to be kept awake and on-task, 
   apple users are generally not a technology-inclined group of people, 
  except that the same is true of windows users , which makes that an irrelevant thing to say . 
  the difference is that among techie people ( tech journos , developers , people involved in media production ) , macs are far more common . 
   high resolution screens ( which could be in standard laptops too if some companies got their shit together, 
  funnily enough , apple started a trend in that direction , and there seems to be a slow progression with other companies now , too . 
  it 'll be commonplace in a few years , without a doubt . 
  take a look at mse . 
  it 's free , completely non-bloaty , * and * has a really slick interface . 
  i have n't really used one very much , but i 'm not a big fan of their new mouses . 
  i also did n't like the old mighty mouse design . 
  huge fan of their touchpads on their laptops , though . 
  only touchpad i can actually use without needing to plug in a mouse ( even done some gaming with it : played all through both portal games on one ) . 
  it sounds more or less like you 're looking for justification for why you prefer geography over economics , and that 's totally fine . 
  go with geography . 
  fwiw , i did economics , but job prospects were irrelevant to me , as i knew whatever i end up doing it would not be relevant to any group 3 subject , so i just chose one that was interesting . 
  no , i 'm talking about all techies . 
  what do you mean by `` techs '' ? 
  people who work in it departments at companies ? 
  because those are just one type of people i would consider `` techies '' , and in my experience they tend to be quite backwards in relation to technology , unlike most other techies . 
  far more resistant to change than most other people involved in technology , either as enthusiasts or professionally . 
  is it relevant ? 
  if one just happens to not be physically attracted to people from any particular race , does it matter what that race is ? 
  i agree with you , however i would like to present a slightly alternate version . 
  ianal , and my entire argument here is based on reading [ one wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plea_bargain#other_common_law_jurisdictions ) , so someone please correct me if my interpretation of that article is wrong . 
  in england and wales , as well as victoria in australia , plea bargaining exists in a different form . 
  in those places , if both prosecutors and defense agree to it , they can enter into an agreement whereby the defendant pleads guilty to some charges and drops the remainder . 
  for example , if someone were to trespass in order to steal , he could then agree to plead guilty to the theft , but not be charged with trespassing . 
  the punishment for the theft would then still be ( as far as i know ) the same , but the lesser charge of trespassing would be ignored . 
  this probably is n't the best example of how it would be used , but in general i imagine bargains are used to save the court 's time , while still getting a fair end result by preserving the majority of charges . 
  alternatively , in a more general sense , if a defendant pleads guilty * without * necessarily having a guarantee of a significantly lower sentence , that can be a sign of remorse . 
  since gaol time is fundamentally more about rehabilitation than punishment , showing remorse is already a significant step along the way to being rehabilitated , and so having a lower sentence makes sense . 
  however when done merely as a plea bargain , it is not a good idea . 
  fair point . 
  i assumed you were asking because it would affect how you responded to op 's question . 
  if it 's just for curiosity , then that 's fine . 
  i also read it , and it did n't come across as satirical in the slightest . 
  your analogy of cars is fallacious , because normal , lower-end cars do n't have the same problems of usability that cheaper computers can have . 
  imagine instead that you 're talking about someone who just uses his car to drive to and from work , pick up the kids from school , and down to the shop . 
  he 's in his car maybe 5 hours a week * , and not pushing it very hard . 
  however , he 's got a car that stutters and jerks a lot , maybe even breaks down regularly , and he 's not an expert and does n't know how to fix it . 
  then compare to a `` higher end '' car that does n't have these issues , and is in fact on par with what a standard car is capable of today . 
  that makes the analogy a little better . 
  * assuming a 20 min commute to work , plus 10 `` extra '' minutes 5 days a week , somewhat of an underestimate for many people , i suspect, 
  honestly , it 's mainly a historical carry-over . 
  there was a time when macs were the only way you could get serious editing done . 
  i do n't know what the reason was , but i suspect it 's purely because decent software was n't available for that on windows . 
  these days , avid and adobe both have the industry standard software available on windows , and so a lot of serious work * can * be done on that platform . 
  however , macs are still used because many of the professionals are used to that platform . 
  additionally , there 's still final cut pro , which is still a major tool that many people use , such that if you 're a serious editor you 're usually going to need access to it occasionally in working with others , even if it 's not your primary editing tool . 
  edit : that 's just one example , but the case is similar in other fields . 
  not able to use keyboard shortcuts ? 
  i ca n't say i 've ever really had a problem with that . 
  there are definitely a few less , but for the most part you can do the same things with the keyboard you could do on windows . 
  what specific things have they had problems with ? 
  what does that indicate ? 
  is a transman a male who feels like a female , or the opposite ? 
  i have a hunch in the latter case as to what the reason may be , though it is n't more than a hunch . 
  ah , right . 
  my hunch , then , is that more men `` choose '' ( not using that word fairly ) to be transwomen because being a somewhat masculine female is , in today 's society , far more acceptable than being a feminine male . 
  it really is just a hunch , though . 
  i 've got very little knowledge about this area . 
  yeah , me too . 
  i pronounce it like `` imager '' without the `` a '' . 
  [ ipa : / \u026amd\u0292\u0259r / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_english ) . 
  i selected the second option because it felt closer to my pronunciation . 
  ah awesome , thanks for the info !, 
  seeing this request from a mod makes it seem really sinister . 
  haha yeah , i get that . 
  it 's just the fact that you 've got the mod badge on ( green outline ) , plus how simple and direct it was . 
  it came across as slightly threatening . 
  which made it really cool to read , fwiw .
