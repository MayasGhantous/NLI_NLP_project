  could you explain this a bit more ? 
  why does this work ? 
  ( formulae are nice  ), 
   most people in qld dont have a choice, 
  pretty basic stuff , really . 
  thanks . 
  ( although side note , other comments seem to imply it 's been privatised , and thus not owned by the qld govt . 
  ; i could be wrong though , i do n't really know . ), 
  [ guy just above you has a good answer ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1fkjup/interested_in_watching_a_new_sport_australias/cabixm2?context=3 ), 
  tl ; dr , attendance is a useless stat , and fanbases are roughly equal . 
  i did n't see it before , but now yeah , he does look like defranco !, 
   it 's been shown that when you try to argue with someone about a social opinion by simply telling them they are wrong ... the conversation will simply cause both parties to become even further entrenched in their original views, 
  i do n't find this hard to believe at all , intuitively , but do you have a source for it ? 
  really interesting . 
  huh , til . 
  does the breaking of surface tension not factor into it ? 
  photosphere is a feature in the android built-in camera app for creating a variety of panorama-like photos . 
  * you can do photos like op 's , known as '' ** tiny planets ** '', 
  * you can make them so that users can scroll around them in a sort of virtual world [ see here for an example ] ( https://plus.google.com/108037295085084638028/posts/8vze5rnhubx ) , though you will probably need to click on the photo to get it to show up in the correct way, 
  * and you can create normal panorama photos , like the one you see in the above link before you click on it , or like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1fiu42/took_this_picture_of_a_lake_in_denver_and_turned/cab8m5i?context=3 ) that someone made out of op 's photo ( no idea how they did that : this one was done by photoshopping the original , not directly from android 's camera ) . 
  this one in particular does n't , but the concept of `` tiny planets '' from photosphere are definitely really reminiscent of le petit prince . 
  to be honest , if you did n't know the etymology of the phrase either one makes sense . 
  it actually comes from `` hear him , hear him '' , and you 're indicating you want people to , well , hear what he has to say . 
  but there 's no reason that `` here here '' could n't also mean `` pay attention here '' . 
  the only people who really live in antarctica are scientists , so actually yes , they do use metric . 
  '' ~ trigger warning ~ '' what is this , and why is it necessary here ? 
  the most obvious thing that comes to mind is triggering something ptsd-related , but i ca n't see how it would . 
  whoa what the fuck dude ? 
  i was with you until `` restrict the military to males only '' . 
  i mean , i know the military is famous for being conservative , but do you really think that 's the right step forward ? 
  ah right . 
  probably best that you specify that , though , is n't it ? 
  i mean , great job on having the forethought to put the warning there to help people , but it is n't much use if they might not no what it 's talking about , is it ? 
  i disagree . 
  conservative politics , fundamentally , want to preserve a historical norm , while progressive politics want to move forward into what they see as a more modern and advanced society . 
  in this case , having equal gender/sex rights . 
  it is a fact that some women can do the jobs required in the military better than some men . 
  if they are able to do it at the level required for the military , why the hell should they not be allowed in ? 
  hmm , [ this ] ( http://www.avatarchapters.tv/watch-chapter/legend-of-aang/1 ) is working for me in australia . 
  it 's unbearably slow , despite my very fast connection , but it does work . 
  anecdotal , but i did a double-blind taste-test with someone i know who claims to be able to tell the difference . 
  got 4 glasses of coke and 4 of pepsi . 
  subject managed to pick every one of them . 
  just so you know , they [ have n't yet got a policy on this issue ] ( http://www.australiandemocrats.org.au/national_broadband_network ) . 
  sure , if they 've got any sense ( and it certainly seems that they do ) they 'll keep fttp , but there 's no guarantee . 
  [ for sensible politics that * definitely * supports the nbn . 
  ] ( http://greens.org.au/ ), 
  yeah , i agree completely . 
  the only policy i do n't like from the greens is on drugs . 
  i do n't do any drugs , heck i barely even drink , but i fully support legalisation of marijuana and decriminalisation of most other currently illegal drugs . 
  yeah , i agree completely .

  australia has a very different culture to america on these issues . 
  these things are banned because most people in australia agree they should be banned , and so the slippery slope argument does n't apply . 
  you 're being sarcastic , but in australia that 's largely true . 
  muggings at gunpoint just do n't happen , and the only drive-by-shootings are gangs shooting at rival gangs . 
  that 's why americans trying to argue about australian laws based on american culture is never going to convince anyone . 
  i 'm assuming you 're american , but in australia unless you 're one of those things , you * do n't * have to be worried about being shot . 
  i 'm sick of americans trying to argue about australian laws based on some idea that people might need to be protected from guns , when australia does n't have an issue with gun violence like the us does . 
  no , it 's not . 
  he obviously means mass shootings , and since port arthur -- after which gun reform was implemented -- there has n't been a single mass shooting . 
  i love that we 're having a debate about religion in arda in / r/classicalmusic . 
  even if you 're looking for over 18s to * do * the survey , it does n't mean that the people that they know who suffered the problem could n't be under 18 . 
  edit : and what do we put for `` how did you hear about this '' ? 
  is reddit a community noticeboard ? 
  i ticked that and typed `` reddit '' . 
  ah right , cool . 
  yeah that 's what i selected . 
  anyway , i look forward to the second half of the study , and the results . 
  cool survey . 
  huh , thanks for that , i did n't know . 
  however , they 're still not in favour of full legalisation of marijuana , which i am . 
  as someone who * does n't * do marijuana , it 's not a big issue to me , though . 
  certainly not enough to sway my vote in any direction . 
  because that 's how it * is * pronounced . 
  i 'm curious , would it be * possible * for scotland to declare itself a republic * without * breaking off from the uk , in much the same way that it is sometimes discussed in australia ? 
   there 's only one specific class of workers who are essentially immune - the people who write the software and build the chips and design the robots, 
  kinda playing devil 's advocate , kinda just being a pedantic dick , but this is n't entirely true . 
  if/when we reach technological singularity , computers will be able to write the software that runs themselves better than humans can . 
  but thanks , i had a similar view to op , but you 've definitely changed my mind on that . 
  ( and i 'm glad of it , too , since i 'm currently studying software engineering . ), 
  i really wish more people could understand the principle of externalities ... 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ looking ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ libertarians ), 
  just so you know , you 're not really supposed to be posting on behalf of someone else . 
  if you want them to change their mind , perhaps see if you could get them on to do a cmv . 
  faqs :, 
   can i make a post on behalf of someone ? 
  no , we 'd prefer if that person could engage directly with the users here . 
  cgpgrey 's video is great , but does n't really address the issue of whether scotland could stop recognising the queen but still remain in the uk . 
  were it to happen , it would completely change the dynamics in that video . 
  ( but i * suspect * it ca n't happen , so the point would be moot . ), 
  second edit, 
  there is no membership status . 
  british isles is a purely geographic term for that group of islands . 
  you ca n't secede from your geographic location . 
  that would be like canada deciding it wants to secede from north america . 
  you can dispute the name if you like , though apart from ireland most of the world still agrees on that name . 
  but thank you , that was really funny . 
  another upcoming game , beyond : two souls .
