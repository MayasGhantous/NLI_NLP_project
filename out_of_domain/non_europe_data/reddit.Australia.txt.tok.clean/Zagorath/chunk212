  america needs to pay workers a fair wage ( by removing exceptions from minimum wage for tipped employees , and * possibly * raising minimum wage ) and somehow work on the culture of tipping . 
  but outlawing it is ridiculous . 
  if i decide , for example , that the amount of change i 'll get from my bill is n't worth collecting -- and the server has done a good job -- why should i not be allowed to say `` keep the change '' ? 
  the point is , you ca n't make a cmv arguing `` tipping should be made illegal '' , and then dismiss people who think it should be removed as a social construct but not banned . 
  the wording of your op is bad . 
   the point is that i believe society should stand against tipping, 
  but i do n't disagree with that stand . 
  in fact , i * strongly * support it . 
  i disagree with any regulation to force it , apart from allowing servers to be paid well ( by raising minimum wage and , more importantly , removing laws exempting employers from paying minimum wage for tippable jobs ) . 
  if i decide i want to tip , i should be allowed to . 
  it 's not going to hurt anybody else , and * especially * in the situation that it 's not a cultural norm , it 's going to make that server 's day , which in turn would make me feel good . 
  and if that 's in response to especially good service , or just because i 'm in a really generous mood , why should n't i be allowed to make someone feel better ? 
  now , i 'm at risk of violating rule 3 here , but * you are being unwilling to change your view * . 
  you 've even stated as much in the op . 
  your initial cmv is about making tipping * illegal * , and yet you then go on to state that we need to argue the * benefits * of tipping , a somewhat unrelated issue . 
  you 're essentially stating , without reason , that you will not accept arguments against your opinion except for those that agree with your perceived `` opposite '' of your opinion . 
  that 's for mods to decide , not you . 
   just . 
  fuck you . 
  you wasted my time and i have spent seven years specializing in data analysis . 
  it is hard enough to get a large enough sample to not be underpowered based on expected effect size , and your choice was to create a time-suck with no true value . 
  trying to create measures with strong psychometric properties is a sisyphean task already . 
  please think about who you are hurting before you choose to do something similar in the future . 
  i do wish you a lovely day . 
  just please consider consequences . 
  saw this going through the responses . 
  but seriously , do n't make hundreds of matrix questions people , more often than not it 'll just get me to quit . 
  at about 0:12 it bears a strong resemblance to debussy 's clair de lune . 
  as my high school economics teacher said , if you put 5 economists in a room , you 'll end up with 6 opinions . 
  the simple fact is that economics is incredibly imprecise , and different economists assess the same situation in many different ways . 
  there is n't one correct answer . 
  i only down voted you because you said you down voted him because he said he would be . 
  a lot of this is good advice , but misses out some important first aid stuff . 
  do ** not ** suck the venom out , wash the area , or use an `` arterial '' tourniquet , which could block off the circulation . 
  you got this much correct . 
  experts recommend the pressure immobilisation technique for snake bites ( as well as certain other animals , though not many , so if unsure it 's best not to do it ) . 
  * if on a limb , apply a broad pressure bandage as soon as possible . 
  elasticised bandages ( 10 -- 15 cm ) preferred over crepe . 
  use clothing or other material if neither are available . 
  * bandage should be firm and tight , you should not be able to easily slide a finger between bandage and skin . 
  * then apply further pressure bandage commencing at the finger or toe of the limb , moving upwards to cover as much of the limb as possible . 
  do this * over * their existing clothing if possible . 
  * splint the limb . 
  splint can be incorporated under layers of bandage . 
  for the upper limb , use a sling . 
  * keep the victim and the limb completely at rest . 
  if it 's not on a limb , apply firm direct pressure to the wound , but do not restrict breathing , and do n't apply pressure to the neck or head .

  yup , that 's the one .

   `` heteroskedasticity '' is not a word , slang or formal , that i 'm familiar with, 
  the commas there are parenthetical ( i.e. , they serve more or less the same purpose as if he had put it in brackets ) . 
  thus it becomes :, 
   `` heteroskedasticity '' is not a word that i 'm familiar with, 
  he was n't claiming it 's not a word , just a word he does n't know .

  i 've never heard if this , and it makes no sense , since nearly everyone uses one of these major free providers . 
  is n't the image a bit small for a desktop image , anyway ? 
  why have them walk in at the end ? 
  would n't it make more sense to position them how you want beforehand ( so you 've got more time to get them exactly right ) , then have the flash go off at the beginning of the photo ? 
  agree completely . 
  film music can be unbelievably awesome , but zimmer is n't . 
  john williams and howard shore are two examples of brilliant film score writing , but zimmer 's only good work is pirates , and he did n't even do the themes for it ( i.e. , it was n't even one of his ghost writers : it was another public name ) . 
  just so you know , even without this , if it pops up in the chat box , but you do n't click inside the chat box , it wo n't register as `` seen '' . 
  hmm , perhaps it was . 
  i had always thought it was the other way around . 
  in that case , i 'll hand it to him , that 's pretty good . 
  still holds nothing on the dozens of williams scores or on shore 's work in middle-earth .

  there 's debate over whether the sarranids or swadians are best cavalry . 
  presenting it as `` swadians have the best ... followed by sarranids '' , as he did , is a bit disingenuous . 
  same :(, 
  ca n't watch got until wednesday evening !, 
  so not same class . 
  aye , but cheaper ones go for cheaper , and even more expensive ones are cheaper than raising and keeping a horse . 
  if so , it must be recent .

  people on mobile are going to hate you for that . 
  people do plenty of things that they do n't want others to find out about that are n't in any way illegal . 
  have you got any habits or tastes for things that you enjoy that might be considered embarrassing ? 
  i suspect you do , but even if you personally do n't plenty of people do . 
  and they do n't want those things getting out . 
  why should the government , for example , be allowed to know about the affair you 're having , or your furry porn fetish ?
