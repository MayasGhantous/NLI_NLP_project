  a technical mastery would mean you can play music , just that you would sound like a robot playing it . 
  my point is that you could then * learn * the musicality , which is much easier to do if you already have technical mastery than if you do n't . 
  similarly , a mastery of multiple languages makes it much easier to deliver an impressive speech in those languages than if you 're only learning them . 
   greens ', 
  i hate to be a dick and usually avoid correcting , but in this case i was legitimately stumped for a while , not realising you were talking about the possessive . 
  i thought it was `` the greens [ are ] work [ ing ] on this issue '' ( i.e. , work used as a verb ) . 
  but i agree entirely , they do n't get nearly enough attention from the media . 
  not that it 's surprising considering how far along the liberal bandwagon they are . 
  curious , what sort of things get posted in / r/frugal that are n't applicable here ? 
   that would be good , but the greens withdrew preference for labor , so i do n't think they 'd be wanting to join them any time soon . 
  but let 's be honest , in the ( unlikely ) event of another hung parliament where the greens have a seat , the greens are going to prefer labor over the liberals . 
  speaking of which , does anyone else think it 's high time we followed nz 's footsteps and removed our 5c coin ? 
   being a part of the commonwealth, 
  we 'd still be in the commonwealth if we became a republic . 
  just like india is today . 
  are you kidding ? 
  if you read it as the bound constant it sounds perfect . 
  you just need to come up with something worth naming . 
  i 'd actually like to point out that if you make a how-to on something that people want to know about you can get heaps of views . 
  i had a good way of using content aware fill on photoshop to make panoramas , and was surprised that i could n't find any video tutorials of other people using this technique ( at the time -- there 're heaps up now ) , and even as shitty and embarrassing as my delivery is , i 've managed to get over 25,000 views to date ( and consistently growing ) . 
  just because it was a how to that actually filled a requirement and was n't the 41st video on how to use the clone tool . 
  like google 's new [ webp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webp ) ? 
  lossy and lossless . 
  competes with jpeg for quality . 
  much smaller file sizes then jpeg . 
  alpha channels/transparency . 
  animation . 
  sorry i was unclear . 
  it would require a hung parliament at the next election . 
  that 's the bit i thought unlikely . 
  no , you 're absolutely right . 
  korea was the first and , until this one , the only war fought by the un . 
  people elsewhere in this thread are trying to argue semantics about how it was n't really the un , but that 's all really irrelevant . 
  the korean war was fought under the united nations command . 
  there 's a un cemetery in busan -- the only one in the world . 
  uhh ... would n't it make far * more * sense that the term comes from the korean word for their * own * country ? 
  \ud55c\uad6d ( hangug ) , hence they are `` gooks '' . 
  that 's a poor argument . 
  not everyone can always afford to pay . 
  it 's the same reason education , healthcare , and infrastructure need to be subsidised by governments . 
  someone who ca n't afford large fees on a yearly basis to renew their license , and yet is perfectly capable of driving , should n't be put further out of their way in order to keep driving . 
  you 're right on a technicality there ( the best kind of right !, 
  ) , but in practice i do n't think it 's unreasonable to discount a lnp coalition when talking about a hung parliament . 
  but indeed i was emphasising * next * , so the point is moot . 
  wow , seriously ? 
  fuck you . 
  it does n't matter who you are or who they are . 
  local , tourist , fucking alien . 
  letting your kids run amok annoying others makes you a bad person and a bad parent . 
  not to the extent that they are annoying others in a physical way . 
  making lots of noise , running around , etc. 
  is fine ; throwing stuff such that it hits someone else , or flinging up sand such that it gets on other people , is not . 
  is n't a [ master of engineering science ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=5528 ) a 1-year programme ? 
  i honestly do n't know much at all about how it works , but it * seems * to be . 
  then the locals in your area are dicks . 
  and your assumption that this mum is doing it in a `` houghty [ sic ] rude tourist tone '' is a completely unfair one , made without any basis whatsoever . 
  +1 for lastpass . 
  absolutely awesome , i ca n't live without it . 
  never heard of mighttext before , but [ after looking it up ] ( http://mightytext.net/ ) ( link for the lazy , also key features for the really lazy below ) it looks awesome !, 
  definitely gon na give it a go .

  [ turn off the lights ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turn-off-the-lights/bfbmjmiodbnnpllbbbfblcplfjjepjdn?hl=en ) turns the background on youtube ( and a few other sites ) dark , making it easier to see the main content .

  i can confirm it does work in the beta version , but i do n't know if it will on stable yet . 
  even so , the argument i 'm presenting is a more general one . 
  the idea of whether or not the kids should be allowed to behave like they did . 
  if the person above was rude when telling the parent to control them , then that person is in the wrong . 
  however , it does n't change the fact that the parent and the kids are * also * in the wrong behaving how they were , annoying others . 
  ooo yes !, 
  many people talk about things like siege weapons , which i agree would be awesome , but would probably feel out of place in the game . 
  but opening the gates as a defender to let out cavalry , or the ability to knock it open with a battering ram ( which would work similarly to how current siege towers work , only would take a few hits after arriving before knocking it open ) would be really cool and should n't be too out of place . 
  as for a saboteur , i like the idea , but what sort of things do you have in mind that one could do with it ? 
  and some wagner , and do n't forget stravinsky . 
  edit : oh , and the start of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo1khr-b-ca ) is strangely similar to a certain famous shark theme ... 
  no , you 're confusing beethoven with bach and the baroque era . 
  bach 's death is often considered to mark the end of the baroque era . 
  the classical era is considered `` over '' with beethoven 's eroica ( his symphony no . 
  so most of his more well known pieces , particularly the orchestral ones , are in the romantic era by classification . 
  yeah , eroica is generally classified as the beginning of the romantic era . 
  i actually do n't study music : never went past secondary school . 
  but you 're right that the borderline of the eras is not a hard and fast one . 
  however , much like bach 's death is often regarded as the end of the baroque era ( despite some pieces written before that date having more in common with , say , mozart than some pieces written after it ) , the eroica symphony is what is most often stated -- when anything specific is used -- as the beginning of the romantic era , despite some earlier pieces ( for example those exhibiting the traits of `` sturm und drang '' ) being arguably more `` romantic '' than some of those that came after ( such as the aforementioned 8th symphony ) . 
  the source : leonard bernstein 's `` the infinite variety of music '', 
  or , for a quicker read , the wikipedia article on that symphony https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._3_ ( beethoven ) ( ca n't hot link because reddit markup does n't like brackets within urls ) . 
  edit : but further , i think that if one looks at that work in particular , the harmonic qualities of it , the immense expressivity . 
  and then also takes into account its political background : an important aspect in romantic-era music , far more so than in the classical era , one must inevitably arrive at the conclusion that eroica has far more in common with the romantic era than the classical . 
  oooo , i really like the way you worded it in your tl ; dr. 
  that is , in fact , how bernstein words it . 
  i believe i may have been applying it in a less tentative way than it was intended . 
  edit : not a fan of your argumentum ad auctoritatem , though . 
  bernstein , in addition to being a great conductor and composer , really * was * an intelligent musicologist ( albeit one who was headstrong in his interpretations , for lack of a better wording ) , and his opinion is most certainly worth considering when debating a point . 
  the fact that he is also popular has no more bearing on his intelligence than the fact that stephen hawking 's popularity has on his . 
  i did n't realise i was in / r/elitistclassical, 
  i jest , but in all seriousness , those `` layman '' pieces are well known and popular for a reason , and that is that they really are incredible pieces .
