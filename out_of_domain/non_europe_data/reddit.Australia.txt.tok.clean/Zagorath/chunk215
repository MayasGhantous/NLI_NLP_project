  can you really listen to clair de lune , the first movement of beethoven 's piano sonata in c # minor , chopin 's nocturnes , mozart 's concertos ( in particular the clarinet ) , satie 's gymnop\u00e9dies , or `` air on a g string '' , and say those are n't among the most beautiful pieces ? 
  sure , we 've all heard them to to death , but they 're still amazing pieces of music , and famous for a very particular reason . 
  still , my answer to the question would have to be [ elgar 's cello concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=681nvqpo2eu ) . 
  a fairly well known one , but not * quite * to the same degree as the above . 
  i want to submit to / r/nottheonion , but i feel they would n't appreciate the details of australian politics . 
  indeed . 
  what may be particularly relevant here is that they are n't behind the great firewall of china . 
  you can access facebook and youtube from hong kong . 
  your use of fps there confused the hell out of me . 
  was n't until i saw / u/m4d _ g0d_c4o5e7h 's reply to it that i realised you meant frames per second and not first person shooter ... 
  wait , is the actor who plays loki left handed ? 
  yeah , top comment talked about how amazing this brand is for lasting two seasons . 
  it confused me since i do n't think i 've ever really heard about people needing to regularly replace their whipper snippers . 
  i agree with you in general , and i strongly doubt many people will disagree . 
  however , in order to follow rule one , i 'll point out things that may convince some people to buy an xbox one over a ps4 . 
  * exclusives, 
  some people may prefer the games that are exclusive to the xbone over those that are exclusive to the ps4 . 
  personally i think those people are crazy , but they 're entitled to that opinion . 
  * friends, 
  if their friends are getting xbones , and they want to be able to play online games with their friends , they 'll have to get an xbone themselves . 
  similar to how google + is better than facebook on nearly every front , but people still use facebook because their friends are on it . 
  * controller, 
  it seems to be the opinion of the vast majority of gamers , at least from what i 've seen on / r/gaming , / r/games , and comment threads on youtube , that the xbox controller is better than the sony dualshock . 
  i * strongly * disagree with them -- to me it feels like you have to contort your hand to use -- but most people do prefer the xbox . 
  for that reason , they may be more willing to get the xbox just for that . 
  * kinect, 
  many people like to hate on it , but it 's vastly superior to the stuff sony has with its move . 
  i do n't know who would care about this feature , or what they would use it for exactly , but there are sure to be some people who would . 
  haha yeah . 
  it 's actually a really good subreddit . 
  the title `` elitist '' is just a joke , and it 's just about sharing somewhat more obscure pieces . 
  they 're really friendly and interesting . 
  / r/outside, 
  the `` scientist '' clan . 
  they 're really strict on who can get in , you have to have a high amount of int . 
  i learnt this stuff in primary school ... like , year 3 or something . 
  but then , i learnt far more out of my own personal interest . 
  that , and age of mythology . 
  best solution , create a new ` instrument ' ( press ` i ' , add a new one ) , triple click on one of the hands , ctrl/command + x to cut it , select the correct hand of the new , blank , instrument , ctrl/command + v to paste . 
  then repeat for the other hand . 
  as far as i can tell , it 's not a feature that currently exists . 
  i know i do n't get syncing of this sort between chrome on my mac and chrome on my nexus 4 , and as far as i can tell safari mac -  safari ios does n't do it either . 
  regarding reddit specifically , you can use res to hide links you 've already * voted * on , so if you get into the habit of voting on everything you 've seen , then they will not appear on your computer after having voted for them on your ipad . 
  alternatively , you could use the voted arrow as an indication that you 've already seen it , without hiding the post entirely . 
  an awkward workaround , but should achieve the desired result . 
  if it 's that new , and you bought a legit one , take it back to apple . 
  their support teams are amazing ( part of the reason they get away with charing so much for the computer ) , and they should replace it for you without charge . 
  huh ... i guess i 'm one of those morons . 
  i do n't actually currently have * any * backup solution ( i know ... i know ... ) , but i had always considered raid as one potential option as a backup . 
  assuming raid 1 , where every bit is on each drive , how is that any different from , say , a time machine backup , except with the added advantage of faster read times ? 
  or raid 5 , which gives you the safety net of a single drive dying ? 
  so , how is raid not a good backup solution ? 
  edit :, 
   many things that can wipe out one drive can just as easily wipe them all at once . 
  what are these ? 
  obviously theft and natural disasters , but regarding those , a hard drive sitting on your desk constantly plugged in backing up automatically through something like time machine has that fault . 
  what sort of issues would these raid configurations have that a single hard drive on your desk would n't have ? 
  curious , where are you ? 
  what keyboard do you have that has a '' \u00a7 '' key ? 
  i believe it 's more just to do with switzerland 's neutral stance on everything . 
  they did n't even join the un as a full member until 2002 . 
  the guys at / r/lounge would love that gold coloured one . 
  why 1963 ? 
  i assume you 're looking for music in the public domain , but 1963 is n't the cutoff for that * anywhere * that i know of . 
  usually it 's based on `` life plus 50 '' or `` life plus 70 '' , depending on your area . 
  that would mean you do n't want something * recorded * before ' 63 , but something recorded by someone who * died * before then . 
  * very * different . 
  in any case , it 's going to be difficult to find . 
  you would be better off searching for a creative commons licensed recording , or possibly paying for a royalty free version ( one that gives you the licence to use it without having to pay ongoing royalties ) . 
  alternatively , you could write out the score in something like sibelius , and use the electronic exported version of the piece from that . 
  edit : unfortunately the rights are unclear , but [ this version from archive.org ] ( http://archive.org/details/holst-theplanets ) seems as though it is cc licensed . 
  depending on how important it is to you to have music you can use the rights to , this may be suitable . 
  this is perfect . 
  i could n't previously decide whether it was better to do / u/kimmers87 's idea or / u/ungreat 's , because kimmers ' gives you the satisfaction of showing him up directly , while ungreat 's has the satisfaction of giving someone else your money , not them . 
  your idea is the best of both worlds . 
  [ perhaps the worst violation in this way i 've ever seen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyphwlsfhyw&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  they do n't make these anymore . . ? 
  i 've never seen or heard of these before , but holy hell they look amazing !, 
  i would so buy them if they made them today . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with him about syndrome , but sid definitely was n't a villain . 
  an antagonist , sure , but not a villain ( as per the definition described above ) . 
  i 've read the first book and seen that awful movie , and this felt * a lot * like douglas adams ' writing style . 
  holy shit are you serious ? 
  i ~ ~ found ~ ~ could have sworn that was something from douglas adams ' writing . 
  it read exactly like the guide . 
  enormously well done to you , sir .

  the missing comma is n't an oxford comma . 
  oxford commas , also known as serial commas , are used before `` and '' or `` or '' in a list of three or more possibilities . 
  for example : i have to buy apples , oranges , and pears . 
  the comma after `` oranges '' is the oxford comma . 
  this sentence needs a comma after `` memories we shared '' , to separate it from the idea of boning ( bonding ) with teachers . 
  edit : [ i dun woosh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_i1xk07o4g ), 
  vampire weekend ? 
  ah , right . 
  cheers . 
  dude , if you could get your dell or asus or whatever laptop signed by bill gates , would you do it ?
