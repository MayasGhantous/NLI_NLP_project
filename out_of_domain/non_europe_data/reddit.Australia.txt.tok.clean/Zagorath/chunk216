  i sure would . 
  heck , i 'd get gates to sign my macbook if i got the chance . 
  the woz is just like that : he 's a huge celebrity in the tech world , and an incredibly nice man to boot . 
   we 're better than average at stopping dickheads from getting too far here, 
  come back and say that again on september 15th ... 
  our apple store ? 
  what , the one inside chermside ? 
  or one of the other ones inside a shopping centre ? 
  as far as i 'm aware , we do n't even have a * proper * apple store \u00e0 la sydney or new york . 
  lesser of two evils . 
  try disabling adblock , see if that works . 
  i can definitely see why google would want to move against people using that ... 
  sampling bias, 
  fair enough , that 's fine for you . 
  but many people think differently . 
  the user i replied to was getting ants in his pants about specifically apple users wanting their laptops signed and how that 's unusual . 
  i do n't think they 've ever officially mentioned this , but to me it would n't make sense to have an assassin from eastern asia . 
  at least , not one that is an ancestor of desmond . 
  the transition from middle east to europe to the americas makes sense , but the transition to this asia within that is less likely and less believable . 
  while i agree with both you and op , you are in violation of rule 1 . 
   and all you want to do is making a man hitting a women be 5, 
  that 's not how i interpreted it . 
  i interpreted it as we should make a `` man hitting a woman be the same as a man hitting a man or a woman hitting a man '' . 
  no specific value . 
  however , op 's inclusion of, 
   i think we should rather teach ` violence is wrong ', 
  makes me think that the ` value ' assigned to it would be on the higher end of the spectrum . 
   i 'm going to assume you 're an adolescent , and still finding your way , because no man ought to this . 
  mmm ... love that ad hominem . 
  the oxford dictionary of english lists it as :, 
   an item of unreliable information that is reported and repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact, 
  am i missing something ? 
  the entire omnibus series is absolutely incredible . 
  beethoven , conducting , opera , bach , jazz , modern music , and musical comedy . 
  if you can get your hands on all 7 on them through * any * means , i strongly recommend you do . 
  am i the only one confused at the concept of a bank inside a grocery store ? 
  how does this violate rule 1 ? 
  it clearly challenges part of op 's view . 
  it 's not aiming for a complete 180 \u02da , but it clearly is attempting to change what the commenter interpreted as op 's view . 
  even more so , the australian sex party should change their name , because it makes them sound like a joke when they actually have some serious policies . 
  the key point of libertarianism ( as a movement ) is that it 's both economic * and * social . 
  right wing economics is , fundamentally , the belief that the free market ( `` private enterprise '' , as you put it ) will fix things if left to its own devices . 
  as opposed to left wing economics , which believes the free market will inevitably result in inefficiencies that need a central government to fix . 
  the liberal party is , at least nominally , right wing on economics , but fundamentally * not * libertarian , because they 're not in support of freedom socially . 
  to place them on the [ political compass ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) , the `` libertarian '' movement would be in the bottom right quadrant . 
  `` libertarian '' on social issues , but right wing economics . 
  the liberals would be top right , authoritarian on social issues and right wing economics , while the greens are bottom left , libertarian on social issues but left wing economics . 
  mmm ... dat vertical video . 
  none of the booklets i found in googling had a topic 8 . 
  that 's two from 2006 and two for people doing exams next year ( 2014 ) . 
  i agree , but the important question is ** how ** ? 
  with your current set up , where the president is chosen by a first past the post mechanism , there 's nothing that can be done . 
  two party is n't a mindset , it 's the inevitable result of only being able to vote for a single party . 
  see [ this excellent video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo ) for a more detailed explanation of why that is . 
  so the question is how would propose fixing it ? 
  the most obvious solution would be instant-runoff within each state , and have the electoral college work as it currently does , but it 's far from a simple change . 
  that 's not sl , it 's studies . 
  haha no worries . 
  i assume you 're talking here specifically about the united states ? 
  i would say that your claim regarding education is not correct on a worldwide scale , as many other education systems are far less reliant on shoving facts down students ' throats . 
  fair point, 
  i went through the international baccalaureate programme , which is incredible in how it encourages students ' abilities to learn for themselves , teaching critical thinking etc. 
  i do n't know much about them , but i 've heard nothing but good things about the education systems of many scandinavian countries as well . 
  i think the only thing more original than the comment you replied to is your own comment about how original his comment was . 
  i kind of agree with / u/cronidollars . 
  i hope you do n't mean you 're the kind of person that will go nuts over someone else uploading a photo that they took , which happens to have your kids in it , on facebook . 
  my spades are all shovels . 
  my understanding -- and take this with a grain of salt , it 's entirely gathered from tv , movies , and the internet , not actual experience -- is that the american system has an intense focus on memorising facts specifically for exams . 
  it does n't teach reasoning skills or even understanding of concepts , but just rote learning . 
  that 's what makes it inferior to the ib , and probably many other systems . 
  it 's still better than systems like that which you described in india ( vietnam is another one , from what little i gathered while i lived there ) , but inferior to one that does encourage these deeper understanding skills . 
  again , my base assumptions could be misinformed , which would render my argument moot . 
  fair enough then . 
  aww man i loved that show as a kid !, 
  wanted to be a palaeontologist when i was little , and it 's probably at least partly because of this show . 
  also , kenneth branagh 's narration is amazing . 
  this was brought up recently on / r/changemyview . 
  you should [ take a look ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ghai7/i_believe_that_cyclists_should_be_forced_to_wear/ ) . 
  there were some very convincing reasons against this . 
  thanks a heap . 
  i was a little worried about it myself , though i suspected this would be the case . 
  man , gog seems absolutely awesome !, 
  the two are not exactly closely related or essential to each other , thus it is not necessary to play the first game . 
  but after all , it 's cheap not bad at all , i would recommend picking up the witcher 1 if you have a chance to . 
  hey !, 
  also got a 9800gt , and definitely also starting to feel the strain . 
  just curious , have you put any thought into when you might upgrade , and what to ? 
  also just for nerdish interest , what processor are you running ? 
  is 4 still deeper with its expansions ? 
  the previous one added back spies and religion , and the one about to come out will add cultural victories , `` world congress '' , and international trade . 
  i never played civ 4 ( went straight from civ 2 : test of time to civ 5 ) , but from what i 've read those were most of the things missing . 
  i could be wrong , though . 
  pretty sure most people agree with you on that one . 
  i personally always preferred mythology , though ( still waiting for an hd release of that !, 
  you 'll be glad to know it 's now at the top . 
  i noticed this and used it when downloading torchlight . 
  absolutely awesome !, 
  so much better than the giant bloat that is steam . 
  additionally :, 
   i wanted to stay a democracy , but the senate would always over-rule me when i wanted to declare war before the vikings did ... i was ** forced ** to do away with democracy roughly a thousand years ago because it was endangering my empire .
