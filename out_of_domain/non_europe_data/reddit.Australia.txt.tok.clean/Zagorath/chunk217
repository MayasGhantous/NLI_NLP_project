  ( emphasis mine ), 
  it is truly sad how the mighty have fallen . 
  yeah sure there 's that , but there 's also most keyboard shortcuts ( as / u/miggyb said ) and notetaking/writing with pen and paper . 
  being left handed and using a mouse in your write hand is awesome !, 
  oh come on . 
  that 's only if you subscribe to this ridiculous notion of taxes being equivalent to holding a gun to someone 's head and robbing them . 
  there 's a huge difference between taxation to create a better society and robbing someone to make things nicer for yourself . 
   given australia 's proximity to the asian countries , it is indubitably profiting off of the wealth influx to that hemisphere . 
  i 'd just like to slightly alter that statement . 
  it 's not so much proximity ( though that probably does play a part ) as our resources . 
  australia is the world 's [ largest exporter of coal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal#major_coal_exporters ) , and all of the top 5 importers are in asia . 
  we 're also the [ largest exporter of iron ore ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-20/australia-increases-2013-iron-ore-price-estimate-on-china-demand.html ) , with china the leading importer ( interestingly , that 's despite china also being [ the largest * producer * by a large margin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_iron_ore_production ) . 
  no , the reason you 're stuck in a two party system is * not * because voters do n't believe anyone else has a chance . 
  it 's a flaw of the first past the post voting system and you will inevitably end up with a two -- or * maybe * three if you 're lucky -- party system unless you change to a proportional or preferential voting system . 
  but every person who votes for a third party is taking a vote away from the lesser of two evils . 
  by voting for johnson , you are helping the member of the larger party you * disagree with most * to get in . 
  you 're missing * his * point . 
  teachers can easily say `` okay class , what i just taught you actually is n't quite accurate , and if you study this subject further , you 'll learn a more accurate way of doing things , but for now this is close enough '' . 
  i 've had teachers who did this , and i 've always greatly appreciated when they did . 
  it 's not hard , and not doing so is simply patronising to the children . 
  you actually missed one !, 
  there 's also a plant of the genus ` stylidium ' that is known as daddy long legs . 
  i learnt it growing up ( probably from parents , or tv , but might have been in school ) as something that is a common misconception . 
  personally i prefer calling the americas two continents , and afro-eurasia two continents ( africa and eurasia ) . 
  i 'm still undecided on whether antarctica should count or not , and thus whether i subscribe to a 5 or 6 continent model ... 
  pretty sure the day we hit the 21st month the world will have ended . 
  [ sorry , i could n't resist ... ], 
  he discovered it in the same way cook discovered australia . 
  he was the first one there ... apart from all the others . 
  wait ... why the hell were you not taught that multiplying by zero is zero initially ? 
  that 's super easy to do . 
  and holy what . 
  you learnt complex numbers in grade 7 ? 
  i did n't get to them until year 11 or 12 ( of a 13 year system ) . 
  and what do you mean by doing maths on things that are n't numbers ? 
  that sounds either incredibly obvious ( hello basic algebra ) or incredibly confusing . 
  australian here . 
  was definitely taught about the antarctic ocean as a kid . 
  i loved peter and the starcatchers !, 
  but , series ? 
  i only read a single book , by the name of `` peter and the starcatchers '' . 
  what were the grounds for disney not giving the money from that book ( and the apparent sequels to it ) ? 
  the wikipedia article does n't go into detail . 
  i 'm curious , what sort of things were the questions about ? 
  is there anywhere we could see sample papers online ? 
  hope you 've seen his standup . 
  it 's incredible !,

  wait reeve did an ama ? 
  link ? 
  reddit does n't count multiple upvotes from the same ip address . 
  oh come on , that 's going a bit too far . 
  remember , any business is run by real people . 
  real people who have their own set of moral values and ethics . 
  particularly in smaller businesses , this can show through to their business practices . 
  especially when it 's something that 's revenue neutral or only slightly positive . 
  i do n't know if they 're related , but kmart is still big in australia . 
  edit : did a quick search , and apparently it used to be related , but has since been bought out and is not related to the american kmart . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kmart#canada.2c_europe.2c_mexico_and_australia_stores ), 
  haha awesome , thanks !, 
  exactly what i was looking for . 
  it 's not nearly as black and white ( or black , white , and exactly one shade of grey ) as you make out . 
  sure , steve jobs and many other rich people got where they are through some amount of lying and stealing , but he was also imparted no small amount of luck , and he had a great amount of talent as well . 
  not that any of this is really relevant to my point that * some * businesses make * some * decisions * in part * on the basis of morals . 
  not all businesses , and not all decisions , and not huge ones that would leave them with massive deficits , but some things are affected by their morals . 
  that 's true , and i would n't rely on a company like microsoft to be ethical for the sake of ethics . 
  however , that does n't mean, 
  a ) large companies ca n't be ethical in order to build good will from customers and thus make more money . 
  who cares that their reasons are n't entirely altruistic , they 're still doing something right . 
  b ) * smaller * companies ca n't sometimes be ethical just for the sake of it , because they 're less beholden to large groups of people . 
  cool , thanks . 
  since posting that i 've also looked into it myself a bit , and it seems there are some specific things missing , like the detailed level of civics in civ iv , vs more limited culture trees + religion ( in expansion 1 ) + that choice of three ideologies ( in expansion 2 ) . 
  if you do n't mind , how does espionage work in civ 4 ? 
  the [ wiki ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/espionage_ ( civ4 \\ ) ) was almost useless . 
  and is there any equivalent to civ v 's '' [ world congress ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/world_congress_\\ ( civ5 \\ ) ) '' ( in expansion 2 ) . 
  and i have to say , i think i prefer the way religion is handled in civ v , just based on what i 've read . 
  that particular aspect seems much more detailed and flexible . 
  overall , i 'm quite torn really ... both seem to have a number of advantages, 
  who man , that 's a thing !? 
  you should post it as a direct reply to this op , because that 's really cool . 
  i 'm guessing you 're really excited for mavericks , then ? 
  edit : ( by which i mean for better use of the multiple displays you already have -- it wo n't allow you to add more , obviously . ), 
  dammit now i do , too . 
  if it was just any random film , but made in black and white , probably not -- although i would n't have anything particular * against * seeing it , either . 
  however , if i had reason to believe the cinematographer went to special efforts to gain the most out of the black and white format , and the story was also decent , then yeah , i would definitely see it . 
  yes , jobs was n't an innovator . 
  and he was n't a revolutionary . 
  what he was , was a visionary . 
  he took things that already existed , and he had the vision to make them successful . 
  he was n't the one that implimented that vision , but he had the ability to find people ( wozniak , ives , etc. ), 
  and work with them to create the products in his vision . 
  think of all the impact the technologies of popular personal computers , smartphones , and tablets have had on society . 
  we now have access to almost all of the world 's knowledge in the palm of our hands , from nearly anywhere in the developed world . 
  that is in no small part because of steve jobs ' vision and the immense quality he demanded . 
  even if you never use an apple product , if you 're using windows on your computer or android on your smartphone/tablet , you owe a big part of that experience to apple and by extension jobs . 
  no , for a while apple was the biggest company in the world , using market capital as the metric . 
  the took the title briefly in mid-late 2011 , before being the largest by a large margin for almost all of 2012 , before losing the title again earlier this year .
