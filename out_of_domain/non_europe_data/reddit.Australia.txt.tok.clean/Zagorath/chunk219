  i found this bbc series of three hour-long documentaries/mockumentaries/dramas on reddit a while back , and only recently got round to watching them . 
  they 're absolutely incredible . 
  [ part 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yued9vb51hk ), 
  [ part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsgabl7kmi ), 
  [ part 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uujw0adfqly ), 
  i 've been watching [ this guy 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcq6skmzzau&amp;list=sp4vbgurud_hqf20wkn3yfiv4ws2ljv61t ) playthrough ( link to playlist on the 13th episode of 36 ) . 
  no talking * anywhere * , and as far as i can tell he 's not missing any details of the game ( like those mentioned by / u/dubesor86 ), 
  edit : [ link to the first episode , because it 's better that way ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auz3mkvujx8&amp;feature=share&amp;list=sp4vbgurud_hqf20wkn3yfiv4ws2ljv61t ), 
  i just do n't understand multiplayer . 
  hmm ... that 's really interesting , but i do wonder how applicable it is . 
  the graph shown only has `` spoilers '' and `` no spoilers '' and yet they described a third case : spoilers * embedded * within the story . 
  a real world example of that would be shakespeare 's romeo and juliet , where the prelude tells you what happens . 
  secondly , how is the enjoyment in that graph measured ? 
  the article does n't even touch on it . 
  is it people giving a rating out of 100 ( or any other arbitrary number ) during the book ? 
  after reading the whole book ? 
  or perhaps a weighting of both ? 
  or is it something completely different ? 
  as david mitchell describes in his rant about [ living in the moment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htt6qjqzxk ) , your overall enjoyment of something in the moment can be completely different to your enjoyment after the fact , when you have the context of the end result ( around 1:25 -- 3:02 ) . 
  now , this obviously is n't a scholarly article like your original link , but its points seem perfectly valid to me , and it does call into question how applicable the results of the above study are . 
  if he was really frustrated with it , you can turn that feature off . 
  i do n't have a ps3 , and i 'm just watching a play-through on youtube . 
  [ this one here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auz3mkvujx8&amp;feature=share&amp;list=sp4vbgurud_hqf20wkn3yfiv4ws2ljv61t ) is incredible . 
  none of the annoying talking , he gives attention to all the details of the story ( clicks on all the optional conversations etc. ) . 
  i wish i could play the game , but because of the linear nature of the story in this game watching these videos is just like watching a really long movie with bad visuals and an awesome story . 
  comment has an asterisk next to it . 
  i assume he edited out the spoiler . 
  the news said 9:30 is its largest . 
  you support them blocking an entire site on [ incredibly flimsy evidence ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/caobike ) ( see / u/please _ pass_the_milk 's comments in that thread ) and communicating this change ( none of the official channels : / r/blog , / r/changelog , / r/announcements have mentioned this ) to users ? 
  where 's the evidence that it 's banned site-wide ? 
  [ this comment here is pretty much my feeling right now ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/caocinz ), 
  [ not to mention , the evidence against it seems * incredibly * scarce ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/caobike ) ( particularly see / u/please _ pass_the_milk 's comments in that thread ), 
  sorry , posting here just because it 's smaller and much more likely to actually be seen than in the giant mess of / r/adviceanimals . 
  honestly this change seems like a * really * bad idea . 
  hardly any evidence , poorly communicated ( the admins have n't announced it ... ) , and far too heavy-handed . 
  devil 's advocate here ( i fully disagree with op ) , but there is a difference . 
  assange and manning release everything without discrimination . 
  snowden went through and carefully only released information that was pertinent and which did n't put anyone in undue danger . 
  is it not a part of virtually all common law systems that the accused is assumed innocent until * proven * otherwise ? 
   it has been announced as such, 
  where ? 
  that adviceanimals link seems to be the closest it gets to official , and i did n't see a single comment marked with the red of an admin , and it has n't had any mention in / r/blog , / r/announcements , or / r/changelog . 
  i understand that it * is * site-wide , but my point is it has n't been communicated as such . 
  not to mention that this seems incredibly hasty . 
  given reddit 's historical emphasis on freedom of speech and its reluctance to ban anything , it seems a terrible change of face in light of an incredibly small amount of fairly circumstantial evidence . 
  ( by the way , your correct use of effect as a verb makes me way happier than it should ), 
   knowing the ending can allow you to obtain enjoyment from other aspects of the story that one might not have original paid attention to, 
  yeah definitely , that 's definitely true . 
  i love reading back through something after knowing the end and seeing all the clues along the way . 
  the article itself puts it best :, 
   in all these types of stories , spoilers may allow readers to organize developments , anticipate the implications of events , and resolve ambiguities that occur in the course of reading . 
  your abridging of the results seems to contradict my interpretation of the article . 
   indeed , it was only spoilers external to the stories that enhanced readers ' delight ; there was no benefit to our editing the stories themselves . 
  to me , that seems to say that including spoilers within the story ( like romeo and juliet , or stranger than faction as you explained it ) is the same as not including spoilers at all , with external spoilers being the only ones to have an effect . 
  but anyway , this was a really interesting read , i 'm really glad you shared it . 
  personally , though , i still intend to do everything that i can to avoid spoilers . 
  i 'd ideally like to experience the story in the way the author originally intended . 
  to me , their artistic vision is more important than my own enjoyment . 
  and then maybe read it again to get those extra details . 
  haha awesome job !, 
  the first megafield i ever saw was the old blue one over perth , so way-to-go reversing that . 
  i 'm really not enjoying the way brisbane looks on that map at the moment ... 
  in my opinion , blocking advertising is * worse * than piracy . 
  ignoring cases where piracy is done simply because it 's easier ( lets you do what * you * want with the files ) , it 's getting something without paying , where the other option is paying money over to the creator . 
  that 's money that you will no longer have , and so you would be somewhat worse off for it . 
  blocking ads is the same , except that you * would n't be handing over money anyway * . 
  you 're removing a monetary source for someone who is giving content to you * for free anyway * . 
  i 've just completed my first semester of a software engineering programme . 
  my courses ( ` subjects ' ) for this semester included one dedicated to learning programming , and second one that involved using programming but which was not taught . 
  the former one taught python . 
  the reason they chose it for their first-year course is because it 's an incredibly simple introduction into object-oriented programming . 
  the other course involved programming for an arduino , which uses an adapted form of the c language , i believe . 
  despite no formal training in it , i was able to extrapolate from a few included sample code files , as well as my knowledge of python from the other course to [ do what i needed with the arduino ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr1utt7arl4 ) . 
  honestly , you can probably start with any oo language and it should n't be too hard to then switch to another when you need , you just need to learn their respective syntaxes . 
  from what i 've seen , though , python seems as though it 's probably an easier one to get the hang of than c or java . 
  my experience has n't been very extensive , though , so take that with a grain of salt . 
  your other comments say you 're considering doing computer science . 
  from what i can tell , it 's nearly the same thing as software engineering , so i hope you enjoy it !, 
  i 'd like to see a higher quality version just because i kinda want to add this to my folder of wallpapers , but imgur 's compression ( plus the one you added ) are n't great for that . 
  how fast was the car going ? 
  i 'm amazed that 1/200th did n't get * any * motion blur in the background . 
  also out of interest , what 's the camera ? 
  some reflectors to get more light on her , and a better sensor to avoid the noise and this would 've been a great photo . 
  op never said anything like that . 
  they implied that * nobody they know * swears as much as ellie . 
  you mention dark cloud 2 , but not the original game ? 
  man , that was one of my favourite games as a kid . 
  never managed to finish it , though ... one day i 'll go back and beat the dark genie . 
  it 's a game . 
  compared to any animation or live action film , yeah , bad visuals . 
  especially when you add in youtube 's awful compression . 
  as a game , of course , the visuals are amazing , but i 'm not playing it as a game . 
   oh , and gillard went back on her claim that there would be no carbon tax almost as soon as she was re-elected, 
  except , of course , that she did n't . 
  she 's always said there would be no carbon tax , but there would be a price on carbon , and that 's exactly what we 've got with the current introductory phase of an ets . 
  mmm yeah , definitely * much * better . 
  but yeah , i suspected it may be a crop-sensor camera . 
  it was n't nearly wide enough to be 18 mm on a full-frame . 
  must say i 'm a little jealous , though . 
  my camera 's only a d3100 .
