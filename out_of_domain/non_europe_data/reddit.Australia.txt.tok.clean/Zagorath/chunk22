  of course , what one chooses to buy for gaming is entirely their own choice , but let 's be honest , most serious gamers do n't choose their platform based on price , but on which they prefer the feel of . 
  what if we have two computers that we use fairly equally ? 
  i have a windows desktop and a mac laptop ... 
  no , not incorrect . 
  at least , if it is , not on those grounds . 
  i was simply saying that the perceived value of a console is affected for * most * consumers more by their preferences , and not in the actual cost . 
  that statement is debatable , but the logic behind it is not . 
  if it were that close , what other effects would we see ? 
  how much would the tides change ( in qualitative terms ) , and how much bigger would it appear in the sky ? 
  to be fair , he was n't under oath when he declared war . 
  i thought oboe players could n't go out of tune ? 
  is n't that why we tune to them ? 
  i 'm not sure saying `` higher quality '' in this over / r/classicalmusic is really fair . 
  the music that everyone 's heard a hundred times has become heard so much largely because it 's good . 
  i still agree with the rest of your comment , about it being good music that many people wo n't have heard . 
  yes of course . 
  i definitely love this subreddit for that , and for the fact that it has really interesting music that i 've never heard before . 
  we already get enough `` that movie was too long `` s , and if they 'd included that it would have meant cutting out a bit of the saruman stuff they put in to replace it . 
  i just feel that it 's one of the most important bits of the entire story : it tells the entire point of the character development that the hobbits -- particularly pippin and merry -- went through during the story . 
  i would tend to agree with cfredrickson , the 3rd is probably the most revolutionary , followed by the 9th , and then perhaps the 5th ( although it was more influential than revolutionary , as he said ) . 
  with his 3rd symphony , beethoven ushered in the entire romantic period of music , and thus was a direct influence on mahler , wagner , and all our other favourite romantic composers . 
  how many clarinetists does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
  only one , but he 'll go through a whole box of bulbs before he finds just the right one . 
  yeah , the armenian duduk is such a beautiful instrument . 
  it 's a shame we have n't gotten to hear it in this show . 
  i 'm not a basketball fan , but i do n't think it would be like a lakers player and a kardashian . 
  paris hilton 's a good analogue for asami , because she 's the rich daughter of a famous businessman . 
  the fire ferrets , remember , are the rookie team . 
  an analogue for mako would be a player on one of the worst teams in the nba , not a top-level team ( like i believe the lakers are , but again i 'm not a basketball fan , so i could be wrong about that ) . 
  so , they * are * the evil ones !, 
  ^ sent ^ from ^ my ^ mac, 
  but the effects were decent . 
  i do n't think it 'd be children , though . 
  more the adult and late teen fans of the original series . 
  and katymcg is reading on the internet using my voice , ladies and gentlemen !, 
  i was expecting the scene where he runs past the firebenders on his way to get medicine . 
  there are five of them , so unless someone abstains ( which we have n't ever seen before ) there can never be a tie . 
  why would you spoil it for yourself like that ? 
  i 'd much rather do everything i can to avoid finding any details about the new episode until i watch it . 
  easy to do , though , considering most of them are complete puppets . 
  not to mention it seems rather odd that the water tribes get one each , whereas the fire and earth nation/kingdom , although they probably have a larger total population , get only one representative for the entire land . 
  ftfy, 
   slippery slope * fallacy *, 
  ftfy, 
  wow those things look disturbing . 
  but still , that is an incredible discovery . 
  i would venture to guess that choosing to move backwards rather than choosing a different head might be because it does n't have an arm directly behind it . 
  having 5 arms means that in order to go backwards it would have to choose a head that is 36 degrees away from directly behind , so moving backwards without changing head might help . 
  it 's pure speculation , of course , and i assume these biologists have considered something like this if it is remotely possible . 
  yeah , i did say that it seems something they will have already considered . 
  i think a typical reddit response at this point would be `` whoosh '' , but since that does n't help anyone :, 
  i was quoting the last airbender episode `` the ember island players '', 
  actually , i thought the visuals in cameron 's movie were * absolutely amazing * , but i agree the story-line was very lacking . 
  i did n't know that . 
  i do n't follow gossip all that closely , i guess ... 
  i love the title `` a long expected party '' , when you consider the hobbit 's `` an unexpected party '', 
  `` elongate '' is a word , maybe that 's what she was thinking of ? 
  oh , i do n't doubt that . 
  i just think that whatever caused her to believe the word was `` longinate '' was probably her misunderstanding someone else using the word `` elongate '', 
  hahaha , it could be worse though !, 
  you could be the percussionist !, 
  they likely wo n't even be playing at figure 85 . 
  edit : figure 85 , not bar 85 , whoops . 
  actually , it is . 
  if you look at the top , it says `` contrabass '', 
  but note , right before the basses come back in there are repeated changes between 6/8 and 9/8 . 
  if they just watch for that it should be easy to zone out while they rest . 
  not to mention after not too long they 'll just learn the music enough to know by ear when their entry is . 
  hahaha i always have to google portmanteau to be able to spell it , too . 
  also , i have to check whether the word i mean is portmanteau or [ portamento ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portamento ) . 
  can someone explain this to me ? 
  actually , he 's in all the wrong threads ... 
  check his recent post history . 
  he 's said this on over a dozen other posts . 
  i was too young at the time to know for certain , but i would have thought most of the usa 's backwards movement in freedoms came as a result of 9/11 . 
  is this wrong ? 
  ah , fair enough . 
  thanks . 
  any particular favourite songs/pieces or genres ? 
  edit : for this purpose , of course . 
  yeah , that 's exactly how i feel about it . 
  the concept of comparing bodies of work for a specific feature is fine , but doing it based on the memorisation of said texts is just pointless ... 
  thanks for the info . 
  so , did he ever get back to you on that ? 
  arrows ? 
  i rarely put arrows on my econ diagrams , unless it 's to specifically point out , say , a deadweight loss . 
  interesting thought . 
  coin was hoisted by her own petard , so to speak . 
  just one more reason to avoid the epic failure that is facebook chat . 
  what do you mean by consistency ? 
  if you mean between the different movements , then i would say that 's a bad reason to go a slower tempo . 
  different movements are meant to be different tempos . 
  if you mean that you ca n't play the whole piece at a faster tempo , then yes , you should slow down to keep a consistent tempo throughout the movement . 
  really , just go with whatever tempo you and your accompaniment ( be it a piano or orchestra ) are comfortable with , within reason . 
  obviously it 's not presto , or adagio , but anything within the range of about 120 -- 130 , or even as wide as 110-140 ( though either of those extremes would definitely be pushing it ) , would be understandable . 
   the internet :, 
  ftfy, 
  i do that somewhat sporadically , just because it feels right . 
  but i do n't really think they 're necessary , since you 've numbered the lines ad ** 1 ** and ad ** 2 ** , making it clear what direction the movement is in . 
  still , it never hurts to make it absolutely clear , i definitely agree .
