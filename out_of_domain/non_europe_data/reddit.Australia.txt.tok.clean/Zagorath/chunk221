  they refers to the set of theories , not a person . 
  ok , the definition of externalities i 'm going off of is nicely explained [ here ] ( http://i-study.co/ib%20economics/website/unit%202%20microeconomics/unit2-marketfailure.html ) . 
  does that help ? 
  on the whole we were taught a balance of keynesian and neo-classical economics . 
  because as nearly anyone could concede , neither has all the answers . 
  it just so happens that keynesian economics has the most robust theory when it comes to externalities , and so that 's what was taught in that area . 
  i 've been having really weird problems with it , but i assumed it was because of some oddities with the trackpad . 
  it works fine on medic , but not spy or heavy . 
  i reassigned it to the `` f '' key , and now it works for heavy and medic , but i still ca n't consistently get invisible on the spy . 
  is there any particular reason the mac version is incompatible with the windows one ? 
  i was annoyed to find out that in order to play with my friend ( who is mac only ) , i had to download it on my mac ( initially i only had it downloaded on my pc ) . 
  there 's no clear indication prior to the fact that this would be the case , and it 's not an unreasonable expectation to have , i do n't think . 
  no , austrian is not the same as what is today called neo-classical . 
  neo-classical economics today is applied almost exclusively at the micro-economic level , and does not work effectively when applied on a larger scale . 
  austrian economics largely claims that all macro-economics is simply applications of micro-economic theory : against the prevailing belief of most modern day economists . 
  and the beliefs of neoclassicism and keynesianism are most certainly not incompatible . 
  again , the widely accepted view of most economists today is some fusion of the two . 
  by neoclassical economics i mean just that .

  i hate being asked how much time i spend per week . 
  i often go months without any gaming and then game a huge amount for a while . 
  there 's no answer that truly accurately represents my gaming habits .

  edit : it seems we 've got someone silently watching and downvoting all your posts . 
  to whoever that is , please stop , and check [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  especially in a subreddit like / r/cmv , i would have thought that would be incredibly important . 
  oh ok , i 'll have to try it again . 
  i first tried it not long after the super cheap sale in advance of the gods and kings expansion ( when it was f2p for the weekend ) , so i can imagine the versions may have been different because of something relating to the expansion . . 
  so playing multiplayer between a mac and windows should work fine now ? 
  i just discovered this by accident when i typer '' / r/cmv '' , and res 's popup list suggested this ( i was in fact referring to / r/changemyview ) . 
  as someone currently studying software engineering at uni , i subscribed without hesitation , though i do n't know how much i can/will contribute . 
  just out of interest , perhaps you should contact the mods of / r/changemyview and talk to them about a cross-sidebar promotion . 
  also interesting would be if you could borrow their deltabot system for this subreddit . 
   uncontextualised sexual violence, 
  what would * contextualised * sexual violence be ? 
  and incentivised drug use , could you explain an actual example of that ? 
  i 'm curious as to how it works in the game . 
  we should ban any game where you attack people with frying pans because of explicit culinary violence !, 
  i agree , this would be really cool to see . 
  maybe someone should message the mods ? 
  as i said , we were taught neither full-on neoclassical economics nor full keynesian , but the fusion of the two which prevails in modern economics . 
  it just happened that my teacher focused on keynes vs hayek specifically . 
  i do n't think the ib curriculum actually specifically mentions hayek . 
  i could be wrong , though , i do n't remember that part of it all that well . 
  edit : and anarcho-communists are a thing ? 
  they propose sharing everything out equally , without a government to enforce that ? 
  that 's just my guess based on the name . 
  this is absolutely incredible and i 've signed up . 
  i 've got a university course next semester that is at least partly on sql , so the timing of this is amazing . 
  but unfortunately i currently do n't have a large amount of internet quota , and i wo n't have one until late july . 
  will the resources still be available then ? 
  ( better yet , any chance of text file resources ), 
  the [ baader-meinhof phenomenon ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/ ) , kinda . 
  no he means do n't * make * yourself a meme . 
  implying that / u/phil _ responds is attempting to create gifs that become memetic . 
  he 's trying to create a forced meme . 
   the one has a lot of exclusives on its own that actually look better than most ps ones, 
  you 're entitled to your opinion on that , but i believe you 'll find most people disagree . 
  the exclusives on playstation are far better , most people would say . 
  but of course it is just opinion , and if you prefer the xbox exclusives then feel free to buy them instead . 
  and rumours are irrelevant . 
  until they actually announce it ( if indeed they do ) , you ca n't argue against the fact that the ps4 is more indie-friendly than the xbox one . 
  oh yeah , what a great welcome to the subreddit you ( the general you , not necessarily you ochi ) gave him . 
  downvotes and snarky replies is a great way to make one feel welcome .

  but i do n't know if an organisation promoting it like that would be allowed . 
  nah , because it 's not a yes or no ( i.e. , binary ) question . 
  the askee can give the reason `` because i never started '' and it is a perfectly acceptable response given the question . 
  to a question beginning with `` have you '' responses must be yes or no to fit with the question syntax . 
  what ? 
  i 've found the abc , along with most australian tv news , to be incredibly impartial . 
  they 've simply asked questions that allow their interviewees to explain their opinions , and have seemed not to get into the debate of hero vs. traitor at all . 
  maybe a slight leaning in favour of snowden 's actions .

  huh ? 
  why do you group the two like that ? 
  rape is a deplorable crime ; sodomy is perfectly legal , even if it may not be to your ( or my ) taste . 
  damn , i only just noticed that it does n't have the `` other devices '' button . 
  luckily for me personally it 's a feature i only occasionally use , and he does have a button that lets you go back to the vanilla new tab page on a one-off basis . 
  depending on how often you use that feature , this may or may not be an acceptable solution for you . 
  i 'd just like to point out that it 's now wednesday and there still has n't been any official announcement regarding this change . 
  absolutely shit job , admins . 
  whether or not you use punctuation within brackets depends . 
  the best way to look at is : if you remove the brackets and replace them with commas , it should work , but it should also work if you remove them and everything within them . 
  in this case , he 's used it perfectly correctly . 
  because that 's what makes sense . 
  it 's clearly a play on the word image , and the g there is soft . 
  i 've always pronounced it im-gur , only the g is soft . 
  because it 's clearly a play on the word `` image '' ( hence soft g ) , but also it * is n't * spelt with the a there , so pronouncing it `` imager '' is adding a letter that is n't in any way there .

  we have much more of a two party system than most democracies . 
  uk , canada , and germany all come to mind as being far more multi-party . 
  we have labor and the liberal national coalition . 
  while the latter is technically multiple parties , effectively it functions as one party . 
  then there 's the greens , independents , and a few other minor parties that usually do n't hold much effective power in the reps. 
  indeed .
