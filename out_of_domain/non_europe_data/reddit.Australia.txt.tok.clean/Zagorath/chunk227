   star wars downunder is a 30 minute star wars fan film, 
  from the description . 
  so actually , yes , it 's going to be a real film !, 
  [ here 's an interview with the director ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkdm9cyvhky ) , and according to the [ facebook fan page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/star-wars-downunder-fan-film/136031256587629 ) the full film should come out late august or early september . 
  no , you 've got it the wrong way around . 
  pi day , 14th march , only works when you flip the dates , but pi approximation day works with the typical day-month format . 
  ~ ~ fun fact , remembering 3.14 is actually much more accurate than 22/7 , and thus using the fraction 22/7 is completely pointless . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ pi to 4 dp is 3.1416 . ~ ~, 
  edit : retracted , that was wrong, 
  cheers . 
  statement retracted . 
  thanks for this . 
  i would be worried if there were this many blatant errors in an official release . 
  you have breeds of dogs , not species . 
  internet , is technically supposed to be capitalised . 
   player 's can fast travel . 
  the player 's * what * can fast travel ? 
  have you got some wood for my sheep ? 
  eh do n't worry about it . 
  i did n't see it last week , and based on the upvotes this got , many others did n't either . 
  holy shit i did n't notice that . 
  actually , i think it 's perfect if reddit does get blocked . 
  it gives people an above-board reason to opt out of this without being deemed a pervert . 
  ( i 'm assuming opt-out is a single thing you need to do to opt out of blocking on * all * sites . ), 
  i agree , proportional voting ( through stv , preferably ) would be great , but in the meantime we need to discuss how one should vote under the current system , which is what was taking place above . 
  i find it abhorrent that one party could theoretically receive slightly over 25 % of the popular vote and still form a majority government ( 50 % + 1 of the votes in 50 % + 1 of the seats ) . 
  for the moment , however , that is the reality of the situation . 
  do you not understand how our political system works ? 
  sure , you can vote for the greens or wikileaks or whichever minor parties are running candidates in your electorate , but you also need to preference the major parties at some point , and therefore decide which of the two will get the higher preference . 
  being practical , it 's likely that said major party will be the one that ends up receiving your vote , so its worth discussing in this manner which of the two parties you will ` vote ' for ( by which it is meant which of the two gets preferenced first ) . 
   the greens have 10 % of the national vote with less than 1 % of the seats, 
  and yet in our government as it stands today , they and the independents hold the balance of power . 
  sure in our current political climate we are mainly stuck with a two party system ( even when compared to the aforementioned uk 's three party system ) , but that does n't mean you can * completely * discount the greens and independents . 
   i 'd recommend against assassins creed or the witcher 1/2 on mac, 
  i played broho on a severely lowly-specked mbp , and the first bit ( giant epic battle ) ran unbelievably awfully , but after that it was playable . 
  the witcher , however , is awful . 
  it seems to run just fine , but will randomly just crash on a very frequent basis . 
  i 'm looking into ways of getting around it by updating the wine wrapper , which others have said works great , but i have n't gotten around to it yet .

  plus [ this updated download link ] ( http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=downloads ) . 
  the best thing about this is that it * still * works on a mac . 
  you can have any computer you like and you get the incredibly google ecosystem . 
  it 's the clear better choice if you , like me , use both windows and os x. 
  well damn . 
  this is n't the subreddit for it , but you just changed my view on this , so have this [ \u2206 ] ( / r/changemyview ) . 
  yep , i 'm seeing it currently for us$ 12.50 down from the normal $ 50 . 
  shh ... people want to whinge about not having better quality ads in the free service they use . 
  i had a friend describing crusader kings to me recently and the first thing i had to ask was : is there a game of thrones mod for this game ? 
  we 're not talking about that . 
  we 're talking about the whole ecosystem . 
  sure your iphone works , but you do n't get the seamless integration of apple 's incredible ical , and their other ( less amazing , imo ) software like contacts and mail , or the synchronisation that occurs between the ios and mac versions of safari . 
  you 're lucky to have seen that . 
  i once saw four people from yorkshire on the front page . 
  if it were community effort i 'd be happy to put my hand in the ring to help with music . 
  my programming skills are currently very low ( i 'm in first year of a software engineering course at uni ) , and i ca n't design for shit . 
   this was a secret treaty , allegedly so secret that it was kept secret from the australian prime ministers until 1973 . 
  ( signed in 1946 by the uk and us , but it only says `` later '' signed by the other countries . 
  still , that 's probably a long time to keep the secret . ), 
  aye but what the oc did n't mention was that his * nephew * ( the newborn prince of cambridge ) would also have to die . 
  that 's much less likely to happen of natural causes . 
   because like most monarchies the line continues with the firstborn ~ ~ ( son ) ~ ~ . 
  changed as of this year . 
  even if the child of william and kate had been female , she would have been third in line for the throne ( and still would be third in line if william and kate went on to have a boy later ) . 
  there 's a difference between * default to a male leader * -- which is what the uk did until this year -- where if a king produces no male heirs then his daughter will rule after him , and * no females ever * , where if a king produces only female children the crown would pass on to his brother or nephew ( if the brother is dead ) . 
  come on man . 
  spoilers . 
  because the r18 + rating was n't to allow adults to play any games we want , it was to ` protect ' 15 year olds from games that were previously being shoe-horned into the ma15 + rating . 
  not at all what we wanted to happen . 
   i think the disproportionate distribution of seats in the senate is also pointlessly undemocratic , personally . 
  one of the only parts of your post i completely agree with . 
  we 've got the same issue here in aus . 
  all of our states have an equal 12 senators , plus the two major territories get 2 each . 
  considering the population difference between new south wales and tasmania 7.2 million vs 0.5 million ) it makes no sense that they should have the same number of representatives , giving each tasmanian 14 times the representation of a new south welshman . 
  the fact that within each state the winning senators are elected using stv is nice , though . 
  i do n't know how senate elections work in the us . 
  i see what you 're saying there , but it simply does n't happen . 
  they have time limits on most speeches here in australia and you never get any of the problems mentioned . 
  why on earth would you choose a theremin and a horse head mask to use for scale ? 
  i like you . 
  i 've also been noticing higher drop rates of keys , anyone else noticed this ? 
  it 's probably because he is an arsehole . 
  / u/numendil 's comment in reply to his is the perfect summation of my feelings here . 
  also you ca n't compare samsung 's dozens of products against apple 's 1 current model + a couple of older models . 
  comparisons really should be made between current apple flagship vs current samsung flagship . 
  i got ta say , that 's a feature i really * do n't * want , and it 's one reason i refuse to use whatsapp . 
  my smses are smses , and my ims are ims . 
  i do n't want the two conflated . 
  i use facebook messenger , g + messenger , and skype for ims , and android 's sms app for smses . 
  i do n't want my phone number tied to an account for sending messages using data . 
  ( and i was really annoyed when facebook decided to start receiving my sms messages until i figured out how to turn that off . ), 
  is the iphone not also ` free ' ? 
  i prefer to buy outright , but checking local telcos , both samsung and apple 's flagship devices here are sold at zero upfront . 
  since we 're talking about australia here , here 's the major reason i refuse to buy samsung . 
  ( and , as the techy among my friends , recommend against buying samsung to others . ), 
  for context , what he says about halfway through about how people love him for his unbiased opinions is n't tooting his own horn at all , it is absolutely , completely , true . 
  for me personally , and a lot of other people , he 's the absolute number one source of information about cameras and phones . 
  the fact that i do n't like all the crapware and gimmicks samsung puts on their phones does n't help either . 
  ( loving my nexus 4 , though . ), 
  just so you know , everything he described there , is android , not samsung . 
  buying nexus means you get software updates straight away ( samsung devices notoriously often take a long time to get updates ) , and you get the much nicer native android interface , without the crapware and gimmicks that samsung puts into their phones .
