  i personally carry an external battery when i 'm expecting to need longer than my battery can hold . 
  i do n't see the point in replaceable batteries really . 
  they 're going to take up space in your pocket anyway , and a phone with a replaceable battery means the mechanism is taking up space , so each battery is smaller than it otherwise could be . 
  ( i have a nexus 4 -- without replaceable battery . ), 
  when you said queue epic fight scene i was expecting [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-u4yr9unbo ), 
  no sd card is the only thing i dislike about my nexus 4 compared to some android devices . 
  sadly , it seems google 's philosophy with android has moved away from desiring sd card for extra storage , in favour of online streaming of content ( which is problematic when you 've got limited data ... ) . 
  unfortunately , there are n't any options as good as itunes . 
  it 's one of the undeniable disadvantages of android . 
  there is doubletwist , which is supposed to be pretty good , though i personally do n't have experience with it . 
  i 've just copied music over manually using android 's file transfer application . 
  [ here 's a link that provides instructions on using doubletwist , as well as syncing other content . 
  ] ( http://www.macworld.com/article/2039052/how-to-sync-an-android-phone-to-your-mac.html ), 
  and google when it comes to the software . 
  ( htc has some audio software features that are neat , and apple 's got some claims to fame in useability , but samsung 's got nothing but gimmicks and i do n't know about lg . 
  none of them have anything to compare to google . ), 
  not really . 
  step 2 does n't ` start ' , it 's there from the beginning . 
  better would be :, 
  as you mention, 
  your number 3, 
  some other company rips off apple 's designs and technology in quite a blatant way, 
  other company starts differentiating themselves and innovating themselves -- in smaller steps than apple 's initial creation , but still far more than apple 's rather stagnant design . 
  apple loses market share . 
  although it obviously never happened with mp3 players , and i do n't think that 's really how it went down with mac os , either . 
  in that case it was more just to do with the price and availability . 
  it goes against how i prefer to use my phone . 
  for me , the phone number is a service tied to my telco . 
  if i 'm using my phone number , i want to know that 's something going over their network as a call , sms , or mms , and not using my data . 
  services like the ones mentioned above confuse the matter completely unnecessarily . 
  using a pseudonym as a username is much simpler . 
  there really needs to be a repository of tasker `` recipes '' like there is for ifttt . 
  it 's confusing and difficult to use , even if you can think of things to use it for . 
  but it 's so incredibly powerful , and i doubt there 's anyone who could n't find * some * use for it , if they could just think of it . 
  could i get some context behind this ? 
  what 's the point of the question , and why is his answer funny ( aside from the fact that the answer is obvious ... ) ? 
   some people do n't want waterproof designs and being able to drop it on hard surface, 
  i think you 're not quite wording yourself correctly here . 
  i do n't think * anybody * would actively not want those things . 
  they just might not be willing to pay more , or have a heavier/thicker phone for them . 
  except the difference is an automatic car provides a very clear advantage . 
  i do n't see the advantage in using your phone number as a username . 
  it 's just as easy ( i would argue * easier * ) to use a pseudonym with which to add your friends . 
  i can just say `` add me on sitex , my username is zagorath '' , and that 's fairly easy to remember . 
  if i tell them my phone number ( if i even * know * my phone number ) , it 's far easier to forget . 
  as someone outside the us , i already knew that fun fact , and was in fact somewhat surprised to learn how prevalent they are in the us . 
  that said , here in aus i would describe them as fairly common , though ** far ** from ubiquitous . 
  i have unlimited mms , i do n't have unlimited data . 
  it also wo n't cost the receiver to receive an mms , but will with data . 
  fair point , but again , we 're comparing the quarter where samsung released a new flagship phone to the one likely directly prior to apple releasing theirs . 
  i do n't either , to be honest , i just do n't like seeing people making inaccurate comparisons . 
   you 're not quite wording yourself correctly here, 
  it may be what you * meant * but you did n't make it completely clear that 's what you meant . 
  your exact wording was `` do n't want '' , which implies people would rather not have it . 
  1 and 2 seem to be breaking the commandments ... 
  have you got any economic examples ? 
  the only one that comes to mind for me is dumping done by the eu because of their common agricultural policies , but i imagine there are a heap more potential examples . 
  * yet *, 
  you 're using that in * completely * the wrong context . 
  you 're already taking the massive step of risking yourself to reveal this information . 
  that never happened . 
  all air traffic in the united states and canada * only * was grounded until 13th september . 
  apart from that united airline ( a private company ) cancelled all flights worldwide , and commercial flights over central london were rerouted around it . 
  the us is not the entire world , much as it would like to think it is . 
  but that 's not what we 're comparing . 
  we 're comparing releasing publicly , with your name attached to it , to secretly leaking it , anonymously , without anyone ( hopefully ) knowing its you . 
  even so , that is n't the context the quote is meant in . 
  the quote is meant regarding accepting of laws that take away liberties for the sake of privacy , ** not ** the actions of an individual to protect themselves , or not , by holding back , or not , information . 
  no it is n't . 
  i disagree with all this business as much as anybody with half a brain , but calling it a slippery slope is simply fallacious . 
  wanting to force people to opt in to something can not be proven to lead to eventually banning it , and claiming they will is nothing short of a fallacy and scaremongering . 
  what 'd he say ? 
  what did i miss ? 
  he ca n't because there is n't . 
  it 's a sound economic argument with theory behind it , but the studies have shown that the theoretical effects of increasing minimum wage are at * best * overblown , and in reality are only very minor . 
  i agree that not an inch should be given , but it 's not on the fallacious grounds that this inch will inevitably lead to more inches , which simply has not been demonstrated . 
  this inch should n't be given , because * this inch * is a bad idea . 
  it is n't * always * a fallacy , however it so nearly is that it might as well be . 
  if it can be * demonstrated * beyond doubt , that a leads to b , which leads to c , which leads to d ( which is the thing we do n't want to happen ) , then that is a slippery slope , and is a valid argument . 
  however , since this is virtually never the case , all actual uses of the slippery slope `` argument '' are fallacious , including this one . 
  thankfully , you 're not the only one who recognises this . 
  the comment above yours ( / u/roflcopter _ rego ) and my own comment , which currently appears below yours , both point out this fallacious reasoning . 
  yeah that was my initial thought , but then the conversation about it continued after the release of the mac version . 
  so it really is n't clear . 
   the glorification caught me off-guard with its particular ferocity, 
  to be fair , based on the discussion at the beginning , i feel like that 's what they were going for . 
  same with the loud percussion and different-to-normal balance . 
  on the topic of the proms , does anyone know where i can find ( * if * i can find ) the lecture that went along with the 6th prom ( nielsen symphony and rach 2 ) ? 
  i was at the concert , but could n't attend the lecture beforehand , and i 'm curious as to what was said in it . 
  it was an incredible concert , by the way , and if anyone ever gets the chance to see a prom , i would highly recommend it . 
  as a side note , can i just say , the choice of camera angle at 8:00 on the flute was absolutely awful . 
  made the flute look like some sort of metre long monstrosity . 
  also , the bass drummist just before 17:00 is kinda hot , and the violinist at 31:35 looks really creepy . 
  edit : found the lecture http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b036v8tr, 
  and the official mac version is n't a wineskin version ? 
  ( i know , for example , the witcher for mac , even when downloaded through steam , is an awfully executed wineskin version . ), 
  awesome , thanks . 
  i can blow out into a cup of water ( through a straw ) for over a minute . 
  unfortunately , i * ca n't * circular breath into my instrument ... 
  listening to just the authorisation bit , i thought it had to be edited .
