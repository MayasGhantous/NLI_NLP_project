  is that the liberal party 's official youtube ? 
  because if it is , i have to hand them one thing , it 's good that they 're leaving votes and comments open . 
  i 'm watching that one now !, 
  just started the first movement . 
  i thought [ this moment ] ( http://imgur.com/9xegmk5 ) was absolutely hilarious to watch . 
  [ and i 've done it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmemes/comments/1j0etu/bbc_proms_editing_logic/ ), 
  that second one there 's great , but unfortunately the syllable selecting bot messed up on the last line ... 
  elected . 
  that is, 
  a strong economy and, 
  that is a real,

  team fortress 2 is free and works with across platform multiplayer . 
  of course c minor would be the `` tortured genius '' . 
  becomes harder for people to realise that they 're a troll on a regular basis . 
  not really . 
  i saw one comment that mentioned how they did n't believe it could have been written by her , and all the rest were quite clear they knew it was n't . 
  what i 'm seeing itt is `` wow she has good handwriting '' . 
  i did n't ? 
  i 'm seeing 3 upvotes . 
  awesome . 
  definitely gon na give it a go . 
  i saw a thread on reddit a while back where someone did something similar in monopoly . 
  they started doing things like loaning properties , having partial ownerships in them etc. 
  it was really cool to read about . 
  definitely . 
  i came to this page to argue devil 's advocate with op , though i agree with his point . 
  it was n't necessary , though , because others had mentioned more or less the same thing i was going to . 
  pancakes and waffles are both amazing . 
  french toast is ... meh . 
  oh , really ? 
  i 've only ever seen the curved alto flutes . 
  huh ... til , thanks . 
  really ? 
  the only people i know who use it are because they think they 're posh using the high cultured european term . 
  edit : australians , though , not americans . 
  mistake ? 
  i 'm now going to deliberately do it because it 's funny . 
  i could be wrong , but would n't the second c in that would be a hard c , meaning it would be pronounced more like ` conkeption ' ? 
   i feel as if a lot of people tend to forget that the foreign media we consume is the best that country has to offer . 
  this does n't apply , unfortunately , to american media . 
  ah ok , thanks . 
  i was under the impression c was nearly always pronounced as a hard c in spanish . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
   if you ca n't support yourself with adverts , then maybe you 're just not good enough to be on tv . 
  yeah sorry , but this is just crap . 
  here in australia , the very best television is on the abc , a government funded tv station . 
  they 're the most neutral news source , they 've got brilliant shows like [ media watch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_watch_ ( tv_program \\ ) ) , a show centred around calling out the media ( tv news , newspapers , etc. , including the abc itself ) on mistakes or bad practices ; [ qanda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/q%26a_ ( australian_talk_show \\ ) ) , where a mixed panel ( politicians , artists , religious figures , etc ) takes -- often hard -- questions from the audience ; and the chaser , which is a satirical comedy group . 
  the first two of these simply * could n't * exist in a format that is n't government funded . 
  the last one could , but would undoubtably not be the same quality because it would be biased in favour of the network that funds it . 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  presumably , paying for things . 
  if you want to pay for things , then that 's fine , but most of us are perfectly happy getting them for free . 
  if i have to see an ad from time to time , i 'm perfectly happy with that . 
  imagine all the sites you use that have advertising . 
  reddit , facebook , gmail , youtube , news sites , and on and on . 
  now imagine if you had to pay a fee of , say , $ 2 per month for * every * single one of them . 
  maybe $ 5 for youtube because of its higher bandwidth costs . 
  that cost is going to add up * very * fast . 
  because of how the internet works ( hyperlinks going from site to site ) , it just is n't feasible for most sites to be funded this way . 
  even during the war . 
  they had the same kinds of oppressive dictatorship stuff going on , but they were n't nearly as technologically behind the rest of the world as nk is today . 
  hear hear . 
  it really frustrates me how many people do n't get this . 
  the bill gates qanda was absolutely awful , with people bashing one of the most philanthropic people in the world over his old company 's * completely legal * tax practices . 
  cheers, 
  what instrument does yo-yo ma play ? 
  jesus he lasted that long ? 
  he was top the first time i checked ( though that was a while after i started ) and still top when i quit ... 
  harry potter 5 was probably the fastest i ever read a book . 
  got through the entire thing in two , maybe two and a half days . 
  i think being meta is what will be nostalgic about the ' 10s . 
  i went to the cadbury factory recently !, 
  and i 'm very ashamed of you guys that you do n't have cherry ripes . 
  they 're the best , man . 
  i dunno i 'm pretty sure patrick stewart played himself perfectly . 
  ~ ~ bieber hardly grew up with it , either . 
  he became famous when he was what , 17 ? ~ ~, 
  better examples would be some of the disney child stars . 
  crash course us history also debunked the claims that the other factors were more important than slavery . 
  oh come on guys . 
  are we really downvoting this ? 
  at the * very * least , he mentioned what the movie was . 
  convenience is n't liberty , anyway . 
  those jobs left because the us was n't the right place for them . 
  sure you could bring a few back by measures like lowering minimum wage ( like it is n't low enough over there already ) and lowering safety standards , but those actions would have a negative effect on workers ' rights and would send the country backwards in terms of development . 
  it 's simple economics , specifically the law of comparative advantage . 
  the opportunity cost of production of using labour for ` production jobs ' is far lower in developing asian countries , so its only natural that they will move there . 
  well , not quite . 
  there was still a year and a half of the 00s before that . 
  ( and do n't get technical with the whole ` the new decade starts in the year starting in 1 ' thing , like how the 3rd millennium really started in 2001 . 
  that only applies if you 're numbering the decade/century/millennium sequentially based on time , not based on the individual digits . ), 
  so far ? 
  hate to break it to you , but they 've been over for 3 and a half years now . 
  holy fuck seriously ? 
  i guess i was wrong .
