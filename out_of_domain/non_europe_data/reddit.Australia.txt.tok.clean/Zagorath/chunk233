  so yes , the graph claims that driving 10 k over the limit is the safest way to drive ( where `` safest '' means least likely to get into some sort of incident -- not the severity of incidents ) . 
  it 'd be nice if you could provide a source for that graph . 
  definitely agree . 
  i would say that there 's a huge difference between what the nsa has recently been exposed as doing , and surveillance cameras in public places . 
  if you 're in public locations then you have no reasonable expectation of privacy , and there 's no * real * issue with the surveillance cameras , beyond the beebiejeebies . 
  but going through someone 's private communications is a massive violation of privacy . 
  however , another question that must be asked is , does the uk 's similar agency do the same thing ? 
  i 'd say there 's a more-than-zero chance . 
   the property owner who constamtly has to pay to get `` lil j '13 reprzent '' scrubbed off his building, 
  i think this is what should change . 
  the punishment for being caught graffitiing should be community service spent removing their own ( and other people 's ) graffiti . 
  can i just provide a general public announcement here guys . 
  downvotes do n't change views . 
  i 'm seeing a lot of op 's comments downvoted a lot . 
  this completely goes against the etiquette of this subreddit , let alone reddit has a whole . 
  ( sorry that i had to break rule 1 to point this out , i hope the mods do n't mind . ), 
  no i agree complete . 
  toilets are n't a gender thing , they 're a sex thing . 
  you go into the one that matches your * biological sex * . 
  just so you have the full information , / u/koreth just replied to me with a more concrete answer on the true surveillance in the uk . 
  it 's called [ tempora ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tempora ) , and was leaked by snowden . 
  so yeah , our suspicions would appear to be correct . 
  cheers, 
  so it is . 
  cheers . 
  no , it is most definitely . 
  i 've more or less * only * lived in places with what i would call perfect climate . 
  but trying to objectify it and use it on a scale like this is what i disagree with . 
  how do you define ` hot ' and ` cold ' ? 
  i imagine my definitions would be different to someone from england , which would be different to a russian . 
  even sunniness is hard to define . 
  how much cloud cover is needed for it not to be sunny ? 
  and is all sunny a good thing ? 
  rain helps things grow , and too much sun exposure can lead to skin cancer . 
  assuming the rest of your comment is correct ( / u/shalevbd 's comment would imply it is n't , but we 'll assume it is as a premise ) , you could get the energy you need ( ` calories ' you term it , but i find that a bad term both because it is a specific * unit * rather than the general term , and also because it is n't the si unit for energy , which is joules : kilojoules being used normally for food ) mainly from complex carbohydrates such as whole grain bread or pasta . 
  you make an argument based on what could theoretically happen . 
  it 's a slippery slope fallacy , although you avoided making the mistake of explicitly calling it that . 
  the cameras are there with a legitimate purpose , and can be and are used as such . 
  sure they * could * be used for tracking people and preventing legal protests , but that would be an illegal act by the government/police . 
  invading your private communications is very different . 
  there , you have a reasonable expectation that no one is watching you and if anybody is , they are invading your privacy just as surely as if those cameras were put inside your own home . 
  no he is n't . 
  his thought process is bizarre , but there are many biblical scholars that take a similarly metaphorical approach to the bible . 
  usually , though , these same people are not young earth creationists as our friend here is . 
  the difference is in public you * do not have an * ** expectation ** * of privacy * . 
  you are in public . 
  anyone can see what you 're doing and , if they so choose , record it . 
  why should the government not also be allowed ? 
  i misread and thought he was saying the earth is 7000 years old . 
  you can not state that they will abuse it . 
  that 's a slippery slope fallacy . 
  you can only make a slippery slope argument if it can be definitely shown that a must lead to b , which must lead to c. 
  i do n't know about your constitution , but if you 're in public , you do n't have privacy . 
  it really is that simple . 
  neither do i. i just press option s. ( yay os x :d ), 
  ah , that i did n't know , and if true would certainly change the reading of this graph . 
  i know you 're using that as a reductio ad absurdum , but you know what , i agree . 
  average police should n't be armed with lethal weapons either , * all * police should go through * far * stricter instruction on how and when to use their weapons . 
  i would say the ideal would be an honour system based on genitalia . 
  if you have the secondary characteristics to be able to pass for the opposite sex , then nobody will be any the wiser so who cares . 
  if they abuse it , then you fight against that abuse of power . 
  there 's no need to fight the actual legitimate use case to do so . 
  i have n't read anything ( edit : from your post or the current single comment . 
  i am working my way through the books atm ) because i want to avoid spoilers . 
  is this post regarding the books , or can someone who is up to date with the tv show contribute to this discussion sans spoilers ? 
  but would reading what op wrote spoil something that has n't yet happened in the show for me ? 
  even a small spoiler , i would rather avoid . 
  i 've so far only read agot . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  hmm , i 've never heard this theory before . 
  i thought it was * known * that jon is eddard 's kid , does this theory claim that he is n't ? 
  personally from the first book only , it seems his looks and character are far too much like ned for him to * not * be ned 's kid . 
  ( so i would agree with you this theory is bizarre . ), 
  i started uni in feb/mar this year and still do n't have one . 
  yes , i guess that would be why they do n't need it . 
  i actually just went through the online application form . 
  this thread reminded me to . 
  people have a right to their own bodies . 
  i would say that if you have n't agreed to donate your organs ( ideally by default : you have to actively opt out of it if you do n't want to donate ) , then you should be sent way to the back of the waiting list , but i would n't make it completely mandatory . 
  huh ? 
  where 'd you get that idea . 
  until fairly recently , the resistance were constantly on top in global mu counts . 
  and for people who do n't know which side is winning and who have n't looked in great detail into the philosophies of each side , the resistance initially comes across as cooler just because of the name . 
  it conjures up images of things like the rebel alliance in star wars , or the french resistance in wwii . 
  it does n't matter that that actually is * far * from the truth of it , they seem the better choice , so people go there . 
  add to that the fact that the game pushed you to join resistance and its not surprising they had such a large lead . 
   transcribed with all typo ** 's ** etc [ emphasis mine ], 
  this is * so * close to being muphry 's law , but it is n't quite . 
  i 've always imagined this ( as well as the way you think faster when , say , falling ) as similar to alternating frame rates on a camera . 
  if you shoot at a standard 24 fps , and play back at 24 fps , then everything plays back at the same rate as normal . 
  but if you shoot at 48 fps ( or , your brain is doing more ` calculations ' per second ) it still plays back at 24 fps , and thus it seems as though it 's slow motion . 
  do any biologists/psychologists know if this is a fairly decent analogy ? 
  oh god that whole film was awful . 
  neeson 's character was completely unbelievable . 
  oh , let 's take all their wallets but for goodness sake do n't take anything that might be useful to fucking survive out in the middle of nowhere . 
  could we make it a a part of / r/australia etiquette that if you share a link to a paywalled site , you copy paste the content of the article into the comments ? 
  that would be more appropriate on stravinsky , methinks . 
  fun fact , there have been people who survived accidents specifically because they * were * thrown clear of the accident . 
  i 'm not sure of the details ; escaped an explosion or a second impact most likely . 
  some people use this as justification for not wearing their seatbelt themselves .
