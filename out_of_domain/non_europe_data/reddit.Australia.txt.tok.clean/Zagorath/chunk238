  i assume he used the term `` vote donkey '' synonymously with `` spoil your ballot '' . 
  that 's what i took away from reading it , anyway . 
  and afaik , they actually do n't count clear donkey votes , anyway , so your vote would n't * actually * go to the first-placed party on the ballot paper . 
  how does it work in nz ? 
  edit : i looked it up , they have a unicameral system voted in using mmp . 
  i 'm not a fan of mmp , since it institutionalises parties as part of the system , which comes with all sorts of problems . 
  unicameralism is problematic , too , since it removes the checks that come with an upper house ( especially one where senators sit for two election periods ) . 
  tbh , i 'd prefer to stay with our system rather than copy new zealand on this issue . 
  a move to stv in the reps would be cool , though . 
  i * despise * libertarianism , but i love the [ political compass ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) ( which abc 's vote compass is clearly modelled after . 
  i would strongly recommend reading their `` analysis '' page ( preferably after having taken the test yourself first ) , as well as their faq . 
  they do a great job of explaining the merits of this voting system . 
  yeah , i was also waiting ages for it . 
  in fact , right after rudd announced the election , it was one of the first places i went , hoping it would already be up . 
  turned out it was n't until a few days later . 
  still , i 'm really impressed at the quick turnaround . 
  it 's also already been submitted to both / r/australia ( i tried when i first discovered it , and it already had been then ) and [ / r/australianpolitics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australianpolitics/comments/1jv833/the_political_compass_australian_general_election/ ) . 
   alcohol and tobacco taxation increases, 
  very definitively an economic issue . 
  better would be the ridiculous laws about drinking in public . 
  labor is now officially pro -- gay marriage . 
  on the whole , though , i would tend to agree with you . 
  it would be a fallacious argument , except that you presented a fallacious red herring argument . 
  / u/fumblus never said you should only consider one axis , they merely pointed out that in the end you have to pick an absolute order of preferences -- which is absolutely true . 
  i do n't know how it originated , but the difference makes perfect sense . 
  the term `` liberal '' was first used ( i believe ) in france following the revolution , when they needed to decide how to set up their parliament . 
  the `` liberals '' were in favour of what is now known as right wing economics : keeping government intervention in the economy to a minimum . 
  thus , the economy is liberal , being `` free '' of intervention . 
  similarly , the american system of applying `` liberal '' to the social axis makes sense . 
  the liberal side of politics prefers to keep the government out of people 's private lives , leaving them `` free '' to behave how they want as individuals . 
  both terms have merit , though it is somewhat unusual ( though typical of america ) that the us uses the term differently to most of the rest of the world . 
  upvoting because you should n't be downvoted for sharing an interesting experience . 
  that said , i would recommend against basing your vote purely on your position on this compass . 
  far better would be to use the compass as a launch pad for further investigation into the issues which matter most to you . 
  the compass even has convenient more detailed explanations of the policies and the reasoning behind them . 
  it may also be worthwhile trying out the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) , which many regard as a somewhat better compass than abc 's one ( though again , i would n't be basing my vote purely on position in the compass ) . 
  hmm , i just took the test again and after the policy questions , it came up with :, 
   from what you saw , heard or read about the debate , who do you think won ? 
  the options being `` kevin rudd '' , `` tony abbott '' , and `` do n't know '' . 
  none of the above would be my preferred answer . 
  the debate was dull and inconclusive . 
  not that i do n't know , just that i actively say `` neither '' . 
  just a small thing i noted just now . 
  ah thanks for the correction . 
  i had been told that they did n't count them . 
  and yeah , the issue of `` what if you do want to genuinely vote in that way '' was my main issue with the idea . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  you do n't see many bicycles anymore . 
  a lot of motorbikes : more of them than cars , in fact , but not so much pushies . 
  yep , you nailed it . 
  i say it 's counter-intuitive because it 's famous for crazy traffic . 
  tourists are often terrified of crossing the road ( it can be quite funny to watch ) . 
  but organised chaos is exactly the right way to describe it , and once you know how it works it 's incredibly easy to do . 
  the much slower speeds of driving would also play a big part in it feeling safer . 
  on my regular route to and from school , i would often pass cars and motorbikes on my pushie ( usually because they were stuck in traffic or were going especially slow ) . 
  slower speeds necessarily mean you 're safer . 
  what 's the law here regarding medicinal use of marijuana ? 
  i do n't smoke it and it 's not a big issue in politics , so i 'm not fully aware of the laws surrounding it . 
  hmm , their candidates in queensland -- melanie thomas and liam pomfret -- are n't in the list of candidates for queensland on [ below the line ] ( http://www.belowtheline.org.au/state/qld.html ) . 
  hopefully after friday , when the nominations are officially announced , they 'll get added . 
  but thanks for the link , i 've been aware of the pirate party , but this is the first time i 've looked into them and they seem pretty decent . 
  i upvoted [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/huskers/comments/1jhe80/pinnacle_bank_arena_got_the_court_put_in_the_new/ ) because self posts do n't count for karma . 
  posts are archived after 6 months , so anything earlier than that should suffice . 
  _ what does reddit use the underscore as for formatting ? _, 
  edit : italics , apparently ... not sure why , though , * asterisks already do that job * . 
  yeah they 're open to conscience votes , but since they 've got a leader who supports it , a leader in the senate who is openly homosexual , and they have committed to putting it to vote in the first 100 days should they win reelection , i think it would be fair to claim that the * party * is officially pro-marriage equality . 
  that said , my representative currently is wayne swan , and he 's opposed , at least according to [ this site ] ( http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/whereyourmpstands/electorates/lilley/ ) . 
  if it does get put to the vote in parliament , i 'll definitely be writing to whoever my representative is to urge them to vote for it . 
  `` i 'm probably late to the party '', 
  gets more upvotes than any other top comment here , and 2 months of gold . 
   it 's times like this that a wish parties would nominate multiple candidates from different factions so that we had a choice as to whether our labor/liberal candidate was from the left/wet or the right/dry wing of the party, 
  i 've never even considered that , but it would be a brilliant idea . 
  only problem is that the majority would probably vote above the line and just give preference to whichever candidate comes first there . 
  i ca n't help but think it would work out better under stv , though ... 
  i think op 's post was quite clearly about the ` normal ' brand of libertarianism , the one represented by the libertarian party in the united states . 
  right wing economics , libertarian on social policies , as classified by the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) . 
   you payback 3 % of your total sales, 
  never mind the rest of it , this should be * illegal * . 
  the jupiter symphony was one of the two set pieces i had to study for ib music . 
  one of my favourite mozart pieces , though i must admit i 'm not a huge fan of mozart . 
  as stephen hawking says , it 's c major , not minor . 
  i saw this recently at the bbc proms , performed by blind pianist nobuyuki tsujii . 
  absolutely stunning . 
  great song , but it 's not classical . 
  it may be `` a classic '' , but classical is a different genre and you very well know it . 
  gasp , you listed all of those beethoven 's and left out the 7th ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the way misogynistic gets thrown around like this . 
  there is a very definitive difference between sexist and misogynistic . 
  this is almost certainly the former , and not the latter ( though a statement could conceivably be both ) . 
  if you 're looking for someone to vote for that will support fair use ( we do n't have very robust fair dealing laws at the moment ) , the [ pirate party australia ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/copyright#create_additional_exceptions_to_copyright ) supports far stronger exceptions to copyright law on the basis of fair use . 
  they 're running candidates for the senate in [ all the eastern states ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/candidates/ ) . 
  unfortunately , under the current voting system it * is * an inevitability . 
  there is nothing people can do to remove the two party system unless the voting system is changed . 
  that does n't mean you ca n't push for a change to something like stv , though . 
  in fact , that would be brilliant . 
  it 's unlikely to happen , but well worth the effort if you can get it to happen . 
  i saw the gun control things when they were floating around a little while back . 
  watched community two weeks ago ( the whole thing in about 10 days it was that good ) , but did n't make the connection with him until i saw this . 
  it was a massive `` whoa '' moment . 
  clever name .
