  but i 'm with / u/geneusutwerk , i 'd probably make a joke about it . 
  do not record the concert , post it to youtube , and then add the text `` no copyright infringement intended '' to the video . 
  that text is as meaningless as a bassoon doubling a fortissississimo trombone part . 
  urgh yes , people doing that always makes me roll my eyes . 
  do they just completely not understand how it works , or is it meant to be ironic ? 
  ( `` that '' and `` it '' can apply to either the copyright notice or the doubling ;d ), 
  the `` average '' ( mean ) number of arms is slightly less than 2.0 , because some people have less than 2 arms . 
  some people probably have more than 2 arms , but the number of those is less than the number of people with less than two arms , thus the mean is below 2 . 
  so if you have exactly 2 arms , you 're above the average . 
  it 's a play on the fact that when you hear average in this context , your mind instantly goes to the `` mode '' which is simply the most common number , and is another type of average . 
  if you 're in aus ( and i would assume other places ) you could probably get your money back if they do that without permission . 
  ( thank god for strong regulation . ), 
  [ it was a joke ] ( http://youtu.be/xe1a1whxtyo ), 
  awesome !, 
  many thanks . 
  really ? 
  how does this screw advertisers ? 
  seems like they 'd love it , to me . 
  with seven pages , that 's seven sets of ads for one article , rather than just a single set . 
  is n't that better for advertisers ? 
  seems it screws over users more by having to sit through loading times and * see * 7 times the ads . 
  it actually is . 
  unlike with sight , very few people are actually * totally * deaf . 
  being deaf or hearing is a spectrum , and everyone is somewhere along that spectrum . 
  at which point you choose to start calling someone `` deaf '' is arbitrary , and so there is a legal point at which the term deaf can apply . 
  if it only applied to people with exactly * no * hearing , the term would be meaningless as so few people could use it . 
  it 's bizarre to me that the cabinet in the us does n't have to come from congress , in the same way cabinet must come from parliament in australia . 
  economies of scale tend to imply that things can run * more * efficiently in a larger economy , not less . 
  implying that image does n't look uglier than the actual riverwood . 
  just completely ignore / u / __ circle , he 's a well-known troll . 
  indeed , op quite clearly stated that if it were only this that mattered , they would vote labor without a second thought . 
  the problem was worrying about how competent they would be . 
  that would be because it 's already been submitted . 
  curious , why would you end income taxes all the way up to $ 500k , but raise the gst ? 
  all that would do is take a fairly decent ( though flawed ) system , and make it far worse , by going from a relatively progressive system to one that is incredibly regressive . 
  professor mainstone *, 
  typo because i copy and pasted his name from the article . 
  good job op for delivering on this one . 
  do you suspect that he may have attempted to fire you * because * he thought you could be getting a promotion ? 
  perhaps to protect himself ? 
  hey , i 'm another 19 year old first-time voter . 
  to put it simply , the labor plan * is n't a tax * . 
  what they are doing is implementing a cap and trade emissions trading scheme . 
  what this means is that , once implemented \\* , an independent council will set a total nation-wide limit on how much carbon can be emitted , and permits will then be sold that allow them to pollute a certain amount . 
  then , if they are able to reduce their emissions to below the amount they paid for , they can sell it to other polluting companies . 
  this provides incentive to reduce emissions , because they can sell the permits for extra money . 
  etss are widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of reducing carbon emissions due to the way they use the power of the market , rather than purely trying to subvert the market through a pure tax . 
  the liberal 's plan is harder to describe , but yes , it does involve removing this system . 
  the liberal policy is something that they call `` direct action '' , which essentially involves giving subsidies and rewards to polluters who reduce the amount that they pollute , as well as spending money planting trees etc. 
  i must admit i do n't understand their policy fully , as it does n't seem to have been described in great detail . 
  \\* it first goes through a period of being a single fixed price without trading , in order to allow time for polluters to get used to the idea of carbon pricing . 
  that 's the stage we are at now , and that 's the reason people get confused and call it a tax . 
  perhaps , but the rate of homicide in the uk is lower than in the us , and that 's the important statistic . 
  it 's also lower in australia than in the uk , for whatever that 's worth . 
  and that 's not even counting cases like this one , firearm-related deaths that are n't homicide . 
  without guns , the number of accidental deaths not involving a motor vehicle drops to near nil . 
  hear hear, 
  edit : wait , this is n't your argument , is it ... 
  never mind . 
  whoever said it is spot on . 
  the whole gun culture in the us is fucking stupid , and it really does n't take that much thought to see why . 
  [ here 's one i found with only a quick google search ] ( http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home ) . 
  it 's got links to a number of extremely reputable sources demonstrating the risks of having guns . 
  switzerland is also ( to my knowledge ) * extremely * strict about how the guns have to be kept . 
  locked up , and ammo kept separately from the guns . 
  everything is done above board and records are kept . 
  it 's not even close to comparable to the us . 
  after the new google maps came out , it was absolutely awful , and would frequently take ages to load things , even on a good connection . 
  for me , at least , it 's all fine now , but this could be a result of that . 
  the 100 foot marker is the one pointing down , while the 20 m marker is the one pointing up . 
  if you look at it , the distance between the up and down markers is roughly 1.5 times the length of the up marker , which is the correct ratio . 
  i 'm certainly not surprised to see australia in such a high position , but i am amazed at how high up some of the other countries are . 
  in terms of the `` efficiency '' point ranking , hong kong is 92 , with a drop all the way to 82 for the next best -- singapore . 
  according to the scale op is at , if the key is correct , the entire city of adelaide is about 100 feet across . 
  there 's some sort of bug where it has n't loaded correctly . 
  yeah i was also really wondering what their metrics for working out efficiency are . 
  op 's * implication * was n't even how it came across in the actual video . 
  i 've taken it a couple of times and it places me between the greens and labor . 
  the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) is imo a much better measure of political ideology , and it tends to place me slightly to the * other * side of the greens . 
  personally i wo n't be voting 1 green , but i will preference the greens ahead of labor ( who are my preferred major party ) . 
  the most common criticism among non-trolls on / r/australia is around their policies on nuclear and gmos . 
  i 'd say those are legitimate criticisms . 
   girlfriends [ sic ] work colleague, 
  not his girlfriend , his girlfriend 's colleague . 
  no , i agree completely . 
  the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) is a much better measure of both where you place , and where the parties place , imo . 
  they 've got a page on there for the latest australian election , and it includes a fair few more parties than just these three . 
  not compatible with 10.7 ( and above , i assume ) . 
  i would assume that 's because it was never updated for intel . 
  plus they want to charge $ 20 for it . 
  they 're absolutely dreaming . 
  does anyone know how i can watch this now ? 
  ( and side note , [ the tv guide ] ( http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/brisbane/ ) says there were `` election announcement : greens '' and `` election announcement : liberals '' a while ago , are those available online ? ), 
  not at all , i just wanted to help explain it to / u/r1nce , but part of the reason he may not have understood the previous post was that there was a mistake in the previous post . 
  so pointing out that mistake helped get the correct meaning across . 
  thanks !, 
  my understanding is that acronyms are a subset of initialisms . 
   my ti-89 calculator was worth every last cent of the $ 150 i spent for it . 
  engineering students will understand why . 
  yes , i understand why , and i love my ti-84 + from high school .
