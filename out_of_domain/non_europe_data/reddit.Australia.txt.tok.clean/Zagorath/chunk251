  the bot definitely could , in theory . 
  it probably would n't even be that hard . 
  just take the text , and look for every case of ( word n , word n +1 , word n +2 ) . 
  it would then create a list of every possible combination of three consecutive words . 
  it would be massively intensive , but perhaps could be decreased slightly by excluding certain criteria . 
  for example , if the third word was a connective or article . 
  cool cool , thanks . 
  i hope you 're able to get through this intact . 
  bwv 565 is , for those who do n't know , `` bach 's '' [ toccata and fugue in d minor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fxoyr_fyfw ) . 
  ( `` bach 's '' , because many scholars today think it may not have actually been by bach . ), 
  nah , it 's neither . 
  pretty sure they 're just trolling . 
  prequel episode ? 
  which one 's that ? 
  one of the webisodes ? 
  it 's also sometimes called a kezboard , due to the z being in the place of qwerty 's y. 
  even more german sounding . 
  no because it 's buy a loaf of bread , and if they have eggs buy a dozen . 
  so he buys one loaf anyway . 
  then , if they have eggs , he buys a dozen more loaves of bread . 
  the lack of proper indentation there is annoying me ... 
  wtf is \u22a4 and \u22a5 . 
  also , ~ is a much nicer symbol to use for not . 
  is that richard nixon as in the former president of the united states ? 
  he 's actually pretty good , both the playing and the composition itself . 
  i ca n't say for certain , but i do n't think it 's quite a classical piece . 
  more likely , i 'd say , to be some sort of folk melody or popular tune . 
   the devil wears speedos #tonyabbottfilms, 
  brilliant . 
  the advantages i see of the pp over the greens are few , but important :, 
  * much larger proposed plans of overhaul of copyright , patents , and ip law, 
  * support of legalising marijuana and decriminalising other drugs, 
  * removal of religious tax exemptions ( i would have thought the greens would be in favour of this , but can find no case of them stating it ), 
  * a plan to create a full , thorough bill of rights including a number of important rights . 
  that said , they 've got disadvantages too :, 
  * they do n't support gay marriage . 
  quite . 
  what they want to do is remove government from marriage entirely , and instead replace the marriage act with a civil unions act that offers equal treatment for all couples, 
  * their environment policies are just , to be frank , wack . 
  they 're very ` green ' , but bizarre and impossible to implement on any reasonable timescale . 
  weighed up , personally i 'll probably be giving first preference to the pirate party , although the greens will be preferenced ahead of labor , too . 
  yeah , i 'm really not a fan of this . 
  she basically told us what they hope to achieve , but never said anything about how they would like to go about it . 
  probably because , exactly as you say , that would mean supporting the current unpopular policy . 
  the unfortunate truth of the matter is , though , she probably could have described in detail a cap and trade emissions trading scheme , and people are so ignorant about the current scheme they 'd probably support it as being streets ahead of the current policy . 
  except unfortunately , that is n't the reality of how voting works in your country . 
  without the preferencing system given by something like the alternative vote , a vote for a third party is at best wasted , and at worst effectively a vote for the major party you most disagree with . 
  this is called the spoiler effect , and it is n't the fault of people , it 's the fault of the system . 
   u.k. 
  just being pedantic , but the prime minister of the uk can come from any background . 
  the uk 's actual * head of state * , however , the monarch , [ has a complicated set of requirements ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buy6hgqyweq ) . 
  i 'm not really sure whether that includes being a natural citizen . 
  precisely . 
  it is n't the voters ' fault that third parties are n't successful , it 's the fptp voting system . 
  before you guys downvote this guy , consider [ poe 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe's_law ) . 
  seriously op , all it takes is a couple of backspaces to remove the `` m. '' from the front of the url . 
  sexual and romantic orientation should be based on specifically who/what you are attracted to , rather than the relation of them to you . 
  for example , rather than having heterosexual , homosexual , and bisexual , you would have `` male '' , `` female '' , and `` both male and female '' . 
  yes . 
  the `` juggler '' . 
  dvorak ( named after a person , so it 's not allcaps ) is the most hand neutral keyboard layout there is . 
  it 's got all vowels in the left hand , but the most common consonants are in the right hand . 
  typing one handed on the standard dvorak layout is extremely difficult whichever hand you choose . 
  but regarding the mouse , for certain tasks it can be important to have high accuracy . 
  gaming and graphical design are the first to spring to mind . 
  in those cases , a lefty who chooses to use his/her mouses in the right hand will be disadvantaged . 
  put a turbine next to it and attach arms to your rod that can turn the turbine . 
  you just created infinite supply of energy . 
  to our current scientific knowledge , yes . 
  agree completely . 
  i really hope you guys can get onto it . 
  it 's difficult , though , because major party politicians would have to support it , which is unlikely considering it would decrease their chances of winning . 
  still , best of luck with it . 
  if you want something like vote compass , but better , try [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) . 
  take the survey , then read the analysis page , faqs , and their australian 2013 election page . 
  also no empirical evidence , but what i would say is that the tasks performed by the mouse have lower tolerances for error . 
  if you press the wrong keyboard shortcut in photoshop , you can usually just correct it by then pressing the correct one , but being accurate with the mouse is difficult because being just a few pixels off can cause problems in some situations . 
  here , `` ha !, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv50tlkayfw&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=uukhi7m_11vjmlzsq4wnhskg ),

  i have no idea what context kg ^ 2 is relevant , but there you go . 
  thank you for mentioning average wages . 
  most people around here always bring up the fucking minimum wage as though that has this enormous effect on everything in the economy . 
  side note : holy fuck , the aussie dollar has dropped a heap . 
  only a year ago , we were sitting at up to $ 1.05 . 
  down to $ 0.89 now , this is awesome !, 
   regular 6 inches in australia start from $ 5.20, 
  no they do n't , you can get a 6-inch plus a drink for $ 5.00 with the promotion they 're running now . 
  agreed . 
  they banned qkme completely unilaterally and then never even had the balls to make a statement . 
  no information was given to us about why they did it , no access to the information that lead to the decision . 
  all we got was a vague leak through the moderators of a few large subreddits that there was some sort of vote tampering going on . 
  and then there 's python . 
  print ` hello , world ! ', 
  personally , i find `` practicing '' annoying because here we spell the verb practising . 
  but to be serious , it can be annoying hearing the same few passages over and over again , or even worse : scales . 
  as a musician myself , i would put up with it ( probably more than if they were playing loud music ) if a neighbour was doing it because i understand how important it is , but that does n't mean it is n't annoying . 
  assuming you 're not doing it at unreasonable times ( probably best to avoid from about 8:00 pm -- 10:00 am ) , i 'd say stuff them . 
  they have no right to tell you to be quiet like that . 
  i 'm no fan of her playing , but good on her for doing this .
