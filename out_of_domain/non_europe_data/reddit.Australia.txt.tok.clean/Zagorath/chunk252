  musicians , just like anyone else , deserve to be paid for their work . 
  i had no idea there was a systemic problem with musicians not paying musicians , but if there is , then good job doing everything she can to expose it and put an end to it . 
   not sure why it would go straight to kg either, 
  well it interpreted `` square ounces '' as being oz ^ ( 2 ) . 
  since ounces are a measurement of mass , i assume it decided to convert to the si units for mass , kilogrammes . 
  or , rather , kg ^ 2 , since the original units were squared . 
  mathematically it makes perfect sense , it 's just that semantically it is bizarre , since m ^ 2 is n't something that gets dealt with very often ( if * ever * ) . 
  ( edit : all i did , by the way , was put `` 137 square ounces '' into google , it returned, 
   137 ( square ounces ) =, 
  it ( along with viewing tabs from other devices ) went away for a while , but it 's back now for me . 
  are you on the main chrome stream ? 
  if so , it 's possible you just received the update that went out to the beta a while ago , and it 'll be coming back later anyway . 
  do you have a source for the inflation being * that * high ? 
  op is not a girl ( unless it was a gay wedding ), 
   it was also a very quick sprint to our waiting limo and * what is not seen in this picture * ... * is me * getting the brunt of things . 
   btw , in order to view it you 'll have to download it and open it using adobe reader . 
  in case anyone was wondering , / u/brkdbest is not derping here . 
  it 's got a lock on it so that it will * only * work in abode reader . 
  os x 's `` preview '' wo n't work , the pdf reader in chrome wo n't work , only the actual adobe software will . 
  seriously ibo , what the fuck . 
  i can understand why the australian tax office might have decided to restrict things ( they do , and i was annoyed that i had to download and install reader specifically for that ... never needed it otherwise ) , because that kind of information is sensitive so making it a little more secure might be beneficial . 
  by why the ** fuck ** do they need to make it harder for people to see the the fucking ** timetable ** for exams, 
  / off-topic rant, 
   if i ever have an internet outage and ca n't play on steam, 
  urgh fuck this . 
  how hard would it be for them to implement an offline mode that actually , you know , works offline, 
  could you clarify something for me ? 
  i know that in the us the terms prison and jail have specific , different , meanings . 
  is it the same with cop and police ? 
  he does n't know that . 
  that is ( i assume ) why he said `` even * if * his family picked a side '' ( emphasis mine ) . 
  i really enjoyed this . 
  i 'm listening to the [ first movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pimyvmfridk ) now . 
  but ... but ... there 's so much good stuff from all the other times too !, 
  you mean there 's a chance my phone can write to nfc ? 
  how does one find out if their phone has this capability ? 
  ( is there a list ? ), 
  then count yourself lucky . 
  steam 's offline mode rarely works as you would expect an offline mode to for me . 
  [ this is what i usually get ] ( http://imgur.com/ww1aurf ) when i try to use steam without an internet connection on my mac . 
  and yes , i have used steam while connected , and it will autoconnect if i have a connection . 
  wait , so can * any * phone with nfc-read ability also write to it ? 
  yeah i think that may be the case now that i 've looked into it a little more . 
  but i 'm not sure i agree with the statement `` to get any use out of nfc you need both '' . 
  the most common use for nfc i know of is tapping a tag to get information , whether it be a url ( often placed next to an ad ) , or an instruction to change a setting on the phone , or something else . 
  those are all read-only instructions , to my knowledge . 
  oh dude , massive thanks for this . 
  trying to go through it manually and work out which was which was a huge pain . 
  side note , you would n't happen to know the best viewing order for the other three seasons , would you ? 
  that look makes me think `` friend '' is more likely to mean captor , and `` helped me eat '' means `` stole '' . 
  hang on there , buddy . 
  honestly i do n't have a clue about the settings thing , i 've just heard of people setting it up so you can tap to connect to their wifi . 
  google wallet still is n't available outside the us ( or , if it is , it 's not available here ) , so that 's a completely useless point for me . 
  * ^ not ^ that ^ i 'm ^ bitter *, 
   and the right carrier, 
  i * reaaaalllyy * do n't get this . 
  carriers in the us seem to have this incredible power to control things that have ** nothing ** to do with them . 
  have an update you want pushed out ? 
  too bad , got ta wait for the carrier to accept it . 
  want to use your phone to pay for things ? 
  you 're in the right place , your phone is capable , and your bank has everything set up right for you . 
  but nope , the * carrier * gets to stop you . 
  why the fuck is this the case ? 
  how did it come to be , and how to people put up with it ? 
  honestly i thought the big carriers here were bad , but i 'm pretty sure they do n't have the power to do this shit . 
  edit : offtopic , obviously . 
  also , here we more often call them telcos , just a side-note to my off-topic rant that someone might find mildly interesting . 
  ads on posters often have an nfc tag along with a qr code that you can use to get sent to the relevant website , if you 're interested in that . 
  i think you two are using different interpretations of the term `` need to '' . 
  he 's saying how things * should * be -- that the us is acting like a bully . 
  sure it 's got power and can do these things and get away with it , but it should n't be allowed to . 
  but you 're taking the more practical point of view that for better or worse the us * does * have the power to do this without needing to consult anybody and no one is going to stop them . 
   i do n't understand why we 're pushing ahead without getting a decision from the un, 
  because the us has a history of saying fuck you un . 
  i 'm not well-versed in how security works ( a polite way of saying , i do n't know fuck about encryption ) , but could the private key not be tied to the bank account in some way ? 
  or what would be wrong with having it tied to the phone , exactly , by placing it on the nfc chip ? 
  personally , i agree fully with the pirate party in australia 's stance on patents :, 
   reduce patent terms to 5 years, 
   increase cost of obtaining software patents and remove function-based software patents ( patents on the end result of the software ) . 
   require the patent to be in use in order to litigate on it, 
  the first and last of these would apply to * all * patents , and the middle one would make software patents work much better . 
  increasing the cost means you ca n't just patent anything you think of , and requiring more code-based patents rather than function-based ones would turn patents back towards their intended purpose of driving innovation -- what you want to do is patented ? 
  oh well , better come up with a more efficient way of coding it . 
  no , you 're correct . 
  consumer film cameras can typically do 1080p , or 1920 x1080 . 
  a cheap consumer dslr , on the other , such as the d3200 , can shoot in 6016 x 4000 . 
  even a more expensive film camera can usually only do 4k , typically 4096 x 2160 . 
  what this allows you the ability to do is things like subtle zooms and pans while the camera remains perfectly still . 
  more power and control in the editing stage . 
  [ australia ] ( http://shop.coles.com.au/online/national/glad-ice-cube-bags ), 
  not satire . 
  it 's a history book . 
  if you consider these things a problem , i suggest you look into the principle of comparative advantage . 
   directly effects voting behavior, 
  affects * , though `` effects '' might also work in a place where voting is non-compulsory . 
  but as for the substance of your post , i agree completely with almost everything you stated . 
  gathering in a group and discussing policies is important , even if the people you 're with already mostly agree on things . 
  most people sadly have n't looked past abbott 's soundbites , and that is likely to come back to bite them ( pun not intended ) in the next three years . 
  asylum seekers is the only area i disagree with you on . 
  look at labor 's policy in this issue now and you 'll realise it is n't exclusively tony abbott that 's gone to the authoritarian extreme on this issue .
