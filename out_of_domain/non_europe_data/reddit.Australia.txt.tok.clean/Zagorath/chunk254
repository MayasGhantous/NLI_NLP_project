  even so , i 'm not sure how you could call that vague . 
  reduce terms to 5 years -- ca n't get more specific . 
  edit : turns out this only applies to `` innovation patents '' . 
  most patents reduced to 10 years . 
  i 'll grant you , the term `` innovation patents '' is vague . 
  remove function-based software patents -- again , specific . 
  requires patents be based on the code not on what they actually do . 
  require the patent be in use to litigate on it . 
  you ca n't sue a company for infringing on a patent you own unless you can demonstrate that a product you have on the market ( or , i would assume , currently in research ) is utilising that patent . 
  edit : [ specific wording from their policies page ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/platform#patents ) :, 
   patents on programs must reflect the uniquely dynamic nature of the software industry , and durations should be shorter than those applying to other patent types . 
  functional claiming ( which patents the end result of software ) should be abolished , as it removes the capacity for the free market to create newer and better approaches . 
  a larger fee should also apply for software patents to fund additional scrutiny and a raising of the threshold for obviousness and prior art . 
  and, 
   since patents were introduced on the basis of enabling products to be developed , we believe that legal defence of any patent should require the litigant to prove they are using it . 
  dude , spoilers . 
  ludlum has n't watched it yet . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  yeah , i really like some of these policies , especially the fair use and safe harbour areas . 
  awesome job on that . 
  but would you be open to considering something around the area of patent reform , possibly along the lines of what the pirate party proposes ( or possibly something completely new ) ? 
  ooo , i like this one . 
  which sort of proportional representation do you favour ? 
  i personally would like to see single transferable vote , where current electorates are merged in groups of 3 -- 5 . 
  as a non-smoker , i want it legalised because then it 's guaranteed to be safer ( as it can be regulated ) , and can also be taxed . 
  and sure there are other more important things , but it is a fallacy to assume that because there are more important things , one can/should * only * work on those more important things . 
  safer in that it wo n't have the potential risk for being contaminated with potentially harmful impurities . 
  but it 's mainly about the taxes . 
  edit : and also , something else that was n't on my mind at the time of writing the previous comment -- it would make it much easier for someone who has an addiction ( it might not be physically addictive , but do n't anyone pretend you ca n't get addicted to it ) to come forward and get help . 
  did anyone see the look on rudd 's face after the hostile question about small business owners being `` the enemy of the labor party '' ? 
  right after they cut to his face and before he started smiling . 
  he looked absolutely livid . 
  edit : but jesus he answered that question amazingly . 
  slavery is a natural condition . 
  brilliant job rudd !, 
  perfect way to shoot this bigot down . 
  why are stop the greens not dead last ? 
  surely a party with no purpose other than opposing you guys should be dead last ?

  is stealing the right word for it though ? 
  it 's an idea , not a tangible object . 
  but yeah , jobs was a big fan of the picasso quote `` good artists copy , great artists steal '' . 
  i love gruen . 
  their let 's invade new zealand bit was incredible . 
  sorry , musta missed that one . 
  yeah turns out that 's not accurate . 
  they want 10 years for standard patents , and 5 for `` innovation patents '' , a specifically defined class of patents by ip australia . 
  they 've also got a rather lengthy explicit elaboration of their ideas for drug patents on their policy page . 
  i skipped over that for simplicity . 
  oh fair enough . 
  interesting . 
  thanks . 
  glee i get , but where 's the reference to the big bang theory come from ? 
  it 's not a * problem * of any sort . 
  if you 've seen a post before ( and do n't like it enough to want to upvote it again ) , then downvote it . 
  if enough people have seen it before , it wo n't make it to the top page , indicating it 's lost its value and does n't deserve to make the top page . 
  this clearly has n't been seen by enough people to not make the front page , so it deserves to be here . 
  i agree with / u/zoomzoom83 . 
  i watch qanda weekly , but frequently get frustrated at how dull the questions and/or answers can be . 
  not so with this episode . 
  there were one or two questions where the questioner just went * on and on and on * ( seriously , get to the fucking ** point ** ) , but rudd answered every single one of them amazingly well , and the questions ' content was mostly really good ( once you got past the waffle ) . 
  strongly recommend watching this on iview . 
  who is the ipa ? 
  i only know that initialism to be short for international phonetic alphabet , which i gather is n't what you 're talking about . 
  i completely agree with you and i 'm not happy with how the top comment is trivialising this issue . 
  but i really wish you would stop talking about the `` to the exclusion of all others '' amendment . 
  it 's completely irrelevant here . 
  that simply means marriage is between two , and only two , people . 
  if you amended it to remove the `` man and a woman '' , you could leave in the `` exclusion of all others '' part and it would then allow for gay marriages . 
  ah ok , thanks . 
  and what is it that they ostensibly do ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  i do n't see anu in the top 10 on any of the three top google results for `` world university rankings '' . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com ) also has break downs for its rankings of a number of different subjects , and anu is n't in the top 10 for any of them . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012 ) places it the highest i could find , at 24th , while [ times ] ( http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking ) puts it at 37th , below melbourne ( 28th ) . 
  yes, 
  i googled that and the top result was `` international amateur radio union '' . 
  i 'm going to pretend that 's what they belong to . 
  ( then i looked at the result below and realised that it 's actually `` international alliance of research universities '' , which is exactly what you wrote . ), 
  oh thanks . 
  i do n't know why , i got the impression it was a government body . 
  the question argued that a certain law should be upheld in a certain manner specifically because the bible said so . 
  pointing out the logical inconsistencies of that argument ( in the form of showing something in the bible that nobody today would support ) is a valid way of debating that claim . 
  $ 67.90 holy ** shit ** man , did you really just give him that much ? 
  how do you actually use bitcoin from the bitcointip bot ? 
  like , how does it get transferred to your bitcoin account ? 
  and what if the person you tipped does n't have an account ? 
  the liberal one . 
  urgh i 'm just fed up with java in general . 
  ca n't get java applets on the web to work , ca n't get minecraft to run without giving some sort of message about a lack of proper java . 
  it 's just fucking useless . 
  oh yeah i get what you 're saying . 
  we 're all stuck with it in some form or other . 
  might help people diagnose the problem if you specified which os you 're on , and what version of chrome .
