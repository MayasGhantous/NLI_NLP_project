  well , as a matter of fact , the kilogramme is defined by the mass of a specific piece of platinum/iridium located in france . 
  there are a number of copies of this , sent to different countries , and [ the mass of many of them actually are increasing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:prototype_mass_drifts.jpg ) . 
  very cool !, 
  side note , anyone got a video of the loading animation on ipad ? 
  ( i wan na compare it . ), 
  wow , very specific . 
  awesome fun , though . 
  there are probably subreddits specific to filmmaking that you might want to crosspost this to . 
  very good points , and it 's worth noting that i made a mistake about the 5 year patent term . 
  what they want is a 10 year patent term for most patents , and 5 year for `` innovative patents '' , which is a [ specifically defined subclass by ip australia ] ( http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/get-the-right-ip/patents/types-of-patents/innovation-patent/ ) . 
  i 'd recommend reading their specific policies , as they do have a rather extensive description of their policies and reasoning for policies regarding pharmaceutical patents . 
  ( and also the specific area of gene patents is mentioned . ), 
  regarding the international issue , my understanding is that the treaties actually tend to work the other way : they tend to uphold the shortest time . 
  [ here is their page on patent policies ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/patents ) . 
  you can get back to their page on policies in general ( which includes an overview of their patent policies as well ) [ here ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/platform ) . 
  also , it 's worth reading their full policies regarding pharmaceutical patents [ on this page ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/patents ) . 
  from above :, 
  i dunno , i 'd say it 's important to know your senator wo n't sit on the fence over important issues . 
  it 's worse than that . 
  the pay rate differences are somewhat relevant . 
  they always bring up the fucking minimum wage , as though like 90 % of the population gets that ... 
  to be fair , a few months ago assuming aud = usd was pretty accurate . 
  it was sitting at between 0.98 and 1.05 for a long time . 
  yup , completely illegal . 
  however , i doubt there 's enough evidence of them doing it to take them to court . 
  i 've been using http://senate.io/, 
  do n't fret too much over who goes last . 
  your preferences will never get there , unless both labor and liberal are among your last votes . 
  ( my plan is to work out specifically who goes in which preference up until labor , then have some sort of vague idea until it gets to liberal , and then just completely gut feel until the end . ), 
  i partly agree . 
  they do need to fix the above the line preference deals that go on in the senate . 
  people should n't have their votes go somewhere they do n't agree just because the party preferenced nonsensically ( asp going to one nation is a prime example ) . 
  but we could really do with single transferable vote in the reps as well , because the house of representatives as it currently stands is n't representative of people 's actual votes . 
  so if someone with a bitcoin wallet in the system tries to tip someone who has never used bitcoin , it will just ignore the request ? 
  does that mean / u/hardleft121 's tips above probably did n't do anything ? 
  there are a number of reasons to be interested in global news . 
  from a completely utilitarian standpoint , things can affect your views . 
  for example , seeing how a particular event affected one country could affect something similar in your country . 
  mentions of the fukushima or chernobyl plants are often brought up when discussing nuclear power in discussions in australia , for example . 
  or how a particular economic or social decision by the government had on-flowing effects could influence your own decisions on how to vote in your country . 
  if i see that country a took austerity measures and its economy suffered severely in the recession , while country b stimulated its economy , and did better , then i may be more likely to vote for a left-wing government in my own country : one more likely to implement stimulus should my country hit hard economic times . 
  something in syria is likely to affect global oil prices , which you can bet will affect you . 
  but even from a less utilitarian standpoint , being an educated person in general is a good thing . 
  discussions of international issues can be incredibly stimulating mentally , and if you are ignorant of these issues , it means you can never possibly have this sort of discussion . 
  living in ignorance might be bliss , but it certainly is n't a good way to live as a citizen of the world . 
  ah right , cheers . 
  can confirm . 
  1994 here , just started my second semester at uni ( and most people born in 1994 here would be starting their fourth semester : second semester of second year ) . 
  what was the original ? 
  there does n't seem to be any link to it in the comments here . 
  sure , downvote if you want , not like it makes all that much difference . 
  but i 'd like to point out that on comments , downvoting should be regulated by reddiquette . 
  you should n't downvote things you disagree with , only things which are irrelevant to the conversation . 
  i think below the line lets you do that , too . 
  i preferred senate.io because its interface just felt easier to use , and i like the option of the ballot view . 
  it explicitly states `` search for duplicates before posting '' , which op clearly did . 
  that he failed to find things even though they did exist is n't his fault . 
  yeah the reps voting ticket was a major plus . 
  i used them just for that , but will use senate.io for the senate . 
  [ non-murdoch source ( and also the official uni 's statement ) ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=26661 ) . 
  as someone who only watched it ( the entire show , not the season ) a few months ago , i was surprised to discover that season four is disliked so much . 
  i really do n't see anything wrong with it or how it is different at all . 
  my high school had this policy on school trips , and it seems reasonable there . 
  but i take it that this is about staying on campus at uni ? 
  that 's just absurd . 
  you guys are adults , surely you can make your own decisions ? 
  there 've been two leap years since : 2008 , 2012 . 
  / u/perverse _ psychology already accounted for one leap year . 
  7 * 365 is 2555 , so with two leap years it 's 2557 . 
  no worries , easy mistake to make . 
  yeah sure , if it 's not too much effort to go to to satisfy a stranger 's passing interest :p, 
  not quite * anyone * . 
  if they are in a ` position of trust ' , e.g. 
  a teacher or carer , it 's still not legal . 
  no , single transferable vote is a method for getting proportional representation in a multi-member election . 
  it 's how the senate is currently elected , with 6 winners per state . 
  if they used it in reps as well , they could decrease the number of electorates ( by merging them into groups of 3 or 4 ) and have each electorate produce multiple members . 
  [ this video explains ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blh_w5khjpa ) . 
  it might not always happen in practice , i would n't know , but the law clearly states that someone in a position of trust can not have sex with someone in their care and under 18 . 
  the official long title of the `` sexual offences ( amendment ) act 2000 '' is :, 
   an act to ... make it an offence for a person aged 18 or over to engage in sexual activity with or directed towards a person under that age if he is in a position of trust in relation to that person ... ^ [ [ source ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/44/introduction ) ], 
  the term for that is flanderised , from flanders in the simpsons . 
  and i must say i never noticed that myself while watching it through -- or , not any more than seemed to be happening through the third season as well -- but i definitely plan to keep an eye out for it when i rewatch the show . 
  shut up . 
  nobody asked for * science * . 
  uhh , yeah ... ? 
  of course there is ... 
  i do n't think they are , really . 
  i think that this was created specifically to reinforce pro-labor beliefs in those already supporting labor . 
  and there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  i do n't think this pamphlet is * trying * to get people to change their minds . 
  it 's made to pander to those that already despise abbott and the liberal party . 
  and it does a great job at that . 
  hey dude , nothing wrong with pedantry . 
  we already specified we 're talking about the uk . 
  it serves exactly the same function , just with a much nicer interface . 
  you can look at the interface exactly the same as it would be on the ballot paper , or with a nicer drag and drop list . 
  disadvantage is it does n't do the reps. 
  looks like what we called handball when i was growing up . 
  ( not to be confused with the competitive sport team handball , which is completely different . ),
