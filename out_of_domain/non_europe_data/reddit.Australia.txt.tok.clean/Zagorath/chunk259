  and , since these people probably do a lot of typing for a living , they probably have a higher chance of using dvorak . 
  still , accidental or not , it probably was accurate . 
  i agree completely . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the main branch of libertarianism is extremely right wing . 
  to go by the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) 's nomenclature , libertarians are ` libertarian ' on social issues , and right wing on economic policies . 
  i agree with you , libertarians have great policies in social areas . 
  it 's their ` hands off ' approach to the economy that gets me seriously worried . 
  a referendum , which would likely fail ( given the ridiculous requirements for a referendum to pass ) , would set back the cause for many years to come . 
  a failed referendum would be seen as strong indication that australia does not want marriage equality , and that therefore politicians have no right to be bringing it up . 
  it is n't about reality , it 's about * perception * of reality , as portrayed by the liberal campaign and murdoch attack ads . 
  according to the majority of the population , labor failed on the economy and other areas . 
  they majority of the population might be empirically wrong , but that does n't matter . 
  to be fair , we did get swan back in in lilley . 
  right wing is , by definition , about minimum government intervention in the economy . 
  read the link i gave about the political compass . 
  good point . 
  huh , cool . 
  i was fully expecting fresh to take the lead because of a spoiler effect on those who do n't like fresh . 
  if the early vote count is anything to go by , i guess that was way off . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  ok let 's start off by clarifying some things . 
  avatar is ** not ** an anime . 
  it 's an american cartoon that takes some visual and thematic ideas from asian culture . 
  not even that much japan specifically , much more from china in terms of culture . 
  now , i just happen to be a ** huge ** fan of the show , and the main reason is that it is an incredibly complex show . 
  i really do n't want to spoil it for you in case you do watch it , but none of the characters are completely good or evil , they all have reasons for how they behave , and we get to see why they act how they act . 
  there is some enormous character development on a number of characters , including brilliant use of foil between some of the major characters , which helps emphasise the differences between them in a fantastic way . 
  relations between characters are equally complex , with perhaps one of the most effective and engaging fictional romances i 've come across , and also really nuanced non-romantic relations that get explored in a pretty decent depth . 
  the show , despite being ostensibly for children , explores some * incredibly * dark themes , and does so very effectively . 
  again , i do n't want to spoil anything , but there are themes involving genocide , torture , mental insanity , mind control ( in a way ) , as well as at least one other that i ca n't describe in a general way without outright spoilers . 
  the music is fantastic , there 's not really much more to say about this . 
  it makes clever use of motifs being associated with themes and characters in the show , in a way that makes me ( as a fan of classical and film music ) really excited . 
  it also extensively uses one of my favourite instruments , the duduk -- something you 've never heard of before , but [ almost certainly have heard ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd5jo69redy ) . 
  that 's just a side note of random interest , though . 
  i could go on , but it 's difficult without getting into spoiler territory . 
  the show is n't one that 's in dire need of support ( in the way that , say community is ) , so you would n't be doing too much harm by obtaining the show in less than legitimate manner . 
  i 'd strongly recommend downloading it and watching the first few episodes ( at 20 min each , you could get through the first three in an hour ) . 
  if you 're not it by then , then you probably wo n't be , and you wo n't have lost too much time or money , so there 's not much lost . 
  edit : [ this post on r/thelastairbender ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/1ly8ng/im_a_24_year_old_man_who_has_no_particular/ ) does n't have much high quality content , but does contain people who seem to have previously been in much the same situation as you , who watched it and came to love it . 
  but be mindful of the rules of the subreddit , we cherish the high quality of discussion in that subreddit . 
  so make sure do not be rude and do n't leave low effort joke comments . 
  no , but you do need a shitty pm for others to realise how correct you are when you do it . 
  i was depressed when i looked at the map and found brisbane was one of only two capital cities that did n't have a left-leaning party hold the city centre . 
  melbourne greens , hobart had a left-wing independent , darwin being the only other one where lnp ( or lnp-related parties ) are in power . 
  urgh i hate my state ... 
  ( but hey , winning soo and not having daylight saving are cool !, 
  plus the weather 's much better here , so i guess it 's not all bad ... ), 
  we do . 
  the accepted way of implementing an ets is to first have a period of time with a fixed carbon price to allow polluters time to adapt . 
  this is so true , but unfortunately most of reddit loves to hate on apple at any given chance , so it will largely fall on deaf ears . 
  we 're still already fucked over with the nbn , which he does n't need senate support to fuck up . 
  / r/savethenbn, 
  op 's one has far more supporters , and is far more detailed . 
  i say we put our effort into backing that one . 
  i 'm getting fucking sick of people complaining about the people complaining about people calling out others for circle jerking ? 
  i had never heard of it before either . 
  i thought it was something about trucks ... 
   it depends how you define `` left-wing '' and `` right-wing '' . 
  this is accurate . 
  personally , i advocate for the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) 's method of classifying political beliefs . 
  left and right wing are economic policies , where left wing involves government intervention to fix up negative externalities in the market , while right wing is government stepping back and allowing the free market to run in a more efficient way without intervention . 
  authoritarian and ` libertarian ' ( not to be confused with the libertarian ideology ) are the social scale , where libertarian is where people are free to do as they want , and authoritarian is the opposite . 
  traditional libertarians would be right wing libertarian according to this , while at the opposite end , communism is left wing authoritarian . 
  the greens are left wing libertarian , while liberals are right wing authoritarian . 
  it 's convention , but it 's not required . 
  we have even had a pm from the senate before . 
  i would n't mind swan , but i doubt it . 
  too much baggage from the gillard government . 
  lived in korea for a while , and i can confirm 1 and 3 . 
  point 2 , however , fuck no . 
  i feel like that would work much better with korra , on account of the whole equalist movement . 
  qld here , same laws . 
  at that point i was specifically discussing the really adult themes that give the show a darker edge to it , so yeah , honour 's an important theme , but does n't really fit in that particular assessment . 
  no , more like hilbert 's paradox , which is a veridical paradox -- one that creates an absurd-seeming conclusion from a perfectly valid argument . 
  and it is perfectly valid , so it does work . 
  the only reason it does n't work is that infinite money is a pointless concept anyway . 
  just spending an unlimited amount of money to one charity would not in itself cause hyperinflation . 
  the problem would come if either you or the charity went on and started spending millions of dollars in the wider economy , which we just have to hope you do n't do . 
  just having unlimited money does n't mean you have to ruin the economy . 
  just do n't start buying millions of dollars worth of stuff and your impact will be negligible . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it only does those things if you actually * spend * ridiculous amounts of money . 
  just having it wo n't change a thing . 
  so , get unlimited money , spend it in a non-ridiculous way ( buy a couple of houses , a couple of nice cars , and some cool gadgets , but do n't go buying up whole cities worth of property , or shouting a lifetime supply of high-speed unlimited internet to the entire country ) , and everything will be fine . 
  as much as i like how he spoke there , i ca n't help but cringe at dorothy dixers ... they 're just so awful . 
  fun fact , that expression is a corruption of the expression `` the proof of the pudding is in the eating '' , which sounds really weird when you 're used to the shortened version , but makes a heap more sense when you think about it ... 
  huh ? 
  i never made the argument about hyper inflation . 
  in fact , i 've been going around correcting other people who made it . 
  but the comment you replied to never even approaches that point . 
  proportional is great , but mmp is awful . 
  institutionalising parties and giving them the power to choose who gets in parliament rather than voters is a terrible idea . 
  what we need is stv . 
  take current electorates and group them into groups of 3 -- 5 , with 3 -- 5 members elected from each using much the same algorithm currently used in the senate . 
  that will give us a proportional system without this awful giving of power directly to parties . 
   i ca n't help but be a little cynical when discussions of overhauling the electoral system begin the day after an election where reddit 's preferred party lost . 
  i 've been commenting about the merits of proportional representation for a long time . 
  i 'm also staunchly * against * the system used in new zealand because of the power it gives to parties rather than voters . 
  i prefer stv as a way to elect members in the reps.
