  for me it mainly just makes a noise when i fold my case back -- i have my gocard , debit card , and uni student card in there , all of which have little nfc ( or nfc-like ) chips . 
  edit : i also once tapped it up against an ad at a bus stop just for the hell of it . 
  i did n't even care to find more about the actual ad , just wanted to try out nfc . 
   that whoever inherited australia in 2007 inherited a coming economic collapse in globalised trade that would suck australia and much of the rest of the world down with it . 
  not quite every prediction . 
  sure we did n't get completely sucked down by it , but the party about the world 's economic collapse was accurate , and it certainly did n't leave us unscarred . 
  indeed , perhaps were it not for the global financial crisis , the swing back against labor would n't have been so bad . 
  slightly off-topic , but you guys do n't get a public holiday for boxing day ? 
  can i just say , thank you so much for doing this , and congratulations on the incredible result !, 
  you should consider heading over to / r/australia or / r/australianpolitics . 
  they 're much larger subreddits than this one . 
  except that most likely in this scenario there would n't * be * a job paying $ 5 an hour because everyone could get away with paying less . 
  and you 'd be forced to work for less because the alternative is not working at all . 
  and no , the reality is that if you make $ 5 an hour ( in a world without minimum wage ) , that 's because that is the smallest amount that the business thinks it can get away with paying while still retaining enough workers to get the job done . 
  the simple fact is people need to be able to afford a decent living wage . 
  if you do n't like it , then you and the other libertarians can go form your own little colony , i 'm sure you 'll do great . 
  if people ca n't afford a decent living wage , then they ca n't live a healthy and safe life . 
  they need to be able to afford food , and housing , and transport to and from wherever they work . 
  and , if they do want to better themselves , they 'll need to pay for that education or training . 
  in your world , they would n't be able to do that , because their employers would n't be paying them nearly enough to do that . 
  you can turn it off by going to system preferences -  software update and unchecking `` automatically check for updates '' . 
  it 's probably not even the os . 
  all app store apps get updated through that same menu , so it could be anything . 
  personally i like it as a concept , but would * never * want them to have more than two or three senate seats . 
  great if they hold balance of power , but to be a significant force of their own , no thanks . 
  god this article is awful . 
  not the slant ( well , that too ) , but the actual writing . 
  we do n't have ` regions ' in australia , we have states . 
  clearly very little actual research went into it . 
  you do n't have a `` fifth of sixth seats '' , that 's just grammatically wrong . 
  the explanation of stv is difficult to follow even for someone who already knows how it works . 
  it would be utterly useless trying to explain it to someone from the uk unfamiliar with it . 
  the term independent really does n't apply . 
  he very specifically is from a party , the liberal democratic party , to be precise . 
  and there were a few other minor grammatical errors . 
  i find it hard to take them seriously when they do n't even bother researching their topics , or writing in a logical and correct manner . 
  if it was up again a while ago , it 's down now , and has been for at least the last 10 minutes . 
  * faster download speeds, 
  * much faster upload speeds, 
  * better for small businesses , medicine , and education, 
  * lower maintenance, 
  * lower future upgrade costs, 
   if my glandular fever goes away i 'm planning on riding my bike there . 
  however until then , i do n't have enough cash on hand to buy a scooter/bike right now, 
  that 's from the same comment where he said he 's in toowong . 
  but i agree , the bicentennial bikeway is incredible . 
  agree completely . 
  samsung puts a whole load of ** crap ** on their devices , and htc is n't much better . 
  the nexus 4 is ridiculously cheap for the incredible power you get , and it was recently made $ 100 cheaper . 
  and yeah , the rumours are that the nexus 5 will be out very shortly ( supposedly one was spotted -- possibly planted , possibly by accident -- in the android kit-kat ad/announcement video/thing ) , so it may be worth waiting to see . 
  moto-x is supposedly going to get upgrades very quickly , but it wo n't be as fast as nexus . 
  should n't we be expecting a 6th gen soon ? 
  unless they do what they did with the 4th gen and keep the previous gen hardware for two years . 
   and nobody needs 32 gigs . 
  fuck that . 
  i only have 16 gb on my nexus 4 , and it 's a huge pain . 
  previously i had a 32 gb ipod touch 3rd gen , and i had all of my music on it , a heap of apps , and a few videos . 
  on my n4 , after apps are taken into account , i 've only got enough room for such a small collection of music i decided just to delete the whole lot of it anyway . 
   we have androids , a pain to swap . 
  idevices ? 
  just wipe the old and sync the new . 
  now , i 've never actually tried switching to a new phone on either ios or android , but i do n't think this is accurate . 
  the majority of important stuff on android is kept through your google account . 
  email , calendar , contacts , apps , and potentially music , books , and movies as well . 
  i do n't see any reason that ios would necessarily be better at that by any significant margin . 
  ah thanks . 
  i was also wondering what these things were for . 
  i still ca n't see it ... 
  oh you poor thing . 
  i use the dvorak keyboard layout , and we have it * much * worse . 
  some games seem to automatically switch over to qwerty so no change is needed ( if you use wasd , anyway ) , which is awesome . 
  but then some games do n't do this , which means you have to go through and rebind * every * , * single * , * key * . 
  and then some games randomly just wo n't work at all unless you 're in qwerty , which means you have to remember to switch keyboard layouts before opening the game . 
  ( but seriously , despite the passive aggressiveness above , i really do feel your pain ... games should have keyboard bindings presets for at the very least wasd qwerty , feds qwerty , and wasd dvorak . ), 
  i typically prefer control for crouch , but having recently started playing half-life ( where the jump crouch thing is important ) i found myself needing to switch it to c. pressing spacebar with my thumb and then c with my second finger is much easier than thumb then 5th finger . 
  padawans have patients ? 
  remind me not to have a padawan for my doctor . 
  hmm , i find it particularly interesting that you have the forwards key * in line * with the strafe keys , and the backwards key is the one shoved down below . 
  considering you typically go forward a lot more often than backward , that seems as though it would be a lot more comfortable . 
  would n't easily work for asdx , because of the direction the keys are spaced in , but with a numpad ( or if you used jkl , in the right hand ) it would be really handy ( pun not intended ) . 
  i get this too , although not because i use my computer left handed ( though i am a left-leaning ambidextrous ) , but because my keyboard layout is dvorak . 
  the way it always goes is they 'll pull up the web browser and type something in , and press enter . 
  be surprised at the result , and try again , before getting really confused and i have to explain it to them . 
  the vast majority do n't , in fact . 
   yeah macbook pro 's have good keyboards in general, 
  i hear this a lot , from * a lot * of people , but i really do n't get it . 
  do n't get me wrong , i * love * my macbook pro , and i 'm typing this from it , but i ca n't stand the apple keyboards . 
  the touchpad , on the other hand , if ** godly ** . 
  i played portal 1 and 2 on it , and i 'm currently going through half-life . 
  it 's the only touchpad that 's useable for gaming in any serious way , not to mention being * better * than a mouse for common tasks like browsing the web . 
  [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/kb_united_states_dvorak.svg/400px-kb_united_states_dvorak.svg.png ) . 
  it 's an alternate keyboard layout designed specifically for faster typing , higher accuracy , and lower rates of rsis than the qwerty keyboard , which was designed specifically to prevent common key combinations from being near each other and easy to type . 
  worth noting that i have n't switched the keys on my keyboard around , so to look at the physical keyboard it 's exactly the same as normal , but then when you press a key you do n't get what you expect . 
  wait , it 's 13 + light days away from earth now ? 
  holy shit ... 
  of course . 
  thanks . 
  fun fact , the word coup is french for hit or strike . 
  fuck it , i do n't care if the media does n't call them out on the backflip . 
  i just want our country to have internet that 's good for the future .
