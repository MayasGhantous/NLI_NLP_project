  let the liberals take credit for it , what 's important is getting the infrastructure . 
  you have a total lack of understanding of how elections you . 
  people vote for the party that they agree * most * with . 
  they may or may not agree with every policy , and they have the right to voice their opinion in either case . 
  well would n't that mean that if the signals only just got back , then it was n't last august ? 
  ah fair enough . 
  glad they 're doing that . 
  it 's incredibly easy . 
  it probably took me two months to reach an equal typing speed to my qwerty and then one month after that i had an average of 20 wpm higher than my previous average . 
  i wrote up a set of tips/instructions for anyone considering switching , which also includes links to sites with more information about the advantages of it [ here ] ( http://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) . 
  also consider popping over to / r/dvorak . 
  the us should standardise its equivalent of gst/vat . 
  this `` states ' rights '' bullshit is stupid and counterproductive . 
  i actually completely agree with your previous statement , but / u/subarash has a fair point . 
  `` they '' does n't refer to all wait staff , it refers to any wait staff who behave in the manner you described . 
   we ca n't use it on anyone but third world countries . 
  if we tried to invade anyone that we could n't conquer in a week they 'd nuke us and we 'd nuke them and that would be that . 
  can i just say that while i agree with most of your points , i 'm not so sure i agree with this . 
  you seem to be making the assumption that all non-third-world countries have nukes . 
  they do n't . 
  only 5 countries are permanent members of the unsc . 
  there are a handful of other countries with nukes , but those are mainly developing countries . 
  then there are a few countries that are involved in nuclear weapon sharing through nato . 
  but that still leaves a lot of major countries with no nuclear at all . 
  if you think all the blue and yellow countries [ in this graph ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:nwfz.svg ) are ` third world countries ' , then you may be missing something . 
  still , your general point is very valid . 
  just nitpicking . 
  the minimum wage has been $ 10.25 since 2010 , and since it would presumably be increased ( if it is increased ) in 2014 , that means there have been 4 years in between . 
  according to [ this site ] ( http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/ ) , if you go from 2009 to 2013 ( since it would n't let me do 2010 -- 2014 -- this should work as a close proxy ) $ 10.25 is $ 11.00 . 
  this decreases the significance of the wage increase by a rather large amount , although still does n't account for it fully . 
  this does n't refute your point in and of itself , but when taken in combination with / u/usrname42 's excellent post , it significantly increases the power of his post . 
  i understand what you 're saying , and all your points are more or less valid , except mainly for the points described by / u/a _ mirror . 
  however , i do n't think any of it is relevant to what you term `` american exceptionalism '' . 
  the us ranks below a lot of other countries in various types of international rankings , such as the [ education index ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) , where it is 13 , the [ who health systems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_health_organization_ranking_of_health_systems ) , [ intentional homicide rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country ) , with a score of 4.8 -- the same as thailand , and worse than palestine , india , iran , iraq , canada , the uk , and australia . 
  people in the us far more than any other developed country can be utterly destroyed financially by unavoidable health problems , due to the lack of quality healthcare . 
  the quality of education can be unreliable at best where it is far from unheard of that people will be taught creationism as science , and/or not taught the prevailing theory of evolution . 
  america has not yet introduced marriage equality , as many other western countries are starting to do . 
  it one of only 5 developed nations to still use the death penalty , and the only western one . 
  it can be applied for non-violent crimes like drug-trafficking , and even sometimes it is applied to minors . 
  so sure , the us may be a powerful nation , but it 's certainly not a place i would like to be from . 
  exceptional ? 
  perhaps , but not in a good way . 
  touch typing bitch . 
  learn it . 
  now if only i could find the `` submit '' button . 
  hang on , let me ca / / my roommate . 
  edit : not bad , only one mistake . 
  i 'm happy with that . 
  personally i would n't get a gaming laptop , but i agree entirely . 
  asus all the way if you do want one . 
  razer and alienware are just complete overpriced rip-offs . 
  i 'm all about the sleek mbp for a laptop and a custom gaming desktop rig , though . 
  i really hope jurassic world does n't ruin this aspect of the previous films . 
   so probably a finnish guy and probably a drunk one . 
  now , i 'm not from the region , but from what i 've heard this is pretty much a tautology . 
   i also emailed this, 
  if there 's one thing i learned from reading about american politics on reddit , it 's that this was n't necessarily the best choice . 
  a physical dead-tree letter would have been better . 
  this is absolutely brilliantly worded . 
  extremely professional , extremely accurate , and very clearly shows the flaws in their system . 
  i hope he does read it , and it would be even better if he responded . 
  in the unlikely chance he does , please share the response with us . 
  first , here 's a copy paste from another thread which addresses a similar issue . 
   i understand what you 're saying , and all your points are more or less valid , except mainly for the points described by / u/a _ mirror . 
   however , i do n't think any of it is relevant to what you term `` american exceptionalism '' .

  exceptional ? 
  perhaps , but not in a good way . 
  now , for some other bits more directly tailored to your issue . 
  gdp is a useless measure of how good a country is . 
  you need to be using per capita to be worth anything . 
  in that , the us ranks [ 7th ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita ) . 
  and even that is a poor measure of how well off people are . 
  the us has awful inequality . 
  sort [ this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) by gini to see it below pakistan , east timor , and ethiopia , among others . 
  using [ inequality-adjusted hdi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) ( my preferred measurement ) , you see the us drop from 3rd to 16th . 
  in charitable giving , the [ us is ranked 5th ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_giving_index ) , not bad , but certainly not world leading . 
  the us also has more people in gaol than the next few countries * combined * , with by far the highest proportion of people . 
  i do n't think that 's the mark of a great country at all . 
  regarding the nobel laureates , that certainly is a great achievement that should not be scoffed at , but it does n't tell the whole story . 
  the us also has by far the largest population of any developed country . 
  the next developed nation down has * half * of it . 
  based on those odds , i do n't think the us 's achievement is * quite * as incredible . 
  still very good , but not * as * good . 
  so glad to see / r/savethenbn on this list . 
  any australians reading this should head on over there . 
  we ca n't let the liberals ruin our chance at good , fast , reliable internet going forward . 
  where the hell did the results of this spreadsheet come from ? 
  i mean , i agree with it and everything , but i certainly do n't ever remember taking part in a large scale survey of my opinion on it . 
  i 'm not really sure that senate results are any more of a mandate than reps are . 
  you do n't need google to answer that question . 
  the answer is none . 
  they have to write our the fingerings above their notes . 
  yes , but in our case it was n't because ` we ' thought they were pure , but because ` we ' thought it would help provide them with a better upbringing and allow them to become more successful people .
