  as well as many other shorter run comics . 
  that 's without even beginning to mention the multitude of cross-overs he 's involved in . 
  and if you want to understand the cross-overs , then you 'll need to read the backstories of the other characters being crossed over . 
  you can see how this is starting to become difficult , no ? 
  but i do n't see why you should have to do all that in order to call yourself a fan . 
  there are already numerous tv shows and movies about the character spiderman , and if you 've watched them and love the character , then why ca n't you call yourself a fan ? 
  being a fan is primarily about loving the character . 
  in all of these , the character is fundamentally the same . 
  he got to where he is today for the same reason , his powers are more or less the same , and the way he goes about his business is more or less the same . 
  spiderman , for example , got his power by being bitten by a spider , he can crawl on walls , has much higher than average strength and senses , and he can shoot webs -- in different stories either as a power or by a contraption of his design , that bit is n't quite so important . 
  he 's a pacifist at heart and tries to save the day while doing minimal damage , compared to other heroes , anyway . 
  that is spiderman 's character , and if you love that , you 're a fan of spiderman , even if all you 've seen is the latest movie , or if you 've only read one brief story arc in one of the comics . 
  as a fan of the character , you will likely want to find out more , and will seek out more of the media , but this is not a given and is not necessary . 
  i get it , freestyle/australia crawl / ` frontstroke ' ( an odd name , ca n't say i 've heard that one before ) is faster and uses less energy . 
  but butterfly just looks and feels ** so much cooler ! ** . 
  / off-topic rant, 
  but whose fault is that ? 
  if two drunk people have sex , and * one * of them feels bad about it afterwards , but the other does n't , can you call it rape ? 
  can you seriously consider putting the other person in gaol or attaching the label of `` sex offender '' to them for life just because they had sex with someone that was drunk . 
  they * thought * the person was consenting , it certainly * seemed * as though they were consenting . 
  would you call that rape ? 
  yes , `` something is n't right '' , that 's absolutely true , but that thing is the bad choices of the person who got drunk . 
  that 's not to say every case of sex involving alcohol should be fine . 
  if one person is intentionally getting the other person drunk in order to lower their inhibitions and to get them to have sex , well that 's not okay , and that * should * be labelled rape . 
   some people think that dressing provocatively equals consent, 
  does anyone * actually * think this , in that exact form ? 
  i definitely agree that there are too many people who would argue that by dressing provocatively they `` deserved '' it , but i do n't think they would explicitly call it consent . 
  either way it 's an incredibly misguided viewpoint , but i still think it 's a subtlety worth getting right . 
  businesses get special treatment , why should unions not , too ? 
  i get that you probably do n't think businesses should either , but let 's accept the premise that they currently do . 
  to balance that , do you not think it right that unions should as well ? 
  i do n't know about other places , but i recently heard that around here there are very few kids put up for adoption . 
  adopting a kid is therefore really , really hard . 
  if gay adoptions were banned here , then there would indeed by more straight adoptions . 
  i do n't personally view this as a necessarily good thing , and so i do n't think it should be banned , but if it were , that would be the result . 
  well , even if you accept op 's premise ( i do n't ) , you could still claim to be a fan of marvel 's thor after reading the thor comics . 
  fair point , although i 'd wager most people who adopt probably do so within their own local area . 
  i 'm not actually trying to make a point here , by the way , just trying to shed light on what other people are saying . 
  yeah . 
  this is an actually led screen , * not * an led-backlit lcd screen , which is what you get if you walk into your local jb hi-fi ( or whatever your local equivalent is ) and see a tv advertised as led . 
  but then if they are both drunk , how do you decide which is the `` rapist '' ? 
  it 's absurd to say that just because one person was upset about a bad decision they made , it must have been rape . 
  if one drunk person can give consent , then so can the other . 
  the * legal * definition of what 's rape is n't what is being discussed here , it 's what * should * be viewed as rape . 
  by the way , the word you 're looking for is cognisant . 
  the description should clear things up . 
  yeah sorry , that would definitely be a better word to use . 
  yes , i would say a devoted fan would have to have read a significant amount of the comics . 
  i would also say , however , that they should have seen a significant amount of tv episodes and movies . 
  to be a devoted fan you should have seen a significant portion of all the media produced about your fan subject . 
  yes characters change from author to author , but that change is present between different comic writers as well as different movies or shows . 
  the fundamentals stay the same , though , and that 's what 's important . 
  ** you do n't have to be knowledgeable to be a fan ** . 
  i think that 's the important point that you 're missing here . 
  they are two completely unrelated things . 
  a fan just loves the character and situations it gets into , but does n't necessarily have to go more in depth with a lot if research . 
  now , i would say most fans * would * want to go into more depth and find out more , but there 's no reason they should have to , because that 's not what being a fan means . 
  how does one use cancer to bully someone ? 
  i would n't call that the bigger reason . 
  you kinda need both . 
  if he had come in expecting them to play a standard four chord song it probably woulda been doable . 
  with time to practise beforehand , he could 've become familiar with the chord changes enough to be able to do it . 
  false analogy . 
  people hate on ea for doing things that are bad of gamers and the gaming industry . 
  valve has n't done anything particularly bad . 
  about the worst thing they 've got is offline mode in steam , which is crap , but not that big a deal . 
  it hardly ever works how one would expect . 
  you should be able to turn on your computer , open steam , turn it into offline mode , and play offline games , all while you have no internet connection . 
  because that 's the case that you 're going to need offline mode in . 
  but you ca n't , unless you put it in offline mode first before closing it last time . 
  completely useless if your internet goes out . 
  i do n't honestly know . 
  all i know is i have not once got offline mode to work when i needed it to , including fairly recently . 
  it 's only a win if you convert to the enlightened . 
  romeo and juliet stories never end well for anybody . 
  that 's one game , i imagine there are probably others . 
  i vaguely remember seeing something about one on the wii . 
  it 's not a sonata , but i 've recently been listening to his trauermarsch or grande marche fun\u00e8bre in c minor d. 859 , op. 55 . 
  it 's a piece for four hands piano .

  youtube has a strict policy of not revealing how much money you 're getting , so if he were to link the video it would reveal who he is , and then he would have revealed his youtube income , which is a violation of the terms . 
  huh , i did n't realise you hung out outside of / r/habitrpg . 
  that is no way for the leader of a country to behave . 
  plain and simple . 
  huh , that 's not what i 've heard . 
  lots of youtubers have specifically mentioned that they ca n't say , and i 've heard it discussed on reddit that way before too . 
  we do n't measure kelvin in degrees since it 's not at an arbitrary starting point .

  the approval voting that you mention seems like a lazy man 's equivalent of alternative vote ( which is what most people mean when they say `` av '' ) aka instant-runoff voting . 
  in that system , you preference candidates number 1 -- however many you like ( australia requires you number * every * candidate , however the system does n't have to work like this ) . 
  a simple algorithm works out winners by counting up all the 1 votes , and in no candidate reaches 50 % + 1 , the lowest primary vote candidate is removed and his voters ' 2 votes get distributed , and so forth . 
  i was at a pub in the uk and they accepted my australian student id . 
  that is n't even legal identification for drinking in australia . 
   i guess there is some validity to that strain of thought ... infuriating none the less .
