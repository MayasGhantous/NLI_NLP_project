  no , no there was n't . 
  unless you come from some sort of bizarro country that issues passports without name and photo , a passport is most definitely valid id . 
  sounds to me like he was just being a dick and trying to exercise his power , although on the off chance he was actually following regulation , then it 's just shitty regulation . 
  shitty as that is , he woulda gotten in even without preferential voting . 
  the people ( on the whole ) wanted him in , so he got in . 
  that 's the voting system working . 
  the problem lies in the media , not the voting system .

  that 's the voting system working . 
  the problem lies in the media , not the voting system . 
   and if we did n't have preferential voting , the liberals would have had an even greater landslide , given that by far the biggest third party is the greens . 
  all of those greens votes , except for those in the seat of melbourne , would have essentially been votes for the coalition . 
  well , kinda . 
  that assumes ceteris paribus , which is n't how it would happen . 
  i voted 1 green in reps , and had them well above any major party in the senate . 
  if we had fptp voting , though , i would have voted 1 labor , specifically because i know about the spoiler effect . 
  i suspect many , many others would have too . 
  and does n't have the list mps ( and the undemocraticness that comes with them ) of the mmp system . 
  shitty as it is , abbott woulda gotten in even without preferential voting . 
  the people ( on the whole ) wanted him in , so he got in . 
  that 's the voting system working . 
  our problem lies in the media , not the voting system . 
  ca n't form a coalition government if you did n't get the mps into parliament to begin with . 
  if the left vote is split , then within * each seat * there will be a higher chance for the single right party to win . 
  for example , did you know that it is possible , in a fptp system , for a party to form government with 25 % + [ half the number of total seats ] + [ 50 % of one remaining seat + [ 1 person ] ] , or , slightly over 25 % of the total popular vote ? 
  just wondering because that 's the only major english speaking country with a hung parliament if you were talking from experience . 
  australia too , until earlier this month . 
   i think the coalition in the uk works a lot better than most give it credit , parties squabble a lot but it has gone much smoother over here than it may have done . 
  this works very well as a description of the previous australian government , as well . 
  the media and the right-wing opposition flung so much shit at the former government , but it was actually doing an incredible job . 
  a better job than most former governments which * were n't * in coalition . 
  the public just ate up the crap , though , and now we 're stuck with a strong majority from our right wing party . 
  oh i should mention , our coalition was labor + independents + greens . 
  the right-wing liberal party was in opposition , and it was the one doing the shit-flinging . 
  it was n't members within the coalition doing the fighting . 
  something something do n't mention the fucking cricket . 
  which school ? 
  i used to go to one of the international schools in saigon ( and my parents teach there ) . 
  source : lived in vietnam until recently . 
  holy shit , he edited it ? 
  aww ... 
  i would agree , but as far as voting results are concerned that is irrelevant . 
  are n't he and sir ian mckellen putting on a couple of shows really soon ? 
  could n't he promote that ? 
  worldwide , [ ** more than 600 million people live on land 10 m or less above sea level ** ] ( http://www.globalgreen.org/articles/global/95 ) . 
  rising sea levels will require them to move . 
  if you take a more conservative number of 5 m , then the number drops to [ 200 million currently , with expectations of it rising to as much as 500 million by the end of the century ] ( http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/coasts/living-in-coastal-areas/ ) . 
  additionally , we 're already starting to see the effects of more frequent extreme weather events like cyclones ( aka typhoons or hurricanes ) , bush fires , and flooding . 
  there is n't much we can do to adapt to these . 
  rising temperatures is not something crops can adapt to . 
  as temperatures rise , foods that grow best in temperate climates will retreat further and further north , until it becomes unrealistic to grow them at all . 
  a quadruple majority , in fact . 
  in order for a referendum to be put to the public it first must pass through parliament . 
  do you have * any * idea how much that would cost ? 
  you have to move ** over 600 * million * people ** , plus huge numbers of buildings and infrastructure . 
  it does n't matter what the timescale is , the cost of that is ** massive ** . 
  i never suggested that humanity would disappear . 
  we 're advanced enough to survive as a * species * . 
  but at the very least the economic cost of it would be * humongous * . 
  the cost of migrating all those people would be among the largest projects * ever * undertaken . 
  and is the death of hundreds of thousands of people as a result of increasing extreme weather events not worth worrying about ? 
  it would n't matter to the species , but it sure is shitty . 
  and a lower variety of food availability means a lower quality of life . 
  it could be particularly bad for those living around the equator who may find it too hot to grow nearly any kinds of sustenance . 
  we ca n't make hypothetical arguments about what * might * be possible in the future to combat things that we know * will * occur . 
  the liberal party is the conservatives . 
  outside of america , the term `` liberal '' usually refers to right-wing economic policies . 
  that 's the party abbott is from . 
  there was definitely infighting going on within the labor party -- the largest part of the coalition , but that started towards the end of the previous term of government ( which was a labor majority ) and was a result of low polling , not due to the fact that there was a coalition . 
  i know that there are a number of actions that can be taken which will decrease the likelihood of rising sea levels , yes . 
  irrelevant . 
  we know we can decrease rising sea levels , how much we decrease them by is difficult to ascertain , but any difference is a good thing , as even if it does n't completely prevent it , it will decrease the impact . 
  i thought that was fairly obvious . 
  the company 's name is the intellectual property awareness foundation , it 's hardly disguising their purpose . 
  they want to make people aware about intellectual property and in what ways it is supposedly harming content creators . 
  * sigh *, 
  which tpp are we talking about here ? 
  the initialism stands for at least 3 different things off the top of my head , at least two of which work in this sentence . 
  he did n't say it 's good for us , he 's saying that this video is the start of the advertising campaign designed to make us believe it 's good for us . 
  i never said they get special treatment that helps them in negotiations with unions , only that they get special treatment . 
  this includes subsidies for a number of businesses that are not profitable enough to run on their own ( which admittedly is a good thing in some cases , but not in all ) . 
  but if i were to speak regarding advantages in negotiations with unions , i would point to the former howard government 's work choices amendment to the workplace relations act , although that was repealed in 2007 under the rudd government . 
  yeah i read it a while back in french class , so that 's what i was thinking this was about . 
  huh ... never heard that one before . 
  i 've heard music , and maths . 
  even heard money once or twice before . 
  but never smiling . 
  i quite like that one , though . 
  i do n't think it hurts to watch . 
  i think it 's really sweet , actually . 
  sure it 's kinda embarrassing at the start , but then they helped the blind guy actually do it and it seemed to make him really happy . 
  octopi is the word you 're going for . 
  octopodes is the more technically correct term , though . 
  octopuses is also accepted . 
  octopodes is the way the word would have been pluralised in greek , which is where the word actually comes from . 
  octopi is technically regarded as incorrect , as it is how the word would be pluralised in latin , which has no relation to the actual word . 
  still , octopi has been used so often it is found in a number of major dictionaries . 
  octopuses is the most common english word . 
  the english language is really fun when you get into it , and in general you can get away with pretty much anything .
