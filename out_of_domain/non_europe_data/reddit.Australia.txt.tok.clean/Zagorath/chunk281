  edit, 
  and yes , one can convert directly from any timezone to any other . 
  the problem is , when you live somewhere like utc +7 or +10 , and you 're converting from somewhere in the us , remembering what conversion to use is more difficult . 
  trust me , this exact issue is a regular occurrence . 
  add in the fact that you guys observe daylight saving and the issue only compounds as now i 'm expected to know when the us starts and ends that . 
  since the introduction of unicode in urls , that may not be entirely sufficient in all cases . 
  it 's best to type in the url yourself for anything involving money . 
  dammit now i want to get an a clarinet just to do this . 
  ( nah ... that 's not the only reason ... ), 
  could just be graphical design software such as illustrator . 
  sibelius could do this too , although it would n't be particularly easy for some of the weirder bits . 
  so was google wave . 
  i miss wave . 
  google pays whatever tax they are required by law to pay . 
  if you want them to pay more , then advocate for stronger tax laws . 
  do n't expect businesses to voluntarily pay tax . 
  symphony no. 1 in e minor by jean sibelius . 
  it does indeed require the use of both bb and a clarinets . 
  it also starts with a lengthy clarinet solo ( and , in my opinion , a really lovely one ) . 
  edit : [ youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzuayjppo0 ) , [ imslp ( clarinet part ) ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8b/imslp49615-pmlp38344-sibelius-sym1.clarinet.pdf ) , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._1_\\ ( sibelius \\ ) ) . 
  if you 're not familiar with it , i would highly recommend it , it 's a lovely symphony . 
  i do n't know about him , but assuming / u/logicalthinker1 is correct in saying he denounced his canadian citizenship , then no , he is n't still canadian . 
  perhaps logicalthinker is incorrect in that , i honestly do n't know the details . 
  i 'm not an expert in the requirements to become a senator in the us , but according to wikipedia , it is required that you are a ) over 30 , b ) have been a citizen of the us for at least 9 years c ) inhabitants of the state they are seeking to become a senator of . 
  it 's that ( b ) that i 'd like to take a look at . 
  you used the term `` naturalized citizen '' . 
  perhaps you 're using that term incorrectly , but if you are n't , then yes , there is a requirement to be a naturalised citizen before you can be a senator . 
  the term that you might be confusing it with is `` natural born '' , which is another thing , and is required to hold the presidency of the united states . 
  hi from the largest `` new world '' country in the eastern hemisphere . 
  ( and we also have birthright citizenship . ), 
  no , the two are not the same . 
  naturalisation is used to describe when someone becomes a citizen who was n't previously , and by extension a naturalised citizen is anyone who is a legal citizen of the country . 
  to my knowledge any decent korean will beat a russian in at least the last two of those . 
  what is it ? 
  when i google it i get links to a protein called `` parkin '' ; parkinson 's disease ( the well-known degenerative disorder ) ; parkinsonism , aka parkinson 's syndrome , a neurological syndrome with similar symptoms as parkinson 's disease ; and parkinson plus syndrome , a group of diseases with the symptoms of parkison 's plus more . 
  but not anywhere do i find parkin 's syndrome . 
  could i get the link that you found ? 
  what 's the reason for running the software through the hp remote graphics client ? 
  i agree with you in general , but in this particular case it looks like the room is fairly empty . 
  i 'd say as long as there are at least a few computers not being occupied , it 's ok to do this sort of thing . 
  hmm fair enough , thanks for the correction . 
  starcraft , though , they 've still got . 
  is that kinda like one computer running two workstations ? 
  many people see it from their home page and do n't check the subreddit . 
  that , or they might have assumed it was europe , canada , or anz . 
  yeah but it 's just not the same :(, 
  in seriousness , though , the ability to have inline comments and threaded conversations was really powerful , not to mention its capacity for instant conversations . 
  if you wo n't put up with that , then i 'm sorry , but you 're not going to be very happy . 
  it 's within the law that they can do this , and as long as it is legal for them to , they will continue to . 
  they 'll see no criticism from me for it , either . 
  i would agree that the loopholes should probably be plugged , but i wo n't criticise companies for exploiting them while they 're there . 
  you might want to try / r/truegaming . 
  i do n't know if it 'll actually do it for you , but it 's worth a look if you have n't already . 
  did n't convince me , but it sure as heck helped me say yes the first time someone invited me to play . 
  are you * the * dan harmon ? 
  yeah i 'm really worried that ludlum might not make it back , seeing as he 's one of our best politicians . 
  yeah , i voted pirate party first , greens second . 
  not in wa though , so i wo n't have had any effect on ludlum 's chances ... 
  you pretty much described labor . 
  they 're pretty rightish/centre really . 
  the only reason they get called left is because they historically were , and they are compared to the liberals . 
  ~ ~ fun ~ ~ fact . 
  in that gif he 's laughing about genocide . 
  can i just say , catch me if you can is a fantastic score . 
  williams did such a good job on it -- it does n't sound anything like a typical williams score . 
  i played a selection from it with my concert band recently . 
  and the civilisation series has a heap of fantastic music !, 
  you might like [ beethoven 's symphony no . 
  3 , mvt . 
  2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ag3fmnq5km ) , which was used in civ ii and civ ii : test of time when you completely wiped out an enemy civ . 
  civ v has the [ carmen suite prelude ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxmwtznrw2m ) which is also awesome . 
  edit : other music from civ v. 
  [ death of ase ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2akxf1h5r4g ) , from the same suite as [ morning ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdf988wigum ) and [ in the hall of the mountain king ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xriyt-mrvai ) , which you may be familiar with from popular culture . 
  [ berceuse op. 56 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhq1v-bqt_s ) by faur\u00e9 , and [ berceuse op. 16 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrgvbwpgjc8 ) , also faur\u00e9 . 
  two completely unrelated pieces ( as far as i can tell ) that just happen to have the same name . 
  [ adagietto from mahler symphony no. 5 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjz2tvc2tt4 ) is also in there , and the entire symphony is absolutely lovely -- one of the best works of the early 20th century -- but even just the adagietto is incredibly sublime . 
  in most countries ( aus and the uk are the only exceptions i know of , i 'd hazard a guess nz is in there too ) the vast majority of plugs can just be plugged into at any time -- they 're always live . 
  i just bought a set of [ a-jays ] ( http://www.shopabout.sg/media/wysiwyg/udvendor-48/jays/a-jays-three-e3.jpg ) . 
  they advertise that the flat cable means they do n't get tangled , and * holy fuck * it really works . 
  i just have to shake them out a little and they 're ready to use , no tangles . 
  also the a-jays 1 + ( which i got ) have a mic and single button , which is really handy . 
  ( or would be if the android os was n't such a bitch about it . ), 
  true , that is an issue . 
  the trick is to learn which way they should go on your computer and remember it . 
  it is n't really that hard after a little while . 
  i want that cable for my android phone just because of the fact it can go in either way . 
  so convenient , even if i have gotten used to which way to plug in the cable . 
  side note , god dammit google , why do your devices not have consistent designs . 
  the nexus 4 and nexus 7 plug in the micro-usb cables the opposite way . 
  it 's right there on the keyboard , next to f12/volume up button . 
  hmm , i 've been to each of those a few times but never noticed it . 
  it 's not really something you pay attention to , though , i guess . 
  that 's absolutely true , flat cables are what do it . 
  i just pointed it out because they 're also really nice earphones , and they were the first ones i had heard of that have flat cables . 
  the [ official nexus earphones ] ( https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/nexus_4_wired_headset_with_microphone?id=nexus_4_headset ) are also flat , so should do the same thing . 
  yeah that 's what i mean , i would love for that particular feature . 
  it 's particularly convenient for tvs and such because rather than unplugging them ( which can be awkward ) you just flick a single switch at the wall . 
  i read once that a tv on standby mode uses as much as 60 % the amount of energy as when it 's fully on , so turning it off completely is really important . 
  a delta ? 
  there are instructions in the sidebar , or you could copy and paste it from there .
