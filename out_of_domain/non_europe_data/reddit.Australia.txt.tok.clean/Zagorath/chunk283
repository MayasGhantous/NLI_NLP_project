  no they do n't , because netflix probably is n't available in pakistan , just like it is n't here . 
  edit : and before people start with the pms about hola unblocker or similar , i get it , you can get around the restrictions . 
  i do n't want to have to be jumping through hoops to * pay * for my media . 
  * not a historian * , but i vaguely remember hearing once about lugwig van beethoven and at least one person confusing him for aristocracy because of the `` van '' in his name , confusing it for the more typical german `` von '' . 
  is there a / r/shittyaskhistorians ? 
  haha yeah i saw it too . 
  it 's kinda disappointing compared to shittyaskscience, 
  well , no , it does n't quite function the same . 
  in german von is exclusive to the aristocracy , while the dutch van is not . 
  that 's what lead to the confusion i described . 
  ah , good point . 
  i suppose i heard `` europeans first arrived '' and immediately thought of later , when it was ` discovered ' by * modern * europeans . 
  thanks for pointing out the mistake . 
  god dammit abbrevi8 . 
  you are so often the sensible voice arguing a right wing stance , and then you go and say bullshit like this . 
  this is why people call you a troll . 
  i thought the republic referendum previously was sabotaged by disagreement among the republicans as to which type of republic to move to . 
   like i used to, 
  curious . 
  what 's your opinion on the matter now ? 
  fair enough . 
  you might be interested to look at the pirate party . 
  one of their major policies is [ creating a bill of rights ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/bill_of_rights ) . 
  no , he had previously convinced me that he honestly believed in a right wing stance and was willing to argue it in a reasonable way . 
  i do n't and never will agree with right wing economics , but that does n't mean it is * necessarily * wrong or unreasonable . 
  stand by , i 'm in the middle of writing a rather lengthy comment replying to him . 
  how come you do n't just release one that everyone can use ? 
   you mean just mount right ? 
  why extract the iso when it takes two clicks and 1 second to mount it . 
  they often come in a zip or rar format , which requires extraction . 
    patch , find a crack for the patch . 
   extremely easy . 
  usually , but certainly not always . 
  frequently there will be problems . 
  even when everything goes smoothly , it 's still harder than just downloading from steam . 
  you have to navigate through the install folder to find the right file to replace with the crack . 
  i do n't mean to be rude , but how is this in any way related to nexus 4 ? 
  it seems a very specific thing about the * carriers * of phones in the us , and the device is irrelevant to all of that . 
  i 've read a lot of things online that apparently in the us a lot of carriers do n't allow tethering devices . 
  i googled ` straight talk ' , and then searched with their internal search for ` tether ' and it came up with [ this page ] ( http://www.straighttalk.com/wps/portal/terms%20and%20conditions/!ut/p/b1/hc_bbojaeabgj5kz3quxljkocwjsdip7y0cnays21ht16bsmvamn6dxn5pvj_cchihyyqk1lz7aceay_2n19au_h-v3ry_hawzbmb7agmexpgequitzokkqfjvsoutuvnsymbmnktz0smtt5f0cqbfhlmdoggbxq67y7fqt3wz3r8bovxsjojmrgdmsedyjpmsmqx3xsedlets28brdzcijkz2ucihs7yerhds4wdv0iqbznrw2bxknnv_mru4sxznjodvi6kpz8evpvpicgukgachofjzif0h-al8pgsmsp30evz7drpwqwtfffo-leqa !, 
  ! / dl4/d5/l2dbisevz0fbis9nqseh / ? urile = wcm % 3apath % 3a % 2fstraighttalk % 2ffooter % 2fterms % 20and % 20conditions ) , which contains their policy :, 
   straight talk unlimited plans can not be used for : any applications that tether your device to a laptop or personal computer other than for the use of wireless sync . 
  so i 'm guessing you are n't allowed to do it on your plan ? 
  ok first of all , it 's bullshit because you are n't even trying to present your argument in a way that is at all conducive to debate . 
  instead , you just -- and in this case it was clearly without the justification that i 've seen you use in the past that it was the lefties that started it -- fall into the trolling tactic of calling all politicians `` professional liars '' . 
   plenty of left/green voters want more government involvment [ sic ] in their lives and a bigger government, 
  not true . 
  i advocate for the legalisation of marijuana and decriminalisation of most other drugs -- despite never wanting to go near using them myself . 
  i advocate for less restrictive alcohol laws ( in queensland , at least , it is illegal to drink alcohol in a public place ) in certain cases . 
  what lefties like is a government which provides useful government services to its people , and restrict things when it is for the common good . 
  most particularly , i 'm a big believer in the use of regulation and taxation ( as well as subsidies ) when it comes to [ moving production or consumption of a certain good or service towards the social optimum ] ( http://www.anzhealthpolicy.com/content/figures/1743-8462-2-13-1-l.jpg ) . 
  you might disagree with that political stance , but using expressions like `` want more government involvment in their lives and a bigger government '' ( not to mention anyone that uses the abhorrent an unintellectual word `` statist '' ) is deliberately misrepresenting the argument and not at all conducive to intelligent debate . 
   here we have a politician representing the ideal of democracy , that an everyman stands up for what he believes in and is elected to parliment [ sic ] to represent the ideas of those who voted for him, 
  that 's not what we have here , and you bloody well know it . 
  he was elected based on the thoroughly undemocratic method of group voting tickets . 
  he 's in parliament , and has every right to be under the law , and therefore has every right to act as he wishes , but that most certainly does not put him above criticism , especially on the fact that a fairer electoral system would ** not ** have put him into parliament . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd be willing to provide a source for that quote ? 
  i tried googling bits of it ( with quote marks ) but they all turned up no results . 
  if that truly echoes your own sentiments , then perhaps i was putting too much merit in your opinion . 
  i thought you were usually willing to be reasonable , except that you sometimes get driven to trollish behaviour by unfair lefties . 
  but this statement makes me realise that i was wrong . 
  if you truly agree with someone making statements like, 
   they beg for more government cock . 
  literally beg, 
   you evaluate a policy based on how much it grows the state . 
  if it does n't grow the state , you dislike it . 
  if it does , you like it . 
   if the government is [ invading privacy ] , it 's `` for our own good '' . 
  that 's what you actually believe . 
   most australians are crying out for the government to ban private schools, 
   most australians would be quite happy with the idea that the government should take them and raise them themselves . 
  especially those last two , which i have never * once * heard anyone even touch upon . 
  ( all i personally think is that government subsidies to these schools should end or be significantly decreased . ), 
  and suggesting that people would be happy for the government to take their babies and raise them ? 
  holy fuck abbrevi8 , if you seriously think any remotely significant number of people would be happy with that , you seriously have some mental problems . 
  i 'm sorry i ever tried to take you seriously . 
  i have n't liked libertarians since the first time i ended a conversation with one , but time and time again i 've tried to be reasonable and time and time again they 've shown that they are not interested in reasonable debate , instead turning to emotional arguments and using words like `` statists '' and `` big government '' . 
  nobody here wants to listen to what you have to say , because you are n't interested in having real conversations with people . 
  tau  pi ( both figuratively and literally ), 
  huh ? 
  i said nothing of the sort . 
  it 's not hard to learn to do , it just takes more time and effort , even when you know what you 're doing , than pressing `` download '' on steam . 
  well obviously , but that 's why i said it also works figuratively . 
  i disagree . 
  yes beethoven 's most well known for symphony no. 5 , but i think he * should * be known for his symphony no. 3 or 9 . 
  waldstein 's good , but it did n't have the effect on the history of music that the 3rd ( often regarded the first piece of ` romantic era ' music ) or the 9th ( which really turned the symphony into a huge piece of repertoire , even more than his previous symphonies , as well as making it ok to have choir in a symphony ) did . 
  yeah , it 's probably best that a composer 's best known work * is n't * something we are n't even certain he wrote . 
  hmm , i would 've thought copland 's most famous work would be rodeo . 
   where can it be seen ? 
   after its big screen premiere in late august it will shown as part of the pythia film festival in brisbane . 
  it will also , of course , be available online on vimeo and youtube . 
  from their [ faqs ] ( http://swdufanfilm.com/faq/ ) . 
  \\* scribbles something on paper *, 
  tuba 's not quirky , it 's just dumb . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ hurt ^ ^ ^ ^ me . 
  no , people absolutely do say that when the company is apple . 
  they just get downvoted by the mass `` let 's hate on apple '' crowd . 
  i know , because i 've fallen victim to this many times . 
  coupla questions since you seem knowledgeable . 
  where is the nexus 7 ( old one or new one , or both , whatever 's fine ) made ?
