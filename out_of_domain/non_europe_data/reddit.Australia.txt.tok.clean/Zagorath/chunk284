  and are other apple build-to-order machines not made in the usa ? 
  bto macbook pros ? 
  i was giving him that credit , until [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1o3l95/pup_set_to_join_forces_with_micro_party/ccoo5yi ) . 
  now , i 'm done with him . 
  whenever i see him i 'm just going to downvote and move on , he 's not worth any more time . 
  relevant username ? 
  here 's the biggest reason dvorak is a better choice . 
  it 's far more popular . 
  every major desktop operating system ( windows , os x , and common linux distros ) have it available out of the box , just a quick settings change . 
  it 's also available in this way on android phones . 
  for colemak , you would have to download and run some sort of application on any computer you use , which is going to be possible less often than changing the layout in the settings is . 
  i 'd be interested to see those heatmaps to see just how large the differences are , but all the studies i 've seen in the past have shown that the difference is marginal at best . 
  by the way , if you 're on os x , use the dvorak-qwerty [ command ] layout . 
  it lets you use the same old keyboard shortcuts rather than have to press command-i ( or , to be specific , the position that i is in on qwerty ) to copy , by switching to qwerty automatically while the command key is held down . 
  high quality roads help too . 
  huh , so it is . 
  i never realised it . 
  i 'm doing a bachelor of engineering , majoring in software engineering , and it 's a degree that i 'd highly recommend considering . 
  csse1001 is a course you 'll probably take in your first semester , and if you want to get a 7 in it , prior experience in python is * required * . 
  you have to do an optional third assignment that is graded really strictly compared to the two mandatory ones . 
  it 's basically impossible to do unless you have prior experience . 
  infs1200 so far ( i 'm currently taking it ) seems like an absolute walkthrough course . 
  the assignment and 1st quiz were super easy , no actual programming required . 
  the 2nd quiz ( and the exam , i would assume ) requires some knowledge of sql , but it 's taught pretty well and the learning resources a good . 
  probably not worth doing too much in the way of learning sql beforehand . 
  infs1200 does n't use ms access , it uses mysql with a tool called phpmyadmin as a front end . 
  one thing i found very interesting [ here ] ( http://blog.andrewsnucins.ca/?p=1550 ) is that she 's holding the * bow * left handed , but in all the photos with the sword , it 's in her right hand . 
  i do n't know what good archery form looks like , but [ in the other photos ] ( http://blog.andrewsnucins.ca/?p=1550 ) where she 's holding a drawn bow , it looks really awkward to me , compared to this one . 
  black holes form when the energy created by fusion within the star is no longer sufficient to keep the mass of the star from collapsing into itself under gravity , and the mass is so great that it overcomes the neutron degeneracy pressure ( the pressure caused by neutrons which would otherwise prevent it from collapsing further ) . 
  hence , it is n't really undergoing fusion anymore in any significant way, 
   from an outsider perspective , there 's no practical difference between a black hole , and a neutron star that 's just slightly larger than the * tolman -- oppenheimer -- volkoff limit *, 
  ftfy . 
  the radius is irrelevant to whether or not a star will form a black hole , it 's the mass of the initial star which must be above the tov limit . 
  why do you know it 's about the flash ? 
  what 's he got to do with this show ? 
  while watching the first season i got the impression that speedy was n't going to be a ` sidekick ' or a ` hero ' per se , but that she 's just a sort of mentor for her brother . 
  i 'm so confused . 
  why is everyone talking about the flash ? 
  is dc building towards a justice league live action show ? 
  i really hope they do n't ... that movie was awful . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd agree with cyborg and captain marvel being a-list . 
  the only reason i know about cyborg at all is from watching teen titans * aages * ago when i was young , and captain marvel from young justice more recently . 
  australian here , i ca n't say i 've ever heard anyone use that phrase . 
   eat less than you put in, 
  ( but seriously , good on you for losing weight , and i got what you were trying to say . 
  put less in than what comes out via exercise . ), 
  pff , everyone know 's there 's no such thing as dwarven women . 
  dwarves just spring up from holes in the ground . 
  cool , done . 
  lax ? 
  the only typo i can think of for that would be ` sax ' , but unless you use the dvorak keyboard the letters s and l are n't near each other , and the sax does n't have an alternate fingering anyway ... 
  no , we have n't observed it directly to my knowledge , but the same is true for a huge number of major concepts in astrophysics . 
  ah , right . 
  cheers . 
  brilliant idea , and i would not be at all unhappy if it turned out you were exactly right . 
  just one thing , the word for ` puts on ' is ' [ dons ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don#verb ) ' not dawns . . 
  as someone who has n't read any of the comics and only had limited experience with other dc shows , this is brilliant !, 
  only one problem i have , is that, 
   particle accelerator in central city - snow mentions a particle accelerator being built in central city , which should be completed by christmas . 
  i wonder what that could be used for ... 
  i only understand what this is getting at because of other reddit threads i 've read which have pointed it out . 
  i feel a site like this one should n't be relying on that sort of outside knowledge . 
  damn this site is awesome . 
  i 'm going to have to go back and rewatch all of season 1 while following along with this now . 
  never watched it . 
  would you recommend it ? 
  i assumed he 's not american because ~ ~ if ~ ~ of the bad english in the title ( `` on '' ) , and because the number and popularity of bikes makes me think europe . 
  could have just learned a lot of his english from american media , or possibly even had a formal education teaching american english . 
  i 'd say the latter is unlikely though , especially if he is european . 
  edit : muphry 's law strikes again . 
  kinda . 
  i 'd say it can also be used when referring to the ` rape ' of a culture . 
  [ south dekota ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1o604m/this_is_one_of_the_reasons_i_love_living_in_a/ccpaasl?context=3 ) , actually . 
  at least , google tells me that 's what sd stands for in the context of harrisburg . 
  aww that 's a shame . 
  i just wanted it because i mostly play when i do n't have an internet connection , so mainly play singleplayer . 
  but i can understand the concern . 
  ah well . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , i 'm a musician and my biggest issue was with the music . 
  i think hans zimmer is a massively overrated musician , and he never had any hope of living up to john williams ' reputation . 
  the music did n't feel to me like it captured ` superman ' at all . 
  but even ignoring that , i thought it was terrible , and i 've heard a lot of people agree . 
  the acting was n't great ( was n't horrible , either , imo ) , but a lot of the script just felt awful . 
  a big part of the problem to me was it 's far too dark . 
  like it was trying to go the dark knight route . 
  but that route , to me , just does n't work for superman . 
  he and batman feel like perfect foils of each other , so trying to make superman * into * batman feels forced and unnatural . 
  powerful , i 'm sure they are . 
  but that 's not how i 'd define a-list . 
  to me , the a-listers are the frontrunners , the ones everyone knows about and associates with the justice league . 
  when you say ` justice league ' to someone only familiar with it in passing , what characters are they going to picture ? 
  those characters are the a-list . 
  the motif * does * define the whole piece . 
  it appears clearly in the 3rd movement , and pops up subtly in both the 2nd and 4th movements . 
  edit : but i agree , the whole piece * is * incredible , and it 's a shame people do n't know the entire piece . 
  yeah , there 's a big difference between `` i do n't have any kids '' , and `` i do n't have any kids who have been injured on a car door '' . 
  very true , i 'd say the opening 5 bars of the 5th , ode to joy from the 9th , ` moonlight ' sonata , and f\u00fcr elise are all strong contenders for the spot . 
  i 'm not really making any particular claim that one is * definitely * the number one . 
  i just did n't feel like disagreeing with / u/kelmhill on that issue since i partly agreed and the main point of my comment was regarding the part about which one they * should * be known for . 
  it 's not just america , here in brisbane , aus , there are n't nearly enough separate bike paths .
