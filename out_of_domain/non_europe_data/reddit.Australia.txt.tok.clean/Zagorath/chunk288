  thongs are n't the same as sandals . 
  thongs are [ these ] ( http://www.tropicaltours.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/courtsesy-of-australia-geographic3.jpg ) ( sorry about the annoying flag-waving , i had to search `` thongs australia '' in order to get actual thongs ) , sandals are [ these ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/883603559/aokang-breathable-sandals-male-leather-sandals-daily-casual-sandals-men-s-drag-shoes-sandals.jpg ) . 
  yeah fair enough , it makes total sense . 
  it was just a bit funny hearing the announcements on the train about how important it is to drink a lot of water . 
  a better comparison would be that for a woman on a first date it is polite to offer to split the bill , even if convention expects the man to refuse the offer . 
  i 'm firmly anti-gun , or rather pro-gun regulation . 
  but you know what , go ahead . 
  i think guns for hunting are fine , i just think that there should be regulation on how those guns ( and ammo ) are stored , and you should need to have a license to have one so that crazy people do n't get them as seems to fairly frequently happen . 
  that 's my exact point , it 's a polite thing to do , even though you both know you are n't expected to . 
  i was aroused by the recent * top gear * programme in which richard hammond quite blatantly had a hairstyle like an absolute idiot . 
  this is an disgusting [ sic ] example to be setting my friend alan . 
  i will be making a point of sitting through every hour of every future episode of this strangely sexual programme that i claim to dislike in order to ensure that this sort of steamy behaviour does not occur again . 
  if this disgraceful manchild does n't clean up his/her act , i 'll be forced to write a stiff letter of complaint to the daily mail . 
  exactly . 
  op seems to be making the common mistake that ~ ~ religion ~ ~ marriage was originally a religious convention . 
  it was n't . 
  marriage started out as a legal way of representing a tie between two people for purposes such as protection and finances . 
  edit : religion is a religious convention . 
  marriage is n't . 
  i big part of this is that most places with a lack of tipping culture also have a decent minimum wage , which the us lacks ( minimum wage in the us is significantly lower than at any point in the past , adjusted for inflation ) . 
  so making a comparison like this is difficult . 
  there 's also the fact that you are presenting somewhat of a false dichotomy . 
  in most western cultures tipping does still exist , but is saved only for particularly good service , rather than being expected of everyone , to the point that it is considered rude * not * to tip . 
  oh shit , he meant `` piss on '' * literally *, 
  hahaha . 
  thanks for spotting that , it 's currently like 5:15 am , so my brain is n't functioning correctly . 
  man that video desperately needs a reverse wadsworth . 
  just chop of the last 30 % . 
  my parents are teachers , and i can confirm teachers * hate * parents like this . 
   tip : remove `` x and '' and use whichever personal pronoun is appropriate, 
  urgh yes . 
  it *** really *** is n't that hard to do . 
  yeah , it looks like what i 've always known as parent-teacher night . 
  not the underground , the larger train system . 
  i was staying in hertford and caught the train in to london . 
  but i 'm not criticising anything . 
  i actually think the reminders to drink water are brilliant . 
  it seems a bit naff at first , but it really makes sense . 
  like they are here in australia , i think . 
  well i guess . 
  inadvertently . 
  at the time i legitimately thought the product was faulty . 
  it was n't until they sent the replacement and i used their cable from that one that i realised the mistake . 
  the cable these battery packs used to charge was one i did n't have any of my own . 
  after a little more research it would seem that technically you are correct . 
  the law states that it can not be brought into the country for purposes of trade , but does n't specify an amount legal for personal use , so strictly speaking bringing any in is illegal . 
  however , i came across numerous anecdotes suggesting that the law is not very strictly enforced , and that if you only have a small amount , they 'll let you get away with it . 
  italicised looks * really * , ** really ** weird when written the american way . 
  most words i 'm used to , but that one is just *** weird *** . 
  \\* p.s. , if you want words surrounded in asterisks , use the \\ as an escape character * . 
  press `` view source '' under my comment to get a look at how it 's done . 
  you did n't try to figure out * how * they knew it was you ? 
  or do you have any guesses as to how they knew ? 
  aww man , if you did a course on coursera or udemy or some other site like that , i think i would go crazy . 
  in a good way . 
  can multiple people play * different * games through family sharing at once ? 
  or does that cause the same countdown to when you have to quit ? 
  someone 's comment a little higher up explains this really well :, 
   it 's actually pronounced * luef * - tenant , but they sound remarkably similar since the f and t run together . 
  the pronunciation came from the old french ** `` luef '' ** meaning * place * changing into the modern french ** `` lieu '' ** which has the same definition , hence * luef * - tenant . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lieutenant ), 
  it almost does . 
  there 's a tiny sliver of border with russia in the north east . 
  let 's ignore the 100 year rule for simplicity 's sake . 
  it would actually be 4 in 1461 , assuming that they are not born on 29.02 , since you can be born on any arbitrary day ( other than 29.02 ) in any year . 
  that 's true , but irrelevant to this fact . 
  the birthday problem ( 50 % probability of a shared birthday with 23 people , 99 % with 57 people ) is calculated assuming ( incorrectly , admittedly ) an even distribution of birthdays . 
  you do n't pronounce jpeg jay-feg . 
  or scuba scubba , or nasa naesa . 
  whether or not you pronounce gif with a hard or soft g , the argument about how g stands for graphics is completely irrelevant . 
  why not pronounce scuba as scubba , or jpeg as jay-feg ? 
  the pronunciation of an acronym has no bearing on what it stands for . 
  not sure if it was his favourite or not , but it was apparently because they had a slogan that was something like ` choosy mums choose jif ' . 
  he wanted gif to be ` choosy developers choose gif ' . 
  as in , soft g , but i do n't add in the ` a ' that is n't written there . 
  [ here is wikipedia ipa for english ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_for_english ) . 
  hear , hear . 
  something we can all agree on . 
  your spelling of gaol makes me swoon a little . 
  i 'm not sure of the last time i * ever * saw anyone write it like that , when it 's clearly the best spelling . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  i was only going off of what i 've heard online previously . 
  holy shit what ? 
  how can they sell auspost , they 're responsible for so many government related things . 
  they 're the ones you go to to get a tax file number or a passport . 
  but that really is n't a marxist perspective . 
  the free market * can not * fix everything , but a fully centralised market would be just as bad , probably worse . 
  you 're arguing for a good compromise between the two , which is what is best for everyone . 
  when you present it like that , nobody is going to disagree with you too much . 
  but what you 're arguing for here * is n't * a completely free market , it 's a market that is largely free , but with sensible regulations in place to correct inefficiencies . 
  ah , right . 
  not \\* * quite ** as bad as i was imagining . 
  so java will work properly . 
  that 's my main reason , anyway . 
  haha this is actually really cool !, 
  yeah i guess technically it was . 
  ok then . 
  the status quo is that it 's a government institution . 
  i 'm not sure how that changes things . 
  i was really annoyed that it would n't take beethoven symphony no. 5 .
