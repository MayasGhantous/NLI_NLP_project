  it insisted on a space before the ' 5 ' . 
  yeah , you 'll often notice it when the screen flashes back to the desktop briefly after going black . 
  it wo n't be its usual orange self . 
  i dunno , that selfie of yours looks awfully prune-like to me . 
  i have to say , 87 seems a really good idea to me . 
  i do n't like the tpp for a number of reasons , but a lack of restriction on trade is beneficial to the economy in most cases . 
  not true , at least from what i 've read . 
  the situation seems to be that were it put to a vote in the house , it would pass . 
  however , due to a quirk in the law , only the majority leader in the house is able to put it up to the vote , and he is against it . 
  thus , despite the majority of parliamentarians being in favour of it , a minority is able to hold everyone else hostage . 
  never mind the fact that the aca * has already passed through * and been approved , which by definition means that it has the support of those in congress , which means as far as the law is concerned , it does have the support of the people . 
  ( gerrymandering and the lack of proportional representation mean that membership in congress does n't really equate to the will of the people , but that 's not particularly relevant here . ), 
  i would tend to agree with op , but your view i have a problem with . 
  that would imply that a government does not have the right to enforce its laws on tourists and visitors to a country , which seems absolutely ridiculous to me . 
  i have no idea how it 's supposed to work . 
  all i know is that in chrome i ca n't get things relying on java to work . 
  they work just fine in safari , so whenever i meet one i just open it up . 
  otherwise safari would never get any use . 
  ( although side note , i also have persistent problems with minecraft because of java . 
  it always has a message saying i should have a 64-bit version in order to go to the ` far ' rendering distance . ), 
  but that 's not what you said . 
  you said that the government should not force people to follow its rules * if that someone was not given a chance to influence the creation of those rules * . 
  tourists can not influence the creation of the laws , and yet if they go there they are subjected to the laws . 
  even so , taking the view that someone who has had their right to vote revoked due to committing a crime should not be subject to any laws is just bizarre . 
  they know when they commit the crime that the law says that will revoke their right to vote . 
  now , i do n't agree that it * should * be that way , but it is and they know it . 
  therefore they knew what they were getting into before they did it , so it 's like a contract , by committing a crime they waived their right to vote , as specified in the contract . 
  and so the rest of the social contract should still be upheld , i.e. , they should still be subject to all the other laws of the country . 
  for anyone wondering , it 's a ` spoiler ' about rumours from the search part 3 . 
  not randomly , that 's what has been suggested to me as the most likely culprit when i went to support forums for help . 
  you are entered into the social contract from birth , and if you know the terms of that . 
  you know that if you commit a crime , there are punishments associated with that , and you understand that you are subject to the laws associated with that . 
  if your country has laws stating that you lose the right to vote by committing a crime , then losing that right is a part of the social contract and you have no right to complain . 
  i 'm not sure that there is any reasonable distinction between ` laws ' and ` legislation ' . 
  the only laws are those passed by parliament . 
  how is it done ? 
  is there some sort of change to the settings that makes this happen , or is the in-game physics by default just flawed so that it allows this ? 
  the surface in the video was completely horizontal , in the video it is angled slightly . 
  that makes all the difference . 
  what is the special ability ? 
  i use lastpass , and they have a web interface as well as a browser-plugin for free . 
  for a paid account ( i think they 're only $ 1 per month , but i do n't do it because i do n't have the need ) you can get a mobile app , and it somehow works with desktop applications , i 'm assuming through a desktop client . 
  i thought mine was bad with 8 characters , letters and numbers only . 
  but damn ... five, 
  its rare that i come across them either , but my maths lecturer linked us to a couple of handy little applets for mathsy things . 
  op 's specific examples are probably usa only , but mvnos are a worldwide thing . 
  i 'm in australia , and i 'm using an mvno on the optus network ( the second biggest network ) , and paying $ 29 per month for unlimited calls , sms , mms , * international * sms , 4 gb data , and `` $ 100 worth of international calls '' . 
  most plans in aus from optus or telstra ( the other big player ) would be $ 40 for a * super * low-end plan , $ 60 if you even want to start getting reasonable amounts of data .

  if you 're on os x ( snow leopard and above definitely , but i 'm pretty sure it 's much older than that ) or windows ( vista or above ) , you can set a folder/selection of images for it to automatically cycle between over a specified interval . 
   i felt like the right side was too empty, 
  that 's cool and all , but in general that 's exactly how i like my wallpapers to be . 
  i do n't like them to be too busy and distracting , personally . 
  going through op 's collection [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dfjwbco.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/egvmgcd.png ) are the only two i 've selected to go into my wallpaper collection , because they are n't too busy and do n't have text ( which i usually try to avoid , too ) . 
  i 've only taken two from this collection into my wallpaper collection , due to my strict need for images that are n't busy , do n't have text , and also have a certain aesthetic quality . 
  here 's my crop of them into a 1.6 aspect ratio .

  uluru is also the name most knowledgeable australians will call it these days , even white ones . 
  completely agree , i feel * much * safer riding on the streets of ho chi minh city than i do in brisbane . 
  in a place where the majority ( though it is quickly decreasing ) of vehicles are motorcycles , being one more two wheeled vehicle is safe , expected , and easy . 
  you missed the point of that article . 
  [ i transcribed this based on what i found on imslp ] ( http://notezilla.io/p/pachelbel/canon ) . 
  i 've played in an orchestra for 6/7 years , and of these 16 pieces the only ones i 've played are beethoven symphony no. 5 , in the hall of the mountain king , 1812 overture , and mars . 
  i 've also played turkish march for myself on piano . 
  eh , if it 's only mildly funny like in this case , it 's worth pointing it out , but probably not worth going to the effort of actually posting it there . 
  i 'm not really familiar with the brahms , but i 'd love to play bolero at some point . 
  but only if it 's the full thing , none of that abridged bullshit . 
  ( though when i played 1812 , that was abridged , and it worked just fine . 
  abridged , * not * just the finale , which would n't be so good . ), 
  william tell , to me , just seems so overplayed , i 'm perfectly happy to have not played it , though i 'd also enjoy it if i did . 
  yeah it was n't really for your sake so much as the casual observer . 
  any estimates as to when we 'll be getting invites ? 
  side note , like that other guy , i do n't think i 've ever heard of bebo before , and yet the name sounds familiar . 
  were any of your products ( in particular the whiteboard ) used outside of your own actual service ? 
  i really like that you 're concentrating on mobile . 
  i 've felt for a long time that facebook has really suffered on mobile , and even with their new chat heads ( which are * awesome * on android ) it still does n't quite feel right . 
  the most important question . 
  holy hell man , that sounds awesome . 
  i am so jealous right now !, 
  obviously nowhere near as bad a mistake , but still significant , hundreds of episodes of doctor who were written over , and are now completely lost . 
  people are talking as though this is referencing a specific story . 
  i thought it was just a general reference to the butterfly effect . 
  could someone let me know what the story is ? 
  it is a thing . 
  check out / r/australia, 
  i 've got to be honest , i hardly use rewards . 
  i rely mainly on my intrinsic desire not to have my character die to keep me doing things , as well as the desire to upgrade my gear ( i.e. , using the built-in rewards ) . 
  i 'm a huge proponent of stv . 
  you would take current electorates/districts and merge them in groups of 4 -- 6 , and each electorate would have 4 -- 6 members , elected using stv , which is proportional . 
  the reason i do n't like mmp and other party-list methods is that they internalise parties into politics , giving parties immense power over which members get into parliament , rather than allowing people to vote for the * people * that they want . 
  cheers . 
  why not do it for pc games excluding steam ? 
  in many cases other vendors ( especially if they 're on sale ) will be cheaper than steam , and doing something like this for pc games would just mean that pc gamers have to check only two sources ( steam and this ) rather than the myriad of options available . 
  da stands for district * attorney * . 
  can we get a mod check on this ? 
  op claims it 's not a violation of rule b , but i ca n't see how it is n't , really . 
  it 's not a rule i agree with , but it 's a rule that 's there , and as far as i can see , this violates it .
