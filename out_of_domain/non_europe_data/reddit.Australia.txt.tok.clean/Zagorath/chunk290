  it 's posts like this that just completely make it impossible for me to take libertarians remotely seriously . 
  essentially , because of your warped view that taxes are exactly equal to robbing someone at gunpoint , and government funding of social programmes ( like healthcare and education ) is done with ` stolen ' money , you would deny a child their * right * to education if they do not come from a wealthy family . 
  you know what happens then ? 
  they are n't educated , and thus ca n't get a job that would allow them to succeed in life and become more wealthy . 
  the cycle perpetuates and you end up with two very distinct classes in society , those who can afford an education , and those who ca n't , with very little mobility between the classes ( except in certain special circumstances ) . 
  so i 'm sorry , but i would rather not deny children their right to primary education just because i think you should have the right to not pay your fair share to give it to them . 
   education is a service that a person delivers, 
  true, 
   it can not be a right of yours if it requires the action of another person, 
  that 's not what rights are . 
  that 's a very narrowly defined negative right , but many positive rights exist , including the right to access to education and medical care . 
   tuition prices have climbed astronomically in the last ten years because of government aid and government guaranteed loans, 
  then the government is going about things the wrong way . 
  that does n't mean the government should n't be doing it at all . 
  in australia , the government gives out hecs loans . 
  a zero-interest ( only indexed to inflation ) loan that is paid back only once you get a job and start getting paid . 
  it works * really * well , and our education prices are much lower than either the us or the uk . 
  i 'm hoping to read this at some point , but i need to meet a deadline for a report , so can someone give me a quick tl ; dr ? 
   i personally had it as a ringtone for quite some time , although that admittedly did cause some issues . 
  i do n't have it set , but my phone seems to always act as though i do . 
  i went from having a 32 gb ipod touch + a ** really ** dumb phone , to having a nexus 4 . 
  the thing i miss most is being able to just dump my entire collection of music on there . 
  i do n't frequently listen to music on my phone , but when i do i want to be able to pick any piece , not just the small selection of favourites that i can afford to leave on there . 
  i 've never understood this argument . 
  not allowing the battery to be removed allows for a significantly larger battery to begin with , meaning longer battery life . 
  if you 're going to be needing more than that anyway ( and let 's face it , a lot of us do ) , you 'll be carrying something in your pocket anyway , so why not make it an external battery pack ? 
  they 're so much more effective than a second battery .

  oh you . 
  drop bears took it . 
  to be fair , the bible is absolutely ** full ** of contradictions , and it 's easy to use the bible to justify either side of the argument . 
  edit : i do n't fromat good . 
  that 's a difficult thing to say , really . 
  i can take me camera , slap an 11 mm lens on it , and take a photo of my computer from where i sit and it 'll come out relatively small looking . 
  then i could take my 200 mm lens and take a close up photo of the person in the building across from me . 
  the same works here , yes saturn is fucking huge , but you ca n't really gather that from this ( or any ) photo . 
  add to that , there are two johann strausses . 
  sure , there are a multitude of bachs known for composing , but the strausses are unique in both being on relatively the same level in their fame . 
  one wrote blue danube , the other wrote the radetzky march . 
  hear , hear . 
  his doctor told him it 's good for him . 
  20c and 10c . 
  because i 'm not in the us . 
  liszt is often ( jokingly ) referred to as ` the first rockstar ' . 
  holy shit . 
  you 're the guy in charge of kickass classical ? 
  i absolutely love what you guys do , and you 've been immensely helpful to me a number of times . 
  the most tangible example , though certainly not the first or only time it happened , was when i was asked to put together a performance for my school 's graduation ceremony . 
  to decide the piece i wanted to perform , i went to your top 100 list and looked for relevant tags , in particular ` formal ' . 
  it was from that that i managed to find a piece and arrange it for the ensemble into [ this performance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5k9cvqwo4q ) . 
  so from mere curiosity , to helping get others into my favourite type of music , to choosing a piece to play in a formal setting , i am so glad that you guys exist . 
  there is no 32 gb nexus 4 . 
  i would have gotten it if it was an option . 
  and i have put all my music into google music , although it was n't available here when i first got my phone . 
  the problem is that streaming a lot of music would use a lot of data ( obviously ) and more importantly , will have * considerable * buffering time . 
  as much as google wants us to use a fully cloud-based system , it 's just no replacement for onboard storage . 
  i think it 's surprising how well the tenuto one managed to capture the spirit of tenuto . 
  edit : oh god , this tumblr page is brilliant !, 
  [ weird time signatures ] ( http://trumpetangst.tumblr.com/post/63004637677/weird-time-signatures ) . 
  i 'm always too late to these things to get gold ... 
  i 've found it does n't seem to be as good at actually waking me up during the right phase of sleep compared to sleep cycle , which is unfortunately only available on ios . 
  what the fuck is up with all the people ` correcting ' you for saying mr manager ? 
  in what context would anyone actually say mr manager * seriously * it 's obvious it 's deliberately meant to be an odd quirk . 
  ah right . 
  i did n't realise it was a reference i was n't getting ... 
  cheers . 
  hahaha , that would be a funny one for a singer to try and do . 
  it 's mainly a string technique , where you play the same note many times rapidly . 
  each stroke across the note indicates half of the note , so with a crotchet and one stroke , it would be quavers , two lines it would be semiquavers , and three strokes would indicate demisemiquavers . 
  same here . 
  heaps of buses , it 's impossible to miss . 
  how do you make a million dollars as a reddit collective ? 
  start with two million . 
  there are alarms that can be set off by cigarette smoke . 
  these alarms are also sometimes called smoke alarms , on account of the fact that it is cigarette * smoke * that sets them off . 
  proof : my college uses them , aeroplanes use them . 
  or it could be three violins and a cello , if you wanted . 
  if tchaikovsky called you a fag , on the other hand , that would probably be a compliment !, 
  to be fair , the symphony was no where near the significant piece of repertoire it is today . 
  beethoven is the one that turned it into such a massive important thing . 
  huh ... wow . 
  i have a good friend named dong . 
  it 's a first name though , not a last name . 
  what 's the building ? 
  asians can be * awful * . 
  a family friend is a white guy married to an ethnic minority girl from central vietnam , and they live in saigon . 
  the viet majority will regularly call out really harsh comments regarding her skin colour ( it 's darker than that of the viets ) . 
  yeah . 
  regardless of whether global warming and climate change are real or not , we * are * running out of fossil fuels , and therefore we * need * to come up with renewable alternatives . 
  the reason pascal 's wager is flawed is that it presumes * christians * have it right . 
  there 's no reason to assume that 's the case . 
  it could just as easily be muslims , or hindus , or even ancient egyptians . 
  or it could be some other higher power that nobody 's thought of yet . 
   unless you 're suggesting we start teaching our kids the ipa, 
  how about korean ? 
  it 's almost completely phonetic , with only the smallest amount of deviations from that . 
  korean is n't purely phonetic , but it 's damn close , and the ways in which it is not phonetic are purely based on basic rules that are * always * followed .
