  e.g. , \uc559 , the first \u3147 is silent , and the second one is similar to the english ` ng ' . 
  this is always the case , \u3147 is silent when in the first position , and makes ` ng ' when at the end of a syllable . 
  i honestly think the korean alphabet is by far the * best * written language that has ever been devised . 
   also food : food is more or less an even percentage of your income . 
  as you make more money you spend more on food . 
  definitely not . 
  food in general is one of the products/services that has the highest income inelasticity of demand in existence . 
  sure , wealthy people eat a bit more than poor people , but the increase in food quantity decreases dramatically as income rises . 
  while quality will continue to increase a lot more than quantity does , even it reaches a limit quickly . 
  the rest of your argument was really good , though . 
  yes , green is a primary colour . 
  the primary colours are red , green , and blue . 
  purple and grey are n't primary , but they are also exceptionally easy , purple ( more properly known as magenta in this context ) is red and blue , while grey is an equal mix of all three primary colours ( but not too close to zero or 255/ff in each colour ) . 
  10 % higher score in your next evaluation ? 
  more importantly , for me as a student , does this mean i get a 10 % boost in all my courses , or just one ? 
  which one ? ~, 
  well if he 's a * really * good lawyer he could * obviously * convince the judge to let him argue both sides . ~, 
  i 've had a few people mention this to me , but no one actually explained what phonemic means ... 
  i thought most people knew that first one ... 
  i certainly did , anyway . 
  what passenger blames the pilot for delays ? 
  that 's just stupid . 
  i 'm a regular flyer ( passenger ) , and i 've never once even considered it the pilot 's problem . 
  i 'll blame the airline , the airport , the weather , but certainly never the pilot . 
  yeah , i 'm really sorry , but i do n't think most musicians care very much about how much you have going on boarding the flight . 
  i 'm lucky that my instrument is small enough to carry on , so i 'm never going to bother you , but a good cello is * really * expensive , and the way ground staff typically treat baggage is horrendous . 
  i know i certainly would n't want to take any risk of my instrument being damaged , and if it makes things a little more difficult , then so be it . 
  well fuck . 
  that 's a lot of videos . 
  i still receive messages all the time . 
  it 's damn annoying and i wish i did n't , because my phone gives a ` missed call ' notification and most of the time the message that they leave is just ` please call be back ' . 
  god damn it , i would have called you back anyway . 
  but anyway , i feel like most people who * are n't * going to leave a message probably hang up after the * start * of the ` answerphone greeting ' , not wait until the end of it . 
  i do n't know exactly what ` crib sheets ' means , but it sounds like something that would fall under best practices . 
  and practising problems is obviously a helpful technique . 
   how would that service the joke , at all ? 
  it would n't , which is why everyone 's disagreeing with him . 
  they moved to australia for this season ? 
  yeah , that 's probably the best time to blame the pilot . 
  holy shit i completely missed that the first time !, 
  edit : for any others , as korra was flying away on the airbison , she flew past [ this island ] ( http://imgur.com/pwuedbt ) . 
  when she flew past the screen , it held the shot on the island for just a tad longer than would be necessary if they were n't trying to make a point . 
  urgh what waaaaiii, 
  episodes 7 and 8 , surely ? 
  no , the final shot of episode 8 was [ this island ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pwuedbt.jpg ) , which looks suspiciously like a submerged lion turtle . 
  it held on to that shot for just a second too long to be a typical end shot . 
  `` dozens of them '' he says . 
  just a friendly tip , the expression is actually `` per se '' . 
  but yeah , i agree , that sounds like a perfectly valid explanation to me . 
  see , that 's kinda what i thought at first , but then with the animals in his shack it seemed that he was actually much nicer , and just was stuck in an unfortunate position . 
  you mean bart allen/impulse from young justice , surely ? 
  ( also a bunch of voices in skyrim , including `` aerin , sven , gwilin , eltrys , onmund , erik , and mikael '' , according to his wikipedia entry ), 
  i thought that looked like a distinctly airbending move , with the circular motions and using your opponents ' strength against them . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'd say this is better than all the atla episodes , but i 'd definitely place it top 5 of the avatar franchise . 
  that 's `` tales of ba sing se '' for anyone who does n't want to look it up . 
  op is talking about atla , not korra . 
  ( i was confused myself at first , because the latest episodes of korra , s02e07-08 , were also really feelsy . ), 
  i 've never flown anywhere when time was a concern , but when you 're travelling for over 24 hours to get somewhere , any delays and you start getting irrational anyway . 
  still is n't an excuse for taking it out on people who are n't at fault , though . 
  wan is the name of the first avatar . 
  juan is n't even pronounced the same , it 's got a ` h ' sound to it . 
  yeah that 's what i thought . 
  other threads ( particularly the official and reaction ones ) made a big deal out of it , and i was honestly confused as to how it was n't just completely obvious . 
  no he was n't . 
  the fire lord pretty specifically talks about how he wants to unite humanity to create a better world . 
  sure he 's deranged and wrong , but he thinks he 's doing the best thing . 
   could 've of, 
  roku states ( when trying to convince the firebending master to teach aang firebending before he has mastered water and earth ) that he 's learnt it a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes . 
  i dunno , i -- as someone who has no actual expertise in the area -- ca n't think of any way in which it could be the pilot 's fault . 
  i can see regulations imposed by the airline or the airport being the cause , i can see it being other passengers ' faults , or simply that the weather was impossible to take off in . 
  i ca n't see any way that the pilot could be on the plane and making announcements , and yet it 's still his fault . 
  how so ? 
  someone in another posited that there could have been other convergences since wan 's , making this more than 10,000 years after wan 's time . 
  another person suggested that by locking him up as he did , the next convergence could have been delayed past the usual 10,000 year cycle . 
  i recognised him as impulse from young justice . 
  but korra will beat him at the end of this season ( at least it appears that way ) , which means it does n't have the long build-up to that moment . 
  just a minor correction , you mean episodes 7 and 8 , not 6 and 7 . 
   eating goodbye to passengers for delays, 
  i want to understand this so badly ... 
   why would the avatar be needed during a time of animal bending and lion turtles ? 
  huh ? 
  they are n't . 
  we quite clearly saw in episodes 7 and 8 that the first avatar was created during the time of lion turtles , and that during his lifetime , the lion turtles decided to no longer give out the power of bending . 
  i agree , nexus 7 is a * much * better device , and should also be cheaper anyway . 
  but he did n't say whether he wants to be enlightened or resistance !, 
  episodes 1 and 2 were released simultaneously , which may have thrown some people out . 
  i do n't know what avatarchapters is , but [ here 's the wikipedia page on korra episodes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_legend_of_korra_episodes#book_two:_spirits_.282013.29 ) . 
  [ here , also , is the avatar wiki ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_the_legend_of_korra_episodes#book_two:_spirits ) . 
  the latest two episodes were 7 and 8 . 
  yeah good point , actually . 
  side note , up until now i had always assumed the avatar world was flat ... 
  what ? 
  no , it * is * a two party system . 
  just because there is n't a chapter of the constitution that says `` there will always be two political parties '' , does n't mean it is n't . 
  because the voting system is first past the post , if an individual votes for a small party which has very little chance of winning , that individual has * wasted * their vote . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo ) . 
  what ? 
  he basically voted strongly in favour of every pro-gun legislation . 
  absolutely * awful * on every account . 
  yeah , that 's libertarian .
