  it 's interesting to find out why it is , but that interest is not relevant to this argument . 
  holy fuck , i know right . 
  all these butt-hurt car drivers complaining about shit that they do n't know one ounce about . 
  i do n't think an / r/askreddit thread has ever made me so angry out of sheer ignorance . 
  never heard of it being a problem here in aus , either , or in vietnam when i lived there . 
  sounds like some drivers need to learn what blinkers are for . 
  and besides , closest park \u2260 closest opportunity to run on a good trail . 
  my dad did most of the shopping when i was in highschool . 
  parents shared the cooking as well . 
  the placebo effect also exists . 
  and it is * very * real . 
  even if it 's confirmation bias that makes people feel more comfortable running on the road , * they feel more comfortable running on the road * . 
  whether he 's right or not , he 's being an arse . 
  `` get on the damn sidewalk where you belong '' is a deliberately rude way of putting his statement . 
  another car ? 
  a bus ? 
  a truck ? 
  where the hell are you talking about ? 
  nobody 's going to argue that runners should run on the main highway . 
  quite suburban streets never get that much traffic . 
  any time there 's a significant amount of traffic , sure , i 'll pop up onto the footpath , but for one occasional car going past , it 's not an issue . 
  where i am , there 's absolutely no law against it . 
  and wow , that last paragraph of yours makes you just as much of an arse as the previous guy . 
  no , more so , because honestly , even pretending that you would run over someone is something that only a complete fuckhead would do . 
  you could dry yourself pretty quickly with air or firebending too . 
  in general i agree . 
  but watch s02e07-08 before you come to too much of a conclusion . 
  because holy shit , i would rate among the best episodes out of the whole avatar franchise . 
  i 'm gon na go with kyoshi 's time , just because roku 's time was too close to the 100 year war . 
  i do n't know what the coles song was , but there 's no way it could possibly be more annoying than [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wryluu1njm8 ) , which was played regularly in e-marts in korea . 
  that said , i really missed it when they stopped playing it ... 
  not really . 
  podcasts are specifically things downloaded using a particular type of feed ( typically rss ) . 
  the type of content is usually different , too , being usually either informative ( news related or educational ) or literary . 
  think of podcasts as radio , but you download it to listen when you want . 
  you can also have video podcasts , or vodcasts . 
  i do n't understand why everyone 's getting so butthurt over this one simple off-hand joke . 
  oh that 's really cool !, 
  i might have to look into doing it some time in the next couple of years . 
  i think you 're missing op 's position . 
  op is n't in favour of extreme socialism , very few rational people are ( just as very few rational people follow the more extreme tenants of libertarianism ) . 
  just a moderate amount of wealth redistribution , maybe the same amount that currently exists in op 's country , maybe a bit more . 
  nowhere in op 's post did they mention anything about ` smashing the system ' or being ` oppressed ' in any way . 
   but the consumers have won, 
  in the short term . 
  but what happens next ? 
  the big company raises prices because they have a monopoly . 
  maybe at some point down the road someone else will try to step in to compete , only to have the large company temporarily lower their prices below what the smaller company can afford . 
  after a while , people will recognise that there 's no chance of entering this market because of the tactics , and will simply stop trying . 
  yeah , it really is quite incredible how many people here are just talking completely out of their arse . 
  this entire thread is just bullshit . 
  heaps of people with no experience in running joining in with complaining about anyone who is n't in a big petrol-guzzling machine using ` their ' roads . 
  you see the same thing any time cyclists on roads gets brought up . 
  drivers ( as a collective ) hate everyone who does n't conform to their standard expectation of a road user . 
  trucks , pedestrians , cyclists , and runners included . 
  i 'm not saying it does n't * matter * . 
  in fact , i went on to state that it 's worth finding out what it is . 
  the point is , though , that once you have a dataset that says [ something ] , then you know [ something ] is true . 
  the task is then to find out why , not to go around making bald claims that [ something ] is n't true , which is what 's happening in this thread . 
  a bunch of people with no experience running making claims related to running , not based on * evidence * to the contrary , but merely assumptions and a lack of * hard * evidence the other way . 
  the discussion is about how it affects runners . 
  are you implying that the psychological impacts on a runner 's style based on the feel underfoot of the surface are n't real ? 
  because believe me , they are . 
  even if scientifically the properties of the ground are the same , if it psychologically feels different to the runner , then that 's the pertinent point . 
  all this talk about ` unsafe behaviour ' is what 's inane . 
  no one is actually running down a major highway . 
  the relevant discussion is in suburban streets where the level of traffic is relatively low , and there is n't actually any risk involved . 
  no because in this case it 's so bad , the joke hit him right in the head and he still did n't notice it . 
  no i 'm sorry , but your government has no right to be spying on me or my family any more than it has the right to spy on you . 
  in fact , it has less right to do that , on account of it being your government , not mine . 
  how is it a hypocrite ? 
  it 's only hypocritical if he supports the same actions in his own government , which he just explicitly said he does n't . 
  no , there 's no cognitive dissonance . 
  i 'm a huge supporter of australian senator scott ludlum , because he 's taken a hard stance against mass spying by australian government agencies . 
  because i do n't support the fact that my government could be spying on innocent civilians from either my country or others . 
  equally , i think it is disgusting that the us is spying on its own citizens , and those of other countries . 
  and i 'll speak out against it any chance i get . 
  now , you might disagree with me and say that it 's ok to invade people 's privacy for reasons of ` national security ' , or whatever . 
  you have every right to state that . 
  it is ** not ** , however , cognitive dissonance in ** any ** way . 
  wrong type of cookies . 
  i was speaking in a general sense about spying , but even so , i do n't think countries should be spying on the governments of other countries which they do not have a reasonable expectation of threat from . 
  he 's not talking about what he actually thought the us was . 
  he was speaking facetiously about how far from the ideal which the us tries to portray itself as the us actually is . 
   the mexican president is not an `` innocent civilian '', 
  very good point . 
  i was , admittedly , speaking in a broader sense about the nsa spying . 
  often in these discussions , it seems americans on reddit are perfectly happy to accept ( or , more accurately , ignore ) spying on actual innocent citizens from other countries and only worry about spying on american citizens . 
  for that reason , i try to bring it to people 's minds . 
  however , mexico is not a country that the us is at war with , and there 's no reasonable expectation that mexico will at any point in the near future be a threat . 
  so for that reason i do n't think that the us should be doing spying of this scale . 
   who the fuck do you think espionage agencies should spy on then ? 
  suspected terrorists -- those suspected of * actual * terrorist involvements , not whistleblowers -- governments of countries which actually are current or suspected threats . 
  the only reason the un was able to go to war with north korea ( the only time in its history it has truly * gone to war * ) was that russia did n't attend that security council meeting due to disagreements over previous un decisions . 
  needless to say , russia has not missed a unsc meeting since . 
  well , not * technically * . 
  i could be wrong , but i 'd assume that if they wanted , they could vote against something without vetoing it . 
  maybe if they wanted to show a disagreement but not a particularly strong one . 
   i defiantly do n't think that a totally democratic government is a good thing, 
  i 'm not sure i 'd call it a defiant belief  not many people would disagree with that .
