  hi from australia . 
  our last election was between right wing , and right wing with good internet . 
  i prefer to classify things using the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) . 
  it removes the ambiguity that seems to be going on in this thread . 
  in that sense , ` promoting gun ownership ' would not have any placement . 
  it 's a pretty neutral move , unless it 's done by handing out subsidies to gun owners . 
  however , * banning guns * , or restricting them , would technically be classed as an `` authoritarian '' policy . 
  that said , most of the time gun policies are the inverse of other policies . 
  typically ` libertarian ' ( with a lower case l , to not confuse it with the extremist libertarian views in economics ) parties more often are in favour of gun restrictions . 
  e.g. , the democrats in the us are far more likely to propose gun restrictions than the republicans . 
  i do n't actually have much of an opinion on this issue , but at least according to someone further up in the thread , scotland actually gets more money back from the uk than it collects in taxes . 
  ah yes , fair enough . 
  yeah , the korean alphabet is phonemic , then . 
  the point being , though , the korean alphabet is by far the easiest in the world to learn to read and pronounce . 
  and yeah , it would n't work easily from other languages into korean without significant changes , but i 'm not sure that 's a particularly huge problem . 
  it 's pretty easy to do . 
  i have n't seen many trek films ( only the tng tv series ) but from what i 've read online , most people seem to regard wrath of khan as the best movie . 
  i have to know , why did shatner personally tell you not to go see a screening ? 
  not usually . 
  that 's an unusual quirk of the us president . 
  it 's actually `` hear , hear '' . 
  shortened from `` hear him , hear him '' . 
  hear , hear !, 
  the star wars films are good , but none of them are truly * great * films . 
  they have obvious plot holes , it 's clear lucas was making the story up as he went along , and the thematic devices were n't shown as well as they could have been . 
  i only found out that they were trying to show how luke almost went to the dark side when i read about machete order , before that it never even occurred to me that that was their intention . 
  depending on how you want to define bending , we clearly saw elemental bending in korra s02e07-08 . 
  have you watched those ? 
  yeah , i would agree with that . 
  i do n't think bringing energybending into it is particularly relevant , though . 
  we have n't seen much of that at all , certainly there was none of that ( shown ) in the time of wan . 
  but yeah , i would define bending as the artform rather than merely a crude ability to manipulate the element . 
  it allows for the origin stories of bending ( as being taught by the three animals + the moon ) to make sense . 
  i dunno , it seemed to me like he would n't have claimed himself as fire nation royalty . 
  looked like he was trying to unify humanity to the end of his life . 
   the lion turtles were probably energybending when they gave people the power of the element . 
  perhaps there 's no other use for energybending . 
  true , but that would n't account for the statement in tla that bending the energy within themselves was the only form of bending pre-elemental bending . 
   and s07 alludes to this when wan actually learns firebending from a dragon . 
  yeah i loved that touch . 
  wow , that 's an awesome story . 
  honestly , it sounds like shatner was just being a dick , which i think is something i 've seen pointed out before . 
  matilda is a cult-classic ? 
  i think nearly any person i ask would know it . 
  side note , i hate how the movie ended it , with her retaining her powers . 
  having her lose them because she was having her mind stimulated enough in school was a much better ending . 
  op , you should totally adopt the kid !, 
  ( make sure to get the parents to leave the country by having them implicated in some sort of crime , first . ), 
  yeah , so would i. 
  i do wonder if something like it has n't already been done , but i 'm not sure what keywords to put into the academic search engine . 
  mmm , that 's a possibility , but it seems unlikely to me . 
  still , i agree , so much more to know . 
  i really hope they find some way to give us more information about him . 
  huh ? 
  i just meant if he wants to go to this event specifically . 
  of course you 'd ignore the advice if you wanted to travel before then ( which , fwiw , i would highly encourage anyone do ) . 
  ah fair enough . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  no , i went to school overseas . 
  how curious . 
  no , in australia all standard adult passports are 10 years , only those under 18 or over 75 get 5 year passports . 
  what sort of biometrics do you guys have on yours ? 
  in aus the only one used is the proportions of the face , which do n't really change much . 
  i have to say , there 's a lot of things about abbott that i greatly respect . 
  being a volunteer firefighter and his focus on fitness ( is he our first ironman prime minister ? 
  i think so ... ) are certainly up there . 
  in those respects , he 's a good role model . 
  even if i disagree strongly with his political stances , i can respect other things about the guy . 
  as / u/sithjustgotreal said , you got the spelling all correct . 
  just remember your capitalisation next time !, 
  i have to agree , there were major flaws in the movie . 
  i 'm pretty sure the reused the same clip of a building being destroyed more than once . 
  the fact that they made it so dark was my biggest problem . 
  to me , superman is n't a dark hero in the way batman is , and they 're trying to get a boost out of the popularity of the really dark nolan batman films , but it does n't suit the character . 
  also the music , why williams did n't return to do it , i do n't know , but i really wish he had . 
  zimmer just is n't the right composer to be doing superhero films , especially not superman . 
  the soundtrack to the latest film was just completely forgettable . 
  actual nsfw content is n't allowed in this subreddit . 
  there are other subreddits for avatar-related nsfw if you wan na look for them . 
  yeah ours has that same more rigid page with a warning to treat it like you would any piece of electronics e.g. 
  do n't bend it . 
  but i do n't think the electronics are powered at all , so they ca n't run out of power ... 
  i 'm not sure since i was too young before , but i imagine prices went up here too . 
  multi-computers is even better . 
  can play a game on one and have something active in the other , and using the second one does n't forcibly minimise the game . 
  does anyone have a video of what 's actually going on in this scene ? 
  if a = b then b = a , but using implies does n't follow in the same way . 
  you get used to it pretty quickly . 
  although it is kinda funny until then . 
  do n't most people know yakety sax ? 
  or at least by the name benny hill theme . 
  i 've had the same happen many times . 
  not with my own compositions ( which i do n't remember ever having claims against , but it may have happened ) , but with my performances of * public domain * music . 
  the copyright claim came from some generic copyright holder whose name was something like `` musical composition rights society '' . 
  in one particularly heinous case , a different agency ( the `` harry fox agency '' , who are nothing but absolute ** scum ** ) tried to launch a copyright strike against one of my recordings . 
  they did n't even have a copyright strike against the right * piece * . 
  i was playing piece a , in the public domain . 
  they put a copyright strike against piece b , which is * also * in the public domain * anyway * . 
  the entire copyright system on youtube is ** thoroughly broken ** , and seriously needs an absolute overhaul . 
  since you 're likely to see the streisand effect pop up regularly soon , i 'd like to point out that when you do , that 's a case of the baader-meinhof phenomenon .
