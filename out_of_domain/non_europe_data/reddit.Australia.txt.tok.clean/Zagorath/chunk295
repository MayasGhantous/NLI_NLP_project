  umm . 
  maybe you should go back and reread my comment ? 
  i specifically used the term `` extreme '' socialism to refer to not the sort of socialism you described , but a fully ( or close to fully ) controlled market . 
  the sort of socialism you described in your comment is actually exactly what i support as a lefty . 
  i 've had the same happen many times with my performances of * public domain * music . 
  the copyright claim came from some generic copyright holder whose name was something like `` musical composition rights society '' . 
  in one particularly heinous case , a different agency ( the `` harry fox agency '' , who are nothing but absolute ** scum ** ) tried to launch a copyright strike against one of my recordings . 
  they did n't even have a copyright strike against the right * piece * . 
  i was playing piece a , in the public domain . 
  they put a copyright strike against piece b , which is * also * in the public domain * anyway * . 
  the entire copyright system on youtube is ** thoroughly broken ** , and seriously needs an absolute overhaul . 
  i 'm going to take the meta response to this and say that the reason he was n't killed upon capture is because '' [ otherwise the play would be over , stupid !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/r9lcwi5iere?t=9m4s ) '', 
  sure , it does n't explain it in-universe , and it 's not particularly adequate , but it does explain why the creators of the story needed to make up some excuse for them not to kill him . 
  from this you can then debate the in-universe reasons . 
  more importantly , why do you need to learn subtraction ? 
  this is really interesting . 
  the video ( and audio , to a lesser extent ) quality on this is no where near as good as what trey ratcliff has been getting on his glass videos , and i wonder why . 
  i do n't want you to watch the whole ted talk , just roughly the 1 minute 10 seconds from where i linked . 
  heck , i could have linked [ to here ] ( http://youtu.be/r9lcwi5iere?t=9m41s ) , and it would 've been about 30 seconds , ending at about 10:18 , to make it shorter . 
  edit : that said , this is a really good talk , and it is worth watching , but outside of that short extract , it is n't relevant to the conversation at hand . 
  umm , mods ? 
  why was a delta not awarded for this ? 
  it 's not that important anyway . 
  it 's a guy basically comparing a piece of chopin , and the way it restates the main theme , to hamlet , and how he has many opportunities to kill claudius but does n't . 
  sure you can come up with in-universe explanations for it , but fundamentally , the reason is because `` otherwise the play would be over , stupid ! '', 
  i 'm not sure i understand your aversion to ted talks , though . 
  in general they contain some amazing content . 
  i ca n't speak for most people , but i just do n't * notice * ads unless they 're overly obnoxious . 
  even the big banner on the youtube homepage , i usually just click the `` subscriptions '' button on the left without looking at it . 
  the only ads that have any effect for me are the video preroll ones . 
  and even then , if you do n't grab my attention in the first two seconds , i 'll ctrl + tab to another browser tab until the video finishes playing , so i do n't notice them . 
  the audio ads inserted into my podcasts are * really * effective , though . 
  ones presented by the host of the show , so that not only is it advertising , but it comes from someone that i trust . 
  they 're also awkward to skip , so more often than not i * do * listen to them . 
  i even choose to listen and pay attention whenever it 's a new advertiser , because who knows , it could actually be interesting . 
  that , to me , is the perfect way to do ads . 
  that 's what got me to block them to , but then recently a few major youtubers started speaking out about how little money they were making , and how they had to cater their videos specifically to get large audiences rather than just making the best videos they can . 
  then i removed adblock entirely , and i occasionally click on ads just for the sake of improving their ctr . 
  i just switch to another tab while waiting for the video ads , it 's not that big a deal . 
  but it 's completely true . 
  sure there are artistic reasons behind it too , but fundamentally any piece or work has to reach a certain length , and the artist has to work out how to achieve a suitable length in a creative way . 
  shakespeare does this very well on hamlet by causing the titular character to be hesitant as he is , just like chopin extends the length of his piece by essentially going back to the beginning . 
  that 's an interesting question , and i , too , would like to see a solid answer to it . 
  i would guess it 's to do with how he looks -- his eccentric look fits in with our ideal notion of what a ` scientist ' should be . 
  also , the fact that his most famous theory can be boiled down to one really simple , easily memorable equation , e = mc ^ 2, 
  here 's the thing , the xbox has always been * much * bigger in the us than in most of the rest of the world . 
  as / u/iicvx said , this generation they 're going further by having heaps of features that make it almost useless outside of the us , unless they can managed to get the same content deals there , which is less likely . 
  beyond : two souls can be played by two people co-op . 
  one person plays jodie , the other aidan . 
  that 's what my friend who 's played it told me , anyway . 
  side note , they really should have done this with last of us , too . 
  are you that guy from the warlizard gaming forums ? 
  and then there 's the people who know it exists but do n't wan na be douches denying websites the ability to generate revenue , because we want the sites to be able to continue doing what they do . 
  google is n't close to the nsa . 
  [ the nsa is taking data from behind google 's back , without their permission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1garzb/steve_gibson_of_security_now_explains_prism_the/ ) . 
   and i do n't have bnw yet steam sale wo n't come soon enough, 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  i only just got gods & kings a week or so ago ... 
  ah that 's a shame . 
  the podcasts i listen to are mainly tech news , and the majority of the ones i listen to are from the twit network , which has an explicit policy of only taking sponsorship from companies whose products they actually use . 
  the host has a way of making them interesting , not like he 's just reading out the ad script . 
  i usually do skip , although i have enough trust in them to listen occasionally , especially when it 's a new advertiser . 
  ah thanks , i did n't know that . 
  my main exposure to comic characters is through tv and film . 
  in the case of dc , it 's mainly young justice , as well as memories of teen titans and justice league from ages ago ( though i have n't watched either of those in years ) . 
  i 'm also a huge fan of arrow , and i loved the nolan batman films . 
  from my memories from justice league , as well as from young justice ( which is itself quite a dark show ) , i got the impression superman was n't a very dark character . 
  he had his problems , of course , but i would never have classed him as dark in those stories . 
  nice to know that the comics make him a bit more three dimensional . 
  that said , i wo n't read them because i do n't like the way the comics are made so convoluted . 
  one character will have multiple different comics about them , and they 'll be interrelated in confusing ways , and then there 's the combined timelines with other characters etc. 
  it all just seems like far too much for me . 
  mmm , thanks . 
  a couple of people have mentioned free/open list . 
  it certainly seems interesting , and i do n't really feel like i fully understand it yet , so i wo n't completely pass judgement . 
  that said , removing geographical representation entirely seems a poor implementation to me , rather than just lessening it slightly by increasing the sizes of electorates ( merging 4 -- 6 ) . 
  it 's not a huge problem though , and if it solves other things than it 's worth it . 
  the other problem i still wonder about , though , is how it relates to independents . 
  would n't it be harder to get in as an independent due to votes for one party all being combined ? 
  i 'm not sure i like the way parties are an official part of the system , though it 's still a lot better than party-list methods . 
  i 've always had bad handwriting , but it 's only recently that i started to realise that it 's largely due to my handedness . 
  i write hook-handed , and it definitely does n't feel right , but i 've tried doing the slanted paper thing and that just feels weird . 
  sort of similar to how handshakes in western culture mean that you ca n't draw your sword , since your hand is empty and occupied . 
   my favorite episode in the entire episode, 
  ( you make a great point , though . ), 
   student, 
  there 's your problem . 
  also hey !, 
  also a student in an it-related field ( software engineering , in my case ) . 
  i got ta be honest , i disagree with pretty much your entire second paragraph . 
  it seemed pretty clear to me what was going on , and i just thought it was this epic moment where he * removes someone 's bending * , which is such a momentous thing to do . 
  i agree * completely * with how it was handled in korra , though . 
  it felt shallow . 
  the only thing i would say is that i do n't think they had another option . 
  they had to give people back their bending , and it would n't have been easy to write it into the story in an interesting way . 
  but are n't the la vie ^ \u00ae water cooler \u2122 discussions just the best ? 
  facebook gets shat on because they 're dicks with your data . 
  they change settings and in general give people a sense that you ca n't * trust * them to keep your data private . 
  people * trust * google , and with good reason .
