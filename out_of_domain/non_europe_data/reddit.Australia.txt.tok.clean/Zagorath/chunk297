  / s , although it would be interesting to do a quick survey regarding it . 
  enlightened . 
  it 's to do with facebook changing settings and revealing information that should be private . 
  they 've had too many slip ups to be fully trustworthy still, 
  they also are n't as public and open about what changes they 're making as google is . 
  take the latest thing , where your face can be shown on google + to your friends on things you 've +1 d. 
  it 's been impossible to miss google 's alerts that they 're doing this , and it 's really easy to opt out if you wish . 
  i 've also heard a lot of people say that facebook 's equivalent of this * lies * . 
  it puts your face in the ad for things you * have n't * ` liked ' . 
  i vaguely remember hearing something about that . 
  honestly , i find it difficult to entertain any of japan 's claims of ownership . 
  there really seems to be a pattern of them claiming territory that others are also claiming . 
  how is this anti-america ? 
  it seems to me to be defending japan 's warnings based on the fact that the us does it to . 
  in other words , it 's pro us . 
  i wish you luck in that endeavour . 
  my agent id is the same as my reddit username , if that helps . 
  such a shame to see what appears an intelligent young mind perverted such that it would attempt to hinder the progression of humanity that has been going on for thousands of years thanks to shaper guidance . 
  us only , unfortunately . 
   china , on the other hand , has over 30 territorial claims on other land , some of which is no where near them and there is no political connection to china . 
  it even claims whole countries as its own . 
  yeah good point . 
  taiwan , obviously , but also a huge amount of the south china sea . 
  [ this image was floating around the web a little while ago ] ( http://thelastcolumnist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/spratlyscarboroughshoalmap.gif ) . 
  according to the article most often cited regarding baader-meinhof ,, 
   how the phenomenon came to be known as `` baader-meinhof '' is uncertain . 
  it seems likely that some individual learned of the existence of the historic german urban guerrilla group which went by that name , and then heard the name again soon afterwards . 
  this plucky wordsmith may then have named the phenomenon after the very subject which triggered it . 
  but it is certainly a mouthful ; a shorter name might have more hope of penetrating the lexicon . 
  not that great . 
  i pay $ 29 a month to vaya ( optus mvno ) and get unlimited calls and sms ( including international sms ) , $ 100 worth of international calls , and 4 gb data . 
  amaysim offers a $ 39.90 per month with 4 gb data , and unlimited calls & sms . 
  aldi 's is still a good deal , but it 's gone from amazing and a leader in its class for certain instances , to being significantly behind competitors . 
  take a look at [ vaya ] ( http://www.vaya.net.au/ ) and [ amaysim ] ( http://www.amaysim.com.au/ ) , both optus mvnos with different advantages and disadvantages . 
  vaya 's $ 18 gives unlimited sms , 1.5 gb of 4g data , and `` $ 650 '' worth of calls ( excluding vaya-to-vaya , 1300 , 1800 etc. 
  ) , at a rate of $ 2.15 per 2 minute call . 
  amaysim has $ 19.90 with 500 mb 3g data , `` $ 19.90 '' worth of calls and sms at 9 cents / sms , 18 cents / 2 min call , 29 cents / min to 13 and 18 numbers . 
  vaya has $ 37 with 2 gb data and `` $ 850 '' calls at the same rate as above , or $ 52 with unlimited call and sms and 3 gb data . 
  amaysim $ 39.90 gives unlimited calls and sms , plus 4 gb data . 
  if data does n't matter to you , vaya also has `` skinny '' plans , with higher rates of call , but only 100 mb data . 
  all plans on vaya allow tethering/hotspotting , and i * assume * amaysim does too , but i ca n't find anything about it on their site . 
  i 'm with vaya on a plan that 's way better than any that they currently offer , but i can say that their customer service has been incredible on their facebook page , both public posts and private messages ( email service , on the other hand , was subpar , and i 've never tried any other type ) . 
  if you decide to go with a vaya plan , could you send me a pm ? 
  they have a referral programme and it 'd save me some money . 
  i had just assumed it would be like glenn gould 's infamous humming . 
  seriously op , you absolutely * must * play ** last of us ** . 
  it 's got perhaps the most moving gaming experience and story of any game i know of . 
  characters that you 'll really care for , put into situations that will make you experience far more emotion than you ever have before in a game . 
  it 's not exactly patientgamer material quite yet , being relatively new , but it 's definitely worth looking for discounted copies if you can . 
  rule 1, 
  i agree with you on everything except fire drills . 
  you could test the alarms less regularly , requiring closed doors is excessive , etc. 
  but fire drills are important . 
  in the event a fire occurs , the single most important thing is that people can get out of there fast enough and safely enough . 
  for this , people need to know what to do in the event of a fire , and this is what fire drills are for . 
  they force people to get educated on the best fire escape routes , where to meet up after escaping the building ( so that everyone can be accounted for , and you know that everyone has safely escaped the building ) , and by repetition it increases the efficiency at which everyone can do these things . 
  if these were monthly that would be excessive , but 2 -- 4 times a year is enough to keep people aware of what they need to be doing . 
  this is a good compromise between the safety of hundreds of lives , and the inconvenience associated with it . 
   the only point i need to make is that the athletes in nfl are far superior, 
  huh ? 
  you ca n't just state that the `` athletes ... are far superior '' . 
  in what area are they superior ? 
  why ? 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  how can you claim that the people / u/caw81 mentioned are not famous ? 
  maybe not all of them ( i 've never heard of ina garten ) , but at least some of them are incredibly famous . 
  goldberg is a famous actor and singer -- perhaps the most stereotypical role for a ` celebrity ' to take . 
  and , no offense meant to her , she 's far from attractive to most eyes . 
  adele is not exactly ` ugly ' , but she is somewhat overweight , which is seen to most of society as a negative visual trait . 
  her singing , however , is phenomenal , and she rocketed to stardom based on that alone . 
  or how about susan boyle , who actually is n't all that great a singer , but became famous thanks to a british talent show . 
  she 's not attractive , and in fact became famous in part * because * of how unattractive she is . 
  it was a novelty . 
  nicki minaj is , in my opinion at least , the single ugliest human being on the face of the earth . 
  and yet , despite this , she somehow has ( apparently ) become extremely famous . 
  it is easy to find female celebrities that are both famous ( and i specifically stuck to only extremely well-known names here ) , and considered unattractive to the majority of the population . 
  this directly contradicts your statement . 
  [ i do n't think you know what that actually means . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exception_that_proves_the_rule ), 
  how do to * counterexamples * prove the original statement ? 
  what ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  finding more and more counterexamples to your original claim does not , and * can not * prove your argument . 
  the statement that there are tens of mileys for every adele is a different claim , but the existence of counterexamples does not * help * that claim in any way . 
  no , but you did imply that for whatever reason you were discounting them from your definition of famous . 
  but they are famous , and more importantly it is easy to find a lot of females who are famous despite being unattractive . 
  ditto , i had never been anywhere near markarth before that quest . 
  this is a problem of your workplace not treating them correctly , and i agree it 's incredibly bad doing this . 
  but if they were done * properly * , it would be a good way of going about fire safety . 
  [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuynhkal1i ) , i think , does an incredible job of analysing what 's great about morrowind that oblivion was lacking . 
  it 's rather long , and he does n't get onto that particular matter until about halfway in , but it 's well worth the watch . 
  personally i use lol , lol , haha , haha , and various other amounts of ` ha ' or ` ha ' in different cases . 
  i do n't have an exact rule for it , though . 
  really handy tip , but i feel most people probably know this one ... 
  i learnt it in primary school , for example . 
  i do that sometimes , but only when i forget i 've switched by keyboard to qwerty ( i normally use dvorak , ` h ' on dvorak is in the same spot as ` j' on qwerty ) and do it by accident . 
  this is awesome , but i 'd like to put out a friendly reminder to people that it 's always good to wait until the second point release until you update . 
  initial apple releases usually have bugs , and the first minor update will fix some , but often introduce a few more . 
  wait until mac os x 10.9.2 ( or 10.9.0.2 , whichever it is ) until you update . 
  this is awesome , but i 'd like to put out a friendly reminder to people that it 's always good to wait until the second point release until you update .
