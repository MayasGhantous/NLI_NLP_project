  i just wish i knew where the source was for that . 
  wow ... that 's terrible ... 
  and people really just lose interest once they turn 18 ? 
  what a selfish society ... 
  i rather enjoyed watching [ toby turner 's series ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzq1u5giadc ) . 
  his personality can get annoying when exposed to too much , though . 
  show off ;p, 
  i love that site , but mozart did n't write out cadenzas for this concerto , so they 're not in that link . 
  i 'll write up the two that i 've got on the weekend . 
  i wo n't have time till then , i 'm very busy with school . 
  one 's the more commonly done one , but i find it rather dull . 
  the second seems really virtuosic ( although it 's actually rather easy ) , but is less ` traditional ' . 
  i 'll give you them both and let you decide which to use . 
  i have a friend who did his [ extended essay ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extended_essay ) ( a part of the ib diploma , separate from studied subjects ) on the ` psychological effects of games ' . 
  not quite the same thing , but very close :p, 
  by the way , awesome presentation . 
  what was the criteria/topic for this presentation ? 
  oh , and i 'm not sure i agree with all cultures having a concept of dragons . 
  i think that we use the same english word to describe them , collectively , is simply because we need a word to describe them . 
  i ca n't say much for the other types , but the chinese concept of a dragon is completely different from the european . 
  they do n't have wings ( usually ) , they are long and serpent like , and are associated with good luck . 
  european dragons are a force of evil and destruction , and have a completely different physical appearance . 
  man ... sorry i went on so long about something so pointless - . -, 
  so was i !!!, 
  i even turned up my graphics settings just for the occasion !, 
  am i the only one that really prefers the visual aesthetic of the vanilla skyrim over most of these mods ? 
  please post as a reply here , 
  lol, 
  i 'm procrastinating doing my tok essay right now ... 
  sigh ... only 82 days until i 'm done for good ... 
  by the way , what was your ee on ? 
  personally i definitely prefer the original ones , even on the screenshots you mentioned . 
  still , i do agree , it 's great that they make it so easy for people to mod their game . 
  before i do , i need to know what key you 're playing in ? 
  the concerto is originally written for a clarinet in a , so if you play it on a bb clarinet you have two options . 
  one is to play a semitone lower , so that it will have the same sound . 
  the other is to play as originally written , but it will sound a semitone too high . 
  personally , i went for the latter option , because it 's ** incredibly ** hard to play lowered a semitone . 
  if you 're not sure which you 're doing , tell me what notes it starts and ends on . 
  if it starts on a c and ends on fs , then you 're playing as originally * written * . 
  if you start on a b and end on es , then yours will * sound * the same as the original . 
  on an actual clarinet in a ? 
  wow , really cool !, 
  i wish i could have the opportunity to do the same !, 
  one flat in the key signature ? 
  lol , you forgot like , all of australia hehehe, 
  but thanks for this information , really interesting points , 
  here 's a pdf with both of them :, 
  and an mp3 with a recording of something similar to the second one :, 
  it wo n't be identical , though , because they 're playing on a basset clarinet , which can go down to ( at least ) a c below bottom e . so the very bottom part goes down lower , and the bit with the turns is slightly different . 
  the cadenzas in these two recordings may also help . 
  the cadenzas begin at around 3:15 and 4:15 , respectively . 
  ( again , the one with the second cadenza is played slightly differently to what is in the score ) . 
  if you can record your performance , i 'd love to see a video of it , 
  ah , very cool . 
  i hope you 'll share the results with this page , i 'm very interested to see them !, 
  the pdf you shared , is that a draft of your study , or the study published last year that you mentioned ? 
  i never knew this was the case ( i 'm new ) , would you mind explaining why it is ? 
  i 'm coming to the end of my second year using a ti-84 plus in ib maths and physics hl , and i 've had to replace the battery twice so far . 
  most of my friends , on the other hand , have not changed very much at all . 
  til : ios expands the tappable area of a keyboard for letters it predicts you are more likely to type next . 
  i wan na know what the crossed out options were . 
  am i the only one ? 
  i 've read ~ ~ all the books ~ ~ the first three books in the wicked series , and i absolutely loved them . 
  i expected a lion among men to be dull , but it was just as good as the previous two books !, 
  i have no interest in musicals generally , but i would love to see wicked if i got the opportunity , just because i know how awesome the story is !!, 
  edit : i just found out about out of oz . 
  a thanks , yeah , it 's the `` go crazy '' that i did n't understand . 
  thanks , 
  muphry 's law , it 's `` replies '' , 
  yeah , singapore is a terrible place for anything artistic or innovative . 
  but it is a scam . 
  she 's claiming to be sending nude pictures of herself in exchange for money , when in fact they are pictures off of the internet . 
  that 's the scam . 
  still , i do n't know for sure , but i would guess impersonating an officer of the law would be a more serious offense ... 
  when our school put in wifi , a student flat out asked a teacher ( trust me , if you knew the guy , you 'd know he was n't even joking ) if they could watch porn with it . 
  tbh , the first three pictures are n't great , but the last one is ** awesome ** !!, 
  she looks really pretty . 
  dang , i was gon na say that - . -, 
  upvote for telling people what the deleted comment was . 
  yes !, 
  so much !, 
  i wish i could just listen to the video in the background while i quickly leave to look something up/check something . 
  or , when i 'm listening to music on youtube , just leave it running as i do other things . 
  in soviet russia , porn looks at you . 
  hope you do n't do any business with vietnam . 
  local currency is the dong . 
  i just kept it until i had a whole heap of lockpicks left over , then i went and completed the quest . 
  i have n't had to worry about running out since then , and the last stage of the quest was pretty fun . 
  console commands ? 
  i saw the button at the bottom `` report abuse '' and thought that it was very appropriate .

  glad someone 's mentioned them . 
  i 've not seen them live , but they truly are awesome to see on youtube . 
  downvote , because `` downvote '', 
  there should be a way of mentioning where you 're from . 
  the legal drinking age may not be till 21 in the usa , but for most of the world it 's 18 or younger . 
  also surprised no mention of tobacco products . 
  there are valid reasons , but i do n't think this is one .
