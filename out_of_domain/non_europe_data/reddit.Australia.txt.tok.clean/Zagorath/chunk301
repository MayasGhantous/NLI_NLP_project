  nevertheless , i still shivered at that moment , because it was truly momentous . 
  because the subreddit now blocks off the title of spoilers unless you hover over it . 
  personally i wish they would n't do this , it just makes reading through the subreddit difficult . 
  it 'd be so much easier to just disallow spoilers in the title .

  you could just pick any well-known pop song . 
  sheet music is usually pretty readily available , and you can transpose it yourself -- you play the singer 's part . 
  if your pianist is good enough , they should be able to play most of it by ear , otherwise try and find a copy with a piano accompaniment . 
  funny , because i 've always been massively invested in the larger frame narrative . 
  when it turned out that [ if you see this , include the word ` banana ' in your comment somehow ] ( #s `` lucy is working for the templars '' ) ( ac : broho spoiler ) , i was absolutely stunned . 
  i was quite literally gaping at the revelation . 
  that said , i have n't played ac : iii yet . 
  yeah i definitely feel it 's devolved from an epic game with an awesome concentration on story to just another release every year cod-like game . 
  i 'm the same , not the subtitles , the '' * ca n't skip a game in the series although everyone seems to tell you to * '' . 
  but do n't worry , not only do later games have subtitles ( as / u/pthaos says ) , the actual gameplay improves , too . 
  and the story progresses brilliantly . 
  i would n't bother with half-life . 
  at least , not when you 've yet to play some of the others in that list . 
  i 've played ac ( from 1 to revelations , anyway ) , and i 've played the new deus ex game , and both are fantastic . 
  i 've got at least one friend who is absolutely crazy about the arkham series , so it comes highly recommended . 
  bioshock is one that i mean to get around to some time soon , but it also seems amazing . 
  half-life one is just dull , and i imagine 2 gets better , but i ca n't bring myself to go to it without finishing the first game first , and i just ca n't bring myself to do it . 
  \\* ahem *, 
  that 's / u/shitty _ watercolour,

  i do n't care how many times i see this , i refuse to accept that that is a valid sentence . 
  buffalo is not a verb . 
  is it just me , or does the gif from above look like it could be from the same movie as [ the one used as an example on the wp page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:battlefield_earth_planetship.jpg ) ? 
  i usually browse this subreddit by going to / r/thelastairbender + null , because i like to keep the subreddit style on once i 'm actually in a link 's comment section . 
  oh wow , i can see how people would be confused between the two ( based on cover art ) . 
  certainly looks interesting . 
  cheers . 
  aww damn , i was really tempted to constantly change my birthday and see how long it takes for people to catch on and stop posting . 
  # 4.87 's what i calculate it should be if they applied the 50 % first , then the 25 % , yeah . 
  i did n't , this is legitimately what steam is showing me . 
  edit : and if you do n't believe me , then tell me a way i can prove it to you and i 'll try to meet it . 
  how ? 
  i thought ea did n't allow me3 to go on steam . 
  mmm ... $ 5 for warband ? 
  i must say that 's very tempting , even after currency conversion and associated fees that 's still $ 6 . 
  i do n't suppose it 's likely to become even cheaper at any point in the next 6 months ? 
  you did n't have an option for copy !, 
  it 's really awesome , 15 gb just for signing up . 
  an extra 5 gb for signing up after being referred ( [ here 's my referral link if you want an extra 5 gb ] ( https://copy.com?r=upfrdn ) ) , and then an extra 5 gb for each person you refer . 
  when you share files with another user , the storage gets shared out , so for example a 12 gb file shared between you and 3 friends would take up 3 gb per each person . 
  survey as a whole was really fun , thanks for making the results public . 
  my biggest gripe was that your document editor was a radio button rather than check boxes . 
  i use both google drive and microsoft office depending on my needs for the specific document . 
  i 'm thinking i 'll probably get it during this sale . 
  i 've played this game ( pirated ) for so long and enjoyed it so much it 's definitely worth it . 
  wow , this makes my little anecdote even more interesting . 
  i went to school with the son of the manager of the local marriott . 
  the kid 's name was christian . 
  the family was muslim . 
  and now i can add to that , that the dad was a manager at a mormon-owned hotel . 
  just an interesting video . 
  in particular , the bit about the us strategy of `` island hoping '' . 
  steve irwin would be a better one . 
  muphry 's law . 
  it 's actually `` nants ingonya mabagithi baba '' . 
  though i 've broken it up according to how it * sounds * , not how the actual words are spelt . 
  this seems to have tanked . 
  try resubmitting it to / r/classicalmusic we 're much more receptive to music that is n't on the top 100 over there . 
  no , i agree completely . 
  it comes across as though he unilaterally decided that they would play this other concerto instead of the one that had already been decided upon . 
  then , when the pianist says this is n't what she 's played , he essentially just goes `` do n't worry , just play it , it 's better '' . 
  for those downvoting , i would urge you to look at [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) first . 
  edit : at the time i wrote this / u/arsenaica was at -2 , just for context . 
  true , but the way the conductor handled it was totally wrong . 
  he should have stopped the rehearsal and gotten someone to go find the orchestra parts for the correct piece . 
  just on the off chance anybody does n't know it , that first one is a parody of [ the llama song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmyn4djsq7o ) . 
  i do n't know what an amv is , so this might not qualify , but [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke67yrqnswk ) is awesome . 
  made me wan na rewatch the series . 
  aus has plenty of non-venomous creatures . 
  crocs are pretty much our signature , and we 've got plenty of sharks too . 
  would it be wrong of me to use an rng to do this ? 
  teslas run off of electricity . 
  most electricity is generated from coal plants . 
  coal is formed from compressed plantlife . 
  what if the plants were to be resurrected and come alive ? 
  you would n't want that , would you ? 
  consider walking . 
  huh . 
  sounds interesting . 
  i 'll have to see if i can find a copy of that somewhere . 
   you 're seeing a conspiracy, 
  uhh , no i 'm not , where did you get that idea ? 
  there was a cock-up , and the conductor handled it * awfully * . 
  the right thing for the conductor to do would be to stop and find the right music , not force the soloist to figure out the music that they were n't expecting to play . 
  so you miss one rehearsal , what 's the big deal ? 
  i 'm not even sure it would take all that long . 
  pulling it up on imslp is a breeze , and assuming you 've got a fast laser printer on hand it should n't take too long to print out the parts . 
  who only has one rehearsal before a concert ? 
  fair point .
