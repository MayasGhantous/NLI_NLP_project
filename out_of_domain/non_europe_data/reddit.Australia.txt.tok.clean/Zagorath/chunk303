  ( sorry if that comes across as hostile towards you , it was n't meant it . ), 
  `` the term has been used in rural queensland , australia as a synonym for peanut butter . 
  this followed pressure from dairy farmers who did not want peanut butter competing with butter for market share . '', 
  from wikipedia . 
  the source seems to be out of date , though . 
  you can answer that yourself by looking at the photo . 
  assuming op did n't shift the exposure down massively in editing , the exposure looks just right to me , so yes , the high iso was necessary . 
  the other alternative would 've been an even slower shutter speed , which is obviously problematic . 
  edit : from the description on flickr `` straight from the camera '' , so this is the exposure without being edited , so the above applies . 
  op said above , 6400 iso , 9 seconds , f2 .8 . 
  only 9 seconds at f2 .8 , iso 6400 . 
  uhh , actually yes . 
  if we accept your premise that wages follow inflation ( whether or not anyone reading this agrees that is true is irrelevant , we need to take this as a premise ) , then in nominal terms , wages go up . 
  the price of games has stayed the same , in nominal terms . 
  that means that in real terms ( i.e. , adjusted for inflation ) , the games have gotten cheaper . 
  hahaha , very clever . 
  well yeah , but the implication of saying something follows inflation is that it matches the cpi . 
  which i was n't disagreeing with out agreeing with . 
  my point was simply that given the premise , the conclusion that should be drawn was the opposite of what the person i replied to was drawing . 
  a logical argument , not an economic one . 
  a ) what 's your basis for saying that, 
  b ) what 's your point ? 
  on my phone it looks kinda like a thumbs up . 
  edit : actually , it still looks like that to me now i 'm on my computer ... 
  not a lawyer here , and only basing this on what i read in this exact thread , but i would guess it 's a legal defense for anything that `` temporary insanity '' can be a legal defense for . 
  ( someone with more knowledge , please correct me if i 'm wrong , i 'd like to know . ), 
   the first one was born with her umbilical cord around her neck and nearly strangled herself, 
  are you from butterfly effect ? 
  they let you vote on it ? 
  huh ? 
  ouch , you just barely missed out on the sale . 
  seriously congrats on getting into it , it really is an awesome game !, 
  i just finally ponied up and bought it after having played it pirated for a long time . 
  because it 's totally worth it . 
  which game ( s ) are you playing ? 
  there 're a few in the series , the most popular of which is warband , but there 's also warband : napoleonic wars ( technically an expansion , but practically a separate game ) and with fire & sword , not to mention the original mount & blade game . 
  also , multiplayer or singleplayer ? 
  the two experiences are completely different . 
  personally i do n't even see why you would want to play multiplayer , because the campaign is the best part of it imo , with the awesome battle mechanics just adding the spice to the game . 
  ah , right . 
  i was in saigon . 
  i thank god , i thought i was the only one here who does n't read the comics . 
  i remember when jagex promised us runescape 3 would n't come out until we had tubes going into our heads with which to play the game . 
  i wish we did have that now :(, 
  the scanner app ? 
  i just take a photo of it . 
  even have the camera app set so i can swipe to the side from my lock screen , do n't need to unlock it to take the photo . 
  i 'm really , * really * hoping that sqrl manages to take off . 
  i 'm not enough into security to really understand how it works , but all i know is if steve gibson not only trusts it , but * invented * it , then i trust it , and god damn it could be useful . 
  in every thread some great usernames . 
  the korean war was exacerbated by us intervention ? 
  i 'm not sure you understand that war very well . 
  first of all , it was n't the us . 
  the korean war is the * only * war to have * ever * been fought by the united nations . 
  it was lead by the us , but it was internationally agreed that intervention was necessary . 
  second , look at the state of north korea today . 
  then look at south korea . 
  sure it 's difficult to say that if the north had won the war , the entire peninsula would be exactly like the north is today , but it certainly is n't a stretch to say it would n't be as powerful as the south is . 
  un intervention in that war is perhaps the * best * example of foreign intervention in a domestic conflict causing positive results . 
  i 'm not sure `` dufflebag '' is a word everyone will know , you should clarify . 
  i 'm ** certain ** metrocard is n't a word everyone will know . 
  i googled it , and it seems to be the * brand name * of a number of different payment systems in different cities . 
  here in brisbane ( and south-east queensland ) we have gocards , which i believe are the same thing . 
  hong kong uses their octopus cards , which i believe do public transport as well as a few other things . 
  london has oyster cards , and i think singapore has ez-link . 
  point being , metrocard is just one of many brand names people might not be familiar with . 
  otherwise , it was good . 
  ooo thanks !, 
  not quite as useful as actually having the videos ( do n't know when they pop up , for example ) but infinitely better than having nothing !, 
  brisbaner here , do n't worry , we feel the same way as you do about fnq . 
  ( also western queensland , too . ), 
  i was actually more impressed that he mentioned dvo\u0159\u00e1k and tchaikovsky . 
  two absolutely brilliant composers , and also not the ones that someone without some background in classical music are likely to bring up . 
  a rare moment of class from mr pyne . 
  in general , i suspect that may be true , but in the case of star wars i highly doubt it . 
  can i just point out that the logicalincrements builds seem to be a lot more expensive than what pcpartpicker is showing me . 
  have a look at [ this build ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/1sytk ) that i just threw together . 
  i have no idea how good it is in terms of balance of spending on different parts etc. , which is what logicalincrements is meant to be about , but you 're getting a lot more in nearly every spec area . 
  the build i threw together shows $ 1150 ( my location set to aus , i think -- their site makes it difficult to tell ) for :, 
  * 2 tb hdd, 
  * 128 gb ssd, 
  * amd fx-8320 3.5 ghz 8-core processor ( which , from what i can tell , is comparable to a lower end i7, 
  * nvidia gtx 660, 
  of those , only the graphics card is significantly below the one offered at the `` excellent '' rating on logicalincrements , which is priced at $ 1304 according to their website . 
  the fact that this one is so much better than what logicalincrements has to offer and is a fair bit cheaper , you could actually go for the same graphics card and still be better off in terms of storage and processing power . 
  point being , maybe shop around a bit more than logicalincrements , you may be able to go quite a bit further with your money than it would suggest . 
  ( in particular , stores like msy -- despite their ** awful ** website , are generally considered pretty good deals for aussie gamers and pc builders . ), 
  except that there are other definitions . 
   an activity that one engages in for amusement, 
  seems to for nicely . 
  i 'm not sure it 's a ponzi scheme so much as just a bubble . 
  the term ponzi scheme , to me at least , implies some malicious intent . 
  what you have here is simply the market overvaluing something and getting more and more investment in it . 
  you mean corn maizes , [ surely ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/sting.ogg ) ? 
  anzac day ? 
  there 's also that one reddit loves to orgasm over . 
  what 's it 's name ? 
  half something ? 
  do n't forget tone !, 
  in case that was a serious question , no , it is n't .
