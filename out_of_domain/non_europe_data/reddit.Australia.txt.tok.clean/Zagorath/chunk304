  it * is * a part of the british isles ( although many irish people would refuse to accept that ) , but it is n't a part of britain . 
  heck , it is n't even a part of the united kingdom , which includes great britain and northern ireland . 
  britain is the name of the island which includes england , scotland , and wales . 
  the uk is the country which includes the above , as well as northern ireland . 
  the republic of ireland ( which is what is meant when people merely say `` ireland '' ) is an entirely separate country which just happens to be close geographically .

  it 's not that bad . 
  i cycled from st lucia to stafford and back on election day , and more recently from st lucia all the way to bracken ridge and then back the following day . 
  the time taken was quite reasonable given the distance . 
  there 's no way i 'd cycle that far on a regular basis as part of a commute , but that 's just because of the sheer distance , not the cycling infrastructure . 
  i do n't recall naruto ever being mentioned in the director commentary , although i just found out about `` avatar extras '' , which was text pop ups over the episodes . 
  in the avatar extras , naruto is mentioned exactly once , in the episode `` jet '' . 
   [ the anime series ` naruto ' and ` samurai champloo ' inspired these fight scenes ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/avatar_extras_ ( book_one : _ water \\ ) ) . 
  based on that , i do n't think it 's possible to make any larger connections to that show . 
  roku does indeed lava bend , but if you think about it that 's pretty logical . 
  within the avatar universe it 's easy to understand lava as being fire and earth , and so if you can bend both , you can bend lava . 
  woodbending does n't really happen , but i do n't think earthbending would be involved in any way . 
  they already have plantbending done by bending the water in the plant , and i think claiming that the solid parts of the plants are ` earth ' is an extremely forced connection to make . 
  how does that help ? 
  expanding an image with res decreases the quality the same way zooming in on a webpage does . 
  you clearly do n't know what the word ` spoiler ' means . 
  he * is * a piece of shit . 
  i do n't know about his music , so i wo n't comment -- it could be incredible , or it could be incredibly bland , most likely somewhere in between -- but as a human being he is quite objectively a piece of shit . 
  so you concede that f2p games * can * be done well , and have been done well by valve ? 
  would you not , therefore , agree with people here who are saying that f2p is n't the problem , but developers ' implementations of f2p are ? 
  ( by the way , this conversation might work better in the format of / r/changemyview ), 
  yeah , i 've heard contacts can be bad for people with astigmatism . 
  which is a nuisance , because i have that too . 
  lpt : buy earphones with [ flat cables ] ( http://blog.itechtalk.com/wp-content/2010/10/1.120.png ) they simply * do not tangle * . 
  your method looks like it, 
  a ) takes a long time to do, 
  b ) involves deliberately tangling them so that they are easier to untangle , but still not as simple as grabbing them from your pocket and a quick shake, 
  but nutrients from the earth \u2260 the earth . 
  no amount of actual * dirt * goes into a plant , so it makes no sense to say that you could bend a plant using earthbending . 
  the thing about quadrant 2 vs 1 is that ideally you should catch things in quadrant 2 * before * they move to quadrant 1 . 
  quadrant 1 is that 20 % report that 's due tomorrow . 
  quadrant 2 is that same report , but two weeks before the deadline . 
  you should do it before it gets to the last minute . 
  however , if you 've got two 20 % reports due , one tomorrow , and one in two weeks , which should you do ? 
  obviously the one due tomorrow . 
  if you have something in quadrant 1 , then it needs to be prioritised over quadrant 2 , however you should ideally avoid getting too many things in quadrant 1 to begin with . 
  i 'm gon na join the party saying that we 'd be really grateful if you shared this !, 
  which way ? 
  expanding in res or by zooming in on the web page ? 
  because either way is just fine , and so saying that someones should install res does n't really make sense . 
  the age of empires series is easily the top of the genre . 
  in particular , ** age of empires ii : age of kings ** is often heralded as the best , although i prefer the spinoff , ** age of mythology ** . 
  there 's a new game currently in beta called ** [ planetary annihilation ] ( http://www.uberent.com/pa/ ) ** , which made a massive $ 2 million on kickstarter , reaching every single one of their stretch goals . 
  it 's going to be an rts game where you can travel between different planets and stuff , and it looks awesome . 
  they also are attempting to minimise `` micro '' , which is something that can make rts games really irritating to play , where you 're forced to micromanage the movements of every individual unit in order to win . 
  it 's being developed by many of the same people as total annihilation , which i believe is a really popular game . 
   my jokingly condescending semantics, 
  i do n't think you know what the word `` semantics '' means , and i think most people would agree that your previous comment did n't come across as `` jokingly condescending '' so much as `` dickishly condescending '' . 
  can you not just accept that some people do n't like the music you like ? 
  sch\u00f6nberg writes music that most people do not find very tasteful or interesting to listen to , and there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  [ planetary annihilation ] ( http://www.uberent.com/pa/ ) is in beta at the moment and coming out soon . 
  it looks incredible , though i have n't got it yet . 
  the developers have been quite actively engaging with their community , too . 
  made by many of the same people that did total annihilation , and they 're trying to avoid an emphasis on micro that is the biggest problem with other well-known rts games . 
  aoe iii is also an awesome game , and the aoe series is famous for some of the best singleplayer experience of any rts game . 
  unlike many games , in aoe the bots are forced to follow the same rules as the player , and changing difficulty just changes how smart they play . 
  some other games implement cheats such as decreasing or increasing the rate at which they gather resources . 
  not as good as aom , in my opinion , but unfortunately they never released the expansion pack for aom on mac . 
  here they 're usually not free , but occasionally someone will host one to advertise something so they give them away for free with a flyer for their event . 
  not much beautiful nature in the vatican . 
  edit : according to [ this guy ] ( http://www.360nobs.com/2013/02/worwor-country-man-who-has-visited-139-countries-says-nigeria-has-been-my-least-beautiful-destination/ ) , nigeria is n't very beautiful , either . 
  do n't ask me what 's up with that website , it 's fucked . 
  the way it 's celebrated in european soccer leagues is just way over the top to the point of absurdity . 
  awesome !, 
  what you studying ? 
  this is n't a permanent thing , it 's a rule in place for the duration of a major international summit . 
  yeah , this makes it sound like outside of the duration of the summit , this is a totally legal thing to do . 
   semantics : the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning, 
  nowhere in your previous comment did you challenge the meaning of any of the words or phrases used by the person you replied to . 
  perhaps you meant it jokingly , but that is not how it came across in the least . 
  it came across as though you were saying `` you are close minded for not liking this music '' , which is condescending and -- without further context -- not humourous . 
  i agree that not allowing large banners seems excessive , but 1m by 2m is pretty large . 
  i imagine they 're worried about them being used as shields or something . 
  from the article they linked within this article :, 
   convicted criminals living within restricted zones for next year 's g20 summit in brisbane could get a short holiday at taxpayers ' expense . 
  quick , you 've got about a year to commit a crime , get convicted , and move into the city . 
  [ the / r/australia comment thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1piju1/17_objects_banned_from_brisbanes_g20_summit/ ), 
  a normal flimsy wooden one perhaps , but there 's no way they could know that it is n't reinforced for exactly that purpose . 
  even so , that is probably the worst one of the rules in the list . 
  along with flotation devices and eggs . 
  you asked for a country without beautiful nature , i provided one . 
  and yeah , i 've never been to nigeria so i really ca n't comment , just some random guy claimed it 's not very good . 
  regarding nigeria , my results from google show some moderately nice looking waterfalls and a rock , neither of which i would call particularly beautiful . 
  certainly not comparable to the great barrier reef , the blue mountains , or uluru -- the latter of which is beautiful not in and of itself , so much as the way it plays with the harsh desert sun and the land around it . 
  yeah that one ( as well as a few others ... no eggs ? 
  wtf ? ), 
  was a bit over the top , but no bows and arrows , handcuffs , or blowpipes make a lot of sense . 
   there are so many countries with very nice nature that i do n't see it as a redeeming trait, 
  very true . 
  the only thing i was doing -- and i really was n't trying to point out that anything more than this one very narrow thing is true -- was pointing out that not * every * country does indeed have lovely nature . 
  i would agree with you that the ** vast ** majority do , in fact . 
   if ricky gervais had said my not-so-jokingly condescending line to you with a sarcastic smile , you 'd have absolutely no problem, 
  i have to be honest , i ** love ** gervais 's style of humour , but i 'm failing to see how the comment you made could have been done in a humourous way . 
  even going back and reading over it again with context , it just seems arrogant .
