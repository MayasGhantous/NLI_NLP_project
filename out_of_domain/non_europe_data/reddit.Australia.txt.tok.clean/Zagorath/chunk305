  usually in these situations one can go back , reread it , and understand how it was misinterpreted , but i 'm not seeing that here . 
  i 'm going to guess from your username , and from a couple of small grammatical mistakes , that english is n't your native language . 
  perhaps the joke would have worked better in your language ? 
  ( forgive me if i 'm wrong about that point , it * is n't * the core of my argument and i 'd rather not get caught up on it . ), 
  i 'm going to make mine 999 by 1999 mm , just so that mine can be seen more easily than yours . 
  [ did n't take me long ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dba-02-mkii-dual-balanced-earphones-juggernaut/dp/b00c1dulje/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1383109778&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flat+cable+earbuds ) . 
  i personally am not an audiophile , though , and for earphones i do n't understand how anyone can be : you 're listening in an environment that 's far from controlled , if you were in a more controlled environment some proper audiophile headphones would be much better . 
  still , if you are an audiophile , and for whatever reason you feel the need to have audiophile quality earphones when on the go , perhaps this little tip is n't for you . 
  it does n't mean it does n't apply to most people , and that 's fine . 
  no tip works for * everyone * . 
  flat cable earphones are incredibly useful for those that choose to use them . 
  oh how devious !, 
  i wish you did n't assume that just because you were downvoted , it must have been by me . 
  it was n't , i hold rediquette far too highly for that . 
  indeed , the only one of your comments that i downvoted was the one that is being discussed . 
  i simply had n't seen your reply yet , due to not having refreshed any reddit page for the past hour . 
  i 'll get to reading and responding to your latest reply in just a bit . 
  yeah you 'd think . 
   it 's really similar to recursive proofs , and i figure you do n't have a problem with that, 
  perhaps i 'm not correctly interpreting what you mean , but surely recursive proofs are * by definition * incorrect ? 
  my biggest reason for not liking proof by induction at first was that it felt to me exactly like it was a recursive proof . 
  you assume the conclusion is true in order to prove that the premise is true . 
  it took me a while to realise that the way it really works : prove that, 
  ** if ** the statement works for n = k ,, 
  ** then ** it must work for n = k +1 ,, 
  and ** since ** you 've proven it for some value ( usually n = 1 ) , it must work for every n \u2265 1 . 
  and so it makes a lot of sense . 
  hi whoever 's following this . 
  please do n't go downvoting because you disagree , remember rediquette . 
  hmm , upon re-rereading it , the `` how does you '' , which i initially took to be bad grammar , may actually have been deliberately bad grammar in order to convey the comical effect you were going for . 
  is that it ? 
   i think the ` yeah funny but ' is what 's throwing it off, 
  actually , yeah , i think you might be right . 
  when i reread * ignoring that bit * , it comes across a lot less arrogant . 
   without the ` yeah funny but ' its quite obviously either a joke or very conceited, 
  most definitely . 
  i still do n't think it comes across as a particularly effective * joke * , but it 's at least clear that it can be interpreted as not being serious . 
  ps , you 're now res stored as zero votes , since i figured this comment was good enough that even though i disagree i 've upvoted it , 
  many touristy places do , in fact , accept american dollars . 
  it 's not hard at all to find places in saigon where they 'll accept us dollars , though not everywhere does . 
  say ... -180 cm , give or take . 
   now you must be calling us deutschland, 
  i would be ok with this . 
  i 've always been a bit uneasy about the fact that countries are n't called by the names that they use for themselves , or at least an approximation thereof for when languages do n't accommodate it very well . 
  for example , in korean , germany/deutsland would be \ub354\uc774\uce20\ub79c\ub4dc , or something like that . 
  my assumption was that they * were n't thinking that so much as `` well they were allies in wwii , so surely they must 've been close together ? '', 
  edit : added `` were n't '', 
  yeah exactly . 
  i 've only ever used metric , but if you gave me a ruler with inches on it i could tell you how many inches a sheet of paper is . 
  heck , you could make up a new unit and call it flergleshmerfs , and i could tell you exactly how many flergleshmerfs my paper is , just be holding the ruler up to it and counting . 
  0 and infinite simultaneously , until you observe it . 
  this is off topic , but based on this conversation i get the feeling you might enjoy / r/changemyview . 
  there 's a vancouver in western australia ? 
  could n't you just say `` washington state '' ? 
  or are people really so dumb that they 'd ask if you 're from dc even if you did that ? 
  i 'm not american , and if you just said `` washington '' , i 'd assume you meant dc , but if you said washington state i 'd god damn know what you 're talking about . 
  heck , i could even ( roughly ) locate it on a map , which is more than i could say for most us states . 
  if you 're australian and you do n't know that canberra is the capital of australia , you 're just as stupid . 
  if you 're not australian , you 're totally excused , unless you are actually * in * australia at the time . 
  capitol is the name of the building , capital refers to the most important political city in a country or state . 
  to be fair , us states have the most random-arse capitals . 
  how the fuck can you have a state named new york , with the country 's largest city ( both economically and by population ) , also named new york , in that state , and * not * have new york city be the capital of new york state ? 
  it makes * no * sense . 
  i love the music reference , but does it actually make logical sense ? 
  my understanding ( and certainly the way i 've always used it in discussion/assignments/exams ) is that metre is ( almost ) the same thing as time signature . 
  so `` how many seconds are in a metre '' does n't really make sense as a question . 
  `` how many seconds are in a * bar * ? '', 
  would make sense , and the metre does tell you ( again , kind of ) how many beats are in a bar , but you ca n't get a number of seconds per metre from that . 
  / music theory nerd-out, 
  as others have said , yup , it 's exactly the same thing . 
  what 's really fun , though , is that the same word can have a different gender in different languages . 
  this can even completely change the way people think about objects . 
  example : [ bridge is masculine in spanish , and feminine in german . 
  but spanish people instinctively assign masculine qualities to bridges , and germans assign feminine ones . 
  for example , show a german speaker a picture of a bridge and they 're more likely to describe it as `` elegant '' or `` slender . '', 
  the spanish lean more toward `` strong '' .

  i sometimes write =  when i take the derivative of something . 
  i 'm thinking in my head `` it * goes to * this '' . 
  writing d ( function ) / dx is such a pain . 
  do they ? 
  at my uni the first maths course for engineers ( and people studying maths , i believe ) -- assuming you took advanced maths in high school -- is called `` calculus & linear algebra i '' , which is then followed up by `` multivariate calculus & ordinary differential equations '' . 
  i read that there 's a place in the states called notre dame , but it 's pronounced notter day-m ? 
  ( serious question , i vaguely remember reading that somewhere recently . ), 
  right now i 'd almost take him over abbott . 
  detroit 's another one that i 've never been able to get my head around ... 
  actually yeah that 's true , was really annoying . 
  i 've started wearing my cable * inside * my shirt ( which is something i used to do fairly often anyway ) and that completely solves it . 
  ah ok , i was thinking of recursive as meaning circular . 
  my initial impression of proof by induction was that it seemed circular . 
  ( side note , i ca n't do recursive programming to save my life . 
  i mean , i wrote the required recursive scripts when it was necessary in my introductory course , but that was in no small part through trial and error . ), 
  question , if it had a 36-bit word length , would you not have to define a byte as some factor of 36 ? 
  unfortunately that 's probably not the same thing ( as discussed by other replies to / u/yamhadan 's comment ) . 
  my windows pc 's in being repaired at the moment , but on my mac there 's a setting under `` sound '' on the `` output '' tab with a slider for balance . 
  i 'd be surprised if windows did n't have something similar * somewhere * , or at least an easy way to do the same thing with a 3rd party programme . 
  yeah , we were taught that we have to write a 3 line concluding statement at the end , and we basically just rote memorised it . 
  now that i know how it actually works i know what to write because i know what i 'm actually doing with it . . 
  this is quite specifically about brisbane and relevant knowledge for brisbanites , i 'd say it belongs here even more than it does in / r/australia . 
  it 's actually a feature that * primarily exists * for people deaf in one ear .
