  that said , if i did go , i 'd probably follow your advice regarding good service . 
  but bad service , hell no . 
  if i get bad service , fuck that , i 'm not paying shit . 
  it says here on the bill this is how much my meal costs , so i 'm paying that . 
  at least then i 'd have plausible deniability as a foreigner . 
  it would probably be * worse * if i gave a small tip , that says `` i know i 'm supposed to tip , but i do n't want to , so here 's bugger all '' . 
  i should note , though , that i 'm talking complete hypotheticals here . 
  i ca n't ever think of an example in my life where i 've had what i would consider * bad * service , so perhaps i 'm just easy going with that kind of thing , which would mean that the ` bad service ' i 'm talking about is unlikely to come up anyway . 
  try to write get sticky , and your y key ... gets sticky ? 
  and ah , right , now i get it . 
   well , with tipping , servers are encouraged to be nice and do a good job , because they get paid better for it, 
  people keep bringing this up , but every person in this thread who 's actually experienced it seems to say otherwise . 
  service in other countries is great even without the incentive . 
  the argument * does n't work * . 
  to be fair , our states are also geographically * much * larger than yours on average . 
  from memory , i think our top three are all larger than your number 1 ( of the contiguous states , because alaska throws things off too much ) . 
  edit : actually , our largest two are larger even than alaska , and our largest 5 ( including the northern territory ) are larger than your next biggest , texas . 
  which is odd , because i 've always considered new south wales quite small , and texas quite large , but nsw is actually over 100,000 km ^ 2 larger . 
  now i forgot how this thread started . 
  ah well , good talk . 
  how many places outside of the states have you dined out at ? 
  i have n't been to the us to make the comparison , but i have always had * very * pleasant experiences in all the countries i 've been to , including australia . 
  i ca n't understand how it could be `` more pleasant '' without the staff coming across as creepy . 
  all of them . 
  i 've been to all the countries . 
  edit : just tried a serious count , probably missed a couple , but i count 24 . 
  i lived in a third world country for a long time , and rarely tipped more than `` keep the change '' for taxis , and usually nothing at all at restaurants with friends . 
  i think my parents would usually tip about 100,000 dong ( approximately 5 usd ) depending on the restaurant . 
  nothing similar to the rampant tipping culture of the us . 
  as an australian , albeit one who has not spent much time living here , / u/spudofdoom more or less summed up my understanding of tips in aus . 
  i can list 'em if you like ( wrote 'em in a text file to make counting easier ) . 
  i 'm what could be described as a third culture kid . 
  lived in three countries , and i 've been travelling since i was 10 ( which for a 3ck is actually a rather late start ) . 
  i should note for clarity that those `` 24 '' included vatican city , which is universally recognised as a country , although for practical purposes that is a tentative title , and taiwan , which is almost universally * not * recognised as a country ( aside from , coincidentally , the vatican ) , but for practical purposes is one . 
  i do n't think any of the others are ambiguous , apart from one that i literally drove through and never really `` visited '' in any real way , aside from a couple of nice photos . 
  comparing it as in looking on a map of australia . 
  it just seems small when you 're comparing it to wa and qld . 
   basically limited to instruments that are found in orchestras, 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxxslho4a5a ) there were two chopin , one purely for piano , and one concerto . 
  mussorgsky 's pictures were * technically * written for piano , and the liszt piece is piano solo . 
  not to mention that while the other non-orchestral works do use `` instruments that are found in orchestras '' , there are two chamber pieces ( violin solo and a cello sonata ) , as well as the pieces for voice and orchestra . 
  not really sure what more you would want . 
  that 's pretty much covered all bases for mainstream western classical music . 
  but there even was some voice . 
  yeah it 's not actual safety i 'm worried about , it 's having to take off shoes and get felt up at airports . 
  i know for a fact there are exactly 50 , and because that 's such a large number i ca n't be arsed to actually name them all , but i would guess i could probably name about half . 
  pretty sure it 's the capital of florida . 
  * shhh !!!, 
  * do n't remind them !, 
  australia , like the us ( i believe ) is a federation , where states are a recognised part of the constitution of the country and have significant political power . 
  in australia , over time , the power of states has become significantly less ( thankfully ) , while that has not happened quite so much in the us . 
  this lessening in power may be part of the reason you have n't heard of them , although that 's more likely attributed to a general lack of exposure to australian politics compared to the us ( which is pretty impossible to escape if you do n't live under a rock ) . 
  missed , or chose to ignore ? 
  the only reason i know about them is some random article i saw ( probably from reddit ) about the countries with the least free media in the world . 
  i was surprised to see eritrea was worse than even north korea . 
  the correct terms for the `` important ones '' is internal territories , although it is generally accepted that `` territories '' refers to these , and that the term `` external territories '' is to be used for any other places . 
  jervis bay being the exception , as it is an internal territory , though when people say `` territory '' they usually are n't thinking of it . 
  heck , that 's a damn fine job there . 
  what 's your country ? 
  i highly doubt i 'll be able to name any of the regions . 
  i was hoping you 'd say france or germany , because i could probably have named one or two there . 
  i have n't the slightest clue , i 'm afraid . 
  edit : just looked it up . 
  i absolutely love that there 's a region called `` finland proper '' . 
  brilliant name . 
  is the vatican ? 
  ouch . 
  where 'd you go to school ? 
  so , like the united mexican states ? 
  tritone , actually . 
  [ cgpgrey recently described it as the anti-hong kong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aiveqmfppk ) . 
  ( or , to be specific , he described the reverse . ), 
  vatican city : the least country-like country that 's still a country . 
  hong kong : the most country-like country that is n't . 
  this ** so ** much . 
  there is exactly ** zero ** indication that op is doing anything remotely resembling what everyone is criticising him for , so people need to stop being a dick and telling him how to live his life and how to raise his kids . 
  no it most certainly is not a primary key . 
  in almost any system , many different entries will have the same year , meaning year ( by itself ) can not be a primary key . 
   really fucking hot, 
  30 \u02da is a pretty hot day , but i would n't start calling it `` really fucking hot '' until you hit mid 30s or 40 \u02da . 
   even in solidly si countries like the uk, 
  hi there , the uk is not a solidly si country . 
  sincerely , australia . 
  three feet in a yard ? 
  1760 yards in a mile ? 
  12 inches in a foot ? 
  i do n't know what system you 're using , but the imperial system that i 've heard of does n't use base 2 . 
  the difference is that there 's massive culture and literature surrounded in language that does n't translate well to other languages . 
  there 's no such thing as that with units of measurement . 
  at worst , you just need to keep a record of what the values are so that if you come across historical documents you know what they mean . 
  what happens if someone has a carbon fibre frame ? 
  sucks for them , i guess . 
   just similar colors look the same, 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i thought most forms of colourblindness involve not being able to distinguish between significantly different colours , like red and green . 
  the best way to use scientific notation is with a capital e , i feel . 
  9e6 is much easier to type out than either of the above . 
  my answer was `` it 's 3am , so i 'm obviously still awake , so i ca n't open my eyes . 
  i notice it 's my parents by looking out the window , so i definitely do n't want to open my door . 
  i go and open the jam for some toast . '',
