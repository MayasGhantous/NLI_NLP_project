  damn , now i just got ta figure out how to get 4 metre long paper ... 
  the start of the promise is really awful , but stick it out , it definitely gets better , presumably because the writers got used to the characters . 
  since when did we use the word fall for autumn ? 
  his `` ps '' bit is completely correct , christmas is just the christian appropriation of previous pagan rituals relating to the winter solstice . 
  adopting their holiday like this made it more palatable to convert . 
  the actual historical figure of jesus ( as opposed to the mythological figure based upon him ) was most likely born around july . 
  a ship load of it . 
  til jesus was born in darwin . 
  in all seriousness , i 'm pretty sure doing this at the federal level would be a constitutional change , and require a referendum . 
  is there not some equivalent at the state level ? 
  what are some examples of ideas you 've heard that are physically impossible ? 
  i 'm curious to see how these people think . 
  still got , and still happy with , my nexus 4 , but damn that looks good !, 
  the camera on my phone is absolutely crap , and the fact that there was n't a 32 gb option was a massive pain ( especially since there was no sd card option , though that does n't appear to have changed ) . 
  hope you enjoy it when it arrives !, 
  i believe the pirate party of australia has a really good solution to software patents . 
  * they should occur a higher fee to implement , to offset the extra cost of reviewing them ( explained below ), 
  * patents that are obvious to someone experienced in the field , are not novel , or have prior art , should be blocked . 
  * they should last only 5 years, 
  * ** functional claiming should be disallowed . 
  ** this is the most important bit , in my opinion . 
  require software patents to be on a specific * implementation * of an idea , and not the idea or the outcome itself . 
  * software patents must contain sufficient information that someone experienced in software development could implement the invention . 
  [ source ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/patents#software_patents ), 
  i see no reason that software patents need to be abolished entirely . 
  as far as i can see , this would solve all the big issues with them , at least when taken in the context of the pirate party 's general patent policies . 
  * ** must demonstrate active use of a patent in order to litigate on it **, 
  * protection for non-commercial use, 
  * protection in the case that an accused infringer can demonstrate that they developed the solution independently and without knowledge of the patent, 
  tpp actually [ does propose abolishing drug patents ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/patents#pharmaceutical_patents ) , replacing them with a bounty for creating `` drugs that serve an identified public good '' . 
  removing ip entirely ? 
  that 's just a ridiculous notion . 
  trademarks are absolutely necessary to stop people creating a competing product and selling it based purely on the brand , not only tricking consumers into buying lower quality products , but potentially tarnishing the reputation of the company whose brand has been co-opted . 
  copyrights are absolutely critical to enabling artists and content creators to make money off of their work . 
  small time musicians need copyright to prevent people simply taking their music and using it . 
  without copyright it 's basically impossible to make any money as an artist . 
  the current system is flawed , definitely , but copyright in * some * form is absolutely crucial . 
  it wo n't help in this case , but if you 're a mac gamer , you might like / r/macgaming, 
  yeah that entire movement , which seems quite popular on reddit , is absolutely ridiculous . 
  making trouble with the police just for the sake of ` exercising your rights ' . 
  no , you are n't standing up for your rights , you 're just being a complete dick for no reason . 
  i think the word you 're looking for there is ` entwined ' . 
  copyright benefits society in a very real way . 
  imagine , if you will , there was * no * copyright law . 
  that means it would be completely legal to pirate music , movies , and programmes . 
  it 's perhaps easiest to demonstrate the problem here with that last one . 
  currently , huge numbers of people will pirate software because it 's so easy . 
  businesses , of course , ca n't do this , because they need to operate in a way that wo n't get caught in an audit . 
  if copyright did n't exist there would be no logical reason for a company to pay for * any * software that they use . 
  adobe , microsoft , and other companies that make the majority of their money from selling software , would cease to exist . 
  not all musicians work through a large corporation , by the way . 
  many small time ones make money through licensing agreements to small-to-medium -- scale filmmakers , for example . 
  without copyright , filmmakers could just grab whatever music they want ( be it from small-scale creators or the top 100 ) and use it . 
  that small-scale musician is now out of business . 
  the problem with removing copyright does n't come from interactions between random individuals and content producers , it comes from the relation between entities which are structurally required to operate in accordance with the law and content creators . 
  hmm yeah , i really like the sound of that idea . 
  not sure if he also said it in a crashcourse video , but i just today came across [ this vlogbrothers video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3_ltur0lo ) in which he says `` here 's a little rule of thumb : aristotle , while he is very famous and everything , is * almost always wrong * '' . 
  i 'm not entirely sure , but i think that the pseudocode , the exact description of how something gets done , would be covered by a patent , while the idea of `` a button that allows you to purchase something with one click '' -- which is currently a real patent -- would be disallowed . 
  actual html/javascript/code would be copyright .

  because i paid her for sex . 
  no , but he 's 6.48155858 \u00d7 10 ^ -17 parsecs . 
  the person i was replying to really * was * arguing for a total abolition of all ip law . 
  i agree completely with you that copyright as it stands is way over-reaching its mark , and there is serious need for reform . 
  that kind of the reason i support the pirate party . 
  i do , however , reject the notion of the person i replied to that * no * copyright would be the ideal solution . 
  creators need some level of protection for their own work . 
  the problems come from larger third party corporations getting involved in it . 
  dunno about the us , but $ 100 notes here in aus are n't very common at all . 
  read the source , it clearly states `` patents for inventions primarily embodied in software '' . 
  and in theory that 's how it should be , but in practice many patents have very broad applications , which is the problem with the patent system as it stands . 
  you do realise that this is a policies page , not an actual bill before parliament ? 
  it would be a relatively simple process to nail down the specifics if you were intending to put it before parliament . 
  as it stands , the pirate party does n't have any members of parliament in either the reps or the senate , and so they have n't gone into the more nitpicky areas . 
  in general , it 's just about showing an actual use of the patent , which does n't necessarily need to be too specific : judges can decide on a case-by-case basis whether a patent was actually being used or whether its use is only being feigned for the purpose of litigating . 
  yep , australia . 
  [ here ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/copyright ) is tpp australia 's policy document on copyright . 
  it 's largely focused on increasing exemptions , such as requiring publicly funded research and public documents to be publicly available , and creating a proper ` fair use ' law , which we currently lack . 
  i do n't know the specifics of it -- i 'm not actually a member of the party -- but i do know that their method involved allowing any member of the party to have some say in it . 
  becoming a member is as simple as not being a member of another party , filling out an online form , and paying a small fee ( i think it was under $ 10 ) . 
  it 's important to note that this is a policy document , not necessarily a `` what we should change '' document . 
  they 're outlining everything about how the patent system in australia should work . 
  emphasising things that are currently technically in the law but do n't actually get implemented , like requiring ideas be novel and not be subject to prior art , needs to be done , since even if it is currently in the law , it is n't currently * happening * . 
  same with ideas . 
  currently , patents in software ( as well as in some other areas ) are being allowed which are overly broad . 
  for example `` system for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence '' . 
  in other words , a patent on podcasting . 
   a large corporation would be incentivized to simply wait out the 5 years instead of paying me any money . 
  as a large corporation , even as a late-comer they can easily muscle out the early adopters . 
  20 years , on the other hand , would really be too long to wait . 
  in contrast , as a small-time inventor , the revenue i could generate from a 5-year monopoly would be minimal, 
  the entire point here is that the technology industry moves * extremely * quickly . 
  5 years is not an amount of time you can simply `` wait out '' . 
  in five years there 's a good chance the patent wo n't be * worth * anything anyway , because the technology it covers may already be out of date . 
   you could say the same thing for any patent ( not just software ) ,, 
  did you actually read the linked policy document ? 
  heck , even my comment makes it pretty clear that the last three bullet points * do * apply to all patents . 
  the point is you have to be able to prove without a doubt that you were able to develop the technology completely independently . 
  if you 're saying `` that 's obvious , now that i know how you did it '' then you 're obviously not fulfilling that requirement .
