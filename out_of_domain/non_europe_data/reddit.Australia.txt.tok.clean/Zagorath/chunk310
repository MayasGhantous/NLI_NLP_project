  you 'd presumably need things like documents demonstrating that you were working on it prior to your competitor 's release/patenting of the technology . 
   protection for other uses opens up an enormous loophole , where ( for example ) `` free '' software could implement patented algorithms , and be conveniently bundled with a commercial front-end which `` just happens '' to be the only practical way to use the `` free '' software, 
  same deal as above , it 's quite clearly explained in the document :, 
   in the event that non-commercially developed products are subsequently used commercially , liability will apply to commercial users, 
  oh god , i remember coming across this a long time ago and thinking how awful it is . 
  it 's probably worth noting that `` expertvillage '' is pretty awful in general . 
  my understanding was that the stuttering was caused not from switching hands , but from being * forced * to switch hands . 
  no , not true at all . 
  in fact , they are legally required to use the same ingredients that you 'd get if you actually bought it . 
  the difference is that they spend hours carefully cooking it so that it looks perfect ( not necessarily tastes perfect ) and is positioned to show everything nicely in the photo . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itelte0cieg ), 
  edit : [ better video here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osd0kesj2w8 ) , the same one shared by / u/bananabm . 
  for the lazy , it 's a video from maccas showing how they make the burgers in their photos . 
  they 're still charging $ 50 for the lefty version , and only $ 40 for the right handed one . 
  the lefty version also is available in less styles , but i can understand the need for doing that due to lower demand . 
  charging more for it is unacceptable , though . 
   for rich kids in their parents basements where they have an old computer they set up on top of their new one because it looks cool, 
  or , you know , * anyone * who has two computers , most likely ( but not necessarily ) a desktop and a laptop , that they use at home . 
  clearly you are n't in the situation that this is a good product for you , but do n't think that just because you are n't , that the market for this product is miniscule . 
  yeah , print to pdf 's what i usually do , so simple . 
  and calling the page 's html source `` javascript '' just made me cringe . 
  got the reddit thread links for these ? 
  so , it sounds like almost all non canon ships ? 
  i ca n't say i 'm very familiar with the potter fandom . 
  what are some of the more out there ships ? 
  he also has a [ youtube channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/finalcutking ), 
  keep in mind that this is australia , but i imagine the same thing should apply in the us . 
  i pay just under $ 30 per month off contract for unlimited calls and sms , 4 gb data . 
  if i was on contract , i 'd be paying a minimum of about $ 60 , probably more like $ 80 or $ 90 and getting far less data , calls , and sms . 
  over the long run , that option is most definitely more expensive , even though the upfront cost is 0 . 
  it is very much worth looking into mvnos in your country . 
  i know i 've heard good things about ting , which is on the sprint network . 
  does this apply to the wadsworth constant ? 
  i learnt that notation for open intervals doing ib in highschool , and then had to switch to the other notation when i moved to australia for uni . 
  i have to say , i far prefer the notation that you 've just taught me is apparently french . 
  it makes far more sense . 
  using round vs. square brackets forces you to learn by heart when each one is , whereas with the french notation you can intuit it . 
  where 's / u/tau _ equals_2pi when you need him . 
  oh , and tau is clearly better than pi . 
  i do n't know about earlier version of html , but they can do some amazing things with html5 ( and css3 ) . 
  the definition of chaotic good . 
  can someone paste the text ( and maybe rehost pics on imgur ? ), 
  for people with [ murdoch block ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/murdoch-block/moepiacmhnmbiilhpojodnaopndhddpg?hl=en ) . 
  i thought that 's what / u/huslor was implying ? 
  had an exam saturday at 9:30 am . 
  went to bed at 6 am , woke up at 8:45 am . 
  went back to sleep at 1:30 pm , woke up at 7:00 pm . 
  i 'm still awake from that . 
  the fuck is wrong with me ? 
  from the looks of it you only want people from the us ? 
  the standard at my school was one teacher per subject , except for music , which had two teachers . 
  one for the set pieces and mli , one for composition and performance , both sharing pure theory ( though mainly the first ) . 
  that said , because of the nature of international schools , teachers leaving was not abnormal , so i had two teachers for each of physics hl , french sl , and economics sl , due to the teacher leaving after the first year . 
  for tok it was normal to be put in a different class for your second year , which may or may not be taken by the same teacher . 
  i suppose you 're using college as synonymous with university in this instance ? 
  ( the two terms have very different meanings here . ), 
  ~ ~ while i 'm asking , what do you mean by ` cheat sheet ' ? 
  is that something to be taken into an exam without invigilators knowing , or is it a sheet made up for revision purposes with just the most important information ? 
  because the latter is what the term ` cheat sheet ' would normally refer to , but using the term ` unauthorised ' makes it seem like you might mean the former . ~ ~ edit : removed because the first part was answered before the edit was finished . 
   is it difficult at all ? 
  short answer : yes . 
  long answer : it 's definitely non-trivial , and you should check the [ subreddit 's index ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/wiki/index ) for more information .

  cool , thanks . 
  done !, 
   did a lot of stupid things like calling volvo offices, 
  is this just a typo , or am i missing something really big ? 
  ~ ~ yes they could , but i imagine the number of devs that they 're working with would make that unfeasible . 
  it 's not something that can easily be computer generated . ~ ~, 
  edit : apparently not unfeasible . 
  see below . 
  huh , fair enough . 
  that is an awesome bit of tech , though . 
  i 'm not a web developer , so i do n't know for certain , but there are definitely apps that companies like google * claim * are done entirely in html5 . 
  people are going to leak the whole thing if they leak it , it lends credibility to their leak . 
  plus , if valve did something like this , they would likely do it * without * letting people know they were doing it . 
  ( heck , they may have already done it with this email . ), 
  people are n't going to * know * that leaking the info will give themselves away . 
   in fact , several people like it so much they want a stv for house of representatives , even greens, 
  stv , yes , because it produces a result that is more proportional to the actual preferences of voters . 
  but not stv with a ticket voting system like we currently see in the senate . 
  aww , really ? 
  when i lived there ( 2004 -- 2007 ) they had a man that would direct you to an empty parking space . 
  so much more awesome . 
  chermside 's had it for quite a while . 
  did you actually read the comment you were replying to , or just read the first sentence and assume you knew where it was going from there ? 
  it never mentioned interference with navigation systems . 
  it posited the idea that devices could become dangerous projectiles in the event of turbulence . 
  now , the argument itself was n't a good one ( if that 's true , why are n't books banned ? 
  besides , they do n't make you * put away * electronic devices , you could still be holding them in your hand , so long as they 're off . 
  ) , but you did n't even attempt to argue against what he actually said . 
  my reaction was the same . 
  this is a really sad story and i hope he 's successful , but the ( extremely ) small amount i learned about the game from this post makes me not want to even bother researching more about the game . 
  it just does n't seem to be my kind of game . 
  that 's a bullshit reason . 
  there 's absolutely nothing stopping people from sleeping during these times ( i 've done it regularly ) or reading ( the same ) . 
  often the inflight entertainment will still work during landing , even . 
  i do n't know about the engadget example , but reddit banned quickmeme a while back without any official announcement .
