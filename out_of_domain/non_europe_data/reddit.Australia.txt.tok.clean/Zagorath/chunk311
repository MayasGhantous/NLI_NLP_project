  all we got was a vague explanation that they were gaming things from the mods of large subreddits . 
  no hard evidence , no official announcement , nothing . 
  honestly , it 's complete bullshit in my opinion , but there you go . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  fair enough , i 'll grant that there was a lot of concrete evidence . 
  however , this was never communicated to us . 
  that some random blog wrote about it after pulling together various sources does n't mean that it was communicated correctly . 
  in fact , it should n't take a third party blog be the one to reveal concrete evidence of the ban . 
  regardless of the evidence and communication thereof , there 's still the fact that the ban itself was never communicated , except through mods a few subreddits . 
  never reddit itself . 
  cheers !, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  how many times have you seen `` i 'm sick of your bullshit , steve '' or something similar in the comments , when there was no indication of someone 's name whatsoever ? 
   your comments did not imply these were not your views nor that you were explaining how someone could believe there would be victims, 
  seemed pretty obvious that that was the case to me . 
  besides , even if you thought he was explaining his own view , you should n't have been downvoting him . 
  read [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/ywz5uo_3y_a?t=2m41s ) . 
  sounds pretty clearly like arnor to me . 
  that may not have been the intended line ( per the script ) , and it may not agree with the lore as presented in the books , but in the movie he quite clearly says arnor . 
  i 'm not really sure that 's the same sort of crazy . 
  this is just really , * really * passionate about something , the same as some people might be passionate about music , or technology , and that leads them to write incredible symphonies or create the latest innovation in computer hardware . 
  tolkien was just really passionate about his mythological world , in particular the languages within it . 
  not sure if you 're doing it deliberately to make a point , but the word here is capital . 
  capitol is a word that just applies to the name of a building . 
  yeah , austrian touristy shops are full of `` no kangaroos in austria '' signs . 
  i do n't know about that example , but [ far , far worse has happened ] ( http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/borat-national-anthem-accidentally-played-kazakh-athlete-video-224008124.html ) . 
   either through increased taxes ( which is n't possible ), 
  huh ? 
  taxes in the us are incredibly low compared to other countries , there 's no reason that taxes could n't be increased . 
  that is unless you 're arguing from the `` but americans would never allow their taxes to be increased '' standpoint , which is possibly true . 
  i thought so too ( in fact , that 's what i was looking for when i googled and found the above link ) , but i could n't find it . 
  there was a [ mix up with their flags ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-north-korea-flag ) , though . 
  i write music purely for my own enjoyment , and i know many people do the same . 
  sure you 'll share it online and hope a few people come across it , but the main aim is just expression for its own sake . 
  your ninja edit hits the nail on the head . 
  the total tax revenue as a percentage of gdp is 26.9 % . 
  compare to australia at 30.8 % , new zealand at 34.5 % , the uk at 39 % , and france at 44.6 % . 
  while nominally us corporate taxes are incredible , effective tax rates are as low as 12 % ( [ source ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424052970204662204577199492233215330.html ) , [ non-paywalled source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_tax_in_the_united_states ) ) . 
  the highest marginal tax rate is 40 % , and the [ effective payroll tax is at its highest just under 21 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_tax_in_the_united_states#effective_income_tax_rates ) . 
  but back to the original point , whatever the income and corporate taxes are , clearly the total revenue is n't as high as it could be . 
  perhaps the us needs a federal gst/vat , or more taxes aimed at things such as reducing externalities ( cigarette taxes in the us are significantly lower than other countries ) . 
  why not both ? 
  it 's more of a tautology , actually . 
  first of all , thank you for being a rational and compassionate human being . 
  far too many times i see a topic relating to cyclists brought up , and the majority opinion -- even on usually left-wing reddit -- is that cyclists are a waste of space and cars should n't have to deal with cyclists on the road . 
  it 's an entirely selfish and arrogant viewpoint . 
  i completely agree with you , so my argument is tentatively devil 's advocate , although not entirely . 
  my argument is that bike lanes are only marginally safer than not having them , since many drivers tend to ignore them if they 're concentrating on other things like changing lanes or turning . 
  instead , a better option is proper bike paths that are completely separated from the road . 
  as long as pedestrians are aware of them , it 's much safer than having cyclists ride on the road , regardless of whether or not there is a bike lane . 
  now , it is n't feasible in all cases , and it 's a lot more expensive , but in cases where it is feasible it 's much safer . 
  no what they said makes perfect sense . 
  they claim it was n't really their fault , but the way the law sees it is that the car is always in the wrong . 
  personally i 'd like to hear more about the story though , to get a better understanding of what exactly happened . 
  yeah i absolutely love his videos . 
  this one in particular is an * awesome * example of how to do advertising online correctly . 
  the entire video was an ad for a controller for smartphones . 
  the video itself is awesome quality , and it 's just fun , yet at the same time is entirely an ad . 
  love your videos , keep up the awesome work !, 
  i think this latest video is perhaps the single best example of online advertising done right . 
  awesome content in its own right , and yet still acts as a really good marketing tool -- showing in a humourous way the reason that the product being advertised is helpful . 
  awesome job , and i always look forward to seeing new videos when they pop up in my subscriptions feed !, 
   oh , actually the bible has supported [ insert modern day trend ] all along , we just needed to turn it upside down , replace every 5th word with every 3rd word , and choose whichever translation from greek , hebrew , or aramaic most benefits our cause !, 
  uhh , no offense , but there are huge numbers of things that you do n't have to twist the bible in the slightest bit to demonstrate that the bible is against something that people do every day . 
  the bible is full of internal contradictions as well as arguments against things that are , today , completely normal . 
  so the bible being against something , * even if you 're christian * is not a rational argument against it , if you try to take any small amount of reason . 
  i 'm not from the us , i 'm just stating what the previous comment made it seem like . 
  ok , so it 's pretty clear that the cyclist was completely and totally in the wrong here . 
  that said , none of this is even slightly a good argument for keeping cyclists off of the roads . 
  a bad rider , especially one under the influence , is always going to cause problems , just like the same is true of a driver . 
  by that logic , we should keep cars off of the roads , but what would be the sense in that ? 
  we should n't be punishing the vast majority of good citizens for actions of the tiny minority that do stupid things . 
  safety ... 
  i 'm guessing he 's australian , since it 's the first place that comes to mind that has helmet laws . 
  this is nothing more than confirmation bias . 
  you believe cyclists ride badly , and so you only notice those that * are * riding badly . 
  ones that ride according to the law go unnoticed , largely because they are less noticeable on account of not `` standing out '' . 
  i do n't know where you are , but based on the fact that you mention helmet wearing is law , i 'm going to guess australia . 
  there is * no * law regarding what clothes cyclists have to wear , and riding on the footpath is ( in queensland , at least ) completely legal , so you seem to be complaining about cyclists committing crimes that are , in fact , not crimes . 
   they learn that on certain roads it is safer to lane up , or under certain types of conditions it is safer to lain hora there than be in the bike lane, 
  could you clarify what this means , i could n't understand it . 
  great post , by the way . 
  i think it really gets to the heart of the issue . 
  i ca n't speak for / u/deanresin , but i understood that that is what you were saying , and i had the same feeling as they did . 
  if one party thinks they 're having intelligent debate , and the other is getting annoyed , then i would tend to judge the latter party harshly for , as deanresin said `` childish pride '' , though that is n't quite the word i would use . 
  plug for / r/changemyview, 
  as someone that loves mendelssohn , what pieces should i listen to to get into his music ? 
  so far i 'm only really familiar with the hebrides overture , which i absolutely love . 
  reminds me of that `` happy '' story from a while back . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/t70j8/a_semicompetent_genie_grants_you_two_wishes_out/c4k7ml5?context=4 ), 
  apparently it 's hard to make a 26 year old actress seem 16 , too . 
  i never realised she was meant to be that young in the show . 
  figured that the character ( on tv ) was more like early 20s . 
  i had the same problems at first , too , but then i went over to / r/thelastairbender and a bunch of other people explained it really well . 
  basically , the wording used in tla is that the original benders ( dragons , badger moles , sky bisons , the moon ) * taught * people how to bend . 
  however , that does n't conflict with the idea that people were given the * ability * to bend from elsewhere . 
  in * beginnings * , you see wan being taught fire bending by a dragon , and many people believe it is implied that he also learned other bending styles from the other original benders . 
  by the way , spirits never taught anyone how to bend .
