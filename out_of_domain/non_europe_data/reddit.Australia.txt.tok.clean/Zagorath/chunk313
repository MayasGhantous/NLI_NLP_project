  i 'm seeing a trend here , though . 
  wonder why the marvel films are coming out so late in the us ? 
  ( side note : hobbit part 2 does n't come out until boxing day here . 
  god dammit . ), 
  yeah thanks , someone else has pointed it out . 
  i was n't even aware there were any comics apart from the promise and the search before . 
  what if , once super powers have been introduced to this universe ( assuming that 's how flash will work ) , [ laurel somehow ( exactly how does n't matter right now ) got the actual black canary powers . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  without spoilers , how 's the line ? 
  i 've heard pretty good things about it , and i considering giving it a go . 
  ooo , both the arrows in this are lefties ( you can see at about 8:09 ) . 
  can anyone tell me if that 's a standard part of the lore , or just done for stylistic purposes in this shot ? 
  yeah no kidding . 
  i do n't even live in the uk . 
  no , really , she 's not my queen . 
  ^ not ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ wish, 
  ** possible spoilers to upcoming episodes from season 2 below **, 
  a ) [ yup ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2193021/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm ) ( do a ctrl/command - f for `` barry allen ), 
  b ) [ he 's set to appear in 3 episodes this season , 8 , 9 , and 20 ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/30/the-flash-spinoff-arrow-details_n_3679415.html ) . 
  i believe the speculation is that he wo n't be the flash for the first two appearances , and will probably get his powers ( again , if indeed he does actually get powers , and not do it with technology the way black canary works so far ) in episode 20 . 
  awesome , story , atmosphere , and choices are usually the most important thing in a game for me . 
  will definitely add it to my `` to play '' list !, 
  thanks !, 
  there 's [ sleep as android ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en ) if you 're an android user , too . 
  personally i do n't like it nearly as much as i liked sleep cycle on my ipod touch , but it does the job . 
  i would suggest do n't judge him ( or anyone ) until you 've actually seen him in the role . 
  perhaps they saw something in him that just clicked with their vision of the character . 
  heck , if you compare the actor of oliver himself in this show to the portrayal of oliver/green arrow in the animated universe , you 'd certainly not think that it 's a good pick . 
  i would tend to agree , but i would also posit that perhaps there is probably no such thing as a person who was 100 % bad . 
  i mean , yes there are people that you can call `` bad '' , but even in the most extreme cases , they had * some * redeeming factors . 
  hitler is probably the most famous one , as he did wonders for the german economy pre-war , and he also had an immense love of animals . 
  shame that love did n't extend to humans , but there you go . 
  yes i would say without hesitation that hitler was a `` bad person '' , but even he had redeeming qualities . 
  australia . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_nazi_germany ) , real wages increased by 10 % from '33 to ' 38 , and unemployment was `` practically extinct '' . 
  ( which , at least according to keynesian theory , is n't such a great thing , since 100 % employment should result in inflation . 
  i could n't find any actual data on inflation over that period . ), 
  they did take on massive debt , but that is n't in and of itself a bad thing , and their ability to repay it without the war is a matter that 's up for debate , but i doubt anyone could give a decisive answer to that hypothetical . 
  edit : whoops , completely forgot to actually add the link . 
  according to the article , a ` noodle ' is kind of what they were looking for . 
  they wanted someone who is incredibly athletic , but not ripped like oliver . 
   barry allen is n't typically a very physical guy . 
  that said , he 's got to be athletic and he 's gon na be running around quite a bit ... but he wo n't have to do those crazy pull-ups . 
  how true that is to the original character is something i ca n't comment on , not being a reader of the comics . 
  but i will always maintain a policy of refraining from judgement until i see them in the show , and how it fits in that context . 
  ok , so / u/oakenbeam 's response to this comment was ... interesting , let 's say . 
  but in all seriousness , what was it that led you to declare so authoritatively that he does n't have much understanding of social science ? 
  i just took that as a theory someone came up with . 
  mine is hands down the askreddit thread about the semi-competent genie who grants you two wishes out of a list , but each has certain restrictions . 
  [ here 's the thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/t70j8/a_semicompetent_genie_grants_you_two_wishes_out/ ) . 
  some of the stories and possibilities to come out of that thread were incredible . 
  in particular , the story one user wrote about `` happy '' was amazing , especially when combined with the alternate ending someone else came up with . 
  plot twist : this happened in an airport . 
  it was a genuine question . 
  eh , if he knows a yard , it would be better to say a metre is a yard plus a little bit . 
  i 'd be willing to trade fear 2 or 3 for something . 
  pm ( or just reply , either 's fine ) any offers you like , but particularly from [ this list ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hbxqwmnwjo701c85iglznj4o8mmfikhupg7guhz0r7s/edit?usp=sharing ) . 
  are you in the eu ? 
  because if you are n't that does n't apply to you . 
  it certainly does n't apply to all the people here who are n't from the eu ( e.g. , usa , australia ) . 
  i seem to recall what you 're talking about , so i 'm not sure what 's going on here , but they * specifically * created the option of sharing the keys as a gift , so i 'm assuming that they 're ok with it . 
  specifically , the `` appeal to motive '' fallacy . 
  not very creatively named . 
  that may be a part of their fud tactics . 
  the fact that it receives no security updates is something specifically chosen * by microsoft * . 
  i 'm a little confused . 
  you 've got a computer that 's at least 6 years old , and yet it 's still a powerhouse ? 
  how good * is * this thing ? 
  it musta been ** blazing ** fast when it was brand new . 
  with regards to portal , if you play it i would suggest remapping the blue and orange portals to q and e . it makes things much easier without a mouse with physical left and right buttons . 
  may i ask what your title is ? 
  edit : and which subject is it in ? 
  based on the survey it does n't seem to actually be a music ee . 
  i did n't say they should , i was merely pointing out that trying to get people off of xp involves some use of fear , uncertainty , and doubt tactics . 
  ( [ we already know who 's going to be flash ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2193021/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm ) -- do a ctrl/command - f for `` barry allen '' ), 
  see , this is why english would benefit from more brackets . 
  / u/gitemstevedave clearly meant, 
   but i 'd rather be ( accused of reinforcing gender stereotypes ) than ( attending a kids funeral ), 
  but grammatically it 's also valid to interpret as you jokingly did, 
   but i 'd rather be accused of ( reinforcing gender stereotypes ) than ( attending a kids funeral ), 
   when confused by any noun or verb , search that word or phrase only, 
  if it 's a single word , google `` define [ the word ] '' . 
  google will give you the definition of the word in a card at the top . 
  j/c ? 
  which end of it ? 
  particularly if it 's the actual ` mouthpiece ' end , it 's probably because of all the spit from playing it . 
  saliva contains a large amount of electrolytes , which conduct electricity . 
  i 'm curious , what are you using to browse ? 
  alien blue on ios can edit comments , and reddit is fun on android can too . 
  but regarding the definition thing , i suppose it really depends on the context in which you need to know about something . 
  if it 's just a word that you do n't know , often the definition is helpful , but if it 's a concept that you are n't grasping , you 'll need more than that . 
  if it 's an awkward accident then it 's fine , but being `` a kid with your head up your own ass '' is not an excuse . 
  if you recognise you 're doing this , then make an effort to * change * . 
  and apparently ios too . 
  i have no idea how that would work given apple 's restrictions , but apparently they can do it . 
  no , i remember that story , and it was one of their competitors . 
  i ca n't remember exactly which one , but it may have been [ hidden ] ( http://hiddenapp.com/ ) , or possibly [ undercover ] ( http://orbicule.com/undercover/ ) .

  some people recommend the best of both worlds .
