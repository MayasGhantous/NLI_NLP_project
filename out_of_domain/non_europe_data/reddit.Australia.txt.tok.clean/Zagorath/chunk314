  seriously dude ? 
  the only people that bother with proper capitalisation * must * be viral marketers ? 
  i have n't used it since january when i got an android phone , but it was definitely possible then . 
  they may have removed that feature since . 
  if they have n't , i * think * they way you go about it is by tapping on the comment so that the options appear ( same way you upvote/downvote ) , and then tap the pencil icon . 
  that 's not how i 'd define fud . 
  it 's simply an acronym for fear , uncertainty , and doubt . 
  now while the connotations are as you described , it does n't technically need to be false information . 
  taking the same quote from the wikipedia article :, 
   fud is ** generally ** a strategic attempt to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information . 
  not always , but generally . 
  hmm that 's a shame ... [ you do n't get anything looking like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/alienblue/wiki/iphone#wiki_editing_.26_making_changes_to_a_comment ) ? 
  god dammit . 
  good point . 
  we 're in the wrong subreddit for this , but here , have a delta anyway . 
  eh , it was a thing far earlier than that, 
   in 1346 , the bodies of mongol warriors of the golden horde who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged crimean city of kaffa . 
  it has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the advent of the black death in europe . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_warfare ), 
  it may have been a myth in that case , but, 
   the british army used smallpox in new south wales in 1789 having attempted to use it as a weapon earlier when they gave contaminated blankets to the lenape during pontiac 's war ( 1763 -- 66 ) .

  my biggest problem with your example is it only works if you twist the pronunciation of the word sikh . 
  i like the reference , but in all seriousness , \uac08\ube44 ( galbi ) is amazing . 
  nah mate , do n't listen to them yanks . 
  their barbequeing is n't really barbequeing . 
  to them , a barbeque is n't where you stick the meat on a barbie , it 's a slow technique with an indirect heat source . 
  what with the 5th symphony being the first major work featuring trombones and piccolos , this concert seems to have had a lot of firsts . 
  grilling is n't a thing in australia , and a barbeque is [ this ] ( http://joelcomiskeygroup.com/images/blog/barbeque.jpg ) . 
  no , what i 'm talking about is barbequeing . 
  americans might call it grilling , but the term in the rest of the anglosphere ( with the possible exception of canada , they 're always hard to predict ) is barbequeing . 
  you do n't get to decide how the english language works in every country outside of north america . 
  anyone got a mirror for this ? 
  i 'm assuming it 's blocked outside of the us , but i ca n't tell for sure , it 's not giving any message . 
  just refuses to load , and when i right click it says `` movie not loaded ... '' and the standard about flash message . 
  clicking `` playback issues ? '', 
  just takes me to [ this ] ( http://www.cwtv.com/page/no-access.html ) 404 page . 
  it 's usually best to avoid initialisms when there 's ambiguity . 
  to my knowledge , bb usually refers to beast boy in the dc universe . 
  something something porn, 
  i 'd probably visit the premier of le sacre , because i 'm a badass like that . 
  it 's fairly well known , to be honest . 
  uhh ... if you think the us invented barbeque , you might want to look into its history . 
  wow , it 's been a while since i 've come across such a dumb , ignorant , comment here on reddit . 
  kinda ironic , given your last sentence . 
  here 's what wikipedia has to say :, 
   in british usage , barbecuing refers to a fast cooking process directly over high heat , while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct , high heat -- known in the united states and canada as broiling . 
  in american english usage , however , grilling refers to a fast process over high heat , while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat and/or hot smoke ( very similar to some forms of roasting ) . 
  the point is , it is * entirely * an issue of language , and dogmatically claiming that your usage is the `` correct '' one , is immensely ignorant and intolerant . 
  barbies are an integral part of aussie cuisine , and we have just as much right to our usage of the term as you do . 
  ( not to mention that both england -- you know , the place that invented the language -- and our neighbours over in nz also use the term to refer to what you call ` grilling ' . 
  so that pretty much covers the anglosphere outside of north america . ), 
  mmm i like it . 
  not even an attempt to refute my claim , and yet no admission of fault in yours . 
  truly the sign of a weak mind . 
  no , it 's a realisation that i 'm not speaking with a rational human being , and that it is n't worth wasting too much more of my time arguing with you . 
  good day . 
  i was in the middle of a rather less humourous debate on the same topic with someone else , so i missed the tone . 
  ok i 'm with you on the weight , but is the minuscule amount of flex in wood really something that makes any difference ? 
  on the other hand i can really see how william tell 's call to the cows would calm people . 
  the title of this is confusing . 
  it sounds like the sydney opera house ( a * building * -- not a person -- located in sydney , australia ) is interviewing avro p\u00e4rt , and the interview is taking place in tallinn , estonia . 
  the article did n't really clarify this point , either . 
  good read , though , and the video was fantastic . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  yeah , the second one seems to me to be sort of sarcastic . 
  point being ? 
  dls ? 
  but i agree , my initial response to this was `` capricornia needs to happen '' , mainly because seq is less right wing than the rest of the state , and i 'm from brisbane . 
  it would make public transportation between cities more necessary , while lowering the cost efficiency of local public transportation . 
  but is n't his plan to replace the ets with `` pay people to plant trees '' ? 
  brisbanite here and daylight saving is the stupidest thing anyone ever came up with . 
  you ca n't get more hours in the day by causing a spike in suicides on a yearly basis . 
  there 's a statistical spike in suicide rates on the day of the switch . 
  you ca n't get more hours in the day through daylight saving , just shifting the time by an hour does n't reasonably make any difference . 
  there 's also a statistical spike in suicides on the day that the switch is made . 
  seems a really unfair point to make , and extremely tenuous * at best * . 
  an interesting question . 
  i suspect that it has n't been legally decided yet , but my guess is that if it were to come up , the answer would be no . 
  not itself the best source , but it does reference actual studies . 
  it also describes other health risks like heart problems , also associated with the switch . 
  yeah that 's true , op ( not by , btw ) did add that in , which seemed a bit odd to me , too . 
  but while `` seems more likely '' might hold * some * weight , i would argue it 's negligible . 
   if you 'd like to be a part , you 'll be able to check us out at kickstarter from november 13th . 
  the kickstarter wo n't go live until then . 
   think it 's better to legislate change to your time measurement system a couple of times a year is better than having individuals and organisations take charge of their own schedules to suit daylight changes . 
  this ** so ** much . 
  there 's literally no realistic reason to change the clocks for this . 
  if it matters to enough people , businesses can change their hours . 
  but then , i 'm against it anyway , because it still being light at 9 o'clock is just plain weird . 
  if anything , they should be shifting * backwards * . 
  as / u/test _ alpha said, 
   [ you guys ] think it 's better to legislate change to your time measurement system a couple of times a year is better than having individuals and organisations take charge of their own schedules to suit daylight changes, 
  but yeah , regarding the suicide thing , i was stunned when i found out . 
  there 's also a rise in heart problems , and i * think * i remember reading there was also a rise in car accidents ( but i could be wrong on that last one ) . 
   it was actually called an `` akademie , '' meaning that it was not a concert for the casual , typical , concert-goer . 
  huh , til . 
  i knew all the rest of the stuff , but that definitely changes my perspective of the concert . 
  i had heard it was a miserable experience -- the room was uncomfortably hot , it was really , really long -- but thinking that it was a standard concert-going audience rather than the musical elite that i expect were there based on your description of it as an `` akademie '' really makes a big difference .
