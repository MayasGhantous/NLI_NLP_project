  i probably wo n't go out of my way to see it , but if it ever comes up i probably will . 
  the actual physics behind it is the same if you 're moving forward or if you 're completely still ( assuming ` moving forward ' is really ` moving forward with constant velocity ' ) . 
  you 'd slow down by x amount . 
  if you were completely still , you would start moving backwards by x amount . 
  good luck , although for reasons explained [ here ] ( https://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) ( link also in the sidebar ) , i 've usually recommended against rearranging keys . 
  exactly , that 's what 's so annoying about it . 
  i guess i was lucky , i did see this before , but i just assumed it was iroh ii , which is somewhat less of a massive reveal , but in general the spoilers can be really frustrating . 
  using that logic , could one say there are n't * any * venomous animals that kill directly ? 
  is flying no longer a thing ? 
  i 'm also using f.lux , at 2800 kelvin ( slightly hotter than tungsten ) , and i can see the different colours just fine . 
  just tested it , turned all the way down , and i can still quite clearly differentiate . 
  honestly , this just feels like a forced plug for f.lux . 
  karl orff 's carmina burana has some pretty great themes . 
  the famous `` o fortuna '' is about fate , and the other movements delve into themes of the fickleness of wealth , and the pleasures and perils of drinking , gluttony , gambling , and lust , etc. , before finally returning to a reprise of o fortuna in an absolutely incredible finale , as the wheel continues to turn . 
  pretty much the entirety of the film '' [ le concert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_concert ) '' is absolutely fantastic . 
  that 's correct . 
  but ... how is it relevant , exactly ? 
  `` lord of the rings aficionado '' . 
  i think we had a conversation regarding the silmarillion earlier this year . 
  oh yeah , let 's make all the people who want to avoid spoilers go and unsubscribe from this subreddit and then resubscibe once they 've watched it every single week . 
  that 's a much better idea than just asking people to not put spoilers in the title of their posts , i ca n't believe no one thought of it before . 
  i see plenty of posts on here that manage to create interesting titles without resorting to spoilers . 
  there 's no reason the rest could n't . 
   i 'm sorry , but ` unquestionable talent ' ? 
  serious ? 
  yes . 
  she 's actually a classically trained musician , and if that does n't qualify as `` unquestionably talented '' , i do n't know what does . 
  well , yeah . 
  the pai sho game on this site is clearly * not * pai sho from the show . 
  1 ) could be `` he died doing what he loved '' , or , even better , something talking about the viewer 's reaction to seeing that moment, 
  2 ) i would n't consider a spoiler, 
  3 ) not much of a spoiler as is , but could be amended to simply `` from the next episode '' or something like that, 
  4 ) `` why i hate unalaq '' . 
  this one was a particularly bad spoiler to begin with, 
  5 ) not necessarily a spoiler ( could be interpreted as metaphorical ) . 
  alternatively , it could just stop after the comma . 
  `` this has probably occurred to others '' . 
  6 ) `` great advice '', 
  7 ) could have left the explanation to the comments ( or made it a self post ) , and just said `` possible reference to miyazaki and spirited away ? ) . 
  honestly i felt like that was a pretty terrible post anyway . 
  8 ) hardly a spoiler, 
  it 's not the lack of a / s tag , it 's the fact that even if this was sarcastic , it really would n't be very funny . 
  it took me way too long to get that joke ... probably because i was pronouncing the electorate in my head with the french pronunciation . 
  how is the actual electorate pronounced , out of curiosity ? 
   you ca n't have your cake and eat it too, 
  well you can , but only for half the year !, 
  ah cheers, 
  no , because by definition entrapment is when the police officer gets you to do something that you would n't have otherwise done on your own . 
  it 's why officers impersonating minors on online chat sites to catch pedophiles is n't entrapment , for example . 
  we would have , at some point , stepped out of the car , yes . 
  the point is , stepping out of his car , whether on private property or public , is not something that he would n't do . 
  i do n't understand security all that well , but the extremely high-profile security expert steve gibson [ highly recommends it ] ( http://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg?t=52m45s ) . 
  if security is your issue with it , that 's not a reason not to use it . 
  they shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old :, 
  age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn . 
  at the going down of the sun and in the morning ,, 
  we will remember them . 
  lest we forget . 
  on a note relating to the music , nimrod is an awful piece for a highschool orchestra to play . 
  even if they can do ok in most music , the technical difficulty of nimrod is really , really low , and so the problem of expressivity and subtlety is really exaggerated , which does n't work well in an orchestra that struggles to play in tune with each other . 
  just something i learned when we played this in my highschool orchestra . 
  the simplest thing would be to take music for two violins and just play one part up a tone . 
  depending on the difficulty of the piece , you may be able to do this on sight , or you may have to copy it out . 
  it 's not very difficult , it 's just every note up a tone . 
  if you have a copy of sibelius ( and if you do n't , i strongly recommend grabbing one , it 's an indispensable tool for any musician ) you can write it out into there and get sibelius to do the transposition for you . 
  that episode really brought the nutters out of the woodwork in the audience . 
  right before it was perhaps the best episode of media watch i 've seen in a while , though . 
  most of the episode was taken up with a rather scathing indictment of the abc 's catalyst 's episodes about heart disease . 
  the way this person writes their bs and ps is really annoying . 
  makes the p look like an r , and the b look like a v , u , or maybe even l ( lower case ) . 
  very clever , though . 
  i got ta be honest , out of the three photos shared by the two of you , my favourite was the harbour bridge one , but my favourite as a wallpaper was your leaf one . 
  i 'm on mobile right now , so i ca n't check , but is it high enough resolution for a ( desktop ) wallpaper ? 
  and if so , would you mind me adding it to my collection ? 
  how does one work out what the focal point is for a given glass of water ? 
  ( without experimentation , obviously . ), 
  ah thanks . 
  after seeing op 's ` shop , i was looking for the original photo . 
  i 'm playing through ** the witcher ** . 
  it 's an absolutely incredible game , and i absolutely love the way your choices come back to bite you ( or to help you ! ), 
  later on , although the cutscenes where geralt explains the choice back to you are a bit unnecessary : i know what choices i made , and i can see how it 's impacting me , you do n't need to remind me . 
  but the game is totally worth it , and i 'm so glad i went to all the effort of getting it to work ( wine port ) , and it 's still worth it even with the constant crashes ( just got ta remember to save regularly ) . 
  i bought dragon age 1 and 2 when i was in the uk . 
  game had a 3 for # 10 deal , so i thought why not ? 
  really looking forward to getting around to those two games . 
  hmm that 's interesting . 
  do you have any sources that i could use to read more about the comparison of the two styles ? 
  i still need to play bioshock ** 1 ** . 
  i had someone giving it a strong recommendation as far back as 2008/9 , and i 've been * seriously * meaning to get around to it since 2010 , but just ... never did . 
  i played through the whole way and daxter was a heap of fun !, 
  the version i downloaded had the commentary as a second audio track built in to the file . 
  doubtless they 've got the same thing on the actual dvd of the show . 
  are you referring to the one shown directly above the arrow on aang 's head ? 
  i see your point , but reddit is a hell of a lot more than an avatar forum , and besides , there are plenty of other things that people can talk about in this space ( / r/tla ) that do n't contain spoilers . 
  putting spoilers in the title of your post is * incredibly * easily avoided , and quite frankly plain rude . 
  even people who do n't actively seek it out will see it in their reddit front page . 
  it 's common decency to try to avoid spoiling things for others where you can , and reddit makes that * so * easy to do . 
  just ** do n't put a spoiler in the title ** , and then mark it as a spoiler in the title , as well as using this subreddit 's styling for a spoiler tag . 
  hmm thanks . 
  i 've got ta be honest , this makes it seem more or less the same as most western literature .
