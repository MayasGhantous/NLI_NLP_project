  youtube needs an anti-spam mechanism to stop people linking to shock content like you described , but having links is itself an entirely good thing . 
   i agree completely regarding novelty accounts , and with top comments . 
  top comments should be based mainly on upvotes , probably using some time element a la reddit , also taking into account the viewer 's relation to that person ( i want to see comments from my friends pushed up higher , for example , but other people who do n't know them do n't need to see them ) . 
   it 's important to note that this new comment system change also introduced a number of more powerful controls over the comments for the video uploader , and i think those need to be extended , and systems should be put in place to better avoid spammy comments and spam links , but overall this new comment system is by far a positive change , if only people could see past their own blind hate for any change . 
  i think this guy really knows what he 's talking about , and he sounds absolutely correct . 
  google + is n't * a * google product . 
  the name kind of implies what it is . 
  it 's just * google * , plus more . 
  it 's an extension of google , the glue bringing together all of your online interactions . 
  that 's what google + is . 
  that 's what it has always been intended as . 
  if you do n't like it , that 's a different issue , but that 's the way google 's moving forward , and from an objective standpoint it makes your user experience more streamlined . 
  it absolutely boggles my mind that people are complaining about the unlimited text thing . 
  the 500 character limit was one of the most infuriating things about the old comment system , it made it absolutely possible to have any real conversation . 
  inline comments is great because it means you can have conversations involving multiple people without having to repeat yourself half a dozen times . 
  everyone is on the same page and reading the same thing . 
  people are resistant to change . 
  we see this every time any site makes a change . 
  youtube and facebook are perhaps the biggest ones , although similar things have happened with other companies in the past ( remember the office ribbon ? ) . 
  in the long run , people come to accept the change or recognise that it was , in fact , a net improvement . 
  that 's exactly what will happen here , despite the huge number of people complaining right now . 
  that 's not to say the system is n't without flaws , though . 
  the algorithm that decides which comments are at the top is one of the biggest flaws in the current system . 
  if someone posts a hateful comment and it gets a lot of replies correcting it , that hateful initial comment will get floated to the top because the algorithm views ` lots of replies ' as a major factor in how high the comment appears . 
  that 's obviously a problem . 
  the comments that appear at the top should be decided by a few factors , including :, 
  * a reddit-like algorithm of upvotes versus time, 
  * the relation of the viewer to the commenter ( if my friend has commented on the video , i want to see their comment higher , but someone who does n't know them wo n't ), 
  * uploader comments and comments with * replies * from uploaders should be higher . 
  it 's worth noting that one of the best new features of the new comment system is that creators have strong moderation tools at their disposal now . 
  they can automatically filter out comments based on key words , for example you could put `` this is bob '' in if that sort of comment is annoying you , and automatically filter that out . 
  but i agree , seeing these everywhere is incredibly annoying , and i 'm making a point to go through and mark a bunch of them as spam . 
  you should too . 
  except that there 's never been ( and never * will * be ) a study that shows the nutters who think we should get rid of government and replace it with businesses are right . 
  never will be , because it is n't true . 
  that 's not how my highschool worked . 
  most activities were once per week , with special rehearsals or practices sometimes scheduled close to a big event . 
  my lord , i have a cunning plan . 
  you mean the one with a heap of * business people * on it ? 
  the one that had an enormous amount of pro-right questions and panellists ? 
  just because they did n't integrate youtube 's comment system into it until now does n't mean that they have n't been slowly but surely integrating it into a variety of other google services , including blogger , drive , android , etc. 
  they 're doing this change bit by bit , but that does n't mean they do n't have a definite end goal . 
  i do n't have a fucking clue . 
  i do n't work at google , i do n't know exactly what their current system looks like in coding . 
  even if i did , exactly how it looks would depend on exactly how much weight you want to give to each of those characteristics . 
  but i 'm not sure i see your point . 
  yup , more or less . 
  the only sporting team that i can think of that practised more than once per week was swimming , which practised before school twice a week . 
  athletics and volleyball were definitely once per week , and i 'm fairly sure soccer and basketball only practised one day a week . 
  i ca n't think of any other sports off the top of my head that we actually had a ` team ' for , although there were plenty of activities done more just for fun , like fencing and badminton , which were also once per week . 
  musical rehearsals were the same . 
  apart from the lead-up ( usually only the last * two * days , or a few weeks in the case of the band accompanying the musical ) to a concert , it was one rehearsal per week for orchestra , concert band , jazz band , choir , etc. 
  really ? 
  i 'm sitting at a desk right now and i can quite comfortably do about 15 -- 20 \u02da more than that . 
  no , i agree completely . 
  you do n't necessarily need unlimited space . 
  reddit 's 10,000 character limit works just fine ; i 've only ever once run up against the limit . 
  the problem stems from the fact that on google + , which some people use as a proper blogging platform to replace wordpress or blogger , unlimited comment length really * is * necessary . 
  they could ( presumably ) quite easily put in a limit exclusive to youtube . 
  i think it would be accurate to say that the area was n't particularly competitive . 
  we competed against the 4 or 5 other international schools in our area , and my school usually performed quite well in the competitions . 
  i do n't really have the technical knowledge to do my own wine ports . 
  i downloaded wineskin winery and used it to get the witcher working better than the version downloaded straight from steam , but any more than that and i 'd be way out of my depth . 
  i 'm willing to trade :, 
  any/all of the 3 fear games, 
  the mortal kombat collection, 
  the gotham city impostors professional kit, 
  the arkham origin skin pack, 
  if you 've got anything you 're willing to trade for them , let me know . 
  edit : wtf is with the downvotes ? 
  the thread is clearly about trading games from the latest humble bundle and that 's exactly what i 'm trying to do here . 
  i do n't get it . 
  you 're complaining that google + has the same content that makes facebook popular ? 
  because i fail to see the difference . 
  i was disappointed that something referencing this was n't one of the top comments . 
  nope , not on android on phones . 
  to change the orientation lock in native android on a phone you actually have to go into the settings . 
  except that that 's a bullshit excuse . 
  they do n't stop you from sleeping , or reading a book , and i 've only occasionally been stopped from listening to music with the screen off . 
  those activities are just as much going to make you not pay attention to the pre-flight talk as using actual technology . 
  / r/eroticliterature is a thataway . 
  for me it 's similar . 
  for me it 's that bullshit ` doge ' stuff that people do . 
  wow such atheist, 
  so brave, 
  much muchness, 
  wow do not, 
  wow, 
  it 's just infuriatingly asinine . 
  i 'm glad i was n't the only one that thought of this . 
  especially with deadshot and his glowing red eye . 
  that really reminded me of zuko 's scar . 
  \\* sigh *, 
  i wish they had n't cancelled that show ... 
  i do n't understand how they could n't just pretend to no longer be together for the remainder of the trial . 
  a bit of a chaotic neutral ? 
  oh , i have to say that is n't an argument i 've ever really seen . 
  from my standpoint , it 's always been that the technology is better . 
  ** circles ** make sharing content to people for whom it 's actually relevant , and seeing content that 's actually relevant , much simpler than facebook 's awful `` lists '' . 
  ** communities ** are an awesome feature that function much like subreddits do on reddit , and you can discuss things with random strangers who share similar interests .
