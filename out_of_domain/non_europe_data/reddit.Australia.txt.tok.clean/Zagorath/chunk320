  ** hangouts ** are the absolute best feature , though , and i have many friends who never use g + except when we 're having a hangout . 
  up to 10 people video chatting at one time , completely free of charge . 
  on a slight tangent , ** photos ** and their integration with android are brilliant . 
  auto-awesome is an amazing feature for people who take photos for fun , rather than art ( and can even be fun when combined with more artistic shots ) . 
  but i would n't say the content is all that much better . 
  it really depends on who you circle . 
  if you 're only circling people who foster intelligent conversation -- such as many of the tech journos who report on these things -- then you probably will see a better level of communication . 
  but if you 're circling the same people as you would friend on facebook , then you wo n't see any difference from that standpoint . 
  yeah i 'm aware of that , that 's why i was very careful to emphasise that i was talking about vanilla / native android . 
  i actually do already have an app that does that kind of thing , although the screen lock is n't really important enough to me that i put it in there . 
  you do realise that the death penalty , with its massive and completely necessary appeals process , actually costs taxpayers more than life in gaol . 
  no no , it 's effect . 
  because otherwise medical prices would n't be a thing . 
  oh man , so jealous . 
  i 'd love to see a mahler symphony live . 
  i came so close to seeing the fifth at the bbc proms when i was in the uk a while back , but went to see the rachmaninov concerto and nielsen symphony instead -- largely for the benefit of my family who i was seeing it with . 
  eh , it 's no worse than the britten + dog one . 
  beethoven was the one i was going to recommend . 
  path\u00e9tique and moonlight ( the whole thing , not just the first movement ) were the first to spring to mind . 
  appassionata is great too . 
  i 'd also recommend satie 's gnossiennes and gymnopedies . 
  edit : did n't mention this because i thought someone else already had , but i just checked and i was wrong . 
  chopin 's preludes are another really good place to start , and maybe the nocturns too . 
  yeah it was really good . 
  the pianist was blind too . 
  absolutely incredible . 
  i wish someone could explain why people find this funny . 
  to me it just seems juvenile and asinine . 
  what would go in the mailing list when it gets started up ? 
  classic example of muphry 's law . 
  it was rach 2 , as well as nielsen 4 , and the premier of a piece that i really enjoyed called `` a vision of the sea '' . 
  [ the programme ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2013/july-16/14560 ), 
  but yeah , that 's a good point . 
  1 , 2 , and 5 i would definitely want to see . 
  probably 8 too just for the sheer size of it . 
  i 'm not really that familiar with the others . 
  huh ? 
  the good thing is that / r/classicalmusic * is n't * rife with it . 
  you get it occasionally , but for the most part we 're extremely welcoming to anything vaguely related to the music we so love . 
  are these the kids from union college uq ? 
  i heard that they were doing something like this . 
  '' ~ '' is an indicator of sarcasm . 
  i was making a joke about the use of effect as a verb , such as `` to effect change '' . 
  it basically means to * make * something . 
  assuming it 's the fellas from union college uq ( who i recently heard were doing something like this ) , i believe they were saving them up all year . 
  it was union , surprisingly enough . 
  surely this is hdr , no ? 
  eh , i 'm not sure it was a joke that really made any sense to begin with . 
  * how is one supposed to get from `` rache '' to `` rage '' ? 
  there 's no logical connection, 
  * that whole bit in brakcets is just a complete non sequitur . 
  well great news mate . 
  they did write a review . 
  i 'm not going to comment on whether or not i believe you specifically or whatever , but you raised the point that was the first thing to come to my mind upon seeing this post . 
  i 've known the premise of what op 's post says for a while now : once you have enough money that you are n't worried about your income , more money does n't increase happiness . 
  what the problem with op 's claim is , is that the exact figure is ridiculous . 
  it varies from area to area . 
  a person living in rural vietnam could have enough money to not have to worry about any expenses on an amount significantly less than 75,000 usd , while someone in sydney is probably going to need a good deal more than that . 
  and yet the discussion in this thread is of a much higher calibre and is much more interesting than the conversation on that thread . 
  ah , thanks . 
  oh thanks for this tip . 
  i 've just been playing through it and i 've been saving really frequently . 
  i have to , because i 'm playing a shitty wineskin version that crashes frequently . 
  i 'll have to remember to go through and delete a bunch of saves . 
  probably well past the statute of limitations by now , is n't it ? 
  south sudan has n't signed it , either . 
  but i guess you have to give them a break considering they 've only existed for like 2 and a half years . 
  i for one find it refreshing to see a rational stance on the issue rather than the usual blind * ermegurd it 's all changed , i hate google + * that most people have been going into . 
  wait , you 're saying i did n't need to give my firstborn to microsoft ? 
  ok i 'm writing this without looking at any of the lower comments because i have n't seen any of the episodes . 
  thank you ** so ** much mods for the reminder about spoilers in titles . 
  as someone who does n't and ca n't watch episodes live , i 'm so glad for this new rule . 
  i hope you guys continue that rule on when book 3 comes out . 
  ** keep up the awesome work mods !, 
  i ca n't believe i never thought of this solution before . 
  it 's * so simple * . 
  all i have to do to avoid spoilers is just * not ever go on reddit until i 'm caught up with every show i watch * . 
  thank you so much !, 
  that 's funny , i thought this was one of their best yet . 
  i think dawe 's frustrated persona in this video fit the role he was trying to portray . 
  that 's what the side button on the mouse is for !, 
   you ca n't trade in pc games to offset the cost of a new title though, 
  ca n't you ? 
  i do n't live in the uk , but i thought game does this . 
  even if they do n't you can still get incredible deals on pc gaming through a combination of retail store sales , steam sales , and humble bundles . 
  this is the most important one , i feel . 
  sure , pcs have plenty of exclusives , and as a pc gamer i would n't want to give up my rts games and all the random little indie things . 
  but heavy rain , last of us , and beyond : two souls all look * so * ** incredible ** that i ca n't help but feel a little jealous of the ps3 gamers sometimes . 
  i still prefer project natal over `` kinect '' . 
  edit : somebody beat me too it . 
  disregard this . 
  no that 's the ps move . 
  i could be wrong , but i think the version on + oleg berg 's account are digitally altered . 
  so it 's not really representative of how the piece * actually * sounds in a major key , because you get weirdness from altering the pitch of the recording . 
  hmm , that one 's not quite to my taste . 
  i found it somewhat funny , but it was n't anything really special , to me . 
  still , i think that says something . 
  they can do a really wide variety of comedy that appeals to a wide variety of different tastes , and they can do it really well . 
  yeah , it 's mainly about the feeling , and the fact that people are inherently wired to think short term , and in general the liberals * are * better short term economic managers -- even if that comes at a massive cost of long term gain . 
  i was gon na say that this sounds more bogan than chav , and then i noticed your username .
