  yeah i had the same reaction . 
  except it 's 4:30 here , so 1:30 where my mum is . 
  plus i 'm leaving to go back home tonight , so it 's not all that urgent . 
  what the fuck people . 
  are you seriously downvoting this ? 
  ( it 's standing at 5 up , 5 down as i look . ), 
  sure it 's a torrent link , and that 's not really a legit way of getting it . 
  but you know what ? 
  * neither is using a proxy to pretend you 're in the us * . 
  if these companies are n't going to release their shows on a timely basis to all of the show 's fans , then people are going to seek alternative methods , and torrents just happen to be one of the most convenient of those methods . 
  very curious timing with this reply . 
  crashcourse us history just recently came out with a video of their own regarding the korean ( and vietnamese ) war ( s ) . 
  [ it 's worth watching ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2icmlkuhg0 ) . 
  fair point . 
  my understanding ( obligatory ianal ) is that it 's a very grey legal area , and has n't been tested in court or in legislature . 
  here 's [ wan article ] ( http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/493576/circumventing_region-locking_access_netflix_may_illegal/ ) that i came up with in a quick search . 
  but in general you 're probably right , it 's not something that appears to be illegal . 
  ok the tweets are totally wat , but that quote is largely correct . 
  in a general sense , good sportspeople are good sportspeople . 
  americans are incredibly good at gridiron , basketball , and baseball because those are the popular sports that all the best athletes try to get into . 
  here in australia it 's largely the rugby codes and afl , as well as cricket . 
  both countries have a strong history of good sportspeople , and in both soccer is considered a second-rate sport . 
  if that culture were to change , and the best sportspeople were aiming to be the best soccer players , then both of these countries would do significantly better on the world stage than they currently do . 
  for most countries , soccer is * the * sport to be good at . 
  in south america and south-east asia in particular , it 's almost ridiculous how little emphasis is put on any other sports . 
  and so those countries do well in soccer . 
  tl ; dr : if america took soccer seriously , it * would * dominate other countries . 
  yeah , the timing was only curious in the context of the recent crashcourse video . 
  it 's a generally understood fact about sportspeople . 
  look at how many famous sportspeople you 've heard of that are also good at a large number of other sports . 
  that 's not because those individuals were just so fantastic that they excelled at a bunch of sports , it 's because they were good sporty people , who then happened to pick one of those sports to specialise in . 
   liberal party is much better at slash and burn cuts to provide a surplus , that is for sure . 
  yeah , that 's basically what i was referring to . 
  i think you 'll find the people of this subreddit are n't going to fall for the blind and frankly largely unwarranted hate towards the new comment system . 
  for what it 's worth , i could say the same for / u/squalor . 
  who 's that ? 
  and to a lesser extent / u/slyfox00 , who i have at +5 in res . 
  i find it amusing that you used that terminology , considering i just saw unidan in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/1qsgdq/i_think_korra_looks_better_with_her_hair_down/ ) , about korra letting her hair down in the finale of legend of korra . 
  third culture kid problems . 
  slow down !, 
  i 'm still waiting for the search part 3 to hit torrents so i can find out what happened to zuko 's mother !, 
  ( and if anybody spoils it in the comments i will find you and i will cut your throat . ), 
  i think one of the biggest reasons that this is not true is that society and expectations put upon individuals have changed greatly since the time of common practice era music . 
  the way a man would be expected to behave and act in the late 1700s is so different from the way a man is expected to behave today that the modern male would have as much trouble understanding that context as the modern female . 
  by the way , i 'd encourage you to take this question over to / r/changemyview . 
  it feels like it could be a really good question for that subreddit . 
  ok let me start of by stating that i 'm saying this from an australian perspective , which is somewhat different from the us one , although it shares key details . 
  like the us , australia is a federation , where states are given power through the federal government to enact legislature . 
  the difference here is that the concept of `` states ' rights '' has never really taken hold , and i feel that this is a good thing . 
  even here , where states have much less power than they do in the us , there are massive problems with differences and incompatibility of the education system , road laws , alcohol and drug laws , etc. 
  these can cause some pretty serious issues if someone who has grown up in one area wants to ever move to another area , unless they go to the effort of reading up in detail all the differences in laws between the two states . 
  with a more powerful federal government , if someone moves to another state they do n't have to worry about being fined for doing something that was perfectly legal in their home state . 
  for example : in my state it is perfectly legal for a cyclist to ride on the footpath , but many other states do not have this law . 
  i so happen to know about it mainly because it came up in discussion , but were i not a frequent internetian , i would have never discovered that . 
  there 's a fairly high chance that i 'll live in another state at some point , and as an avid cyclist i would undoubtably have ridden on the footpath just * assuming * that it was legal , because it was back home . 
  and yet it is n't , so i face the risk of a fine , and at the very least an uncomfortable encounter with a police officer . 
  similarly , there are currently disparities in laws regarding prostitution , alcohol purchase and consumption , and even marijuana . 
  these would all result in much more serious problems if someone were to misunderstand the local law . 
  for children moving , it 's even worse . 
  if the educational system does n't match up , one student might have missed out on key information that was taught earlier in the state that they move to . 
  having missed this earlier on can have massive knock-on effects to their education , causing them to slip behind in their education . 
  there are studies documenting this effect , though i ca n't think of the appropriate key words to search for a source . 
  now , obviously this can happen even with an identical curriculum , because different schools take different approaches to things etc. , but at the very least we should attempt to minimise harm . 
  it also creates inefficiencies in areas such as fire , medicine , and police agencies , due to having ( likely ) a federal agency , as well as individual ones for each of the states , and probably many local ones as well . 
  leaving this at just a single federal one plus local ones is a great way to increase efficiency . 
  *** tl ; dr *** this is a bad idea because of : ** different laws ** , ** educational knock-on effects ** , and ** inefficiencies ** . 
  i would propose significantly minimising the power of state governments and widely increasing the power of both federal and local government . 
  i do n't understand how , logically , it makes sense to judge people better specifically for choosing to go into debt to pay for something rather than paying for it directly . 
  if someone 's been paying all their bills off in full every month with their debit card ( or , god forbid , cash !, 
  ) , why should they be penalised relative to someone who goes into debt on a monthly basis only to pay that debt back off anyway ? 
  one thing i never understood about the us system of gpa is that it 's a score of up to 4 that 's based on ... what , exactly ? 
  here in aus , my uni ( and i 'm pretty sure all unis do the same ) gives a gpa out of 7 . 
  but for every course you take , you 're also given a score out of 7 . 
  your gpa is literally the average of those scores ( weighting is sometimes taken into account for harder/later year courses , but it 's essentially the same thing ) . 
  my understanding is that classes in the us give grades on a lettered basis ( i.e. , a , b , c down to f ) , and that is somehow converted into a score for gpa . 
  you 're getting downvotes , but your entirely correct . 
  racism would be if it were insulting in any way , which it absolutely is n't . 
  the goto line would create a permanent loop of come , eat , like , come , eat , like . 
  do n't they have + s and - s , too ? 
  i could be wrong about that , though . 
  it 's mainly just from what i 've seen on tv . 
  again , i do n't if these + and - modifiers actually get used , it 's mainly from tv . 
  if you 're thirty and have never gotten a loan before , i 'd say that 's a pretty good indicator that you have good personal finance skills . 
  i 'd see that as a much better judge of someone 's ability to pay back the money . 
  ah right , thanks . 
  cheers . 
  yeah i came across that a while back , but did n't want to read the shitty version . 
  right after i posted that comment i went and looked for it again . 
  still not on torrents , surprisingly , but i did find a download version of the digital edition . 
  wow that was a good ending . 
  edit : [ i uploaded a torrent of it since there was n't one ] ( http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/9209920/avatar_-_the_last_airbender_-_the_search_part_3 ) . 
  never done that before , so i have no idea if it 'll work . 
  yeah he 's a shitty pm , but this is not a good indicator of that . 
  it 's quite an accurate , if somewhat unfortunately worded , description of what they face . 
  does it happen with all . dmg files , or just this one ? 
  if just this one , what was the source ? 
  ( their file may be corrupted . ), 
  have you tried redownloading it ? 
  ( it may have incorrectly downloaded . ), 
  the guy asking about public wifi was someone other than ludlam ...
