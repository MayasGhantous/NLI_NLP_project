  a school i went to when i was younger did pyp and the earlier years of myp before doing igcse and then ibdp . 
  i forget what my point was now after writing all of that ... 
  huh ? 
  i was just making fun of the apostrophe . 
  as someone who saw the word philosophy written on a website once , you guys are all wrong . 
  i 'm not sure why you would need a `` pre-ib '' programme . 
  the ibo already has something designed to go before ib . 
  it 's called the middle years programme , and it runs from roughly years 6 to 10 in a 12 year system . 
  what countries are you travelling in ? 
  i find it very fitting that this video is blocked where i am at the moment . 
  yeah , that happens a lot . 
  source : legend of korra did this three times in the latest season . 
  actually to be osmosis it is n't just movement of water across a gradient , it has to be * through a semi-permeable membrane * . 
  although for what it 's worth , according to the dictionary google uses , osmosis can also be `` the process of gradual or unconscious assimilation of ideas , knowledge , etc. 
  '' , so i guess its usage outside of the biological definition is n't entirely incorrect ... 
  a song of air and fire, 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ earth ^ ^ and ^ ^ water, 
  actually , according to amas i 've seen from ( australian ) prostitutes , they have * lower * rates of stds than the general population . 
  largely because of the strict regulations on the industry . 
  well people in call centres are basically whoring themselves out , metaphorically speaking . 
  ok . [ here 's one source i found ] ( http://eprints.qut.edu.au/18418/1/18418.pdf ) that says that for those involved in legal brothels ( i.e. , sex workers and customers ) there is no significant difference between lifetime rates of stis . 
  hmm fair enough . 
  the three pieces i submitted as my creation part of hl music received a total score of one point short of the maximum ( 29/30 , iirc ) . 
  you can see two of them [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfvcnlsco4o ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrxvs4jhu6c ) . 
  i can send you the scores for them if you like . 
  i have n't come across this before , and i really look forward to watching it . 
  however , schiff does have an incredible series of lectures on [ every single one of beethoven 's piano sonatas ] ( http://music.theguardian.com/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) that you can listen to . 
  i highly recommend them . 
  edit : please take beethoven very seriously . 
  very good composer . 
  you a guitarist or a drummer ? 
  i only ask because i ca n't think of any other instruments where handedness is an option . 
  my guess would be that you should go with what you primarily identify with as your handedness . 
  downvoted for an honest question ... that 's totally fair . 
  but no , not for reals . 
  the air date is completely unknown . 
   i am saying it is they are today to continue it is own existence . 
  it is old function of protecting the rights of exploited actors is long obsolete . 
  huh ? 
  was that computer print out a planned long term joke , or was there something else surrounding it ? 
  at least it was n't hamlet . 
  the last page of that is basically `` and then they all die '' . 
  a meme is any cultural phenomenon that spreads by virtue of people liking it and reproducing it . 
  sort of like the cultural equivalent of a gene . 
  that 's actually where the term comes from , by the way . 
  the use of the joke `` the cake is a lie '' whenever someone mentions cake is a meme . 
  no images involved , but still a meme . 
  same with `` arrow to the knee '' . 
  some verticals are also memes , for example horny harry . 
  i 'm glad it was . 
  i literally only just noticed it now , and would have missed it entirely otherwise . 
  i 'd say keep it stickied until a new mod post comes up . 
  i feel like it would have fit better if he had used the [ batman transition ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yic7iro9d6i ) , rather than the intro . 
  oh man , i loved that series !, 
  fun fact . 
  left handed pianos actually * are * a thing , albeit an extremely rare thing . 
  oh really ? 
  i did n't realise they made left handed horns !, 
  a perfect example of the [ baader-meinhof phenomenon ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/ ) !, 
  i agree with / u/contact _ lens_linux . 
  do n't rearrange your keys . 
  one of the biggest reasons for the typing improvements in my ( and that of many others i 've spoken to ) typing speed when i switched to dvorak was because of the fact that i no longer * ever * need to look at the keyboard to type . 
  since you 've got a mac , i would suggest switching to the `` dvorak - qwerty \u2318 '' keyboard layout . 
  it 'll let you use keyboard shortcuts the same as in qwerty , by automatically switching layouts while the command key is held down . 
  that way , common shortcuts like cut , copy , paste , undo , and save are all easily reachable with just your left hand , just like they are for a qwerty user . 
  very few people on reddit would deny the fact that rick rolling , nyan cat , `` arrow to the knee '' etc. 
  the term meme does n't have its roots in the internet , and its modern usage really is n't all that different from the one dawkins originally coined , although internet memes do differ somewhat in their usage and style from the broader quasi-biological meme that dawkins thought up . 
  that 's all well and good , but it 's a complete non sequitur . 
  the above comment thread was about how instead of giving a blanket cash bonus , they should be giving money that has strings attached such that it has to be spent on something to help the kid 's education . 
  private schooling vs. public did n't come into it . 
  i 'd rather like to see them hold 2 -- 3 seats in reps , too . 
  i want to get into doctor who , but ... i 'm a bit of a completionist when it comes to books and tv shows . 
  i watched the original doctor who when abc was showing it years ago , and if i 'm gon na get into doctor who , it 's gon na be hard for me to do without first trying to watch as much of the original show as is surviving first . 
  and that is a * lot * of stuff to watch ... 
  have n't seen the film . 
  do n't plan to . 
  i have n't heard anything good about it , so i can only imagine that if i did see it , it 'd be among the top of my list of worst adaptions -- along with `` tomorrow , when the war began '' , `` avatar '' , and `` eragon '' . 
  but man , i think reading the last few chapters of the last book in that series may be the first time i can ever remember tearing up at a book . 
  never got around to finishing his other series , the demonata . 
  aside from the fact that , as / u/rmeredit says , you kinda missed the point , i find it hard to believe that it 's easier to do on an iphone than it is on android . 
  android 's inherent nature of being far more customisable and extensible also brings with it the risk of being more vulnerable to attacks . 
  what 's that a reference to ? 
  oh wow , that was absolutely fucking cringeworthy . 
  still , i do n't think it 's fair to call that the response `` from the ` average ' australian '' . 
  these are people who have made the decision to `` like '' abbott 's facebook page . 
  * of course * they 're going to like his drivel . 
  [ serious ] you sure about that ? 
  what about people who are australian citizens but who live overseas , or non-australians living in australia temporarily , for example students who go there for uni . 
  genuine question , are these adjustments taken into account when calculating the `` population of australia '' ? 
  smart ops take the opportunity to clarify in the comments , and get both link and comment karma . 
  worse shit , really . 
  urgh i 'm sick of having this fucking conversation every time barbecue gets brought up . 
  ** no ** , what australians do * is n't * grilling , it 's barbecuing . 
  the word barbecue has a different meaning in australia than in the us , and that 's perfectly ok . that 's how languages work . 
  for what it 's worth , australia uses the word in the same way as most of the rest of the anglosphere -- england and nz both use it the way aus does . 
  yeah , i make a point of removing it . 
  fuck them for that bullshit . 
  as someone studying software engineering , can i just say , software engineering barely counts as engineering . 
  the [ translink ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lach.translink.activities&amp;hl=en ) app is absolutely indispensable if you plan to get around by public transport . 
  you 'll need an internet connection , though .
