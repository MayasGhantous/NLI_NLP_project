  \\* by literally i literally mean figuratively, 
  to be fair , to the english speaker that 's still a heap more polite than how the french order things . 
  `` je voudrais bla bla bla '' translates as `` i would like bla bla bla '' . 
  actually i believe they put the barriers up for liability reasons . 
  the steps on escalators are much higher than normal stairs , so people are more likely to trip . 
  it 's one of the best things about english , imo . 
  this is brilliant , but i imagine my mum would have just yelled at me to come take the call . 
  well , it 's not * that * insignificant . 
  supreme court of the united states has 34 characters in it , compared to scotus 's meagre 6 . 
  it 's still more annoying than it is useful , though . 
  gee thanks arsehole . 
  there i was thinking we were having a nice productive conversation and you get your army to come along and mass downvote me . 
  real mature . 
  yeah i 'm aware . 
  i was merely pointing out that to an english speaker , the literal translation of french sounds less polite than the literal translation of korean . 
  in each case it 's not considered impolite at all to a native speaker . 
  mmm fair enough . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of any of these sorts of subreddits . 
  all the \\ / r/badx ones linked in the sidebar , srs ( and its family ) , and other subreddits that exist solely to point like-minded people to threads disagreeing with that mind leave a bad taste in my mouth . 
  even if it is n't the original intention , it 's always going to lead to downvote brigading more than insightful conversation . 
  perhaps , then , the word erroneous is n't the best word to use ? 
  it implies that using those words is quite definitively * wrong * . 
  i have n't heard the words before , but just from the context i can gather in this thread , it seems that the words are correct , but derogatory . 
  rather than `` erroneously referred to as '' , would n't `` sometimes known by the derogatory terms '' be more appropriate ? 
  the pedant mentioned in the op here !, 
  you want some serious drama , check out / r/badlinguistics . 
  specifically [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/1rj82f/it_sounds_bad_and_makes_the_speaker_sound/ ) which was their take on the same conversation . 
  and in that thread , specifically the conversation between myself ( and the alt accounts i made after being banned , / u/zagorath0 and / u/zagorath1 ) and the mod / u/rusoved . 
  i 've also had a very ... interesting ... pm back and forth with the mod / u/rusoved and one other mod who was taking his side after i was banned from the subreddit . 
  personally ( as the ` pedant ' mentioned in the op ) i have n't got an issue with / u/grammatiker , he seems a mostly reasonable person . 
  the mods of / r/badlinguistics , on the other hand , are massive dicks . 
  is `` one '' not the correct word to use here ? 
  my story 's not as interesting as a lot of the ones in here , but it felt really weird at the time . 
  for context : every year , schools in my area got together at one of the schools for a week for a big collaborative music gala . 
  the year after i graduated highschool ( i 'm 18 at the time ) , my school was hosting . 
  because of university starting date differences between the north and south hemispheres , i was still around , so i helped out at rehearsals etc. 
  the actual story :, 
  one time during a break , i was messing around on the piano , and a young-ish girl ( probably around 13 -- 15 ) came up to me and said `` excuse me sir , do you know where [ one of the teachers ] is ? '', 
  it was such a weird moment for me , to be addressed as `` sir '' in that context ( as opposed to , say , contexts such as air stewards or restaurant waiters ) . 
  well shit , i 'm glad i do n't know you in real life ... i honestly do use the word `` one '' where it 's appropriate . 
  some of the time , at least . 
  sometimes it feels less natural . 
  not that it comes up too often , it 's not frequently that -- in everyday conversation -- you find yourself in the situation that `` one '' would be the correct word to use . 
  and yes , i used the impersonal `` you '' in this case . 
  it felt more natural . 
  as for it being `` stiff and formal '' . 
  well , i 'm sorry that you find correct usage of the english language to be that way . 
  it 's a much bigger part in cricket than most other sports , though . 
  because of how slow the sport is , the mental game plays a really important role . 
  i did n't know what `` running up the score '' was , so i looked it up . 
  according to wikipedia it 's bad sportsmanship in some sports to keep scoring a heap after you 've already clearly won , and a better alternative is to do things like kneel or give the ball away . 
  i must say i found that quite amusing , because those tactics would be seen very unsportsmanlike in rugby league or afl ( the two most popular football codes in australia ) . 
  with regards to cricket , for what it 's worth , the term does n't really make sense . 
  because of its nature , the result of the game is almost * never * not in doubt . 
  one team could be hundreds of runs ahead and the game still end in a draw ( not to be confused with a tie , which is a different thing altogether in cricket ) if the other team can stay in long enough . 
  edit : i also just remembered , in afl and the nrl , in the event two teams are tied for points on the ladder , the tie is settled using in-game point margins , so ` running up the score ' is highly advantageous . 
  oxford dictionary of english says :, 
   the simultaneous occurrence of events which appear significantly related but have no discernible causal connection, 
  so i guess you 're right . 
  i think it would be fair to just call it * inflation * . 
  what is fmd ? 
  google only returns results that do n't seem useful . 
   a huge majority of australias population live in pretty much 8 cities . 
  that 's actually an * understatement * . 
  you could get away with saying a huge majority live in pretty much [ five cities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_australia_by_population ) ( going by greater capital area ) . 
  heck , you get 50 % of the population with just three . 
   i 'm assuming it 's either at an obscure time of the day or only showing some ads-b flights . 
  not radar . 
  ( i 'm guessing that 's what the orange tracks are in the us and maybe the faa shares their radar feed whereas we do n't ? ), 
  i do n't know much about how these things work , but i 've spent a fair bit of time on this site , and you pretty much hit it spot on . 
  additionally , the us radar ones are on a delay . 
  i 'm pretty sure the ads-b flights are only those picked up by amateur enthusiasts who share their sensors with the site , too , so you 'd be missing some flights away from population centres . 
  yeah their members that i talked to seem fine . 
  it 's only the mods i take issue with . 
  and foxes make yipping sounds . 
  seriously , it 's not that hard . 
   cricket is confusing as fuck, 
  haha yeah . 
  to be honest , that 's a big part of what 's so great about it . 
  let 's be honest , watching a bunch of people stand in a field for 5 days is hardly exciting by itself . 
   draw and tie are n't the same thing wtf, 
  hahahaha . 
  yeah , it 's a little weird . 
  cricket 's complicated , so i 'll try and explain the bare minimum needed to get this . 
  test cricket matches last 5 days . 
  each team gets two innings ( i.e. , two chances of batting , and two chances to bowl/field ) . 
  in each batting innings , you get 10 ` wickets ' . 
  that means 10 players can get out before the end of the innings . 
  if all 4 innings have n't played out by the end of the fifth day , the game is a draw . 
  if team a gets 300 runs in their first innings , team b gets 100 , then team a gets 300 again in their second innings , but they ca n't get team b all out fast enough , then the game ends in a draw . 
  a tie only happens if the scores are identical and both teams have completed their innings . 
  as you can probably imagine , that 's not an easy thing to have happen , especially when the scores are in the order of hundreds of runs ( scored in lots of 1s and 2s mostly , with up to 6 off a single shot for hitting the ball over the boundary on the full ) . 
  ties are exceedingly rare -- i 'm pretty sure it 's only happened about twice . 
  other forms of cricket , like one day internationals and twenty20 cricket do n't have this particular complication , they work in a more simple manner . 
  the team with more points after a set number of overs wins . 
   in basketball and football the win/loss record is what matters in you 're ranking to advance to the playoffs so a win is a win is a win, 
  the way it works in nrl ( and i imagine afl is very similar ) is that if you win a match , you get 2 points on the ladder . 
  a draw gets 1 point each , and a loss gives none . 
  if two teams have won the same amount of matches , you need some sort of method to decide who is ahead on the ladder . 
  i imagine nfl and nba have their own method of doing this .
