  in nrl and afl it 's done by calculating win margins . 
  add up all the points they 've scored during matches , and subtract the number of points that have been scored against them . 
  they 're incredibly rude . 
  one mod in particular was massively abusing his power and doing so in a rude way , as you can see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/1rlb95/meta_can_i_please_remind_people_of_the_rules_as/ ) and even more so [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/1rj82f/it_sounds_bad_and_makes_the_speaker_sound/cdodha2?context=1 ) . 
  additionally , i engaged in a pm conversation with that same mod which was rude and quite actively showed that he did n't actually care to do his job of modding the subreddit :, 
    in particular , i was having a conversation with / u/grammatiker that can only continue via private message now , because of / u/rusoved 's abuse of power . 
   i refer you to my flair . 
    i 'm not going to lie , i do n't think the sub should exist . 
   complain somewhere else . 
    even so , i 'd be perfectly happy to leave you guys alone to do your thing if it were n't for the downvoting . 
    my biggest recommendation would be requiring np.reddit.com links , which would certainly slow down the downvotes from most people . 
   no , no one has the time to enforce that rule , and no . 
    bottom line is , banning someone right in the middle of a conversation purely as a way to end the conversation and appear the tough guy is a massive violation of reddiquette , and i do n't think someone like that should be the mod of any subreddit large enough to have a number of other mods . 
   you do realize that reddiquette is a bunch of guidelines that moderators are free to follow as they wish , and not a site-wide code-of-conduct , right ? 
  if you did n't , now you do . 
  kindly stop bothering us . 
  the other mod was passive-aggressively saying `` deal with it '' and `` shove off '' . 
  not rude , perhaps , but incredibly passive-aggressive . 
  to be quite frank , it came across as kinda pathetic . 
  you 're actively discouraging people from trying to have conversations that ' are n't wank-fests about how dumb other people 's grammar is . 
  note that this is somewhat devil 's advocate , somewhat trying to interpret what the above user said . 
  it does n't represent my actual views . 
  i believe he 's calling bitcoin a pyramid scheme because in order for the early buyers to make a return on their investment ( early mining or buying of bitcoins ) , they need to convince other people that bitcoin is valuable and get them to buy bitcoins , increasing the value of a bitcoin , and thus increasing the profit for early bitcoin holders . 
  i do n't suppose you know if/how i am likely to able to emulate [ dark cloud ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_cloud ) on a pc ? 
  i had that game as a kid and i absolutely loved it , but i could never beat the final boss . 
  it 'd be nice to go back and finish it after all this time . 
  on the one hand you 're technically right . 
  on the other , when studying a literary work ( which tv episodes most certainly are ) , it * does n't matter * what the author 's intentions were . 
  if there 's evidence in the work to support a theory , then that theory is a valid one . 
  in seriousness , people often use tl ; drs as a way of putting a humourous twist on the situation . 
  i 'm not sure how phrases like, 
   but i can guess why based on your posts, 
  and, 
   therefore your continued presence is detrimental to the purpose of the subreddit, 
  can be interpreted as anything * but * passive-aggressively trying to tell someone to shove off . 
  duuude ... 
  damn , what 's with the direction west being associated with shopping ? 
  here in australia west * field * shopping centres are one of the biggest groups . 
  damn , that 's actually a really good description of it . 
  not an american here , but :, 
   you ca n't have it both ways . 
  yes you can . 
  `` you '' ( being a collective group of millions of people ) can do pretty much whatever you want , language being an organic thing . 
  that said , i think their rule is basically `` if it ends in * ise * , change the s to a z ( oh , and while you 're at it , change zed to zee . 
  it rhymes better ) '' . 
  i do find it curious that they do n't differentiate between practice and practise ( or as it would probably become if they * did * differentiate , ' * practize * ' ) for noun and verb , though . 
  awesome , i 'll have to give it a go !, 
  is it weird that i * knew * you were going to talk about flux from the second line of your comment ? 
  but yeah , flux is amazing . 
   stop using final cut then you can get real time rendering, 
  final cut has real time rendering , though ... 
  it 's also a bloody amazing editor to work in . 
  i had no idea that they had a presence outside of australia and new zealand . 
  in addition to / u/jazzcigarettes ' comment , this is n't an amateur musician we 're talking about . 
  i would n't mind hearing a professional violinist practising any more than a professional pianist . 
  nobody reasonable would . 
  note , i 'm saying nobody reasonable would have * no * problem with them , just that they would n't have any * more * problem with a professional violinist than a professional pianist . 
  i 'm no where near pro , but for me , a good quality weighted keyboard has easily a good enough feel . 
  the problem is that it does n't have anything close to the correct * sound * . 
  this makes practising something with a lot of pedal particularly difficult . 
  yeah my point there was that if you do n't have a problem with piano , you * can not * have a problem with a good violinist . 
  if you do have a problem with any noise , that 's a different issue . 
   it might conceivably boost traffic to the food court , though, 
  could you explain this ? 
  i do n't get the reference . 
  cash-in hand-job, 
  ftfy, 
  i know right ? 
  i had never heard the term before , but it 's pretty obvious what it means . 
  wage packet . 
  a packet containing your wage . 
  dude you got some problems . 
  in the context of this particular comment thread , you stated :, 
   okay , fine ... i get you ... now imagine they are practicing violin ... i 'm sure you 've heard someone learning to play the violin . 
  can you imagine listening to that for hours on end each day , even at low volume ? 
   you sit down for a quiet cup of coffee to rest your head and think about your day and you suddenly hear a pig being slaughtered . 
  for two hours straight . 
  implying that because it 's a violin , it 's going to sound horrible to absolutely anybody . 
  personally , if you want my take on the original situation , i 'd say that during daylight hours ( let 's be generous to those that do n't like the practising and say from 9 till 5 ) they should be allowed practise , no matter how bad it sounds . 
  so long as the volume level is n't above reasonable levels -- say , the level of a loud action movie . 
  fair enough . 
  oh no i totally get it . 
  even i notice the difference enough that if i need to perform in a grand after having practised on my keyboard , i 'll need a few practises on the grand first . 
  i think i 'm even more confused after that comment than i was before it ... 
  if your aim is, 
   just get a cheap hut somewhere , and laze in a hammock for a month or so , reckon there must be somewhere we can do this for $ 20 a day . 
  then laos is the perfect pick . 
  the country 's really quiet and laid back . 
  it 's also one of the cheaper places you could go in sea . 
  fun fact that was true when i went there ( probably over five years ago now ) and may not still be true . 
  the entire country has just nine traffic lights . 
  when i was studying economics we were taught that the most important industries for the health of the economy ( in no particular order ) are education , healthcare , infrastructure , and banking . 
  that last one seems a bit out of place , and certainly is n't one that should be government organised in quite the same way , but it does make sense . 
  loans to fund business ventures are really important for growing small and medium businesses , which in turn is good for the economy . 
  so yeah , your statement about education , healthcare , and infrastructure was correct . 
  not sure about law enforcement though . 
  his point was that without subsidies they would still be able to exist just fine , only with slightly less profit . 
  saving the government money twice . 
  once for not paying the subsidy , and once for taking kids out of the public system . 
  i 'm not going to give my opinion on whether you or he is right , at least until i see data .
