  now , i do n't know all that much about psychology , but i was under the impression that although his actual theories are mostly bullshit , he is generally regarded as the father and/or grandfather of psychology . 
  that he came up with important methods of studying the mind that are still widely used today . 
  link to that thread ? 
  what 's the title and research question ? 
  it 's a combination of moving quickly ( which causes time to travel faster for others than it does for you ) and being higher in a gravitational field ( which causes time to travel slower for others than for you ) . 
  the two effects actually counteract each other . 
  unfortunately , though , they do n't counteract equally , so one of them has more of an effect than the other , which means that it has to be adjusted for time . 
  i do n't remember which has the greater effect , though . 
  according to a comment just a little a over yours in the thread , the logic is hardware based , not firmware . 
  sure it 's possible , but no civilian jet would ever get close to either extremes in normal operation . 
  ah cool , thanks . 
   it 's the * same * notes . 
  you just start in a different place . 
  that 's how the natural minor scale is built , too . 
  instead of starting at c , you start at a , and voil\u00e0 , minor scale . 
  ( harmonic and melodic minor scales do involve changing the notes a bit , but that 's a separate issue . ), 
  different modes just give the piece a different kind of mood . 
  most classical music choose to mainly use the major or minor modes ( aka ionian and aolean ) , but they all have their unique uses and moods . 
  this table :, 
  | mode | c | d | e | f | g | a | b | c |, 
  | ionian ( major ) | c | d | e | f | g | a | b | c |, 
  | aeolian ( natural minor ) | c | d | e \u266d | f | g | a \u266d | b \u266d | c |, 
  puts the modes in order from `` brightest '' sounding to `` darkest '' . 
  it always starts on the note c so you can clearly see the way the intervals change , which is what causes the change in mood . 
  each darker mode is essentially `` more flat '' than the one above it . 
  you 're going to need to be more specific . 
  that has a bunch of different processor and graphics cards that were options in the 2009 imacs . 
  your graphics card does n't meet the minimum requirements for windows . 
  i do n't know how the mac version was done , but in most cases the spec requirements for a game on mac are higher than on windows , due to shittily done wrappers . 
  for windows , at least , [ this site ] ( http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=1176&amp;game=bioshock%20infinite ) recommends at least a gt 340 or gtx 9800 . 
  edit : i pasted the wrong link before ... 
  no , it 's the same thing . 
  australia has the same issue . 
  if developers censor their game themselves , it 's to pre-emptively get around government classification laws . 
   just to get a lower rating and more sales, 
  that 's a different issue to what i was talking about . 
  the difference between an m rating and an r rating is a totally different dynamic than the difference between r and refused classification . 
  if a game is refused classification , the game is effectively banned . 
  the only way anyone can get the game is to go out of their way to get it from another country . 
  in australia , at least , this is technically also illegal but largely unenforced . 
  bringing the game through customs is illegal , although apart from one state the actual possession of the game itself is n't illegal . 
  for that reason , i do n't think games that have been self-censored in order to avoid an rc rating should be considered any different from games that are censored explicitly by the government . 
  if a game self-censors so it can get a lower rating , i agree , that 's not censorship . 
  i started school in ' 99 , and was always taught that pluto 's orbit puts it usually furthest of the 9 from the sun , but that there is a period where it 's closer than neptune is . 
  was never specifically taught that that occurred from '79 to ' 99 , though . 
  or to avoid the anti-gay people getting angry , two straight dudes at a barbie . 
  ( or whatever the us equivalent is . ), 
  that would definitely go over very well in australia . 
  / u/ilikeyoulikeme is correct . 
  it 's at exactly 5:58 , to be precise . 
   what do you expect to pay for a medium size popcorn ? 
  what 's medium size ? 
  people may have different perceptions of what entails medium . 
  same issue with currency . 
  i 'm assuming you mean us dollars , but canada , australia , nz , singapore , and many other countries also use a currency called the dollar , and the value of those dollars can vary significantly . 
  i thought barbecuing in america was a slower style of cooking , though , and i imagine that would n't be as accommodating for the social barbecue event . 
  i 'm pretty sure what you call grilling is what we usually call a barbecue . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  correction : food is * meant * to be burned at a barbie . 
  ( prices * ), 
  still leaves question of size , though , unless you intentionally left that up to the person taking it . 
  yeah i was more referring to the social event where you cook food on the barbie ( usually referred to as grilling in the us ) . 
  similarly , it does n't explain that imperial units are still fairly widely used in the uk . 
  miles per hour , feet & inches ( especially for height of a person ) , and stones & pounds ( primarily for the weight of a person ) . 
  oh man , i wish we called it that . 
  it makes it sound so ... dramatic !, 
  eh , i 'd agree with them . 
  i have always described avatar by saying `` it 's not a movie , it 's a tech demo . '', 
  the story i found to be incredibly lackluster , but its special effects and visuals were absolutely * incredible * , and it basically started the current trend of having good quality , non-gimmicky , 3d in movies . 
  the main reason i asked is because i was wondering if you were referring to james cameron 's avatar , or avatar : the last airbender , the latter of which ( referring to the movie ) was beyond lackluster in both story and visuals . 
  \\* edit : which it deserves to be highly praised for , it did an incredible job of that stuff , and i really like the idea of using 3d as an extra artistic tool in the cinematographer 's / director 's belt . 
  also to be fair , a * huge * part of what made the series great was depp 's quirkiness and odd mannerisms . 
  relavant username . 
  i thought the explanation about zuko 's mum in the search : part 3 was a really good one . 
  yeah , the term is absolutely ubiquitous in australia . 
  very good points . 
   after that they fucked up royally and made 3 turds in a row because they could n't figure out what the hell to do and just said `` fuck it , we have the brand name lets do whatever '' . 
  you feel this way about all of the sequels ? 
  i honestly really liked the second one , although i agree completely about the third and fourth films . 
  the rule in queensland , at least , is :, 
   only one passenger under 21 years of age ( excluding immediate family members ) may travel with you between 11pm on a day and 5am on the next day, 
  so there 's no curfew , the rule is just that you ca n't have a whole bunch of your underage mates cruising around town with you . 
  other rules include :, 
   you must not use your mobile phone while driving , including the hands-free functions and bluetooth accessories . 
   your passengers are banned from using mobile phones on the loudspeaker function . 
  and, 
   you are not allowed to drive high-powered ( performance ) vehicles . 
  ( they have a specific definition of high-powered [ here ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/licensing/getting-a-licence/getting-a-car-driver-licence/p1-and-p2-restrictions/high-powered-performance-vehicles.aspx ), 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/licensing/getting-a-licence/getting-a-car-driver-licence/p1-and-p2-restrictions.aspx ), 
  no strict curfew in queensland . 
  the rule for red p plates is `` only one passenger under 21 years of age ( excluding immediate family members ) may travel with you between 11pm on a day and 5am on the next day '' . 
  you keep your red ps for a full year , though . 
  yeah this is an australian thing . 
  the rules he described are specifically wa , but other states have similar rules ( many of the replies describe them ) . 
  you kidding ? 
  i was there over your last summer , and it seemed like * nobody * waits for the crossing light to go green . 
  i have n't been to india , but from what i 've heard , * waaay * worse than thailand . 
  also , from experience , vietnam is also worse . 
  ( but not as bad as what i 've heard about india . ), 
  it varies from country to country .
