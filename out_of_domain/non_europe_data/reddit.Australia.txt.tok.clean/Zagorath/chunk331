  the solution to that is a sliding minimum wage . 
  in australia 16 year olds make $ 7.74 minimum , and it slides up to $ 16 for a 20 year old , and $ 16.37 for anyone 21 and over . 
  now , i 'm not necessarily saying that those are the values you should take -- cost of living is higher in aus , so the necessary minimum wage is obviously going to be lower -- i 'd say a more reasonable level would be an adult minimum wage of ~ $ 13.50 . 
  but the main point is that having a minimum wage that slides like that is helpful . 
  this way , minimum wage * can * be equated to living wage , but if you 're younger you do n't necessarily get the full minimum wage . 
  yeah , until a few years ago google had a tiny patent portfolio compared to the monsters like samsung and apple . 
  for what it 's worth , though , although i think the behaviour of both those companies in regards to patents is despicable , i think it 's counter-productive to call them patent trolls . 
  that term should be reserved for the companies that buy up patents and litigate on them -- without having actual tech products themselves . 
  ah right , i did n't watch it too closely , thanks . 
  just so you know , res allows you to save a link along with the tag . 
  i recommend saving a permalink to the post that made you tag them , so you can easily find it if you come across them in the future . 
   also , i turned anyone who said `` uk '' into england , because only they would care, 
  you really should 've done the opposite ( and the same with scotland , wales , and northern ireland ) , but oh well . 
  sometimes i forget how far behind the us is . 
  it 's already firmly friday afternoon here , and i 'm 3 hours behind eastern australia . 
  ( 4 hours if you count daylight saving , but i 'm from queensland and we do n't go for that rubbish . ), 
  should n't be too hard to implement the option to switch between the two , right ? 
  just thought i 'd note that the `` stats '' area has `` songwriter '' , `` lyricist '' , and `` producer '' , but not `` composer '' , which is probably more appropriate if you 're sharing it in this community . 
  yeah i misread it at first . 
  was n't even surprised , that 's exactly the sort of thinking i 'd expect of the liberal party . 
  brunei is fairly boring , but i 'd rather be living there than many , many other non-muslim countries . 
  ( e.g. 
  china , israel , virtually all of africa ) . 
  same goes with indonesia . 
  that 's correct , but hardly pertinent . 
  could someone explain this ? 
  agree totally , a female assassin would be awesome to see . 
  we already know that they existed in their universe . 
  also , whether female or not , so much yes to a chinese assassin ( though for some reason it feels to me like a female would be the perfect fit if they go to china ) . 
  yeah that 's what i wanted from it , and with ac 1 , 2 , and broho they felt like they could be leading up to that -- especially with the end to broho . 
  revelations was interesting , learning the backstory to desmond in the outside-but-not-really of the animus bits , but ultimately felt more like an interlude than anything else . 
  i still have n't played ac3 , let alone 4 , but from what i 've seen -- not to mention how fast they came out after each other -- they seem to be a massive drop in terms of the quality of the overall story arc . 
  yeah , i meant in the main series . 
  yeah i meant in the main series of the game 's storyline . 
  oh right , thanks . 
  i do n't suppose you could explain what specifically a `` vampy shirt '' is ? 
  or libertarianism . 
  i do n't see it , but i 've been told many times , by both people that i know and complete strangers , that i look like '' ** harry potter ** '' ( in other words , ** daniel radcliff ** ) . 
  perhaps the best story was when a girl working at a movie theatre here in saigon pointed it out by going `` oooh , harry potter ! '', 
  is the gold rush still even going on ? 
  i do n't think i 've seen very many recently . 
  the numberphile channel on youtube has a great explanation of it . 
  i must admit i had the same sentiment as you at first , but seeing the video made me realise just how much better tau is for learning . 
  previously i could only do conversions between degrees and radians by rote memorisation ( 30 \u02da , 45 \u02da , 60 \u02da , 90 \u02da etc. 
  in particular ) . 
  after seeing this video i was completely convinced , and i 've started thinking in tau instead of pi , and i 've become much better at intuiting how to work in radians , as well as how to work out trigonometric calculations . 
  is that meant to look like something ? 
  all i see is a square ... 
  given the number of errors noted in the avatar extras ( see [ here ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/avatar_extras_%28book_one:_water%29#goofs ) for book 1 's errors , there are similar pages for books 2 and 3 ) , i find it hard to consider avatar extras canon . 
  the zutara one , in particular , is refuted with this comment :, 
   avatar extras for `` the avatar returns '' claims that zuko was originally going to be the love interest for katara , but in `` sozin 's comet : the final battle '' michael and bryan state that they never intended for zuko and katara to be together . 
  that 's true , we ca n't be certain who 's right without an explicit answer from brian or mike . 
  but what we can do is try to work out which source seems more credible . 
  i do n't know who created the avatar extras , but it is clear that there are errors in it ( scientific errors , misspelling names , and naming things incorrectly ) . 
  given that as far as i 'm aware avatar extras was n't personally written or overseen by mike and brian , i would take other pieces as canon over extras . 
  but if you have other evidence or clarification i 'd be really interested to see it . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=favupd_ijvy ), 
  these types of stories on 4chan always really impress me . 
  i felt really moved by it . 
  at the same time , is there any way it 's actually true ? 
  can you really track one specific member of your party ? 
  as far as i can tell the only way this could ever happen is if you only ever actually had one huskarl with you at * any * point in your entire career . 
  i 'll have you know that in the latest * federal * election queensland saw no seats ( or very , very few seats -- i forget ) fall to the liberals . 
  do n't blame us for this shit . 
  right , that was obvious . 
  but abbott ( the subject at hand ) has nothing to do with the state election . 
  that 's why i emphasised that i was talking about * federal * election , because your post seemed to be conflating the two . 
  there you go, 
  i absolutely love that piece . 
  it was one of my set pieces that i had to study for ib music ( the other being copland 's el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico , which is also excellent ) . 
  yeah , samsung does shit like this all the time . 
  they 're a massively shitty company , and they deserve any bad press they get . 
  [ here 's a video explaining two other shitty things samsung did ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  one of them was a story where they flew bloggers from india to an event in europe under the pretense that they would be , you know , bloggers . 
  but when they got there they were told that they had to act as ambassadors for samsung , working at their booth -- or else have their return flights cancelled and have to pay their own way back ( which they could not afford to do ) . 
  [ this article explains that story a bit more ] ( http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/ ) . 
  the other one is the one this video is mainly about , where the person in the video was invited to a samsung guest by a telco as their vip guest , and samsung went behind both the telco and the journo to cancel his invitation without any notification . 
  for context , what he says about halfway through about how people love him for his unbiased opinions is n't tooting his own horn at all , it is absolutely , completely , true . 
  he 's long been my go-to resource for phone and camera-related topics when i want high quality reviews that i can trust to be accurate and completely unbiased . 
  if he says something 's good , i know that i can trust that it is , indeed , a good product . 
  yeah that was poor design on his part . 
  i answered with the party i * would * support if i was in america . 
  ( note , `` support '' \u2260 `` would vote for '' . 
  i mostly closely align with the greens , but under america 's system i would be forced to vote for the democrats or my vote would be wasted . ), 
  and do n't forget that they basically fudge benchmark tests . 
  the only time slippery slope can be a correct argument is if you can absolutely prove each and every step on the way has a causal relationship . 
  because of the improbability of this in most cases , it is nearly only ever used in a fallacious way . 
  ouch , people are getting really butthurt about this . 
  of * course * google glass * can * be distracting . 
  ** any ** piece of technology can -- heck , other passengers can . 
  my state has laws about what passengers you can have in your car late at night for this reason ( [ no more than one passenger under 21 between 11pm and 5am -- excluding relatives -- if you are on your `` p plates '' ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/licensing/getting-a-licence/getting-a-car-driver-licence/p1-and-p2-restrictions.aspx ) ) . 
  but google glass does n't * have * to be distracting . 
  it 's all about how you use it . 
  for a smart user it 's going to be much less distracting . 
  a glance up to the top right of your vision to check directions is much easier and less distracting than looking at your phone , even if it 's mounted . 
  but if you 're stupid enough to use it to watch a movie or check your email while driving , yeah it 's going to be distracting . 
  yeah i forgot about that one . 
  remembered it later and posted it in a different comment somewhere . 
  i do n't recall ever seeing it on reddit , although that could just be because i do n't browse during peak us times . 
  here 's my take on it .
