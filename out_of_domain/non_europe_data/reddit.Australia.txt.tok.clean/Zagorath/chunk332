  there is * no * safe way to drink and drive . 
  there is * no * safe way to text and drive . 
  there * is * a safe way to use google glass while driving ( e.g. , for directions ) . 
  we should n't ban it because there are also bad ways of using it , when in fact it can be an improvement when used properly . 
  hmm ... 
  if it 's on the lower end of that i 'll probably have to get one . 
  or maybe wait for the second gen , since there 's usually a big jump in technology between first and second gen compared to second to third . 
  quickedit : when it 's released , do you ( or others ) expect it will be released worldwide relatively quickly , or will it remain us only for a long time ( 1 + years ) ? 
  cool , thanks . 
   they 're one of the biggest smartphone and electronic manufacturer in the world , and what did you achieve ? 
  that 's got nothing to do with anything . 
  they 've got a history of treating people poorly , and people should know that when making a decision of what product to buy . 
   all big companies do that . 
  i have n't heard if anything like this from other companies, 
   samsung is korean , not american, 
   the problem is about batteries ,, 
  no , the faulty battery is not the problem . 
  that was an anomaly and could have happened to anyone . 
  the * problem * here is the terrible way that samsung handled it when it happened , and the two stories i linked in my previous comment . 
   then go inform them . 
  what the fuck do you think my previous comment was * doing * ? 
   so do n't expect good american ethics like you 'd like to see . 
  you seem to be making the mistake if assuming i 'm american . 
   do n't expect people to be good all the time . 
  i do n't . 
  i do , however , expect companies to act in a way that is generally good , and more importantly to make up for it when they mess up . 
  if they do n't , then neither they nor you should be surprised that they gave criticism . 
   that 's what lawyers do . 
  it 's not a conspiracy . 
  it 's also called pr and image . 
  when you 're a big company , bad pr and bad image can quickly bring your company down if you let crusaders spread lies or misconceptions about a product like lithium batteries , while nobody really understand how it works . 
  i 'm confused as to how this is relevant . 
  bad pr causes problems for companies ? 
  no shit , that 's my whole damn point . 
  they should have handled this better to avoid the bad pr . 
   you buy a smartphone , which has so much concentrated science and technology into it , for less than $ 300 , you do n't get to complain if you do n't understand why it burned . 
  a ) what smartphones are you buying for under $ 300 ? 
  even the nexus 4 was n't that cheap . 
  subsidised prices are n't the same as buying a phone for low cost . 
  b ) yes , i do . 
  if i buy * any * product in a developed country i have a reasonable expectation that it is at the very least safe . 
  that 's the law . 
  even so , the fact that the phone caught fire is only tangentially related to the point i 'm trying to make here , but you keep trying to go back to it . 
   you smartphone burst into flame ? 
  any third world kid would die to have a smartphone for 10 min . 
  an appeal to emotion fallacy , and one that does n't even attempt to actually make any particular point . 
  i only ever heard of other companies doing it in response to samsung , but i could be wrong about that . 
  you do n't think actively going out to silence people from telling their experience is messing up ? 
   i do n't buy any smartphone , they 're useless expensive gadgets which are not that much useful for their price . 
  people buy it because it 's cool, 
  i 'm not going to lie , the only thing i took out of this was `` i 'm wan na sound cool for going against the general trend '' . 
  that 's all your opinion , and it may be true for your lifestyle , but you state it as if it is a general fact , and that is quite demonstrably false . 
  very well said . 
  i have n't heard anything that i trust that claims anything specific about facebook or the other companies ( either defending them or damning them ) , but i do know that while it is n't certain , security experts are fairly confident that google previously had their private ( unencrypted ) connections tapped , and that they have since secured these connections . 
  google , at the very least , is not wilfully giving up users ' information to the nsa or other orginisations . 
  chances are that 's true for other companies , too . 
   meaning : no audio and no forced-takeover of my screen without consent . 
  i 'd like to addend that : rolling your cursor over the ad ** does not constitute consent ** . 
  [ google most certainly has n't , either ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1garzb/steve_gibson_of_security_now_explains_prism_the/ ) . 
   they can secede at any time !, 
  if you 're referring to the clause in their state constitution that 's not quite true . 
  what they can actually do is split into five states . 
  cgpgrey has a great video about this , but i 'm on mobile so i ca n't link it . 
  because then you 're just stooping to the same level as criminals . 
   ingress ^ beta, 
  and they wo n't even be able to hide behind that tag for too much longer . 
  i suggest you read up on the milgram obedience experiment and rethink that statement . 
   just another experiment, 
  i 'm guessing you did n't actually do the research , then ? 
  the milgram experiments are the * defining * experiments in the area . 
  they showed that the vast majority of completely normal people would administer near-fatal electric shocks if assured by an authority figure that it was the right thing to do . 
   the nz flag is a purely nz issue . 
   armed conflicts are all world issues . 
  i do n't even ... 
  edit : i just got to the end . 
  that did not go well . 
  let me get this straight , you 're only allowed to discuss things which actually affect you , unless they are `` world issues '' , in which case go ahead . 
  i have n't played the first , but i absolutely loved this game ( played it on pc ) . 
  you could try the [ hour of code ] ( http://csedweek.org/ ) . 
  i have n't actually done it , so i do n't know what it entails , but google was promoting it on their new tab page up until today , so i suppose it must have some value . 
  personally i found coursera to be fairly useful as a learning tool . 
  they have a few courses that run fairly regularly on python that are worth trying . 
  [ here 's one ] ( https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython ) , and [ here 's another ] ( https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1 ) . 
  ouch , that hurts . 
  from what i 've heard , your transport company 's official site is terrible , too , right ? 
  at least translink journey planner on the desktop worked really well . 
  for anyone wondering , you can use the backslash as an `` escape '' character all through reddit . 
  \\*\\* for example , without the backslashes this would be bold ** . 
  check the source to see it as i wrote it . 
  but i swear , the way reddit treats numbered lists is absolutely hopeless . 
  it creates problems like this one more often than it solves anything . 
  now have you tagged as `` hides wally in his photos '' . 
  hmm is that a common problem ? 
  i have n't noticed * any * composers popping up too frequently on my local classical radio station . 
  you can take a look at their playlist yourself if you like [ here ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/ ) . 
  ( or listen live , region unrestricted . ), 
  i 'm a huge fan of his requiem , as well as his jupiter symphony and a few of his concertos ( in particular the horn ones and the clarinet one ) , but i have to say i agree with you for the majority of what i 've heard from mozart . 
  i have to be honest , i 'm not a huge fan of the piano concertos on the whole . 
  there are a bunch of amazing moments , but i just do n't like them as much as the other works listed . 
  in before beethoven was deaf .
