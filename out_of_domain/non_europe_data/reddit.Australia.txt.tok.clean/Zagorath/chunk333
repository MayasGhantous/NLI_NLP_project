  governments do have competition , at least if you 're in a democracy . 
  that 's the entire point . 
  unless you 're referring to the idea of getting rid of government completely , in which case good luck living in a world without high quality infrastructure , education , and medicine available to all . 
  gmail has a bunch of handy features like this . 
  my other favourite ones are [ do n't forget bob and got the wrong bob ? 
  ] ( http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/dont-forget-bob-and-got-wrong-bob.html ) , which help make sure you 're sending the message to the right people , and the message send delay mentioned further up the thread . 
   not a good doge meme, 
  well duh , that 's because there 's * no such thing * as a good doge meme . 
  australia , actually , but if you 're going to say that the us is shitty in these ways then you 've obviously never been to developing countries in south east asia or africa . 
  civilised society works because we have a set of laws that apply equally to everyone . 
  there 's no practical way that the ancap idea of having people choose a police force/court system that they agree with would work . 
  nevermind that there are bound to be circumstances when no compromise can be reached ( one party opposes death penalty and one supports it ) , what happens to people who ca n't afford to hire protectors ? 
  they get completely fucked over , that 's what . 
  yeah , i thought it was fairly clear i was being somewhat facetious ( although that was my actual opinion , at the same time ) . 
  my college uses it extensively for communication of college-related events . 
  it 's the primary form of electronic communication for my friends , many of whom live in different countries . 
  i hate facebook , i * really * wish everyone would just jump to google + , but i really ca n't just quit it . 
  because there are n't many people who `` rely '' on them and also hate them . 
  the people that hate them simply do n't use them . 
  it 's not very complicated . 
  i really do n't understand how the uk fucked the conversion up so badly . 
  i mean , sure they 've done a hell of a lot better than the us has , but compare to australia where * everything * is done in metric units now . 
  it 's * soo * much better . 
   primary form of electronic communication, 
   electronic, 
  also :, 
   many of whom live in different countries, 
  sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed . 
  nah but seriously , english speaking people deal with people of other nationalities `` butchering '' their language every day . 
  and you know what , it 's totally fine . 
  we understand what they 're saying , so communication works just fine . 
  just so it 's clear , i only used the word `` butchering '' because i was quoting you . 
  it 's not a word that i 'd ever use in this context normally . 
   if you are using facebook solely to keep in contact with people in different countries they are n't actually friends in the literal non facebook sense . 
  yeah , that 's total bullshit . 
  these are people that i went to school with for 5 years , and spoke to every single day for that time . 
  then , when we graduated , it being an international school , we all went off to different countries for uni . 
  so now the only way we can keep in touch is via some electronic communication . 
  facebook happens to be the one we use , but it could just as easily be some im client , a different social network ( google + , anyboby ? 
  ) , or even a private subreddit . 
  so here 's an idea . 
  do n't pretend to know somebody else 's situation and judge them for how they choose to communicate with their friends . 
  it makes you a prick . 
   we need a solution to the massive problem of people feeling like voting 3rd parties is `` throwing their vote away '', 
  you know what that solution is ? 
  preferential voting . 
  a lot of redditors probably most supported libertarian candidate gary johnson . 
  i 'm not going to get into why i think his politics are stupid , because that 's not relevant here , but many redditors do support that philosophy . 
  however , they will have voted for obama ( or his republican opponent ) because they knew johnson could never win , so voting for him would be throwing their vote away -- the spoiler effect . 
  i 've never gone in for that . 
  to me it 's always been reddit . 
  it 's a proper noun , and i do n't see any particular reason that it makes sense * not * to capitalise it . 
  ( on the other hand , i 'm happy with unconventional capitalisation in things like youtube and ipod , because there it helps clarify things . ), 
  when i was in year one , in 1999 , there were people in my class who could n't fit their powerpoint presentation onto a floppy . 
  what specifically are centimetres bad for ? 
  the main thing i 'm thinking of is telling someone how tall you are , and i definitely know that for me saying 159 cm is much more logical than saying `` about 5 foot 11 '' . 
  litres are the absolute perfect measurement for normal drinking purposes . 
  a standard glass is exactly a quarter of a litre , which is a very nice round number . 
  most water bottles you buy are 500 ml . 
  the tl ; dr of this is that saying `` imperial units are just so much easier '' is complete bullshit , just like if i were to say `` metric units are so much easier '' . 
  neither one is * inherently * easier for common applications , it 's all about what you 're used to . 
  however , metric * is * ** much ** easier for learning ( converting units etc. 
  ) , which puts it ahead . 
  well , to be precise it 's a resolution with 4096 pixels width ( i.e. , 4k pixels , using the standard 1k = 1024 that is used throughout technology ) . 
  though the term has been co-opted by some with smaller resolutions of only 3840 across . 
  exactly . 
  alright , awesome . 
  i 'm guessing that means that i can `` buy '' them ( for $ 0.00 ) today , but i do n't have to actually download them right now ? 
  that should still be possible in a few months time , or a year 's time , or more ? 
  only mistake i see is that you listen `` one hundred '' as just `` hundred '' which moves it quite a few places up from where it should be . 
  no you 're absolutely correct . 
  although i do n't think it 's usually written with a hyphen . 
  i notice , also , that he avoided the problem of the `` and '' in numbers over one hundred , for example `` one hundred and one '' , which some people prefer not to include . 
  actually what / u/pixlepix said * can * be proven . 
  all you 'd have to do is show that every possible permutation of one million digits exists somewhere in pi . 
  that is a * much * weaker conjecture than `` pi is a normal number '' . 
  actually , if you look at some of the other comments , they 're saying that we * have * proven that it 's irrational , which means we * do * know that it does n't repeat . 
  what is n't yet known is whether it 's a `` normal '' number or not , which is a number that contains every possible sequence of numbers within its digits . 
  but that does n't get to the heart of my comment . 
  i merely said that it is trivial to prove if pi contains every possible sequence of 1,000,000 digits -- if that is true . 
  if it is n't true , well , that 's much harder to disprove . 
  thanks !, 
  dunno why you would n't have just posted that link in the first place ( let 's be honest , the ` article ' that went along with it in the op was worthless ) , but cool job for sharing it here anyway . 
  were you following the last two tests against england ? 
  actually there 's no reason you could n't use a base 1 . 
  the number 10 in base 1 would be, 
  i guess my main point was that it 's going to be * very * tricky to lose the series from here . 
  england would have to win all 3 remaining tests . 
  with how strong our last two tests were , that does n't seem likely to me . 
  another win or draw seems more likely . 
  of course , they only need two wins to retain the ashes , but even that seems to me like something we can prevent . 
  one more win or two draws is all we need , after all . 
  haha no worries , ** awesome ** job you did with the trailer , by the way !, 
  i honestly did n't even realise the joke there until i saw [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1srpok/as_per_request_selfie_in_the_white_house_bathroom/ce0oban ) comment . 
  i just figured it was nothing more than your usual preaching * the good word * without a second meaning . 
  haha nah mate , i usually notice the joke , i just missed it this time . 
  but keep up the good work , either way . 
  that would be [ the worf effect ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/theworfeffect ) [ warning , do not click that link if you have anything to do in the next hour ] . 
  i love sentences within brackets that you want to end with an emoticon . 
  there 's literally no way of making them look acceptable , so you end up with this weird amalgamation of brackets .
