  and that 's not to mention the linux one which apparently requires you use the terminal . 
  i think after the switch ( if indeed they do make the switch ) i might have to only download torrents on my mac , just because i ca n't be arsed to go through the process of installing it on my other machines . 
  unfortunately the existing pb browser is windows only ( another big flaw ... ) . 
  my windows machine is a desktop , and i 'm away from home with my mac laptop . 
  so i ca n't check . 
  but i suspect it does . 
  it is , after all , their main source of income . 
   saying that the bass is important is probably true for all music 1700 -- 2013, 
  ftfy, 
  true , but the popular music of the time ( jazz , rock 'n' roll , etc. ), 
  do fit that mould . 
  no , but the price difference is very significant , and the quality/reliability of the cheaper ones is going to be just as good . 
  could you elaborate on the `` may have been due to a cultural difference '' ? 
  i 'm curious about that . 
   it seems the education focuses on memorization, 
  yeah . 
  i actually went to school in korea for a little while . 
  mind you , i was at an international school , so i did n't actually go through the korean school system , but you still definitely notice that koreans really do have that kind of attitude . 
  i 'm curious , what was your line of work that you ended up in korea ? 
  \\ [ ] ( / s `` this will be hidden '' ), 
  why ? 
   we did not do criminal background checks, 
   we generally google searched most students anyway, 
  huh ? 
  he 's not right about australian censorship . 
  he was n't talking about game censorship , but internet filtering/censorship . 
  it was proposed a few years ago , but got dropped * and never implemented * . 
  australia does * not * have internet filtering . 
   prohibition , anyone ? 
  no thank you . 
  [ even more pedantic comment about how `` average '' \u2260 `` mean '' . ], 
  mean , median , and even mode , in some cases , are all types of `` average '' . 
  you 're not really correcting him there . 
  his comment specifically said, 
   they 're doing a few things right, 
  the point of his comment was simply that although us unis are doing things right , looking at international rankings is * not * a good indication of this . 
  huh ? 
  i was n't trying to mark it as a spoiler , i was asking why the guy i replied to decided to include the, 
  [ ] ( / s `` this will be hidden '' ), 
  in his comment . 
  i 'm a little confused as to the downvotes , to be quite honest . 
  res puts a little ^ [ 1 ] next to any link . 
  because of how they work , spoiler tags are seen as links by res . 
  i noticed it because of that 1 in square brackets , and clicked source to see what was up . 
  i guess i assumed most other people would 've done something similar , especially after reading my comment . 
  yeah , it 's always seemed odd to me that americans would say `` go to the bathroom '' out at a restaurant or what have you . 
  a place where there * is n't any bath * . 
  while we 're in a thread about this . 
  where would people recommend for buying computer * parts * ? 
  for building/upgrading a desktop system . 
  youtube 's content flagging is utterly horrendous . 
  there 's no two ways about it . 
  it 's so bad i really ca n't be bothered explaining all my gripes with it or i 'd be here all day . 
  their ui redesigns are largely unnecessary and arbitrary . 
  that said , i actually liked their recent update . 
  it meant that if you click on one video in your `` subscriptions '' feed , then you could click on other videos straight from the watch page using that new bar on the left . 
  sure it was a few extra clicks to get to your subscriptions box to start with , but once you did that it made things much more convenient . 
  unfortunately , now they 've taken that ability out , which i think is just stupid . 
  the comment system is great . 
  people like to bitch and moan about `` using their real name '' . 
  heck , people even complained about the new * useful * features like being able to type long comments , and share links . 
  going back to the real name thing , i for one have noticed a dramatic increase in the quality of comments since the change . 
  to what degree that 's a result of real names ( versus the other factors like being able to rank comments with votes \u00e0 la reddit , or due to the new , stronger , comment moderation tools ) is debatable , but it 's certainly a factor . 
  to be honest , i think the overall reaction was just asinine . 
  stream reliability has gone way done lately . 
  such a shame , they used to be literally the * only * site where you could reliably watch video . 
  i think they changed it to save bandwidth : people would load whole videos and then not watch them . 
  kinda shitty of them for changing it , though . 
   oh , i have n't played skyrim yet even though it 's been out for over a year and i 'm a gamer, 
  in the case you gave , sure , it 's probably accurate to call it a `` ridiculous '' excuse . 
  but / r/patientgamers is a thing , and many people ( whether they 're on reddit/subscribe to that subreddit or not ) subscribe to its philosophy . 
  fwiw it works on both the nexus 4 and the old nexus 7 . 
  ( or at least , it 's ` compatible ' with them . 
  i have n't actually tried it out since i 'm not in australia at the moment . ), 
  i had a vegemite and butter sandwich for lunch today . 
  and i 'm not even in australia right now . 
  in going to go ahead and assume this is an example of poe 's law . 
  because you are literally espousing every argument that the rest of this thread was laughing about , but you seem to be serious about it . 
  i want to see this as a fusion between what it is now and the college humor dora film starring ariel winter . 
  exactly this . 
  microsoft 's entire scroogled campaign is utterly asinine . 
  not only do they pick on targets with very little serious problems with them , nearly everything they complain about * they are also guilty of * . 
  oh god . 
  so , what you 're saying is your comment was indeed completely serious . 
  yeah , not like it 's responsible for [ most important australian inventions since it was founded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_australian_inventions ) . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
   if you have `` automatic allocation '' selected , then each time you level up , a point is automatically allocated towards whichever attribute you have focused on the most ( instead of manually [ + ] - ing a button ) . 
  this is determined by your tasks , using this algorithm, 
  and then nothing . 
  do n't suppose anyone knows what the algorithm is , eh ? 
  i checked the source and it 's definitely not something like an image that failed to load . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by rotk and green jelly , but now i 'm hungry for jelly and ice-cream ... 
  it 's already the 18th in east coast usa . 
  heck , of the contiguous states , only the west coast * is n't * the 18th . 
  when you have formatting like this , it means if you want to \\* surround some text with asterisks * it is impossible , because it becomes formatted ( on reddit , italic , on g + , bold . 
  so it becomes necessary to have an escape character . 
  something that will allow you to tell it `` i 'm not using this because i want bold , i 'm using it because i want to put asterisks around my text '' . 
  that 's where the \\ ( backslash ) comes in . 
  if you view the source for this comment , you 'll see that by putting, 
  \\* surround some text with asterisks *,
