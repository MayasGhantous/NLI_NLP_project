  i can turn the asterisk into an actual visible character . 
  i want to know if anyone knows a way to do this on g + . 
  i have to say , i * strongly * disagree with you here . 
  i do n't know you , and i do n't watch your videos , but now that i 've heard this i can confidently say i never would . 
  the comments are absolutely essential for building a sense of community . 
  someone further up the comment thread mentioned boogie2988 . 
  have a look at his comments , and see how well he uses them to get his followers to feel like a community built around the shared experience of watching his videos and learning about his life and thoughts , rather than a bunch of people who happen to watch some fat dude 's videos . 
  do you not consider a sense of community important ? 
  can i just say , i really like the new comment system . 
  but i 've been complaining as loudly as i can about content id for a long time now , and these changes are most certainly not in the right direction . 
  listening to music , for me , is usually a rather personal thing , although when i find something new that i like i 'll usually share it with people . 
  movies and tv are * all about sharing * . 
  some shows i know my friends also watch , and we 'll discuss the episode . 
  i also subscribe to the subreddits of many shows just for that purpose . 
  being able to discuss the show with other fans helps create a sense of community . 
  community does n't necessarily increase enjoyment of the material itself per se , but it certainly makes the overall experience much better . 
  you 're making the same argument he did earlier regarding doctor who . 
  sure the characters are attractive , but that 's hardly a * driving force * behind the show . 
  the show would work equally well with less attractive actors . 
  by the way , what does it mean for the casting to ` scream `` cw '' ' ? 
  i 'm not american so i 've never heard of them before this show . 
  maybe so , but that does n't mean he has to * actively * go out of his way to allow other people to create a community . 
  it uses the symbol for dong as its currency symbol ? 
  dogecoin uses the symbol for dong as its currency symbol ? 
  nah , i doubt it . 
  i know it 's not a popular opinion to like youtube 's comment section . 
  criticising the op in an ama is also not popular under most circumstances . 
  nothing fishy , just reddit being reactionary . 
  thanks for the concern/notification , though . 
  making the actual chatterbox is really , really easy . 
  it 's a really simple bit of origami that you can easily find instructions to online . 
  the drawing might be a little harder , though . 
  you can write ** longer comments ** . 
  it means you can have actual conversations with people . 
  ** inline replies ** . 
  means you do n't have to have the exact * same * conversation with multiple people , because you say something , they respond to it ( usually multiple people responding in the same way ) , and then you have to respond to each person individually . 
  ** links ** . 
  allows you to link to any relevant information . 
  this next point was one that did n't work to well initially , but over time either youtubers have gotten better at utilising it or youtube fixed problems in their algorithm :, 
  ** comment sorting ** . 
  previously it was just `` two top comments '' and `` two randomly selected uploader comments '' at the top , and then the rest reverse chronologically . 
  now it seems to put the best comments at the top , taking into account votes and who ( uploader ? 
  ) / how many replied to the comment . 
  additionally , uploaders now have more ** moderation tools ** at their disposal , which is really handy . 
  additionally , by having people use their ** real names ** , they are now much less likely to play the anonymous troll . 
  all in all , i 've noticed comments on youtube have significantly increased in quality since the change . 
  also from brissie , i have keys for bath , uk . 
  honestly apart from the first few days , i have n't seen links being abused at all . 
  and yeah , names are really easy to fake . 
  many people do n't even use something that * looks * like a real name . 
  that one was definitely the weakest of the points i made . 
  well , duh ... you then use that tax money for things like better subsidised/free healthcare , education , and social safety nets like the dole . 
  i particularly liked the second point b , because it 's one that far too many people would ignore or forget . 
  it 's a bit more like if scientologists hated hubbard in a hypothetical situation in which hubbard also started a rival cult . 
  since gates popularised the pc , but his company was also responsible for the xbox . 
  you might come across like a dick sometimes , and your beliefs may or may not be similar to mine ( i do n't know , i did n't look ) , but from this comment it seems plain to me that you are a generally nice person . 
   it really is n't that involved to type umlauts on most common us/uk keymaps . 
  please explain how . 
  it * is * really easy on os x , but the only way i know on windows is to memorise heaps of alt codes . 
   a transliteration as `` handle '' would have been much closer to the german `` h\u00e4ndel '' . 
  huh ? 
  you keep saying this , but handle * is * exactly how it 's usually said in english . 
  i do n't think i know anyone who says it differently . 
   what did happen in this case though is that the letter '' \u00e4 '' ( i.e. 
  [ \u025b\u02d0 ] ) was simply written as `` a '' which is pronounced quite differently , namely [ a\u02d0 ] . 
  it is a common phenomenon between german and english and really quite sad as it unnecessarily changes the way the name is pronounced because native english speakers can pronounce the equivalent `` handle '' just fine . 
  i must apologise , i 'm not familiar with ipa for german , and the [ wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_german ) is n't helping . 
  it says that \u025b\u02d0 is similar to the english word `` says '' , but i would say that in english with \u025b ( i.e. , ses ) . 
  a\u02d0 , which i gather is like bra , but with a shortened vowel , just sounds weird and falsely pretentious when applied to handle 's name . 
   infinite characters, 
  a good thing, 
   links, 
  a very good thing, 
   more replied comments getting pushed to the top ( often troll comments ), 
  has since been fixed . 
   ascii art, 
  people ( as predicted ) , got bored of this after a few days . 
  it 's relatively trivial if the instrumentation is the same . 
  you can command/ctrl a to select all , copy , and paste to the end of the previous movement . 
  to get it on its own page you only need to use the page break feature . 
  it 's on the layout menu . 
  we were discussing the things that governments could spend extra tax money on if taxes were raised on the obscenely rich , not debating the merits of current american foreign policy and drug laws . 
  right , but the point here is discussing what we think they should do . 
  things that they should n't do that they are currently is an unrelated point . 
   are you some kind of youtube employe ? 
  haha no , but i wish i was . 
   larger messages is a good thing but not if its bloody infinite, 
  no , you 're right . 
  reddit has a limit of 10,000 , and i 've only once ran up against that limit . 
  i think in general that 's a good amount . 
  the issue here is that youtube now uses google + 's comment system , and because google + is used as a blogging platform by some , it * does * need unlimited characters . 
  i 'm sure google could limit the length on youtube specifically if they wanted to , and they should . 
  however , unlimited is a huge amount better than the old limit of just 500 characters . 
   how are links good in any way ? 
  how are links good on reddit ? 
  or facebook ? 
  or any site ? 
  this is just asinine . 
  links are good because they mean you can send people links to content that 's relevant to the discussion . 
   the only thing they will be used for is scams and virus !,
