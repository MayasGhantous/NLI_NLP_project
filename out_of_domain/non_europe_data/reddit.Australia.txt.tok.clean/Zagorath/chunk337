  a hypothetical argument that has n't been true in my experience . 
  i saw a few spam links in the first few days , but since then they 've only been used for good . 
   people still can abuse it, 
  but they do n't !, 
  that 's the point . 
  and when they do , they get their comments removed or downvoted so they do n't get seen . 
  just like a government should n't be legislating based on what 's * possible * ( it 's `` possible '' to share child porn on the internet !, 
  ) , google should n't be nerfing their technology just because some small minority of people choose to abuse it . 
   really seems like your grasping at straws here, 
  seems to me more like you are . 
  holy shit what the fuck 2k games . 
  bioshock infinite is * double * the price in aus of the us . 
  glad i got all three for $ 15 when they were on sale on amazon a few weeks back . 
  side note , this is the second time i 've noticed [ fucked up pricing ] ( http://imgur.com/jkgssqx ) . 
  the last time was with civ , where i could get the gold upgrade edition for $ 5 , or get the gods and kings expansion by itself ( it was included in the gold edition ) for like $ 19 . 
  edit : while i 'm ranting : mac editions of the first two bioshock games exist . 
  why are they not on steam ? 
  editedit : added the word `` ranting '' , which seemed to get left out originally ... 
  the guy 's whining to get views . 
  too fucking bad . 
  either that , or he really means it , and it 's because he does n't care about conversation . 
  again , too fucking bad . 
  like i said , it was bad at first , but it improved very quickly . 
  i do n't know why it got better , but it did . 
  i suspect part of it is google fixing their algorithm , but also because people have come around to realising it 's a bad idea and have stopped doing it or have started downvoting when they have seen it . 
  read the comments of the very video you sent to me . 
  86themadhatter and sahil chauhan were particularly good . 
  this cube guy seems like a whiney bitch , to be honest . 
  i had never heard of him before , and quite frankly i wish it would go back to that way . 
  what 's with the random picture in the bottom right corner ? 
   / \u025b / is more like `` bed '', 
  exactly . 
  that 's exactly how i say `` says '' . 
  it 's * not * how i say `` handel '' , but the reason i brought it up was because it gives me reason to mistrust the ipa 's applicability in this instance . 
  the person i replied to implies that the english pronunciation of his name has changed to / a\u02d0 / , which is similar to the a in `` bra '' . 
  my experience has certainly * not * been that this is true . 
  i would pronounce handel exactly the same as i pronounce handle as in `` broom handle '' . 
  this is the same for all the english speakers that i know and have heard say his name . 
  well , since it 's german in this case you 'd be better off setting it to qwertz . 
  honestly , when i was learning french , this is what i did on windows computers . 
  i learnt a quick keyboard shortcut to toggle between dvorak * ( which i use when writing english ) to azerty . 
  i 'd toggle to write the letters with accents , then toggle back for most of the sentence . 
  \\* not to be confused with the composer anton\u00edn dvo\u0159\u00e1k . 
  yes , they should increase the taxes on the super wealthy . 
  and then they should spend that money for good . 
  the majority of what governments do are good . 
  that they also spend money on things like wars and pointless enforcement of dumb laws is something that needs to be changed , but it should n't prevent us from also asking that they help improve the overall economic situation of the country in the way described above . 
  it saddens me that people always call our number system `` arabic '' . 
  they 're more properly known as hindu-arabic , because of the influence both cultures had over them . 
  ok . all the negatives in this sentence are confusing me , but i think, 
   i 'm not so sure most people would n't have enjoyed a real performance, 
  is saying that you think most people probably * would * enjoy a real performance . 
  you also seem to be saying it as if trying to correct the person above you . 
  i 'd just like to point out that, 
   if they had just performed it normally , the majority of people would have enjoyed it, 
  in the comment you replied to seems to be saying the same thing . 
  most people probably would enjoy it . 
  ok from the look of it , those are period oboes . 
  i only got a brief look at it , but it seemed to be a modern bassoon . 
  has the bassoon changed that little in the time , or did they mix modern and period instruments ? 
  the technical musical term is `` melismas '' . 
  in this case , they were melismas in semiquavers that went on for many bars . 
  ok , i googled `` melisma '' to double check i had the right word , and one of the top results was [ this one ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17039208 ) , the first sentence of which is :, 
   whitney houston will be remembered as a master of `` melisma '' . 
  now , i 'm not familiar with her music , but from your comment i suspect you 'll strongly disagree with that statement . 
   let 's be honest with our language, 
  ok then . 
  let 's . 
  let 's not pretend that taxes are identical to forcing someone to hand over your money at gunpoint , as certain political/economical extremists are wont to do . 
  i 'm a westerner , from a country that would usually be considered `` western '' ( despite its geographic location ) . 
  when i was growing up , i was actually taught `` hindu-arabic '' . 
  i 'm not sure why this is n't more common in today 's society , to be honest . 
  i was actually surprised the first time i realised that this * was n't * ubiquitous . 
  no he 's right there . 
  the term `` liberal '' is generally used to refer to right-wing economics . 
  the `` liberal '' party in australia is our equivalent to the republican party in the us ( although arguably they are left of the democrats economically ) . 
  the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) is a great resource if you want more . 
  yeah sure , i was n't meaning to imply that they say something that they do n't actually mean . 
  i just meant to imply that the argument is completely without merit . 
  because it is . 
  actually , the very best defence against cryptolocker is a robust backup scheme . 
  even if you do get infected , just restore to a backup from * before * you were infected , et voil\u00e0 . 
  just make sure that the backup ca n't become infected either , by keeping it off site . 
  something like carbonite or backblaze is brilliant for this purpose . 
  other people have done excellent jobs of describing the general theory . 
  i 'm going to go ahead and attempt to change your view about australia specifically . 
  the liberal party and the murdoch press did a * fantastic * job of portraying everything done by labor in the last 6 years as hopeless and inept . 
  but it is , quite frankly , all based on lies . 
  the school halls thing ? 
  not one of the * best * they 've ever done , but certainly a * very * good thing . 
  in economics it is generally agreed that a government should save money when the economy is going strongly , and then spend it when the economy is in bust . 
  the idea is that you can help the economy by increasing the amount of money flowing around the economy by giving it a sort of kick start . 
  saving during strong times helps decrease the rapid growth , which could lead to inflation , and also lets you have money to spend during the bust times . 
  the `` school halls '' thing was mischaracterised as being spending on fancy unnecessary buildings . 
  that was n't really the case . 
  it was also largely about important school infrastructure like better science labs , language centres , and sporting facilities . 
  the bulk of the money ( $ 14.2 b out of $ 16.2 b ) went towards improving libraries , classrooms , and , yes , the infamous school halls . 
  education is one of the most important parts of the economy in the long run . 
  without a good education system , the kinds of things people are capable of are much less . 
  you need smart people to be engineers , doctors , lawyers , accountants/anything in finance , and most importantly the innovators and entrepreneurs that keep the economy going .
