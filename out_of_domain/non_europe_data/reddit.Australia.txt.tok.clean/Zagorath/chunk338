  but even aside from that , the school halls programme had direct , short term , benefit . 
  it created a lot of jobs in a time where they were needed . 
  those people now have money to live comfortably , and spend elsewhere and grow the economy . 
  oh , and you seem to be under the impression that labor has been increasing taxes . 
  [ they have n't . 
  ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-21/rudd-tax-to-gdp-ratio/4892178 ) in fact , taxes under the recent labor government were lower than they were under howard . 
  because of the global financial crisis , this was the smart thing to do , as described above . 
  lower taxes mean people can spend more , which helps stimulate the economy . 
  you also describe dysfunctional economic management . 
  australia was one of the * only * western , developed , economies to * not ever * go into recession during the latest financial crisis . 
  that sounds to me like * very * good economic management . 
  you might claim that it was because of the money saved during the howard era , but listen closely every time abbott brings this up . 
  it was a meagre $ 70 billion . 
  that might sound like a lot , but even in australia 's relatively small economy ( compared to many european powers or the us ) , it really is n't . 
  government spending * each year * , even during howard years , was nearly 4 times that . 
  so it 's not as if howard had this massive coffer saved up that labor then went and lost . 
  no , he had a small amount of savings , and labor spent them to prevent the economy collapsing , and to spur future growth . 
  ah right , i was n't aware . 
  thanks . 
  as i mentioned , i got all three games on the amazon sale a little while back , which is authenticated through steam . 
  i 'll just have to wait until i get my pc back from repairs ... 
  regarding the app store , i would say you 're right . 
  it 's probably largely to do with their `` you ca n't offer cheaper prices to others than you do to us '' policy , as well as the 30 % cut they take . 
  but they 're never going to see it take off in a big way unless they can entice more developers to also offer games through their service . 
   in the us , it 's only because of government regulation that asbestos is being removed , now that we know it 's dangerous, 
  this is also the case , to my knowledge , in australia . 
  i 'm not really sure what he was on about there . 
  no worries . 
  we all do it from time to time . 
  my impression of ny was that it 's massive in population , but really densely populated . 
  cheers, 
  how is this beta ? 
  i 'm honestly not sure how it 's really all that different from a certain space-cowboy 's famous `` i know '' , except with a more negative connotation . 
  not at all . 
  in fact , he just perfectly described introverts , without getting into the actual energy stuff . 
  introverts get drained by social activity , so they want to make what social activity they * do * have more worthwhile . 
  and what better way to do this than by avoiding them and staying out of them when it 's not a conversation you want to be in . 
  if you skip to 3:09 , that 's probably the bit where the `` happy birthday '' theme is the clearest . 
  and yeah , it is kinda in the style of clair de lune more so than debussy . 
  still , it 's a lot better than what some out there do , where it would n't be so much `` happy birthday in the same style as clair de lune '' as a very blatant and ugly `` clair de lune modified to also be happy birthday at the same time '' . 
  still , for this kind of thing , i really like [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq8lej6xlbi ) . 
  the hand switching thing is a very uniquely american thing , to my knowledge , and would be considered very poor etiquette elsewhere in a formal setting , and would just be considered kinda strange in a normal setting . 
  generally the ` norm ' would be for a lefty to have the knife in the left hand , and the fork in the right . 
  the knife normally goes in the dominant hand . 
  i was always taught that the `` right '' way is knife in the * dominant * hand , which just happens to be right hand for the majority of the population , but for a lefty would be knife in the left hand . 
  either way , it 's not the only time lefties have an advantage . 
  in most pop music , lefty guitarists have an advantage . 
  the right hand does n't do much that 's complicated , but the left hand needs to worry about chords . 
  for more complex music this does n't hold : the right hand needs to be accurate in plucking individual strings etc. 
  yeah , when i said that , i was thinking of [ one very specific person 's performances ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s75gyhods0m&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) . 
  the labor party most certainly * is * dysfunctional . 
  all the leadership changes and in fighting can hardly be justified as rational . 
  i agree with you , if anyone tries to justify that the labor party is n't dysfunctional -- or at least the way they were over the past six years , there has n't been enough time yet to say if they 've changed out not -- is just kidding themselves . 
  but from an actual policy standpoint , they 've been doing an excellent job . 
  they passed hundreds of pieces of legislation for the betterment of australia as a whole . 
  i 'm sorry if you ca n't see that , but it absolutely is true . 
  things like the ndis , the gonski report , a carbon trading scheme , and the nbn were all important investments in australia 's future . 
  i can go into greater detail in any of those if you doubt that they really were beneficial , just say so . 
  and they did all this despite the liberal party 's only real platform being `` whatever labor wants is bad '' . 
  unfortunately , so far this has * still * been the liberal party 's main platform , even though they are now in government . 
  as for the financial crisis being an american and european thing ? 
  definitely not . 
  i lived in asia throughout it and there was most certainly a noticeable downturn that they are still recovering from . 
  not as severe as the us and europe , but certainly still there . 
  it 's easy to pose hypotheticals and claim that it was because of chinese demand for our minerals that we never went into recession . 
  and doubtless that is true . 
  however , it certainly is n't possible to claim with absolute certainty that the labor government 's management had nothing to do with it , and it 's absolutely impossible to make a reasonable claim that they made it * worse * . 
  banking restrictions ( which had been in place for a long time ) and well targeted stimulus were also big positive contributing factors . 
  it actually is low . 
  you have to look at it as a percentage of overall gdp . 
  do that , and compare australia 's position with that of the us or major european powers . 
  my answer for this would be, 
  edit : which , amusingly , i just realised is in the related articles on the page op linked . 
  i ca n't speak for op , but http://en.wikipedia.org/wp:lame is always a fun read . 
  i do n't remember runescape having pineapples . 
  when was this ? 
  [ this is probably the radio interview you 're talking about ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsx9ndwbd_w ) . 
  unless you mean you heard a programme on your local radio station . 
  ( i know i once did . ), 
  the celeste is one of my favourite instruments , right behind the duduk . 
  edit : while we 're on obscure instruments , here 's the [ glass armonica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqemvyyj--g ) , which is essentially a mechanised version of different sized glasses of water . 
  [ here 's another site ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/composers ) where you can see which composer 's political beliefs you most align with . 
  holy shit , this is serious ? 
  the guy a few posts up was describing it too . 
  i just assumed it was a big joke , and all the replies were playing along . 
  it 's not just reddit would describe them as conservative . 
  they self describe as right wing in economics . 
  back during the australian election they came out in support of our more left wing party , including an admission that this was not in line with their usual beliefs , and an explanation of why they switched . 
  as a composer , i laugh at you all . 
  except the tenor clef . 
  fuck the tenor clef . 
  if you alter the key signature up two sharps , alto clef is the same as playing a bb instrument ( e.g. 
  trumpet and clarinet ) in the treble clef . 
  the more you know . 
  yeah i was sitting at a piano and i played the notes without consciously reading them , and did n't get the joke at first either . 
  haha yeah . 
  it 's mainly only used on lower instruments when they need to play high . 
  cellos and bassoonists frequently have to read it . 
  they 're both absolutely amazing instruments . 
  i 'm particularly fond of the opening to [ the rite of spring ] ( http://youtu.be/rq1q6u3mlsm?t=6m15s ) on bassoon , and [ elgar 's cello concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=681nvqpo2eu ) .
