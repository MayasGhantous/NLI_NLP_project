  americans distinguish between smooth jams and jams that have bits of fruit still in them . 
  if you 're british or australian ( or , basically from anywhere english speaking outside of north america ) , just continue calling them all jam . 
   and a white person wo n't know the difference anyway, 
  i mean , that 's generally true , but as a white person who lived in korea for a few years . 
  heck yeah i can tell the difference . 
  as an australian , i love me some pancakes or waffles with maple syrup for breakfast . 
  but only * very * rarely . 
  usually when i 'm at a hotel . 
  if i had that every morning , i 'd be sick . 
  but do most americans actually eat these things for breakfast most days ? 
  i suspect not . 
  no , when something is an entrance , it means it opens the way to something else . 
  [ read this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entr%c3%a9e ) for the history of the term . 
  i get that this is a joke , but i 'm getting so fucking sick of it . 
  [ australia is more economically free than the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_economic_freedom ) . 
  [ it has the exact same rating on the `` freedom in the world '' index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_in_the_world ) . 
  [ and a more free press ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worldwide_press_freedom_index ) . 
  sure , the us is a very free country . 
  but so is most of europe , and australia , and pretty much any developed country . 
  they go nuts when you say a few words in korean , or demonstrate that you can read the alphabet . 
  story checks out . 
  yeah i figured . 
  cheers . 
  koreans use \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b , which is just kkkkkkkk . 
  haha yeah , i 'm exactly the same . 
  i know about a dozen words ( excluding numbers -- can count up to 999,999 ) , but reading the language always really impresses them , even if i have n't got a clue what i 'm reading . 
  no , it 's not the american meaning . 
  my entire point was that the american meaning does n't make sense in the context of the meaning of the word and the word 's history . 
  i 'm assuming it 's just a friendly reminder or something . 
   people still use the word englishmen ? 
  yes ? 
   it 's like those fucking customers who finish their meal and then declare they did n't like it and want a refund . 
  except most customers do n't . 
  just like most people are willing to pay for something that they get legitimate use out of , most people eat their meal and then pay for it , and so restaurants are still able to make a profit . 
  the people who would rather take advantage of this kind of thing are probably pirating rather than buying it , anyway . 
  it 's a decent and reasonable policy to implement , and many developed countries already legally require something similar . 
  more like a bond villain , i think . 
  you know what * else * is natural , mr. 
  bond ? 
  death . 
  it 's illegal . 
  many around here ( including myself ) think it * should n't * be illegal , but it is . 
  it 's up to the police to uphold the law , even if that law is dumb . 
  they would n't be doing their job otherwise . 
  fuck man , i feel so bad for poor turing . 
  they guy played a huge part in the allies winning world war ii . 
  he basically provided the foundations to allow computers to be invented . 
  and he ended up being driven to suicide because of a particular trait he was born with . 
  do n't feel too bad . 
  [ pretty sure the person who actually posted that was just calling apple users gay ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1tga6k/kill_gays_bill_just_passed_in_uganda_president/ce7qq6j?context=3 ) , without the deeper context being intended . 
  just tell it your address is in the us . 
  that 's what i did to get the bioshock triple pack a few weeks back . 
  works perfectly . 
  when i 'm out , i make no effort to hide the fact that i switch all cutlery around at the beginning of the meal . 
  the number of left handed people is somewhere between 1 in 9 and 1 in 11 , that 's hardly a small number . 
  i find it mildly irritating the extent to which things are geared towards right handed users only . 
  fancy shaped cutlery like the one you described really annoys me ( it 's usually right handed knives ) , and unfortunately the places i 've been to have n't ever offered left handed versions . 
  that 's really nice of the place you want to offer different versions . 
  yeah , the other thread kinda surprised me that many people ( who i assume are mostly americans ) use their knives in their right hand . 
  but then , americans are also the ones who call the main meal an entr\u00e9e and switch hands with cutlery while eating . 
  so i guess i should n't be surprised that their weird food etiquette extends to lefties . 
  at my school ib was very strongly associated with a strong procrastination mentality , and with an expectation of running on tiny amounts of sleep . 
  beyond that , it varied wildly . 
  there were a couple of people for whom class placement was important , but that was mostly just playful joking between them . 
  some people were happy to just be passing . 
  most were in between . 
  i do n't know why , but i decided to google kukukuku . 
  i got [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angu_people\u200e ) . 
  mass effect does both . 
  you get the conversations between characters that provided some interesting insight into the characters . 
  it 's been a while since i played portal , but i thought it had some conversation in the elevators too . 
  while i agree that you make a very good point , i do n't think that it 's accurate to use this to justify a response of `` nope '' to my earlier response . 
  ignoring the inherent rudeness of such a reply , we use the phrase `` born that way '' for many things that are not explicitly genetic . 
  the purpose of the phrase in this context is that it 's not a conscious choice . 
  that was clearly my intended meaning ; no more , no less . 
  the smile on the face , plus the fact that this is so absurd , leads me to believe the photo 's probably staged . 
  no worries man , it 's all good . 
  i 'm playing through the witcher at the moment , and really enjoying it . 
  i have n't played for a few weeks , though . 
  nothing to do with the game , but because the game is constantly crashing on me . 
  ( the mac ` version ' is really god-awfully ported . ), 
  i 'm curious , what specifically is a crpg ? 
  how does it differ from normal rpgs ? 
  oh right . 
  so in the context of computer games , basically any rpg ( mass effect , witcher , the various mmorpgs and jrpgs , etc. ), 
  is a crpg ? 
  i was sick of it the second time i saw it . 
  ah right . 
  thanks for that . 
  i just assumed it did because the person i replied to said it did . 
  pc games as opposed to console games ? 
  that makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  is that western ? 
  i 'm still trying to grind my way through the first witcher . 
  grinding not because the game itself is bad . 
  in fact , i love the gameplay and the story . 
  it 's grinding because the damn thing crashes every fucking hour . 
  and that 's * after * going through the process of wrapping it in a custom wrapper . 
   he knows that we are all popes in the end,
