  does n't matter . 
  there are many ways to change someone 's view on a given topic . 
  if he had changed op 's view from `` basketball is a dull sport '' to `` actually , sports are a dull concept '' , that would be a valid change . 
  unlikely to happen , but it 's still perfectly valid . 
  i gave an example of the effects being used badly , but in general they were pretty good . 
  the acting was awful , in particular that scene near the end where superman does some sort of dramatic scream . 
  i think he was on his knees . 
  that stood out to me as an example of just awful clich\u00e9 acting . 
  music is my particular area of expertise , and it was one area that i was * particularly * disappointed in . 
  but then again , i was expecting disappointment when i found out that a ) hans zimmer was doing the music , and b ) they were n't going to be using john williams ' original theme . 
  the music in harry potter went downhill when williams left after the third one ( with the exception of the 5th film , which i really liked the music of ) , but at least there they were able to continue using williams ' original themes . 
  hans zimmer 's scores are dull at the best of times . 
  with the exception of pirates of the caribbean , i ca n't think of a single zimmer score that i was impressed by in the least ( the lion king had great music , but its greatness was in the elton john songs rather than zimmer 's score ) , but when he 's writing something that 's so obviously going to be compared to the works of the greatest film composer ever , he 's bound to fall sadly short . 
  i do n't know why they could n't at the very least get permission to use williams ' themes . 
  maybe the rights were too complicated , maybe they simply did n't want to , but it was a bad move on their part . 
  williams ' themes have been associated with superman for decades , including the 2006 reboot . 
  leaving them out just ruins the credibility of the music as being music for `` superman '' . 
  but even if we overlook that . 
  pretend none of the previous superman films had any music at all . 
  the music for this one was lackluster . 
  listen to the [ main theme ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=engkxf3cqh4 ) . 
  it starts off with great potential , like it 's building to something heroic and awesome . 
  and then it does n't . 
  it just feels like it keeps building , without ever actually getting anywhere . 
  ( and no , upping the dynamic level and using a truck driver 's gear change does n't count as `` getting somewhere '' . ), 
  most of the music in the film was exactly the same . 
  it just did n't deliver on the promise that was very good motivic material . 
  this comment from that youtube comment section really sums up my feelings of the music and the movie in general . 
   this is n't bad music , but the film failed for me simply because it completely excised the humor and charm that is inherent with superman , humor and charm that is embedded in the classic john williams theme . 
   so yeah , they needed to have a new theme because mos is very different in tone , but i wish they could have salvaged the part of superman that has made him so endearing to many instead of turning him into to this angst-y batman-clone . 
  i 'd be interested in your response to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/1tq81g/to_tease_all_of_you_asking_for_a_shared_universe/cebu4bf?context=2 ), 
  i 'd be interested in your response to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/1tq81g/to_tease_all_of_you_asking_for_a_shared_universe/cebu4bf?context=2 ), 
  yeah , i figured some would . 
  i must say i 'm surprised at the amount of downvotes with so few people actually chiming in to state otherwise , let alone give reasons . 
  anyway , i 'd be interested in your response to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/1tq81g/to_tease_all_of_you_asking_for_a_shared_universe/cebu4bf?context=2 ) . 
  based on the fact that it says `` sixth form '' , i 'm lead to believe it 's the final two years of secondary school . 
  in the uk students complete normal secondary school after year 11 and do their gcses . 
  the final two years ( 12 and 13 ) , known as `` sixth form '' , they study for their a levels . 
  at least , that 's what i gathered from going to a british-inspired international school . 
  it sounds to me like you read half of it , and then stopped . 
  sure , a lot of my problem was that it was n't the original superman theme , but it had some very serious technical problems with it . 
  it 's a completely uninspiring score and honestly it 's poorly written , even if you overlook the historical score . 
  i have to say , i agree , the character development was pretty damn good . 
  i agree , the music did fit the tone of the movie . 
  i find it interesting that you brought up [ mos spoiler ] ( #s his father 's death scene ) as being a weaker point . 
  to me , that scene really epitomises what 's wrong with the whole premise of the movie . 
  various comic book iterations of the character might alter exactly when/if [ mos spoiler ] ( #s clark 's dad and/or mum die ) , but i do n't think it 's ever really been a driving force in the character 's arc . 
  but in this it was . 
  they tried to make the movie feel much more like the nolan films . 
  much darker . 
  but that 's just not what superman is . 
  the music fit the tone of the movie -- fit the tone , although was substandard in itself -- but the tone of the movie was the wrong one for the character . 
  what , exactly , was britta to abed in this context ? 
  i think the implication is that the people filing these lawsuits should be actually disadvantaged , rather than people who go out of their way to * find * reasons that they can sue . 
  jeff becoming a professor was revealed in trailers . 
  i could be wrong , but i think pierce being dead is just a well-held rumour . 
  we know the actor is n't coming back , so they need to do something to not make it weird that the character is gone . 
  death seems the most likely solution . 
  but like i said , i could be wrong -- maybe it has been revealed officially . 
  ah , right . 
  cheers . 
  ok is the joke here that you 're pretending to be stupid ( in which case , i honestly just do n't find it funny ) , or is it a reference to something that i 'm not getting ? 
  a 7 ( your flair ) ? 
  damn , i 'm impressed . 
  i got out of it with a 5 . 
  for what it 's worth , those errors did n't last very long . 
  and the dev knows the game is sometimes unstable , that 's why they give you controls to manually adjust your different stats . 
  yeah he did . 
  and i suppose it would n't be too hard to do that , but to me it seems better this way . 
  anything else would 've felt wrong . 
  the character has been friends with them for so long , for him to up and leave after graduation would be odd . 
  i imagine that they 'll get another , larger , offer soon , which would mean turning down facebook 's initial offer was the smart move . 
  but if they turn down the next one , they 're absolutely nuts . 
   composed for the celebration of the 37th anniversary of the 1917 revolution , was given its first performance on november 6 , 1954, 
  i do n't even . 
  it 's in the fucking name . 
   opens with the grandest of ceremonial fanfares, 
  and oh god , they 're not even doing the full piece , just one of those `` finale '' versions . 
   in the bright key of a major, 
  [ i do n't even ] ( http://imgur.com/uk5kmds ), 
  of course , there are many more problems with it . 
  i just wanted to pick on the most egregious . 
  mingus in general is awesomely accessible and groovy . 
  probably his most well-known piece is [ moanin ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__osyznvdoy ) , and it 's great !, 
  he meant between the hobbit and lotr , not before the hobbit . 
  this probably is n't the best time , but just thought i 'd chime in to say that the expression is * could n't * care less , indicating that you care exactly zero . 
  could care less just does n't make sense . 
  it could mean care a really really small amount , or it could mean care a lot . 
  there 's no way to tell . 
  you seem to be talking about primary advertisement ( which is what i 'm assuming it 's called , based on what the other guy called secondary advertisement ) , when the other guy was describing secondary advertisement . 
  he 's not talking about when you see a game on the front page of the steam store -- apple , microsoft , etc. 
  do that too -- he 's talking about when you see in your friends list `` mike is playing call of duty : ghosts '' , which might make you want to get the game , or at least put the idea in your head . 
  he listed that as `` things more likely to happen '' . 
  seeing as one of the other ones ( getting gold ) already * did * happen right in front of us , it 's safe to say he was n't being facetious with that comment , and was in fact listing things more likely to happen . 
  would you say the ridiculous rules effect change in your affect ? 
  then would you care to explain it ? 
  people have written great answers regarding classical music in general . 
  i 'll address john williams specifically . 
  williams makes heavy use of a technique called `` leitmotif '' . 
  a leitmotif is a short melody or phrase associated with an idea , person , or place .
