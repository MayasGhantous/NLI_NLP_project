  for example , the most obvious leitmotif in star wars is `` darth vader 's theme '' , the theme associated with darth vader . 
  it 's most prominently heard in the track [ the imperial march ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzwsjg93p8 ) . 
  as i said , leitmotifs can also be associated with ideas . 
  an example of this would be [ the force theme ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcz9kq1h-zy ) , which is associated with the force , and the mystery thereof . 
  i ca n't think of any examples of leitmotifs representing places in star wars , but howard shore uses them to great effect in lord of the rings . 
  in particular , you can hear the minas tirith theme played at the beginning of [ the realm of gondor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_jfhls2nc4 ) . 
  both williams and shore will alter themes to change the mood . 
  for example , you heard the minas tirith theme played at the beginning in quite a sad , lonely way , representing the city 's status as the last hope preventing mordor from taking over . 
  other times you hear it in full fanfare , representing its might . 
  williams does something really interesting when he approaches the star wars prequels . 
  listen closely to [ anakin 's theme ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_rzi7y_nus ) , from the phantom menace . 
  at first it sounds innocent , representing the innocence of the young anakin . 
  but start to analyse it more closely , and you notice harmonic instability , and a motive that vaguely resembles darth vader 's theme . 
  there 's been a lot of work done in analysing the specifics . 
  if you 're interested , [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_wars_music ) explains many of the various leitmotifs in star wars , while [ this page ] ( http://academic.depauw.edu/aevans_web/honr101-02/webpages/spring2006/rooney ( jessica \\ ) / starwarsleitmotif.htm ) goes into greater detail of a handful of the motifs . 
  if you have any other questions , or anything i was n't clear about , feel free to ask . 
  i 'd be happy to help . 
   i 'm assuming the markers should be able to understand the syntax, 
  unfortunately , ee markers do n't specialise in the subject that they 're marking . 
  they 're probably not going to actually understand much of the code at all . 
  you should n't let that alter how you write your essay , though . 
  still write it as though an expert were the one reading it . 
  right . 
  so which part of your comment did i miss , exactly ? 
  can we get an / r/shittyclassical started ? 
  oh right . 
  no , i did n't miss that . 
  in fact , i specifically mentioned that , in a back-handed way . 
  yeah , background girl 's nose seems wider , and her chin pointier than gillian 's . 
  who exactly are you talking about when you say it was made by a `` different studio which has since been shut down '' ? 
  the wikipedia page for [ bioshock 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bioshock_2 ) lists * a couple of subsidiaries of 2k * as being the main developers . 
  multiplayer was done by * digital extremes * , * arkane studios * helped with level design , * darkside game studios * did some `` additional work '' , and * feral interactive * did the port to os x. 
  none of those have gone out of business . 
  can i just say , thanks for remembering to mark this as a spoiler . 
  also , leaving this comment so i can come back to read it once i 've played the game . 
  eh , these are really trivial tips . 
  the only one i did n't already know was removing the name from bookmarks , and that 's just because it 's something i 've never really thought of before . 
  1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , and 9 are * extremely * basic , 4 and 5 are n't much more complicated , and 10 is going to need a printer that 's set up to allow that kind of thing anyway , so is of little use to most users . 
  ah right . 
  i checked , and they had another game come out this year . 
  `` the bureau : xcom declassified '' . 
  is that the game you were talking about that never should have got off the drawing board ? 
  but marin does n't seem to have been shut down . 
  reduced significantly with rumours that the remaining employees will be `` folded into '' a new 2k subsidiary , but not exactly shut down . 
  fair enough . 
  thanks for the info . 
  cool , i 'll give it a look . 
  thanks again . 
  oh cool , i did n't know . 
  in that case , any advantages of it over using the normal printer dialogue ? 
  a ) he 's talking about the tv show avatar : the last airbender . 
  b ) he never said anything about * everyone * wanting to live like this . 
  he specifically said it was about himself . 
  how exactly does that work without the network enabled printer ? 
  would you have to keep one computer connected to the printer by usb signed into the same google account ? 
  youtube says [ shenandoah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qvoqvx2vpe ), 
  some common copypasta, 
   the boston symphony recently performed beethoven 's ninth symphony which is a wonderful piece that has a part near the end in which the contrabasses do nothing . 
  so , the bassists snuck offstage , out the backdoor , and next door to the local pub for a drink . 
   after quickly gulping down a few stiff drinks , one of them checked his watch and said , ` oh no , we only have 30 seconds to get back ! ', 
   another bassist said , ` do n't worry , i tied the last page of the conductor 's score down with string to give us a bit more time . 
   so , they staggered and stumbled back into the concert hall and took their places just as the conductor was busily working on the knot in the string so he could finish the symphony . 
  someone in the audience asked his companion , ` what 's going on ? 
  is there a problem ? ', 
   his companion said , ` this is a critical point - it 's the bottom of the ninth , the score 's tied , and the bassists are loaded ! ', 
  if they 're using their phones to browse the web or text in a rehearsal , there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  calling people , hell yeah there 's a problem . 
  in an actual performance , obviously neither would be acceptable , but i do feel that being on your phone would be * worse * , because it gives off its own light source . 
  neither of those pages helped at all . 
  [ this one does much better ] ( https://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/howitworks.html ) , although the video looks like they got an intern to do it . 
  but yeah , if you do n't have a special printer , you need the printer to be connected to an alway-on computer for this to work . 
  the user you replied to said `` at least they 're not on their phones '' . 
  in this context , the implication of that was * using * their phones , as , you know , phones . 
  poorly . 
  honestly , the ee marking is , [ in my opinion ] ( http://zagorath.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/problems-with-ib/ ) , one of the biggest flaws with the ib diploma programme . 
  how do they do it , exactly ? 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  i guess that they probably do some cursory research into it , or go purely based on whether it * appears * as though you are using the words correctly . 
  that part was never really explained to me . 
  i would recommend adding comments in at the same rate as you would in general programming ( or , to be more precise , in the way that you * should * in general programming ) . 
  maybe err on the side of caution , and add a few more that you might leave out otherwise , but do n't go overboard . 
  most importantly , i 'd double check all of this with your supervisor . 
  any chance you could tell us what * type * of software company/programme this is ? 
  more importantly , is it consumer software , or is it something internal ? 
  it might be commonly practised , but the first thing you learn when learning about security is that security through obscurity is no security at all . 
  source : recently started listening through the backlog of the security now !, 
  podcast . 
  all the way from episode one . 
  security through obscurity definitely got brought up in the first handful of episodes . 
  yeah he did . 
  i had the page open when it happened and saved myself a copy in case i wanted to go back over it . 
  not sharing it with anyone , though . 
  it 'd be unethical , not to mention probably against reddit 's tos . 
  edit : [ here 's the remains of it on reddit , though ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1484qo/i_am_a_professional_hacker_pentester_companies/ ) . 
  there 're a handful of comments that have n't been deleted . 
  ooo good point . 
  fair point . 
  damn , that was a heap more specific than i could have ever hoped for . 
  no , he works for a big security company now ( or , at least , he did at the time , no idea what the fallout was regarding the ama ) . 
  got started as a script kiddie hacking stuff , though .
