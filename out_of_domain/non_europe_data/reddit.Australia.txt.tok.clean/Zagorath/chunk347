  the hosts file acts as a sort of mini-dns , and it takes precedence over your normal dns , so by doing this , your computer will redirect `` thepiratebay.com '' to that ip address , regardless of what the actual domain tpb is really on . 
  a ) only works properly in certain countries . 
  sure you can get around it , but it 's easier to pirate , so why bother ? 
  b ) even where they do exist , they do n't have anything close to most/all of the content people want to watch, 
  c ) related to b , in many cases , you wo n't be able to get the content as soon as it comes out . 
  this is especially important for tv shows where you want to be able to watch it and discuss it without getting spoilers . 
  yeah i just looked it up . 
  apparently the famous '' [ benny hill theme ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk6txmsvgqg ) '' comes from a tv show called the benny hill show ( who woulda thunk it ? 
  ) , which was indeed british . 
  dunno if the show actually used this particular gag , but seeing as the benny hill theme is so closely associated with it , i imagine it did . 
  true that . 
  i had it on bananasrus.com just for the heck of it . 
  best way to edit hosts on os x is to enter, 
  sudo nano / private/etc/hosts, 
  into the terminal . 
  same thing would probably be true in linux . 
  the situation at hand is a hypothetical omnipotent being asking people what they want changed . 
  science does n't really need to come into it . 
  ah fair enough , thanks . 
  i have n't seen it . 
  both vi and nano are included in os x and most common distros of linux . 
  i went with nano mainly because when i looked for instructions on the location of the hosts file , the guide used nano . 
  i just copied and pasted it . 
  have to say , though , i prefer the vi editor 's interface . 
  i 've heard it called that before but did n't know that was it 's original name . 
  i tried to find a source to disprove this , but all i came up with was [ this ] ( http://www.therichest.com/business/the-top-10-countries-with-the-highest-minimum-wages/10/ ) shitty article . 
  it says the netherlands have the highest minimum wage in the world , and yet their stated figure for the netherlands ' minimum wage is lower than australia 's . 
  so i guess you 're right , we really do have the highest . 
  i see people saying this all the time , but it definitely has n't been my experience . 
  i 've do n't think i 've ever had service i would say i was unhappy with . 
  ninjaedit : no , cancel that . 
  but i could count on one hand the number of times . 
   if you run into an asshole in the morning , you ran into an asshole . 
  if you run into assholes all day , you 're the asshole . 
  pro tip , a string quartet plus a clarinet is usually called a `` clarinet quintet '' . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  shenzhen is already a special economic zone , which does n't provide it anything close to as much freedom as hong kong has , but it certainly does bring it closer economically to hk than cities like beijing are . 
  finally , hans zimmer soundtracks are good for * something * . 
  ( not that i 'm bitter about the latest superman movie 's soundtrack at all ... ), 
  yeah i have to be honest , it 's not for me . 
  i love my hot showers , even in hot weather or after running . 
  a 4 minute shower challenge would be more up my alley , although it certainly would be a challenge . 
  aww damn , that sucks . 
  i was gon na tell my british friends about this , thinking that the ban was more superficial . 
  guess they 'll just have to keep using proxybay . 
  yeah , it does feel really slow . 
  the original marking was `` allegro con brio '' . 
  i 'm looking for a source on the tempo beethoven marked for it when he went back and gave metronome markings . 
  it 's worth noting that people have a history of playing beethoven pieces slower than he probably intended , though . 
  the first movement of his sonata no. 14 `` moonlight '' is particularly guilty of this , although so is the third movement of it , or the 1st movement of symphony no. 5 . 
  edit : [ this score ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/a/a6/imslp52766-pmlp02581-beethoven_werke_breitkopf_serie_1_no_3_op_55.pdf ) says it should be about 60 dotted minums per minute . 
  i timed it and it seemed to actually be just under 50 . 
  the difference might not seem like much , but if you go to crotchets that 's 180 beats per minute compared to under 150 . 
  so yeah , it is quite a slow recording . 
  he 's being downvoted because he 's stating something as as blunt fact that he has no justification for , and that other people disagree with ( `` service in australia is shit '' ) . 
  he 's also promoting a particular aspect of american culture which people have a * strong * distaste for . 
  it 's a tad more complicated than because he 's saying `` something vaguely negative about australia '' . 
  i agree with you about the nationalism thing , although i would argue it is n't only young australians by any stretch . 
  any sort of blind nationalism really makes my blood boil , and seeing the increase of it in australia is really irksome . 
  i just do n't think that 's all that 's at play in this case . 
  i get the impression that when people talk about australia or europe as having bad service , this is exactly what they 're talking about . 
  they * like * fake arse-kissing . 
  that 's what they consider good service . 
  to me , that 's the only explanation , because i have n't been * anywhere * where i would say the service was consistently * bad * . 
  that 's counting australia , much of eastern asia , and a few places in europe and elsewhere . 
  bad service has never been the norm , and i think people who find it * is * are just looking for it . 
  it 's marked a la breve , which means it 's in 2 . 
  each bar has two beats , which means 6 quaver triplets . 
  not 4 beats with 3 quaver triplets . 
  it 's also marked adagio . 
  people tend to play it adagio as though it 's in 4 , which it should be adagio in 2 . 
  that actually means that they 're playing it at * half * the speed that 's notated . 
  [ this lecture by andras schiff ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw_dv_gnqao ) goes into great detail about that and other aspects of the moonlight sonata . 
  he 's a bit `` my way is right , anything else is wrong '' , but i really feel that he * is * definitively correct on this particular matter . 
  if you 're interested , [ he did a lecture for every single one of beethoven 's piano sonatas ] ( http://music.theguardian.com/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) . 
  i 've only listened to a few , but they 're well worth it , even if you are n't planning on playing them yourself . 
  [ here 's a performance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80zmsda5q8q ) i did of the first movement of sonata no . 
  14 , inspired greatly by schiff 's lecture . 
  being an electric piano it * really * suffers in terms of the sound and pedalwork , but i feel you can get the idea . 
  edit : by the way [ here ] ( http://www.radiolab.org/story/269783-speedy-beet/ ) is the source i mentioned in the other thread for why beethoven 's metronome markings were n't necessarily wrong . 
  i have to say , i ** really ** prefer the faster tempos for beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 , too . 
  the biggest difference -- nay , the only important difference -- is that scientology demands its practitioners cut themselves off from their non-practising family and friends . 
  no ` religion ' that demands this should be given any legal status , in my opinion . 
  the fact that they believe really weird shit , and even the fact that they make people pay obscene amounts of money to essentially ` level up ' within the religion 's ranks , that stuff does n't really matter . 
   what 's the difference between a religion and a cult ? 
   in a cult there 's a person at the top who knows it 's all a sham . 
  in a religion , that person died a long time ago . 
  i figured i 'd own up to it to save anyone else the trouble . 
  [ except ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_inquisition ) [ when ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusades ) [ they ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/september_11_attacks ) [ do ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_bali_bombings ) . 
  mmm yeah , that makes sense . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i linked to 4 examples of religion causing the * deaths * of hundreds of people ( or more ) in each case . 
  those were just the four that first came to mind . 
  it would n't be hard to come up with more if one wanted to . 
  you linked to 4 examples of religion being involved in the deaths ... of people . 
  you start by saying `` no '' , and then you paraphrase my own point . 
  heck , it was almost word-for-word quoting . 
  which is it ? 
  but you 've changed the argument now .
