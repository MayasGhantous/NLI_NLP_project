  good luck with the legalisation of marijuana ( if that sounds sarcastic , it was n't meant to ) . 
  we 're a long way away from getting that in aus ... there is n't even significant talk about it ( though marriage equality finally seems to be picking up speed ) . 
  cctv is everywhere * in public locations * . 
  it 's not a violation of privacy because it 's things that you are doing in public , and you therefore do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy . 
  any good history class will make you try to see both sides of the situation . 
  you should be able to see that there * are * good things on both sides , and come to a weighted conclusion ( in this case , very few people would be able to make a good argument to say that the weighting comes down in favour of the nazis , but that 's not the point here ) . 
  have you only been using macs for the last 10 + years ? 
  because i 've never had 2-finger scrolling on a non-mac laptop , and only once or twice had edge scrolling . 
  only a handful of my friends have these features , too . 
  you on a mac ? 
  this is a known bug in mavericks with a very simple solution , albeit one that is somewhat unsavoury to me . 
  you need to turn off the two-finger swipe to go `` back '' and `` forward '' . 
  a little ? 
  god no . 
  we come down on the same side of this issue , i just found the above an uncompelling argument . 
  oh no it is about the culture of guns . 
  the part i was disagreeing with was that you can easily compare other countries based on per capita guns owned , without taking into account other regulations . 
  you jest , but i think you 're closer than you think . 
  he probably would 've been jealous and angry at his friend who had everything . 
  he 's the heir to the fire nation throne , and he 's the avatar , the guy responsible for maintaining peace and balance in the world . 
  indeed , i want a show about firelord avatar ( labelled [ nessarose in this image ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/85/3a/853a62_3828727.jpg ) ) . 
  what exactly does `` in the sea '' mean ? 
  randomly on some deserted beach , or at a patrolled beach with lots of people around ? 
  makes a big difference . 
  i reckon they 'd at least pronounce your city 's name correctly if they saw it written , unlike bris - [ bane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bane_ ( comics \\ ) ) , can - [ bear ] ( http://pocketrangerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/grizzly.jpg ) - a or mel - [ bourne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourne_ ( film_series \\ ) ) . 
  some guys added it for something to do during their refractory period . 
  but it makes a difference as to how you interpret it , so it matters . 
  the games thing is insurmountable ( console exclusives are exclusive to console ) , but you can play pc games on your tv with a controller . 
  it 's definitely not as easy to set up , and some games wo n't work well with it , but it is technically doable . 
  not trying to actually get you to switch to pc . 
  heck , i would n't really even * recommend * doing what i said . 
  i just thought it 's worth bringing up that it is possible . 
  that * was * a really interesting article . 
  and really scary , too . 
  that someone who is trying to bring a voice of reason into the extremist views -- even though he himself would probably have previously been seen as an extremist to outsiders -- would be completely shot down like that ( pun not intended ) . 
  and then when shooting someone dead is a valid defence against someone in a drunken argument . 
  just ... yikes . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  haha , that made me laugh way more than it should have . 
  but you have a good point , in real life that is n't typically the case . 
  it is , however , a fairly common trope in tv and film and can be used to great effect , if done well . 
  yay that 's what i have , too !, 
  absolutely love my stock android . 
  i 'm really hoping that they do get back up . 
  my experience was that it is generally much better than the pirate bay . 
  it frequently had torrents that tpb did not , especially for more obscure interests . 
  both times , my order was, 
  questionable content ( official website ), 
  queen 's counsel ( wp article ), 
  quality control ( wp article ), 
  qc wp disambiguation page, 
  no change . 
  but anyway , changing in that way is a good thing . 
  they 're aiming to show you what they think you are most likely to be interested in . 
  that 's their job , after all . 
  to return the best search result possible , even if that means your results are different from someone else 's . 
  that 's not how it was at my primary school . 
  i remember there were a few kids who left class during those classes and temporarily went to the class next door ( same year grade ) . 
  what are the stats on childhood injury rates in norway versus the rest of the world ? 
  because that 's what really matters , even if theoretically they have lower safety standards . 
  which laws are you referring to , exactly ? 
  i do n't know what it was like at the time , but you should see the way most of / r/community talks about season 4 right now . 
  if you could provide the article you read , that 'd be awesome . 
  but honestly , it makes a lot of sense to me . 
  kids 'll get roughed up a little bit , because they 're being kids , having fun playing rough games . 
  if there are * less * serious injuries , i 'd say that 's even better . 
  ( especially in light of [ this recent minuteearth video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex5y6ovvhe0 ) about allergies . 
  actually , that 's * far * from a given ( as in , it 's ambiguous whether or not tolkien intended balrogs to have wings ) . 
  [ good analysis ] ( http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/did_balrogs_have_wings%3f ), 
  shark jumping episode ? 
  i have a problem with it . 
  tolkien 's works were pretty clear on this matter . 
  that said , it 's not a big deal . 
  after an initial `` oh , this is n't a dragon , it 's a wyvern '' , i hardly even noticed it while i was watching the movie . 
  so while i do have a problem with the change that does n't add anything to the story and detracts somewhat from lore , it 's only a tiny blemish in an otherwise fantastic film . 
  [ i 'm just glad they did n't use a simian mouth ] ( http://superiorpics.com/movie_pictures/mp/2006_eragon/2006_eragon_025.jpg ) , and i 'm impressed they went to the effort of researching the pronunciation of smaug and pronouncing it how tolkien intended , rather than going with the more common pronunciation . 
   it 's a loose-loose situation, 
  you did that deliberately , did n't you ? 
  can i ask , what * is * the device for people who just want to be able to stream local content to their tv ? 
  a * cheap * hardware device that connects via hdmi to the tv , and over wifi to get the actual content from a local computer . 
  the chromecast * seems * as though it would offer this , by playing files in the browser , but i 've been trying it out , and most mkv files seem to play muted , avi files do n't work at all , ts files seem to try to download an extra copy , and only mp4 works correctly consistently . 
  i 've tried a bunch of mkv files and found that some had audio that worked , and some did n't . 
  google + is a technically better product in every single way . 
  the only reason people do n't use it en masse is because people already use facebook . 
  there is no video service comparable to youtube . 
  because of the way the game is set up ( it 's a very linear story ) , it actually makes for a fantastic cinematic experience . 
  find a good let 's play on youtube -- one that does n't talk and ruin it . 
  watch it that way . 
  i 'm a pc gamer , and my ps gaming friend told me i should do that , and i 'm so glad i did . 
  even without actually being in control of it , it was still an incredible experience . 
  what about os x ? 
  and according to [ this list ] ( http://support.roku.com/entries/423946-what-media-file-types-does-the-roku-usb-media-player-channel-support - ) of files supported -- the link to which i found in [ this comparison of media streaming devices ] ( http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/roku-3-best-streaming-box/ ) -- the roku is pretty decent , but still very limited in terms of which files it supports , not supporting avi or ts files . 
  yeah that 's what i assumed too . 
  do n't worry , you answered the question for me and others who do n't know the character . 
  i was massively into runescape from about 10 -- 13 . 
  i do n't think he has yet , i think it 's just been confirmed that at some point he will . 
   this is the only answer that replies as a social person , and that 's why it sounds like the most debilitating of all choices ... 
  dude what ? 
  a ) this is the answer most of the thread seems to be made up of . 
  b ) it 's an answer * designed * bit to be debilitating , because it gets you to say very little and get the conversation away from yourself as quickly as possible .
