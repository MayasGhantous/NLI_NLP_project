  just wanted to point out that you completely forgot the arts in there . 
  i 'm also not entirely clear on the difference between numeracy and the rest of maths . 
  but that sounds to me like you only study the arts with respect to the culture they originate from . 
  i would argue that a more robust study of musical history and theory , as well as some basic performing and composing skill , is something that should stand on its own and be taught as its own subject . 
  same with drama and visual arts . 
  wait , so they did n't ban sliced bread , only bread that comes pre-sliced . 
  i 'd rather my civil engineers knew what they were doing . 
  sure , in the last , say , four years of highschool it should be optional . 
  ( check out how ib subject blocks work , it 's a great system ) , but in primary school and early highschool those should be compulsory just like anything else . 
  edit : and do n't knock photography , it 's a great art form . 
  restaurants could still serve sliced bread . 
  the only thing that was banned was pre-sliced bread . 
  yeah honestly i absolutely despise people like this . 
  sure , the laws are dumb and pointless , and they should n't be in place , but that 's not the point here . 
  the point is that he 's being a complete dick to them without valid reason . 
  could they have responded better ? 
  yeah , sure they could , but again , that 's not the point . 
  he 's behaving in a manner that is completely unnecessary and arrogant way . 
  if he behaved respectfully , then perhaps they would , too . 
  if he did and then they did n't , * then * we 'd have a problem on our hands . 
  you see dicks like this all the time on reddit . 
  basically any time cops get mentioned it 'll eventually end up in a conversation like this . 
  i 'm honestly disappointed that it is n't only an american thing , and that there are australians that can be this arrogant , too . 
  oh , and by the way . 
  [ it is n't hard to record video properly ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9zsfinwfa ) . 
  based on your current views , the current party policies , and the current standing of parties , i 'd say the greens are probably great for you , but obviously not perfect . 
  as / u/dubious _ virtue said , joining them and helping to change their view from the inside is a great idea . 
  i do n't follow . 
  if they flood to the alp , then wo n't the alp be more likely to win the next election , and then we do n't have to put up with the lnp for another term , surely ? 
  it 's there from the beginning . 
  the catch is that it 's the camera holder that 's doing the harassing . 
  but the original idea was that bikies should advertise lnp , thus driving the anti-biker brigade to support the alp . 
  not a `` game '' in the same sense as these , but [ habitrpg ] ( https://habitrpg.com/ ) does this too . 
  honestly my favourite bot is / u/autowikibot . 
  man when they first implemented the new system with five different inboxes ( primary , social , promotions , updates , forums ) i was sceptical . 
  i liked the old system with the important mail . 
  but now that i 've used it for a while i 'm amazed . 
  it works so incredibly well ; i never get email in my primary inbox that was n't from some * one * i 'm actually talking with , and all the others work perfectly how you would expect . 
  yeah , even if the musicians can all play together when playing behind the beat , music is all about the performance , and to the audience it looks so much better to see the conductor directly controlling the orchestra . 
  it just does n't look right . 
  the distance to the audience is irrelevant . 
  what can make a difference is the distance from the back of the orchestra to the front , because all sounds need to arrive at the front row seats at the same time . 
  if they do that , then they 'll be together all the way to the back . 
  in the vast majority of cases , the orchestra could fit in about 10 m front to back , which would be a delay of about 1/30th of a second . 
  now we 're down to levels not noticeable by ear . 
  sound travels at about [ 340 m/s at 20 \u00b0 ( i.e. , roughly room temperature ) in standard pressure ] ( http://wolframalpha.com/input/?i=speed+of+sound&amp;x=-348&amp;y=-71 ) . 
  that means at just one kilometre it 'll take almost 3 seconds . 
  vietnam has n't fully converted to polymer . 
  only notes from 10,000 and up are made of polymer . 
  the 1,000 , 2,000 , and 5,000 ( as well as the notes lower than 1,000 , but i do n't think they issue those anymore ) are all still paper . 
  edit : found out you copied and pasted from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polymer_banknote#adoption_of_polymer_banknotes ) . 
  worth noting that the section in question has an { { unreferenced section } } template . 
  try / r/games for that kind of stuff . 
  the colours are great , because it means you can very easily distinguish the notes at a glance . 
  they 're also all different sizes so you can tell them apart blind ( obviously this one requires specifically training for it ) , but i think most countries do that . 
  [ this top level comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1v13kv/laundering_money_literally_could_save_billions_of/cenp2s1 ) is probably what i should 've linked to , on second thought , but i just thought / u/nolan1971 's comment thread felt more drama-y . 
  might be a fair point in theory , but australia has been using these notes for over 20 years now and i do n't think i 've ever heard of note fading being an issue . 
  this from a country well-known for having higher than average exposure to uv ( due to both low latitude and thinned ozone layer ) . 
  i ca n't find it right now , but someone elsewhere in the thread pointed out that yes , standard paper is actually a polymer , strictly speaking . 
  oh yeah , the last one is a setting somewhere . 
  it 's not on by default . 
  i think i 've received emails there maybe twice since the switchover , though . 
  fair point . 
  i always get them and do n't know how to get rid of the damn things . 
  what ? 
  that 's a bit rich . 
  i made a few clarifications regarding vietnamese money and some terminology , and one comment with a simple statement about the state of australian banknotes . 
  hardly `` directly involved in the drama '' . 
  more like tangentially related . 
  i strived to make the title as neutral as possible . 
  i 'm curious , what if he fired a blank ? 
  i figure that would kill you too , but what if he had something in his mouth that protected him , like a thin plate of metal or leather or something ? 
  dc and marvel are pretty good at this , too . 
  i did n't notice that one !, 
  clever . 
  exposure is brightness . 
  saturation is how colourful it is . 
  turn saturation all the way down and it 's greyscale/black and white . 
  i assume by `` unreadable '' you 're referring to the fact that they look like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/rtbjbhn ) after a few days ? 
  it 's so bad that i was n't sure what you were talking about at first . 
  i was just thinking , `` where is there * any * date displayed ? 
  honestly ncis is my favourite one of the crime shows . 
  yeah it 's completely unrealistic and stupid , but to me the characters are just awesome and entertaining . 
  that 's what i watch it for . 
  and that 's also why i do n't watch ncis la. 
  the characters are just cringe-worthy . 
   the us political spectrum compared to the rest of the world is n't relevant to the claim, 
  yes , it is . 
  that 's the entire point of the claim ; to point out that politics in the us are far right of what most of the rest of the world is . 
  compare the us with western european countries , australia and new zealand , and canada . 
  all these countries have robust healthcare , stronger wage and employment laws , and more social security . 
  i 'm curious as to what you mean by `` small ` l' libertarian '' . 
  do you mean you hold similar beliefs to the libertarian party , but do not necessarily agree with them enough to call yourself libertarian ? 
  or perhaps you are libertarian on the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) , which means you believe in free social policies -- it does n't make a claim either way about economics , you can be libertarian right ( typical `` libertarian '' ) or libertarian left ? 
  or something else ? 
  speaking as an outsider , it seems to me that it would make sense to switch to irv for presidential elections and senate elections ( you pick one winner per state per election , right ? 
  ) , and either follow the current australian model of irv for house of reps elections , or even better use an stv variation of that , as laid out [ in this video by john cleese ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
   a us politician 's leanings can be plotted on that spectrum even if no other countries existed . 
  that is correct , and the claim is that the us sits , in an absolute sense , pretty far right , with the obvious implication that it is also right of most other countries . 
  both of these statements are true .
