   as i just said officer , no comment, 
  this is * so * important . 
  the guy in the video that was shared the other day was being a dick . 
  not because he would n't answer questions , but because he was being rude about it . 
  simply say something like `` no comment '' or `` i do n't want to answer any questions '' , and be on your way . 
  do n't be like the other guy . 
  same goes with the camera . 
  politely let them know you 're recording the conversation at the start , and after that keep it out of the way and unobtrusive . 
  by all means , record it , but do n't be a dick about it . 
  do you know if they 're planning os x and linux versions ? 
   well you keep using `` lol '' at random so i do n't have much faith for you . 
  i laughed at that more than i probably should 've . 
  because you were n't smart enough to use incognito mode . 
  but why would soul silver be expensive ? 
  are ruby and sapphire expensive ? 
  diamond and pearl ? 
  black and white ? 
   relate to anyone `` in charge '' of a vehicle and not only those actively driving one . 
  other than the open licence holder in charge of the vehicle when a learner driver is behind the wheel , what situations can that apply ? 
  just curious . 
  laws like that are shit . 
  i really ca n't see how any good would come of it . 
  while that 's technically true , they are completely separate from most forms of anarchism , and actually generally hold an view completely opposite from most other forms of anarchism . 
  sure they technically believe in the removal of a state , which is what anarchism technically means , but referring to ancaps as being `` anarchists '' is misleading . 
  they are n't the same thing , but they are very similar . 
  anarcho-capitalism is , essentially , taking the ideology of libertarianism to its extreme ( as though it was n't already an `` extreme '' viewpoint ) . 
   while marijuana may or may not be a gateway drug , according to the national institute of drug abuse , marijuana users are more than 104 times more likely to use cocaine than those who have never smoked marijuana, 
  does that study have details specifically on places where it is legal ? 
  i would posit that the reason this is true is that marijuana acts as a gateway drug because it starts you doing something illegal . 
  you 're already doing one illegal thing , already have a relationship with a dealer etc. , so going one more step is easy . 
  if it were legal , i would suggest , this would not be the case , and it would not act as a gateway drug . 
   while its use may be relatively harmless to adults , it can have a number of damaging effects to the health of a developing mind , being linked to mental health issues , lower intelligence, 
  the solution to this is quite simple , maintain very strict policies for those under 18 . 
  of course , just like today , some kids under 18 will smoke and drink , but create laws that make it * extremely * tough on the people supplying the kids with drugs , and it becomes less of an issue . 
  as far as i 'm aware , underage smoking is not currently a major problem . 
   increased cases of dui, 
  same deal . 
  just keep enforcement up . 
  equip standard breathalyser tests to also test for marijuana , and have penalties for this on par with those for drink driving . 
  but anyway , the most important argument in favour of legalisation is that someone should be able to make their own choices for how they live their life , so long as it is n't affecting other people . 
  just because it * can * be abused , does n't mean it should n't be allowed to be done in a responsible way . 
  if that were not true , alcohol should be banned , and so , frankly , should * driving * . 
  ninjaedit : just for context , i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana , and i do n't drink very much , either . 
  i just think others should be allowed to if the want . 
  if a student simply is n't intelligent , then their opinions matter . 
  but if they are simply hostile to the idea of learning . 
  if they do n't * try * to learn , then no , i do n't particularly think their opinion is of much importance . 
  of course , it becomes difficult , because perhaps they did n't try to learn specifically because their teachers were so unengaging . 
  so perhaps it 's their own fault , but perhaps not entirely . 
   i also think recess should be brought back, 
  my understanding from american tv shows is that `` recess '' is their term for what i 've always called `` break '' or `` lunch '' . 
  do american schools no longer give kids this ? 
   there is no universally agreed plural of `` platypus '' in the english language . 
  scientists generally use `` platypuses '' or simply `` platypus '' . 
  colloquially , the term `` platypi '' is also used for the plural , although this is technically incorrect and a form of pseudo-latin ; the correct greek plural would be `` platypodes '' . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platypus ) ], 
  so platypuses , platypus , and platypodes are all perfectly fine . 
  you can use platypi if you really want , but be prepared for people to judge you . 
  platypies , though , is a word you just made up . 
  what sort of peasant games on a laptop ? 
  yeah , it needs a tiny amount of straightening , but the increased contrast ( which is all that the enhancement seems to be , to me ) was absolutely essential , too . 
  the image was way too flat before . 
  i find a small increase in contrast is necessary in most digital photos . 
  my desktop is still on xp . 
  granted , i have n't used it in a year ( gave it to a friend to fix , have n't gotten it back yet ) , but even then xp was old . 
  it 's nothing to do with stubbornness or preferring xp or anything like that , it 's just laziness . 
  when i get it back , i 'll buy a new hard drive ( current one is only 160 gb ) and stick win8 on it . 
  the rest of the hardware is pretty decent ( 9800 gt , 3.16 ghz dual core , 4 gb ram ) , so it 'll last me a little while yet , even if it wo n't be playing all the latest and greatest games .

  does n't matter , they 're going to require you use a proper certified calculator for exams . 
  but then there 's my uni , where most courses require a calculator that is n't even graphical ... sigh ... 
  casio fx-100au . 
  because that 's the most advanced calculator most courses at my uni will allow ... still use my ti-89 from highschool whenever i can , though . 
  . edu, 
  yeah , many of the things they want to test are `` is it possible that x can happen in y conditions '' . 
  for that , you only need to show it happening once to make a conclusion . 
  cooper ? 
  where 's that come from . 
  i suggest we name it froid 's law . 
  i selected, 
   like ` doe ' with a soft ` g ' as in ` giant ' at the end . 
  because it was close enough to how i pronounce it , but it is n't quite accurate . 
  a more accurate representation would be / do\u028a\u0292 / , or `` doe with a soft ` g ' as in ` beige ' at the end '' . 
  i selected this rather than going with `` other '' simply because i think most people would have done the same . 
  i do n't know of anyone that actually pronounces it with the same ` g ' as ` giant ' . 
  that 's a physically awkward sound to make in the situation . 
  honestly i wish more people would use ipa , it 's not particularly difficult . 
  anyway , yours is the same pronunciation i use . 
  i selected `` like ` doe ' with a soft ` g ' as in ` giant ' at the end '' , though , because it 's very similar . 
  no , it does n't matter . 
  but that 's not the way the media chose to present it , and the people chose to trust the media when they should n't have , and now we 're stuck with abbott for at least 3 years . 
  are you kidding ? 
  australia ( like many countries ) is fucking * owned * by motorists . 
  i 'd like to see more concentration on public transport infrastructure and bikeways instead of toll roads and shit hardly anybody uses . 
  ninjaedit : but honestly , this is more of a state thing than federal , i believe . 
  edit : i just realised this sounds a bit hypocritical . 
  the idea should be to encourage more environmentally friendly activities and ( in the case of bikeways ) a more active lifestyle , by making these options more feasible for a person to use : regular public transportation with wider coverage , and more bike paths . 
  because less pollution and more active lifestyles are good for people .
