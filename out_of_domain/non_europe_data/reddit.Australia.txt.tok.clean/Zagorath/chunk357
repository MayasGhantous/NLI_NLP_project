   once they start to die off , the political landscape not only in this state , but at a federal level will start to change dramatically, 
  i hope you 're ~ ~ right ~ ~ correct , but i ca n't help but fear it is n't entirely true . 
  the amount of young australians i 've heard bitching about how bad juliar [ sic ] gillard was frightens me a little . 
  young australians are almost as complacent and media influenced as their parents . 
  that was my point . 
  the us has a lot of cultural difference across the country . 
  definitely not nearly as much as between separate countries in the eu , and probably not even as much as * within * some of the european countries , but the comparison is still there to be made . 
  hell yeah food is a right . 
  if you ca n't afford to buy food what happens ? 
  there are government programmes that help you with it . 
  edit : actually , to an extent , there 's agreement worldwide on what is and is n't a right . 
  [ the universal declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ ) is something nearly every major country has agreed upon , and includes this clause :, 
   everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care and necessary social services , and the right to security in the event of unemployment , sickness , disability , widowhood , old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control . 
  when something can be definitely proven to be false , but people are allowed to continue spouting it on national broadcast media , that is a lie , and should not be allowed . 
  it 's not ` picking and choosing what is `` truth '' ' , in cases where something is opinion , or could potentially be true , then it should be allowed as such , but presenting outright lies , like claiming that there is significant evidence that vaccines cause autism , should be illegal , especially as it is not only fraudulent , but dangerous . 
  right , but you still hear stories about how people ca n't afford important treatments or medicines , and how that takes a serious toll on their life . 
  those sorts of things occasionally come out of australia or the uk , but are much , much less common , because we have a healthcare system designed to actually help make sure people have access to good healthcare when they need it . 
  and `` have access to '' \u2260 `` are able to get it if you can afford to pay large amounts for it '' . 
  touch\u00e9, 
   this , however does not exempt them from getting a bill for those services . 
  and when they ca n't afford it ? 
  what happens then ? 
   universal care is not the solution to our problems, 
  it might not be the * only * solution to it . 
  other solutions may very well work . 
  but it * is * a solution that has been * proven * to work in many , many , other countries , and there 's no reasonable reason that it would n't also work in the us if implemented properly ( which will be virtually impossible to do given the convoluted political system in the us , with states holding so much power , and also due to the strong influence of the right wing ) . 
   and while it 's a shame that people do that -- it 's imperative that we allow that right . 
  no it 's not . 
   truth will naturally triumph over lies . 
  no , it does n't . 
  as evidenced by the popularity of fox news and rush limbaugh . 
  i 'll repeat what i said one more time . 
  it 's not about legislating what is and is n't truth , only about preventing statements which can be * proven * to be false . 
  let 's not go around trivialising bankruptcy like that . 
  i do n't know quite enough about the aca to make a well-reasoned judgement , although i will admit that what little i have seen of it makes me think it seems better than the previous system , even if not much . 
  fair enough . 
  like i said , i did n't know all that much about it . 
   is it similar to the google search app on androids ? 
  like with those cards that show your interests , weather , traffic , etc. ? 
  not similar , that literally * is * what google now is . 
  if you read that more carefully , you 'll see that while australia was connected to new guinea , it was still not possible to walk all the way from australia to the indochinese peninsula . 
  it is believed that while some would have gone by boat to new guinea and walked across , some others came directly by boat . 
  the important point is that / u/shenko-wolf was correct . 
  `` australia was never connected to asia by land al [ l ] the way . '', 
  ninjaedit : i wrote this up before seeing your edit . 
  does anyone else think that / r/theredpill should be auto-marked as `` low hanging fruit '' ? 
  [ i usually recommend people do n't rearrange keys ] ( https://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) . 
  tl ; dr , it encourages bad habits . 
  that was a brilliant line , and he delivered it so well , but in all seriousness , french films are fantastic . 
  [ jean de florette ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_de_florette ) is probably one of my favourite films of all time . 
  the film [ le concert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_concert ) is brilliantly hilarious and heartwarming at the same time ( and especially good if you 're a music nerd ) . 
  and [ the french film that inspired ~ ~ 40-year-old virgin ~ ~ failure to launch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanguy_ ( film \\ ) ) is much better than it 's american counterpart . 
  yeah that 's true . 
  i probably should have said `` many '' are fantastic , or even more accurately `` most of the films that a native english speaker is likely to encounter '' are fantastic . 
  thanks for calling me out on that . 
  by the way , does anyone remember exactly which episode this is in ? 
  i kinda wan na rewatch it . 
  i 'm thinking season 1 or 2 . 
  nah do n't worry about it , you were absolutely right . 
  cheers for the episode number . 
  shit they did that ? 
  i dumped it for \u00b5torrent a while before that happened , after i got sick of it loading up their own fancy interface by default rather than the actual list of torrents i 've downloaded . 
  plus all the bloaty `` sharing '' features and media stuff that it did . 
  \u00b5torrent is what i use , but i would n't say it 's as good as the old windows version . 
  it runs fairly slowly when opening up and closing down , the latter of which is particularly a problem when you want to shut the computer down . 
  if you do n't manually quit out of it first , i 've found it can mess up the `` reopen windows when logging back in '' feature . 
  edit : by the way , if you 're on a mac , you can easily type \u00b5torrent with the proper mu symbol by pressing option-m . ( m for mu , or `` micro '' , which is what the symbol means in this context . ), 
  just a handy tip . 
  come to think of it , that 's probably correct . 
  we watched it in my french class , and i remember the teacher saying that it was the inspiration for an american film , but i did n't actually remember which one it was , specifically . 
   flickr offers a terabyte of free storage, 
  damn , that 's a shame ... when did they start limiting it like that ? 
  used to be unlimited , but you could only upload a certain amount per month . 
  in their defence , a hell of a lot of people do n't seem to understand that difference . 
  when writing these things it 's super important to get capitalisation correct , because m vs m is a huge difference , as is b vs b. 
  but people do n't pay attention to their capitalisation properly , and things get confusing . 
  damn , it 's like upload speed and download speed are inversely proportional ... 
  shit that gif was high quality . 
  loaded really well , too . 
  was able to watch it completely smoothly , albeit at a slower speed than on the second time round ( when it was already loaded ) . 
  actually , it could be anywhere from 16,666.67 to 166,666.50 each , so it could be 5 or 6 figures each . 
  yeah it 's never worked for me either . 
  apparently they do n't support any stores outside of the united states , which would explain things . 
  in those people 's defence , the app specifically mentions that it supports stores in canada , the us , and the uk . 
  and yet , [ by the developer 's own admission , it actually does n't support anything outside of the us ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1vjj51/i_am_one_of_the_developers_of_a_popular_chrome/cet2slt?context=1 ) . 
  if i were in canada or the uk , and i repeatedly was unable to find any coupons , then i would feel justified in rating the app low for falsely advertising its utility . 
  see , this is why we should call it lang park . 
  i 've got the steam keys for all three fear games from the humble bundle a while back . 
  i do n't actually have any interest in playing them , if anyone 's got anything they wan na trade i 'd be happy to . 
  man , it 's been ages since i 've even considered buying a game at a brick and mortar store in australia . 
  i forgot that they can sometimes have reasonable prices . 
  i just ca n't believe you ca n't get between brisbane and the gold coast airport by train . 
  i think the important difference is the way the other characters react to it . 
  with pierce they always call him out on how awful he 's being , but with shirley it 's just accepted . 
  sometimes britta will call her out on her religious views , but never anyone else , and a lot of the time she 's just let be . 
   an increasingly open-minded and un-relatedly , agnostic, 
  i get what you 're doing there , but let 's be honest . 
  it * is n't * unrelated . 
  studies quite strongly show a negative relationship between intelligence and religious belief . 
  that 's not to say that all religious people are less intelligent and more close-minded than all atheists , that would be an absurd claim to make .
