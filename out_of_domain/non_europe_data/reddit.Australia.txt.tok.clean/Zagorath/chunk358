  but it is to say that the overall trend is that people who are more intelligent and have had more education are more likely to not be religious .

  my understanding is that in australia , you 're legally required to be covered by insurance in order to do work . 
  the only reason uq requires it is because the law requires it . 
  i 'm doing my experience overseas ( in a country without strict labour laws ) , unpaid . 
  i talked to someone at the engineering faculty who said the 30 day thing is only an issue because of the insurance thing . 
  but anyway , chances are doing your work overseas is n't really an option for you , so i would suggest doing it in two years . 
  you need 60 days total , if you ca n't get paid work , do 30 days one year , and 30 days the next . 
  it 's calendar year , so you could theoretically do half of it in november/december this year , and then do the rest in january/february 2015 . 
  are you talking about the f # and g in the altissimo range ? 
  or the clarion register ? 
  if you mean the altissimo range , there are a number of different possible fingerings that you can use . 
  i 'd suggest looking up an online finger chart and finding out what works for you . 
  what works for one person/clarinet combo wo n't necessarily work for another combination , not to mention you can pick what works best for the specific piece ( what notes come before and after it ) . 
  people keep saying that one . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  there 's two pages , either way , one page is going to hurt . 
  which one depends on the hand you use .

  i never had desks like that . 
  i 've only ever used normal desks like [ this one ] ( http://www.clker.com/cliparts/d/y/m/t/u/v/an-office-desk.svg ) , only without the draws underneath . 
  two people to a desk . 
  i find uni `` desks '' more problematic , but not much . 
  agree . 
  the ones i 've seen were n't like in that image . 
  they swing down . 
  still clearly right handed , but like i said , not too much of a problem . 
  i 've never liked art class anyway . 
  i 'm more of a muso . 
  never been a problem for me . 
  lefty gloves on the rare occasion we did baseball/softball/rounders were never any worse than the righty ones . 
  it was an advantage in fencing since i basically had a glove to myself . 
  i grew up using scissors right-handed . 
  yeah , no kidding . 
  i hate writing . 
  yeah , i used ballpoint pens with the smallest point i could get ( 0.5 mm , if i remember correctly ) , and it was never an issue . 
  your what now ? 
  never been a problem to me . 
  i hate 'em because they 're messy , and to be honest i do n't see the advantage in using them , even if you could get one that dries quickly and was less messy . 
  at least you guys * have * an amazon store . 
  amazon.com.au only came into existence late last year , and it only sells kindles and ebooks . 
  i 'd have called them all leads . 
  that is , all the ones pictured in this subreddit 's header , or all the ones in the opening sequence of the show .

  william hurt is a famous actor . 
  as far as i know , there 's nothing more to know about it . 
  it 's just because the other two lines ended with `` until your [ something ] hurt '' , and it makes use of the fact that william hurt 's last name is a homonym , and also that * your * and * you 're * are homophones . 
  i like how large `` wikibot '' is . 
  i 'm a lefty and i 'm going to start saying this just randomly . 
   the side we choose to suckle our thumb on in the womb decides if we are left or right handed . 
  when there are twins , the space is more confined so you usually end up with a left and right handed baby,

  ie 7 was when things started improving a little . 
  let 's make them use ie 6 . 
  no , i do n't actually . 
  i was just playing off of the `` pc master race '' stereotype , and going one step further . 
  in fact , i game on a laptop sometimes . 
  my laptop 's a mac , so my options are limited and i do most of my serious gaming on my desktop , but there 's definitely nothing wrong with gaming on a laptop . 
  i was going to do it as obviously and as sinisterly ( pun intended ) as i can , but i think i like your idea better . 
  / r/learnprogramming is a good place to start . 
  from there you can be pointed to a bunch of other good resources . 
   have a few good simple but engaging questions prepared for any given conversation, 
  got any good examples ? 
  what i meant was that it was the start of ie getting better after ie 6 , not that ie 7 was actually an especially * great * browser . 
  actually , it 's more of a `` here '' right , if you 're speaking as an american in america . 
  edit : for clarity , he 's fixed the typo , but it originally said `` if a child does n't want to do it , that 's there right . '', 
   i think of this map which compares the size of u.s. states by area, 
  as someone from a country that 's only a tad smaller than the contiguous states , it always amazes me to see these maps and see just how tiny european countries are , geographically . 
  haha no worries mate , it was kinda amusing . 
  the country most similar to america as far as i 'm aware would be australia . 
  australian states have quite substantial political power ( though not to the same kinda ridiculous degree us states do ) , and have a lot of importance in terms of culture and sports . 
  but many , many , other countries have states . 
  off the top of my head , germany does , india does ( as / u/fnord _ happy said ) , brazil does , and so does mexico ( which is actually officially titled `` the united mexican states '' in the same way `` america '' is officially titled `` the united states of america ) . 
  / r/shitxsays is almost guaranteed to be a pathetic subreddit . 
  / r/shitstatistssay is almost scarily bad . 
  still really common in eastern asia ( specifically korea , china , and the indochinese peninsula ) , too . 
  that 's the worst part of it .

  you know what i never got ? 
  the 5 rings on the flag are supposed to represent the `` 5 inhabited continents '' , but coubertin was french , and i 'm fairly sure france usually teaches a 7 continent model , which would mean there should have been 6 rings . 
  since it seems he was using a 6 continent model , i 'm wondering which 6 continent model he used . 
  was it one in which eurasia is a single continent , or in which the americas are a single continent ? 
  based on the title i assume it was on the wall of the chemistry department of his school . 
  but write every sentence as a separate comment replied to the last . 
  more opportunities for a single person to downvote you . 
  i do n't think the english perception of american english is quite as bad as the french perception of canadian french . 
  that post was the * definition * of constructive criticism ( figuratively speaking ) . 
  i believe many surveys will add in a random question like that to test if the survey taker is actually paying attention/is not a bot . 
  if it 's not that , then i 'm stumped . 
  yeah definitely . 
  i often forget to check my rss reader for a while , and i get extra excited if i see 2 or 3 new comics . 
  ah thanks . 
  i learnt french , but i guess my french teachers used the 7 continent model for convenience in teaching people who were mostly used to that model . 
  i did a little more research , and came up with some interesting titbits :, 
   the seven-continent model is usually taught in china and most english-speaking countries . 
  the six-continent combined-eurasia model is preferred by the geographic community , russia , the former states of the ussr , and japan . 
  the six-continent combined-america model is taught in latin america , and most parts of europe including germany , greece , italy , portugal and spain . 
  this model may be taught to include only the five inhabited continents ( excluding antarctica ) -- as depicted in the olympic logo . 
  although , admittedly , [ yahoo answers ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100916170019aafys8u ) is hardly the most reliable source .
