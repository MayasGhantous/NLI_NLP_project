  b = byte , b = bit . 
  m = mega , m = milli , g = giga , g does n't have a meaning . 
  the capitalisation can make big differences in what you mean , so you do need to be careful about it . 
  i really hope you meant mbps , because if it 's really mbps i feel so sorry for you . 
  haha i know . 
  i 'm aussie too . 
  i was just bringing it up because the capitalisation can make a huge difference in the meaning . 
  seeing people just casually throw out mbps when they probably mean mbps , but might mean mbps , or any other combination of m/m and b/b can cause confusion , so it 's absolutely imperative that one use correct capitalisation . 
  the lack of earth and the ordering is explained by the fact that he was n't using astronomy , he was using astrology . 
  the planets are apparently in that order in astrology . 
  it 's also the order of their distance from earth . 
  fun fact about pluto , though , it was actually discovered during his lifetime , after he had written the rest of the planets . 
  he flat out refused to write a movement for it , because he felt that the planets suite had overshadowed his other work that he thought was superior . 
  guess he got the last laugh in the end , though . 
  he did n't do earth because he was using astrology . 
  he did n't originally do pluto because it had n't been discovered at the time . 
  it was later discovered in his lifetime , but he did n't write a movement because he did n't like how the planets had overshadowed his other works . 
  he got the last laugh , though , because pluto is n't even classified as a planet anymore . 
  yeah , they 're in the astrological order , as opposed to the actual order from the sun . 
  it lines up with their distance from earth . 
  wait really ? 
  a bunch of those a moons of jupiter . 
  were they considered planets at some time ? 
  fun fact : yes it is . 
  it 's all the planets , and also minor planet 134340 pluto . 
  i 've mentioned that in a few other places , but yeah , the order is n't the same . 
  but still , that does n't mean it 'd be bad as album art . 
  it definitely gets the point across . 
  [ i think this cadbury favourites ad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbjiaad1xey ) is perhaps one of the most genius slogans any brand has come up with . 
  ca n't speak for the uk , but australian posties usually ride on a motorbike . 
  i think rubbish trucks might have their wheels on the left , though . 
  ( we drive on the left , too . ), 
  pretty sure rubbish trucks have their wheels on the left side . 
  i 've heard of this tip before , and i 've never heard of jim jeffries . 
  thank you for being a good person . 
  smokers who drop their cigarettes on the floor absolutely disgust me . 
  i really hope you 're being sarcastic there . 
  the sheer gall of smokers just dropping their cigarettes everywhere and acting as though it 's perfectly fine . 
  last time i saw a thread like this come up heaps of them came to defend their actions . 
  if you 're a smoker and you do n't do this , thank you so much for being a decent human being . 
   four-letter words go on the left and five on the right, 
  i like this tip , but i 'm going to change `` right '' to `` your dominant hand '' and `` left '' to `` your other hand '' . 
  because some of us are left handed and use knives in the left hand . 
   the fork should always point down and not be used like a spoon, 
  yeah fuck this . 
  for many foods it 's so much easier to point the tines upward , and i 'm going to eat that way . 
  it does n't make anyone uncomfortable unless they are specifically looking for people who are n't following arbitrary etiquette `` rules '' . 
  the napkin thing is much the same . 
  the rest of your tips are great . 
  ah fair enough . 
  do you guys not have those in the us ? 
   even if they 're six years old, 
  that just makes you an arsehole . 
  it 's not your job to teach other people 's kids . 
  yeah it really is . 
  although it sometimes is written with a \u02da sign , rankine is an absolute scale , and thus should really just be written r , without the degrees . 
  i had n't heard anything about paying for costs , but yeah i was under the impression that they were officially endorsing it , at the least . 
  at the talk we were supposed to go to pre-o week last year for first year engineers , we were introduced to uqrota and told by staff that it 's the best way to work out our timetables . 
  some ui points :, 
  * [ the dropdown semester option ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ru2br#4 ) could use some rejiggering . 
  at the moment it kinda seems like every second option is greyed out , rather than just being different colours to easily differentiate them . 
  * [ the calendar thing at the top ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ru2br#0 ) says `` 10th '' . 
  what 's that for ? 
  i 'd suggest either having it update with the current date or some other useful information , or having it not really display anything at all ( maybe just an arbitrary calendar sorta like [ this ] ( http://jwmhs.pasco.k12.fl.us/wp-content/uploads/jwmhs/2013/11/calendar.png ) . 
  * [ the pencil on the word `` timetable '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ru2br#1 ) should be clickable to select the full title . 
  i was clicking it at first and confused that it did n't do anything , before realising that it 's only their to indicate that you can edit the title by selecting it . 
  * it 'd be nice to be able to [ select sessions from a drop down menu , similar to uqrota ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ru2br#2 ) . 
  * i really like the overall look and feel of it , it feels like a metro application . 
  and the clear bright red clash indication is super useful . 
  i also like the ability to click straight onto the `` course information '' . 
  * that said , i personally find the variety in use of colour on uqrota makes it feel easier to arrange things . 
  * i absolutely love the ability to save multiple versions . 
  * your [ screenshots down below the actual app ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ru2br#3 ) make it seem like there 's a stand-alone app ( at least on ios and mac os x ) . 
  is that true ? 
  if not , perhaps it 'd be best for the screenshots to show the address bar to alleviate confusion ? 
  a couple of feature requests :, 
  * i 'd love to be able to share the calendar with others ( in a read-only way ) , specifically people who * are n't * at uq . 
  * it 'd be awesome if it could export to google calendars as well as ical . 
  this feature alone would be enough for me to instantly start using this over uqrota . 
  i have no idea if it 's actually possible/feasible , but if it is that 'd be the killer feature for me . 
  awesome job with it so far , though . 
  most of the ui points i brought up were honestly just nitpicking , and the app is incredible . 
  edit : actually , i just noticed it seems you have a bug . 
  the `` all weeks '' option displays classes at the correct times , but any subsequent weeks seem to be showing them all three hours too early . 
  as an australian , i never see anything in imperial or us measurements except at subway ( thanks / u/groomingfluid , it would n't have even occurred to me otherwise ) and when talking to americans online . 
  we even use kilojoules as the measurement of energy in food . 
  when saying where you live , do you go state , city , country ? 
  no , you 'll usually go city , state , country , or if it 's written as an address , country , state , city . 
  mixing the scale of units like that is completely illogical . 
  not necessarily . 
  most people would pronounce them the same , but some people pronounce tonne / t\u0252n / ( rhymes with john ) . 
  i do n't see them as any different from each other . 
  you 're conveying information about a particular place or time , and in each case you have different systems for different levels of granularity . 
   the ical is technically not an apple ical feed but a standard icalendar feed, 
  oh awesome . 
  i 'll have to figure out how to get that to work , thanks !, 
  in the past i 've just clicked on it and it tries to launch apple 's ical . 
  i 'm on chrome 33.0.1750.29 beta in os x mavericks . 
  that 's correct , levels of granularity are n't uniform . 
  i still fail to see how that 's important .
