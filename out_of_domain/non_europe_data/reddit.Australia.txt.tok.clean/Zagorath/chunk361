  regardless of exactly what you call the different areas , the point is that you have a number of different levels , and you say them in a specific order , going from either smallest level of granularity to largest , or vice versa , depending on the situation . 
  you do n't mix and match . 
  huh , interesting . 
  not even in subway stations or what have you ? 
  [ they 're really handy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/tactile_paving_in_singapore.jpg ) . 
  just tried it out in safari 7.0.1 as well as firefox 26.0 , still doing the same thing . 
  ~ ~ i 'm wondering if perhaps it 's the data at the back end that 's the problem ? 
  i 'm not sure how exactly it works , but maybe uq has them all stored incorrectly for my courses ? ~ ~, 
  edit : you know what ? 
  the fact that it 's 3 hours is too much of a coincidence . 
  i 'm not in australia at the moment , i 'm at utc +7 ( queensland is utc +10 ) . 
  perhaps it 's adjusting for my time zone when it should n't be ? 
  this is gon na sound kinda snarky , but it 's not meant that way . 
  i 'm just curious , what 's the advantage of your app ? 
  aside from being designed to work well on ios , does it offer any functionality above that offered by uqrota ? 
  yeah i just figured that out . 
  thanks !, 
  if anyone else is wondering , it 's : click on the arrow next to `` other calendars '' , click `` add by url '' , and paste in the url you copied from the ical icon . 
  now that you mention it , that 's another feature / u/doug-from-its 's app could use . 
  i do n't see the rooms listed anywhere on the actual app , although it [ is there in the ical feed ] ( http://imgur.com/ubjejbk ) . 
  it 'd also be nice to be able to change building numbers into names , either automatically or by allowing custom naming . 
  edit : as a side note , i doubt you have to worry about it cutting into your market * too ** much . 
  most students are already aware of uqrota , and if they 're using your app it 's probably because it works better on their iphones , which this app wo n't change . 
  editedit : as an extra sidenote , i just went to the google play store to see if your app was in there , and searching for `` uq '' came up with [ this ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ag_3.radiation ) result . 
  should we be worried ? 
  that 's true , but it does n't mean we ca n't take reasonable precautions to avoid people getting spoiled . 
  if the host gave the go-ahead , then go ahead , especially if the food needs to be eaten hot . 
  as a side note , this is entirely a cultural thing . 
  in asia the whole `` wait until everyone is served '' thing just does n't exist . 
  we * were * almost completely unaffected by the gfc . 
  but that was for a few reasons . 
  the biggest is our exports to china , but it 's also partly due to well-placed stimulus of the economy . 
  that costs money , and so the government went into debt . 
  unfortunately , most people do n't understand that for a government to go into debt during an economic downturn is a * good thing * ( or , at least , it is n't * necessarily * a bad thing ) . 
  it means they 're ( they * may be * ) responding appropriately . 
  and so the right-wing media , combined with people 's ignorance of economics , lead people to fear that the government was managing the economy poorly . 
  but also not all the employees are going to be handling tickets for 40 hours a week . 
  he overestimated on both sides . 
  he does n't do a lot of mainstream gaming stuff , but [ blunty3000 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/blunty3000 ) is absolutely incredible . 
  he 's not afraid to call a company out on their shit when they 're being shit , but at the same time he can be gushing if a product actually is good ( [ unlike some australian journalists involved with gaming ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation ) ) . 
  he 's been my go to for unbiased reviews for a long time now . 
  australia ( currently -- there 's rumours our new right-wing government wants to change it ) has a really good system . 
  you get an interest-free * loan from the government , and you only have to pay it off once you actually enter the work force . 
  that said , the cost of uni for an australian in australia is significantly less than it would be for a us citizen to go to most universities there . 
  \\* indexed to inflation, 
  no , that was n't the `` clear implication '' . 
  if you got that impression , that is because that is what * you * were reading into it . 
  i meant nothing by it other than that people who have had more education ( and are thus more intelligent ) have a higher chance of being non-religious . 
  which is what i said . 
  i was , in fact , quite careful with my words to not specify anything other than that , meaning you have to be * looking * to interpret it some other way in order to do so . 
  i simplified things a little . 
  it would have been more accurate to say that the abbott government is looking at selling off the current debt to third parties , although what the implications of this would be with regards to having to pay interest , and whether or not it would involve getting rid of hecs down the line completely , are unknown . 
  holy shit , that just kept on going . 
  abbrevi8 's an interesting fellow in / r/australia . 
  he goes back and forth between acting the troll , and trying to present a well-reasoned right-wing argument ( something that is very rare in / r/australia -- virtually every other right-wing poster is definitively trolling ) . 
  do n't apologise for the hdr look . 
  hdr can be bad when it 's used badly , but it does n't have to be a bad thing , and can look fantastic when it 's done well . 
  ( see : trey ratcliff for an example of good hdr ) . 
  regardless , i thought this was a fantastic photo , although it is quite noticeably a phone picture . 
  the only criticism i would give is the composition on the left edge . 
  i find it best to cut off shapes like trees roughly in the middle , because it looks odd if you let them curve over and odd gaps like in the very top left corner . 
  i 'd crop it a little bit from the top and the left . 
  actually that 's a good point . 
  i find him very reasonable whenever it 's not something related to sex/sexism . 
  i 've not looked into it , but i imagine there 's some clause preventing that . 
  honestly i think making it a felony is a bit much , but severe fines should apply . 
  actually 112 is the worldwide gsm emergency number . 
  it 'll connect you to 000 in australia , 911 in america ( if you 're not on that weird cdma thing they have over there ) , as well as being the standard number in many european and asian countries .

  it 's a common children 's song , [ there was an old lady who swallowed a fly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/there_was_an_old_lady_who_swallowed_a_fly ) . 
  and like [ so many ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humpty_dumpty ) [ children 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it's_raining,_it's_pouring ) [ songs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ring_a_ring_o'_roses ) , it 's rather morbid . 
  as someone who has n't read the tos , could you point to the bit that says this would n't be allowed ? 
  i feel like if you bought something and did n't receive what you payed for , then they should have no grounds upon which to do that . 
  i 'm assuming he meant cheaper than logmein . 
  just a friendly tip , i do n't think you 're using `` in lieu of '' correctly . 
  the phrase means `` instead of '' or `` in the absence of '' , but it seems like you 're using it to mean `` with respect to '' . 
   from a moral standpoint , they too should be holding logmeins feet to the fire, 
  exactly . 
  so contact them and let them know what logmein did wrong , and give them a chance to hold their feet to the fire . 
  glass has a giant red flashing dot when it 's recording . 
  if that was n't going , then probable cause does n't exist . 
  if they do n't know that , they really should n't be going around arresting people for it , because they do n't understand nearly enough to be making that call . 
  a fair point , but the light 's placement means it would be really obvious if it was being covered . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are specific fair use laws in the us that allow you to do that . 
  ^ ^ why ^ ^ do ^ ^ you ^ ^ always ^ ^ put ^ ^ a ^ ^ space ^ ^ before ^ ^ your ^ ^ commas ? 
  you also would n't say `` in lieu of not having '' , because `` in lieu of '' * means * `` not having '' . 
  oh you , 
  or their mvnos ( companies that resell their network , usually at a better price ) , like ting . 
  i have to be honest , i never really understood cdma . 
  it does n't use sims , right ? 
  in that case , how do you switch carriers ? 
  ( from one cdma to another , obviously , since you wo n't be able to work on at&t or t-mobile 's gsm networks . ), 
  i think saying that you need a revolution is taking things a * little * too far , but i agree with your sentiment . 
  the biggest problem with the eragon dragon was the mouth . 
  they gave it a horrible mouth that made it look like a gorilla , rather than having a proper dragon snout . 
  yeah , i actually knew all of that . 
  i simplified my explanation because it helped get the point across . 
  but still , you worded all that much better than i could have , so well done . 
  yep , works exactly as expected now .
