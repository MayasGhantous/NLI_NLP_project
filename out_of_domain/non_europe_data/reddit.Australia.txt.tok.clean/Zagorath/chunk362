  thanks !, 
  yes , they do . 
  google glass has a light that goes on that clearly shows when it is recording . 
  that would be the [ baader-meinhof phenomenen ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/ ) at work . 
  queensland currently has an `` adult proof of age card '' , which is $ 58.05 . 
  your question , as i understand it , is `` how can one be registered to vote but not have a driver 's licence or other id ? '', 
  the answer is very easily . 
  not everyone feels the need to get a driver 's licence , and i do n't know of any reason to have any state-issued id other than that , and for proof of age when buying alcoholic drinks . 
  now , he asked you a question , why do n't you answer it . 
  what reason do you think this should be implemented , considering the low level of voter fraud in australia , and the proven impact it has on disadvantaged groups ? 
  urgh are you really going to make that argument ? 
  you 're like those damn americans saying `` socialised health care might work in your country , but * we 're different * '' , or similar arguments about gun control . 
  no , it has n't been * proven * to work in australia , because there 's never been a * chance * to prove it in australia . 
  but it has been show to be true in other places , and there is n't any reasonable reason to believe it * would n't * hold here . 
  yeah i agree . 
  i enjoyed it the first 2 or 3 times , but now it seems like there 's more of these making the front page than things that * are n't * like this . 
  actually he 's right . 
  my university 's main first year maths courses were completely non-calculator , and my uni in general has a policy of only allowing non-graphical calculators in most courses that * do * allow calculators . 
  different places may have different rules , of course . 
  [ link to the / r/games thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/1vucru/kickstarter_for_kingdom_come_deliverance_by/ ) . 
  the game will support windows , mac , and linux , as well as ( subject to approval by the platform ) ps4 and xbone . 
  planetary annihilation got crowd funded and looks like it 's turning out to be a fantastic game . 
  plus , this game is n't exclusively crowd funded . 
  the kickstarter is basically a test to see if there is enough audience interest , so that a more traditional publisher wo n't be risking too much money by investing in it . 
  neither does this game or any other . 
  you 've got the option to help provide funding for the game . 
  if you do n't want to do that , then you still have the option of buying it after it 's released . 
  you need to learn to explain things that you say . 
  and also stop being a prick . 
  my nexus 7 fits in large front pockets and many back pockets . 
  it 's much easier to hold one handed for reading or watching a video , and the smaller keyboard makes typing easier . 
  and there 's really no particular disadvantage . 
  all the buttons on all the apps i 've used were easily large enough to press without issue , and the screen real estate was never a particular issue . 
  actually , [ you can use photoshop ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?mt=8 ) . 
  personally though , i 'm an android user . 
  got a nexus 7 and 4 . 
  but i do love my macbook pro . 
  they just blow any other laptop out of the water . 
  and a custom desktop pc rounds my collection out for gaming . 
  true , but quantity \u221d content density . 
  wow that looks tiny and unreadable . 
  it 's the sign for proportionality . 
  it 's great for carrying it around temporarily . 
  it 's not something i 'd take out and about with me , but for a brief walk between two places it works just fine . 
  it 's not hard to remember to take it out before sitting down . 
  it does seem rather small , but according to [ their blog ] ( http://warhorsestudios.cz/pages/blog/img/blog_011_7.jpg ) it 's the same size as oblivion . 
  so perhaps their method for measuring the size of games is wrong , but at least their game will match up with that size . 
  i 'm wondering if perhaps their wording is out . 
  3.5 square miles is a 1.9 x 1.9 box , but maybe they 're got their terminology incorrect ; maybe them saying 3.5 square miles is their way of saying it 's a 3.5 x 3.5 square mile box . 
  i 'm a guy and i 've never had running shorts with pockets ... 
  when i 've gone running in other sporting shorts that * do * have pockets , it 's so incredibly uncomfortable . 
  i do n't get why you would want to do it . 
  ( that said , i really do feel for women with regards to every-day clothes . 
  i could n't stand not having big pockets . ), 
  they 're aiming for a release late 2015 . 
   learned ( learnt ? ... ), 
  both are accepted spellings . 
  the former is more common in the us , while the latter is more common in the uk . 
   want more responses ? 
  create a survey instead of putting your questions in a self-post !, 
  also for `` what types of interactions with others do you do using these technologies ? '', 
  it might be worthwhile giving some examples . 
  actually the dyson airblades use a filter which supposedly fixes this problem . 
  they 're also really , really good at actually drying your hands , unlike normal hand driers . 
  but the main point was still that [ you should really create a survey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dznr0.png ) rather than asking for self post replies . 
  we recommend [ google drive ] ( https://drive.google.com/ ) or [ instant.ly ] ( http://www.instant.ly/ ) . 
  ** exactly ** . 
  yeah , you do n't have any particular * right * protecting you from this , but the request is absolutely dumb and unreasonable , and the university should really not allow it . 
  if you really want to , require them to turn off their phones , but anything more than that is just dumb . 
  personally , though , i find that my phone is often quite useful during class so i can look something up that the lecturer only skipped over , or something tangentially related , but other than that i do n't typically use it in class . 
  personally i do n't think it would be beneficial to my learning experience if i were told not to use the phone * at all * in class . 
  besides , if it 's on silent , anyone using their phone for off-topic stuff in class is only hurting themselves . 
  i say they should be allowed to do it . 
  if this really bothers the lecturer , and they want to tell people not to use their phone at all , then fine , people just have to deal with it , but it 's a bad rule . 
  i think you 're misinterpreting the results of that experiment . 
  i thought it was somehow count vertigo . 
  i do n't know about you , but if i was doing something , and someone decided to almost beat me to death because of it , i 'm probably going to rethink things . 
  yeah i thought roy at first , and then i started thinking it was count vertigo , before they finally revealed it properly . 
  i very rarely squeal at tv shows out loud . 
  a lot of wows and excitement happens on the inside , but i rarely make a sound . 
  but the end of this episode , when ollie was talking to roy about training him , i squealed like a little girl . 
  i am so damn excited about that . 
  i remember in my first few months on reddit there was [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/t70j8/a_semicompetent_genie_grants_you_two_wishes_out/ ) . 
  i wish there was more like that . 
  actually yeah , that 's a good point . 
  that said , learned in that sense is archaic . 
  i prefer to think of classical with a small c and classical with a big c. big c classical is music from most of the 1700s . 
  specifically , from the date of bach 's death until the day of the premier of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  3 , although the borders are somewhat murky . 
  little c classical is the `` genre '' ( the way genre is used in modern music , not to be confused with the term genre as used * within * art music , where it often refers to e.g. 
  ) , encompassing everything from late renaissance music to much of the 20th century art music . 
  / u/joavim is somewhat correct . 
  the term classical can be used to refer to either the specific classical era , or to the general genre , and it 's usually not ambiguous which is meant . 
  op 's use was fine . 
  for a brief overview of how i personally distinguish the terms , see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/1vxfhl/claude_debussy_clair_de_lune_classical/cewvr63?context=3 ), 
  that said , i really would encourage you to learn more about it . 
  there 's as much variety within the classical genre as there is in all types of `` popular '' music ( e.g. 
  rock 'n' roll , rock , country , pop , metal , rap , etc. ), 
  combined . 
  it makes sense , when you think that it consists of every piece composed from 1600 to 1900 , and a lot of music after 1900 , too .
